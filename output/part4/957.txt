an American inventor and businessman  He developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world  including the phonograph  the motion picture camera  and a long lasting  practical electric light bulb  Dubbed  The Wizard of Menlo Park   now Edison  New Jersey  by a newspaper reporter  he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large teamwork to the process of invention  and because of that  he is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory  1  Edison is the fourth most prolific inventor in history  holding 1 093 US patents in his name  as well as many patents in the United Kingdom  France  and Germany  He is credited with numerous inventions that contributed to mass communication and  in particular  telecommunications  These included a stock ticker  a mechanical vote recorder  a battery for an electric car  electrical power  recorded music and motion pictures  His advanced work in these fields was an outgrowth of his early career as a telegraph operator  Edison originated the concept and implementation of electric power generation and distribution to homes  businesses  and factories   a crucial development in the modern industrialized world  His first power station was on Manhattan Island  New York  Contents 1 Early life 2 Telegrapher 3 Marriages and children 4 Beginning his career 5

Scotia  Canada  and Nancy Matthews Elliott  1810 1871  born in Chenango County  New York   2  citation needed  His father had to escape from Canada because he took part in the unsuccessful Mackenzie Rebellion of 1837  citation needed  Edison considered himself to be of Dutch ancestry  3  In school  the young Edison s mind often wandered  and his teacher  the Reverend Engle  was overheard calling him  addled   This ended Edison s three months of official schooling  Edison recalled later   My mother was the making of me  She was so true  so sure of me  and I felt I had something to live for  someone I must not disappoint   His mother homeschooled him  4  Much of his education came from reading R G  Parker s School of Natural Philosophy and The Cooper Union  Edison developed hearing problems at an early age  The cause of his deafness has been attributed to a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle ear infections  Around the middle of his career Edison attributed the hearing impairment to being struck on the ears by a train conductor when his chemical laboratory in a boxcar caught fire and he was thrown off the train in Smiths Creek  Michigan  along with his apparatus and chemicals  In his later years he modified the story to say the injury occurred when the conductor  in helping him onto a moving train  lifted him by the ears  5  6  Edison s family was forced to move to Port Huron  Michigan  when the railroad bypassed Milan in 1854  7  but his life there was bittersweet  He sold candy and newspapers on trains running from Port Huron to Detroit  and he sold vegetables to supplement his income  He also studied qualitative analysis  and conducted chemical experiments on the train until an accident caused the prohibition of further work of the kind  8  He obtained the exclusive right of selling newspapers on the road  and  with the aid of four assistants  he set in type and printed the Grand Trunk Herald  which he sold with his other papers  8  This began Edison s long streak of entrepreneurial ventures as he discovered his talents as a businessman  These talents eventually led him to found 14 companies  including General Electric  which is still in existence as one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world  9  10  Telegrapher Edison became a telegraph operator after he saved three year old Jimmie MacKenzie from being struck by a runaway train  Jimmie s father  station agent J U  MacKenzie of Mount Clemens  Michigan  was so grateful that he trained Edison as a telegraph operator  Edison s first telegraphy job away from Port Huron was at Stratford Junction  Ontario  on the Grand Trunk Railway  11  In 1866  at the age of 19  Thomas Edison moved to Louisville  Kentucky  where  as an employee of Western Union  he worked the Associated Press bureau news wire  Edison requested the night shift  which allowed him plenty of time to spend at his two favorite pastimes reading and experimenting  Eventually  the latter pre occupation cost him his job  One night in 1867  he was working with a lead acid battery when he spilled sulfuric acid onto the floor  It ran between the floorboards and onto his boss s desk below  The next morning Edison was fired  12  One of his mentors during those early years was a fellow telegrapher and inventor named Franklin Leonard Pope  who allowed the impoverished youth to live and work in the basement of his Elizabeth  New Jersey home  Some of Edison s earliest inventions were related to telegraphy  including a stock ticker  His first patent was for the electric vote recorder   U S  Patent 90 646   13  which was granted on June 1  1869  14  Marriages and children Mina Edison in 1906 On December 25  1871  Edison married 16 year old Mary Stilwell  whom he had met two months earlier as she was an employee at one of his shops  They had three children  Marion Estelle Edison  1873 1965   nicknamed  Dot  15  Thomas Alva Edison  Jr   1876 1935   nicknamed  Dash  16  William Leslie Edison  1878 1937  Inventor  graduate of the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale  1900  17  Mary Edison died on August 9  1884  of unknown causes  possibly from a brain tumor  18  possibly from a morphine overdose  19  On February 24  1886  at the age of thirty nine  Edison married 20 year old Mina Miller in Akron  Ohio  20  She was the daughter of inventor Lewis Miller  co founder of the Chautauqua Institution and a benefactor of Methodist charities  They also had three children  Madeleine Edison  1888 1979   who married John Eyre Sloane  21  22  Charles Edison  1890 1969   who took over the company upon his father s death and who later was elected Governor of New Jersey  23  He also took charge of his father s experimental laboratories in West Orange  Theodore Edison  1898 1992    MIT Physics 1923   had over 80 patents to his credit  Mina outlived Thomas Edison  dying on August 24  1947  24  25  Beginning his career Photograph of Edison with his phonograph  2nd model   taken in Mathew Brady s Washington  DC studio in April 1878  Mary Had a Little Lamb Thomas Edison reciting  Mary Had a Little Lamb  Problems listening to this file  See media help  Thomas Edison began his career as an inventor in Newark  New Jersey  with the automatic repeater and his other improved telegraphic devices  but the invention that first gained him notice was the phonograph in 1877  This accomplishment was so unexpected by the public at large as to appear almost magical  Edison became known as  The Wizard of Menlo Park   New Jersey  His first phonograph recorded on tinfoil around a grooved cylinder  but had poor sound quality and the recordings could be played only a few times  In the 1880s  a redesigned model using wax coated cardboard cylinders was produced by Alexander Graham Bell  Chichester Bell  and Charles Tainter  This was one reason that Thomas Edison continued work on his own  Perfected Phonograph   Menlo Park  1876 1881  Edison s Menlo Park Laboratory  removed to Greenfield Village at Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn  Michigan   Note the organ against the back wall  Edison s major innovation was the first industrial research lab  which was built in Menlo Park  New Jersey  It was built with the funds from the sale of Edison s quadruplex telegraph  After his demonstration of the telegraph  Edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for  4 000 to  5 000 was right  so he asked Western Union to make a bid  He was surprised to hear them offer  10 000  citation needed    202 000 USD 2010  which he gratefully accepted  The quadruplex telegraph was Edison s first big financial success  and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement  Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there  though many employees carried out research and development under his direction  His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research  and he drove them hard to produce results  William Joseph Hammer  a consulting electrical engineer  began his duties as a laboratory assistant to Edison in December 1879  He assisted in experiments on the telephone  phonograph  electric railway  iron ore separator  electric lighting  and other developing inventions  However  Hammer worked primarily on the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that device  In 1880  he was appointed chief engineer of the Edison Lamp Works  In his first year  the plant under General Manager Francis Robbins Upton turned out 50 000 lamps  According to Edison  Hammer was  a pioneer of incandescent electric lighting   Thomas Edison s first successful light bulb model  used in public demonstration at Menlo Park  December 1879 Nearly all of Edison s patents were utility patents  which were protected for a 17 year period and included inventions or processes that are electrical  mechanical  or chemical in nature  About a dozen were design patents  which protect an ornamental design for up to a 14 year period  As in most patents  the inventions he described were improvements over prior art  The phonograph patent  in contrast  was unprecedented as describing the first device to record and reproduce sounds  26  Edison did not invent the first electric light bulb  but instead invented the first commercially practical incandescent light  citation needed  Many earlier inventors had previously devised incandescent lamps  including Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans  Others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included Humphry Davy  James Bowman Lindsay  Moses G  Farmer  27 William E  Sawyer  Joseph Swan and Heinrich G bel  Some of these early bulbs had such flaws as an extremely short life  high expense to produce  and high electric current drawn  making them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially  28  In 1878  Edison applied the term filament to the element of glowing wire carrying the current  although the English inventor Joseph Swan had used the term prior to this  Swan developed an incandescent light with a long lasting filament at about the same time as Edison  as Swan s earlier bulbs lacked the high resistance needed to be an effective part of an electrical utility  Edison and his co workers set about the task of creating longer lasting bulbs  In Britain  Joseph Swan had been able to obtain a patent on the incandescent lamp  though Edison had already been making successful lamps for some time  his patent application was incompletely prepared and failed  28  Unable to raise the required capital in Britain because of this  Edison was forced to enter into a joint venture with Swan  known as Ediswan   Swan acknowledged that Edison had anticipated him  saying  Edison is entitled to more than I     he has seen further into this subject  vastly than I  and foreseen and provided for details that I did not comprehend until I saw his system   29  By 1879  Edison had produced a new concept  a high resistance lamp in a very high vacuum  which would burn for hundreds of hours  While the earlier inventors had produced electric lighting in laboratory conditions  dating back to a demonstration of a glowing wire by Alessandro Volta in 1800  Edison concentrated on commercial application  and was able to sell the concept to homes and businesses by mass producing relatively long lasting light bulbs and creating a complete system for the generation and distribution of electricity  In just over a decade Edison s Menlo Park laboratory had expanded to occupy two city blocks  Edison said he wanted the lab to have  a stock of almost every conceivable material   A newspaper article printed in 1887 reveals the seriousness of his claim  stating the lab contained  eight thousand kinds of chemicals  every kind of screw made  every size of needle  every kind of cord or wire  hair of humans  horses  hogs  cows  rabbits  goats  minx  camels     silk in every texture  cocoons  various kinds of hoofs  shark s teeth  deer horns  tortoise shell     cork  resin  varnish and oil  ostrich feathers  a peacock s tail  jet  amber  rubber  all ores      and the list goes on  30  Over his desk  Edison displayed a placard with Sir Joshua Reynolds  famous quotation   There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking   31  This slogan was reputedly posted at several other locations throughout the facility  With Menlo Park  Edison had created the first industrial laboratory concerned with creating knowledge and then controlling its application  Carbon telephone transmitter In 1877 78  Edison invented and developed the carbon microphone used in all telephones along with the Bell receiver until the 1980s  After protracted patent litigation  in 1892 a federal court ruled that Edison and not Emile Berliner was the inventor of the carbon microphone  The carbon microphone was also used in radio broadcasting and public address work through the 1920s  Electric light Main article  History of the light bulb Edison in 1878 Building on the contributions of other developers over the previous three quarters of a century  Edison made improvements to the idea of incandescent light  and entered the public consciousness as  the inventor  of the lightbulb  and a prime mover in developing the necessary infrastructure for electric power  After many experiments with platinum and other metal filaments  Edison returned to a carbon filament  The first successful test was on October 22  1879  32  it lasted 13 5 hours  33  Edison continued to improve this design and by November 4  1879  filed for U S  patent 223 898  granted on January 27  1880  for an electric lamp using  a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected to platina contact wires   34  Although the patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including  cotton and linen thread  wood splints  papers coiled in various ways   34  it was not until several months after the patent was granted that Edison and his team discovered a carbonized bamboo filament that could last over 1 200 hours  The idea of using this particular raw material originated from Edison s recalling his examination of a few threads from a bamboo fishing pole while relaxing on the shore of Battle Lake in the present day state of Wyoming  where he and other members of a scientific team had traveled so that they could clearly observe a total eclipse of the sun on July 29  1878  from the Continental Divide  35  U S  Patent 223898  Electric Lamp  Issued January 27  1880  In 1878  Edison formed the Edison Electric Light Company in New York City with several financiers  including J  P  Morgan and the members of the Vanderbilt family  Edison made the first public demonstration of his incandescent light bulb on December 31  1879  in Menlo Park  It was during this time that he said   We will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles   36  Lewis Latimer joined the Edison Electric Light Company in 1884  Latimer had received a patent in January 1881 for the  Process of Manufacturing Carbons   an improved method for the production of carbon filaments for lightbulbs  Latimer worked as an engineer  a draftsman and an expert witness in patent litigation on electric lights  37  George Westinghouse s company bought Philip Diehl s competing induction lamp patent rights  1882  for  25 000  forcing the holders of the Edison patent to charge a more reasonable rate for the use of the Edison patent rights and lowering the price of the electric lamp  38  On October 8  1883  the US patent office ruled that Edison s patent was based on the work of William Sawyer and was therefore invalid  Litigation continued for nearly six years  until October 6  1889  when a judge ruled that Edison s electric light improvement claim for  a filament of carbon of high resistance  was valid  To avoid a possible court battle with Joseph Swan  whose British patent had been awarded a year before Edison s  he and Swan formed a joint company called Ediswan to manufacture and market the invention in Britain  Mahen Theatre in Brno  in what is now the Czech Republic  was the first public building in the world to use Edison s electric lamps  with the installation supervised by Edison s assistant in the invention of the lamp  Francis Jehl  39  In September 2010  a sculpture of three giant light bulbs was erected in Brno  in front of the theatre  40  Electric power distribution Edison patented a system for electricity distribution in 1880  which was essential to capitalize on the invention of the electric lamp  On December 17  1880  Edison founded the Edison Illuminating Company  The company established the first investor owned electric utility in 1882 on Pearl Street Station  New York City  It was on September 4  1882  that Edison switched on his Pearl Street generating station s electrical power distribution system  which provided 110 volts direct current  DC  to 59 customers in lower Manhattan  41  Earlier in the year  in January 1882  he had switched on the first steam generating power station at Holborn Viaduct in London  The DC supply system provided electricity supplies to street lamps and several private dwellings within a short distance of the station  On January 19  1883  the first standardized incandescent electric lighting system employing overhead wires began service in Roselle  New Jersey  War of currents Main article  War of Currents Extravagant displays of electric lights quickly became a feature of public events  as in this picture from the 1897 Tennessee Centennial Exposition  Edison s true success  like that of his friend Henry Ford  was in his ability to maximize profits through establishment of mass production systems and intellectual property rights  George Westinghouse and Edison became adversaries because of Edison s promotion of direct current  DC  for electric power distribution instead of the more easily transmitted alternating current  AC  system invented by Nikola Tesla and promoted by Westinghouse  Unlike DC  AC could be stepped up to very high voltages with transformers  sent over thinner and cheaper wires  and stepped down again at the destination for distribution to users  In 1887 there were 121 Edison power stations in the United States delivering DC electricity to customers  When the limitations of DC were discussed by the public  Edison launched a propaganda campaign to convince people that AC was far too dangerous to use  The problem with DC was that the power plants could economically deliver DC electricity only to customers within about one and a half miles  about 2 4 km  from the generating station  so that it was suitable only for central business districts  When George Westinghouse suggested using high voltage AC instead  as it could carry electricity hundreds of miles with marginal loss of power  Edison waged a  War of Currents  to prevent AC from being adopted  The war against AC led him to become involved in the development and promotion of the electric chair  using AC  as an attempt to portray AC to have greater lethal potential than DC  Edison went on to carry out a brief but intense campaign to ban the use of AC or to limit the allowable voltage for safety purposes  As part of this campaign  Edison s employees publicly electrocuted animals to demonstrate the dangers of AC  42  43  alternating electric currents are slightly more dangerous in that frequencies near 60 Hz have a markedly greater potential for inducing fatal  cardiac fibrillation  than do direct currents  44  On one of the more notable occasions  in 1903  Edison s workers electrocuted Topsy the elephant at Luna Park  near Coney Island  after she had killed several men and her owners wanted her put to death  45  His company filmed the electrocution  AC replaced DC in most instances of generation and power distribution  enormously extending the range and improving the efficiency of power distribution  Though widespread use of DC ultimately lost favor for distribution  it exists today primarily in long distance high voltage direct current  HVDC  transmission systems  Low voltage DC distribution continued to be used in high density downtown areas for many years but was eventually replaced by AC low voltage network distribution in many of them  46  DC had the advantage that large battery banks could maintain continuous power through brief interruptions of the electric supply from generators and the transmission system  Utilities such as Commonwealth Edison in Chicago had rotary converters or motor generator sets  which could change DC to AC and AC to various frequencies in the early to mid 20th century  Utilities supplied rectifiers to convert the low voltage AC to DC for such DC loads as elevators  fans and pumps  There were still 1 600 DC customers in downtown New York City as of 2005  and service was finally discontinued only on November 14  2007  46  Most subway systems are still powered by direct current  Fluoroscopy Edison is credited with designing and producing the first commercially available fluoroscope  a machine that uses X rays to take radiographs  Until Edison discovered that calcium tungstate fluoroscopy screens produced brighter images than the barium platinocyanide screens originally used by Wilhelm R ntgen  the technology was capable of producing only very faint images  The fundamental design of Edison s fluoroscope is still in use today  despite the fact that Edison himself abandoned the project after nearly losing his own eyesight and seriously injuring his assistant  Clarence Dally  Dally had made himself an enthusiastic human guinea pig for the fluoroscopy project and in the process been exposed to a poisonous dose of radiation  He later died of injuries related to the exposure  In 1903  a shaken Edison said  Don t talk to me about X rays  I am afraid of them   47  Work relations Photograph of Thomas Edison by Victor Daireaux  Paris  circa 1880s Frank J  Sprague  a competent mathematician and former naval officer  was recruited by Edward H  Johnson and joined the Edison organization in 1883  One of Sprague s contributions to the Edison Laboratory at Menlo Park was to expand Edison s mathematical methods  Despite the common belief that Edison did not use mathematics  analysis of his notebooks reveal that he was an astute user of mathematical analysis conducted by his assistants such as Francis Robbins Upton  for example  determining the critical parameters of his electric lighting system including lamp resistance by an analysis of Ohm s Law  Joule s Law and economics  48  Another of Edison s assistants was Nikola Tesla  Tesla claimed that Edison had promised him  50 000 if he succeeded in making improvements to his DC generation plants  Several months later  when Tesla had finished the work and asked to be paid  he said that Edison replied   When you become a full fledged American you will appreciate an American joke   49  Tesla immediately resigned  With Tesla s salary of  18 per week  the payment would have amounted to over 53 years  pay and the amount was equal to the initial capital of the company  Another account states that Tesla resigned when he was refused a raise to  25 per week  50  Although Tesla accepted an Edison Medal later in life  this and other negative events concerning Edison remained with him  The day after Edison died  the New York Times contained extensive coverage of Edison s life  with the only negative opinion coming from Tesla who was quoted as saying  He had no hobby  cared for no sort of amusement of any kind and lived in utter disregard of the most elementary rules of hygiene        His method was inefficient in the extreme  for an immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and  at first  I was almost a sorry witness of his doings  knowing that just a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90  of the labour  But he had a veritable contempt for book learning and mathematical knowledge  trusting himself entirely to his inventor s instinct and practical American sense  51   Nikola Tesla One of Edison s famous quotations about his attempts to make the light globe suggest that perhaps Tesla was right about Edison s methods of working   If I find 10 000 ways something won t work  I haven t failed  I am not discouraged  because every wrong attempt discarded is another step forward   52  When Edison was a very old man and close to death  he said  in looking back  that the biggest mistake he had made was in not respecting Tesla or his work  53  There were 28 men recognized as Edison Pioneers  Media inventions The key to Edison s fortunes was telegraphy  With knowledge gained from years of working as a telegraph operator  he learned the basics of electricity  This allowed him to make his early fortune with the stock ticker  the first electricity based broadcast system  Edison patented the sound recording and reproducing phonograph in 1878  Edison was also granted a patent for the motion picture camera or  Kinetograph   He did the electromechanical design  while his employee W K L  Dickson  a photographer  worked on the photographic and optical development  Much of the credit for the invention belongs to Dickson  32  In 1891  Thomas Edison built a Kinetoscope  or peep hole viewer  This device was installed in penny arcades  where people could watch short  simple films  The kinetograph and kinetoscope were both first publicly exhibited May 20  1891  54  On August 9  1892  Edison received a patent for a two way telegraph  In April 1896  Thomas Armat s Vitascope  manufactured by the Edison factory and marketed in Edison s name  was used to project motion pictures in public screenings in New York City  Later he exhibited motion pictures with voice soundtrack on cylinder recordings  mechanically synchronized with the film  The June 1894 Leonard Cushing bout  Each of the six one minute rounds recorded by the Kinetoscope was made available to exhibitors for  22 50  55  Customers who watched the final round saw Leonard score a knockdown  Officially the kinetoscope entered Europe when the rich American Businessman Irving T  Bush  1869 1948  bought from the Continental Commerce Company of Frank Z  Maguire and Joseph D  Baucus a dozen machines  Bush placed from October 17  1894  the first kinetoscopes in London  At the same time the French company Kin toscope Edison Michel et Alexis Werner bought these machines for the market in France  In the last three months of 1894  The Continental Commerce Company sold hundreds of kinetoscopes in Europe  i e  the Netherlands and Italy   In Germany and in Austria Hungary the kinetoscope was introduced by the Deutsche  sterreichische Edison Kinetoscop Gesellschaft  founded by the Ludwig Stollwerck 56  of the Schokoladen S sswarenfabrik Stollwerck  amp  Co of Cologne  The first kinetoscopes arrived in Belgium at the Fairs in early 1895  The Edison s Kin toscope Fran ais  a Belgian company  was founded in Brussels on January 15  1895  with the rights to sell the kinetoscopes in Monaco  France and the French colonies  The main investors in this company were Belgian industrialists  57  On May 14  1895  the Edison s Kin toscope Belge was founded in Brussels  The businessman Ladislas Victor Lewitzki  living in London but active in Belgium and France  took the initiative in starting this business  He had contacts with Leon Gaumont and the American Mutoscope and Biograph Co  In 1898 he also became a shareholder of the Biograph and Mutoscope Company for France  57  In 1901  he visited the Sudbury area in Ontario  Canada  as a mining prospector  and is credited with the original discovery of the Falconbridge ore body  His attempts to mine the ore body were not successful  however  and he abandoned his mining claim in 1903  58  A street in Falconbridge  as well as the Edison Building  which served as the head office of Falconbridge Mines  are named for him  In 1902  agents of Thomas Edison bribed a theater owner in London for a copy of A Trip to the Moon by Georges M li s  Edison then made hundreds of copies and showed them in New York City  M li s received no compensation  He was counting on taking the film to the US and recapture its huge cost by showing it throughout the country when he realized it had already been shown there by Edison  This effectively bankrupted M li s  59  Other exhibitors similarly routinely copied and exhibited each others films  60  To better protect the copyrights on his films  Edison deposited prints of them on long strips of photographic paper with the U S  copyright office  Many of these paper prints survived longer and in better condition than the actual films of that era  61  Edison s favorite movie was The Birth of a Nation  He thought that talkies had  spoiled everything  for him   There isn t any good acting on the screen  They concentrate on the voice now and have forgotten how to act  I can sense it more than you because I am deaf   62  His favorite stars were Mary Pickford and Clara Bow  63  In 1908  Edison started the Motion Picture Patents Company  which was a conglomerate of nine major film studios  commonly known as the Edison Trust   Thomas Edison was the first honorary fellow of the Acoustical Society of America  which was founded in 1929  West Orange and Fort Myers  1886 1931  Thomas A  Edison Industries Exhibit  Primary Battery section  1915 Henry Ford  Thomas Edison  and Harvey Firestone  respectively  Ft  Myers  Florida  February 11  1929 Edison moved from Menlo Park after the death of Mary Stilwell and purchased a home known as  Glenmont  in 1886 as a wedding gift for Mina in Llewellyn Park in West Orange  New Jersey  In 1885  Thomas Edison bought property in Fort Myers  Florida  and built what was later called Seminole Lodge as a winter retreat  Edison and his wife Mina spent many winters in Fort Myers where they recreated and Edison tried to find a domestic source of natural rubber  Henry Ford  the automobile magnate  later lived a few hundred feet away from Edison at his winter retreat in Fort Myers  Florida  Edison even contributed technology to the automobile  They were friends until Edison s death  In 1928  Edison joined the Fort Myers Civitan Club  He believed strongly in the organization  writing that  The Civitan Club is doing things  big things  for the community  state  and nation  and I certainly consider it an honor to be numbered in its ranks   64  He was an active member in the club until his death  sometimes bringing Henry Ford to the club s meetings  The final years Edison was active in business right up to the end  Just months before his death in 1931  the Lackawanna Railroad implemented electric trains in suburban service from Hoboken to Gladstone  Montclair and Dover in New Jersey  Transmission was by means of an overhead catenary system  with the entire project under Edison s guidance  To the surprise of many  he was at the throttle of the very first MU  Multiple Unit  train to depart Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken  driving the train all the way to Dover  65  As another tribute to his lasting legacy  the same fleet of cars Edison deployed on the Lackawanna in 1931 served commuters until their retirement in 1984  when some of them were purchased by the Berkshire Scenic Railway Museum in Lenox  Massachusetts  A special plaque commemorating the joint achievement of both the railway and Edison can be seen today in the waiting room of Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken  presently operated by New Jersey Transit  65  Edison was said to have been influenced by a popular fad diet in his last few years   the only liquid he consumed was a pint of milk every three hours   32  He is reported to have believed this diet would restore his health  However  this tale is doubtful  In 1930  the year before Edison died  Mina said in an interview about him that  Correct eating is one of his greatest hobbies   She also said that during one of his periodic  great scientific adventures   Edison would be up at 7 00  have breakfast at 8 00  and be rarely home for lunch or dinner  implying that he continued to have all three  62  Edison became the owner of his Milan  Ohio  birthplace in 1906  On his last visit  in 1923  he was shocked to find his old home still lit by lamps and candles  Thomas Edison died of complications of diabetes on October 18  1931  in his home   Glenmont  in Llewellyn Park in West Orange  New Jersey  which he had purchased in 1886 as a wedding gift for Mina  He is buried behind the home  66  67  Edison s last breath is reportedly contained in a test tube at the Henry Ford Museum  Ford reportedly convinced Charles Edison to seal a test tube of air in the inventor s room shortly after his death  as a memento  A plaster death mask was also made  68  Mina died in 1947  Views on politics  religion and metaphysics Historian Paul Israel has characterized Edison as a  freethinker   32  Edison was heavily influenced by Thomas Paine s The Age of Reason  32  Edison defended Paine s  scientific deism   saying   He has been called an atheist  but atheist he was not  Paine believed in a supreme intelligence  as representing the idea which other men often express by the name of deity   32  In an October 2  1910  interview in the New York Times Magazine  Edison stated  Nature is what we know  We do not know the gods of religions  And nature is not kind  or merciful  or loving  If God made me   the fabled God of the three qualities of which I spoke  mercy  kindness  love   He also made the fish I catch and eat  And where do His mercy  kindness  and love for that fish come in  No  nature made us   nature did it all   not the gods of the religions  69  Edison was called an atheist for those remarks  and although he did not allow himself to be drawn into the controversy publicly  he clarified himself in a private letter   You have misunderstood the whole article  because you jumped to the conclusion that it denies the existence of God  There is no such denial  what you call God I call Nature  the Supreme intelligence that rules matter  All the article states is that it is doubtful in my opinion if our intelligence or soul or whatever one may call it lives hereafter as an entity or disperses back again from whence it came  scattered amongst the cells of which we are made   32  Nonviolence was key to Edison s moral views  and when asked to serve as a naval consultant for World War I  he specified he would work only on defensive weapons and later noted   I am proud of the fact that I never invented weapons to kill   Edison s philosophy of nonviolence extended to animals as well  about which he stated   Nonviolence leads to the highest ethics  which is the goal of all evolution  Until we stop harming all other living beings  we are still savages   70  However  he is also notorious for having electrocuted a number of dogs in 1888  both by direct and alternating current  in an attempt to argue that the former  which he had a vested business interest in promoting  was safer than the latter  favored by his rival George Westinghouse   71  Edison s success in promoting direct current as less lethal also led to alternating current being used in the electric chair adopted by New York in 1889 as a supposedly humane execution method  Because Westinghouse was angered by the decision  he funded Eighth Amendment based appeals for inmates set to die in the electric chair  ultimately resulting in Edison providing the generators which powered early electrocutions and testifying successfully on behalf of the state that electrocution was a painless method of execution  72  Tributes Places and people named for Edison Several places have been named after Edison  most notably the town of Edison  New Jersey
