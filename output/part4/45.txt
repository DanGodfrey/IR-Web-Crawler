practice it can also be found in the graphic and performing arts  In satire  vices  follies  abuses  and shortcomings are held up to ridicule  ideally with the intent of shaming individuals  and society itself  into improvement  1  Although satire is usually meant to be funny  its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism  using wit as a weapon  A common feature of satire is strong irony or sarcasm  in satire  irony is militant  2  but parody  burlesque  exaggeration  juxtaposition  comparison  analogy  and double entendre are all frequently used in satirical speech and writing  This  militant  irony or sarcasm often professes to approve of  or at least accept as natural  the very things the satirist wishes to attack  Satire is nowadays found in many artistic forms of expression  including literature  plays  commentary  and media such as lyrics  Contents 1 Term 2 Satire and humour 3 Social and psychological functions 4 Classifications of Satire 4 1 Horatian vs

12 Further reading  edit  Term The word satire comes from the Latin word satur and the subsequent phrase lanx satura  Satur meant  full   but the juxtaposition with lanx shifted the meaning to  miscellany or medley   the expression lanx satura literally means  a full dish of various kinds of fruits   3  The word satura as used by Quintilian  however  was used to denote only Roman verse satire  a strict genre that imposed hexameter form  a narrower genre than what would be later intended as satire  4  3  Quintilian famously said that satura  that is a satire in hexameter verses  was a literary genre of wholly Roman origin  satura tota nostra est   He was aware of and commented on Greek satire  but at the time did not label it as such  although today the origin of satire is considered to be Aristophanes  Old Comedy  The first critic to use satire in the modern broader sense was Apuleius  3  The derivation of satire from satura properly has nothing to do with the Greek mythological figure satyr  5  To Quintilian  the satire was a strict literary form  but the term soon escaped from the original narrow definition  Robert Elliott writes   As soon as a noun enters the domain of metaphor  as one modern scholar has pointed out  it clamours for extension  and satura  which had had no verbal  adverbial  or adjectival forms  was immediately broadened by appropriation from the Greek word for  satyr   satyros  and its derivatives  The odd result is that the English  satire  comes from the Latin satura  but  satirize    satiric   etc   are of Greek origin  By about the 4th century AD the writer of satires came to be known as satyricus  St  Jerome  for example  was called by one of his enemies  a satirist in prose    satyricus scriptor in prosa    Subsequent orthographic modifications obscured the Latin origin of the word satire  satura becomes satyra  and in England  by the 16th century  it was written  satyre    6   edit  Satire and humour Satirical works often contain  straight  humour  usually to give relief from what might otherwise be relentless preaching  Although this has always been so  it is probably more marked in modern satire  Yet some satire is not  funny   nor is meant to be  Obviously  not all humour   even on such topics as politics  religion or art  or using the great satirical tools of irony  parody  and burlesque   is necessarily  satirical   the most light hearted satire always has a serious  after taste   The Ig Nobel Prize satire on trivial scientific research describes this as  first make people laugh  and then make them think    a fair definition of satire itself   7   edit  Social and psychological functions Satire and irony in some cases have been regarded as the most effective source to understand a society  the oldest form of social study  8  They are effective in exposing a society s structures of power and providing the keenest insights into its collective psyche and values  Some authors have regarded satire as superior to non comic and non artistic disciplines like history or anthropology  8  9  10  11  In a prominent example from Ancient Greece  philosopher Plato  when asked by a friend for a book to understand Athenian society  referred him to the plays of Aristophanes  12  13  The state of political satire in a given country reflects the state of civil liberties and human rights  Under totalitarian regimes any criticism of a political system including satire is suppressed  A typical example is the Soviet Union where the dissidents  such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov were under strong pressure from the government  While satire of everyday life in the USSR was allowed  the most prominent satirist being Arkady Raikin  political satire existed in the form of anecdotes 14  that made fun of Soviet political leaders  especially Brezhnev  famous for his narrow mindness and love for awards and decorations   edit  Classifications of Satire  edit  Horatian vs Juvenalian  Le satire e l epistole di Q  Orazio Flacco   printed in 1814  Satirical literature can commonly be categorized as either Horatian or Juvenalian  15  although the two are not entirely mutually exclusive  Horatian satire  named for the Roman satirist  Horace  65 BCE   8 BCE   playfully criticizes some social vice through gentle  mild  and light hearted humour  It directs wit  exaggeration  and self deprecating humour toward what it identifies as folly  rather than evil  citation needed  Horatian satire s sympathetic tone is common in modern society  citation needed  Examples of Horatian satire include  Daniel Defoe s The True Born Englishman Alexander Pope s The Rape of the Lock C S  Lewis  The Screwtape Letters Matt Groening s The Simpsons Rick Mercer s The Rick Mercer Report The Ig Nobel Prizes  Have I Got News For You Juvenalian satire  named after the Roman satirist Juvenal  late 1st century   early 2nd century CE   is a type of satire that is more contemptuous and abrasive than the Horatian  Juvenalian satire addresses social evil through scorn  outrage  and savage ridicule  This form is often pessimistic  characterized by irony  sarcasm  moral indignation and personal invective  with less emphasis on humour  Strongly polarized political satire is often Juvenalian  Examples of Juvenalian satire  Joseph Hall s Virgidemiarum Jonathan Swift s A Modest Proposal and The Predictions for the Ensuing Year  written as Isaac Bickerstaff   Samuel Johnson s London Voltaire s Candide George Orwell s Nineteen Eighty Four and Animal Farm Bret Easton Ellis s American Psycho Ray Bradbury s Fahrenheit 451 William Golding s Lord of the Flies Stanley Kubrick s Dr Strangelove or  How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Aldous Huxley s Brave New World Anthony Burgess  A Clockwork Orange Chris Morris s  Brasseye   amp   The Day Today  Joseph Heller s Catch 22 William Burroughs  Naked Lunch Jon Stewart s The Daily Show with Jon Stewart Stephen Colbert s performance at the 2006 White House Correspondents Dinner Trey Parker  amp  Matt Stone s South Park Douglas Adams  Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy citation needed  Julian Barnes  England  England  edit  Satire vs Teasing In the history of theatre there has always been a conflict between engagement and disengagement on politics and relevant issue  between satire and grotesque on one side  and jest with teasing on the other  16 Max Eastman defined the spectrum of satire in terms of  degrees of biting   as ranging from satire proper at the hot end  and  kidding  at the violet end  Eastman adopted the term kidding to denote what is just satirical in form  but is not really firing at the target  17 Nobel laureate satirical playwright Dario Fo pointed out the difference between satire and teasing  sfott    18  Teasing is the reactionary side of the comic  it limits itself to a shallow parody of physical appearance  the side effect of teasing is that it humanizes and draws sympaty for the powerful individual towards which is directed  Satire instead uses the comic to go against power and its oppressions  has a subversive character  and a moral dimension which draws judgement against its targets  19  20  21  Fo formulated an operational criteria to tell real satire from sfott   saying that real satire arouses an outraged and violent reaction  and that the more they try to stop you  the better is the job you are doing  22  Historically  people in positions of power have welcomed and encouraged good humoured buffoonery  while have tried to censor  ostracize and repress satire  16  19  Teasing  sfott   is an ancient form of simple buffoonery  a form of comedy without satire s subversive edge  Teasing includes light and affectionate parody  good humoured mockery  simple one dimensional poking fun  benign spoofs  Teasing typically consists in a impersonation of someone monkeying around with his exterior attributes  tics  physical blemishes  voice and mannerisms  quirks  way of dressing and walking  the phrases he typically repeats  By contrast  teasing never touches on the core issue  never makes a serious criticism judging the target with irony  it never harms the target s conduct  ideology and position of power  it never undermines the perception of his morality and cultural dimension  19  20 Sfott  directed towards a powerful individual  makes him appear more human and draws sympathy towards him  23 Hermann G ring propagated jests and jokes against himself  with the aim of humanizing his image  24  25   edit  Classifications by topics Types of satire can also be classified according to the topics it deals with  From the earliest times  at least since the plays of Aristophanes  the primary topics of literary satire are politics  religion and sex  26  27  28  On one hand because these are the most pressing problems that affect anybody living in a society  and on the other hand because these topics are usually taboo  considered sacred and off limits by social etiquette  26  29  Among these  politics in the broader sense is considered the pre eminent topic of satire  29  Satire which targets the clergy is a type of political satire  while religious satire is that which targets religious beliefs  30  Scatology has a long literary association with satire  26  31  32  The use of scatology is closely related to the grotesque and what is sometimes called the satiric grotesque  26 Shit plays a fundamental role in satire because it symbolizes death  the turd being  the ultimate dead object   32  31  The satirical comparison of individuals or institutions with shit  exposes their  inherent inertness  corruption and dead likeness   31  Another classification by topics  is the distinction between political satire  religious satire and satire of manners  33  Political satire is sometimes called topical satire  satire of manners is sometimes called satire of everyday life  citation needed  and religious satire is sometimes called philosophical satire  Comedy of manners  sometimes also called satire of manners  criticizes mode of life of common people  political satire aims at behavior  manners of politicians  and vices of political systems  philosophical satire has as its object global vices inherent to mankind  citation needed  Historically  Comedy of manners  which first appeared in British theater in 1620  has uncritically accepted the social code of the upper classes  34  Comedy in general accepts the rules of the social game  while satire subverts them  35   edit  Development  edit  Ancient Egypt One of the earliest examples of what we might call satire  The Satire of the Trades  36  is in Egyptian writing from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC  The text s apparent readers are students  tired of studying  It argues that their lot as scribes is useful  and their lot far superior to that of the ordinary man  Scholars such as Helck 37  think that the context was meant to be serious  The Papyrus Anastasi I 38   late 2nd millennium BC  contains a satirical letter which first praises the virtues of its recipient  but then mocks the reader s meagre knowledge and achievements   edit  Greco Roman world The Greeks had no word for what later would be called  satire   although the terms cynicism and parody were used  Modern critics call the Greek playwright Aristophanes one of the best known early satirists  his plays are known for their critical political and societal commentary  39  particularly for the political satire by which he criticized the powerful Cleon  as in The Knights   He is also notable for the persecution he underwent  39  40  41  42  Aristophanes  plays turned upon images of filth and disease  43  His bawdy style was adopted by Greek dramatist comedian Menander  His early play Drunkenness contains an attack on the politician Callimedon  The oldest form of satire still in use is the Menippean satire by Menippus of Gadara  His own writings are lost  Examples from his admirers and imitators mix seriousness and mockery in dialogues and present parodies before a background of diatribe  The reader is meant to question approved truths in order to form a didactic set of knowledge  citation needed  As in the case of Aristophanes plays  menippean satire turned upon images of filth and disease  43  The first Roman to discuss satire critically was Quintilian  who invented the term to describe the writings of Lucilius  The two most prominent and influential ancient Roman satirists are Horace and Juvenal  who wrote during the early days of the Roman Empire  Other important satirists in ancient Latin are Lucilius and Persius  Satire in their work is much wider than in the modern sense of the word  including fantastic and highly coloured humorous writing with little or no real mocking intent  When Horace criticized Augustus  he used veiled ironic terms  In contrast  Pliny reports that the 6th century BC poet Hipponax wrote satirae that were so cruel that the offended hanged themselves  44   edit  Medieval Islamic world Main articles  Arabic satire and Persian satire Medieval Arabic poetry included the satiric genre hija  Satire was introduced into Arabic prose literature by the Afro Arab author Al Jahiz in the 9th century  While dealing with serious topics in what are now known as anthropology  sociology and psychology  he introduced a satirical approach   based on the premise that  however serious the subject under review  it could be made more interesting and thus achieve greater effect  if only one leavened the lump of solemnity by the insertion of a few amusing anecdotes or by the throwing out of some witty or paradoxical observations  He was well aware that  in treating of new themes in his prose works  he would have to employ a vocabulary of a nature more familiar in hija  satirical poetry   45  For example  in one of his zoological works  he satirized the preference for longer human penis size  writing   If the length of the penis were a sign of honor  then the mule would belong to the  honorable tribe of  Quraysh   Another satirical story based on this preference was an Arabian Nights tale called  Ali with the Large Member   46  In the 10th century  the writer Tha alibi recorded satirical poetry written by the Arabic poets As Salami and Abu Dulaf  with As Salami praising Abu Dulaf s wide breadth of knowledge and then mocking his ability in all these subjects  and with Abu Dulaf responding back and satirizing As Salami in return  47  An example of Arabic political satire included another 10th century poet Jarir satirizing Farazdaq as  a transgressor of the Sharia  and later Arabic poets in turn using the term  Farazdaq like  as a form of political satire  48  The terms  comedy  and  satire  became synonymous after Aristotle s Poetics was translated into Arabic in the medieval Islamic world  where it was elaborated upon by Islamic philosophers and writers  such as Abu Bischr  his pupil Al Farabi  Avicenna  and Averroes  Due to cultural differences  they disassociated comedy from Greek dramatic representation and instead identified it with Arabic poetic themes and forms  such as hija  satirical poetry   They viewed comedy as simply the  art of reprehension   and made no reference to light and cheerful events  or troubled beginnings and happy endings  associated with classical Greek comedy  After the Latin translations of the 12th century  the term  comedy  thus gained a new semantic meaning in Medieval literature  49  Ubayd Zakani introduced satire in Persian literature during the 14th century  His work is noted for its satire and obscene verses  often political or bawdy  and often cited in debates involving homosexual practices  He wrote the Resaleh ye Delgosha  as well as Akhlaq al Ashraf   Ethics of the Aristocracy   and the famous humorous fable Masnavi Mush O Gorbeh  Mouse and Cat   which was a political satire  His non satirical serious classical verses have also been regarded as very well written  in league with the other great works of Persian literature  Between 1905 and 1911  Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi and other Iranian writers wrote notable satires   edit  Medieval Europe In the Early Middle Ages  examples of satire were the songs by Goliards or vagants now best known as an anthology called Carmina Burana and made famous as texts of a composition by the 20th century composer Carl Orff  Satirical poetry is believed to have been popular  although little has survived  With the advent of the High Middle Ages and the birth of modern vernacular literature in the 12th century  it began to be used again  most notably by Chaucer  The disrespectful manner was considered  Unchristian  and ignored but for the moral satire  which mocked misbehaviour in Christian terms  Examples are Livre des Mani res by  tienne de Foug res   1170   and some of Chaucer s Canterbury Tales  The epos was mocked  and even the feudal society  but there was hardly a general interest in the genre  Two major satirists of Europe in the Renaissance were Giovanni Boccaccio and Fran ois Rabelais  Other examples of Renaissance satire include Till Eulenspiegel  Reynard the Fox  Sebastian Brant s Narrenschiff  1494   Erasmus  Moriae Encomium  1509  and Thomas More s Utopia  1516    edit  Early modern western satire Direct social commentary via satire returned with a vengeance in the 16th century  when farcical texts such as the works of Fran ois Rabelais tackled more serious issues  and incurred the wrath of the crown as a result   The Elizabethan  i e  16th century English  writers thought of satire as related to the notoriously rude  coarse and sharp satyr play  Elizabethan  satire   typically in pamphlet form  therefore contains more straightforward abuse than subtle irony  The French Huguenot Isaac Casaubon pointed out in 1605 that satire in the Roman fashion was something altogether more civilised  Casaubon discovered and published Quintilian s writing and presented the original meaning of the term  satira  not satyr   and the sense of wittiness  reflecting the  dishfull of fruits   became more important again  17th century English satire once again aimed at the  amendment of vices   Dryden   In the 1590s a new wave of verse satire broke with the publication of Hall s Virgidemiarum  six books of verse satires targeting everything from literary fads to corrupt noblemen  Although Donne had already circulated satires in manuscript  Hall s was the first real attempt in English at verse satire on the Juvenalian model  50  The success of his work combined with a national mood of disillusion in the last years of Elizabeth s reign triggered an avalanche of satire   much of it less conscious of classical models than Hall s   until the fashion was brought to an abrupt stop by censorship  51  The Age of Enlightenment  an intellectual movement in the 17th and 18th century advocating rationality  produced a great revival of satire in Britain  This was fuelled by the rise of partisan politics  with the formalisation of the Tory and Whig parties   and also  in 1714  by the formation of the Scriblerus Club  which included Alexander Pope  Jonathan Swift  John Gay  John Arbuthnot  Robert Harley  Thomas Parnell  and Henry St John  1st Viscount Bolingbroke  This club included several of the notable satirists of early 18th century Britain  They focused their attention on Martinus Scriblerus   an invented learned fool   whose work they attributed all that was tedious  narrow minded  and pedantic in contemporary scholarship   52  In their hands astute and biting satire of institutions and individuals became a popular weapon  Jonathan Swift was one of the greatest of Anglo Irish satirists  and one of the first to practise modern journalistic satire  For instance  In his A Modest Proposal Swift suggests that Irish peasants be encouraged to sell their own children as food for the rich  as a solution to the  problem  of poverty  His purpose is of course to attack indifference to the plight of the desperately poor  In his book Gulliver s Travels he writes about the flaws in human society in general and English society in particular  John Dryden wrote an influential essay entitled  A Discourse Concerning the Original and Progress of Satire   53  that helped fix the definition of satire in the literary world  His satirical Mac Flecknoe was written in response to a rivalry with Thomas Shadwell and eventually inspired Alexander Pope to write his satirical The Rape of the Lock  Other satirical works by Pope include the Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot  Daniel Defoe pursued a more journalistic type of satire  being famous for his The True Born Englishman which mocks xenophobic patriotism  and The Shortest Way with the Dissenters   advocating religious toleration by means of an ironical exaggeration of the highly intolerant attitudes of his time   edit  Anglo American satire Ebenezer Cooke  author of  The Sot Weed Factor   was among the first American colonialists to write literary satire  Benjamin Franklin and others followed  using satire to shape an emerging nation s culture through its sense of the ridiculous  Mark Twain was a great American satirist  his novel Huckleberry Finn is set in the antebellum South  where the moral values Twain wishes to promote are completely turned on their heads  His hero  Huck  is a rather simple but goodhearted lad who is ashamed of the  sinful temptation  that leads him to help a runaway slave  In fact his conscience  warped by the distorted moral world he has grown up in  often bothers him most when he is at his best  Ironically  he is prepared to do good  believing it to be wrong  Twain s younger contemporary Ambrose Bierce gained notoriety as a cynic  pessimist and black humorist with his dark  bitterly ironic stories  many set during the American Civil War  which satirized the limitations of human perception and reason  Bierce s most famous work of satire is probably The Devil s Dictionary  in which the definitions mock cant  hypocrisy and received wisdom   edit  Satire in Victorian England Novelists such as Charles Dickens often used passages of satiric writing in their treatment of social issues  Several satiric papers competed for the public s attention in the Victorian era and Edwardian period  such as Punch and Fun  Perhaps the most enduring examples of Victorian satire  however  are to be found in the Savoy Operas of W  S  Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan  In fact  in The Yeomen of the Guard  a jester is given lines that paint a very neat picture of the method and purpose of the satirist  and might almost be taken as a statement of Gilbert s own intent   I can set a braggart quailing with a quip  The upstart I can wither with a whim  He may wear a merry laugh upon his lip  But his laughter has an echo that is grim    edit  20th century satire Benzino Napaloni and Adenoid Hynkel in The Great Dictator  In the 20th century  satire was used by authors such as Aldous Huxley and George Orwell to make serious and even frightening commentaries on the dangers of the sweeping social changes taking place throughout Europe and United States  The film The Great Dictator  1940  by Charlie Chaplin is a satire on Adolf Hitler  Many social critics of the time  such as Karl Kraus  Dorothy Parker and H  L  Mencken  used satire as their main weapon  and Mencken in particular is noted for having said that  one horse laugh is worth ten thousand syllogisms  in the persuasion of the public to accept a criticism  Joseph Heller s most famous work  Catch 22  satirizes bureaucracy and the military  and is frequently cited as one of the greatest literary works of the twentieth century  54  Novelist Sinclair Lewis was known for his satirical stories such as Babbitt  Main Street  and It Can t Happen Here  His books often explored and satirized contemporary American values  The film Dr  Strangelove from 1964 was a popular satire on the Cold War  A more humorous brand of satire enjoyed a renaissance in the UK in the early 1960s with the Satire Boom  led by such luminaries as Peter Cook  Alan Bennett  Jonathan Miller  and Dudley Moore  whose stage show Beyond the Fringe was a hit not only in Britain  but also in the United States  Other significant influences in 1960s British satire include David Frost  Eleanor Bron and the television program That Was The Week That Was  Paul Krassner s magazine The Realist was immensely popular during the 1960s and early 1970s among people in the counterculture and had articles and cartoons that were savage  biting satires of politicians such as Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon  the Vietnam War  the Cold War and the War on Drugs   edit  Contemporary satire Contemporary popular usage of the term  satire  is often very imprecise  While satire often uses caricature and parody  by no means are all uses of these or other humorous devices  satiric  Refer to the careful definition of satire that heads this article  Stephen Colbert satirically impersonates an opinionated and self righteous television commentator on his Comedy Central program in the United States  Stephen Colbert s television program  The Colbert Report  is instructive in the methods of contemporary American satire  Colbert s character is an opinionated and self righteous commentator who  in his TV interviews  interrupts people  points and wags his finger at them  and  unwittingly  uses a number of logical fallacies  In doing so  he demonstrates the principle of modern American political satire  the ridicule of the actions of politicians and other public figures by taking all their statements and purported beliefs to their furthest  supposedly  logical conclusion  thus revealing their perceived hypocrisy  Other political satire includes various political causes in the past  including the relatively successful Polish Beer Lovers  Party and the joke political candidates Molly the Dog 55  and Brian Miner  56  The television program South Park relies almost exclusively on satire to address issues in American culture  with episodes addressing anti Semitism  militant atheism  homophobia  environmentalism  corporate culture  political correctness and Catholic sex scandals  among many other issues  In the United Kingdom  a popular modern satirist is Sir Terry Pratchett  author of the internationally best selling Discworld book series  One of the most well known and controversial British satirists is Chris Morris  co writer and director of Four Lions  Satire is used on many UK television programmes  particularly popular panel shows and quiz shows such as Mock the Week  Have I Got News for You  and The Now Show  Similarly it is found on radio quiz shows such as The News Quiz  In Canada  satire has become an important part of the comedy scene  Stephen Leacock was one of the best known early Canadian satirists  and in the early 20th century  he achieved fame by targeting the attitudes of small town life  In more recent years  Canada has had several prominent satirical television series  Some  including CODCO  The Royal Canadian Air Farce  and This Hour Has 22 Minutes deal directly with current news stories and political figures  while others  like History Bites present contemporary social satire in the context of events and figures in history  The Canadian website The Daily Week combines social and political satire with absurdity  Canadian songwriter Nancy White uses music as the vehicle for her satire  and her comic folk songs are regularly played on CBC Radio  Cartoonists often use satire as well as straight humour  Al Capp s satirical comic strip Li l Abner was censored in September 1947  The controversy  as reported in Time  centred around Capp s portrayal of the US Senate  Said Edward Leech of Scripps Howard   We don t think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks    boobs and undesirables    57 Walt Kelly s Pogo was likewise censored in 1952 over his overt satire of Senator Joe McCarthy  caricatured in his comic strip as  Simple J  Malarky   Garry Trudeau  whose comic strip Doonesbury has charted and recorded many American follies for the last generation  deals with story lines such as the Vietnam War  and now  the Iraq War   dumbed down education  and over eating at  McFriendly s   Trudeau exemplifies humour mixed with criticism  Recently  one of his gay characters lamented that because he was not legally married to his partner  he was deprived of the  exquisite agony  of experiencing a nasty and painful divorce like heterosexuals  This  of course  satirized the claim that gay unions would denigrate the sanctity of heterosexual marriage  Doonesbury also presents an example of how satire can cause social change  The comic strip satirized a Florida county that had a law requiring minorities to have a passcard in the area  the law was soon repealed with an act nicknamed the Doonesbury Act  58  Like some literary predecessors  many recent television satires contain strong elements of parody and caricature  for instance  the popular animated series The Simpsons and South Park both parody modern family and social life by taking their assumptions to the extreme  both have led to the creation of similar series  As well as the purely humorous effect of this sort of thing  they often strongly criticise various phenomena in politics  economic life  religion and many other aspects of society  and thus qualify as satirical  Due to their animated nature  these shows can easily use images of public figures and generally have greater freedom to do so than conventional shows using live actors  Fake News is also a very popular form of contemporary satire  appearing in as wide an array of formats as the news media itself  print  e g  The Onion  Private Eye   radio  e g  On the Hour   television  e g  The Day Today  The Daily Show  Brass Eye  and the web  e g  Mindry in  Scunt News  59 Faking News  The Giant Napkin  60  Unconfirmed Sources 61  and The Onion s website   Other satires are on the list of satirists and satires  Another internet driven form of satire is to lampoon bad internet performers  An example of this is the Internet meme character Miranda Sings  62  63  In an interview with Wikinews  Sean Mills  President of The Onion  said angry letters about their news parody always carried the same message   It s whatever affects that person   said Mills   So it s like   I love it when you make a joke about murder or rape  but if you talk about cancer  well my brother has cancer and that s not funny to me   Or someone else can say   Cancer s hilarious  but don t talk about rape because my cousin got raped   Those are rather extreme examples  but if it affects somebody personally  they tend to be more sensitive about it   64  Zhou Libo  a comedian from Shanghai  is the most popular satirist in China  His humour has interested the middle class people and had sold out shows ever since his rise to fame  Primarily a theater performer  Zhou said his work is never scripted  allowing him to improvise jokes about recent events  He often mocks political figures he supports  citation needed   edit  Perception of satire Because satire often combines anger and humour it can be profoundly disturbing   because it is essentially ironic or sarcastic  it is often misunderstood  Common uncomprehending responses to satire include revulsion  accusations of poor taste  or that  it s just not funny  for instance   to the idea that the satirist actually does support the ideas  policies  or people he is attacking  For instance  at the time of its publication  many people misunderstood Swift s purpose in A Modest Proposal  assuming it to be a serious recommendation of economically motivated cannibalism  Again  some critics of Mark Twain see Huckleberry Finn as racist and offensive  missing the point that its author clearly intended it to be satire  racism being in fact only one of a number of Mark Twain s known concerns attacked in Huckleberry Finn   65  66  This same misconception was suffered by the main character of the 1960s British television comedy satire Till Death Us Do Part  The character of Alf Garnett  played by Warren Mitchell  was created to poke fun at the kind of narrow minded  racist  little Englander that Garnett represented  Instead  his character became a sort of anti hero to people who actually agreed with his views  The same thing happened with conservative Americans in regard to the main character in the American TV Show All in the Family  Archie Bunker  The Australian satirical television comedy show The Chaser s War on Everything has suffered repeated attacks based on various perceived interpretations of the  target  of its attacks  The  Make a Realistic Wish Foundation  sketch  June 2009   which attacked in classical satiric fashion the heartlessness of people who are reluctant to donate to charities  was widely interpreted as an attack on the Make a Wish Foundation  or even the terminally ill children helped by that organisation  Prime Minister of the time Kevin Rudd stated that The Chaser team  should hang their heads in shame   He went on to say that  I didn t see that but it s been described to me    But having a go at kids with a terminal illness is really beyond the pale  absolutely beyond the pale   67  Television station management suspended the show for two weeks and reduced the third season to eight episodes   edit  Satire under fire Satire on internet culture  Because satire criticises in an ironic  essentially indirect way  it frequently escapes censorship in a way more direct criticism might not  Periodically  however  it runs into serious opposition  and people in power who perceive themselves as attacked attempt to censor it or prosecute its practitioners  In a very early instance of this  Aristophanes was persecuted by the demagogue Cleon  In 1599  the Archbishop of Canterbury John Whitgift and the Bishop of London George Abbot  whose offices had the function of licensing books for publication in England  issued a decree banning verse satire  The decree ordered the burning of certain volumes of satire by John Marston  Thomas Middleton  Joseph Hall  and others  it also required histories and plays to be specially approved by a member of the Queen s Privy Council  and it prohibited the future printing of satire in verse  68  The motives for the ban are obscure  particularly since some of the books banned had been licensed by the same authorities less than a year earlier  Various scholars have argued that the target was obscenity  libel  or sedition  It seems likely that lingering anxiety about the Martin Marprelate controversy  in which the bishops themselves had employed satirists  played a role  both Thomas Nashe and Gabriel Harvey  two of the key figures in that controversy  suffered a complete ban on all their works  In the event  though  the ban was little enforced  even by the licensing authority itself  In 2005  the Jyllands Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy caused global protests by offended Muslims and violent attacks with many fatalities in the Near East  It was not the first case of Muslim protests against criticism in the form of satire  but the Western world was surprised by the hostility of the reaction  Any country s flag in which a newspaper chose to publish the parodies was being burnt in a Near East country  then embassies were attacked  killing 139 people in mainly four countries  see article   politicians throughout Europe agreed that satire was an aspect of the freedom of speech  and therefore to be a protected means of dialogue  Iran threatened to start an International Holocaust Cartoon Competition  which was immediately responded to by Jews with an Israeli Anti Semitic Cartoons Contest  In 2006 British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen released Borat  Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan  a  mockumentary  that satirized everyone  from high society to frat boys  Criticism of the film was heavy  from claims of antisemitism  despite the fact Cohen is Jewish  to the massive boycott of the film by the Kazakh government  the film itself had been a reaction to a longer quarrel between the government and the comedian  In 2008  popular South African cartoonist and satirist Jonathan Shapiro  who is published under the pen name Zapiro  came under fire for depicting then president of the ANC Jacob Zuma in the act of undressing in preparation for the implied rape of  Lady Justice  which is held down by Zuma loyalists  69  The cartoon was drawn in response to Zuma s efforts to duck corruption charges  and the controversy was heightened by the fact that Zuma was himself acquitted of rape in May 2006  In February 2009  the South African Broadcasting Corporation  viewed by some opposition parties as the mouthpiece of the governing ANC  70  shelved a satirical TV show created by Shapiro  71  and in May 2009 the broadcaster pulled a documentary about political satire  featuring Shapiro among others  for the second time  hours before scheduled broadcast  72 Apartheid South Africa also had a long history of censorship  On December 29  2009  Samsung sued Mike Breen  and the Korea Times for  1 million  claiming criminal defamation over a satirical column published on Christmas Day  2009  73  74   edit  Satirical prophecy Satire is occasionally prophetic  the jokes precede actual events  75  76  Among the eminent examples are  The 1784 presaging of modern daylight saving time  later actually proposed in 1907  While an American envoy to France  Benjamin Franklin anonymously published a letter in 1784 suggesting that Parisians economize on candles by arising earlier to use morning sunlight  77  In the 1920s an English cartoonist imagined a very laughable thing for that time  a hotel for cars  He drew a multi story car park  76  The second episode of Monty Python s Flying Circus  which debuted in 1969  featured a skit entitled  The Mouse Problem   meant to satirize contemporary media expos s on homosexuality   which depicted a cultural phenomenon eerily similar to modern furry fandom  which did not become widespread until the 1980s  over a decade after the skit was first aired  The comedy film  Americathon   released in 1979 and set in the United States of 1998  predicted a number of trends and events that would eventually unfold in the near future  including an American debt crisis  Chinese capitalism  the fall of the Soviet Union  terrorism aimed at the civilian population  a presidential sex scandal  corporate takeover of the government  and the popularity of reality shows  In January 2001  a satirical news article in The Onion  entitled  Our Long National Nightmare of Peace and Prosperity Is Finally Over  78  had newly elected President George Bush vowing to  develop new and expensive weapons technologies  and to  engage in at least one Gulf War level armed conflict in the next four years   Furthermore he would  bring back economic stagnation by implementing substantial tax cuts  which would lead to a recession   However  the article predicted the  deregulation of     industries  and the defunding of     social service programs   which turned out to be erroneous  as the Administration dramatically increased such spending  including under a trillion dollar prescription drug program  In 1975  the first episode of Saturday Night Live included an ad for a triple blade razor called the Triple Trac  in 2001  Gillette introduced the Mach3  In 2004  The Onion satirized Schick and Gillette s marketing of ever increasingly multi blade razors with a mock article proclaiming Gillette will now introduce a five blade razor  79  In 2006  Gillette released the Gillette Fusion  a five blade razor   edit  See also Look up satire in Wiktionary  the free dictionary  List of satirists and satires News satire

Jo Coppola  1958  The Realist  Issue 1  quotation  Good comedy is social criticism although you might find that hard to believe if all you ever saw were some of the so called clowns of videoland     Comedy is dying today because criticism is on its deathbed     because telecasters  frightened by the threats and pressure of sponsors  blacklists and viewers  helped introduce conformity to this age    In such a climate  comedy cannot flourish  For comedy is  after all  a look at ourselves  not as we pretend to be when we look in the mirror of our imagination  but as we really are  Look at the
