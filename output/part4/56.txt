7851 4857 9 X Force is a fictional Marvel Comics superhero team  one of several spin offs of the popular X Men franchise  Conceived by writer illustrator Rob Liefeld  the team was formed in New Mutants  vol  1  100  April 1991  and soon afterwards was featured in its own series  The group was a new incarnation of the 1980s team  the New Mutants  Led by the mutant Cable  X Force was more militant and aggressive than the X Men  X Force was successful in the early 1990s  The series  popularity waned after Liefeld left  causing Marvel to implement several reforms in the title from 1995 until 2001 with varying degrees of success  Low sales on the series prompted Marvel to revamp the title in 2001 with a new cast in the form of a group of self interested young mutants who were gathered together by a corporation to become media stars and used the name X Force  X Force  vol  1 was canceled with  129 and relaunched as X Statix  which featured the later incarnation of the team  After X Statix was canceled with  26  Marvel reunited the original X Force team for a six issue 2004 miniseries plotted and drawn by Liefeld  In 2007 2008  during the Messiah Complex crossover  a new version of X Force was formed that had Wolverine leading a more militaristic black ops branch of the X Men  forming the basis for a new X Force series starting February 2008 by writers Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost  plus Clayton Crain as the artist  The series came to a conclusion in September 2010 as part of the Second Coming storyline that ran through various X titles  The title was then relaunched in October 2010 as Uncanny X Force with Rick Remender and Jerome Ope a as the creative team and Wolverine  Psylocke  Deadpool  Archangel  Fantomex  and E V A  as the initial roster  1

it or discuss these issues on the talk page  It may need to be rewritten entirely to comply with Wikipedia s quality standards  Tagged since December 2011  Its plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed  Tagged since December 2011   edit  Liefeld period X Force was created by illustrator Rob Liefeld after he started penciling the New Mutants  vol  1 comic book in 1989 with  86  The popularity of Liefeld s art led to him taking over the writing and drawing duties on the book  which allowed him to introduce Cable and several other new hard edged characters in 1990 and 1991  With help from writer Fabian Nicieza  who provided the dialogue for Liefeld s plots  Liefeld transformed the New Mutants into X Force in New Mutants  vol  1  100  the book s final issue  Liefeld and Nicieza launched X Force  vol  1 in August 1991  Rob Liefeld obtained the name for the series from an unknown artist at a convention a few months prior to its release  With the aid of a multiple variant poly bagged card  the book sold a record 5 million copies  and remains the second highest selling American comic book of all time  surpassed only by Jim Lee s X Men book that same summer with 8 million copies  The original line up of the team included Boom Boom  Cable  Cannonball  Domino  Feral  Shatterstar and Warpath  In later issues  X Force s roster would include Siryn  Rictor and Sunspot  The main opponents of X Force during its first year were the terrorist Mutant Liberation Front  led by Stryfe  a masked mutant with a mysterious link to Cable  Early issues also featured the wise cracking mercenary Deadpool  the immortal Externals  and a new version of the Brotherhood of Mutants  Propelled by Liefeld s art  X Force became one of Marvel s bestselling comic books immediately after its debut  The series rivaled The Amazing Spider Man and Uncanny X Men in popularity  particularly with the adolescent demographic  citation needed Toy Biz responded to X Force s popularity by introducing an X Force action figure line alongside its X Men action figure line  Liefeld illustrated the series up to  9 and stopped plotting it after  12 as Liefeld had become increasingly frustrated that he did not own the characters he created and that his art was being used on a variety of merchandise while he received little royalties  Along with six other popular Marvel artists  Liefeld left Marvel Comics in 1992 to form Image Comics   edit  Mid 1990s  Nicieza and Loeb X Force continued with Nicieza writing and Greg Capullo illustrating  Nicieza  who also wrote X Men  vol  2  helped plot the X Cutioner s Song storyline that overlapped into most X Men related books in the fall of 1992  In that story  Stryfe frames Cable for an assassination attempt on the X Men s founder Professor X  leading to a clash between the X Men and X Force  The crossover boosted Cable s popularity  despite the character s apparent death in X Force  18  leading to his own solo series being launched in 1993  After X Cutioner s Song  X Force continued under Nicieza and Capullo  and later pencilled by Tony Daniel  Having temporarily lost their leader  X Force attempted to develop an identity of their own  The team gradually developed into a dysfunctional family after Cable s return in  25  and the title regularly combined soap opera plot threads  such as romance and Siryn s alcoholism  with violent action  Nicieza fleshed out previously unknown elements of each character s history  including Siryn s family in Ireland  2  Rictor s in Mexico  3  and Cannonball s in Kentucky  4  as well as the mysterious origins of Shatterstar  5  This period also saw the reintroduction of characters from the group s New Mutants days  such as Rusty and Skids  6 Danielle Moonstar  7  and Cypher and Wolfsbane  8  A long simmering sub plot about Reignfire and the disappearance of Sunspot came to a climax just as the book went on hiatus for the Age of Apocalypse crossover event in 1995  Due to falling sales  citation needed X Force emerged from the Age of Apocalypse event with a new creative team of writer Jeph Loeb and illustrator Adam Pollina  who significantly revised the team with issue  44  Loeb introduced new team uniforms  had the team move in with the X Men at the X Mansion  and placed emphasis on character driven stories with fewer fight scenes  Rictor quit the team and Cannonball joined the X Men  Caliban  a super strong albino mutant who possessed the mind of a child  joined the team  Loeb s stories included revelations about Shatterstar s origin and the transformation of Boomer  formerly Boom Boom  into the more aggressive Meltdown  Fan response was generally positive  citation needed   edit  Post Cable period In 1997  writer John Francis Moore  portrayed the team as carefree walkers exploring the open road and had X Force break away from Cable and the X Men  The roster of that incarnation was Meltdown  Siryn  Sunspot  Warpath  and Danielle Moonstar  In 1998  Moore and new artist Jim Cheung had X Force move to a new headquarters in San Francisco  returned Cannonball and later Domino to the team  and added Bedlam  a mutant who could disrupt electronic equipment  However  towards the end of this run  sales on the title began to fall drastically  citation needed  Writer Warren Ellis  who was known for his dark  cynical style  revamped three books   X Force  Generation X  and X Man   as part of the Revolution revamp of the X Men series of titles in 2000  Ellis  stint on X Force  co written by Ian Edginton and illustrated by Whilce Portacio  saw Bedlam  Cannonball  Meltdown  and Warpath become a covert ops superhero team under the leadership of Pete Wisdom  a British mutant and former intelligence agent who could shoot burning blades of energy from his fingers  Sales remained about the same despite the changes in creators  9   edit  Cancellation and replacement In early 2001  X Force was completely reimagined by writer Peter Milligan and artist Mike Allred  who replaced the existing incarnation of the team with an entirely different group of mutants using the X Force name  In X Force  vol  1  115  Bedlam  Cannonball  Meltdown  and Warpath all appeared to die in an explosion  though all subsequently returned  The next issue   116  saw the introduction of a new  sardonically toned X Force consisting of colorfully dressed and emotionally immature young mutants put together and marketed to be media superstars  X Force was canceled with  129 in late 2002 and replaced with the retitled X Statix series in late 2002  In 2004  Marvel released a new six issue X Force miniseries  once again plotted and illustrated by Liefeld  with dialogue by Nicieza  that gathered many of the characters featured in the first X Force  to critical panning yet decent sales  citation needed  Some controversy arose from Liefeld s insertion of over ten pages from previous unpublished comic books  Weapon X and Cable  First Contact  with word balloons edited to make them fit the X Force storyline  citation needed  It was subsequently followed with a four issue prequel X Force  Shatterstar miniseries   edit  Volume 3

lethal force to permanently deal with threats against mutants  Warpath  Wolfsbane  Wolverine and X 23 form the starting lineup  with Angel  Domino and Elixir joining soon after  Yost had at one point

warehouse  barely alive  Angel retrieves Elixir to heal Rahne  who wakes up soon after  Laura then catches the scent of Elixir s and Angel s blood  and runs off to help them  She reaches the room just

the Vanisher as their next target  It is revealed that Scalphunter  a former Marauder  contacted Cyclops about a break in at an old lab of Mister Sinister that held an altered version of the Legacy

the cloned Marauders inside  Domino retrieves the virus  only to be confronted by The Right s shocktroopers  who have come to take the virus for themselves  X 23 is injected with the virus while doing battle  and runs toward a nearby molten vat to destroy herself  thus destroying the virus   Elixir catches Laura as she jumps  and uses his healing powers to purge her of the virus  declaring that his purpose in X Force is to ensure no more of his friends will die  With Vanisher in tow  X Force returns home  11  Meanwhile  Warpath returns to his tribe s reservation at Camp Verde to visit his brother s grave  but discovers the empty graves of his entire tribe before being violently attacked by the Demon Bear  Just as he s about to be killed  Warpath is saved by Ghost Rider  who offers to teach him how to kill a demon  After engaging the Demon Bear in battle once more  Ghost Rider realizes the demon is reacting to pain caused by a dagger embedded in its body  Once Warpath removes the

responsible for digging up the graves of his tribe  Eli Bard  Warpath returns home and tells X Force what the spirits showed him  which ends with the revelation that Eli is using the Technarch
