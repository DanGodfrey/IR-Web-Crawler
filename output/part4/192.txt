Soldiers and crowds in Downtown Miami 20 minutes after surrender during World War II  1945  Archaeological research indicates that Florida was first inhabited by Paleo Indians  the first human inhabitants of the Americas  perhaps as early as 14 thousand years ago  The region was continuously inhabited through the Archaic period  to about 2000 BC   After about 500 BC the previously relatively uniform Archaic culture began to coalesce into distinctive local cultures  9  By the 16th century  the earliest time for which there is a historical record  major Native American groups included the Apalachee  of the Florida Panhandle   the Timucua  of northern and central Florida   the Ais  of the central Atlantic coast   the Tocobaga  of the Tampa Bay area   the Calusa  of southwest Florida  and the Tequesta  of the southeastern coast   Florida was the first part of what is now the continental United States to be visited by Europeans  The earliest known European explorers came with the Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de Le n  who spotted the peninsula on April 2  1513  According to his chroniclers  Ponce de Le n named the region La Florida   flowery land   because it was then the Easter Season  known in Spanish as Pascua Florida  roughly  Flowery Easter    and because the vegetation was in bloom  10  It is possible Juan Ponce de Le n was not the first European to reach Florida  however  reportedly  at least one indigenous tribesman whom he encountered in Florida in 1513 spoke Spanish  11  From 1513 onward  the land became known as  La Florida   although after 1630 and throughout the 18th century  Tegesta  after the Tequesta tribe  was an alternate name of choice for the Florida peninsula following publication of a map by the Dutch cartographer Hessel Gerritsz in Joannes de Laet s History of the New World  12  13  Over the following century  both the Spanish and French established settlements in Florida with varying degrees of success  In 1559  Don Trist n de Luna y Arellano established a colony at present day Pensacola  one of the first European attempts at settlement in the continental United States  It was abandoned by 1561 due to hurricanes  famine and warring tribes  and the area was not re inhabited until the 1690s  French Protestant Huguenots founded Fort Caroline in modern day Jacksonville in 1564  The following year  the Spanish colony of St  Augustine  San Agust n  was established  and forces from there conquered Fort Caroline that same year  The Spanish maintained tenuous control over the region by converting the local tribes  briefly with Jesuits and later with Franciscan friars  The area of Spanish Florida diminished with the establishment of English colonies to the north and French colonies to the west  The English weakened Spanish power in the area by supplying their Creek and Yamasee allies with firearms and urging them to raid the Timucuan and Apalachee client tribes of the Spanish  The English attacked St  Augustine  burning the city and its cathedral to the ground several times  while the citizens hid behind the walls of the Castillo de San Marcos  Florida was attracting a large number of Africans and African Americans from British occupied North America who sought freedom from slavery  Once in Florida  the Spanish Crown converted them to Roman Catholicism and gave them freedom  Those ex slaves settled in a community north of St  Augustine  called Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose  the first freedom settlement of its kind in what became the United States  Many of those slaves were also welcomed by Creek and Seminole Native Americans who had established settlements there at the invitation of the Spanish government  Great Britain gained control of Florida and other territory diplomatically in 1763 through the Peace of Paris  The British divided their new acquisitions into East Florida  with its capital at St  Augustine  and West Florida  with its capital at Pensacola  Britain tried to develop the Floridas through the importation of immigrants for labor  but this project ultimately failed  Spain received both Floridas after Britain s defeat by the American colonies and the subsequent Treaty of Versailles in 1783  continuing the division into East and West Florida  They offered land grants to anyone who settled in the colonies  and many Americans moved to them  After settler attacks on Indian towns  Seminole Indians based in East Florida began raiding Georgia settlements  purportedly at the behest of the Spanish  The United States Army led increasingly frequent incursions into Spanish territory  including the 1817 1818 campaign against the Seminole Indians by Andrew Jackson that became known as the First Seminole War  Following the war  the United States effectively controlled East Florida  In 1819  by terms of the Adams On s Treaty  Spain ceded Florida to the United States in exchange for the American renunciation of any claims on Texas that they might have from the Louisiana Purchase and  5 million  In 1830  the Indian Removal Act was passed and as settlement increased  pressure grew on the United States government to remove the Indians from their lands in Florida  To the chagrin of Georgia landowners  the Seminoles harbored and integrated runaway blacks  known as the Black Seminoles  and clashes between whites and Indians grew with the influx of new settlers  In 1832  the United States government signed the Treaty of Payne s Landing with some of the Seminole chiefs  promising them lands west of the Mississippi River if they agreed to leave Florida voluntarily  Many of the Seminoles left at this time  while those who remained prepared to defend their claims to the land  The U S  Army arrived in 1835 to enforce the treaty under pressure from white settlers  and the Second Seminole War began at the end of the year with the Dade Massacre  when Seminoles ambushed and killed or mortally wounded all but one in a group of 110 Army troops  plus Major Dade and seven officers  marching from Fort Brooke  Tampa  to reinforce Fort King  Ocala   14  Between 900 and 1 500 Seminole Indian warriors employed guerrilla tactics against United States Army troops for seven years until 1842  The U S  government is estimated to have spent between  20 million and  40 million on the war  at the time an astronomical sum  The United States quarter dollar coin released March 29  2004  in honor of the state of Florida  On March 3  1845  Florida became the 27th state of the United States of America  although initially its population grew slowly  White settlers continued to encroach on lands used by the Seminoles  and the United States government resolved to make another effort to move the remaining Seminoles to the West  The Third Seminole War lasted from 1855 to 1858  and resulted in the removal of most of the remaining Seminoles  Even after three bloody wars  the U S  Army failed to force all of the Seminole Indians in Florida to the West  15  Though most of the Seminoles were forcibly exiled to Creek lands west of the Mississippi  hundreds  including Seminole leader Aripeka  Sam Jones   remained in the Everglades and refused to leave the native homeland of their ancestors  Their descendants remain there to this day  White settlers began to establish cotton plantations in Florida  which required numerous laborers  By 1860 Florida had only 140 424 people  of whom 44  were enslaved  There were fewer than 1000 free African Americans before the Civil War  16  On January 10  1861  before the start of the American Civil War  Florida declared its secession from the Union  ten days later  the state became a founding member of the Confederate States of America  The war ended in 1865  On June 25  1868  Florida s congressional representation was restored  After Reconstruction  white Democrats succeeded in regaining power in the state legislature  In 1885 they created a new constitution  followed by statutes through 1889 that effectively disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites over the next several years  Provisions included poll taxes  literacy tests  and residency requirements  Disfranchisement for most African Americans in the state persisted until the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s gained federal legislation to protect their suffrage  Until the mid 20th century  Florida was the least populous Southern state  In 1900 its population was only 528 542  of whom nearly 44  were African American  17  The boll weevil devastated cotton crops  and early 20th century lynchings and racial violence caused a record number of African Americans to leave the state in the Great Migration to northern and midwestern industrial cities  Forty thousand blacks  roughly one fifth of their 1900 population  left for better opportunities  18  National economic prosperity in the 1920s stimulated tourism to Florida  Combined with its sudden elevation in profile was the Florida land boom of the 1920s  which brought a brief period of intense land development  Devastating hurricanes in 1926 and 1928  followed by the stock market crash and Great Depression  brought that period to a halt  Florida s economy did not fully recover until the buildup for World War II  The climate  tempered by the growing availability of air conditioning  and low cost of living made the state a haven  Migration from the Rust Belt and the Northeast sharply increased the population after the war  In recent decades  more migrants have come for the jobs in a developing economy  With a population of more than 18 million according to the 2010 census  Florida is the most populous state in the Southeastern United States  the second most populous state in the South behind Texas  and the fourth most populous in the United States  St  Augustine is the oldest city in the United States  established in 1565 by Spain Key West Historic District Historic Ybor City

and boundaries Main article  Geography of Florida See also  List of counties in Florida and List of Florida state parks Much of the state of Florida is situated on a peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico  the Atlantic Ocean and the Straits of Florida  Spanning two time zones  it extends to the northwest into a panhandle  extending along the northern Gulf of Mexico  It is bordered on the north by the states of Georgia and Alabama  and on the west  at the end of the panhandle  by Alabama  It is near several Caribbean countries  particularly The Bahamas and Cuba  Florida is one of the largest states east of the Mississippi River  and only Alaska and Michigan are larger in water area  At 345 feet  105 m  above mean sea level  Britton Hill is the highest point in Florida and the lowest highpoint of any U S  state  19  Much of the state south of Orlando is low lying and fairly level  however  some places  such as Clearwater  feature vistas that rise 50 to 100 feet  15   30 m  above the water  Much of Central and North Florida  typically 25 miles  40 km  or more away from the coastline  features rolling hills with elevations ranging from 100 to 250 feet  30   76 m   The highest point in peninsular Florida  Sugarloaf Mountain  is a 312 foot  95 m  peak in Lake County  20   edit  Boundaries The state line begins in the Atlantic Ocean  traveling west  south  and north up the thalweg of the Saint Mary s River  At the origin of that river  it then follows a straight line nearly due west and slightly north  to the point where the confluence of the Flint River  from Georgia  and the Chattahoochee River  down the Alabama Georgia line  used to form Florida s Apalachicola River   Since Woodruff Dam was built  this point has been under Lake Seminole   The border with Georgia continues north through the lake for a short distance up the former thalweg of the Chattahoochee  then with Alabama runs due west along latitude 31 N to the Perdido River  then south along its thalweg to the Gulf via Perdido Bay  The water boundary is 3 nautical miles  3 5 mi  5 6 km  offshore in the Atlantic Ocean 21  and 9 nautical miles  10 mi  17 km  offshore in the Gulf of Mexico  21  Much of the state is at or near sea level   edit  Climate Main article  Climate of Florida See also  List of Florida hurricanes and List of all time high and low temperatures by state Hurricane Andrew bearing down on Florida on August 23  1992  The climate of Florida is tempered somewhat by the fact that no part of the state is very distant from the ocean  North of Lake Okeechobee  the prevalent climate is humid subtropical  K ppen  Cfa   while coastal areas south of the lake  including the Florida Keys  have a true tropical climate  K ppen  Aw   22  Mean high temperatures for late July are primarily in the low 90s Fahrenheit  32 34  C   Mean low temperatures for early to mid January range from the low 40s Fahrenheit  4 7  C  in northern Florida to the mid 50s   13  C  in southern Florida  With an average daily temperature of 70 7  F  21 5  C   it is the warmest state in the country  23  In the summer  high temperatures in the state seldom exceed 100  F  38  C   Several record cold maxima have been in the 30s  F   1 to 4  C  and record lows have been in the 10s   12 to  7  C   These temperatures normally extend at most a few days at a time in the northern and central parts of Florida  Southern Florida  however  rarely encounters freezing temperatures  The hottest temperature ever recorded in Florida was 109  F  43  C   which was set on June 29  1931 in Monticello  The coldest temperature was  2  F   19  C   on February 13  1899  just 25 miles  40 km  away  in Tallahassee  Due to the tropical climate Florida rarely receives snow  However  on very rare occasions  a combination of cold moisture and freezing temperatures can result in snowfall  Frost is more common than snow  occuring several times during the winter months  Snowball fight on the Florida State Capitol Building in Tallahassee on February 13  1899 The USDA Plant hardiness zones for the state range from zone 8a  no colder than 10  F   12  C   in the inland western panhandle to zone 11  no colder than 40  F  4  C   in the lower Florida Keys  24  Florida s nickname is the  Sunshine State   but severe weather is a common occurrence in the state  Central Florida is known as the lightning capital of the United States  as it experiences more lightning strikes than anywhere else in the country   25  Florida has the highest average precipitation of any state  citation needed  in large part because afternoon thunderstorms are common in most of the state from late spring until early autumn  A narrow eastern part of the state including Orlando and Jacksonville receives between 2 400 and 2 800 hours of sunshine annually  The rest of the state  including Miami  receives between 2 800 and 3 200 hours annually  26  Florida leads the United States in tornadoes per square mile  when including waterspouts  27  but they do not typically reach the intensity of those in the Midwest and Great Plains  Hail often accompanies the most severe thunderstorms  Hurricanes pose a severe threat during hurricane season  which lasts from June 1 to November 30  although some storms have been known to form out of season  Florida is the most hurricane prone US state  with subtropical or tropical water on a lengthy coastline  From 1851 to 2006  Florida has been struck by 114 hurricanes  37 of them major category 3 and above  28  It is rare for a hurricane season to pass without any impact in the state by at least a tropical storm  For storms  category 4 or higher  83  have either hit Florida or Texas  28  August to October is the most likely period for a hurricane in Florida  In 2004  Florida was hit by a record four hurricanes  Hurricanes Charley  August 13   Frances  September 4 5   Ivan  September 16   and Jeanne  September 25 26  cumulatively cost the state s economy  42 billion  Additionally  the four storms caused an estimated  45 billion in damage   29  In 2005  Hurricane Dennis  July 10  became the fifth storm to strike Florida within eleven months  Later  Hurricane Katrina  August 25  passed through South Florida and Hurricane Rita  September 20  swept through the Florida Keys  Hurricane Wilma  October 24  made landfall near Cape Romano  just south of Marco Island  finishing another very active hurricane season  Wilma is the second most expensive hurricane in Florida history  due in part to a five year window in which to file claims  30  Florida was the site of the second costliest weather disaster in U S  history  Hurricane Andrew  which caused more than US 25 billion in damage when it struck on August 24  1992  In a long list of other infamous hurricane strikes are the 1926 Miami hurricane  the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane  the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935  Hurricane Donna in 1960  and Hurricane Opal in 1995  Recent research suggests the storms are part of a natural cycle and not a result of global warming  31  32  Average High and Low temperatures for various Florida Cities City Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec

population has risen from a historic low of 300 in the 1970s  to 3 000 in 2011  42  Since their accidental importation from South America into North America in the 1930s  the Red imported fire ant population has increased its territorial range to include most of the Southern United States  including Florida  They are more aggressive than most native ant species and have a painful sting  43  A number of non native snakes and lizards have been released in the wild  In 2010 the state created a hunting season for Burmese and Indian pythons  African rock pythons  green anacondas  and Nile

Florida is a low per capita energy user  45  It is estimated that approximately 4  of energy in the state is generated through renewable resources  46  Florida s energy production is 6  of the nation s total energy output  while total production of pollutants is lower  with figures of 5 6  for nitrogen oxide  5 1  for carbon dioxide  and 3 5  for sulfur dioxide  46  It is believed that significant petroleum resources are located off Florida s western coast in the Gulf of Mexico  but that region has been closed to exploration since 1981  47  Red tide has been an issue on the southwest coast of Florida  as well as other areas  While there has been a great deal of conjecture over the cause of the toxic algae bloom  there is no evidence that it is being caused by pollution or that there has been an increase in the duration or frequency of red tides  48  The Florida panther is close to extinction  A record 23 were killed in 2009 predominately by automobile collisions  leaving only about 100 individuals in the wild  The Center for Biological Diversity and others have therefore called for a special protected area for the panther to be established  49 Manatees are also dying at a rate higher than their reproduction  Prior to instituting controlled burns  the state forests and pastures burned for months during the dry season  From the 1940s to the 1970s  the state and federal government assumed control of burning that largely prevented uncontrolled fires  50  In 2010  the state burned a record 2 600 000 acres  11 000 km2   51   edit  Recycling The recycling rate in Florida is estimated at 28  in 2000  52  In 2008  The Energy  Climate Change  and Economic Security Act of 2008 set a goal of progressively improving recycling to reach a 75 percent rate by the year 2020  It directs public entities  schools  state and local public agencies  to report the amount they recycle annually to their counties  Private businesses are encouraged  but not mandated  to report the amount they recycle to their counties  Finally  the section directs DEP to create the Recycling Business Assistance Center  53  Under the new law  each county must implement a recyclable materials recycling program that shall have a goal of recycling recyclable solid waste by 40 percent by December 31  2012  50 percent by 2014  60 percent by 2016  70 percent by 2018  and 75 percent by 2020  54  The county with the highest recycling rate is Lee County with a 43  recycling rate as of 2008  55   edit  Geology Topographic map of Florida The Florida peninsula is a porous plateau of karst limestone sitting atop bedrock known as the Florida Platform  The emergent portion of the platform was created during the Eocene to Oligocene as the Gulf Trough filled with silts  clays  and sands  Flora and fauna began appearing during the Miocene  No land animals were present in Florida prior to the Miocene  The largest deposits of potash in the United States are found in Florida  56  Extended systems of underwater caves  sinkholes and springs are found throughout the state and supply most of the water used by residents  The limestone is topped with sandy soils deposited as ancient beaches over millions of years as global sea levels rose and fell  During the last glacial period  lower sea levels and a drier climate revealed a much wider peninsula  largely savanna  57  The Everglades  an enormously wide  very slow flowing river encompasses the southern tip of the peninsula  Sinkhole damage claims on property in the state exceeded a total of  2 billion from 2006 through 2010  58  Florida is tied for last place 59  as having the fewest earthquakes of any US state  60  Because Florida is not located near any tectonic plate boundaries  earthquakes are very rare  but not totally unknown  The 1755 Lisbon earthquake triggered a tsunami that would have struck Central Florida with an estimated 5 foot  1 5 m  wave  61  In January  1879  a shock of Mercalli intensity scale VI occurred near St  Augustine  There were reports of heavy shaking that knocked plaster from walls and articles from shelves  Similar effects were noted at Daytona Beach 50 miles  80 km  south  The

passed statutes with provisions to reduce voting by blacks and poor whites  which had threatened white Democratic power with a populist coalition  As these groups were stripped from voter rolls  white Democrats established power in a one party state  as happened across the South  In 1900 African Americans comprised 44  of the state s population  90  the same proportion as before the Civil War  but they were effectively disfranchised  From 1877 to 1948  Florida voted for the Democratic candidate for president in every election except for the 1928 election  The Florida Supreme Court In response to segregation  disfranchisement and agricultural depression  many African Americans migrated from Florida to northern cities in the Great Migration  in waves from 1910 1940  and again starting in the later 1940s  They moved for jobs  better education for their children and the chance to vote and participate in society  Given migration of other groups into Florida  as noted in other sections of

percentages of racial minorities  as well as transplanted white liberals coming primarily from the Northeastern United States  95  The South Florida metropolitan area was a good example of this as it had a particularly high level of both racial minorities and white liberals  Because of this  the area has been one of the most Democratic areas of the state  The Daytona Beach area has been  to a lesser extent  somewhat similar to South Florida demographically and the city of Orlando had a large Hispanic population  which often favored Democrats  Republicans remain dominant throughout much of the rest of Florida particularly in the more rural and suburban areas  as is the case throughout the Deep South  95  The fast growing I 4 corridor area  which runs through Central Florida and connects the cities of Daytona Beach  Orlando  and Tampa St  Petersburg  had a fairly similar number of both Republican and Democratic voters  The area is often seen as a merging point of the conservative northern portion of the state and the liberal southern portion making it the biggest swing area in the state  In recent times  whichever way the I 4 corridor area  containing 40  of Florida voters  votes has often determined who will win the state of Florida in presidential elections  96  The Democratic Party has maintained an edge in voter registration  both statewide and in 40 of the 67
