living above the store again   7  According to Paul Kengor  author of God and Ronald Reagan  Reagan had a particularly strong faith in the goodness of people  which stemmed from the optimistic faith of his mother  Nelle  8  and the Disciples of Christ faith  8  which he was baptized into in 1922  9  For the time  Reagan was unusual in his opposition to racial discrimination  and recalled a time in Dixon when the local inn would not allow black people to stay there  Reagan brought them back to his house  where his mother invited them to stay the night and have breakfast the next morning  10  Following the closure of the Pitney Store in late 1920  the Reagans moved to Dixon  11  the midwestern  small universe  had a lasting impression on Reagan  12  He attended Dixon High School  13  where

best movie  22  though the film was condemned by New York Times critic Bosley Crowther  23  24  Although  Reagan called Kings Row the film that  made me a star   25  he was unable to capitalize on his

know if it was exactly love at first sight  but it was pretty close   47  They were engaged at Chasen s restaurant in Los Angeles and were married on March 4  1952  at the Little Brown Church in the

didn t have you   51  When he was in the hospital in 1981  she slept with one of his shirts to be comforted by his scent  52  In a letter to U S  citizens written in 1994  Reagan wrote  I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer s disease     I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience   47  and in 1998  while Reagan was stricken by Alzheimer s  Nancy told Vanity Fair   Our relationship is very special  We were very much in love and still are  When I say my life began with Ronnie  well  it s true  It did  I can t imagine life without him   47  Early political career Reagan began his political career as a liberal Democrat  admirer of Franklin D  Roosevelt  and an active supporter of New Deal policies  In the early 1950s  as his relationship with Republican actress Nancy Davis grew  53  54  he shifted to the right and  while remaining a Democrat  endorsed the presidential candidacies of Dwight D  Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 as well as Richard Nixon in 1960  55  The last time Reagan actively supported a Democratic candidate was in 1950 when he helped Helen Gahagan Douglas in her unsuccessful Senate campaign against Richard Nixon  56  After being hired in 1954 to host the General Electric Theater  a TV drama series  57  Reagan soon began to embrace the conservative views of the sponsoring company s officials  57  58  His many GE speeches which he wrote himself were non partisan but carried a conservative  pro business message  he was influenced by Lemuel Boulware  a senior GE executive  Boulware  known for his tough stance against unions and his innovative strategies to win over workers  championed the core tenets of modern American conservatism  free markets  anticommunism  lower taxes  and limited government  59  Eventually  the ratings for Reagan s show fell off and GE dropped Reagan in 1962  60  In August of that year Reagan formally switched to the Republican Party  stating   I didn t leave the Democratic Party  The party left me   61  In the early 1960s Reagan opposed certain civil rights legislation  saying that  if an individual wants to discriminate against Negroes or others in selling or renting his house  it is his right to do so   62  In his rationale  he cited his opposition to government intrusion into personal freedoms  as opposed to racism  he strongly denied having racist motives and later reversed his opposition to voting rights and fair housing laws  63  When legislation that would become Medicare was introduced in 1961  Reagan created a recording for the American Medical Association warning that such legislation would mean the end of freedom in America  Reagan said that if his listeners did not write letters to prevent it   we will awake to find that we have so cialism  And if you don t do this  and if I don t do it  one of these days  you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children  and our children s children  what it once was like in America when men were free   64  65  66  He also joined the National Rifle Association and would become a lifetime member  67  Reagan endorsed the campaign of conservative presidential contender Barry Goldwater in 1964  Speaking for Goldwater  Reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government  He revealed his ideological motivation in a famed speech delivered on October 27  1964   The Founding Fathers knew a government can t control the economy without controlling people  And they knew when a government sets out to do that  it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose  So we have come to a time for choosing   68  He also said   You and I are told we must choose between a left or right  but I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right  There is only an up or down  Up to man s age old dream   the maximum of individual freedom consistent with order   or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism   68  69  This  A Time for Choosing  speech raised  1 million for Goldwater s campaign 16  and is considered the event that launched Reagan s political career  70  Governor of California  1967 1975 Main article  Governorship of Ronald Reagan Ronald and Nancy Reagan celebrate Reagan s gubernatorial victory at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles  California Republicans were impressed with Reagan s political views and charisma after his  Time for Choosing  speech  71  and nominated him for Governor of California in 1966  In Reagan s campaign  he emphasized two main themes   to send the welfare bums back to work   and  in reference to burgeoning anti war and anti establishment student protests at the University of California at Berkeley   to clean up the mess at Berkeley   72  He was elected  defeating two term governor Edmund G   Pat  Brown  and was sworn in on January 2  1967  In his first term  he froze government hiring and approved tax hikes to balance the budget  73  Shortly after the beginning of his term  Reagan tested the presidential waters in 1968 as part of a  Stop Nixon  movement  hoping to cut into Nixon s Southern support 74  and be a compromise candidate 75  if neither Nixon nor second place Nelson Rockefeller received enough delegates to win on the first ballot at the Republican convention  However  by the time of the convention Nixon had 692 delegate votes  25 more than he needed to secure the nomination  followed by Rockefeller with Reagan in third place  74  Reagan was involved in high profile conflicts with the protest movements of the era  On May 15  1969  during the People s Park protests at UC Berkeley  Reagan sent the California Highway Patrol and other officers to quell the protests  in an incident that became known as  Bloody Thursday   resulting in the death of student James Rector and the blinding of carpenter Alan Blanchard  76  77  Reagan then called out 2 200 state National Guard troops to occupy the city of Berkeley for two weeks in order to crack down on the protesters  76  A year after  Bloody Thursday   Reagan responded to questions about campus protest movements saying   If it takes a bloodbath  let s get it over with  No more appeasement   78  When the Symbionese Liberation Army kidnapped Patty Hearst in Berkeley and demanded the distribution of food to the poor  Reagan joked   It s just too bad we can t have an epidemic of botulism   79  The Reagans meeting with then President Richard Nixon and First Lady Pat Nixon in July 1970 Early in 1967  the national debate on abortion was beginning  Democratic California state senator Anthony Beilenson introduced the  Therapeutic Abortion Act   in an effort to reduce the number of  back room abortions  performed in California  76  The State Legislature sent the bill to Reagan s desk where  after many days of indecision  he signed it  80  About two million abortions would be performed as a result  most because of a provision in the bill allowing abortions for the well being of the mother  80  Reagan had been in office for only four months when he signed the bill  and stated that had he been more experienced as governor  it would not have been signed  After he recognized what he called the  consequences  of the bill  he announced that he was pro life  80  He maintained that position later in his political career  writing extensively about abortion  81  Despite an unsuccessful attempt to recall him in 1968  82  Reagan was re elected in 1970  defeating  Big Daddy  Jesse Unruh  He chose not to seek a third term in the following election cycle  One of Reagan s greatest frustrations in office concerned capital punishment  which he strongly supported  21  His efforts to enforce the state s laws in this area were thwarted when the Supreme Court of California issued its People v  Anderson decision  which invalidated all death sentences issued in California prior to 1972  though the decision was later overturned by a constitutional amendment  The only execution during Reagan s governorship was on April 12  1967  when Aaron Mitchell s sentence was carried out by the state in San Quentin s gas chamber  83  In 1969  Reagan  as Governor  signed the Family Law Act which was the first no fault divorce legislation in the United States  84  Reagan s terms as governor helped to shape the policies he would pursue in his later political career as president  By campaigning on a platform of sending  the welfare bums back to work   he spoke out against the idea of the welfare state  He also strongly advocated the Republican ideal of less government regulation of the economy  including that of undue federal taxation  85  Reagan did not seek re election to a third term as governor in 1974 and was succeeded by Democratic California Secretary of State Jerry Brown on January 6  1975  1976 presidential campaign Main article  Republican Party  United States  presidential primaries  1976 Ronald Reagan on the podium with Gerald Ford at the 1976 Republican National Convention after narrowly losing the presidential nomination  In 1976  Reagan challenged incumbent President Gerald Ford in a bid to become the Republican Party s candidate for president  Reagan soon established himself as the conservative candidate with the support of like minded organizations such as the American Conservative Union which became key components of his political base  while President Ford was considered a more moderate Republican  86  Reagan s campaign relied on a strategy crafted by campaign manager John Sears of winning a few primaries early to damage the inevitability of Ford s likely nomination  Reagan won North Carolina  Texas  and California  but the strategy failed  as 87  he ended up losing New Hampshire  Florida  and his native Illinois  88  The Texas campaign lent renewed hope to Reagan  when he swept all ninety six delegates chosen in the May 1 primary  with four more awaiting at the state convention  Much of the credit for that victory came from the work of three co chairmen  including Ernest Angelo  the mayor of Midland  and Ray Barnhart of Houston  whom President Reagan tapped in 1981 as director of the Federal Highway Administration  89  However  as the GOP convention neared  Ford appeared close to victory  Acknowledging his party s moderate wing  Reagan chose moderate Senator Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania as his running mate if nominated  Nonetheless  Ford prevailed with 1 187 delegates to Reagan s 1 070  88  Ford would go on to lose the 1976 Presidential election to the Democrat Jimmy Carter  Reagan s concession speech emphasized the dangers of nuclear war and the threat posed by the Soviet Union  Though he lost the nomination  he received 307 write in votes in New Hampshire  388 votes as an Independent on Wyoming s ballot  and a single electoral vote from a faithless elector in the November election from the

receiving the Republican nomination  Reagan selected one of his primary opponents  George H W  Bush  to be his running mate  His showing in the October televised debate boosted his campaign  Reagan

California where he was governor  which would have banned gays  lesbians  and supporters of LGBT rights from working in public schools in California  His opposition to the initiative was instrumental

was that a child s sexual orientation cannot be influenced by someone else  100  Presidency  1981 1989 Main articles  Electoral history of Ronald Reagan  Domestic policy of the Ronald Reagan

Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization  1968  In summer 1981 PATCO  the union of federal air traffic controllers went on strike  violating a federal law prohibiting government unions from striking  111  Declaring the situation an emergency as described in the 1947 Taft Hartley Act  Reagan stated that if the air traffic controllers  do not report for work within 48 hours  they have forfeited their jobs and will be terminated   112  They did not return and on August 5  Reagan fired 11 345 striking air traffic controllers who had ignored his order  and used supervisors and military controllers to handle the nation s commercial air traffic until new controllers could be hired and trained  113  As a leading reference work on public administration concluded   The firing of PATCO employees not only demonstrated a clear resolve by the president to take control of the bureaucracy  but it also sent a clear message to the private sector that unions no longer needed to be feared   114   Reaganomics  and the economy Main article  Reaganomics During Jimmy Carter s last year in office  1980   inflation averaged 12 5   compared to 4 4  during Reagan s last year in office  1988   115  During Reagan s administration  the unemployment rate declined from 7 5  to 5 4   with the rate reaching highs of 10 8  in 1982 and 10 4  in 1983  averaging 7 5  over the eight years  116  117  Ronald Reagan s official White House portrait Reagan implemented policies based on supply side economics and advocated a classical liberal and laissez faire philosophy  118  seeking to stimulate the economy with large  across the board tax cuts  119  120  He also supported returning the U S  to some sort of gold standard  and successfully urged Congress to establish the U S  Gold Commission to study how one could be implemented  Citing the economic theories of Arthur Laffer  Reagan promoted the proposed tax cuts as potentially stimulating the economy enough to expand the tax base  offsetting the revenue loss due to reduced rates of taxation  a theory that entered political discussion as the Laffer curve  Reaganomics was the subject of debate with supporters pointing to improvements in certain key economic indicators as evidence of success  and critics pointing to large increases in federal budget deficits and the national debt  His policy of  peace through strength   also described as  firm but fair   resulted in a record peacetime defense buildup including a 40  real increase in defense spending between 1981 and 1985  121  During Reagan s presidency  federal income tax rates were lowered significantly with the signing of the bipartisan Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 122  which lowered the top marginal tax bracket from 70  to 50  and the lowest bracket from 14  to 11   however other tax increases passed by a Democratic party controlled Congress and signed by Reagan  ensured that tax revenues over his two terms were 18 2  of GDP as compared to 18 1  over the past 40 years  123  Then  in 1982 the Job Training Partnership Act of 1982 was signed into law  initiating one of the nation s first public private partnerships and a major part of the president s job creation program  Reagan s Assistant Secretary of Labor and Chief of Staff  Al Angrisani  was a primary architect of the bill  The Tax Reform Act of 1986  another bipartisan effort championed by Reagan  reduced the top rate further to 28  while raising the bottom bracket from 11  to 15  and reducing the quantity of brackets to 4  Conversely  Congress passed and Reagan signed into law tax increases of some nature in every year from 1981 to 1987 to continue funding such government programs as Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982  TEFRA   Social Security  and the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984  DEFRA   124  125  Despite the fact that TEFRA was the  largest peacetime tax increase in American history   Reagan is better known for his tax cuts and lower taxes philosophy  125  126  127  128  Real gross domestic product  GDP  growth recovered strongly after the early 1980s recession ended in 1982  and grew during his eight years in office at an annual rate of 3 85  per year  129  Unemployment peaked at 10 8  monthly rate in December 1982 higher than any time since the Great Depression then dropped during the rest of Reagan s presidency  130  Sixteen million new jobs were created  while inflation significantly decreased  131  The net effect of all Reagan era tax bills was a 1  decrease in government revenues when compared to Treasury Department revenue estimates from the Administration s first post enactment January budgets  132  However  federal Income Tax receipts increased from 1980 to 1989  rising from  308 7 billion to  549 billion  133  During the Reagan Administration  federal receipts grew at an average rate of 8 2   2 5  attributed to higher Social Security receipts   and federal outlays grew at an annual rate of 7 1   134  135  Reagan also revised the tax code with the bipartisan Tax Reform Act of 1986  136  Reagan gives a televised address from the Oval Office  outlining his plan for Tax Reduction Legislation in July 1981 Reagan s policies proposed that economic growth would occur when marginal tax rates were low enough to spur investment  137  which would then lead to increased economic growth  higher employment and wages  Critics labeled this  trickle down economics  the belief that tax policies that benefit the wealthy will create a  trickle down  effect to the poor  138  Questions arose whether Reagan s policies benefited the wealthy more than those living in poverty  139  and many poor and minority citizens viewed Reagan as indifferent to their struggles  139  These views were exacerbated by the fact that Reagan s economic regimen included freezing the minimum wage at  3 35 an hour  slashing federal assistance to local governments by 60   cutting the budget for public housing and Section 8 rent subsidies in half  and eliminating the antipoverty Community Development Block Grant program  140  The widening gap between the rich and poor had already begun during the 1970s before Reagan s economic policies took effect  141  However  Reagan s policies exacerbated the trend  as the 1981 cut in the top regular tax rate on unearned income reduced the maximum capital gains rate to only 20    its lowest level since the Hoover administration  142  Reagan later set tax rates on capital gains  which benefit the wealthy  at the same level as the rates on ordinary income like salaries and wages  with both topping out at 28   143  President Reagan  has remained popular as an antitax hero despite raising taxes eleven times over the course of his presidency  all in the name of fiscal responsibility  144  According to Paul Krugman   Over all  the 1982 tax increase undid about a third of the 1981 cut  as a share of G D P   the increase was substantially larger than Mr  Clinton s 1993 tax increase   145  Further following his less government intervention views  Reagan cut the budgets of non military 146  programs 147  including Medicaid  food stamps  federal education programs 146  and the EPA  148  While he protected entitlement programs  such as Social Security and Medicare  149  his administration attempted to purge many people with disabilities from the Social Security disability rolls  150  The administration s stance toward the Savings and Loan industry contributed to the Savings and loan crisis  151  It is also suggested  by a minority of Reaganomics critics  that the policies partially influenced the stock market crash of 1987  152  but there is no consensus regarding a single source for the crash  153  In order to cover newly spawned federal budget deficits  the United States borrowed heavily both domestically and abroad  raising the national debt from  997 billion to  2 85 trillion  154  Reagan described the new debt as the  greatest disappointment  of his presidency  131  He reappointed Paul Volcker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve  and in 1987 he appointed monetarist Alan Greenspan to succeed him  Reagan ended the price controls on domestic oil which had contributed to energy crises in the early 1970s  155  156  The price of oil subsequently dropped  and the 1980s did not see the fuel shortages that the 1970s had  157  Reagan also fulfilled a 1980 campaign promise to repeal the Windfall profit tax in 1988  which had previously increased dependence on foreign oil  158  Some economists  such as Nobel Prize winners Milton Friedman and Robert A  Mundell  argue that Reagan s tax policies invigorated America s economy and contributed to the economic boom of the 1990s  159  Other economists  such as Nobel Prize winner Robert Solow  argue that the deficits were a major reason why Reagan s successor  George H  W  Bush  reneged on a campaign promise and raised taxes  159  During Reagan s presidency  a program was initiated within the US intelligence community to ensure America s economic strength  The program  Project Socrates  developed and demonstrated the means required for the US to generate and lead the next evolutionary leap in technology acquisition and utilization for a competitive advantage automated innovation  To ensure that the US acquired the maximum benefit from automated innovation  President Reagan  during his second term  had an executive order drafted to create a new Federal agency to implement the Project Socrates results on a nation wide basis  However  President Reagan s term came to end before the executive order could be coordinated and signed  and the incoming Bush administration  labeling Project Socrates as  industrial policy   had it terminated  160  161  Lebanon and Operation Urgent Fury  Grenada   1983 Main articles  Beirut barracks bombing and Invasion of Grenada Reagan meets with Prime Minister Eugenia Charles of Dominica in the Oval Office about ongoing events in Grenada American peacekeeping forces in Beirut  a part of a multinational force during the Lebanese Civil War who had been earlier deployed by Reagan  were attacked on October 23  1983  The Beirut barracks bombing resulted in the deaths of 241 American servicemen and the wounding of more than 60 others by a suicide truck bomber  Reagan sent a White House team to the site four days later  led by his Vice President  George H W  Bush  Reagan called the attack  despicable   pledged to keep a military force in Lebanon  and planned to target the Sheik Abdullah barracks in Baalbek  Lebanon  training ground for Hezbollah fighters  162  163  but the mission was later aborted  On February 7  1984  President Reagan ordered the Marines to begin withdrawal from Lebanon  In April 1984  as his keynote address to the 20 000 attendees of the Rev  Jerry Falwell s  Baptist Fundamentalism  84  convention in Washington  D C   he read a first hand account of the bombing  written by Navy Chaplain  Rabbi  Arnold Resnicoff  who had been asked to write the report by Bush and his team  164 Osama bin Laden would later cite Reagan s withdrawal of forces as a sign of American weakness  165  On October 25  1983  only two days later  Reagan ordered U S  forces to invade Grenada  code named Operation Urgent Fury  where a 1979 coup d  tat had established an independent non aligned Marxist Leninist government  A formal appeal from the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States  OECS  led to the intervention of U S  forces  President Reagan also cited an allegedly regional threat posed by a Soviet Cuban military build up in the Caribbean and concern for the safety of several hundred American medical students at St  George s University as adequate reasons to invade  Operation Urgent Fury was the first major military operation conducted by U S  forces since the Vietnam War  several days of fighting commenced  resulting in a U S  victory  166  with 19 American fatalities and 116 wounded American soldiers  167  In mid December  after a new government was appointed by the Governor General  U S  forces withdrew  166  Escalation of the Cold War See also  Cold War and Cold War  1979 1985  Reagan escalated the Cold War  accelerating a reversal from the policy of d tente which began in 1979 following the Soviet war in Afghanistan  168  Reagan ordered a massive buildup of the United States Armed Forces 121  and implemented new policies towards the Soviet Union  reviving the B 1 Lancer program that had been canceled by the Carter administration  and producing the MX missile  169  In response to Soviet deployment of the SS 20  Reagan oversaw NATO s deployment of the Pershing missile in West Germany  170  Reagan  the first American president ever to address the British Parliament  predicts Marxism Leninism will be left on the  ash heap of history   171  Together with the United Kingdom s prime minister Margaret Thatcher  Reagan denounced the Soviet Union in ideological terms  172  In a famous address on June 8  1982 to the British Parliament in the Royal Gallery of the Palace of Westminster  Reagan said   the forward march of freedom and democracy will leave Marxism Leninism on the ash heap of history   173  174  On March 3  1983  he predicted that communism would collapse  stating   Communism is another sad  bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages even now are being written   175  In a speech to the National Association of Evangelicals on March 8  1983  Reagan called the Soviet Union  an evil empire   176  After Soviet fighters downed Korean Air Lines Flight 007 near Moneron Island on September 1  1983  carrying 269 people  including Georgia congressman Larry McDonald  Reagan labeled the act a  massacre  and declared that the Soviets had turned  against the world and the moral precepts which guide human relations among people everywhere   177  The Reagan administration responded to the incident by suspending all Soviet passenger air service to the United States  and dropped several agreements being negotiated with the Soviets  wounding them financially  177  As result of the shootdown  and the cause of KAL 007 s going astray thought to be inadequacies related to its navigational system  Reagan announced on September 16  1983 that the Global Positioning System would be made available for civilian use  free of charge  once completed in order to avert similar navigational errors in future  178  179  Under a policy that came to be known as the Reagan Doctrine  Reagan and his administration also provided overt and covert aid to anti communist resistance movements in an effort to  rollback  Soviet backed communist governments in Africa  Asia  and Latin America  180  Reagan deployed the CIA s Special Activities Division to Afghanistan and Pakistan  They were instrumental in training  equipping and leading Mujaheddin forces against the Soviet Army  181  182  President Reagan s Covert Action program has been given credit for assisting in ending the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan  183  though the US funded armaments introduced then would later pose a threat to US troops in the 2000s  decade  war in Afghanistan  184  However  in a break from the Carter policy of arming Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act  Reagan also agreed with the communist government in China to reduce the sale of arms to Taiwan  185  In March 1983  Reagan introduced the Strategic Defense Initiative  a defense project 186  that would have used ground and space based systems to protect the United States from attack by strategic nuclear ballistic missiles  187  Reagan believed that this defense shield could make nuclear war impossible  186  188  but disbelief that the technology could ever work led opponents to dub SDI  Star Wars  and argue that the technological objective was unattainable  186  The Soviets became concerned about the possible effects SDI would have  189  leader Yuri Andropov said it would put  the entire world in jeopardy   190  For those reasons  David Gergen  former aide to President Reagan  believes that in retrospect  SDI hastened the end of the Cold War  191  Critics labeled Reagan s foreign policies as aggressive  imperialistic  and chided them as  warmongering   though they were supported by leading American conservatives who argued that they were necessary to protect U S  security interests  189  A reformer  Mikhail Gorbachev  would later rise to power in the Soviet Union in 1985  implementing new policies for openness and reform that were called glasnost and perestroika  1984 presidential campaign Main article  United States presidential election  1984 1984 presidential electoral votes by state  Reagan  red  won every state except for Mondale s home state of Minnesota  and Washington  D C   Reagan accepted the Republican nomination in Dallas  Texas  on a wave of positive feeling  He proclaimed that it was  morning again in America   16  regarding the recovering economy and the dominating performance by the U S  athletes at the 1984 Summer Olympics  among other things  He became the first American president to open an Olympic Games held in the United States  192  Reagan s opponent in the 1984 presidential election was former Vice President Walter Mondale  With questions about Reagan s age  and a weak performance in the first presidential debate  his ability to perform the duties of president for another term was questioned  His apparent confused and forgetful behavior was evident to his supporters  they had previously known him clever and witty  Rumors began to circulate that he had Alzheimer s disease  193  194  Reagan rebounded in the second debate  and confronted questions about his age  quipping   I will not make age an issue of this campaign  I am not going to exploit  for political purposes  my opponent s youth and inexperience   which generated applause and laughter  even from Mondale himself  195  That November  Reagan was re elected  winning 49 of 50 states  196  The president s overwhelming victory saw Mondale carry only his home state of Minnesota  by 3800 votes  and the District of Columbia  Reagan won a record 525 electoral votes  the most of any candidate in United States history  197  and received 58 8  of the popular vote to Mondale s 40 6   196  Second term  1985 1989 Reagan was sworn in as president for the second time on January 20  1985  in a private ceremony at the White House  Because January 20 fell on a Sunday  a public celebration was not held but took place in the Capitol Rotunda the following day  January 21 was one of the coldest days on record in Washington  D C   due to poor weather  inaugural celebrations were held inside the Capitol  In the coming weeks he shook up his staff somewhat  moving White House Chief of Staff James Baker to Secretary of the Treasury and naming Treasury Secretary Donald Regan  a former Merrill Lynch officer  Chief of Staff  198  198  Ronald Reagan is sworn in for a second term as president in the Capitol Rotunda In 1985  Reagan visited a German military cemetery in Bitburg to lay a wreath with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl  It was determined that the cemetery held the graves of forty nine members of the Waffen SS  Reagan issued a statement that called the Nazi soldiers buried in that cemetery as themselves  victims   a designation which ignited a stir over whether Reagan had equated the SS men to victims of the Holocaust  Patrick J  Buchanan  Reagan s Director of Communications  argued that the president did not equate the SS members with the actual Holocaust  199  Now strongly urged to cancel the visit  200  the president responded that it would be wrong to back down on a promise he had made to Chancellor Kohl  He ultimately attended the ceremony where two military generals laid a wreath  201  The disintegration of the Space Shuttle Challenger on January 28  1986 proved a pivotal moment in Reagan s presidency  All seven astronauts aboard were killed  202  On the night of the disaster  Reagan delivered a speech  written by Peggy Noonan  in which he said  The future doesn t belong to the fainthearted  it belongs to the brave    We will never forget them  nor the last time we saw them  this morning  as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and  slipped the surly bonds of Earth  to  touch the face of God   203  War on Drugs Main article  War on Drugs Midway into his second term  Reagan declared more militant policies in the War on Drugs  He said that  drugs were menacing our society  and promised to fight for drug free schools and workplaces  expanded drug treatment  stronger law enforcement and drug interdiction efforts  and greater public awareness  204  205  In 1986  Reagan signed a drug enforcement bill that budgeted  1 7 billion to fund the War on Drugs and specified a mandatory minimum penalty for drug offenses  206  The bill was criticized for promoting significant racial disparities in the prison population 206  and critics also charged that the policies did little to reduce the availability of drugs on the street  while resulting in a great financial burden for America  207  Defenders of the effort point to success in reducing rates of adolescent drug use  208  209 First Lady Nancy Reagan made the War on Drugs her main priority by founding the  Just Say No  drug awareness campaign  which aimed to discourage children and teenagers from engaging in recreational drug use by offering various ways of saying  no   Mrs  Reagan traveled to 65 cities in 33 states  raising awareness about the dangers of drugs including alcohol  210  Libya bombing Main article  1986 Bombing of Libya Relations between Libya and the U S  under President Reagan were continually contentious  beginning with the Gulf of Sidra incident in 1981  by 1982  Gaddafi was considered by the CIA to be  along with USSR leader Leonid Brezhnev and Cuban leader Fidel Castro  211  part of a group known as the  unholy trinity  211  and was also labeled as  our international public enemy number one  by a CIA official  211  These tensions were later revived in early April 1986  when a bomb exploded in a Berlin discoth que  resulting in the injury of 63 American military personnel and death of one serviceman  212  Stating that there was  irrefutable proof  that Libya had directed the  terrorist bombing   Reagan authorized the use of force against the country  212  In the late evening of April 15  1986  the U S  launched a series of air strikes on ground targets in Libya  212  213  The UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher allowed the US Air Force to use Britain s air bases to launch the attack  on the justification that the UK was supporting America s right to self defense under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter  213  The attack was designed to halt Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi s  ability to export terrorism   offering him  incentives and reasons to alter his criminal behavior   212  The president addressed the nation from the Oval Office after the attacks had commenced  stating   When our citizens are attacked or abused anywhere in the world on the direct orders of hostile regimes  we will respond so long as I m in this office   213  As early as 1981  Reagan had referred to Gaddafi as  the mad dog of the Middle East  214  and considered him to be public enemy number one  215  Immigration Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act in 1986  The act made it illegal to knowingly hire or recruit illegal immigrants  required employers to attest to their employees  immigration status  and granted amnesty to approximately 3 million illegal immigrants who entered the United States prior to January 1  1982  and had lived in the country continuously  Critics argue that the employer sanctions were without teeth and failed to stem illegal immigration  216  Upon signing the act at a ceremony held beside the newly refurbished Statue of Liberty  Reagan said   The legalization provisions in this act will go far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows  without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society  Very soon many of these men and women will be able to step into the sunlight and  ultimately  if they choose  they may become Americans   217  Reagan also said   The employer sanctions program is the keystone and major element  It will remove the incentive for illegal immigration by eliminating the job opportunities which draw illegal aliens here   217  Iran Contra affair Main articles  Iran Contra affair  Reagan administration scandals  and Nicaragua v  United States President Reagan receives the Tower Report in the Cabinet Room of the White House  1987 In 1986  a scandal shook the administration stemming from the use of proceeds from covert arms sales to Iran to fund the Contras in Nicaragua  which had been specifically outlawed by an act of Congress  218  219  The Iran Contra affair became the largest political scandal in the United States during the 1980s  220  The International Court of Justice  whose jurisdiction to decide the case was disputed  221  ruled that the U S  had violated international law in Nicaragua due to its obligations not to intervene in the affairs of other states  222  President Reagan professed ignorance of the plot s existence  He appointed two Republicans and one Democrat  John Tower  Brent Scowcroft and Edmund Muskie  known as the  Tower Commission   to investigate the scandal  The commission could not find direct evidence that Reagan had prior knowledge of the program  but criticized him heavily for his disengagement from managing his staff  making the diversion of funds possible  223  A separate report by Congress concluded that  If the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing  he should have   223  Reagan s popularity declined from 67  to 46  in less than a week  the greatest and quickest decline ever for a president  224  The scandal resulted in fourteen indictments within Reagan s staff  and eleven convictions  225  Many Central Americans criticize Reagan for his support of the Contras  calling him an anti communist zealot  blinded to human rights abuses  while others say he  saved Central America   226 Daniel Ortega  Sandinistan and current president of Nicaragua  said that he hoped God would forgive Reagan for his  dirty war against Nicaragua   226  In 1986 the USA was found guilty by the International Court of Justice  World Court  of war crimes against Nicaragua  227  End of the Cold War See also  Cold War  1985 1991  Ronald Reagan speaks at the Berlin Wall s Brandenburg Gate  challenging Gorbachev to  tear down this wall   By the early 1980s  many people in the US perceived that the USSR military capabilities were gaining on that of the United States  Previously  the U S  had relied on the qualitative superiority of its weapons to essentially frighten the Soviets  but the gap had been narrowed  228  Although the Soviet Union did not accelerate military spending after President Reagan s military buildup  229  their large military expenses  in combination with collectivized agriculture and inefficient planned manufacturing  were a heavy burden for the Soviet economy  230  At the same time  Saudi Arabia increased oil production  231  which resulted in a drop of oil prices in 1985 to one third of the previous level  oil was the main source of Soviet export revenues  230  These factors gradually brought the Soviet economy to a stagnant state during Gorbachev s tenure  230  Reagan recognized the change in the direction of the Soviet leadership with Mikhail Gorbachev  and shifted to diplomacy  with a view to encourage the Soviet leader to pursue substantial arms agreements  232  Reagan s personal mission was to achieve  a world free of nuclear weapons   which he regarded as  totally irrational  totally inhumane  good for nothing but killing  possibly destructive of life on earth and civilization   233  234  235  He was able to start discussions on nuclear disarmament with General Secretary Gorbachev  235  Gorbachev and Reagan held four summit conferences between 1985 and 1988  the first in Geneva  Switzerland  the second in Reykjav k  Iceland  the third in Washington  D C   and the fourth in Moscow  236  Reagan believed that if he could persuade the Soviets to allow for more democracy and free speech  this would lead to reform and the end of Communism  237  Speaking at the Berlin Wall on June 12  1987  Reagan challenged Gorbachev to go further  saying     General Secretary Gorbachev  if you seek peace  if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe  if you seek liberalization  come here to this gate  Mr  Gorbachev  open this gate  Mr  Gorbachev  tear down this wall     Gorbachev and Reagan sign the INF Treaty at the White House in 1987 Prior to Gorbachev visiting Washington  D C   for the third summit in 1987  the Soviet leader announced his intention to pursue significant arms agreements  238  The timing of the announcement led Western diplomats to contend that Gorbachev was offering major concessions to the U S  on the levels of conventional forces  nuclear weapons  and policy in Eastern Europe  238  He and Reagan signed the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces  INF  Treaty at the White House  which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons  239  The two leaders laid the framework for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty  or START I  Reagan insisted that the name of the treaty be changed from Strategic Arms Limitation Talks to Strategic Arms Reduction Talks  234  When Reagan visited Moscow for the fourth summit in 1988  he was viewed as a celebrity by the Soviets  A journalist asked the president if he still considered the Soviet Union the evil empire   No   he replied   I was talking about another time  another era   240  At Gorbachev s request  Reagan gave a speech on free markets at the Moscow State University  241  In his autobiography  An American Life  Reagan expressed his optimism about the new direction that they charted and his warm feelings for Gorbachev  242  In November 1989  the Berlin Wall was torn down  the Cold War was officially declared over at a Malta Summit on December 3  1989 243  and two years later  the Soviet Union collapsed  Health Early in his presidency  Reagan started wearing a custom  technologically advanced hearing aid  first in his right ear 244  and later in his left as well  245  His decision to go public in 1983 regarding his wearing the small  audio amplifying device boosted their sales  246  On July 13  1985  Reagan underwent surgery at Bethesda Naval Hospital to remove cancerous polyps from his colon  He relinquished presidential power to the Vice President for eight hours in a similar procedure as outlined in the 25th Amendment  which he specifically avoided invoking  247  The surgery lasted just under three hours and was successful  248  Reagan resumed the powers of the presidency later that day  249  In August of that year  he underwent an operation to remove skin cancer cells from his nose  250  In October  additional skin cancer cells were detected on his nose and removed  251  In January 1987  Reagan underwent surgery for an enlarged prostate which caused further worries about his health  No cancerous growths were found  however  and he was not sedated during the operation  252  In July of that year  aged 76  he underwent a third skin cancer operation on his nose  253  Judiciary Main articles  Ronald Reagan Supreme Court candidates and Ronald Reagan judicial appointments During his 1980 campaign  Reagan pledged that  if given the opportunity  he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice  254  That opportunity came in his first year in office when he nominated Sandra Day O Connor to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Potter Stewart  In his second term  Reagan elevated William Rehnquist to succeed Warren Burger as Chief Justice  and named Antonin Scalia to fill the vacant seat  Reagan nominated conservative jurist Robert Bork to the high court in 1987  Senator Ted Kennedy  a Democrat of Massachusetts  strongly condemned Bork  and great controversy ensued  255  Bork s nomination was rejected 58 42  256  Reagan then nominated Douglas Ginsburg  but Ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration after coming under fire for his cannabis use  257 Anthony Kennedy was eventually confirmed in his place  258  Along with his three Supreme Court appointments  Reagan appointed 83 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals  and 290 judges to the United States district courts  Reagan also nominated Vaughn R  Walker  who would later be revealed to be the earliest known gay federal judge  259  to the United States District Court for the Central District of California  However  the nomination stalled in the Senate  and Walker was not confirmed until he was renominated by Reagan s successor  George H  W  Bush  260  Post presidential years  1989 2004 Ronald and Nancy Reagan in Los Angeles after leaving the White House  early 1990s After leaving office in 1989  the Reagans purchased a home in Bel Air  Los Angeles in addition to the Reagan Ranch in Santa Barbara  They regularly attended Bel Air Presbyterian Church 261  and occasionally made appearances on behalf of the Republican Party  Reagan delivered a well received speech at the 1992 Republican National Convention  262  Previously on November 4  1991  the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library was dedicated and opened to the public  At the dedication ceremonies  five presidents were in attendance  as well as six first ladies  marking the first time five presidents were gathered in the same location  263  Reagan continued publicly to speak in favor of a line item veto  the Brady Bill  264  a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget  and the repeal of the 22nd Amendment  which prohibits anyone from serving more than two terms as president  265  In 1992 Reagan established the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award with the newly formed Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation  266  His final public speech was on February 3  1994 during a tribute to him in Washington  D C   and his last major public appearance was at the funeral of Richard Nixon on April 27  1994  Alzheimer s disease Announcement and reaction In August 1994  at the age of 83  Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer s disease  267  an incurable neurological disorder which destroys brain cells and ultimately causes death  267  268  In November he informed the nation through a handwritten letter  267  writing in part  I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer s Disease    At the moment I feel just fine  I intend to live the remainder of the years God gives me on this earth doing the things I have always done    I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life  I know that for America there will always be a bright dawn ahead  Thank you  my friends  May God always bless you  269  After his diagnosis  letters of support from well wishers poured into his California home  270  but there was also speculation over how long Reagan had demonstrated symptoms of mental degeneration  271  In her memoirs  former CBS White House correspondent Lesley Stahl recounts her final meeting with the president  in 1986   Reagan didn t seem to know who I was      Oh  my  he s gonzo  I thought  I have to go out on the lawn tonight and tell my countrymen that the president of the United States is a doddering space cadet   But then  at the end  he regained his alertness  As she described it   I had come that close to reporting that Reagan was senile   272  However  Dr  Lawrence K  Altman  a physician employed as a reporter for the New York Times  noted that  the line between mere forgetfulness and the beginning of Alzheimer s can be fuzzy  273  and all four of Reagan s White House doctors said that they saw no evidence of Alzheimer s while he was president  273  Dr  John E  Hutton  Reagan s primary physician from 1984 to 1989  said the president  absolutely  did not  show any signs of dementia or Alzheimer s   273  Reagan did experience occasional memory lapses  though  especially with names  273  Once  while meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone  he repeatedly referred to Vice President Bush as  Prime Minister Bush   274  Reagan s doctors  however  note that he only began exhibiting overt symptoms of the illness in late 1992 275  or 1993  273  several years after he had left office  His former Chief of Staff James Baker considered  ludicrous  the idea of Reagan sleeping during cabinet meetings  276  Other staff members  former aides  and friends said they saw no indication of Alzheimer s while he was President  273  The Reagans with a model of USS Ronald Reagan  May 1996  At left is Newport News Shipbuilding Chairman and CEO Bill Fricks  Complicating the picture  Reagan suffered an episode of head trauma in July 1989  five years prior to his diagnosis  After being thrown from a horse in Mexico  a subdural hematoma was found and surgically treated later in the year  267  268  Nancy Reagan asserts that her husband s 1989 fall hastened the onset of Alzheimer s disease  268  citing what doctors told her  268  although acute brain injury has not been conclusively proven to accelerate Alzheimer s or dementia  277  278  Reagan s one time physician Dr  Daniel Ruge has said it is possible  but not certain  that the horse accident affected the course of Reagan s memory  279  Progression As the years went on  the disease slowly destroyed Reagan s mental capacity  273  He was only able to recognize a few people  including his wife  Nancy  273  He remained active  however  he took walks through parks near his home and on beaches  played golf regularly  and until 1999 he often went to his office in nearby Century City  273  Reagan suffered a fall at his Bel Air home on January 13  2001  resulting in a broken hip  280  The fracture was repaired the following day 281  and the 89 year old Reagan returned home later that week  although he faced difficult physical therapy at home  282  On February 6  2001  Reagan reached the age of 90  becoming the third former president to do so  the other two being John Adams and Herbert Hoover  with Gerald Ford later reaching 90   283  Reagan s public appearances became much less frequent with the progression of the disease  and as a result  his family decided that he would live in quiet semi isolation with his wife Nancy  Nancy Reagan told CNN s Larry King in 2001 that very few visitors were allowed to see her husband because she felt that  Ronnie would want people to remember him as he was   284  Following her husband s diagnosis and death  Mrs  Reagan became a stem cell research advocate  urging Congress and President George W  Bush to support federal funding for embryonic stem cell research  something Bush opposed  In 2009  she praised President Barack Obama for lifting restrictions on such research  285  Mrs  Reagan has said that she believes that it could lead to a cure for Alzheimer s  286  Death Main article  Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan Reagan s casket lying in state in the United States Capitol Rotunda Reagan died of pneumonia 287  at his home in Bel Air  California on the afternoon of June 5  2004  288  A short time after his death  Nancy Reagan released a statement saying   My family and I would like the world to know that President Ronald Reagan has died after 10 years of Alzheimer s Disease at 93 years of age  We appreciate everyone s prayers   288  President George W  Bush declared June 11 a National Day of Mourning  289  and international tributes came in from around the world  290  Reagan s body was taken to the Kingsley and Gates Funeral Home in Santa Monica  California later in the day  where well wishers paid tribute by laying flowers and American flags in the grass  291  On June 7  his body was removed and taken to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library  where a brief family funeral was held conducted by Pastor Michael Wenning  His body lay in repose in the Library lobby until June 9  over 100 000 people viewed the coffin  292  On June 9  Reagan s body was flown to Washington  D C  where he became the tenth United States president to lie in state  in thirty four hours  104 684 people filed past the coffin  293  On June 11  a state funeral was conducted in the Washington National Cathedral  and presided over by President George W  Bush  Eulogies were given by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher  294  former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney  and both Presidents Bush  Also in attendance were Mikhail Gorbachev  and many world leaders  including British Prime Minister Tony Blair  German Chancellor Gerhard Schr der  Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi  and interim presidents Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan  and Ghazi al Yawer of Iraq  After the funeral  the Reagan entourage was flown back to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California  where another service was held  and President Reagan was interred  295  At the time of his death  Reagan was the longest lived president in U S  history  having lived 93 years and 120 days  2 years  8 months  and 23 days longer than John Adams  whose record he surpassed   He is now the second longest lived president  just 45 days fewer than Gerald Ford  He was the first United States president to die in the 21st century  and his was the first state funeral in the United States since that of President Lyndon B  Johnson in 1973  His burial site is inscribed with the words he delivered at the opening of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library   I know in my heart that man is good  that what is right will always eventually triumph and that there is purpose and worth to each and every life   296  Legacy Ronald Reagan in 1976 at his home at Rancho del Cielo Since Reagan left office in 1989  substantial debate has occurred among scholars  historians  and the general public surrounding his legacy  Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of Reaganomics  297  foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War after Reagan s eight years in office  298  and a restoration of American pride and morale  103  Critics contend that Reagan s economic policies resulted in huge budget deficits  131  a wider gap in wealth  and an increase in homelessness 140  and that the Iran Contra affair lowered American credibility  299  Despite the ongoing debates  Reagan has ranked among the most popular of all modern U S  presidents in public opinion polls  300  Opinions of Reagan s legacy among the country s leading policy makers and journalists differ as well  Edwin Feulner  President of The Heritage Foundation  said that Reagan  helped create a safer  freer world  and said of his economic policies   He took an America suffering from  malaise     and made its citizens believe again in their destiny   301  However  Mark Weisbrot  co Director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research  contended that Reagan s  economic policies were mostly a failure  302  while Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post opined that Reagan was  a far more controversial figure in his time than the largely gushing obits on television would suggest   303  Despite the continuing debate surrounding his legacy  many conservative and liberal scholars agree that Reagan has been the most influential president since Franklin D  Roosevelt  leaving his imprint on American politics  diplomacy  culture  and economics  Since he left office  historians have reached a consensus  304  as summarized by British historian M  J  Heale  who finds that scholars now concur that Reagan rehabilitated conservatism  turned the nation to the right  practiced a considerably pragmatic conservatism that balanced ideology and the constraints of politics  revived faith in the presidency and in American self respect  and contributed to victory in the Cold War  305  Cold War The Cold War was a major political and economic endeavor for over four decades  but the confrontation between the two superpowers had decreased dramatically by the end of Reagan s presidency  306  The significance of Reagan s role in ending the Cold War has spurred contentious and opinionated debate  307  308  309  That Reagan had some role in contributing to the downfall of the Soviet Union is collectively agreed  but the extent of this role is continuously debated  232  with many believing that Reagan s defense policies  hard line rhetoric against the Soviet Union and Communism  as well as summits with General Secretary Gorbachev played a significant part in ending the War  139  232  United States President Ronald Reagan  left  and President of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev meet in 1985  He was notable amongst post World War II presidents as being convinced that the Soviet Union could be defeated rather than simply negotiated with  232  a conviction that was vindicated by Gennadi Gerasimov  the Foreign Ministry spokesman under Gorbachev  who said that Star Wars was  very successful blackmail      The Soviet economy couldn t endure such competition   310  Reagan s strong rhetoric toward the nation had mixed effects  Jeffery W  Knopf  PhD observes that being labeled  evil  probably made no difference to the Soviets but gave encouragement to the East European citizens opposed to communism  232  That Reagan had little or no effect in ending the Cold War is argued with equal weight  that Communism s internal weakness had become apparent  and the Soviet Union would have collapsed in the end regardless of who was in power  232  President Harry Truman s policy of containment is also regarded as a force behind the fall of the U S S R   and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan undermined the Soviet system itself  308  General Secretary Gorbachev said of his former rival s Cold War role    He was  a man who was instrumental in bringing about the end of the Cold War   311  and deemed him  a great President   311  Gorbachev does not acknowledge a win or loss in the war  but rather a peaceful end  he said he was not intimidated by Reagan s harsh rhetoric  312  Margaret Thatcher  former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom  said of Reagan   he warned that the Soviet Union had an insatiable drive for military power    but he also sensed it was being eaten away by systemic failures impossible to reform   313  She later said   Ronald Reagan had a higher claim than any other leader to have won the Cold War for liberty and he did it without a shot being fired   314  Said Brian Mulroney  former Prime Minister of Canada   He enters history as a strong and dramatic player  in the Cold War    315  Former President Lech Wa  sa of Poland acknowledged   Reagan was one of the world leaders who made a major contribution to communism s collapse   316  Domestic and political legacy Ronald Reagan reshaped the Republican party  led the modern conservative movement  and altered the political dynamic of the United States  317  More men voted Republican under Reagan  and Reagan tapped into religious voters  317  The so called  Reagan Democrats  were a result of his presidency  317  After leaving office  Reagan became an iconic influence within the Republican party  318  His policies and beliefs have been frequently invoked by Republican presidential candidates since 1989  16  The 2008 Republican presidential candidates were no exception  for they aimed to liken themselves to him during the primary debates  even imitating his campaign strategies  319  Republican nominee John McCain frequently stated that he came to office as  a foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution   320  Lastly  Reagan s most famous statement that  Government is not a solution to our problem  government is the problem   has become the unofficial slogan for the rise of conservative commentators like Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh  as well as the emergence of the Tea Party Movement  140  Cultural and political image According to columnist Chuck Raasch   Reagan transformed the American presidency in ways that only a few have been able to   321  He redefined the political agenda of the times  advocating lower taxes  a conservative economic philosophy  and a stronger military  322  His role in the Cold War further enhanced his image as a different kind of leader  323  324  Reagan s  avuncular style  optimism  and plain folks demeanor  also helped him turn  government bashing into an art form   140  Ronald Reagan s approval ratings Date Event Approval     Disapproval     March 30  1981 Shot by Hinckley 73 19 January 22  1983 High unemployment 42 54 April 26  1986 Libya bombing 70 26 February

approval ratings  325  but his popularity has increased since 1989  Gallup polls in 2001 and 2007 ranked him number one or number two when correspondents were asked for the greatest president in history  and third of post World War II presidents in a 2007 Rasmussen Reports poll  fifth in an ABC 2000 poll  ninth in another 2007 Rasmussen poll  and eighth in a late 2008 poll by United Kingdom newspaper The Times  326  327  328  In a Siena College survey of over 200 historians  however  Reagan ranked sixteenth out of 42  329  330  While the debate about Reagan s legacy is ongoing  the 2009 Annual C SPAN Survey of Presidential Leaders ranked Reagan the 10th greatest president  The survey of leading historians rated Reagan number 11 in 2000  331  Ronald Reagan s approval ratings  Gallup 1981 89  In 2011  the Institute for the Study of the Americas released the first ever U K  academic survey to rate U S  presidents  This poll of U K  specialists in U S  history and politics placed Reagan as the 8th greatest U S  president  332  Reagan s ability to connect with the American people 333  earned him the laudatory moniker  The Great Communicator   334  Of it  Reagan said   I won the nickname the great communicator  But I never thought it was my style that made a difference it was the content  I wasn t a great communicator  but I communicated great things   335  His age and soft spoken speech gave him a warm grandfatherly image  336  337  338  Reagan also earned the nickname  the Teflon President   in that public perceptions of him were not tarnished by the controversies that arose during his administration  339  According to Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder  who coined the phrase  and reporter Howard Kurtz  the epithet referred to Reagan s ability to  do almost anything wrong 339  and not get blamed for it   333  340  Public reaction to Reagan was always mixed  the oldest president was supported by young voters  and began an alliance that shifted many of them to the Republican party  341  Reagan did not fare well with minority groups  especially African Americans  197  This was largely due to his opposition to affirmative action policies  342  However  his support of Israel throughout his presidency earned him support from many Jews  and he became the first Republican ever to win the Jewish vote  343  He emphasized family values in his campaigns and during his presidency  although he was the first president to have been divorced  344  The combination of Reagan s speaking style  unabashed patriotism  negotiation skills  as well as his savvy use of the media  played an important role in defining the 1980s and his future legacy  345  Reagan was known to joke frequently during his lifetime  displayed humor throughout his presidency  346  and was famous for his storytelling  347  His numerous jokes and one liners have been labeled  classic quips  and  legendary   348  Among the most notable of his jokes was one regarding the Cold War  As a sound check prior to his weekly radio address in August 1984  Reagan made the following joke as a way to test the microphone   My fellow Americans  I m pleased to tell you today that I ve signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever  We begin bombing in five minutes   349  Former aide David Gergen commented   It was that humor    that I think endeared people to Reagan   191  Honors
