and from Indonesia s Riau Islands by the Singapore Strait to its south  Singapore is highly urbanised but almost half of the country is covered by greenery  More land is being created for development through land reclamation  Singapore had been a part of various local empires since it was first inhabited in the second century AD  Modern Singapore was founded as a trading post of the East India Company by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819 with permission from the Sultanate of Johor  The British obtained full sovereignty over the island in 1824 and Singapore became one of the British Straits Settlements in 1826  Singapore was occupied by the Japanese in World War II and reverted to British rule after the war  It became internally self governing in 1959  Singapore united with other former British territories to form Malaysia in 1963 and became a fully independent state two years later after separation from Malaysia  Since then it has had a massive increase in wealth  and is one of the Four Asian Tigers  The economy depends heavily on the industry and service sectors  Singapore is a world leader in several areas  It is the world s fourth leading financial centre  the world s second

foundations in the English common law system  but modifications have been made to it over the years  such as the removal of trial by jury  The PAP s popular image is that of a strong  experienced and highly qualified government  backed by a skilled Civil Service and an education system with an emphasis on achievement and meritocracy  but it is perceived by some voters  opposition critics and

Etymology Main article  Names of Singapore The English name of Singapore is derived from the Malay word Singapura  Sanskrit           lit  Lion City   hence the customary reference to the nation as the Lion City  Lions probably never lived there  the beast seen by Sang Nila Utama  who founded and named ancient Singapore  was most likely a tiger  11  12  History Main article  History of Singapore Victorious Japanese troops marching through Singapore City after British capitulation at the Battle of Singapore The earliest known settlement on Singapore was in the second century AD  It was an outpost of the Sumatran Srivijaya empire  named Temasek   sea town    Between the 16th and early 19th centuries  it was part of the Sultanate of Johor  In 1613  Portuguese raiders burnt down the settlement and the island sank into obscurity for the next two centuries  13  In 1819  Thomas Stamford Raffles  founder of Singapore  arrived and signed a treaty with Sultan Hussein Shah on behalf of the British East India Company to develop the southern part of Singapore as a British trading post  In 1824  the entire island became a British possession under a further treaty whereby the Sultan and the Temenggong transferred it to the British East India Company  In 1826  it became part of the British Straits Settlements  becoming its capital in 1836  14  Before Raffles arrived  there were around 1 000 people living in Singapore  mostly Malays and a few dozen Chinese  15  By 1869  due to migration from Malaya and other parts of Asia  Singapore s population had reached 100 000  Many Chinese and Indian immigrants came to Singapore to work in the rubber plantations and tin mines  and their descendents later formed the bulk of Singapore s population  16  During World War II  the Imperial Japanese Army invaded Malaya culminating in the Battle of Singapore  The British were defeated  and surrendered on 15 February 1942  British Prime Minister Winston Churchill called this  the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history   17  The Sook Ching massacre of ethnic Chinese after the fall of Singapore claimed between 5 000 and 25 000 lives  18  The Japanese occupied Singapore until the British repossessed it in September 1945 after the Japanese surrender  19  Singapore s first general election in 1955 was won by the pro independence David Marshall  leader of the Labour Front  Demanding complete self rule he led a delegation to London but was turned down by the British  He resigned when he returned and was replaced by Lim Yew Hock  whose policies convinced Britain to grant Singapore full internal self government for all matters except defence and foreign affairs  20  During the May 1959 elections  the People s Action Party won a landslide victory  Singapore had become an internally self governing state within the Commonwealth  with Lee Kuan Yew as the first Prime Minister  21 Governor Sir William Allmond Codrington Goode served as the first Yang di Pertuan Negara  and was succeeded by Yusof bin Ishak who in 1965 became the first President of Singapore  22  During the 1950s  Singapore started to face a Communist threat which lasted till the early 1970s  The Communists  mostly supported by the Chinese speaking group  with strong ties to the trade unions and Chinese schools  carried out an armed struggle against the state  resulting in the Malayan Emergency and later  the Communist Insurgency War  The 1954 National Service Riots  Chinese middle schools riots and Hock Lee bus riots in Singapore were all linked to the Communists  23  On 31 August 1963  Singapore declared independence from Britain and joined with Malaya  Sabah and Sarawak to form the new Federation of Malaysia as the result of the 1962 Merger Referendum  Singaporean leaders joined Malaysia for various reasons  Firstly  as a small country  they did not believe that the British would find it viable for Singapore to become independent by itself  Secondly  they also did not believe that Singapore could survive on its own  due to scarcity of land  water  markets and natural resources  And lastly  the Singapore government wanted the help of the Malaysian government to flush out the Communists  The two years that Singapore spent as part of Malaysia were filled with strife and bitter disagreements  The Malaysians insisted on a pro Malay society  where Malays were given special Bumiputera rights  which still exists to this day  The Malaysians were also suspicious about Singapore s majority of ethnic Chinese and worried that Singapore s economic clout would shift the centre of power from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore  There were also linguistic and religious issues  The Singaporeans  on the other hand  wanted an equal and meritocratic society  where all citizens were given equal rights  As part of Malaysia  Singapore s economic and social development came to a halt as the Malaysian parliament blocked many bills  Race riots broke out in Singapore in 1964  After much heated ideological conflicts between the two governments  in 1965  the Malaysian parliament voted 126 to 0 to expel Singapore from Malaysia  3  24  25  Singapore gained independence as the Republic of Singapore  remaining within the Commonwealth  on 9 August 1965 3  with Yusof bin Ishak as president and Lee Kuan Yew as prime minister  Every one who was present in Singapore on the date of independence was offered Singapore citizenship  In 1967  it helped found the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 26  and in 1970 it joined the Non aligned movement  In 1990  Goh Chok Tong succeeded Lee as prime minister  During his tenure the country faced the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis  the 2003 SARS outbreak and terrorist threats posed by Jemaah Islamiyah  In 2004  Lee Hsien Loong  the eldest son of Lee Kuan Yew  became the country s third prime minister  27  Government and politics Main articles  Government of Singapore  Politics of Singapore  and Human rights

parliamentary elections in 2011  the opposition  led by the Workers  Party  made significant gains and increased its representation in the House to 6 elected MPs  33  The legal system of Singapore is based on English common law  albeit with substantial local differences  Trial by jury was entirely abolished in 1970 leaving judicial assessment performed wholly by judgeship  34  Singapore has penalties that include judicial corporal punishment in the form of caning for rape  rioting  vandalism  and some immigration offences  35  36  There is a mandatory death penalty for murder  and for certain drug trafficking and firearms offences  37 Amnesty International has said that some legal provisions conflict with the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty  and that Singapore has  possibly the highest execution rate in the world relative to its population   38  The government has disputed Amnesty s claims  39  In a 2008 survey  international business executives believed Singapore  along with Hong Kong  had the best judicial system in Asia  40  In 2010  Singapore was ranked first for  access to civil justice  and  order and security  by the World Justice Project Rule

corner  and there are also many CCTVs in the park  a situation that had some Singaporeans and Singaporean MPs complaining  44  45  Geography Main article  Geography of Singapore Outline of Singapore

underlying principle is political and economic stability in the region  72  It has diplomatic relations with 175 other sovereign states  102  As one of the five founding members of the Association of South East Asian Nations  ASEAN   103  the country is a strong supporter of the ASEAN Free Trade Area and the ASEAN Investment Area  because Singapore s economic growth is closely linked with the economic progress of the region as a whole  Former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong proposed the formation of an ASEAN Economic Community  a step beyond the current AFTA bringing it closer to a common market  This idea was agreed to in 2007 for implementation by 2015  Other regional organisations are also important to Singapore  and it is the host of the APEC Secretariat  Singapore also maintains

Movement 104  and the Commonwealth  105  In general  bilateral relations with other ASEAN members are strong  however  disagreements have arisen  72  and relations with neighbouring Malaysia and Indonesia have historically been very strained and difficult  106  Malaysia has often clashed with Singapore over the delivery of fresh water to Singapore  107  and the Singaporean government has threatened to send troops into Malaysia should the Malaysians break water contracts signed with Singapore and unilaterally cut off the water supply to Singapore  108  Conflicts have also arisen over the Singapore Armed Forces entering Malaysian airspace  the sovereignity of Pedra Branca  the relocation of Tanjong Pagar railway station  and many other ideological and cultural issues  106  Border issues exist with both Malaysia and Indonesia  and both have banned the sale of marine sand to Singapore over disputes about Singapore s land reclamation  109  Some previous disputes have been

and American fighter aircraft  More than 100 American Navy warships call at Singapore annually  and there is a modest presence of less than 200 US military personnel based permanently in Singapore  Several naval bases in Singapore were built to US specifications  so as to allow American ships  especially carriers  to dock  In 2011  the US Navy announced plans to station several of its new Littoral combat ships in Singapore permanently  113  114  The Singapore government believes that regional security  and by extension Singapore s security  will be affected if the United States loses its resolve in Iraq  115  Singapore faces the threat of terrorism itself  as evidenced by the Singapore embassies attack plot  Singapore has pushed regional counter terrorism initiatives  with a strong resolve to deal with terrorists inside its borders  To this end it has given support to the US led coalition to fight terrorism  with bilateral cooperation in counter terrorism and counter proliferation initiatives  and joint military exercises  Relations with the United States have expanded in other areas  and the two countries take part in joint policy dialogues  72  Relations with the People s Republic of China were established in the 1970s  and since then the two countries have enjoyed a strong relationship  being major players in strengthening the ASEAN China relationship  116  Singapore has also co created the Sino Singapore Tianjin Eco city and Suzhou Industrial Park in China  Singapore sees the United States as a counterweight to balance China s rise in the region  and has encouraged more American involvement and presence in the region to maintain peace and security  112  Military Main article  Singapore Armed Forces CARAT SINGAPORE 2010  Republic of Singapore Navy s RSS Steadfast and RSS Vigilance sailing line abreast  The Singaporean military is arguably the most technologically advanced in Southeast Asia  117  It comprises the Army  Navy  and Air Force  6  It is seen as the guarantor of the country s independence  118  The nation s philosophy of defence is one of diplomacy and deterrence  119  This principle translates into the culture  involving all citizens in the country s defence  120  The government spends 4 9  of the country s GDP on the military 6  and one out of every four dollars of government spending is spent on defence  121  On independence  Singapore had two infantry regiments commanded by British officers  This force was considered too small to provide effective security to the new country  so the development of the military became a priority  Britain pulled its military out of Singapore in October 1971  leaving behind only a small British  Australian and New Zealand force as a token military presence  The last British soldier left Singapore in March 1976  New Zealand troops were the last to leave  in 1989  122  123  The Singaporean army was initially established with help from Britain and Israel  a country that is not recognised by neighbouring Islamic Malaysia  Indonesia or Brunei  124  125  126  The main fear after independence was an invasion by Malaysia and or Indonesia  Israel Defense Forces commanders were tasked with creating the Singapore Armed Forces from scratch  and Israeli instructors were brought in to train Singaporean soldiers  Military courses were conducted according to the

security ties with Israel and is one of the biggest buyers of Israeli arms and weapons systems  127  The MATADOR is one example of recent Singapore Israeli collaboration  citation needed  The SAF is being developed to respond to a wide range of issues  in both conventional and unconventional warfare  The Defence Science and Technology Agency is responsible for procuring resources for the military  119  The geographic restrictions of Singapore mean that the SAF must plan to fully repulse an attack  as they can not fall back and re group  The small size of the population has also affected the way the SAF has been designed  with a small active force but a large number of reserves  120  Republic of Singapore Air Force s F 15SG Strike Eagle  Peace Carvin V  training detachment at Mountain Home Air Force Base  Singapore has conscription for all able bodied males at age 18  except those with a criminal record or who can prove that their loss would bring hardship to their families  Males who have yet to complete pre university education or are awarded the Public Service Commission scholarship can opt to defer their draft  Though not required to perform military service  the number of women in the SAF has been increasing  since 1989 they have been allowed to fill military vocations formerly reserved for men  Before induction into a specific branch of the armed forces  recruits undergo at least 9 weeks of basic military training  128  Because of the scarcity of open land on the main island  training involving activities such as live firing and amphibious landings is often carried out on smaller islands  typically barred to civilian access  This also avoids risk to the main island and the city  However  large scale drills are considered too dangerous to be performed in the area  and since 1975 have been performed in Taiwan  128  Training is also held in about a dozen other countries  In general  military exercises are held with foreign forces once or twice per week  120  Due to airspace and land constraints  the Republic of Singapore Air Force  RSAF  maintains a number of overseas bases in Australia  the United States  and France  The RSAF s 130 Squadron is based in RAAF Base Pearce  Western Australia  129  and its 126 Squadron is based in the Oakey Army Aviation Centre  Queensland  130  The RSAF has one squadron   the 150 Squadron   based in Cazaux Air Base in southern France  131  132  The RSAF also has a few overseas detachments in the United States  in San Diego  California  Marana  Arizona  Grand Prairie  Texas and Luke Air Force Base  among others  133  134  The SAF has sent forces to assist in operations outside the country in areas such as Iraq 135  and Afghanistan  136  in both military and civilian roles  In the region  it has helped stabilise East Timor and has provided aid to Aceh in Indonesia following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami  The SAF also helped in relief efforts during Hurricane Katrina  137  Singapore is part of the Five Power Defence Arrangements  a military alliance with Australia  Malaysia  New Zealand  and the United Kingdom  120  Demographics Main article  Demographics of Singapore As of 2011 update   the population of Singapore is 5 18 million people  of whom 3 25 million  63   are citizens while the rest  37   are permanent residents or foreign workers  Twenty three percent of Singaporean citizens were born outside Singapore i e  foreign born citizens  There are half a million permanent residents in Singapore in 2011  The resident population does not take into account the 11 million transient visitors who visit Singapore annually  4  138  139  The median age of Singaporeans is 37 years old and the average household size is 3 5 persons  Due to scarcity of land  four out of five Singaporeans live in subsidised  high rise  public housing apartments known as HDB  Housing and Development Board  flats  after the board responsible for public housing in the country  140  In 2010  three quarters of Singaporean residents live in properties that are equal to or larger than a four room HDB flat or in private housing  House ownership rate is at 87 2   141  142 Mobile phone penetration rate is extremely high at 1 400 mobile phone subscribers per 1000 people  Around 1 in 10 residents owns a car  139  In 2010  the total fertility rate was 1 1 children per woman  the third lowest in the world and well below the 2 1 needed to replace the population  6  To overcome this problem  the Singapore government has been encouraging foreigners to immigrate to Singapore for the past few decades  The large number of immigrants has kept Singapore s population from declining  143  Singapore traditionally has one of the lowest unemployment rate among developed countries  Singaporean unemployment rate has not exceeded 4  in the past decade  hitting a high of 3  during the 2009 global financial criss and falling to 1 9  in 2011  144  145  As of 2009 update   about 40  of Singapore s residents were foreigners  one of the highest percentage in the world  146  The government is considering capping these workers  although it is recognised that they are crucial to the country s economy  147  as foreign workers make up 80  of the construction industry and up to 50  in the service industry  148  149  In 2009  the government census reports that 74 2  of residents were of Chinese  13 4  of Malay  and 9 2  of Indian descent  150  while Eurasians and other groups form 3 2   Prior to 2010  each person could register as a member of only one race  by default that of his or her father  therefore  mixed race persons were solely grouped under their father s race in government censuses  From 2010 onward  people may register using a  double barrelled  classification  in which they may choose one primary race and one secondary race  but no more than two  151  Religion Main article  Religion in Singapore Religion in Singapore 152  religion percentage Buddhism    33  Christianity    18  No religion    17  Islam    15  Taoism    11  Hinduism    5 1  Others    0 9  Buddhism is the most widely practised religion in Singapore  with 33  of the resident population declaring themselves adherents at the most recent census  The next largest religious demographics  in order of size  are Christianity  non religious  Islam  Taoism and Hinduism  The proportion of Christians  Taoists and non religious people increased between 2000 and 2010 by about 3  each  while the proportion of Buddhists decreased  Other faiths remained largely stable in their share of the population  152  There are monasteries and Dharma centres from all three major traditions of Buddhism in Singapore  Theravada  Mahayana  and Vajrayana  Most Buddhists in Singapore are Chinese and are of the Mahayana tradition  153  Chinese Mahayana is the most predominant form of Buddhism in Singapore  with missionaries from Taiwan and China for several decades  However  Thailand s Theravada Buddhism has seen growing popularity among the people  not only the Chinese  in the past decade  Soka Gakkai International  a Japanese Buddhist organisation  is practised by many people in Singapore  but by mostly those of Chinese descent  Tibetan Buddhism has also made slow inroads into the country in recent years  154  Languages Main article  Languages of Singapore Native languages of Singaporeans 155  language   of first language speakers Chinese    49 9  English    32 3  Malay    12 2  Tamil    3 3  Singapore has four official languages  English  Chinese  Malay  and Tamil  156  English is the common language of the nation and is the language of business  government and medium of instruction in schools  157  158 Public bodies in Singapore conduct their businesses in English  and official documents written in a non English official language such as Chinese  Malay or Tamil typically have to be translated into English to be accepted for submission  The Singapore Constitution and all laws are written in English  159  and translators are also required if one wishes to address the Singaporean Courts in a language other than English  160  161  However  English is the native tongue for only one third of all Singaporeans  with roughly a third of all Singaporean Chinese  a quarter of all Singaporean Malays and half of all Singaporean Indians speaking it as their native tongue  Twenty percent of Singaporeans  or one out of every five  are illiterate in English  162  Many  but not all  Singaporeans are bilingual in English and another official language  with vastly varying degrees of fluency  The various official languages ranked in terms of literacy amongst Singaporeans are  English  80  literacy   Mandarin Chinese  65  literacy   Malay  17  literacy  and Tamil  4  literacy   152  163 Singaporean English is based on British English  164  and forms of English spoken range from Standard English to a pidgin known as  Singlish   Singlish is heavily discouraged by the government  165  Chinese is the language which is spoken by most Singaporeans as their native tongue half of all Singaporeans speak it as their native tongue  155 Singaporean Mandarin is the most common version of Chinese in the country  166  with 1 2 million using it as their home language  Nearly half a million speak other Chinese languages  which the government describes as  dialects    mainly Hokkien  Teochew  and Cantonese  as their home language  although the use of these is declining in favour of Mandarin and English  167  Malay is the  national language   a ceremonial rather than functional designation to reflect the country s history  156  168  169  It is used in the national anthem  Majulah Singapura  170  and in military commands  Today  in general Malay is spoken within the Singaporean Malay community  with only 16 8  of all Singaporeans literate in Malay 171  and only 12  using it as their native language  155  Around 100 000 or 3  of Singaporeans speak Tamil as their native language  155  Even though only Tamil has official status  there have been no attempts to discourage the use or spread of other Indian languages  172  Education Main article  Education in Singapore The Administrative Building of Nanyang Technological University  one of five public universities in Singapore Education for primary  secondary  and tertiary levels is mostly supported by the state  All institutions  private and public  must be registered with the Ministry of Education  173  English is the language of instruction in all public schools 174  and all subjects are taught and examined in English except for the  Mother Tongue  language paper  175  While  Mother Tongue  in general refers to the first language internationally  in Singapore s education system  it is used to refer to the second language  as English is the first language  176  177  Students who have been abroad for a while or who struggle with their  Mother Tongue  language are allowed to take a simpler syllabus or drop the subject  178  179  Education takes place in three stages   Primary education    Secondary education   and  Pre university education   of which only the Primary level is compulsory  Students begin with six years of primary school  which is made up of a four year foundation course and a two year orientation stage  The curriculum is focused on the development of English  the mother tongue  and maths  180  There are four standard subjects taught to all students  English  the mother tongue  mathematics  and science  181  Secondary school lasts from four to five years  and is divided between  Special    Express    Normal  Academic    and  Normal  Technical   streams within each school  depending on a student s ability level  182  The basic coursework breakdown is the same as in the primary level  although classes are much more specialised  183  Pre university education takes place over two to three years at senior schools mostly called Junior Colleges  184  Some schools have a degree of freedom in their curriculum  and are known as autonomous schools  These exist from the secondary education level  182  Educational attainment of non student Singaporeans above 15 years old in 2005 185  Highest qualification Percentage No education    18  Primary school    45  Secondary school    15  Post secondary diploma    8  Degree    14  National examinations are standardised across all schools  with a test taken after each stage of school  After the first six years of education  students take the Primary School Leaving Examination  180  which determines their placement at secondary school  At the end of the secondary stage  GCE  O  Level exams are taken  at the end of the following pre university stage  the GCE  A  Level exams are taken  Of all non student Singaporeans aged 15 and above  18  have no educational qualifications at all while 45  have the Primary School Leaving Examination as their highest qualification  15  have the GCE  O  Level as their highest qualification and 14  have a degree  185  Singaporean students consistently rank top five in the world in the two major international assessments of mathematics and science knowledge  Singaporean students were ranked first in the latest Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement and have been ranked top three every year since 1995  186  187  Singaporean students were also ranked top five in the world in terms of mathematics  science and reading in the 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment conducted by the OECD  188  The country s two main public universities   the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University   are among the top 100 universities in the world  189  Health Main article  Healthcare in Singapore Singapore has a generally efficient healthcare system  even with a health expenditure relatively low for developed countries  190  The World Health Organization ranks Singapore s healthcare system as 6th overall in the world in its World Health Report  191  In general  Singapore has the lowest infant mortality rate in the world for the past two decades  139  Life expectancy in Singapore is 79 for males and 83 for females  placing the country 15th in the world for life expectancy  Almost the whole population has access to improved water and sanitation facilities  There are fewer than 10 annual deaths from HIV per 100 000 people  There is a high level of immunisation  Adult obesity is below 10   192  The government s healthcare system is based upon the  3M  framework  This has three components  Medifund  which provides a safety net for those not able to otherwise afford healthcare  Medisave  a compulsory health savings scheme covering about 85  of the population  and Medishield  a government funded health insurance scheme  190  Public hospitals in Singapore have autonomy in their management decisions  and compete for patients  A subsidy scheme exists for those on low income  193  In 2008  31 9  of healthcare was funded by the government  It accounts for approximately 3 5  of Singapore s GDP  194  Culture Main article  Culture of Singapore Singapore is a very diverse and young country  It has many languages  cultures and religions for a country its size  195  Due to the many different languages and cultures in the country  there is no single set of culturally acceptable behaviours  When Singapore became independent from the United Kingdom in 1963  most of the newly minted Singaporean citizens were uneducated labourers from China  Malaysia and India  Many of them were transient labourers who were seeking to make some money in Singapore and they had no intentions of staying for good  A sizeable minority of middle class  local born people  known as the Peranakans also existed  With the exception of the Peranakans who pledged their loyalties to Singapore  most of the labourers  loyalties lie with their respective homelands of China  Malaysia and India  For instance  the Chinese wore pigtails to signify their loyalty to the Chinese emperor and remitted money to China  196  197  After independence  the process of crafting a Singaporean identity and culture began  Both the former Prime Ministers of Singapore  Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong  have stated that Singapore does not fit the traditional description of a nation  calling it a society in transition  pointing out the fact that Singaporeans do not all speak the same language  share the same religion or have the same customs  195  198  Even though English is the first language of the nation  according to the government s 2010 census 20  of Singaporeans  or one in five  are illiterate in English  This is a marked improvement from 1990 where 40  of Singaporeans were illiterate in English  199  200  Unlike many other countries  languages  religions and cultures among Singaporeans are not delineated according to skin colour or ancestry  Among Singaporean Chinese  one in five is Christian  another one in five is atheist  and the rest are mostly Buddhists or Taoists  One third speak English as their home language  while half speak Mandarin Chinese as their home language  The rest speak other mutually unintelligible Chinese languages at home  199 Singaporean Indians are much more religious  Only 1  of them are atheists  Six in ten are Hindus  two in ten Muslims  and the rest mostly Christians  Four in ten speak English as their home language  three in ten Tamil  one in ten Malay  and the rest other Indian languages as their home language  199  Each Singaporean s behaviours and attitudes would therefore be influenced by  among many other things  his or her home language and his religion  Singaporeans who speak English as their native language tend to lean toward Western Culture  While those who speak Chinese languages as their native language tend to lean toward Chinese culture and Confucianism  Malay speaking Singaporeans tend to lean toward Malay culture  which itself is closely linked to Islamic culture  Those who speak Indian languages as their native language would probably lean toward Indian culture  Singapore  as a country  in general is conservative socially  but some liberalisation has occurred  201  At the national level  meritocracy  where one is judged based on one s ability  is heavily emphasised  202  Racial and religious harmony is regarded by the government as a crucial part of Singapore s success and played a part in building a Singaporean identity  203  Singapore has a reputation as a nanny state  204  205  The national flower of Singapore is the Vanda Miss Joaquim  Many national symbols such as the National Coat of Arms and the Lion Head symbol make use of the lion  as Singapore is known as the  Lion City   Public holidays in Singapore cover major Chinese  Western  Malay and Indian festivals  206  Due to scarcity of land  four out of five Singaporeans live in subsidised  high rise  public housing apartments known as HDB  for Housing and Development Board  flats  140  Singaporeans generally take off their shoes before entering their homes  207  Live in domestic helpers are quite common in Singapore and there are nearly 200 000 domestic helpers there  208  As with most Commonwealth countries  vehicles on the road and people walking on the streets keep to the left  209  Unlike some Western countries and ASEAN countries in the Golden Triangle  Singapore does not have a culture of recreational drug use  The country has strict laws against drug use and has one of the lowest rates of drug use in the world  210  Singaporean employees work an average of around 45 hours weekly  relatively long compared to many other nations  Three in four Singaporean employees surveyed stated that they take pride in doing their work well  and that doing so helps their self confidence  211  Foreigners also make up 42  of the population 146  167  and have a strong influence on Singaporean culture  A T  Kearney named Singapore the most globalised country in the world in 2006 in its Globalization Index  212  The Economist Intelligence Unit in its  Quality of Life Index  ranks Singapore as having the best quality of life in Asia and eleventh overall in the world  213  Cuisine Main article  Singaporean cuisine Dining  along with shopping  is said to be the country s national pastime  214  The diversity of food is touted as a reason to visit the country  215  and the variety of food representing different ethnicities is seen by the government as a symbol of its multiculturalism  216  The  national fruit  of Singapore is the durian  217  In popular culture  food items belong to a particular ethnicity  with Chinese  Indian  and Malay food clearly defined  The diversity of cuisine has been increased further by the  hybridization  of different styles  e g  the Peranakan style  a mix of Chinese and Malay cuisine  215  Arts The durian shaped Esplanade  performing arts centre  stands out in front of the Marina Square area  Since the 1990s  the government has been promoting Singapore as a centre for arts and culture  in particular the performing arts  and to transform the country into a cosmopolitan  gateway between the East and West   218  One highlight was the construction of Esplanade   Theatres on the Bay  a performing arts centre opened in October 2002  219  The national orchestra  Singapore Symphony Orchestra  plays at the Esplanade  The annual Singapore Arts Festival is organised by the National Arts Council  The stand up comedy scene has been growing  with a weekly open mic  220  Singapore hosted the 2009 Genee International Ballet Competition  a classical ballet competition promoted by London s Royal Academy of Dance  221  Sport and recreation Main article  Sport in Singapore   The template below  Wide image  is being considered for merging  See templates for discussion

Circuit and became the first night race on the F1 circuit 226  and the first street circuit in Asia  227  Singapore hosted the inaugural 2010 Summer Youth Olympics  228  Media Main article  Media of Singapore Companies linked to the government control much of the domestic media in Singapore  229 MediaCorp operates most free to air television channels and free to air radio stations in Singapore  There are a total of seven free to air TV channels offered by Mediacorp  230  The channels are Channel 5  English channel   Channel News Asia  English channel   Okto  English channel   Channel 8

232  and Singtel s MioTV provides an IPTV service  233 Singapore Press Holdings  a body with close links to the government  controls most of the newspaper industry  234  Singapore s media industry has sometimes been criticised for being too regulated and lacking in freedom by human rights groups such as Freedom House  229  In 2010  Reporters Without Borders  a France based international non governmental organisation  ranked Singapore 136 out of 178 in its Press Freedom Index  just below Mexico  235  The Media Development Authority regulates Singaporean media  claiming to balance the demand for choice and protection against offensive and harmful material  236  Private ownership of TV satellite dishes is banned  234  There are 3 4 million users of the internet in Singapore  234  one of the highest internet penetration rates in the world  The Singapore government does not engage in widespread censoring of the internet  237  but it maintains a list of one hundred websites  mostly pornographic  that it blocks as a  symbolic statement of the Singaporean community s stand on harmful and undesirable content on the Internet   238  As the block only covers only home Internet access  users can still visit the blocked websites from their office computers  239  Transport Main article  Transport in Singapore The Port of Singapore with Sentosa island in the background Singapore is a small island with a high population density  therefore  there is a need to restrict the number of private cars on the road  Car buyers must pay for duties one and a half times the vehicle s market value and bid for a Singaporean Certificate of Entitlement  COE   which allows the car to run on the road for a decade  The cost of the Singaporean certificate of entitlement alone would often allow one to buy a Porsche Boxster in the United States  Car prices are generally significantly higher in Singapore when compared to other English speaking countries and thus only 1 in 10 residents own a car  139  240  Electronic Road Pricing gantry at North Bridge Road Most Singaporean residents travel by foot  bicycles  bus  taxis and by train  Mass Rapid Transit   Two companies run the public bus transport system   SBS Transit and SMRT Corporation  SMRT also runs the public train system  There are almost a dozen taxi companies in Singapore who together put out 25 000 taxis on the road  Taxis are a popular form of public transport as the fares are relatively cheap compared to many other developed countries  241  242  Singapore has a road system covering 3 356 kilometres  2 085 mi   which includes 161 kilometres  100 mi  of expressways  6  243  244  The Singapore Area Licensing Scheme  implemented in 1975  became the world s first congestion pricing scheme  and included other complementary measures such as stringent car ownership quotas and improvements in mass transit  245  246  Upgraded in 1998 and renamed Electronic Road Pricing  the system introduced electronic toll collection  electronic detection  and video surveillance technology  247  Singapore is a major international transport hub in Asia  positioned on many sea and air trade routes  The Port of Singapore  managed by port operators PSA International and Jurong Port  was the world s second busiest port in 2005 in terms of shipping tonnage handled  at 1 15 billion gross tons  and in terms of containerised traffic  at 23 2 million twenty foot equivalent units  TEUs   It is also the world s second busiest  behind Shanghai  in terms of cargo tonnage with 423 million tons handled  In addition
