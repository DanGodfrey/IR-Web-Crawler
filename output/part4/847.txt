Generation One is a retroactive term for the Transformers characters that appeared between 1984 and 1993  The Transformers began with the 1980s Japanese toy lines Microman and Diaclone  The former utilized varying humanoid type figures while the latter presented robots able to transform into everyday vehicles  electronic items or weapons  Hasbro  fresh from the success of the G I  Joe  A Real American Hero toyline  which used the Microman technology to great success  bought the Diaclone toys  and partnered with Takara  3 Jim Shooter and Dennis O Neil were hired by Hasbro to create the backstory  O Neil also the created the name  Optimus Prime   4  Afterwards  Bob Budiansky created most of the Transformers characters  giving names and personalities to many unnamed Diaclone figures  5  The primary concept of G1 is that the heroic Optimus Prime  the villainous Megatron  and their finest soldiers crash land on pre historic Earth in the Ark and the Nemesis before awakening in 1985  Cybertron hurtling through the Neutral zone as an effect of the war  The Marvel comic was originally part of the main Marvel Universe  with appearances from Spider Man and Nick Fury  plus some cameos  6  as well as a visit to the Savage Land  7  The Transformers TV series began around the same time  Produced by Sunbow Productions and Marvel Productions  later Hasbro Productions  from the start it contradicted Budiansky s backstories  The TV series shows the Autobots looking for new energy sources  and crash landing as the Decepticons attack  8  Marvel interpreted the Autobots as destroying a rogue asteroid approaching Cybertron  9 Shockwave is loyal to Megatron in the TV series  keeping Cybertron in a stalemate during his absence  10  but in the comic book he attempts to take command of the Decepticons  11  The TV series would also differ wildly from the origins Budiansky had created for the Dinobots  12  13  the Decepticon turned Autobot Jetfire 14   known as Skyfire on TV 15    the Constructicons  who combine to form Devastator   16  17  and Omega Supreme  16  18  The Marvel comic establishes early on that Prime wields the Creation Matrix  which gives life to machines  In the second season  the two part episode The Key to Vector Sigma introduced the ancient Vector Sigma computer  which served the same original purpose as the Creation Matrix  giving life to Transformers   and its guardian Alpha Trion  In 1986  the cartoon became the film The Transformers  The Movie  which is set in the year 2005  It introduced the Matrix as the  Autobot Matrix of Leadership   as a fatally wounded Prime gives it to Ultra Magnus  however  as Prime dies he drops the matrix  which is then caught by Hot Rod who subsequently becomes Rodimus Prime later on in the film  Unicron  a transformer who devours planets  fears its power and recreates a heavily damaged Megatron as Galvatron  as well as Bombshell becoming Cyclonus  one of the Seekers becoming Scourge and two other Insecticons becoming Scourge s huntsmen  the Sweeps  Eventually  Rodimus Prime takes out the Matrix and destroys Unicron  19  In the United Kingdom  the weekly comic book interspliced original material to keep up with U S  reprints  20  and The Movie provided much new material  Writer Simon Furman proceeded to expand the continuity with movie spin offs involving the time travelling Galvatron  21  22  The Movie also featured guest voices from Leonard Nimoy as Galvatron  Scatman Crothers as Jazz  Casey Kasem as Cliffjumper  Orson Welles as Unicron and Eric Idle as the leader of the Junkions  Wreck Gar  though unnamed in the movie   The Transformers theme tune for the film was performed by Lion with  Weird Al  Yankovic adding a song to the soundtrack  The third season followed up The Movie film  with the revelation of the Quintessons having used Cybertron as a factory  Their robots rebel  and in time the workers become the Autobots and the soldiers become the Decepticons  It is the Autobots who develop transformation  23  Due to popular demand  24  Optimus Prime is resurrected at the conclusion of the third season  25  and the series ended with a three episode story arc  However  the Japanese broadcast of the series was supplemented with a newly produced OVA  Scramble City  before creating entirely new series to continue the storyline  ignoring the 1987 end of the American series  The extended Japanese run consisted of The Headmasters  Super God Masterforce  Victory and Zone  then in illustrated magazine form as Battlestars  Return of Convoy and Operation  Combination  Just as the TV series was wrapping up  Marvel continued to expand its continuity  It followed The Movie s example by killing Prime 26  and Megatron  27  albeit in the present day  Dinobot leader Grimlock takes over as Autobot leader  28  There was a G I  Joe crossover 29  and the limited series The Transformers  Headmasters  which further expanded the scope to the planet Nebulon  30  It led on to the main title resurrecting Prime as a Powermaster  31  In the United Kingdom  the mythology continued to grow  Primus was introduced as the creator of the Transformers  to serve his material body that is planet Cybertron and fight his nemesis Unicron  32  Female Autobot Arcee also appeared  despite the comic book stating the Transformers had no concept of gender  with her backstory of being built by the Autobots to quell human accusations of sexism  33 Soundwave  Megatron s second in command  also broke the fourth wall in the letters page  criticising the cartoon continuity as an inaccurate representation of history  34  The UK also had a crossover in Action Force  the UK counterpart to G I  Joe  35  The comic book featured a resurrected Megatron  36  whom Furman retconned to be a clone 37  when he took over the U S  comic book  which depicted Megatron as still dead  38  The U S  comic would last for 80 issues until 1991  39  and the UK comic lasted 332 issues and several annuals  Until it will be replaced into as Dreamwave Productions type  later in after the 20th Century  In 2009  Shout  Factory released the entire G1 series in a 16 DVD box set called the Matrix of Leadership Edition  They also released the same content as individual seasons   edit  Transformers  Generation 2  1993 1995  Main article  Transformers  Generation 2 It was five issues 40  of the GI Joe comic in 1993 that would springboard a return for Marvel s Transformers  with the new twelve issue series Transformers  Generation 2  to market a new toy line  This story revealed that the Transformers originally breed asexually  though it is stopped by Primus as it produced the evil Swarm  41  A new empire  neither Autobot nor Decepticon  is bringing it back  however  Though the year long arc wrapped itself up with an alliance between Optimus Prime and Megatron  the final panel introduced the Liege Maximo  ancestor of the Decepticons  42  This minor cliffhanger was not resolved until 2001 and 2002 s Transforce convention when writer Simon Furman concluded his story in the exclusive novella Alignment  43   edit  Beast Wars Machines  1996 2000  Main articles  Transformers  Beast Wars and Beast Machines The story focused on a small group of Maximals  the new Autobots   led by Optimus Primal  and Predacons  led by Megatron  300 years after the  Great War   After a dangerous pursuit through transwarp space  both the Maximal and Predacon factions end up crash landing on a primitive  uncivilized planet similar to Earth  but with two moons and a dangerous level of Energon  which forces them to take organic beast forms in order to function without going into stasis lock  44  After writing this first episode  Bob Forward and Larry DiTillio learned of the G1 Transformers  and began to use elements of it as a historical backstory to their scripts  45  establishing Beast Wars as a part of the Generation 1 universe through numerous callbacks to both the cartoon and Marvel comic  By the end of the first season  the second moon and the Energon are revealed to have been constructed by a mysterious alien race known as the Vok  Megatron attacks Optimus Prime in a clash of generations  The destruction of the second moon releases mysterious energies that make some of the characters  transmetal  and the planet is revealed to be prehistoric Earth  leading to the discovery of the Ark  Megatron attempts to kill the original Optimus Prime  46  but at the beginning of the third season  Primal manages to preserve his spark  In the two season follow up series  Beast Machines  Cybertron is revealed to have organic origins  which Megatron attempts to stamp out  After the first season of Beast Wars  comprising 26 episodes  aired in Japan  the Japanese were faced with a problem  The second Canadian season was only 13 episodes long  not enough to warrant airing on Japanese TV  While they waited for the third Canadian season to be completed  thereby making 26 episodes in total when added to season 2   they produced two exclusive cel animated series of their own  Beast Wars II  also called Beast Wars Second  and Beast Wars Neo  to fill in the gap  Dreamwave retroactively revealed Beast Wars to be the future of their G1 universe  47  and the 2006 IDW comic book Beast Wars  The Gathering eventually confirmed the Japanese series to be canon 48  within a story set during Season 3  49  Beast Wars contained elements from both the G1 cartoon series and comics  Attributes taken from the cartoon include Transformers that were female  the appearance of Starscream  who mentions being killed off by Galvatron in  The Transformers  The Movie   and appearances of the Plasma Energy Chamber and Key to Vector Sigma  The naming of the Transformer ship  the  Ark   and reference to 1984  the year the Transformers on board were revived  and the character  Ravage being shown as intelligent  and Cybertron having an organic core were elements taken from the comics  In 2011  Shout  Factory released the complete series of Beast Wars on DVD   edit  Dreamwave Productions  2001 2005  In 2001  Dreamwave Productions began a new universe of annual comics adapted from Marvel  but also included elements of the animated  The Dreamwave stories followed the concept of the Autobots defeating the Decepticons on Earth  but their 1997 return journey to Cybertron on the Ark II 50  is destroyed by Shockwave  now ruler of the planet  51  The story follows on from there  and was told in two six issue limited series  then a ten issue ongoing series  The series also added extra complexities such as not all Transformers believing in the existence of Primus  52  corruption in the Cybertronian government that first lead Megatron to begin his war 53  and Earth having an unknown relevance to Cybertron  51  54  Three Transformers  The War Within limited series were also published  These are set at the beginning of the Great War  and identify Prime as once being a clerk named Optronix  55 Beast Wars was also retroactively stated as the future of this continuity  with the profile series More than Meets the Eye showing the Predacon Megatron looking at historical files detailing Dreamwave s characters and taking his name from the original Megatron  47  In 2004  this real life universe also inspired three novels 56  and a Dorling Kindersley guide  which focused on Dreamwave as the  true  continuity when discussing in universe elements of the characters  In a new twist  Primus and Unicron are siblings  formerly a being known as The One  Transformers  Micromasters  set after the Ark s disappearance  was also published  The real life universe was disrupted when Dreamwave went bankrupt in 2005  57  This left the Generation One story hanging and the third volume of The War Within half finished  Plans for a comic book set between Beast Wars and Beast Machines were also left unrealized  58   edit  G I  Joe crossovers  2003 onwards  Throughout the years  the G1 characters have also starred in crossovers with fellow Hasbro property G I  Joe  but whereas those crossovers published by Marvel were in continuity with their larger storyline  those released by Dreamwave and G I  Joe publisher Devil s Due Publishing occupy their own separate real life universes  In Devil s Due  the terrorist organization Cobra is responsible for finding and reactivating the Transformers  Dreamwave s version reimagines the familiar G1 and G I  Joe characters in a World War II setting  and a second limited series was released set in the present day  though Dreamwave s bankruptcy meant it was cancelled after a single issue  Devil s Due had Cobra re engineer the Transformers to turn into familiar Cobra vehicles  and released further mini series that sent the characters travelling through time  battling Serpentor and being faced with the combined menace of Cobra La and Unicron  During this time  Cobra teams up with the Decepticons  IDW Publishing has expressed interest in their own crossover  59   edit  IDW publishing  2005 onwards  Main article  The Transformers  IDW Publishing  The following year  IDW Publishing rebooted the G1 series from scratch within various limited series and one shots  This allowed long time writer of Marvel and Dreamwave comics  Simon Furman to create his own universe without continuity hindrance  similar to Ultimate Marvel  60  Furman s story depicts a Cybertron that the rogue Pretender Thunderwing destroys  61  so the Autobots and Decepticons have to infiltrate various planets for their resources  Earth comes under particular scrutiny due to a particularly potent form of energon  which Shockwave had seeded thousands of years ago  62  with the Decepticons escalating political tensions by replacing people with clones  63  The Ark origin is absent in this series  64  The continuity was also the first to acknowledge the existence of mass displacement in transformations  such as when Megatron downsizes himself into a gun  65   edit  Alternative stories In January 2006  the Hasbro Transformers Collectors  Club comic wrote a story based on the Transformers Classics toy line  set in the Marvel Comics universe  but excluding the Generation 2 comic  Fifteen years after Megatron crash lands in the Ark with Ratchet  the war continues with the characters in their Classics bodies  66  IDW Publishing introduced The Transformers  Evolutions in 2006  a collection of mini series that re imagine and reinterpret the G1 characters in various ways  To date  only one miniseries has been published  Hearts of Steel  placing the characters in an Industrial Revolution era setting  The series was delayed as Hasbro did not want to confuse newcomers with too many fictional universes before the release of the live action film  67  However  IDW and the original publisher Marvel Comics announced a crossover storyline with the Avengers to coincide with the film New Avengers Transformers  68  The story is set on the borders of Symkaria and Latveria  and its fictional universe is set between the first two New Avengers storylines  as well in between the Infiltration and Escalation phase of IDW s The Transformers  69  IDW editor in chief  Chris Ryall hinted at elements of it being carried over into the main continuities  70  and that a sequel is possible  71   edit  Robots in Disguise  2000 2001   2002  Main article  Transformers  Robots in Disguise First broadcast in Japan in 2000  Robots in Disguise was a single animated series consisting of thirty nine episodes  It was exported to other countries in subsequent years  In this continuity  Megatron recreates the Decepticons as a subfaction of the Predacons on Earth  a potential reference to the return to the vehicle based characters following the previous dominance of the animal based characters of the Beast eras  It is a stand alone universe with no ties to any other Transformers fiction  though some of the characters from Robots in Disguise did eventually make appearances in Transformers  Universe  including Optimus Prime  Ultra Magnus  Side Burn and Prowl   edit  The Unicron Trilogy  2001   2002 2006  Main articles  Transformers  Armada  Transformers  Energon  and Transformers  Cybertron These three lines  with 1990s style  launched in 2002  preceded from 2001  and dubbed the  Unicron Trilogy  by Transformers designer Aaron Archer  72  are co productions between Hasbro and Takara  simultaneously released in both countries  each lasting 52 episodes  Armada followed the Autobots and Decepticons discovering the powerful Mini Cons on Earth  which are revealed by the end to be weapons of Unicron  Energon  set ten years later  followed the Autobots stopping the Decepticons from resurrecting Unicron with energon  In Japan  the series Transformers  Cybertron showed no ties to the previous two series  telling its own story  This caused continuity problems when Hasbro sold Cybertron as a follow up to Armada Energon  The writers attempted to change certain plot elements from the Japanese version to remedy this  although this largely added up to nothing more than references to Unicron  Primus  Primes and Minicons  Just as Marvel produced a companion comic to Generation One  Dreamwave Productions published the comic Transformers Armada set in a different continuity to the cartoon  At  19  it became Transformers Energon  Dreamwave went bankrupt and ceased all publications before the storyline could be completed at  30  However  the Transformers Fan Club published a few stories set in the Cybertron era  73   edit  Transformers  Universe  2003 present  Main article  Transformers  Universe The storyline of Transformers  Universe  mainly set following Beast Machines  sees characters from many assorted alternate continuities  including existing and new ones  encountering each other  The story was told in an unfinished comic book exclusive to the Official Transformers Collectors  Convention   edit  Live action film franchise  2007 present  Main article  Transformers  film series  Main articles  Transformers  film   Transformers  Revenge of the Fallen  and Transformers  Dark of the Moon In 2007  a live action film of Transformers was directed by Michael Bay and produced by Steven Spielberg  The main focus of the film revolved around the creator of the Transformers  which in the film is described as the Allspark  as well as their home planet Cybertron  The film portrayed the Allspark as a large cube of energy that can create life from mechanical objects  During the Cybertronian Civil War  the Allspark was sent off the planet and eventually landed on Earth  where it was discovered by the U S  government and the Hoover Dam was built over it as a top secret research facility and government base  Megatron searched for the Allspark and eventually found Earth  but he crash landed in the Arctic and was frozen  Many years later he was found and also brought to the same facility as the Allspark  With their homeworld ravaged by war  the Autobots were dispersed throughout space  But a group of Autobots led by Optimus Prime traveled to Earth in search of the Allspark  in an attempt to revitalize their planet  However  the Decepticons also race towards Earth to find the Allspark  as well as their leader  Megatron  The film depicts the battle over the Allspark on Earth  The Transformers are depicted as mechanical beings that can reconstruct their outside appearance through scanning or touching a mechanical object of relative size to each Transformer s body  74  Steven Spielberg  who is credited as executive producer  said that Transformers is a dream come true because  he explains  since it started marketing the Toys conceived the idea of giving them life in a summer movie   And here s the movie   he says   I must confess that I am a fan of Transformers since they left  rather than to buy them for my children  then bought the comics and toys   Spielberg  other producers had the same idea of bringing the Transformers movie  as the former studio executive Lorenzo DiBonaventura  as well as Hasbro s chief operating officer  Brian Goldner  among others  Spielberg and his team decided to find a director with sufficient skill and experience to take on the challenge of combining a fantastic story  special effects and lots of action   I thought Michael  Bay  because I consider it perfect for Transformers  You need to touch and a clear vision of how it could be this film   says Spielberg  citation needed  To market the film  IDW Publishing published Transformers  Movie Prequel  The comic expanded upon Optimus Prime s referral to Megatron as  brother   revealing they co ruled Cybertron before Megatron s corruption  Furthermore  Optimus sent the Allspark into space in a last ditch attempt to defeat Megatron  Megatron is responsible for Bumblebee s muteness in the film  as a direct result of distracting him from the Allspark s launch  75 Alan Dean Foster also wrote the prequel novel Transformers  Ghosts of Yesterday  The novel shows that Starscream hated Megatron and wanted him to never be found  so he could remain as leader  explaining Megatron s line in the film   You failed me  yet again  Starscream   Blackout is also depicted as deeply loyal to Megatron  explaining his line  All hail Megatron   However  the novel contradicts the film with Megatron s body moved into the Hoover Dam in 1969  instead of the 1930s  76  IDW plans to continue the film s fictional universe with additional prequels and sequels  77  Transformers  Revenge of the Fallen  the sequel to the 2007 film  made its debut in theaters on June 24  2009  As a preemptive measure  Paramount and DreamWorks announced a July 1  2011 release date for a third Transformers film before completion of Revenge of the Fallen  Bay responded   I said I was taking off a year from Transformers  Paramount made a mistake in dating Transformers 3 they asked me on the phone I said yes to July 1 but for 2012 whoops  Not 2011  That would mean I would have to start prep in September  No way  My brain needs a break from fighting robots   As in Revenge of the Fallen  Orci refused to guarantee whether he and Kurtzman would return to a sequel  because  we risk getting stale   Orci has mentioned he would like to introduce Unicron  for scale s sake   The co writer also said focusing on more Triple Changers would be interesting  On October 1  2009  Michael Bay revealed that Transformers 3 had already gone into pre production  and its planned release was back to its original date of July 1  2011 instead of 2012  Also Ehren Kruger was said to be again involved in the writing  and Shia LaBeouf to reprise his roles as Sam  Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman  having written the first two films  did not return for the third installment in the series  In a hidden extra for the Blu ray version of Revenge of the Fallen  Bay expressed his intention to make Transformers 3 not necessarily larger than Revenge of the Fallen  but instead go deeper into the mythos  give it more character development  and make it darker and more emotional  The video also shows images of Unicron   edit  Transformers Animated  2007   2009   2010  Main article  Transformers Animated The Cartoon

California based online game Roblox have also arranged an event promoting the cartoon  81   edit  Official Convention and Collector s Club releases An officially recognized fan convention  usually called BotCon  has been held nearly every year since 1994  The first few conventions were organized by individual fans  but a fan made company named 3H Enterprises  later Productions  secured the license to BotCon from 1997 2002  The license was secured by a new organization named Fun Publications in 2005  who have held it ever since  Because the conventions are officially sanctioned by Hasbro  presenters have been able to produce official  limited run toys  fiction  and other merchandise for sale at BotCon  The BotCon toys have grown dramatically over the years  In 1994  a single figure was provided for attendees  In 2010  fifteen different figures were available through a collection of box sets  souvenir packages  and customization classes  Fictional contributions have also increased over the years  Prior to 2005  most conventions released a single comic  often accompanying the toys released that year  Since Fun Publications assumed the license  however  the annual BotCon comic has been supplemented by on line text stories available exclusively at the official club website  and a bi monthly magazine sent out to members with a six page comic in each issue  Grouped under the umbrella term  Transformers  Timelines   Fun Publications fiction deals with a variety of existing Transformers franchises  including Generation 1  Beast Wars and Cybertron  as well as new universes created specifically by Fun Publications such as TransTech and Shattered Glass   edit  References    A brief history of the Transformers   Malaysia Star  http   thestar com my
