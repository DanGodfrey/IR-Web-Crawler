Corporate social responsibility From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search  Corporate responsibility  redirects here  For other types of responsibility  see Responsibility  disambiguation   Corporate social responsibility  CSR  also called corporate conscience  corporate citizenship  social performance  or sustainable responsible business  Responsible Business  1  is a form of corporate self regulation integrated into a business model  CSR policy functions as a built in  self regulating mechanism whereby a business monitors and ensures its active compliance with the spirit of the law  ethical standards  and international norms  The goal of CSR is to embrace responsibility for the company s actions and encourage a positive impact through its activities on the environment  consumers  employees  communities  stakeholders and all other members of the public sphere who may also be considered as stakeholders  The term  corporate social responsibility  came into common use in the late 1960s and early 1970s after many multinational corporations formed the term stakeholder  meaning those on whom an organization s activities have an impact  It was used to describe corporate owners beyond shareholders as a result of an influential book by R  Edward Freeman  Strategic management  a stakeholder approach in 1984  2  Proponents argue that corporations make more long term profits by operating with a perspective  while critics argue that CSR distracts from the economic role of businesses  Others argue CSR is merely window dressing  or an attempt to pre empt the role of governments as a watchdog over powerful multinational corporations  CSR is titled to aid an organization s mission as well as a guide to what the company stands for and will uphold to its consumers  Development business ethics is one of the forms of applied ethics that examines ethical principles and moral or ethical problems that can arise in a business environment  ISO 26000 is the recognized international standard for CSR  Public sector organizations  the United Nations for example  adhere to the triple bottom line  TBL   It is widely accepted that CSR adheres to similar principles but with no formal act of legislation  The UN has developed the Principles for Responsible Investment as guidelines for investing entities  Contents 1 Approaches 2 Social accounting

Canadian  Montreal school of CSR   the Continental European and the Anglo Saxon approaches to CSR  3  And even within Europe the discussion about CSR is very heterogeneous  4  A more common approach of CSR is philanthropy  This includes monetary donations and aid given to local organizations and impoverished communities in developing countries  Some organizations who   do not like this approach as it does not help build on the skills of the local people  whereas community based development generally leads to more sustainable development  clarification needed Difference between local org amp  community dev  Cite  Another approach to CSR is to incorporate the CSR strategy directly into the business strategy of an organization  For instance  procurement of Fair Trade tea and coffee has been adopted by various businesses including KPMG  Its CSR manager commented   Fairtrade fits very strongly into our commitment to our communities   5  Another approach is garnering increasing corporate responsibility interest  This is called Creating Shared Value  or CSV  The shared value model is based on the idea that corporate success and social welfare are interdependent  A business needs a healthy  educated workforce  sustainable resources and adept government to compete effectively  For society to thrive  profitable and competitive businesses must be developed and supported to create income  wealth  tax revenues  and opportunities for philanthropy  CSV received global attention in the Harvard Business Review article Strategy  amp  Society  The Link between Competitive Advantage and Corporate Social Responsibility  1  by Michael E  Porter  a leading authority on competitive strategy and head of the Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness at Harvard Business School  and Mark R  Kramer  Senior Fellow at the Kennedy School at Harvard University and co founder of FSG Social Impact Advisors  The article provides insights and relevant examples of companies that have developed deep linkages between their business strategies and corporate social responsibility  Many approaches to CSR pit businesses against society  emphasizing the costs and limitations of compliance with externally imposed social and environmental standards  CSV acknowledges trade offs between short term profitability and social or environmental goals  but focuses more on the opportunities for competitive advantage from building a social value proposition into corporate strategy  Many companies use the strategy of benchmarking to compete within their respective industries in CSR policy  implementation  and effectiveness  Benchmarking involves reviewing competitor CSR initiatives  as well as measuring and evaluating the impact that those policies have on society and the environment  and how customers perceive competitor CSR strategy  After a comprehensive study of competitor strategy and an internal policy review performed  a comparison can be drawn and a strategy developed for competition with CSR initiatives   edit  Social accounting  auditing  and reporting Main article  Social accounting For a business to take responsibility for its actions  that business must be fully accountable  Social accounting  a concept describing the communication of social and environmental effects of a company s economic actions to particular interest groups within society and to society at large  is thus an important element of CSR  6  Social accounting emphasizes the notion of corporate accountability  D  Crowther defines social accounting in this sense as  an approach to reporting a firm s activities which stresses the need for the identification of socially relevant behavior  the determination of those to whom the company is accountable for its social performance and the development of appropriate measures and reporting techniques   7  An example of social accounting  to a limited extent  is found in an annual Director s Report  under the requirements of UK company law  8  A number of reporting guidelines or standards have been developed to serve as frameworks for social accounting  auditing and reporting including  AccountAbility s AA1000 standard  based on John Elkington s triple bottom line  3BL  reporting The Prince s Accounting for Sustainability Project s Connected Reporting Framework The Fair Labor Association conducts audits based on its Workplace Code of Conduct and posts audit results on the FLA website  The Fair Wear Foundation takes a unique approach to verifying labour conditions in companies  supply chains  using interdisciplinary auditing teams  Global Reporting Initiative s Sustainability Reporting Guidelines GoodCorporation s Standard developed in association with the Institute of Business Ethics Earthcheck www earthcheck org Certification   Standard Social Accountability International s SA8000 standard Standard Ethics Aei guidelines The ISO 14000 environmental management standard The United Nations Global Compact requires companies to communicate on their progress  or to produce a Communication on Progress  COP   and to describe the company s implementation of the Compact s ten universal principles  This information should be fully integrated in the participant s main medium of stakeholder communications  for example a corporate responsibility or sustainability report and or an integrated financial and sustainability report  If a company does not publish formal reports  a COP can be created as a stand alone document  9  The United Nations Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting  ISAR  provides voluntary technical guidance on eco efficiency indicators  corporate responsibility reporting  and corporate governance disclosure  The FTSE Group publishes the FTSE4Good Index  an evaluation of CSR performance of companies  In some nations  legal requirements for social accounting  auditing and reporting exist  e g  in the French bilan social   though international or national agreement on meaningful measurements of social and environmental performance is difficult  Many companies now produce externally audited annual reports that cover Sustainable Development and CSR issues   Triple Bottom Line Reports    but the reports vary widely in format  style  and evaluation methodology  even within the same industry   Critics dismiss these reports as lip service  citing examples such as Enron s yearly  Corporate Responsibility Annual Report  and tobacco corporations  social reports  In South Africa  as of June 2010  all companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange  JSE  were required to produce an integrated report in place of an annual financial report and sustainability report  10  An integrated report includes environmental  social and economic performance alongside financial performance information and is expected to provide users with a more holistic overview of a company  However  this requirement was implemented in the absence of any formal or legal standards for an integrated report  An Integrated Reporting Committee  IRC  was established to issue guidelines for good practice in this field   edit  Potential business benefits The scale and nature of the benefits of CSR for an organization can vary depending on the nature of the enterprise  and are difficult to quantify  though there is a large body of literature exhorting business to adopt measures beyond financial ones  e g   Deming s Fourteen Points  balanced scorecards   Orlitzky  Schmidt  and Rynes 11  found a correlation between social environmental performance and financial performance  However  businesses may not be looking at short run financial returns when developing their CSR strategy  The definition of CSR used within an organization can vary from the strict  stakeholder impacts  definition used by many CSR advocates and will often include charitable efforts and volunteering  CSR may be based within the human resources  business development or public relations departments of an organisation  12  or may be given a separate unit reporting to the CEO or in some cases directly to the board  Some companies may implement CSR type values without a clearly defined team or programme  The business case for CSR 13  within a company will likely rest on one or more of these arguments   edit  Human resources A CSR program can be an aid to recruitment and retention  14  particularly within the competitive graduate student market  Potential recruits often ask about a firm s CSR policy during an interview  and having a comprehensive policy can give an advantage  CSR can also help improve the perception of a company among its staff  particularly when staff can become involved through payroll giving  fundraising activities or community volunteering  CSR has been found to encourage customer orientation among frontline employees  15   edit  Risk management Managing risk is a central part of many corporate strategies  Reputations that take decades to build up can be ruined in hours through incidents such as corruption scandals or environmental accidents  16  These can also draw unwanted attention from regulators  courts  governments and media  Building a genuine culture of  doing the right thing  within a corporation can offset these risks  17   edit  Brand differentiation In crowded marketplaces  companies strive for a unique selling proposition that can separate them from the competition in the minds of consumers  CSR can play a role in building customer loyalty based on distinctive ethical values  18  Several major brands  such as The Co operative Group  The Body Shop and American Apparel 19  are built on ethical values  Business service organizations can benefit too from building a reputation for integrity and best practice   edit  License to operate Corporations are keen to avoid interference in their business through taxation or regulations  By taking substantive voluntary steps  they can persuade governments and the wider public that they are taking issues such as health and safety  diversity  or the environment seriously as good corporate citizens with respect to labour standards and impacts on the environment   edit  Criticisms and concerns Critics of CSR as well as proponents debate a number of concerns related to it  These include CSR s relationship to the fundamental purpose and nature of business and questionable motives for engaging in CSR  including concerns about insincerity and hypocrisy   edit  Nature of business Milton Friedman and others have argued that a corporation s purpose is to maximize returns to its shareholders  and that since only people can have social responsibilities  corporations are only responsible to their shareholders and not to society as a whole  Although they accept that corporations should obey the laws of the countries within which they work  they assert that corporations have no other obligation to society  Some people perceive CSR as in congruent with the very nature and purpose of business  and indeed a hindrance to free trade  Those who assert that CSR is contrasting with capitalism and are in favor of the free market argue that improvements in health  longevity and or infant mortality have been created by economic growth attributed to free enterprise  20  Critics of this argument perceive the free market as opposed to the well being of society and a hindrance to human freedom  They claim that the type of capitalism practiced in many developing countries is a form of economic and cultural imperialism  noting that these countries usually have fewer labour protections  and thus their citizens are at a higher risk of exploitation by multinational corporations  21  A wide variety of individuals and organizations operate in between these poles  For example  the REALeadership Alliance asserts that the business of leadership  be it corporate or otherwise  is to change the world for the better  22  Many religious and cultural traditions hold that the economy exists to serve human beings  so all economic entities have an obligation to society  see for example Economic Justice for All   Moreover  as discussed above  many CSR proponents point out that CSR can significantly improve long term corporate profitability because it reduces risks and inefficiencies while offering a host of potential benefits such as enhanced brand reputation and employee engagement   edit  Motives Some critics believe that CSR programs are undertaken by companies such as British American Tobacco  BAT   23  the petroleum giant BP  well known for its high profile advertising campaigns on environmental aspects of its operations   and McDonald s  see below  to distract the public from ethical questions posed by their core operations  They argue that some corporations start CSR programs for the commercial benefit they enjoy through raising their reputation with the public or with government  They suggest that corporations which exist solely to maximize profits are unable to advance the interests of society as a whole  24  Another concern is that sometimes companies claim to promote CSR and be committed to sustainable development but simultaneously engage in harmful business practices  For example  since the 1970s  the McDonald s Corporation s association with Ronald McDonald House has been viewed as CSR and relationship marketing  More recently  as CSR has become mainstream  the company has beefed up its CSR programs related to its labor  environmental and other practices 25  All the same  in McDonald s Restaurants v Morris  amp  Steel  Lord Justices Pill  May and Keane ruled that it was fair comment to say that McDonald s employees worldwide  do badly in terms of pay and conditions  26  and true that  if one eats enough McDonald s food  one s diet may well become high in fat etc   with the very real risk of heart disease   27  Royal Dutch Shell has a much publicized CSR policy and was a pioneer in triple bottom line reporting  but this did not prevent the 2004 scandal concerning its misreporting of oil reserves  which seriously damaged its reputation and led to charges of hypocrisy  Since then  the Shell Foundation has become involved in many projects across the world  including a partnership with Marks and Spencer  UK  in three flower and fruit growing communities across Africa  Critics concerned with corporate hypocrisy and insincerity generally suggest that better governmental and international regulation and enforcement  rather than voluntary measures  are necessary to ensure that companies behave in a socially responsible manner  A major area of necessary international regulation is the reduction of the capacity of corporations to sue states under investor state dispute settlement provisions in trade or investment treaties if otherwise necessary public health or environment protection legislation has impeded corporate investments  28  Others  such as Patricia Werhane  argue that CSR should be considered more as a corporate moral responsibility  and limit the reach of CSR by focusing more on direct impacts of the organization as viewed through a systems perspective to identify stakeholders  For a commonly overlooked motive for CSR  see also Corporate Social Entrepreneurship  whereby CSR can also be driven by employees  personal values  in addition to the more obvious economic and governmental drivers   edit  Ethical consumerism The rise in popularity of ethical consumerism over the last two decades can be linked to the rise of CSR  As global population increases  so does the pressure on limited natural resources required to meet rising consumer demand  Grace and Cohen 2005  147   Industrialization  in many developing countries  is booming as a result of both technology and globalization  Consumers are becoming more aware of the environmental and social implications of their day to day consumer decisions and are therefore beginning to make purchasing decisions related to their environmental and ethical concerns  29  However  this practice is far from consistent or universal   edit  Globalization and market forces As corporations pursue growth through globalization  they have encountered new challenges that impose limits to their growth and potential profits  Government regulations  tariffs  environmental restrictions and varying standards of what constitutes  labor exploitation  are problems that can cost organizations millions of dollars  Some view ethical issues as simply a costly hindrance  while some companies use CSR methodologies as a strategic tactic to gain public support for their presence in global markets  helping them sustain a competitive advantage by using their social contributions to provide a subconscious level of advertising   Fry  Keim  Meiners 1986  105  Global competition places a particular pressure on multinational corporations to examine not only their own labor practices  but those of their entire supply chain  from a CSR perspective   edit  Social awareness and education The role among corporate stakeholders is to work collectively to pressure corporations that are changing  Shareholders and investors themselves  through socially responsible investing are exerting pressure on corporations to behave responsibly  Non governmental organizations are also taking an increasing role  leveraging the power of the media and the Internet to increase their scrutiny and collective activism around corporate behavior  Through education and dialogue  the development of community awareness in holding businesses responsible for their actions is growing  30  In recent years  the traditional conception of CSR is being challenged by the more community conscious Creating Shared Value concept  CSV   and several companies are refining their collaboration with stakeholders accordingly   edit  Ethics training The rise of ethics training inside corporations  some of it required by government regulation  is another driver credited with changing the behavior and culture of corporations  The aim of such training is to help employees make ethical decisions when the answers are unclear  Tullberg believes that humans are built with the capacity to cheat and manipulate  a view taken from  Trivers 1971  1985   hence the need for learning normative values and rules in human behavior  31  The most direct benefit is reducing the likelihood of  dirty hands   Grace and Cohen 2005   fines and damaged reputations for breaching laws or moral norms  Organizations also see secondary benefit in increasing employee loyalty and pride in the organization  Caterpillar and Best Buy are examples of organizations that have taken such steps  32  Increasingly  companies are becoming interested in processes that can add visibility to their CSR policies and activities  One method that is gaining increasing popularity is the use of well grounded training programs  where CSR is a major issue  and business simulations can play a part in this  citation needed  One relevant documentary is The Corporation  the history of organizations and their growth in power is discussed  Corporate social responsibility  what a company does in trying to benefit society  versus corporate moral responsibility  CMR   what a company should morally do  are both important topics to consider when looking at ethics in CSR  For example  Ray Anderson  in The Corporation  takes a CMR perspective in order to do what is moral and he begins to shift his company s focus towards the biosphere by utilizing carpets in sections so that they will sustain for longer periods  This is Anderson thinking in terms of Garret Hardin s  The Tragedy of the Commons   where if people do not pay attention to the private ways in which we use public resources  people will eventually lose those public resources   edit  Laws and regulation Another driver of CSR is the role of independent mediators  particularly the government  in ensuring that corporations are prevented from harming the broader social good  including people and the environment  CSR critics such as Robert Reich argue that governments should set the agenda for social responsibility by the way of laws and regulation that will allow a business to conduct themselves responsibly  The issues surrounding government regulation pose several problems  Regulation in itself is unable to cover every aspect in detail of a corporation s operations  This leads to burdensome legal processes bogged down in interpretations of the law and debatable grey areas  Sacconi 2004   For example  General Electric failed to clean up the Hudson River after contaminating it with organic pollutants  The company continues to argue via the legal process on assignment of liability  while the cleanup remains stagnant   Sullivan  amp  Schiafo 2005   The second issue is the financial burden that regulation can place on a nation s economy  This view shared by Bulkeley  who cites the Australian federal government s actions to avoid compliance with the Kyoto Protocol in 1997  on the concerns of economic loss and national interest  The Australian government took the position that signing the Kyoto Pact would have caused more significant economic losses for Australia than for any other OECD nation  Bulkeley 2001  pg 436   On the change of government following the election in November 2007  Prime Minister Kevin Rudd signed the ratification immediately after assuming office on 3 December 2007  just before the meeting of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change  Critics of CSR also point out that organisations pay taxes to government to ensure that society and the environment are not adversely affected by business activities  Denmark has a law on CSR  On 16 December 2008  the Danish parliament adopted a bill making it mandatory for the 1100 largest Danish companies  investors and state owned companies to include information on corporate social responsibility  CSR  in their annual financial reports  The reporting requirements became effective on 1 January 2009  33  The required information includes  information on the companies  policies for CSR or socially responsible investments  SRI  information on how such policies are implemented in practice  and information on what results have been obtained so far and managements expectations for the future with regard to CSR SRI  CSR SRI is still voluntary in Denmark  but if a company has no policy on this it must state its positioning on CSR in their annual financial report  More on the Danish law can be found at CSRgov dk  edit  Crises and their consequences Often it takes a crisis to precipitate attention to CSR  One of the most active stands against environmental management is the CERES Principles that resulted after the Exxon Valdez incident in Alaska in 1989  Grace and Cohen 2006   Other examples include the lead poisoning paint used by toy giant Mattel  which required a recall of millions of toys globally and caused the company to initiate new risk management and quality control processes  In another example  Magellan Metals in the West Australian town of Esperance was responsible for lead contamination killing thousands of birds in the area  The company had to cease business immediately and work with independent regulatory bodies to execute a cleanup  Odwalla also experienced a crisis with sales dropping 90   and the company s stock price dropping 34  due to several cases of E  coli spread through Odwalla apple juice  The company ordered a recall of all apple or carrot juice products and introduced a new process called  flash pasteurization  as well as maintaining lines of communication constantly open with customers   edit  Stakeholder priorities Increasingly  corporations are motivated to become more socially responsible because their most important stakeholders expect them to understand and address the social and community issues that are relevant to them  Understanding what causes are important to employees is usually the first priority because of the many interrelated business benefits that can be derived from increased employee engagement  i e  more loyalty  improved recruitment  increased retention  higher productivity  and so on   Key external stakeholders include customers  consumers  investors  particularly institutional investors   communities in the areas where the corporation operates its facilities  regulators  academics  and the media  Branco and Rodrigues  2007  describe the stakeholder perspective of CSR as the inclusion of all groups or constituents  rather than just shareholders  in managerial decision making related to the organization s portfolio of socially responsible activities  34  This normative model implies that the CSR collaborations are positively accepted when they are in the interests of stakeholders and may have no effect or be detrimental to the organization if they are not directly related to stakeholder interests  The stakeholder perspective suffers from a wheel and spoke network metaphor that does not acknowledge the complexity of network interactions that can occur in cross sector partnerships  It also relegates communication to a maintenance function  similar to the exchange perspective  35   edit  Arguments for Including Disability in CSR In recent years CSR is increasingly becoming a part of a large number of companies  It is becoming an important activity for businesses throughout the globe  Basically  CSR means that a company s business model should be socially responsible and environmentally sustainable  By socially responsible  it means that the company s activities should benefit the society and by environmentally sustainable it means that the activities of the company should not harm the environment  But nowadays what we can see is that there is an outburst of enthusiasm for environmental causes only  For eg  controlling pollution global warming  deforestation  mitigate carbon emissions etc  Whereas it can be said that the same enthusiasm is not seen for social welfare  This is because most of the social welfare activities of the companies contribute to the welfare of us able bodied people but do not take into account the disabled people who are also a part of the society in which the company exists and who amount to at least 10  of the population  Therefore  disability must be made a part of CSR policies of the companies and people with disabilities must be allowed to become stakeholders  There should be non discrimination or diversity management awareness raising and training for employees in the companies  that include disability treatment  They should include the disability factor in employment HR indicators  age distribution  gender  contract type  professional categories and or activity areas  rotation  so that the situation of people with disabilities can be compared with that of other employees  The companies should take into account the characteristics of people with disabilities when managing human resources  recruitment  selection  contracting and induction  promotion  training  prevention of risks at work   Customer care staff training should be carried out by the companies aimed at guaranteeing appropriate treatment of people with disabilities  They should have a policy or directive aimed at considering or favouring suppliers and subcontractors that employ people with disabilities  including Sheltered Workshops  Thus  carrying out business practice which includes disabled people will help improve the company s reputation and image in an increasingly competitive environment  Finally  disability is one of the factors that can contribute to  Diversity  and Diversity is a rising value within companies  management  However  disability is often pushed behind in favour of other diversity criteria  thus disability needs to be specifically included within the CSR   36   edit  See also Accountability Beneficiation Business in the Community Business ethics
