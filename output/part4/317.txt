locked in a room which was filled with water  However Spider Man made a web barrier filled with air  and when the door was opened he defeated the henchmen  Foswell was shot and killed while protecting Jameson  3  While Fisk was a powerful crime lord  he posed as a legitimate businessman  one who made donations to charities  and seemed like a generous  wealthy man  He eventually met a woman named Vanessa  whom he married and had a son with  Richard Fisk  Vanessa did not know that Fisk was a criminal when she married him  and when she found out  she threatened to leave him if he did not give up his life of crime  He temporarily retired from crime  and the family moved back to Japan  until the existing New York gangs lured him back to New York in hopes of getting files he was known to have on

After graduating  Richard told his parents he would travel through Europe  Only months after he left  they received news that Richard  who was angry after learning the truth about his father  had died

nonexistent  Murdock Papers  that Matt Murdock is Daredevil  Having made so many enemies who were in prison  Fisk was constantly under attack from the Hand  HYDRA  or any number of criminal

loved would be lost forever  as the woman she became got her last wish by having her husband and Daredevil constantly at war with each other all over again  Although the charges were dropped due to

effective if sprayed at close range directly into his victim s face  Due to his wealth and intellectual industry  Kingpin could use far more advanced paraphernalia  but he prefers to use such things

Kingpin actually formed an alliance with Batman and Spider Man to save the city  Ra s attempted to get his revenge by denying Fisk the cure for Vanessa s cancer  but Talia al Ghul  Ra s  daughter  provided the cure herself  recognizing in Vanessa a kindred spirit  as both of them loved men that society would regard as monsters  In the second Batman Daredevil crossover book  Kingpin almost lost

counterpart  except in one instance when he toppled a huge robot  His bodymass is stated in this continuity as being only  2  fat   a statement followed by the declared possession of  350 pounds of muscle   He s the mastermind behind the creation of the Spider Slayers and is responsible for the creation of the Insidious Six  the animated equivalent of the Sinister Six  He s also involved in a power struggle with crime boss Silvermane  Initially  he operated behind the scenes until the  Framed The Man Without Fear  two part episode  where his identity was revealed to Spider Man with the help of Daredevil  who was seeking revenge for his father s murder at Kingpin s hands  The Kingpin s main associate here was at first Alistair Smythe  but after Smythe nearly betrayed the Kingpin because he believed Kingpin was going to kill him for placing his son in jail during the Daredevil two parter  Dr  Herbert Landon replaced him  Kingpin remained at large throughout the series  although an alternate dimension s version was arrested in the series finale  Another alternate version was shown to be the lawyer of that dimension s Peter Parker  though he proved just as underhanded as his counterparts  The Kingpin has proven to be more than a match for Spider Man  eluding capture and even capturing Spider Man on occasion  This series also described an origin for the Kingpin as seen in  The man without fear   somewhat different than the comic book version  As a boy  Wilson Fisk was influenced by his father  who sought employment as a mob criminal  When older  Fisk assisted his father in robbing banks and jewelry stores  culminating in one robbery where his father escaped but Fisk  hampered by his already considerable weight  was captured by police  Fisk did not name his father at his trial and was sentenced to prison  where he resolved to survive  In adulthood  Fisk emulated his father s goal and climbed to a position of seniority within the mob  adopting the alias  Kingpin   He has had his police file destroyed  removing all record of his earlier arrest   effectively making his former life  cease to exist   He then exacted revenge against his father  who was implied to have been killed by the Kingpin s henchmen  It was also revealed that his real name was Wilson Moriarty  He maintained a strained relationship with his wife Vanessa  who was well aware of his activities and wanted him to let it all go  Though he loved her  she eventually left him after being briefly kidnapped by Silvermane  His son  Richard  works for him until he was arrested at the end of the Daredevil saga and contemplates how long until his son takes his revenge on him like he did with his father  His final appearance in in the Spider Wars saga  Kingpin appears in the Spider Man  The New Animated Series episode  Royal Scam  voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan  Here  the Kingpin manipulated Spider Man into thinking he worked for the FBI and assigned the superhero to steal a chip from the mob  they were actually innocent scientists   Spider Man soon realized he was scammed  evidenced when he learned that the first FBI agent he met is just a movie actor  and with the help of Harry Osborn and the real FBI  Spider Man had the Kingpin behind bars after a confrontation in one of the Kingpin s helicopters  When the copter crashed  both of them successfully escaped and due to Kingpin s weight  he fell from Spider Man s hand  However  the superhero saved him and had him trapped behind a crate long enough for the FBI to arrest him  In this series  the Kingpin is depicted as an African American and uses a red diamond studded cane capable of shooting lasers   edit  Film In the live action 1989 television movie The Trial of the Incredible Hulk  the Kingpin is portrayed by John Rhys Davies  David Banner  Bill Bixby  is unjustly arrested after interrupting an assault on a New York City subway by two thugs in the employ of Wilson Fisk  the Kingpin  Attorney Matt Murdock  Rex Smith  agrees to represent him  hoping to use information gleaned from Banner to bring down Fisk s organization  Banner and Murdock eventually learn about each other s secret lives as the Hulk and Daredevil  respectively  The pair is able to thwart Fisk s plans  but the Kingpin himself escapes  Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin in Daredevil  In the 2003 feature film Daredevil  Michael Clarke Duncan played the character  In the film  the Kingpin appears to be an overweight corporate head that takes the name Wilson Fisk  but in fact he is the sole person running organized crime  Duncan signed on for the role in January 2002  though he had been attached far earlier  51  When Duncan was cast  he weighed 290 pounds  He was asked to gain 40 pounds for the role in order to fit the physique of Kingpin  In order to do this  he would lift weights for 30 minutes a day  and power lifted with one or two reps a day  as well as eating whatever he wanted  Despite this  Duncan s biggest concern was that he is an African American  while Kingpin had always been portrayed as Caucasian in the comics  52  He spoke on the fans  loyalty to the source material by saying  they watch movies to say   Hey  that s not like the comic book   But I want them to get past that and just see the movie for what it is and see me for what I am an actor   53  In the film  the Kingpin started out as an enforcer for a mob boss named Falon  in which capacity he was hired to kill Jack  The Devil  Murdock after he refused to throw a fight  leaving a signature red rose at the scene of his crimes  Years later  Fisk became a crime boss in his own right and successfully hid his criminal activities from the public  although the media picked up on reports of a  Kingpin   running all crime in the city  He hires Bullseye to kill Nikolas Natchios after Natchios attempts to leave his organization  attempting to frame Natchios as the Kingpin in the process by leaving a fake paper trail  Though Bullseye is successful  Fisk also wants Natchios  family killed and hires Bullseye to kill Natchios  daughter Elektra  although Bullseye also states an interest in killing Daredevil for free after the hero made him miss a target  After he supposedly kills Elektra  Bullseye is defeated by Daredevil after he reveals during the fight that Fisk is really the Kingpin  unknowingly revealing his role in Murdock s father s death as well  Having learned of his assassin s failure  the Kingpin is prepared for the subsequent confrontation with Daredevil  severely beating the hero  expressing regret that Daredevil came to him injured rather than fighting him in his prime  before he unmasks him  learning that Daredevil is Matt Murdock  whom Fisk met prior to Nicholas Natchios  death  Daredevil nevertheless manages to trigger the sprinkler system in Fisk s office  thus allowing him to better  see  his opponent  Daredevil then breaks Fisk s legs  but refuses to kill him despite having the opportunity  having realised that he is  not the bad guy  and thus has no right to kill his foes  Daredevil leaves the Kingpin for the police and Fisk threatened to tell everyone who Daredevil really was  until the lawyer pointed out that revealing to his prison inmates that he had been beaten by a blind man was the equivalent of suicide  Nevertheless  the Kingpin swears that he will eventually get out of prison and kill Daredevil  with the hero simply responding that he will be waiting  In July 2006  Duncan showed interest in returning for the role of the Kingpin  but stated that he would not be willing to gain weight as he felt  comfortable  being down to 270 pounds  However  he jokingly showed willingness to change his mind if he was offered  20 million  Duncan suggested that the character is portrayed to have been training a lot in jail in order to become faster in combat against Daredevil  also working as a way to fit his weight loss into the story  54
