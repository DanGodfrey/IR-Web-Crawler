also known as the Federal Reserve  and informally as the Fed  is the central banking system of the United States  It was created on December 23  1913 with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act  largely in response to a series of financial panics  particularly a severe panic in 1907  2  3  4  Over time  the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System have expanded and its structure has evolved  3  5  Events such as the Great Depression were major factors leading to changes in the system  6  The Congress established three key objectives for monetary policy maximum employment  stable prices  and moderate long term interest rates in the Federal Reserve Act  7  The first two objectives are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserve s dual mandate  8  Its duties have expanded over the years and today  according to official Federal Reserve documentation  include conducting the nation s monetary policy  supervising and regulating banking institutions  maintaining the stability of the financial system and providing financial services to depository institutions  the U S  government  and foreign official institutions  9  The Fed also conducts research into the economy and releases numerous publications  such as the Beige Book  The Federal Reserve System s structure is composed of the presidentially appointed Board of Governors  or Federal Reserve Board   the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC   twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks located in major cities throughout the nation  numerous privately owned U S  member banks and various advisory councils  10  11  12  The FOMC is the committee responsible for setting monetary policy and consists of all seven members of the Board of Governors and the twelve regional bank presidents  though only five bank presidents vote at any given time  The Federal Reserve System has both private and public components  and was designed to serve the interests of both the general public and private bankers  The result is a structure that is considered unique among central banks  It is also unusual in that an entity outside of the central bank  namely the United States Department of the Treasury  creates the currency used  13  According to the Board of Governors  the Federal Reserve is independent within government in that  its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government   Its authority is derived from statutes enacted by the U S  Congress and the System is subject to congressional oversight  The members of the Board of Governors  including its chairman and vice chairman  are chosen by the President and confirmed by the Senate  The government also exercises some control over the Federal Reserve by appointing and setting the salaries of the system s highest level employees  Thus the Federal Reserve has both private and public aspects  14  15  16  17  The U S  Government receives all of the system s annual profits  after a statutory dividend of 6  on member banks  capital investment is paid  and an account surplus is maintained  In 2010  the Federal Reserve made a profit of  82 billion and transferred  79 billion to the U S  Treasury  18  This was followed at the end of 2011 with a transfer of  77 billion in profits to the U S  Treasury Department  19  Contents 1 History 1 1

Sites critical of the Federal Reserve  edit  History  edit  Central banking in the United States Main article  History of central banking in the United States In 1690  the Massachusetts Bay Colony became the first to issue paper money in what would become the United States  but soon others began printing their own money as well  The demand for currency in the colonies was due to the scarcity of coins  which had been the primary means of trade  20  Colonies  paper currencies were used to pay for their expenses  as well as a means to lend money to the colonies  citizens  Paper money quickly became the primary means of exchange within each colony  and it even began to be used in financial transactions with other colonies  21  However  some of the currencies were not redeemable in gold or silver  which caused them to depreciate  20  The Currency Act of 1751 set limits on the issuance of Bills of Credit by the New England states and set requirements for the redemption of any bills issued  This Act was in response to the overissuance of bills by Rhode Island  eventually reducing their value to 1 27 of the issuing value  22  The Currency Act of 1764 completely banned the issuance of Bills of Credit  paper money  in the colonies and the making of such bills legal tender because their depreciation allowed the discharge of debts with depreciated paper at a rate less then contracted for  to the great discouragement and prejudice of the trade and commerce of his Majesty s subjects  The ban proved extremely harmful to the economy of the colonies and inhibited trade  both within the colonies and abroad  23  The first attempt at a national currency was during the American Revolutionary War  In 1775 the Continental Congress  as well as the states  began issuing paper currency  calling the bills  Continentals   The Continentals were backed only by future tax revenue  and were used to help finance the Revolutionary War  Overprinting  as well as British counterfeiting caused the value of the Continental to diminish quickly  This experience with paper money led the United States to strip the power to issue Bills of Credit  paper money  from a draft of the new Constitution on August 16  1787  24  as well as banning such issuance by the various states  and limiting the states ability to make anything but gold or silver coin legal tender  25  In 1791 the government granted the First Bank of the United States a charter to operate as the U S  central bank until 1811  20  The First Bank of the United States came to an end under President Madison because Congress refused to renew its charter  The Second Bank of the United States was established in 1816  and lost its authority to be the central bank of the U S  twenty years later under President Jackson when its charter expired  Both banks were based upon the Bank of England  26  Ultimately  a third national bank  known as the Federal Reserve  was established in 1913 and still exists to this day   edit  Timeline of central banking in the United States 1791 1811  First Bank of the United States 1811 1816  No central bank 1816 1836  Second Bank of the United States 1837 1862

was the First Bank of the United States  chartered by Congress and signed into law by President George Washington on February 25  1791 at the urging of Alexander Hamilton  This was done despite strong opposition from Thomas Jefferson and James Madison  among numerous others  The charter was for twenty years and expired in 1811 under President Madison  because Congress refused to renew it  27  In 1816  however  Madison revived it in the form of the Second Bank of the United States  Years later  early renewal of the bank s charter became the primary issue in the reelection of President Andrew Jackson  After Jackson  who was opposed to the central bank  was reelected  he pulled the government s funds out of the bank  Nicholas Biddle  President of the Second Bank of the United States  responded by contracting the money supply to pressure Jackson to renew the bank s charter forcing the country into a recession  which the bank blamed on Jackson s policies citation needed   Interestingly  Jackson is the only President to completely pay off the national debt  The bank s charter was not renewed in 1836  From 1837 to 1862  in the Free Banking Era there was no formal central bank  From 1862 to 1913  a system of national banks was instituted by the 1863 National Banking Act  A series of bank panics  in 1873  1893  and 1907  provided strong demand for the creation of a centralized banking system   edit  Creation of Third Central Bank Main article  History of the Federal Reserve System The main motivation for the third central banking system came from the Panic of 1907  which caused renewed demands for banking and currency reform  28  During the last quarter of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century the United States economy went through a series of financial panics  29  According to many economists  the previous national banking system had two main weaknesses  an inelastic currency and a lack of liquidity  29  In 1908  Congress enacted the Aldrich Vreeland Act  which provided for an emergency currency and established the National Monetary Commission to study banking and currency reform  30  The National Monetary Commission returned with recommendations which were repeatedly rejected by Congress  A revision crafted during a secret meeting on Jekyll Island by Senator Aldrich and representatives of the nations top finance and industrial groups later became the basis of the Federal Reserve Act  31  32  The House voted on December 22  1913 with 298 yeas to 60 nays and 76 not voting and the Senate voting on December 23  1913 with 43 yeas to 25 nays and 27 not voting  33  President Woodrow Wilson signed the bill later that day at 6 02pm  34   edit  Federal Reserve Act Main article  Federal Reserve Act Newspaper clipping  December 24  1913 The head of the bipartisan National Monetary Commission was financial expert and Senate Republican leader Nelson Aldrich  Aldrich set up two commissions one to study the American monetary system in depth and the other  headed by Aldrich himself  to study the European central banking systems and report on them  30  Aldrich went to Europe opposed to centralized banking  but after viewing Germany s monetary system he came away believing that a centralized bank was better than the government issued bond system that he had previously supported  In early November 1910  Aldrich met with five well known members of the New York banking community to devise a central banking bill  Paul Warburg  an attendee of the meeting and long time advocate of central banking in the U S   later wrote that Aldrich was  bewildered at all that he had absorbed abroad and he was faced with the difficult task of writing a highly technical bill while being harassed by the daily grind of his parliamentary duties   35  After ten days of deliberation  the bill  which would later be referred to as the  Aldrich Plan   was agreed upon  It had several key components  including a central bank with a Washington based headquarters and fifteen branches located throughout the U S  in geographically strategic locations  and a uniform elastic currency based on gold and commercial paper  Aldrich believed a central banking system with no political involvement was best  but was convinced by Warburg that a plan with no public control was not politically feasible  35  The compromise involved representation of the public sector on the Board of Directors  36  Aldrich s bill met much opposition from politicians  Critics charged Aldrich of being biased due to his close ties to wealthy bankers such as J  P  Morgan and John D  Rockefeller  Jr   Aldrich s son in law  Most Republicans favored the Aldrich Plan  36  but it lacked enough support in Congress to pass because rural and western states viewed it as favoring the  eastern establishment   2  In contrast  progressive Democrats favored a reserve system owned and operated by the government  they believed that public ownership of the central bank would end Wall Street s control of the American currency supply  36  Conservative Democrats fought for a privately owned  yet decentralized  reserve system  which would still be free of Wall Street s control  36  The original Aldrich Plan was dealt a fatal blow in 1912  when Democrats won the White House and Congress  35  Nonetheless  President Woodrow Wilson believed that the Aldrich plan would suffice with a few modifications  The plan became the basis for the Federal Reserve Act  which was proposed by Senator Robert Owen in May 1913  The primary difference between the two bills was the transfer of control of the Board of Directors  called the Federal Open Market Committee in the Federal Reserve Act  to the government  2  27  The bill passed Congress on December 23  1913  37  38  on a mostly partisan basis  with most Democrats voting  yea  and most Republicans voting  nay   27   edit  Key laws Key laws affecting the Federal Reserve have

Emergency Economic Stabilization Act  2008  Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act  2010   edit  Purpose The primary motivation for creating the Federal Reserve System was to address banking panics  3  Other purposes are stated in the Federal Reserve Act  such as  to furnish an elastic currency  to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper  to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United States  and for other purposes   40  Before the founding of the Federal Reserve  the United States underwent several financial crises  A particularly severe crisis in 1907 led Congress to enact the Federal Reserve Act in 1913  Today the Federal Reserve System has broader responsibilities than only ensuring the stability of the financial system  41  Current functions of the Federal Reserve System include  9  41  To address the problem of banking panics To serve as the central bank for the United States To strike a balance between private interests of banks and the centralized responsibility of government To supervise and regulate banking institutions To protect the credit rights of consumers To manage the nation s money supply through monetary policy to achieve the sometimes conflicting goals of maximum employment stable prices  including prevention of either inflation or deflation 42  moderate long term interest rates To maintain the stability of the financial system and contain systemic risk in financial markets To provide financial services to depository institutions  the U S  government  and foreign official institutions  including playing a major role in operating the nation s payments system To facilitate the exchange of payments among regions To respond to local liquidity needs To strengthen U S  standing in the world economy  edit  Addressing the problem of bank panics Further information  bank run and fractional reserve banking Bank runs occur because banking institutions in the United States are only required to hold a fraction of their depositors  money in reserve  This practice is called fractional reserve banking  As a result  most banks invest the majority of their depositors  money  On rare occasion  too many of the bank s customers will withdraw their savings and the bank will need help from another institution to continue operating  Bank runs can lead to a multitude of social and economic problems  The Federal Reserve was designed as an attempt to prevent or minimize the occurrence of bank runs  and possibly act as a lender of last resort if a bank run does occur  Many economists  following Milton Friedman  believe that the Federal Reserve inappropriately refused to lend money to small banks during the bank runs of 1929  43   edit  Elastic currency The monthly changes in the currency component of the U S  money supply show currency being added into    change greater than zero  and removed from circulation    change less than zero   The most noticeable changes occur around the Christmas holiday shopping season as new currency is created so people can make withdrawals at banks  and then removed from circulation afterwards  when less cash is demanded  One way to prevent bank runs is to have a money supply that can expand when money is needed  The term  elastic currency  in the Federal Reserve Act does not just mean the ability to expand the money supply  but also to contract it  Some economic theories have been developed that support the idea of expanding or shrinking a money supply as economic conditions warrant  Elastic currency is defined by the Federal Reserve as  44  Currency that can  by the actions of the central monetary authority  expand or contract in amount warranted by economic conditions  Monetary policy of the Federal Reserve System is based partially on the theory that it is best overall to expand or contract the money supply as economic conditions change   edit  Check Clearing System Because some banks refused to clear checks from certain others during times of economic uncertainty  a check clearing system was created in the Federal Reserve system  It is briefly described in The Federal Reserve System Purposes and Functions as follows  45  By creating the Federal Reserve System  Congress intended to eliminate the severe financial crises that had periodically swept the nation  especially the sort of financial panic that occurred in 1907  During that episode  payments were disrupted throughout the country because many banks and clearinghouses refused to clear checks drawn on certain other banks  a practice that contributed to the failure of otherwise solvent banks  To address these problems  Congress gave the Federal Reserve System the authority to establish a nationwide check clearing system  The System  then  was to provide not only an elastic currency that is  a currency that would expand or shrink in amount as economic conditions warranted but also an efficient and equitable check collection system   edit  Lender of last resort In the United States  the Federal Reserve serves as the lender of last resort to those institutions that cannot obtain credit elsewhere and the collapse of which would have serious implications for the economy  It took over this role from the private sector  clearing houses  which operated during the Free Banking Era  whether public or private  the availability of liquidity was intended to prevent bank runs   edit  Emergencies According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis   the Federal Reserve has the authority and financial resources to act as  lender of last resort  by extending credit to depository institutions or to other entities in unusual circumstances involving a national or regional emergency  where failure to obtain credit would have a severe adverse impact on the economy   46  The Federal Reserve System s role as lender of last resort has been criticized because it shifts the risk and responsibility away from lenders and borrowers and places it on others in the form of inflation  47   edit  Fluctuations Through its discount and credit operations  Reserve Banks provide liquidity to banks to meet short term needs stemming from seasonal fluctuations in deposits or unexpected withdrawals  Longer term liquidity may also be provided in exceptional circumstances  The rate the Fed charges banks for these loans is the discount rate  officially the primary credit rate   By making these loans  the Fed serves as a buffer against unexpected day to day fluctuations in reserve demand and supply  This contributes to the effective functioning of the banking system  alleviates pressure in the reserves market and reduces the extent of unexpected movements in the interest rates  48  For example  on September 16  2008  the Federal Reserve Board authorized an  85 billion loan to stave off the bankruptcy of international insurance giant American International Group  AIG   49  50   edit  Central bank Further information  Central bank In its role as the central bank of the United States  the Fed serves as a banker s bank and as the government s bank  As the banker s bank  it helps to assure the safety and efficiency of the payments system  As the government s bank  or fiscal agent  the Fed processes a variety of financial transactions involving trillions of dollars  Just as an individual might keep an account at a bank  the U S  Treasury keeps a checking account with the Federal Reserve  through which incoming federal tax deposits and outgoing government payments are handled  As part of this service relationship  the Fed sells and redeems U S  government securities such as savings bonds and Treasury bills  notes and bonds  It also issues the nation s coin and paper currency  The U S  Treasury  through its Bureau of the Mint and Bureau of Engraving and Printing  actually produces the nation s cash supply and  in effect  sells the paper currency to the Federal Reserve Banks at manufacturing cost  and the coins at face value  The Federal Reserve Banks then distribute it to other financial institutions in various ways  51  During the Fiscal Year 2008  the Bureau of Engraving and Printing delivered 7 7 billion notes at an average cost of 6 4 cents per note  52   edit  Federal funds Main article  Federal funds Federal funds are the reserve balances  also called federal reserve accounts  that private banks keep at their local Federal Reserve Bank  53  54  These balances are the namesake reserves of the Federal Reserve System  The purpose of keeping funds at a Federal Reserve Bank is to have a mechanism for private banks to lend funds to one another  This market for funds plays an important role in the Federal Reserve System as it is what inspired the name of the system and it is what is used as the basis for monetary policy  Monetary policy works partly by influencing how much interest the private banks charge each other for the lending of these funds  Federal reserve accounts contain federal reserve credit  which can be converted into federal reserve notes  Private banks maintain their bank reserves in federal reserve accounts   edit  Balance between private banks and responsibility of governments The system was designed out of a compromise between the competing philosophies of privatization and government regulation  In 2006 Donald L  Kohn  vice chairman of the Board of Governors  summarized the history of this compromise  55  Agrarian and progressive interests  led by William Jennings Bryan  favored a central bank under public  rather than banker  control  But the vast majority of the nation s bankers  concerned about government intervention in the banking business  opposed a central bank structure directed by political appointees  The legislation that Congress ultimately adopted in 1913 reflected a hard fought battle to balance these two competing views and created the hybrid public private  centralized decentralized structure that we have today  In the current system  private banks are for profit businesses but government regulation places restrictions on what they can do  The Federal Reserve System is a part of government that regulates the private banks  The balance between privatization and government involvement is also seen in the structure of the system  Private banks elect members of the board of directors at their regional Federal Reserve Bank while the members of the Board of Governors are selected by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate  The private banks give input to the government officials about their economic situation and these government officials use this input in Federal Reserve policy decisions  In the end  private banking businesses are able to run a profitable business while the U S  government  through the Federal Reserve System  oversees and regulates the activities of the private banks   edit  Government regulation and supervision Ben Bernanke  lower right   Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors  at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on February 10  2009  Members of the Board frequently testify before congressional committees such as this one  The Senate equivalent of the House Financial Services Committee is the Senate Committee on Banking  Housing  and Urban Affairs  Federal Banking Agency Audit Act enacted in 1978 as Public Law 95 320 and Section 31 USC 714 of U S  Code establish that the Federal Reserve may be audited by the Government Accountability Office  GAO   56  The GAO has authority to audit check processing  currency storage and shipments  and some regulatory and bank examination functions  however there are restrictions to what the GAO may in fact audit  Audits of the Reserve Board and Federal Reserve banks may not include  transactions for or with a foreign central bank or government  or nonprivate international financing organization  deliberations  decisions  or actions on monetary policy matters  transactions made under the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee  or a part of a discussion or communication among or between members of the Board of Governors and officers and employees of the Federal Reserve System related to items  1    2   or  3   57  58  The financial crisis which began in 2007  corporate bailouts  and concerns over the Fed s secrecy have brought renewed concern regarding ability of the Fed to effectively manage the national monetary system  59  A July 2009 Gallup Poll found only 30  Americans thought the Fed was doing a good or excellent job  a rating even lower than that for the Internal Revenue Service  which drew praise from 40   60  The Federal Reserve Transparency Act was introduced by congressman Ron Paul in order to obtain a more detailed audit of the Fed  The Fed has since hired Linda Robertson who headed the Washington lobbying office of Enron Corp  and was adviser to all three of the Clinton administration s Treasury secretaries  61  62  63  64  The Board of Governors in the Federal Reserve System has a number of supervisory and regulatory responsibilities in the U S  banking system  but not complete responsibility  A general description of the types of regulation and supervision involved in the U S  banking system is given by the Federal Reserve  65  The Board also plays a major role in the supervision and regulation of the U S  banking system  It has supervisory responsibilities for state chartered banks 66  that are members of the Federal Reserve System  bank holding companies  companies that control banks   the foreign activities of member banks  the U S  activities of foreign banks  and Edge Act and  agreement corporations   limited purpose institutions that engage in a foreign banking business   The Board and  under delegated authority  the Federal Reserve Banks  supervise approximately 900 state member banks and 5 000 bank holding companies  Other federal agencies also serve as the primary federal supervisors of commercial banks  the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency supervises national banks  and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation supervises state banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System  Some regulations issued by the Board apply to the entire banking industry  whereas others apply only to member banks  that is  state banks that have chosen to join the Federal Reserve System and national banks  which by law must be members of the System  The Board also issues regulations to carry out major federal laws governing consumer credit protection  such as the Truth in Lending  Equal Credit Opportunity  and Home Mortgage Disclosure Acts  Many of these consumer protection regulations apply to various lenders outside the banking industry as well as to banks  Members of the Board of Governors are in continual contact with other policy makers in government  They frequently testify before congressional committees on the economy  monetary policy  banking supervision and regulation  consumer credit protection  financial markets  and other matters  The Board has regular contact with members of the President s Council of Economic Advisers and other key economic officials  The Chairman also meets from time to time with the President of the United States and has regular meetings with the Secretary of the Treasury  The Chairman has formal responsibilities in the international arena as well   edit  Preventing asset bubbles The board of directors of each Federal Reserve Bank District also has regulatory and supervisory responsibilities  For example  a member bank  private bank  is not permitted to give out too many loans to people who cannot pay them back  This is because too many defaults on loans will lead to a bank run  If the board of directors has judged that a member bank is performing or behaving poorly  it will report this to the Board of Governors  This policy is described in United States Code  67  Each Federal reserve bank shall keep itself informed of the general character and amount of the loans and investments of its member banks with a view to ascertaining whether undue use is being made of bank credit for the speculative carrying of or trading in securities  real estate  or commodities  or for any other purpose inconsistent with the maintenance of sound credit conditions  and  in determining whether to grant or refuse advances  rediscounts  or other credit accommodations  the Federal reserve bank shall give consideration to such information  The chairman of the Federal reserve bank shall report to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System any such undue use of bank credit by any member bank  together with his recommendation  Whenever  in the judgment of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  any member bank is making such undue use of bank credit  the Board may  in its discretion  after reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing  suspend such bank from the use of the credit facilities of the Federal Reserve System and may terminate such suspension or may renew it from time to time  The punishment for making false statements or reports that overvalue an asset is also stated in the U S  Code  68  Whoever knowingly makes any false statement or report  or willfully overvalues any land  property or security  for the purpose of influencing in any way   shall be fined not more than  1 000 000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years  or both  These aspects of the Federal Reserve System are the parts intended to prevent or minimize speculative asset bubbles  which ultimately lead to severe market corrections  The recent bubbles and corrections in energies  grains  equity and debt products and real estate cast doubt on the efficacy of these controls   edit  National payments system The Federal Reserve plays an important role in the U S  payments system  The twelve Federal Reserve Banks provide banking services to depository institutions and to the federal government  For depository institutions  they maintain accounts and provide various payment services  including collecting checks  electronically transferring funds  and distributing and receiving currency and coin  For the federal government  the Reserve Banks act as fiscal agents  paying Treasury checks  processing electronic payments  and issuing  transferring  and redeeming U S  government securities  69  In passing the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980  Congress reaffirmed its intention that the Federal Reserve should promote an efficient nationwide payments system  The act subjects all depository institutions  not just member commercial banks  to reserve requirements and grants them equal access to Reserve Bank payment services  It also encourages competition between the Reserve Banks and private sector providers of payment services by requiring the Reserve Banks to charge fees for certain payments services listed in the act and to recover the costs of providing these services over the long run  The Federal Reserve plays a vital role in both the nation s retail and wholesale payments systems  providing a variety of financial services to depository institutions  Retail payments are generally for relatively small dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution s retail clients individuals and smaller businesses  The Reserve Banks  retail services include distributing currency and coin  collecting checks  and electronically transferring funds through the automated clearinghouse system  By contrast  wholesale payments are generally for large dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution s large corporate customers or counterparties  including other financial institutions  The Reserve Banks  wholesale services include electronically transferring funds through the Fedwire Funds Service and transferring securities issued by the U S  government  its agencies  and certain other entities through the Fedwire Securities Service  Because of the large amounts of funds that move through the Reserve Banks every day  the System has policies and procedures to limit the risk to the Reserve Banks from a depository institution s failure to make or settle its payments  The Federal Reserve Banks began a multi year restructuring of their check operations in 2003 as part of a long term strategy to respond to the declining use of checks by consumers and businesses and the greater use of electronics in check processing  The Reserve Banks will have reduced the number of full service check processing locations from 45 in 2003 to 4 by early 2011  70   edit  Structure Main article  Structure of the Federal Reserve System Organization of the Federal Reserve System The Federal Reserve System has both private and public components  and can make decisions without the permission of Congress or the President of the U S  14  The System does not require public funding  and derives its authority and purpose from the Federal Reserve Act passed by Congress in 1913  The four main components of the Federal Reserve System are  1  the Board of Governors   2  the Federal Open Market Committee   3  the twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks  and  4  the member banks throughout the country   edit  Board of Governors Main article  Federal Reserve Board of Governors The seven member Board of Governors is a federal agency  It is charged with the overseeing of the 12 District Reserve Banks and setting national monetary policy  It also supervises and regulates the U S  banking system in general  71  Governors are appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate for staggered 14 year terms  48  One term begins every two years  on February 1 of even numbered years  and members serving a full term cannot be renominated for a second term  72  The Board is required to make an annual report of operations to the Speaker of the U S  House of Representatives  The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors are appointed by the President from among the sitting Governors  They both serve a four year term and they can be renominated as many times as the President chooses  until their terms on the Board of Governors expire  73   edit  List of members of the Board of Governors The current members of the Board of Governors are as follows  72  Commissioner Entered office 74  Term expires Ben Bernanke  Chairman  February 1  2006 January 31  2020 January 31  2014  as Chairman

Vacant    January 31  2014 Vacant    January 31  2018 Vacant    January 31  2026  edit  Nominations In late December  2011  President Barack Obama nominated two individuals to fill the vacant seats on the board  Jeremy Stein  a Harvard University finance professor and a Democrat  and Jerome Powell  formerly of Dillon Read  Bankers Trust 75  and The Carlyle Group 76  and a Republican  Both candidates also have Treasury Department experience in the Obama and George H W  Bush administrations respectively  75   Obama administration officials regrouped to identify Fed candidates after Peter Diamond  a Nobel Prize winning economist  withdrew his nomination to the board in June  2011  in the face of Republican opposition  Richard Clarida  a potential nominee who was a Treasury official under George W  Bush  pulled out of consideration in August  2011    one account of the December nominations noted  77  The two other Obama nominees in 2011  Yellen and Raskin  78  were confirmed in September  79  One of the vacancies was created in 2011 with the resignation of Kevin Warsh  who took office in 2006 to fill the unexpired term ending January 31  2018 and resigned his position effective March 31  2011  80  81   edit  Federal Open Market Committee Main article  Federal Open Market Committee The Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  consists of 12 members  seven from the Board of Governors and 5 of the regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents  The FOMC oversees open market operations  the principal tool of national monetary policy  These operations affect the amount of Federal Reserve balances available to depository institutions  thereby influencing overall monetary and credit conditions  The FOMC also directs operations undertaken by the Federal Reserve in foreign exchange markets  The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is a permanent member of the FOMC  while the rest of the bank presidents rotate at two  and three year intervals  All Regional Reserve Bank presidents contribute to the committee s assessment of the economy and of policy options  but only the five presidents who are then members of the FOMC vote on policy decisions  The FOMC determines its own internal organization and  by tradition  elects the Chairman of the Board of Governors as its chairman and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as its vice chairman  It is informal policy within the FOMC for the Board of Governors and the New York Federal Reserve Bank president to vote with the Chairman of the FOMC  anyone who is not an expert on monetary policy traditionally votes with the chairman as well  and in any vote no more than two FOMC members can dissent  82  Formal meetings typically are held eight times each year in Washington  D C  Nonvoting Reserve Bank presidents also participate in Committee deliberations and discussion  The FOMC generally meets eight times a year in telephone consultations and other meetings are held when needed  83   edit  Federal Reserve Banks Main article  Federal Reserve Bank Federal Reserve Districts There are 12 Federal Reserve Banks located in Boston  New York  Philadelphia  Cleveland  Richmond  Atlanta  Chicago  St Louis  Minneapolis  Kansas City  Dallas  and San Francisco  Each reserve Bank is responsible for member banks located in its district  The size of each district was set based upon the population distribution of the United States when the Federal Reserve Act was passed  Each regional Bank has a president  who is the chief executive officer of their Bank  Each regional Reserve Bank s president is nominated by their Bank s board of directors  but the nomination is contingent upon approval by the Board of Governors  Presidents serve five year terms and may be reappointed  84  Each regional Bank s board consists of nine members  Members are broken down into three classes  A  B  and C  There are three board members in each class  Class A members are chosen by the regional Bank s shareholders  and are intended to represent member banks  interests  Member banks are divided into three categories large  medium  and small  Each category elects one of the three class A board members  Class B board members are also nominated by the region s member banks  but class B board members are supposed to represent the interests of the public  Lastly  class C board members are nominated by the Board of Governors  and are also intended to represent the interests of the public  85  A member bank is a private institution and owns stock in its regional Federal Reserve Bank  All nationally chartered banks hold stock in one of the Federal Reserve Banks  State chartered banks may choose to be members  and hold stock in their regional Federal Reserve bank   upon meeting certain standards  About 38  of U S  banks are members of their regional Federal Reserve Bank  86  The amount of stock a member bank must own is equal to 3  of its combined capital and surplus  87  88  However  holding stock in a Federal Reserve bank is not like owning stock in a publicly traded company  These stocks cannot be sold or traded  and member banks do not control the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of owning this stock  The charter and organization of each Federal Reserve Bank is established by law and cannot be altered by the member banks  Member banks  do however  elect six of the nine members of the Federal Reserve Banks  boards of directors  48  89  From the profits of the Regional Bank of which it is a member  a member bank receives a dividend equal to 6  of their purchased stock  14  The remainder of the regional Federal Reserve Banks  profits is given over to the United States Treasury Department  In 2009  the Federal Reserve Banks distributed  1 4 billion in dividends to member banks and returned  47 billion to the U S  Treasury  90   edit  Legal status of regional Federal Reserve Banks The Federal Reserve Banks have an intermediate legal status  with some features of private corporations and some features of public federal agencies  The United States has an interest in the Federal Reserve Banks as tax exempt federally created instrumentalities whose profits belong to the federal government  but this interest is not proprietary  91  In Lewis v  United States  92  the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated that   The Reserve Banks are not federal instrumentalities for purposes of the FTCA  the Federal Tort Claims Act   but are independent  privately owned and locally controlled corporations   The opinion went on to say  however  that   The Reserve Banks have properly been held to be federal instrumentalities for some purposes   Another relevant decision is Scott v  Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  91  in which the distinction is made between Federal Reserve Banks  which are federally created instrumentalities  and the Board of Governors  which is a federal agency  Regarding the structural relationship between the twelve Federal Reserve banks and the various commercial  member  banks            the  ownership  of the Reserve Banks by the commercial banks is symbolic  they do not exercise the proprietary control associated with the concept of ownership nor share  beyond the statutory dividend  in Reserve Bank  profits            Bank ownership and election at the base are therefore devoid of substantive significance  despite the superficial appearance of private bank control that the formal arrangement creates  93   edit  Member banks According to the web site for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond    m ore than one third of U S  commercial banks are members of the Federal Reserve System  National banks must be members  state chartered banks may join by meeting certain requirements   94   edit  Accountability The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  the Federal Reserve banks  and the individual member banks undergo regular audits by the GAO and an outside auditor  GAO audits are limited and do not cover  most of the Fed s monetary policy actions or decisions  including discount window lending  direct loans to financial institutions   open market operations and any other transactions made under the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee      nor may the GAO audit   dealings with foreign governments and other central banks    95  Various statutory changes  including the Federal Reserve Transparency Act  have been proposed to broaden the scope of the audits  November 7  2008  Bloomberg L P  News brought a lawsuit  Bloomberg L P  v  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  against the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to force the Board to reveal the identities of firms for which it has provided guarantees during the Late 2000s financial crisis  96  Bloomberg  L P  won at the trial court 97  and the Fed s appeals were rejected at both the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the U S  Supreme Court  The data 98  was released March 31  2011  99   edit  Monetary policy Further information  Monetary policy of the United States The term  monetary policy  refers to the actions undertaken by a central bank  such as the Federal Reserve  to influence the availability and cost of money and credit to help promote national economic goals  What happens to money and credit affects interest rates  the cost of credit  and the performance of an economy  The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 gave the Federal Reserve authority to set monetary policy in the United States  100  101   edit  Interbank lending is the basis of policy The Federal Reserve sets monetary policy by influencing the Federal funds rate  which is the rate of interbank lending of excess reserves  The rate that banks charge each other for these loans is determined in the interbank market but the Federal Reserve influences this rate through the three  tools  of monetary policy described in the Tools section below  The Federal Funds rate is a short term interest rate the FOMC focuses on directly  This rate ultimately affects the longer term interest rates throughout the economy  A summary of the basis and implementation of monetary policy is stated by the Federal Reserve  The Federal Reserve implements U S  monetary policy by affecting conditions in the market for balances that depository institutions hold at the Federal Reserve Banks   By conducting open market operations  imposing reserve requirements  permitting depository institutions to hold contractual clearing balances  and extending credit through its discount window facility  the Federal Reserve exercises considerable control over the demand for and supply of Federal Reserve balances and the federal funds rate  Through its control of the federal funds rate  the Federal Reserve is able to foster financial and monetary conditions consistent with its monetary policy objectives  102  This influences the economy through its effect on the quantity of reserves that banks use to make loans  Policy actions that add reserves to the banking system encourage lending at lower interest rates thus stimulating growth in money  credit  and the economy  Policy actions that absorb reserves work in the opposite direction  The Fed s task is to supply enough reserves to support an adequate amount of money and credit  avoiding the excesses that result in inflation and the shortages that stifle economic growth  103   edit  Tools There are three main tools of monetary policy that the Federal Reserve uses to influence the amount of reserves in private banks  100  Tool Description Open market operations Purchases and sales of U S  Treasury and federal agency securities the Federal Reserve s principal tool for implementing monetary policy  The Federal Reserve s objective for open market operations has varied over the years  During the 1980s  the focus gradually shifted toward attaining a specified level of the federal funds rate  the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans of federal funds  which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed   a process that was largely complete by the end of the decade  104  Discount rate The interest rate charged to commercial banks and other depository institutions on loans they receive from their regional Federal Reserve Bank s lending facility the discount window  105  Reserve requirements The amount of funds that a depository institution must hold in reserve against specified deposit liabilities  106   edit  Federal funds rate and open market operations Further information  open market operations  money creation  and federal funds rate The effective federal funds rate charted over more than fifty years  The Federal Reserve System implements monetary policy largely by targeting the federal funds rate  This is the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans of federal funds  which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed  This rate is actually determined by the market and is not explicitly mandated by the Fed  The Fed therefore tries to align the effective federal funds rate with the targeted rate by adding or subtracting from the money supply through open market operations  The Federal Reserve System usually adjusts the federal funds rate target by 0 25  or 0 50  at a time  Open market operations allow the Federal Reserve to increase or decrease the amount of money in the banking system as necessary to balance the Federal Reserve s dual mandates  Open market operations are done through the sale and purchase of United States Treasury security  sometimes called  Treasury bills  or more informally  T bills  or  Treasuries   The Federal Reserve buys Treasury bills from its primary dealers  The purchase of these securities affects the federal funds rate  because primary dealers have accounts at depository institutions  107  The Federal Reserve education website describes open market operations as follows  101  Open market operations involve the buying and selling of U S  government securities  federal agency and mortgage backed   The term  open market  means that the Fed doesn t decide on its own which securities dealers it will do business with on a particular day  Rather  the choice emerges from an  open market  in which the various securities dealers that the Fed does business with the primary dealers compete on the basis of price  Open market operations are flexible and thus  the most frequently used tool of monetary policy  Open market operations are the primary tool used to regulate the supply of bank reserves  This tool consists of Federal Reserve purchases and sales of financial instruments  usually securities issued by the U S  Treasury  Federal agencies and government sponsored enterprises  Open market operations are carried out by the Domestic Trading Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under direction from the FOMC  The transactions are undertaken with primary dealers  The Fed s goal in trading the securities is to affect the federal funds rate  the rate at which banks borrow reserves from each other  When the Fed wants to increase reserves  it buys securities and pays for them by making a deposit to the account maintained at the Fed by the primary dealer s bank  When the Fed wants to reduce reserves  it sells securities and collects from those accounts  Most days  the Fed does not want to increase or decrease reserves permanently so it usually engages in transactions reversed within a day or two  That means that a reserve injection today could be withdrawn tomorrow morning  only to be renewed at some level several hours later  These short term transactions are called repurchase agreements  repos    the dealer sells the Fed a security and agrees to buy it back at a later date   edit  Repurchase agreements Further information  repurchase agreement To smooth temporary or cyclical changes in the money supply  the desk engages in repurchase agreements  repos  with its primary dealers  Repos are essentially secured  short term lending by the Fed  On the day of the transaction  the Fed deposits money in a primary dealer s reserve account  and receives the promised securities as collateral  When the transaction matures  the process unwinds  the Fed returns the collateral and charges the primary dealer s reserve account for the principal and accrued interest  The term of the repo  the time between settlement and maturity  can vary from 1 day  called an overnight repo  to 65 days  108   edit  Discount rate Further information  discount window The Federal Reserve System also directly sets the  discount rate   which is the interest rate for  discount window lending   overnight loans that member banks borrow directly from the Fed  This rate is generally set at a rate close to 100 basis points above the target federal funds rate  The idea is to encourage banks to seek alternative funding before using the  discount rate  option  109  The equivalent operation by the European Central Bank is referred to as the  marginal lending facility   110  Both the discount rate and the federal funds rate influence the prime rate  which is usually about 3 percent higher than the federal funds rate   edit  Reserve requirements Another instrument of monetary policy adjustment employed by the Federal Reserve System is the fractional reserve requirement  also known as the required reserve ratio  111  The required reserve ratio sets the balance that the Federal Reserve System requires a depository institution to hold in the Federal Reserve Banks  102  which depository institutions trade in the federal funds market discussed above  112  The required reserve ratio is set by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  113  The reserve requirements have changed over time and some of the history of these changes is published by the Federal Reserve  114  Reserve Requirements in the U S  Federal Reserve System 106  Liability Type Requirement Percentage of liabilities Effective date Net transaction accounts  0 to  10 7 million 0 12 30 10 More than  10 7 million to  58 8 million 3 12 30 10 More than  58 8 million 10 12 30 10 Nonpersonal time deposits 0 12 27 90 Eurocurrency liabilities 0 12 27 90 As a response to the financial crisis of 2008  the Federal Reserve now makes interest payments on depository institutions  required and excess reserve balances  The payment of interest on excess reserves gives the central bank greater opportunity to address credit market conditions while maintaining the federal funds rate close to the target rate set by the FOMC  115   edit  New facilities In order to address problems related to the subprime mortgage crisis and United States housing bubble  several new tools have been created  The first new tool  called the Term Auction Facility  was added on December 12  2007  It was first announced as a temporary tool 116  but there have been suggestions that this new tool may remain in place for a prolonged period of time  117  Creation of the second new tool  called the Term Securities Lending Facility  was announced on March 11  2008  118  The main difference between these two facilities is that the Term Auction Facility is used to inject cash into the banking system whereas the Term Securities Lending Facility is used to inject treasury securities into the banking system  119  Creation of the third tool  called the Primary Dealer Credit Facility  PDCF   was announced on March 16  2008  120  The PDCF was a fundamental change in Federal Reserve policy because now the Fed is able to lend directly to primary dealers  which was previously against Fed policy  121  The differences between these 3 new facilities is described by the Federal Reserve  122  The Term Auction Facility program offers term funding to depository institutions via a bi weekly auction  for fixed amounts of credit  The Term Securities Lending Facility will be an auction for a fixed amount of lending of Treasury general collateral in exchange for OMO eligible and AAA Aaa rated private label residential mortgage backed securities  The Primary Dealer Credit Facility now allows eligible primary dealers to borrow at the existing Discount Rate for up to 120 days  Some of the measures taken by the Federal Reserve to address this mortgage crisis have not been used since The Great Depression  123  The Federal Reserve gives a brief summary of these new facilities  124  As the economy has slowed in the last nine months and credit markets have become unstable  the Federal Reserve has taken a number of steps to help address the situation  These steps have included the use of traditional monetary policy tools at the macroeconomic level as well as measures at the level of specific markets to provide additional liquidity  The Federal Reserve s response has continued to evolve since pressure on credit markets began to surface last summer  but all these measures derive from the Fed s traditional open market operations and discount window tools by extending the term of transactions  the type of collateral  or eligible borrowers  A fourth facility  the Term Deposit Facility  was announced December 9  2009  and approved April 30  2010  with an effective date of Jun 4  2010  125  The Term Deposit Facility allows Reserve Banks to offer term deposits to institutions that are eligible to receive earnings on their balances at Reserve Banks  Term deposits are intended to facilitate the implementation of monetary policy by providing a tool by which the Federal Reserve can manage the aggregate quantity of reserve balances held by depository institutions  Funds placed in term deposits are removed from the accounts of participating institutions for the life of the term deposit and thus drain reserve balances from the banking system   edit  Term auction facility Further information  Term auction facility The Term Auction Facility is a program in which the Federal Reserve auctions term funds to depository institutions  116  The creation of this facility was announced by the Federal Reserve on December 12  2007 and was done in conjunction with the Bank of Canada  the Bank of England  the European Central Bank  and the Swiss National Bank to address elevated pressures in short term funding markets  126  The reason it was created is because banks were not lending funds to one another and banks in need of funds were refusing to go to the discount window  Banks were not lending money to each other because there was a fear that the loans would not be paid back  Banks refused to go to the discount window because it is usually associated with the stigma of bank failure  127  128  129  130  Under the Term Auction Facility  the identity of the banks in need of funds is protected in order to avoid the stigma of bank failure  131 Foreign exchange swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank were opened so the banks in Europe could have access to U S  dollars  131  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke briefly described this facility to the U S  House of Representatives on January 17  2008  the Federal Reserve recently unveiled a term auction facility  or TAF  through which prespecified amounts of discount window credit can be auctioned to eligible borrowers  The goal of the TAF is to reduce the incentive for banks to hoard cash and increase their willingness to provide credit to households and firms   TAF auctions will continue as long as necessary to address elevated pressures in short term funding markets  and we will continue to work closely and cooperatively with other central banks to address market strains that could hamper the achievement of our broader economic objectives  132  It is also described in the Term Auction Facility FAQ 116  The TAF is a credit facility that allows a depository institution to place a bid for an advance from its local Federal Reserve Bank at an interest rate that is determined as the result of an auction  By allowing the Federal Reserve to inject term funds through a broader range of counterparties and against a broader range of collateral than open market operations  this facility could help ensure that liquidity provisions can be disseminated efficiently even when the unsecured interbank markets are under stress  In short  the TAF will auction term funds of approximately one month maturity  All depository institutions that are judged to be in sound financial condition by their local Reserve Bank and that are eligible to borrow at the discount window are also eligible to participate in TAF auctions  All TAF credit must be fully collateralized  Depositories may pledge the broad range of collateral that is accepted for other Federal Reserve lending programs to secure TAF credit  The same collateral values and margins applicable for other Federal Reserve lending programs will also apply for the TAF   edit  Term securities lending facility The Term Securities Lending Facility is a 28 day facility that will offer Treasury general collateral to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York s primary dealers in exchange for other program eligible collateral  It is intended to promote liquidity in the financing markets for Treasury and other collateral and thus to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally  133  Like the Term Auction Facility  the TSLF was done in conjunction with the Bank of Canada  the Bank of England  the European Central Bank  and the Swiss National Bank  The resource allows dealers to switch debt that is less liquid for U S  government securities that are easily tradable  It is anticipated by Federal Reserve officials that the primary dealers  which include Goldman Sachs Group  Inc   J P  Morgan Chase  and Morgan Stanley  will lend the Treasuries on to other firms in return for cash  That will help the dealers finance their balance sheets  citation needed  The currency swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank were increased   edit  Primary dealer credit facility The Primary Dealer Credit Facility  PDCF  is an overnight loan facility that will provide funding to primary dealers in exchange for a specified range of eligible collateral and is intended to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally  122  This new facility marks a fundamental change in Federal Reserve policy because now primary dealers can borrow directly from the Fed when this previously was not permitted   edit  Interest on reserves As of October 2008 update   the Federal Reserve banks will pay interest on reserve balances  required  amp  excess  held by depository institutions  The rate is set at the lowest federal funds rate during the reserve maintenance period of an institution  less 75bp  134  As of October 23  2008  the Fed has lowered the spread to a mere 35 bp  135   edit  Term deposit facility The Term Deposit Facility is a program through which the Federal Reserve Banks will offer interest bearing term deposits to eligible institutions  By removing  excess deposits  from participating banks  the overall level of reserves available for lending is reduced  which should result in increased market interest rates  acting as a brake on economic activity and inflation  The Federal Reserve has stated that  Term deposits will be one of several tools that the Federal Reserve could employ to drain reserves when policymakers judge that it is appropriate to begin moving to a less accommodative stance of monetary policy  The development of the TDF is a matter of prudent planning and has no implication for the near term conduct of monetary policy  136  The Federal Reserve initially authorized up to five  small value offerings are designed to ensure the effectiveness of TDF operations and to provide eligible institutions with an opportunity to gain familiarity with term deposit procedures   137  After three of the offering auctions were successfully completed  it was announced that small value auctions would continue on an on going basis  138  The Term Deposit Facility is essentially a tool available to reverse the efforts that have been employed to provide liquidity to the financial markets and to reduce the amount of capital available to the economy  As stated in Bloomberg News  Policy makers led by Chairman Ben S  Bernanke are preparing for the day when they will have to start siphoning off more than  1 trillion in excess reserves from the banking system to contain inflation  The Fed is charting an eventual return to normal monetary policy  even as a weakening near term outlook has raised the possibility it may expand its balance sheet  139  Chairman Ben S  Bernanke  testifying before House Committee on Financial Services  described the Term Deposit Facility and other facilities to Congress in the following terms  Most importantly  in October 2008 the Congress gave the Federal Reserve statutory authority to pay interest on balances that banks hold at the Federal Reserve Banks  By increasing the interest rate on banks  reserves  the Federal Reserve will be able to put significant upward pressure on all short term interest rates  as banks will not supply short term funds to the money markets at rates significantly below what they can earn by holding reserves at the Federal Reserve Banks  Actual and prospective increases in short term interest rates will be reflected in turn in higher longer term interest rates and in tighter financial conditions more generally     As an additional means of draining reserves  the Federal Reserve is also developing plans to offer to depository institutions term deposits  which are roughly analogous to certificates of deposit that the institutions offer to their customers  A proposal describing a term deposit facility was recently published in the Federal Register  and the Federal Reserve is finalizing a revised proposal in light of the public comments that have been received  After a revised proposal is reviewed by the Board  we expect to be able to conduct test transactions this spring and to have the facility available if necessary thereafter  The use of reverse repos and the deposit facility would together allow the Federal Reserve to drain hundreds of billions of dollars of reserves from the banking system quite quickly  should it choose to do so  When these tools are used to drain reserves from the banking system  they do so by replacing bank reserves with other liabilities  the asset side and the overall size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet remain unchanged  If necessary  as a means of applying monetary restraint  the Federal Reserve also has the option of redeeming or selling securities  The redemption or sale of securities would have the effect of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet as well as further reducing the quantity of reserves in the banking system  Restoring the size and composition of the balance sheet to a more normal configuration is a longer term objective of our policies  In any case  the sequencing of steps and the combination of tools that the Federal Reserve uses as it exits from its currently very accommodative policy stance will depend on economic and financial developments and on our best judgments about how to meet the Federal Reserve s dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability  In sum  in response to severe threats to our economy  the Federal Reserve created a series of special lending facilities to stabilize the financial system and encourage the resumption of private credit flows to American families and businesses  As market conditions and the economic outlook have improved  these programs have been terminated or are being phased out  The Federal Reserve also promoted economic recovery through sharp reductions in its target for the federal funds rate and through large scale purchases of securities  The economy continues to require the support of accommodative monetary policies  However  we have been working to ensure that we have the tools to reverse  at the appropriate time  the currently very high degree of monetary stimulus  We have full confidence that  when the time comes  we will be ready to do so  140   edit  Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility The Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility  ABCPMMMFLF  was also called the AMLF  The Facility began operations on September 22  2008  and was closed on February 1  2010  141  All U S  depository institutions  bank holding companies  parent companies or U S  broker dealer affiliates   or U S  branches and agencies of foreign banks were eligible to borrow under this facility pursuant to the discretion of the FRBB  Collateral eligible for pledge under the Facility was required to meet the following criteria  was purchased by Borrower on or after September 19  2008 from a registered investment company that held itself out as a money market mutual fund  was purchased by Borrower at the Fund s acquisition cost as adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount on the ABCP through the date of its purchase by Borrower  was rated at the time pledged to FRBB  not lower than A1  F1  or P1 by at least two major rating agencies or  if rated by only one major rating agency  the ABCP must have been rated within the top rating category by that agency  was issued by an entity organized under the laws of the United States or a political subdivision thereof under a program that was in existence on September 18  2008  and had a stated maturity that did not exceed 120 days if the Borrower was a bank or 270 days for non bank Borrowers   edit  Commercial Paper Funding Facility The Commercial Paper Funding Facility  CPFF   on October 7  2008 the Federal Reserve further expanded the collateral it will loan against  to include commercial paper  The action made the Fed a crucial source of credit for non financial businesses in addition to commercial banks and investment firms  Fed officials said they ll buy as much of the debt as necessary to get the market functioning again  They refused to say how much that might be  but they noted that around  1 3 trillion worth of commercial paper would qualify  There was  1 61 trillion in outstanding commercial paper  seasonally adjusted  on the market as of October 1  2008  according to the most recent data from the Fed  That was down from  1 70 trillion in the previous week  Since the summer of 2007  the market has shrunk from more than  2 2 trillion  142  This program lent out a total  738 billion before it was closed  Forty five out of 81 of the companies participating in this program were foreign firms  Research shows that Troubled Asset Relief Program  TARP  recipients were twice as likely to participate in the program than other commercial paper issuers who did not take advantage of the TARP bailout  The Fed incurred no losses from the CPFF  143   edit  Quantitative policy A little used tool of the Federal Reserve is the quantitative policy  With that the Federal Reserve actually buys back corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities held by banks or other financial institutions  This in effect puts money back into the financial institutions and allows them to make loans and conduct normal business  The Federal Reserve Board used this policy in the early 1990s when the U S  economy experienced the savings and loan crisis  citation needed  The bursting of the United States housing bubble prompted the Fed to buy mortgage backed securities for the first time in November 2008  Over six weeks  a total of  1 25 trillion were purchased in order stabilize the housing market  about one fifth of all U S  government backed mortgages  144   edit  Measurement of economic variables The Federal Reserve records and publishes large

Personal consumption expenditures price index The Personal consumption expenditures price index  also referred to as simply the PCE price index  is used as one measure of the value of money  It is a United States wide indicator of the average increase in prices for all domestic personal consumption  Using a variety of data including U S  Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index prices  it is derived from the largest component of the Gross Domestic Product in the BEA s National Income and Product Accounts  personal consumption expenditures  One of the Fed s main roles is to maintain price stability  which means that the Fed s ability to keep a low inflation rate is a long term measure of the their success  152  Although the Fed is not required to maintain inflation within a specific range  their long run target for the growth of the PCE price index is between 1 5 and 2 percent  153  There has been debate among policy makers as to whether or not the Federal Reserve should have a specific inflation targeting policy  154  155  156   edit  Inflation and the economy   Whether to make the  reason  mandatory for the   cleanup   template is being discussed  See the request for

a sustained increase in the general level of prices  which is equivalent to a decline in the value or purchasing power of money  If the supply of money and credit increases too rapidly over many months  monetary inflation   the result will usually be price inflation  Price inflation does not always increase in direct proportion to monetary inflation  it is also affected by the velocity of money and other factors  With price inflation  a dollar buys less and less over time  101  The effects of monetary and price inflation include  101  Price inflation makes workers worse off if their incomes don t rise as rapidly as prices  Pensioners living on a fixed income are worse off if their savings do not increase more rapidly than prices  Lenders lose because they will be repaid with dollars that aren t worth as much  Savers lose because the dollar they save today will not buy as much when they are ready to spend it  Debtors win because the dollar they borrow today will be repaid with dollars that aren t worth as much  Businesses and people will find it harder to plan and therefore may decrease investment in future projects  Owners of financial assets suffer  Interest rate sensitive industries  like mortgage companies  suffer as monetary inflation drives up long term interest rates and Federal Reserve tightening raises short term rates  Developed market currencies become weaker against emerging markets  157  In his 1995 book The Case Against the Fed  economist Murray N  Rothbard argues that price inflation is caused only by an increase in the money supply  and only banks increase the money supply  then banks  including the Federal Reserve  are the only source of inflation  Adherents of the Austrian School of economic theory blame the economic crisis in the late 2000s 158  not in citation given  on the Federal Reserve s policy  particularly under the leadership of Alan Greenspan  of credit expansion through historically low interest rates starting in 2001  which they claim enabled the United States housing bubble  Most mainstream economists favor a low  steady rate of inflation  159  Low  as opposed to zero or negative  inflation may reduce the severity of economic recessions by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn  and reduce the risk that a liquidity trap prevents monetary policy from stabilizing the economy  160  The task of keeping the rate of inflation low and stable is usually given to monetary authorities   edit  Unemployment rate United States unemployment rates 1975 2010 showing variance between the fifty states Further information  Unemployment rate United States Bureau of Labor Statistics and List of U S  states by unemployment rate One of the stated goals of monetary policy is maximum employment  The unemployment rate statistics are collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics  and like the PCE price index are used as a barometer of the nation s economic health  and thus as a measure of the success of an administration s economic policies  Since 1980  both parties have made progressive changes in the basis for calculating unemployment  so that the numbers now quoted cannot be compared directly to the corresponding rates from earlier administrations  or to the rest of the world  161   edit  Budget Further information  seignorage The Federal Reserve is self funded  The vast majority  90    of Fed revenues come from open market operations  specifically the interest on the portfolio of Treasury securities as well as  capital gains losses  that may arise from the buying selling of the securities and their derivatives as part of Open Market Operations  The balance of revenues come from sales of financial services  check and electronic payment processing  and discount window loans  162  The Board of Governors  Federal Reserve Board  creates a budget report once per year for Congress  There are two reports with budget information  The one that lists the complete balance statements with income and expenses as well as the net profit or loss is the large report simply titled   Annual Report   It also includes data about employment throughout the system  The other report  which explains in more detail the expenses of the different aspects of the whole system  is called  Annual Report  Budget Review   These are comprehensive reports with many details and can be found at the Board of Governors  website under the section  Reports to Congress  163   edit  Net worth  edit  Balance sheet One of the keys to understanding the Federal Reserve is the Federal Reserve balance sheet  or balance statement   In accordance with Section 11 of the Federal Reserve Act  the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System publishes once each week the  Consolidated Statement of Condition of All Federal Reserve Banks  showing the condition of each Federal Reserve bank and a consolidated statement for all Federal Reserve banks  The Board of Governors requires that excess earnings of the Reserve Banks be transferred to the Treasury as interest on Federal Reserve notes  164  165  Below is the balance sheet as of July 6  2011  in billions of dollars

Analyzing the Federal Reserve s balance sheet reveals a number of facts  The Fed has over  11 billion in gold stock  certificates   which represents the Fed s financial interest in the statutory determined value of gold turned over to the U S  Treasury in accordance with the Gold Reserve Act on January 30  1934  166  The value reported here is based on a statutory valuation of  42 2 9 per fine troy ounce  As of March 2009  the market value of that gold is around  247 8 billion  The Fed holds more than  1 8 billion in coinage  not as a liability but as an asset  The Treasury Department is actually in charge of creating coins and U S  Notes  The Fed then buys coinage from the Treasury by increasing the liability assigned to the Treasury s account  The Fed holds at least  534 billion of the national debt  The  securities held outright  value used to directly represent the Fed s share of the national debt  but after the creation of new facilities in the winter of 2007 2008  this number has been reduced and the difference is shown with values from some of the new facilities  The Fed has no assets from overnight repurchase agreements  Repurchase agreements are the primary asset of choice for the Fed in dealing in the open market  Repo assets are bought by creating depository institution liabilities and directed to the bank the primary dealer uses when they sell into the open market  The more than  1 trillion in Federal Reserve Note liabilities represents nearly the total value of all dollar bills in existence  over  176 billion is held by the Fed  not in circulation   and the  net  figure of  863 billion represents the total face value of Federal Reserve Notes in circulation  The  916 billion in deposit liabilities of depository institutions shows that dollar bills are not the only source of government money  Banks can swap deposit liabilities of the Fed for Federal Reserve Notes back and forth as needed to match demand from customers  and the Fed can have the Bureau of Engraving and Printing create the paper bills as needed to match demand from banks for paper money  The amount of money printed has no relation to the growth of the monetary base  M0   The  93 5 billion in Treasury liabilities shows that the Treasury Department does not use private banks but rather uses the Fed directly  the lone exception to this rule is Treasury Tax and Loan because the government worries that pulling too much money out of the private banking system during tax time could be disruptive   citation needed  The  1 6 billion foreign liability represents the amount of foreign central bank deposits with the Federal Reserve  The  9 7 billion in  other liabilities and accrued dividends  represents partly the amount of money owed so far in the year to member banks for the 6  dividend on the 3  of their net capital they are required to contribute in exchange for nonvoting stock their regional Reserve Bank in order to become a member  Member banks are also subscribed for an additional 3  of their net capital  which can be called at the Federal Reserve s discretion  All nationally chartered banks must be members of a Federal Reserve Bank  and state chartered banks have the choice to become members or not  Total capital represents the profit the Fed has earned  which comes mostly from assets they purchase with the deposit and note liabilities they create  Excess capital is then turned over to the Treasury Department and Congress to be included into the Federal Budget as  Miscellaneous Revenue   In addition  the balance sheet also indicates which assets are held as collateral against Federal Reserve Notes  Federal Reserve Notes and Collateral Federal Reserve Notes Outstanding 1128 63    Less  Notes held by F R  Banks 200 90    Federal Reserve notes to be

dirty job  but someone has to do it   economist com  2007 12 13  http   www economist com displaystory cfm story id 10286586  Retrieved 2011 08 29   The Fed s discount window  for instance  through which it lends direct to banks  has barely been approached  despite the soaring spreads in the interbank market  The quarter point cuts in its federal funds rate and discount rate on December 11 were followed by a steep sell off in the stockmarket   The hope is that by extending the maturity of central bank money  broadening the range of collateral against which banks can borrow and shifting from direct lending to an auction  the central bankers will bring down spreads in the one  and three month money markets  There will be no net addition of liquidity  What the central bankers add at longer term maturities  they will take out in the overnight market  But there are risks  The first is that  for all the fanfare  the central banks  plan will make little difference  After all  it does nothing to remove the fundamental reason why investors are worried about lending to banks  This is the uncertainty about potential losses from subprime mortgages and the products based on them  and given that uncertainty the banks  own desire to hoard capital against the chance that they will have to strengthen their balance sheets       Unclogging the system   economist com  2007 12 13  http
