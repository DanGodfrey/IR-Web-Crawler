Cosmic ray From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search For the film  see Cosmic Ray  film    Cosmic radiation  redirects here  For some background types of cosmic radiation  see cosmic background radiation and cosmic background  This article includes a list of references  but its sources remain unclear because it has insufficient inline citations  Please help to improve this article by introducing more precise citations   September 2011  The energy spectrum for cosmic rays Cosmic rays are energetic charged subatomic particles  originating in outer space  They may produce secondary particles that penetrate the Earth s atmosphere and surface  The term ray is historical as cosmic rays were thought to be electromagnetic radiation  Most primary cosmic rays  those that enter the atmosphere from deep space  are composed of familiar stable subatomic particles that normally occur on Earth  such as protons  atomic nuclei  or electrons  However  a very small fraction are stable particles of antimatter  such as positrons or antiprotons  and the precise nature of this remaining fraction is an area of active research  About 89  of cosmic rays are simple protons or hydrogen nuclei  10  are helium nuclei or alpha particles  and 1  are the nuclei of heavier elements  These nuclei constitute 99  of the cosmic rays  Solitary electrons  much like beta particles  although their ultimate source is unknown  constitute much of the remaining 1   The variety of particle energies reflects the wide variety of sources  The origins range from processes on the Sun  and presumably other stars as well   to as yet unknown physical mechanisms in the farthest reaches of the observable universe  There is evidence that very high energy cosmic rays are produced over far longer periods than the explosion of a single star or sudden galactic event  suggesting multiple accelerating processes that cover very long distances with regard to the size of stars  The obscure mechanism of cosmic ray production at galactic distances is partly a result of the fact that  unlike other radiations  magnetic fields in our galaxy and other galaxies bend cosmic ray direction severely  so that they arrive nearly randomly from all directions  hiding any clue of the direction of their initial sources  Cosmic rays can have energies of over 1020 eV  far higher than the 1012 to 1013 eV that Terrestrial particle accelerators can produce  There has been interest in investigating cosmic rays of even greater energies  1  Cosmic rays are enriched in lithium  beryllium  and boron with regard to the relative abundance of these elements in the universe compared to hydrogen and helium  and thus are thought to have a primary role in the synthesis of these three elements through the process of  cosmic ray nucleosynthesis   They also produce some so called cosmogenic stable isotopes and radioisotopes on Earth  such as carbon 14  2  In the history of particle physics  cosmic rays were the source of the discovery of the positron  muon  and pi meson  Cosmic rays compose a part of natural background radiation on Earth  averaging about 10 15  of it  However  persons living at higher altitude can obtain several times more cosmic radiation than at sea level  and long distance airline crews can double their yearly ionizing radiation exposure due to this source citation needed   Since the intensity of cosmic rays is much larger outside the Earth s atmosphere and magnetic field  it is expected to have a major impact on the design of spacecraft that can safely transport humans in interplanetary space  Contents 1 Composition 2 Flux 3 Detection 3 1 Detection by particle track etch technique 3 2 Detection by air shower 4 Research and experiments 5 History 6 Effects 6 1

cosmic rays that originate from astrophysical sources are primary cosmic rays  these primary cosmic rays interact with interstellar matter creating secondary cosmic rays  The Sun also emits low energy cosmic rays associated with solar flares  Almost 90  of cosmic rays are protons  about 9  are helium nuclei  alpha particles  and nearly 1  are electrons  The ratio of hydrogen to helium nuclei  28   is about the same as the primordial elemental abundance ratio of these elements  24    citation needed  The remaining fraction is made up of the other heavier nuclei that are nuclear synthesis end products  products of the Big Bang  primarily lithium  beryllium  and boron  These light nuclei appear in cosmic rays in much greater abundance   1   than in the solar atmosphere  where their abundance is about 10 9  that of helium  This abundance difference is a result of the way secondary cosmic rays are formed  Carbon and oxygen nuclei collide with interstellar matter to form lithium  beryllium and boron in a process termed cosmic ray spallation  Spallation is also responsible for the abundances of scandium  titanium  vanadium  and manganese ions in cosmic rays produced by collisions of iron and nickel nuclei with interstellar matter  See Natural Environmental Radioactivity  Satellite experiments have found evidence of a few antiprotons and positrons in primary cosmic rays  although there is no evidence of complex antimatter atomic nuclei  such as anti helium nuclei  anti alpha  particles  Antiprotons arrive at Earth with a characteristic energy maximum of 2 GeV  indicating their production in a fundamentally different process from cosmic ray protons  3   edit  Flux The flux of incoming cosmic rays at the upper atmosphere is dependent on the solar wind  the Earth s magnetic field  and the energy of the cosmic rays  The solar wind decelerates the incoming particles and blocks some of the particles with energies below about 1 GeV  The amount of solar wind is not constant due to changes in solar activity  Thus  the level of the cosmic ray flux varies with solar activity  The Earth s magnetic field deflects some of the cosmic rays  giving rise to the observation that the flux is apparently dependent on latitude  longitude  and azimuth angle  The magnetic field lines deflect the cosmic rays towards the poles  giving rise to the aurora  At distances of  94 AU from the Sun  the solar wind undergoes a transition  called the termination shock  from supersonic to subsonic speeds  The region between the termination shock and the heliopause acts as a barrier to cosmic rays  decreasing the flux at lower energies by about 90   In the past  it was believed that the cosmic ray flux remained fairly constant over time  However  recent research suggests 1 5 to 2 fold millennium timescale changes in the cosmic ray flux in the past forty thousand years  4  The magnitude of the energy of cosmic ray flux in interstellar space is very comparable to that of other deep space energies  cosmic ray energy density averages about one electron volt per cubic centimeter of interstellar space  or  1 eV cm3  which is comparable to the energy density of visible starlight at 0 3 eV cm3  the galactic magnetic field energy density  assumed 3 microgauss  which is  0 25 eV cm3  or the cosmic microwave background  CMB  radiation energy density at   0 25 eV cm3  5  However  cosmic rays  unlike the other energy components above  are composed of ionizing particles  and this is far more damaging to biological processes than simple energies suggest  As noted below  cosmic rays make up on average 10 to 15  of background ionizing radiation to humans on Earth  but this component can be several times larger for persons living at higher altitudes   edit  Detection The Moon s cosmic ray shadow  as seen in secondary muons detected 700 m below ground  at the Soudan 2 detector The Moon as seen by the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory  in gamma rays of greater than 20 MeV  These are produced by cosmic ray bombardment of its surface  6  Cosmic rays collide with the nuclei of atmospheric gases  producing a shower of  among others  pions and kaons  that decay into muons  These muons are able to reach the surface of the Earth  and even penetrate for some distance into shallow mines  Muons are easily detected by many types of particle detectors such as cloud chambers or bubble chambers or scintillation detectors  Several muons observed by separated detectors at the same instant indicates that they have been produced in the same shower event  Cosmic rays impacting other planetary bodies in the Solar System are detected indirectly by observing high energy gamma ray emissions by gamma ray telescope  These are distinguished from radioactive decay processes by their higher energies above  about 10 MeV   edit  Detection by particle track etch technique Cosmic rays can also be detected directly by particle detectors aboard satellites or high altitude balloons  In a pioneering technique developed by Robert Fleischer  P  Buford Price  and Robert M  Walker  7  sheets of clear plastic  like 1 4 mil Lexan polycarbonate  are stacked together and exposed directly to cosmic rays in space or high altitude  The nuclear charge causes chemical bond breaking or ionization in the plastic  At the top of the plastic stack  the ionization is less due to the high cosmic ray speed  As the cosmic ray speed decreases due to deceleration in the stack  the ionization increases along the path  The resulting plastic sheets are  etched  or slowly dissolved in warm caustic sodium hydroxide solution  that removes the surface material at a slow  known rate  The caustic sodium hydroxide dissolves at a faster rate along the path of the ionized plastic  The net result is a conical shaped pit or etch pit in the plastic  The etch pits are measured under a high power microscope  typically 1600X oil immersion   and the etch rate is plotted as a function of the depth in the stacked plastic  This yields a unique curve for each atomic nucleus of Z from 1 to 92  allowing identification of both the charge and energy of the cosmic ray that traverses the plastic stack  The more extensive the ionization along the path  the higher the charge  This technique has been used with great success for detecting not only cosmic rays  but fission product nuclei for neutron detectors   edit  Detection by air shower When cosmic rays enter the Earth s atmosphere they collide with molecules  mainly oxygen and nitrogen  to produce a cascade of billions of lighter particles  a so called air shower  All of the produced particles stay within about one degree of the primary particle s path  Typical particles produced in such collisions are charged mesons e g  positive and negative pions and kaons  These subsequently decay into muons that are easily detected by many types of particle detectors   edit  Research and experiments See also

ionization of the air  was caused only by radiation from radioactive elements in the ground or the radioactive gases or isotopes of radon they produce  Measurements of ionization rates at increasing heights above the ground during the decade from 1900 to 1910 showed a decrease that could be explained as due to absorption of the ionizing radiation by the intervening air  In 1909 Theodor Wulf developed an electrometer  a device to measure the rate of ion production inside a hermetically sealed container  and used it to show higher levels of radiation at the top of the Eiffel Tower than at its base  However  his paper published in Physikalische Zeitschrift was not widely accepted  In 1911 Domenico Pacini observed simultaneous variations of the rate of ionization over a lake  over the sea  and at a depth of 3 meters from the surface  Pacini concluded from the decrease of radioactivity underwater that a certain part of the ionization must be due to sources other than the radioactivity of the Earth  8  Pacini makes a measurement in 1910  Then  in 1912  Victor Hess carried three enhanced accuracy Wulf electrometers 9  to an altitude of 5300 meters in a free balloon flight  He found the ionization rate increased approximately fourfold over the rate at ground level  9  Hess also ruled out the Sun as the radiation s source by making a balloon ascent during a near total eclipse  With the moon blocking much of the Sun s visible radiation  Hess still measured rising radiation at rising altitudes  9  He concluded  The results of my observation are best explained by the assumption that a radiation of very great penetrating power enters our atmosphere from above   In 1913 1914  Werner Kolh rster confirmed Victor Hess  earlier results by measuring the increased ionization rate at an altitude of 9 km  Increase of ionization with altitude as measured by Hess in 1912  left  and by Kolh rster  right  Hess received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936 for his discovery  10  11  Hess lands after his balloon flight in 1912  In the 1920s the term  cosmic rays  was coined by Robert Millikan who made measurements of ionization due to cosmic rays from deep under water to high altitudes and around the globe  Millikan believed that his measurements proved that the primary cosmic rays were gamma rays  i e   energetic photons  And he proposed a theory that they were produced in interstellar space as by products of the fusion of hydrogen atoms into the heavier elements  and that secondary electrons were produced in the atmosphere by Compton scattering of gamma rays  But then  in 1927  J  Clay found evidence  J  Clay  Proc  Acad  Wetesch   Amsterdam  30 633  1927    later confirmed in many experiments  of a variation of cosmic ray intensity with latitude  which indicated that the primary cosmic rays are deflected by the geomagnetic field and must therefore be charged particles  not photons  In 1929 Bothe and Kohlh rster  W  Bothe  amp  W  Kohlh rster  Zeitschrift f r Physik  36 751  1929   discovered charged cosmic ray particles that could penetrate 4 1 cm of gold  Charged particles of such high energy could not possibly be produced by photons from Millikan s interstellar fusion process  In 1930  Bruno Rossi  B  Rossi  Phys  Rev  36 606  1930   predicted a difference between the intensities of cosmic rays arriving from the east and the west that depends upon the charge of the primary particles   the so called  east west effect   Three independent experiments  T  H  Johnson  Phys  Rev   43 834  1934   L  Alvarez  amp  A  H  Compton  Phys  Rev   43 835  1934   B  Rossi  Phys  Rev   45 212  1934   found that the intensity is  in fact  greater from the west  proving that most primaries are positive  During the years from 1930 to 1945  a wide variety of investigations confirmed that the primary cosmic rays are mostly protons  and the secondary radiation produced in the atmosphere is primarily electrons  photons and muons  In 1948  observations with nuclear emulsions carried by balloons to near the top of the atmosphere  P  Frier et al  Phys  Rev  74 213  1948    H  L  Bradt  amp  B  Peters  Phys  Rev   74 1828  1948   showed that approximately 10  of the primaries are helium nuclei  alpha particles  and 1  are heavier nuclei of the elements such as carbon  iron  and lead  During a test of his equipment for measuring the east west effect  Rossi observed that the rate of near simultaneous discharges of two widely separatedGeiger counters was larger than the expected accidental rate  In his report on the experiment  Rossi wrote  B  Rossi  Ric  Sci  5 1  579  1934       it seems that once in a while the recording equipment is struck by very extensive showers of particles  which causes coincidences between the counters  even placed at large distances from one another   In 1937 Pierre Auger  unaware of Rossi s earlier report  detected the same phenomenon and investigated it in some detail  He concluded that high energy primary cosmic ray particles interact with air nuclei high in the atmosphere  initiating a cascade of secondary interactions that ultimately yield a shower of electrons  and photons that reach ground level  Soviet physicist Sergey Vernov was the first to use radiosondes to perform cosmic ray readings with an instrument carried to high altitude by a balloon  On April 1  1935  he took measurements at heights up to 13 6 kilometers using a pair of Geiger counters in an anti coincidence circuit to avoid counting secondary ray showers  12  13  Homi J  Bhabha derived an expression for the probability of scattering positrons by electrons  a process now known as Bhabha scattering  His classic paper  jointly with Walter Heitler  published in 1937 described how primary cosmic rays from space interact with the upper atmosphere to produce particles observed at the ground level  Bhabha and Heitler explained the cosmic ray shower formation by the cascade production of gamma rays and positive and negative electron pairs  Measurements of the energy and arrival directions of the ultra high energy primary cosmic rays by the techniques of  density sampling  and  fast timing  of extensive air showers were first carried out in 1954 by members of the Rossi Cosmic Ray Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology   G  Clark et al  Phys  Rev   122 637  1961    The experiment employed eleven scintillation detectors arranged within a circle 460 meters in diameter on the grounds of the Agassiz Station of the Harvard College Observatory  From that work  and from many other experiments carried out all over the world  the energy spectrum of the primary cosmic rays is now known to extend beyond 1020 eV  A huge air shower experiment called the Auger Project is currently operated at a site on the pampas of Argentina by an international consortium of physicists  led by James Cronin  1980 Nobel Prize in Physics of the University of Chicago and Alan Watson of the University of Leeds  Their aim is to explore the properties and arrival directions of the very highest energy primary cosmic rays  The results are expected to have important implications for particle physics and cosmology  due to a theoretical Greisen Zatsepin Kuzmin limit to the energies of cosmic rays from long distances  about 160 million light years  which occurs above 1020 eV because of interactions with the remnant photons from the big bang origin of the universe  In November  2007 preliminary results were announced showing direction of origination of the 27 highest energy events were strongly correlated with the locations of active galactic nuclei  AGN   where bare protons are believed to be accelerated by strong magnetic fields associated with the large black holes at the AGN centers to energies of 1020 eV and higher  High energy gamma rays   gt 50 MeV photons  were finally discovered in the primary cosmic radiation by an MIT experiment carried on the OSO 3 satellite in 1967  W  Kraushaar et al   Ap  J   177 341  1972    Components of both galactic and an extra galactic origins were separately identified at intensities much less than 1  of the primary charged particles  Since then  numerous satellite gamma ray observatories have mapped the gamma ray sky  The most recent is the Fermi Observatory  which has produced a map showing a narrow band of gamma rays intensity produced in discrete and diffuse sources in our galaxy  and numerous point like extra galactic sources distributed over the celestial sphere   edit  Effects  edit  Changes in atmospheric chemistry Cosmic rays ionize the nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the atmosphere  which leads to a number of chemical reactions  One of the reactions results in ozone depletion  Cosmic rays are also responsible for the continuous production of a number of unstable isotopes in the Earth s atmosphere  such as carbon 14  via the reaction  n   14N   p   14C Cosmic rays kept the level of carbon 14  2  in the atmosphere roughly constant  70 tons  for at least the past 100 000 years  until the beginning of above ground nuclear weapons testing in the early 1950s  This is an important fact used in

averaging 0 39 mSv out of a total of 3 mSv per year  13  of total background  for the Earth s population  However  the background due to cosmic rays can vary from 0 3 mSv year at sea level to 1 0 mSv per year in high altitude cities  which would raise cosmic radiation exposure to a quarter of the total background  Airline crews flying long distance high altitude routes can be exposed to 2 2 mSv of extra radiation each year due to cosmic rays  which nearly doubles their total ionizing radiation exposure  The following table compares cosmic radiation doses to other sources of background radiation

Nuclear Plant Accident  Human made values at UNCEAR are from Japan NIRS which summarized UNCEAR data   edit  Effect on electronics Cosmic rays have sufficient energy to alter the states of elements in electronic integrated circuits  causing transient errors to occur  such as corrupted data in electronic memory devices  or incorrect performance of CPUs  often referred to as  soft errors   not to be confused with software errors caused by programming mistakes bugs   This has been a problem in extremely high altitude electronics  such as in satellites  but with transistors becoming smaller and smaller  this is becoming an increasing concern in ground level electronics as well  20  Studies by IBM in the 1990s suggest that computers typically experience about one cosmic ray induced error per 256 megabytes of RAM per month  21  To alleviate this problem  the Intel Corporation has proposed a cosmic ray detector that could be integrated into future high density microprocessors  allowing the processor to repeat the last command following a cosmic ray event  22  Cosmic rays are suspected as a possible cause of an in flight incident in 2008 where an Airbus A330 airliner of Qantas twice plunged hundreds of feet after an unexplained malfunction in its flight control system  Many passengers and crew members were injured  some seriously  After this incident  the accident investigators determined that the airliner s flight control system had received a data spike that could not be explained  and that all systems were in perfect working order  This has prompted a software upgrade to all A330 and A340 airliners  worldwide  so that any data spikes in this system are filtered out electronically  23   edit  Significance to space travel Main article  Health threat from cosmic rays Galactic cosmic rays are one of the most important barriers standing in the way of plans for interplanetary travel by crewed spacecraft  Cosmic Rays also place a threat to electronics placed aboard outgoing probes  In 2010  a malfunction aboard the Voyager 2 space probe was credited to a single flipped bit  probably caused by a cosmic ray   edit  Role in lightning Cosmic rays have been implicated in the triggering of electrical breakdown in lightning  It has been proposed that essentially all lightning is triggered through a relativistic process   runaway breakdown   seeded by cosmic ray secondaries  Subsequent development of the lightning discharge then occurs through  conventional breakdown  mechanisms  24   edit  Role in climate change A role of cosmic rays directly or via solar induced modulations in climate change was suggested by Edward P  Ney in 1959 25  and by Robert Dickinson in 1975  In recent years  the idea has been revived most notably by Henrik Svensmark  the most recent IPCC study disputed the mechanism  26  while the most comprehensive review of the topic to date states   evidence for the cosmic ray forcing is increasing as is the understanding of its physical principles   27   edit  Suggested mechanisms Henrik Svensmark et al  have argued that solar variations modulate the cosmic ray signal seen at the Earth and that this would affect cloud formation and hence climate  Cosmic rays have been experimentally determined capable of producing ultra small aerosol particles  28  orders of magnitude smaller than cloud condensation nuclei  CCN   According to a report about an ongoing CERN CLOUD research project 29  to detect any Cosmic ray forcing is challenging since on wide spread time scales changes in the Sun s magnetic activity  Earth s magnetic field  and the galactic environment must be taken into account  Empirically  increased galactic cosmic ray  GCR  flux seem to be associated with a cooler climate  a southerly shift of the ITCZ  Inter Tropical Convergence Zone  citation needed  and a weakening of monsoon rainfalls and vice versa  29  Claims have been made of identification of GCR climate signals in atmospheric parameters such as high latitude precipitation  Todd  amp  Kniveton   and Svensmark s annual cloud cover variations  which were said to be correlated to GCR variation  Various proposals have been made for the mechanism by which cosmic rays might affect clouds  including ion mediated nucleation  and indirect effects on current flow density in the global electric circuit  see Tinsley 2000  and F  Yu 1999      Other studies refer to the formation of relatively highly charged aerosols and cloud droplets at cloud boundaries  with an indirect effect on ice particle formation and altering aerosol interaction with cloud droplets  29  Kirkby  2009  reviews developments and describes further cloud nucleation mechanisms that appear energetically favorable and depend on GCRs   30  31   edit  Geochemical and astrophysical evidence Carbon dioxide concentrations on 500 million year scale 32  Climate change on 500 million year scale Nir Shaviv has argued that climate signals on geological time scales are attributable to changing positions of the galactic spiral arms of the Milky Way Galaxy  and that cosmic ray flux variability is the dominant  climate driver  over these time periods  33  Nir Shaviv and Jan Veizer in 2003 34  argue  that in contrast to a carbon based scenario  the model and proxy based estimates of atmospheric CO2 levels especially for the early Phanerozoic  see diagrams  do not show correlation with the paleoclimate picture that emerged from geological criteria  while cosmic ray flux would do  The 2007 IPCC reports  however  strongly attribute a major role of anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the ongoing global warming  but as  different climate changes in the past had different causes  a driving role of carbon dioxide in the geological past is neither focus of the IPCC nor purported  Similarly  according a BBC report a 2008 Lancaster University study produced  further compelling evidence showing that modern day climate change is not caused by changes in the Sun s activity   35  A comprehensive study of different research institutes was published 2007 by Scherer et al  in Space Science Reviews 2007  36  The study combines geochemical evidence both on temperature  cosmic rays influence and as well astrophysical deliberations suggesting a major role in climate variability over different geological time scales  Proxy data of CRF influence comprise among others isotopic evidence in sediments on the Earth and as well changes in  iron  meteorites   edit  See also Environmental radioactivity Cosmic ray spallation Forbush decrease
