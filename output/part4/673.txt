History The earliest traces of human presence in New Caledonia date back to the Lapita period  9  The Lapita were highly skilled navigators and agriculturists with influence over a large area of the Pacific  10  The British first sighted New Caledonia on September 4  1774  during the second voyage of Captain James Cook  11  He named the territory New Caledonia  as the north east of the island reminded him of Scotland  11  The west coast of Grande Terre was approached by Jean Fran ois de Galaup  comte de Lap rouse in 1788  shortly before his disappearance  and the Loyalty Islands were first visited in 1796  11  From then until 1840  only a few sporadic contacts with the archipelago were recorded  11  Contacts became more frequent after 1840  because of the interest in sandalwood from New Caledonia  9  As trade in sandalwood declined  it was replaced by a new form of trade   Blackbirding   a euphemism for enslaving people from New Caledonia  the Loyalty Islands  New Hebrides  New Guinea  and the Solomon Islands to work in sugar cane plantations in Fiji and Queensland  12  The trade ceased at the start of the 20th century  12  The victims of this trade were called Kanakas like all the Oceanian people  after the Hawaiian word for  man   12  The first missionaries from the London Missionary Society and the Marist Brothers arrived in the 1840s  13  In 1849  the crew of the American ship Cutter was killed and eaten by the Pouma clan  14 Cannibalism was widespread throughout New Caledonia  15  Two Kanak warriors posing with penis gourds and spears  c 1880 On September 24  1853  under orders from Napoleon III  Admiral Febvrier Despointes took formal possession of New Caledonia and Port de France  Noum a  was founded June 25  1854  11  A few dozen free settlers settled on the west coast in the following years  11  New Caledonia became a penal colony  and from the 1860s until the end of the transportations in 1897  about 22 000 criminals and political prisoners were sent to New Caledonia  among them many Communards  including Henri de Rochefort and Louise Michel  16  Between 1873 and 1876  4 200 political prisoners were  relegated  in New Caledonia  11  Only forty of them settled in the colony  the rest returned to France after being granted amnesty in 1879 and 1880  11  Chief  King Jacques  and his wives In 1864 nickel was discovered on the banks of the Diahot River and with the establishment of the Soci t  Le Nickel in 1876 mining began in earnest  17  The French imported labourers to work in the mines  first from neighbouring islands  then from Japan  the Dutch East Indies and French Indochina  16  The French government also attempted to encourage European immigration  without much success  16  The indigenous population was excluded from the French economy  even as workers in the mines  and they were ultimately confined to reservations  16  This sparked a violent reaction in 1878 as High Chief Atal of La Foa managed to unite many of the central tribes and launched a guerrilla war which cost 200 Frenchmen and 1 000 Kanaks their lives  17  The Kanak population declined from around 60 000 in 1878 to 27 100 in 1921  and their numbers did not increase again until the 1930s  17  In June 1940  after the fall of France  the Conseil General of New Caledonia voted unanimously to support the Free French government  and in September the pro Vichy governor was forced to leave for Indochina  17  In March 1942  with the assistance of Australia  18  the territory became an important Allied base  17  and Noum a the headquarters of the United States Navy and Army in the South Pacific  19  The fleet which turned back the Japanese navy in the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942 was based at Noumea  17  American troops counted up to 50 000 men  the equivalent of the contemporary population  11  In 1946 New Caledonia became an overseas territory  11  By 1953 French citizenship had been granted to all New Caledonians  regardless of ethnicity  20  The European and Polynesian populations gradually increased in the years leading to the nickel boom of 1969 72  and the Melanesians became a minority  though they were still the largest single ethnic group  20  Between 1976 and 1988  New Caledonia adopted five different statutes  with each proving to be a source of discontent and  at times  serious disorder  11  culminating in 1988 with a bloody hostage taking in Ouv a  The Matignon Agreements  signed on June 26  1988  ensured a decade of stability  The Noumea Accord signed May 5  1998  set the groundwork for a 20 year transitional period that will gradually transfer competences to the local government  11   edit  Politics Main article  Politics of New Caledonia Logo of the Territorial Congress New Caledonia is a sui generis collectivity that has been gradually transferred certain powers from France  21  It is governed by a 54 member Territorial Congress  a legislative body composed of members of three provincial assemblies  22  The French State is represented in the territory by a High Commissioner  22  At a national level  New Caledonia is represented in the National Assembly by two deputies and a senator  23  At the 2007 French presidential election the voter turnout in New Caledonia was 68 14   24  For 25 years  the party system in New Caledonia was dominated by the anti independence The Rally UMP  22  This dominance ended with the emergence of a new party  Avenir Ensemble  also opposed to independence but considered more open to dialogue with the Kanak movement  22  which is part of FLNKS  a coalition of several pro independence groups  22   edit  Customary authority The Kanak society has several layers of customary authority  from the 4 000 5 000 family based clans to the eight customary areas  aires coutumi res  that make up the territory  25  Clans are led by clan chiefs and constitute 341 tribes  each headed by a tribal chief  The tribes are further grouped into 57 customary chiefdoms  chefferies   each headed by a Head Chief  and forming the administrative subdivisions of the customary areas  25  Jean L ques during a ceremony honoring U S  service members who helped ensure the freedom of New Caledonia during World War II  The Customary Senate is the assembly of the various traditional councils of the Kanaks  and has jurisdiction over the law proposals concerning the Kanak identity  26  The Customary Senate is composed of sixteen members appointed by each traditional council  with two representatives per each customary area  26  In its advisory role  the Customary Senate must be consulted on law proposals  concerning the Kanak identity  as defined in the Noumea Accord  26  It also has a deliberative role on law proposals that would affect identity  the civil customary statute and the land system  26  A new President is appointed each year in August or September  and the presidency rotates between the eight customary areas  26  Kanak people recourse to customary authorities regarding civil matters such as marriage  adoption  inheritance  and some land issues  25  The French administration typically respects decisions made in the customary system  25  However  their jurisdiction is sharply limited in penal matters  as some elements of the customary justice system  including the use of corporal punishment  are seen as clashing with the human rights obligations of France  25   edit  Military The Armed Forces of New Caledonia  French  Forces arm es de Nouvelle Cal donie  include about 2 000 soldiers  mainly deployed in Koumac  Nandi  Tontouta  Plum and Noumea  27  The land forces consist of a regiment of the Troupes de marine  the R giment d infanterie de marine du Pacifique  The naval forces include two P400 class patrol vessels  a BATRAL and a patrol boat of the Maritime Gendarmerie  27  The air force is made up of three Casa transport aircraft  four Puma helicopters and a Fennec helicopter  based in Tontouta  27  In addition  760 gendarmes are deployed on the archipelago  27   edit  Status Second official national flag Since 1986 the United Nations Committee on Decolonization has included New Caledonia on the United Nations list of Non Self Governing Territories  citation needed  Under the Noumea Accord  signed in 1998 following a period of secessionist unrest in the 1980s  New Caledonia is to hold a referendum on independence between 2014 and 2018  28  The official name of the territory  Nouvelle Cal donie  could be changed in the near future due to the accord  which stated that  a name  a flag  an anthem  a motto  and the design of banknotes will have to be sought by all parties together  to express the Kanak identity and the future shared by all parties   29  To date  however  there has been no consensus on a new name for the territory  30  New Caledonia has increasingly adopted its own symbols  choosing an anthem  a motto  and a new design for its banknotes  31  In July 2010  New Caledonia adopted the Kanak flag  alongside the existing French tricolor  as the dual official flags of the territory  32  The adoption made New Caledonia one of the few countries or territories in the world with two official national flags  32  The decision to use two flags has been a constant battleground between the two sides and led the coalition government to collapse in February 2011  28

super continent  Zealandia separated from Australia 60 85 million years ago  33  New Caledonia itself separated from Australia 65 million years ago  subsequently drifting in a north easterly direction  reaching its present position about 50 million years ago  34  The mainland is divided in length by a central mountain range whose highest peak are Mount Pani   1629 m  in the north and Mount Humboldt  1618 m  in the southeast  35  The east coast is covered by a lush vegetation  35  The west coast  with its large savannahs and plains suitable for farming  is a drier area  Many ore rich massifs are found along this coast  35  The Diahot River is the longest river of New Caledonia  flowing for some 100 kilometres  62 mi   36  It has a catchment area of 620 square kilometres and opens north westward into the Baie d Harcourt  flowing towards the northern point of the island along the western escarpment of the Mount Pani   36  37  Most of the island is covered by wet evergreen forests  while savannahs dominate the lower elevations  38  The New Caledonian lagoon  with a total area of   24 000 square kilometers is one of the largest lagoons in the world  It is surrounded by the New Caledonia Barrier Reef  35  New Caledonia from space  edit  Climate The climate is tropical  with hot and humid period from November to March with temperatures between 27 C and 30 C  35  and a cooler  dry period from June to August with temperatures between 20 C and 23 C  35  linked by two short transition periods  11  The tropical climate is strongly moderated by the oceanic influence and the trade winds that attenuates humidity  which can be close to 80   35  The average annual temperature is 23 C  with historical extremes of 2 3 C and 39 1 C  11  The rainfall records show that precipitations differ greatly within the island  The 3000 mm of rainfall recorded in Galarino are three times the average of the west coast  There are also dry periods  because of the effects of El Ni o  11  Between December and April  tropical depressions and cyclones can cause winds to exceed a speed of 100 km h with gusts of 250 km h and very abundant rainfall  11  The last cyclone affecting New Caledonia was Cyclone Vania  2011   in January 2011   edit  Environment See also  Biodiversity of New Caledonia La Poule  the hen  in Hiengh ne  New Caledonia has many unique plants and animals

abuses   41   edit  Flora Typical terrain in the south of the islands at Grand Terre With 44 species in five generas  New Caledonia is the tropical country with the highest concentration of Gymnosperms  Of the 44 species of gymnosperms  43 are endemic  including the only known parasite Gymnosperm  Parasitaxus usta   42  It is one of five regions the world in which the Nothofagus still exists  with five species  42  Shrubby vegetation  maquis minier  occurs on metalliferous soils  mostly in the south  38  The soils of ultramafic rocks  mining terrains  have been a refuge for many native flora species because they are toxic and inadequately mineralized for most foreign species  42  Of the 35 araucaria tree species recorded worldwide  13 are endemic to New Caledonia  39  The largest fern of New Caledonia is the Cyathea intermedia  it can reach 30 m and is the largest known on earth  Cyathea intermedia is endemic but very common on acid ground  it grows at a speed of 1 m per year on the east coast  usually in the fallow or forest openings  There are also Cyathea novae caledoniae  43   edit  Fauna The endemic Kagu bird New Caledonia is home to the New Caledonian crow  a bird noted for its tool making abilities  which rival that of primates  44  These crows are renowned for their extraordinary intelligence and ability to fashion tools to solve problems  and make the most complex tools of any animal yet studied apart from humans  45  The endemic Kagu  agile and able to run fast  is a flightless bird  but it is able to use its wings to climb branches or glide  It is the surviving member of monotypic family Rhynochetidae  order Gruiformes  46  There are 11 endemic fish species and 14 endemic species of decapod crustaceans in the rivers and lakes of New

the establishment of French settlements  and French is now spoken even in the most secluded villages  The level of fluency  however  varies significantly across the population as a whole  primarily due to the absence of universal access to public education before 1953  but also due to immigration and ethnic diversity  55  At the 2009 census  97 3  of people aged 15 or older reported that they could speak  read and write French  whereas only 1 1  reported that they had no knowledge of French  56  The 28 Kanak languages  spoken in New Caledonia are part of the Oceanic group of the

New Zealand  though there is significant inequality in income distribution  59  and long standing structural imbalances between the economically dominant South Province and the less developed North Province and Loyalty Islands  22  The currency in use in New Caledonia is the CFP franc  pegged to the euro at a rate of 100 CFP to 0 84 euros  It is issued by the Institut d Emission d Outre Mer  60  GDP grew by only 1 1  in 2009  a result affected by a contraction of domestic demand and a deflationary situation brought about by a drastic fall in nickel prices  61  In the same year  GDP per capita stood at 3 1 million CFP francs  61  Financial support from France is substantial  representing more than 15  of the GDP  and contributes to the health of the economy  2  Tourism is underdeveloped

Caledonian soils contain about 25  of the world s nickel resources  64  The late 2000s recession has gravely affected the nickel industry  as the sector faced a significant drop in nickel prices   31 0  year on year in 2009  for the second consecutive year  61  The fall in prices has led a number of producers to reduce or stop altogether their activity  resulting in a reduction of the global supply of nickel by 6  compared to 2008  61  This context  combined with bad weather has forced the operators in the sector to revise downwards their production target  61  Thus  the activity of mineral extraction has declined by 8  in volume year on year  61  The share of the nickel sector as a percentage of GDP fell 3   to 5  in 2009 compared with 8  in 2008  61  A trend reversal and a
