series entitled The Adventures of Apocalypse Al for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that was to debut in 2007 but has not yet aired   edit  Television  edit  Animation Straczynski was a fan of the cartoon  He Man and the Masters of the Universe  He wrote a spec script in 1984 and sent it directly to Filmation  17  They purchased his script  bought several others  and hired him on staff  During this time he became friends with Larry DiTillio  and when Filmation produced the He Man spinoff  She Ra  Princess of Power  they both worked as story editors on the show  18  19  However  Filmation refused to give them credit on screen and Straczynski and DiTillio both left and found work with DIC on Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors  Straczynski and DiTillio also worked to create an animated version of Elfquest but that project soon fell through when CBS attempted to retool the show to appeal to younger audiences  20  While working on Jayce  Straczynski was hired to come aboard the Len Janson and Chuck Menville project to adapt the movie Ghostbusters to an animated version called The Real Ghostbusters  When Janson and Menville learned that there was not only a 13 episode order but a 65 episode syndication order as well  they decided that the workload was too much and that they would only work on their own scripts  21  DIC head Jean Chalopin asked Straczynski to take on the task of story editing the entire 78 episode block as well as writing his own scripts  21  After the show s successful first season  consultants were brought in to make suggestions for the show  including changing Janine to a more maternal character  giving every character a particular  job   Peter is the funny one  Egon is the smart one  and Winston  the only black character  was to be the driver   and to add kids into the show  21  Straczynski left at this point and Janson and Menville took on the story editing job for the second network season  Straczynski then developed a show called Spiral Zone but left after only one script when his concept for the show was drastically altered and took his name off the series  22  substituting the pseudonym  Fettes Grey   derived from the names of the grave robbers in The Body Snatcher   Straczynski also wrote for CBS Storybreak  writing an adaptation of Evelyn Sibley Lampman s The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek    edit  Live action and the 1988 Writer s Strike After leaving animation  Straczynski freelanced for The Twilight Zone writing an episode entitled   What Are Friends For    and for Shelley Duvall s Nightmare Classics  adaptating The Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  which was nominated for a Writer s Guild Award   Straczynski was then offered the position of story editor on the syndicated live action science fiction series Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future  Straczynski constructed a season long arc with lasting character changes and wrote a third of the scripts himself  After one season  the toy company Mattel demanded more input into the show  causing Straczynski to quit  He recommended DiTillio to take over the job as story editor for a second season  but the toy company financing fell through and that season was never produced  23  Soon after  the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike began  Straczynski met Harlan Ellison during this time and would later become friends with him  24  25  After the strike ended  the producers of the new Twilight Zone needed to create more episodes to be able to sell the series into syndication with a complete 65 episode package  They hired Straczynski as executive story editor to fill in the remaining number of needed episodes  Straczynski wrote many of the scripts himself  In addition  one episode   Crazy as a Soup Sandwich   was written by Ellison   edit  Network shows and Babylon 5 After leaving Twilight Zone  his agent of the time asked him to pitch for the show Jake and the Fatman  26  Initially wary  Straczynski finally did and was hired on as story editor under Jeri Taylor and David Moessinger  When Taylor and Moessinger left the show  Straczynski left as well in solidarity with them  27  When Moessinger was hired as executive producer for Murder  She Wrote  he offered Straczynski a job as co producer  Straczynski joined Murder for two seasons and wrote 7 produced episodes  Moessinger and Straczynski moved the protagonist  Jessica Fletcher  from the sleepy Maine town of Cabot Cove to New York City to revitalize the show  The move effectively brought the show back into the top ten from the mid thirties where it had fallen  Straczynski made Jessica an instructor in writing and criminology  and he emphasized her role as a working writer  with all the deadlines and problems involved in that profession  Straczynski also wrote one episode of Walker  Texas Ranger for Moessinger between the pilot and first season of B5  28  In late 1991  Warner Bros  contracted with Doug Netter and Straczynski as partners to produce the show Babylon 5 as the flagship program for the new Prime Time Entertainment Network  29  Straczynski and Netter hired many of the people from Captain Power  as well as hiring Ellison as a consultant and DiTillio as a story editor  Babylon 5 won two Emmy Awards  back to back Hugo Awards  and dozens of other awards  Straczynski wrote 92 of the 110 episodes  as well as the pilot and five television movies  The show concentrated on character driven space opera  emphasis on realism  and it pioneered extensive use of CGI for its special effects  The show ran for its planned 5 season run but its sequel Crusade was the victim of TNT Network Executive interference  and only 13 episodes were commissioned  ending production even before the first episode had aired  In 2005  Straczynski began publishing his Babylon 5 scripts  30  This process ended in June 2008  with the scripts no longer being available from the end of July of that year  His scripts for the television movies were published for a limited time in January 2009  31   edit  Recent Television Projects Straczynski s most recent television series was Jeremiah  loosely based on the Belgian post apocalyptic comic of the same name  Straczynski ran the series for two seasons but was frustrated with the conflicting directions that MGM and Showtime wanted from the show  32  and even used the pseudonym  Fettes Grey  for the first time since Spiral Zone on one of the scripts  In the second season  Straczynski decided to leave the show if things did not improve  33  and the show ended after 2 seasons  In 2004  Straczynski was approached by Paramount Studios to become a producer of the Star Trek  Enterprise series  He declined  believing that he would not be allowed to take the show in the direction he felt it should go  34  He did write a treatment for a new Star Trek series with colleague Bryce Zabel  35  Straczynski also wrote and produced the pilot Babylon 5  The Legend of the
