distribution of population by age and sex than would otherwise be expected  Swaziland  officially the Kingdom of Swaziland  Umbuso weSwatini   and sometimes called Ngwane or Swatini  is a landlocked country in Southern Africa  bordered to the north  south and west by South Africa  and to the east by Mozambique  The nation  as well as its people  are named after the 19th century king Mswati II  Swaziland is a small country  no more than 200 kilometres  120 mi  north to south and 130 kilometres  81 mi  east to west  The western half is mountainous  descending to a lowveld region to the east  The eastern border with Mozambique and South Africa is dominated by the escarpment of the Lebombo Mountains  The climate is temperate in the west  but may reach 40  C  104  F  in summer in the lowveld  Rainfall occurs mainly in the summer and may reach 2 metres  6 6 ft  in the west  The area that Swaziland now covers has been continuously inhabited since prehistory  Today  the population is primarily ethnic Swazis whose language is siSwati  though English is spoken as a second language  The Swazi people descend from the southern Bantu who migrated from Central Africa in the 15th and 16th centuries  The Anglo Boer War saw the United Kingdom make Swaziland a protectorate under its direct control  Swaziland gained independence in 1968  Swaziland is a member of the Southern African Development Community  the African Union  and the Commonwealth of Nations  The head of state is the king  who appoints the prime minister and a small number of representatives for both chambers of parliament  Elections are held every five years to determine the majority of the representatives  A new constitution was adopted in 2005  Some 75  of the population are employed in subsistence farming  and 60  of the population live on less than the equivalent of US 1 25 per day  4  Swaziland s main trading partner is South Africa  and its currency is pegged to the South African rand  Swaziland s economic growth and societal integrity is highly endangered by its disastrous HIV epidemic  to an extent where the United Nations Development Program has written that if it continues unabated  the  longer term existence of Swaziland as a country will be seriously threatened   5  The infection rate in the country is unprecedented and the highest in the world at 26 1  of adults  6  and over 50  of adults in their 20s  5  Contents 1 History 2 Government 3 Administrative divisions 4 Geography 5 Climate 6 Economy 7 Health 8 Culture 8 1 Education 9 Demographics 9 1 Languages 9 2 Religions 10 See

human activity dating back to the early Stone Age 200 000 years ago have been found in the Kingdom of Swaziland  Prehistoric rock art paintings date from ca  25 000 B C  and continue up to the 19th century  The earliest inhabitants of the area were Khoisan hunter gatherers They were largely replaced by the Bantu tribes during Bantu migrations who hailed from the Great Lakes regions of Eastern Africa  Evidence of agriculture and iron use dates from about the 4th century and people speaking languages ancestral to current Sotho and Nguni languages began settling no later than the 11th century  The Bantu people known as the Swazis established iron working and settled farming colonies in the 15th century after crossing the Limpopo river  They experienced great economic pressure from the rival Ndwandwe clans from the south  7  The country derives its name from a later king  Mswati I  However  Ngwane is an alternative name for Swaziland and Dlamini remains the surname of the royal house  while Nkosi means  king   Scholarly history of Swaziland shows that independent chiefdoms and small kingdoms dominated by various clans were initially conquered and incorporated into the growing Ngwane kingdom ruled by members of the Dlamini clan sometime in the 18th and 19th centuries  long before British colonisation  8  According to Swazi royalist tradition  these clans came to be classified in the Dlamini kingdom as the Emakhandzambile category of clans   those found ahead   e g  the Gamedze   meaning that they were on the land prior to Dlamini immigration and conquest  as opposed to the Bomdzabuko   true Swazi   who accompanied the Dlamini kings  and the Emafikemuva   those who came behind   who joined the kingdom later  Emakhandzambile clans initially were incorporated with wide autonomy  and often in part by granting them special ritual and political status  cf  mediatisation   but the extent of their autonomy was drastically curtailed by King Mswati II  who attacked and subdued some of the clans in the 1850s  8  The autonomy of the Swaziland Nation was dictated by British rule of southern Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries  In 1881 the British government signed a convention recognizing Swazi independence  However  controversial land and mineral rights concessions were made under the authority of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act of 1890 in terms of which the administration of Swaziland was also placed under that of the then South African Republic  Transvaal   Swaziland was indirectly involved in the Second Boer War  1899 1902   The Swaziland independence Constitution was promulgated by Britain in November 1963 in terms of which a legislative Council and an Executive Council were established  This development was opposed by the Swazi National Council  liqoqo   Despite such opposition  elections took place and the first Legislative Council of Swaziland was constituted on 9 September 1964  Changes to the original constitution proposed by the Legislative Council were accepted by Britain and a new Constitution providing for a House of Assembly and Senate was drawn up  Elections under this Constitution were held in 1967  Since 1973  Swaziland has seen a rather quiet struggle between pro multiparty activists and supporters of the current Tinkhundla  constituencies  System of governance or Grass Roots Democracy System

relations of Swaziland and Military of Swaziland Embassy of Swaziland in Washington  D C  USA The head of state is the king or Ngwenyama  lit  Lion   currently King Mswati III  who ascended to the throne in 1986 after the death of his father King Sobhuza II in 1982 and a period of regency  By tradition  the king reigns along with his mother or a ritual substitute  the Ndlovukati  lit  She Elephant   The former was viewed as the administrative head of state and the latter as a spiritual and national head of state  with real power counter balancing that of the king  but during the long reign of Sobhuza II the role of the Ndlovukati became more symbolic  The king appoints the prime minister from the legislature and also appoints a minority of legislators to both chambers of Libandla  parliament   with help from an advisory council  The king is allowed by the constitution to appoint some members to parliament for special interests  These special interests are citizens who might have been left out by the electorate during the course of elections or did not enter as candidates  This is done in order to balance views in parliament  Special interests could be people of gender  race  disability  business community  civic society  scholars  chiefs and so on  The Senate consists of 30 members which some are appointed by the king on recommendation of the advisory council and others elected by the lower house  The House of Assembly has 65 seats  55 of which are occupied by elected representatives from the 55 constituencies around the country  10 appointed by the king on recommendation of the advisory council and the attorney general is the ex officio member  Elections are held every five years  In 1968  Swaziland adopted a Westminster style constitution  but in 1973 King Sobhuza II on the advice of parliament at the time suspended it due to widespread complaints by citizens of the country  In 2001  King Mswati III appointed a committee to draft a new constitution  Drafts were released for comment in May 1999 and November 2000  These were strongly criticized by civil society organizations in Swaziland and human rights organizations elsewhere  In 2005  the constitution was put into effect  though there is still much debate in the country about the constitutional reforms  From the early seventies  there was active resistance to the royal hegemony  However despite complaints from progressive formations  strong support for the monarchy and the current political system by the majority of the population is still there  This is due to the fact that submissions were made by citizens around the country to commissions including the constitutional draft committee that they would prefer to maintain the current situation  The Swazi bicameral Parliament or Libandla consists of the Senate  30 seats  10 members appointed by the House of Assembly and 20 appointed by the monarch  to serve five year terms  and the House of Assembly  65 seats  10 members appointed by the monarch and 55 elected by popular vote  to serve five year terms  elections  House of Assembly   last held 19 September 2008  next to be held in 2013  election results  House of Assembly   balloting is done on a non party basis  candidates for election are nominated by the local council of each constituency and for each constituency the three candidates with the most votes in the first round of voting are narrowed to a single winner by a second round   edit  Administrative divisions Main article  Districts of Swaziland Swaziland is divided into four districts

December 2010  Main article  Geography of Swaziland Swaziland lies across a geological fault which runs from the Drakensberg Mountains of Lesotho  north through the Eastern highlands of Zimbabwe  forms the Great Rift Valley of Kenya and  eventually  peters out in present day Turkey  Landscape in Swaziland A small  land locked Kingdom  Swaziland is bordered in the North  West and South by the Republic of South Africa and by Mozambique in the East  Although Swaziland has a land area of only 17 364 km2  roughly the size of Wales or the American State of New Jersey  it contains four separate geographical regions  These run from North to South and are determined by altitude  Swaziland is located at approximately 26 30 S  31 30 E  10  Swaziland also offers a wide variety of landscapes  from the mountains along the Mozambican border to savannas in the east and rain forest in the northwest  Several rivers flow through the country  such as the Great Usuthu River  Along the eastern border with Mozambique is the Lubombo  a mountain ridge  at an altitude of around 600 meters  The mountains are broken by the canyons of three rivers  the Ngwavuma  the Usutu and the Mbuluzi River  This is cattle ranching country  The western border of the country  with an average altitude of 1200 meters  lies on the edge of an escarpment  Between the mountains rivers rush through deep gorges making this a most scenic region  Mbabane  the capital  is located on the Highveld  The Middleveld  lying at an average 700 meters above sea level is the most densely populated region of Swaziland with a lower rainfall than the mountains  Manzini  the principal commercial and industrial city  is situated in the Middleveld  The Lowveld of Swaziland  at around 250 meters  is less populated than other areas and presents a typical African bush country of thorn trees and grasslands  Development of the region was inhibited  in early days  by the scourge of malaria   edit  Climate Topographic map of Swaziland Main article  Climate of Swaziland The seasons are the reverse of those in the Northern Hemisphere with December being mid summer and June mid winter  Generally speaking  rain falls mostly during the summer months  often in the form of thunderstorms  Winter is the dry season  Annual rainfall is highest on the Highveld in the West  between 1 000 and 2 000 mm  39 4 and 78 7 in  depending on the year  The further East  the less rain  with the Lowveld recording 500 to 900 mm  19 7 to 35 4 in  per annum  Variations in temperature are also related to the altitude of the different regions  The Highveld temperature is temperate and  seldom  uncomfortably hot while the Lowveld may record temperatures around 40  C  104  F  in summer  The average temperatures at Mbabane  according to seasons  Spring September   October 18  C  64 4  F  Summer November   March 20  C  68  F  Autumn April   May 17  C  62 6  F  Winter June   August 13  C  55 4  F   edit  Economy Main article  Economy of Swaziland Coins of Swaziland Swaziland s economy is diversified  with agriculture  forestry and mining accounting for about 13  of GDP  manufacturing  textiles and sugar related processing  representing 37  of GDP and services   with government services in the lead   constituting 50  of GDP  Title Deed Lands  TDLs   where the bulk of high value crops are grown  sugar  forestry  and citrus  are characterized by high levels of investment and irrigation  and high productivity  Nevertheless  the majority of the population   about 75  is employed in subsistence agriculture on Swazi Nation Land  SNL   which  in contrast  suffers from low productivity and investment  This dual nature of the Swazi economy  with high productivity in textile manufacturing and in the industrialized agricultural TDLs on the one hand  and declining productivity subsistence agriculture  on SNL  on the other  may well explain the country s overall low growth  high inequality and unemployment  Economic growth in Swaziland has lagged behind that of its neighbors  Real GDP growth since 2001 has averaged 2 8   nearly 2 percentage points lower than growth in other Southern African Customs Union  SACU  member countries  Low agricultural productivity in the SNLs  repeated droughts  the devastating effect of HIV AIDS and an overly large and inefficient government sector are likely contributing factors  Swaziland s public finances deteriorated in the late 1990s following sizable surpluses a decade earlier  A combination of declining revenues and increased spending led to significant budget deficits  The considerable spending did not lead to more growth and did not benefit the poor  Much of the increased spending has gone to current expenditures related to wages  transfers  and subsidies  The wage bill today constitutes over 15  of GDP and 55  of total public spending  these are some of the highest levels on the African continent  The recent rapid growth in SACU revenues has  however  reversed the fiscal situation  and a sizable surplus was recorded since 2006  SACU revenues today account for over 60  of total government revenues  On the positive side  the external debt burden has declined markedly over the last 20 years  and domestic debt is almost negligible  external debt as a percent of GDP was less than 20  in 2006  The Swazi economy is very closely linked to the South African economy  from which it receives over 90  of its imports and to which it sends about 70  of its exports  Swaziland s other key trading partners are the United States and the EU  from whom the country has received trade preferences for apparel exports  under the African Growth and Opportunity Act   AGOA   to the US  and for sugar  to the EU   Under these agreements  both apparel and sugar exports did well  with rapid growth and a strong inflow of foreign direct investment  Textile exports grew by over 200  between 2000 and 2005 and sugar exports increasing by more than 50  over the same period  The continued vibrancy of the export sector is threatened by the removal of trade preferences for textiles  the accession to similar preferences for East Asian countries  and the phasing out of preferential prices for sugar to the EU market  Swaziland will thus have to face the challenge of remaining competitive in a changing global environment  A crucial factor in addressing this challenge is the investment climate  The recently concluded Investment Climate Assessment provides some positive findings in this regard  namely that Swaziland firms are among the most productive in Sub Saharan Africa  although they are less productive than firms in the most productive middle income countries in other regions  They compare more favorably with firms from lower middle income countries  but are hampered by inadequate governance arrangements and infrastructure  Swaziland s currency is pegged to the South African rand  subsuming Swaziland s monetary policy to South Africa  Customs duties from the Southern African Customs Union  which may equal as much as 70  of government revenue this year  and worker remittances from South Africa substantially supplement domestically earned income  Swaziland is not poor enough to merit an IMF program  however  the country is struggling to reduce the size of the civil service and control costs at public enterprises  The government is trying to improve the atmosphere for foreign direct investment   edit  Health Swaziland is critically affected by the HIV and AIDS pandemic  which is now an existential threat to its society  As reported in the 2009 CIA World Factbook  Swaziland has the highest HIV infection rate in the world  26  of all adults  more in other reports  and also the lowest life expectancy at 32 years  which is 6 years lower than the next lowest average of Angola  From another perspective  the last available World Health Organization data in 2002 shows that 64  of all deaths in the country were caused by HIV AIDS  11  In 2009  an estimated 7 000 people died from AIDS related causes  12  from a total population of approximately 1 185 000  13  This translates into an estimated 0 6  of the population dying from AIDS every year  Chronic illnesses that are the most prolific causes of death in the developed world account only for a minute fraction of deaths in Swaziland  for example  heart disease  strokes  and cancer cause fewer than 5  of deaths in Swaziland in total  compared to 55  of all deaths yearly in the US  14  In 2004  Swaziland acknowledged for the first time that it suffered an AIDS crisis  with 38 8  of tested pregnant women infected with HIV  see AIDS in Africa   Prime Minister Themba Dlamini declared a humanitarian crisis due to the combined effect of drought  land degradation  increased poverty  and HIV AIDS  According to the 2011 UNAIDS Report  Swaziland is close to achieving universal access to HIV AIDS treatment  defined as 80  coverage or greater  Estimates of treatment coverage range from 70  to 80  of those infected  15  Life expectancy has fallen from 61 years in 2000 to 32 years in 2009  16 Tuberculosis is also a significant problem  with an 18  mortality rate  Many patients have a multi drug resistant strain  and 83  are co infected with HIV  17  Public expenditure was at 4  of the GDP of the country  whereas private expenditure was at 2 3   18  specify  There were 16 physicians per 100 000 persons in the early 2000s  18  specify  Infant mortality was at 69 per 1 000 in 2005  18  specify  with the WHO showing that 47  of all deaths under 5 are caused

Princess Sikhanyiso Dlamini at the Reed Dance festival in Swaziland in 2006 Traditional homes in Swaziland Main article  Culture of Swaziland See also  Music of Swaziland The principal Swazi social unit is the homestead  a traditional beehive hut thatched with dry grass  In a polygamous homestead  each wife has her own hut and yard surrounded by reed fences  There are three structures for sleeping  cooking  and storage  brewing beer   In larger homesteads there are also structures used as bachelors  quarters and guest accommodation  Central to the traditional homestead is the cattle byre  a circular area enclosed by large logs interspaced with branches  The cattle byre has ritual as well as practical significance as a store of wealth and symbol of prestige  It contains sealed grain pits  Facing the cattle byre is the great hut which is occupied by the mother of the headman  The headman is central to all homestead affairs and he is often polygamous  He leads through example and advises his wives on all social affairs of the home as well as seeing to the larger survival of the family  He also spends time socializing with the young boys  who are often his sons or close relatives  advising them on the expectations of growing up and manhood  The Sangoma is a traditional diviner chosen by the ancestors of that particular family  The training of the Sangoma is called  kwetfwasa   At the end of the training  a graduation ceremony takes place where all the local sangoma come together for feasting and dancing  The diviner is consulted for various reasons  such the cause of sickness or even death  His diagnosis is based on  kubhula   a process of communication  through trance  with the natural super powers  The Inyanga  a medical and pharmaceutical specialist in western terms  possesses the bone throwing skill   kushaya ematsambo   used to determine the cause of the sickness  The most important cultural event in Swaziland is the Incwala ceremony  It is held on the fourth day after the full moon nearest the longest day  December 21  Incwala is often translated in English as  first fruits ceremony   but the King s tasting of the new harvest is only one aspect among many in this long pageant  Incwala is best translated as  Kingship Ceremony    when there is no king  there is no Incwala  It is high treason for any other person to hold an Incwala  Every Swazi may take part in the public parts of the Incwala  The climax of the event is the fourth day of the Big Incwala  The key figures are the King  Queen Mother  royal wives and children  the royal governors  indunas   the chiefs  the regiments  and the  bemanti  or  water people   Swaziland s most well known cultural event is the annual Reed Dance  In the eight day ceremony  girls cut reeds and present them to the queen mother and then dance   There is no formal competition   It is done in late August or early September  Only childless  unmarried girls can take part  The aims of the ceremony are to preserve girls  chastity  provide tribute labour for the Queen mother  and to encourage solidarity by working together  The royal family appoints a commoner maiden to be  induna   captain  of the girls and she announces over the radio the dates of the ceremony  She will be an expert dancer and knowledgeable on royal protocol  One of the King s daughters will be her counterpart  Today s Reed Dance is not an ancient ceremony  but developed out of the old  umchwasho  custom  In  umchwasho   all young girls were placed in a female age regiment  If any girl fell pregnant outside of marriage  her family paid a fine of one cow to the local chief  After a number of years  when the girls had reached a marriageable age  they would perform labour service for the Queen Mother  ending with dancing and feasting  The country was under the chastity rite of  umchwasho  until 19 August 2005  Swaziland is also known for a strong presence in the handcrafts industry  The formalized handcraft businesses of Swaziland employ over 2 500 people  many of whom are women  per TechnoServe Swaziland Handcrafts Impact Study   February 2011   The products are unique and reflect the culture of Swaziland  ranging from housewares  to artistic decorations  to complex glass  stone  or wood artwork   edit  Education Main article  Education in Swaziland Education in Swaziland is now free at primary level mainly 1st and 2nd grades and also free for orphaned and vulnerable children but not compulsory  19  In 1996  the net primary school enrollment rate was 90 8   with gender parity at the primary level  19  In 1998  80 5  of children reached grade five  19  The University of Swaziland provides higher education  The Swaziland National Library Service operates public community libraries throughout Swaziland and establishes school libraries in partnership with Fundza  a non governmental organization and the African Library Project  20   edit  Demographics Swazi people dancing in a cultural village show  Main article  Demographics of Swaziland The majority of Swaziland s population is ethnically Swazi  mixed with a small number of Zulu and White Africans  mostly people of British and Afrikaner descent  Traditionally Swazi have been subsistence farmers and herders  but most now mix such activities with work in the growing urban formal economy and in government  Some Swazi work in the mines in South Africa  Swaziland also received Portuguese settlers and African refugees from Mozambique  Christianity in Swaziland is sometimes mixed with traditional beliefs and practices  Many traditionalists believe that most Swazi ascribe a special spiritual role to the monarch  Residents of Swaziland have the lowest documented life expectancy in the world at 31 88 years  less than half the world average of 69 4  21   edit  Languages SiSwati 22   also known as Swati  Swazi or Seswati  is a Bantu language of the Nguni Group  spoken in Swaziland and South Africa  It has
