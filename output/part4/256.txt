Lantern is the name of multiple superheroes from the DC Universe  all of whom are characterized by a power ring and the ability to construct solid constructs with the ring  The first Green Lantern  Alan Scott  was created by writer Bill Finger and artist Martin Nodell in All American Comics  16  July 1940   1  Each Green Lantern possesses a power ring and power lantern that gives the user great control over the physical world as long as the wielder has sufficient willpower and strength to wield it  The ring is one of the most powerful weapons in the universe and can be very dangerous  While the ring of the Golden Age Green Lantern  Alan Scott  is magically powered  the rings worn by all subsequent Lanterns are technological creations of the Guardians of the Universe  who granted such rings to worthy candidates  This shift to a technological explanation reflects the comic book industry s tendency to explain extraordinary powers through science and reasoning rather than magic

publishing new adventures of Alan Scott as the Green Lantern  In 1959  at the beginning of the Silver Age of Comic Books  DC editor Julius Schwartz assigned writer John Broome and artist Gil Kane to revive the Green Lantern character  this time as test pilot Hal Jordan who became a founding member of the Justice League of America  In 1970  writer Denny O Neil and artist Neal Adams teamed Green Lantern with archer Green Arrow in groundbreaking  socially conscious  and award winning stories that pitted the sensibilities of the law and order oriented Green Lantern with the populist Green Arrow  Several cosmically themed series followed  as did occasional different individuals in the role of Earth s Green Lantern  Most prominent of these are Hal Jordan  John Stewart  Guy Gardner  and Kyle Rayner  Each of the Earth s Green Lanterns has been a member of either the Justice Society of America or the Justice League of America  and John Stewart was featured as one of the main characters in both the Justice League and the Justice League Unlimited animated series  The Green Lanterns are often depicted as being close friends of the various men who have been the Flash  the most notable

 using the name Mart Dellon  and Bill Finger  He first appeared in the Golden Age of comic books in All American Comics  16  July 1940   published by All American Publications  one of three companies that would eventually merge to form DC Comics  This Green Lantern s real name was Alan Scott  a railroad engineer who  after a railway crash  came into possession of a magic lantern which spoke to him and said it would bring power  From this  he crafted a magic ring which gave him a wide variety of powers  The limitations of the ring were that it had to be  charged  every 24 hours by touching it to the lantern for a time  and that it did not work on objects made of wood  Nodell had originally planned to give the Green Lantern the alter ego  Alan Ladd   this being a linguistic twist on Aladdin  who had a magic lamp and magic ring of his own  DC considered the wordplay distracting and foolish  and the character s name was changed before publication to  Alan Scott   In May 1942  the film This Gun for Hire suddenly made the journeyman actor Alan Ladd a movie star  Nodell would always joke that they had missed a great opportunity  2  The Green Lantern was a popular character in the 1940s  featured in both All American Comics and in his own title and co starring in Comic Cavalcade along with Flash and Wonder Woman  He was a charter member of the Justice Society of America  whose adventures ran in All Star Comics  After World War II  the popularity of superheroes declined  The Green Lantern comic book was cancelled with issue  38  May June 1949   All Star Comics  57  1951  was the character s last Golden Age appearance   edit  Silver Age revival Cover to Showcase 22  October 1959   the first appearance of Hal Jordan  Following the successful revival of the Flash in Showcase  4  Oct  1956   a new Green Lantern was introduced in Showcase  22  September October 1959   This Green Lantern was Hal Jordan  a test pilot who was given a power ring by a dying alien  Abin Sur  and who became a member of the Green Lantern Corps  an interstellar organization of police overseen by the Guardians of the Universe  The Corps  rings were powerless against anything colored yellow  due to a yellow colored  dopant  in the master power generator located on Oa  where the Guardians maintained their headquarters  without which dopant the master generator would not function as such  Jordan s creation was motivated by a desire to make him more of a science fiction hero  editor Julius Schwartz having been a longtime fan of that genre and literary agent who saw pop culture tastes turning in that direction  Despite multiple characters taking on the role of Green Lantern for Earth  Jordan remains the most well known in both comics and media   edit  Later developments With issue  76  April 1970   the series made a radical stylistic departure  Editor Schwartz  in one of the company s earliest efforts to provide more than fantasy  worked with the writer artist team of Denny O Neil and Neal Adams to spark new interest in the comic and address a perceived need for social relevance  They added the character Green Arrow  with the cover though not the official name retitled Green Lantern Co Starring Green Arrow  and had the pair travel through America encountering  real world  issues  to which they reacted in different ways   Green Lantern as fundamentally a lawman  Green Arrow as a liberal iconoclast  Additionally during this run  the groundbreaking  Snowbirds Don t Fly  story was published  issues  85 and  86  in which Green Arrow s teen sidekick Speedy  the later grownup hero Red Arrow  developed a heroin addiction that he was forcibly made to quit  The stories were critically acclaimed  with publications such as The New York Times  The Wall Street Journal  and Newsweek citing it as an example of how comic books were  growing up   3  However  the O Neil Adams run was not a commercial success  and after only 14 issues  the two left the title  which was cancelled  The title would know a number of revivals and cancellations  Its title would change to Green Lantern Corps at one point as the popularity rose and waned  During a time there were two regular titles  each with a Green Lantern  and a third member in the Justice League  A new character  Kyle Rayner  was created to become the feature while Hal Jordan first became the villain Parallax  then died and came back as the Spectre  In the wake of The New Frontier  writer Geoff Johns returned Hal Jordan as Green Lantern in Green Lantern  Rebirth  2004 05   Johns began to lay groundwork for  Blackest Night   released July 13  2010 4    viewing it as the third part of the trilogy started by Rebirth  Expanding on the Green Lantern mythology in the second part   Sinestro Corps War   2007   Johns  with artist Ethan van Sciver  found wide critical acclaim and commercial success with the series  which promised the introduction of a spectrum of colored  lanterns   Currently  all four  current  Green Lanterns have stories being told in simultaneously published series  Green Lantern  primarily Jordan   Green Lantern Corps  primarily Rayner and Stewart   and Green Lantern  Emerald Warriors  primarily Gardner    edit  Relaunch DC Comics relaunched Green Lantern with issue  1 in September 2011 as part of the company wide relaunch  This new series stars both Jordan and Sinestro as Green Lanterns  It is written by Geoff Johns and drawn by artists Doug Mahnke and Christian Alamy  5  6  As part of the relaunch  all four  current  Green Lanterns have stories

Golden Age Green Lantern  edit  Alan Scott Main article  Alan Scott Alan Scott s Green Lantern history originally began thousands of years ago when a mystical  green flame  meteor fell to Earth in ancient China  The voice of the flame prophesied that it would act three times  once to bring death  a lamp maker crafted the green metal of the meteor into a lamp  in fear and as punishment for what they thought sacrilege  the local villagers killed him  only to be destroyed by a sudden burst of the green flame   once to bring life  in modern times  the lamp came into the hands of a patient in a mental institution who fashioned the lamp into a modern lantern  the green flame restored him to sanity and gave him a new life   and once to bring power  By 1940  the lantern passed into the possession of Alan Scott  a young engineer  Following a railroad bridge collapse of which he was the only survivor  the flame instructed Scott how to fashion a ring from its metal  to give him fantastic powers as the superhero Green Lantern  He adopted a colorful costume and became a crime fighter  Alan was a founding member of the Justice Society of America  After the Crisis on Infinite Earths  although the original origin story was still in continuity   a later Tales of the Green Lantern Corps story was published that brought Scott even closer to the Corps  ranks  when it was revealed that Alan Scott was predated as Earth s Green Lantern by a Green Lantern named Yalan Gur  a resident of China  Not only had the Corps  now familiar green  black and white uniform motif not yet been adopted  but Yalan Gur altered the basic red uniform to more closely resemble the style of clothing worn by his countrymen  Power ultimately corrupted this early Green Lantern  as he attempted to rule over mankind  which forced the Guardians to cause his ring to manifest a weakness to wood  the material from which most Earth weapons of the time were fashioned  This allowed the Chinese peasants to ultimately defeat their corrupted  champion   His ring and lantern were burned and it was during this process that the  intelligence  inhabiting the ring and the lantern  and linking them to the Guardians  was damaged  Over time  when it had occasion to manifest itself  this  intelligence  became known as the mystical  Starheart  of fable  Centuries later  it was explained  when Scott found the mystical lantern  it had no memory of its true origins  save a vague recollection of the uniform of its last master  This was the origin of Scott s distinctive costume  Due to its damaged link to them  the Guardians presumed the ring and lantern to be lost in whatever cataclysm overcame their last owner of record  Thus Scott was never noticed by the Guardians and went on to carve a history of his own apart from that of the Corps  sporting a ring with an artificially induced weakness against anything made of wood  Honoring this separate history  the Guardians never moved to force Scott to relinquish the ring  formally join the Corps  or adopt its colors  Some sort of link between Scott and the Corps  however  was hinted at in a Silver Age cross over story which depicts Scott and Hal Jordan charging their rings at the same Power Battery while both reciting the  Brightest Day  oath  During the Rann Thanagar War  it was revealed that Scott is an honorary member of the Corps   edit  Silver Age Green Lantern  edit  Hal Jordan Main article  Hal Jordan The second Green Lantern to see publication is also the most notable  The character of Harold  Hal  Jordan was a second generation test pilot  having followed in the footsteps of his father  Martin Jordan  He was given the power ring and battery  lantern  by a dying alien named Abin Sur  whose spaceship crashed on Earth  Abin Sur used his ring to seek out an individual who was  utterly honest and born without fear  to take his place as a member of the corps  At one point  when Hal Jordan was incapacitated  it was revealed that there were two individuals matching the specified criteria on Earth  the other being Guy Gardner  and the ring chose Jordan solely because of his proximity to Abin Sur  Gardner then became listed as Hal s  backup   in case there was an instance in which Jordan was unavailable or otherwise incapacitated  Later  when Gardner was put into a coma  it turned out that by then there was a third human suitable for the task  John Stewart  who was designated as the Earth Sector s  backup  Lantern  Jordan  as Green Lantern  became a founding member of the Justice League of America and as of the mid 2000s is  along with John Stewart  one of the two active duty Lanterns in Earth s sector of space  Jordan also automatically became a member of the Green Lantern Corps  an intergalactic  police  force which bears some similarities to the  Lensmen  from the science fiction series written by E E  Smith  although both creators Julius Schwartz and John Broome denied ever reading Smith s stories  14  Nevertheless  the early 1980s miniseries  Green Lantern Corps  honors the similarity with two characters in the corps  Eddore of Tront and Arisia  A different interpretation of Jordan and the Corps appears in Superman  Red Son  Following the rebirth of Superman and the destruction of Green Lantern s hometown of Coast City in the early 1990s  Hal Jordan seemingly went insane and destroyed the Green Lantern Corps and the Central Power Battery  Now calling himself Parallax  Hal Jordan would devastate the DC Universe off and on for the next several years  However  after Earth s sun was threatened by a Sun Eater  Jordan sacrificed his life  expending the last of his vast power to reignite the dying star  Jordan subsequently returned from beyond the grave as the Spectre  the divine Spirit of God s Vengeance  whom Jordan attempted to transform into a Spirit of Redemption  which ended in failure  In Green Lantern  Rebirth  it is revealed that Jordan was under the influence of a creature known as Parallax when he turned renegade  Parallax was a creature of pure fear that had been imprisoned in the Central Power Battery by the Guardians of the Universe in the distant past  Imprisonment had rendered the creature dormant and it was eventually forgotten  becoming known merely as the  yellow impurity  in the power rings  Sinestro was able to wake Parallax and encourage it to seek out Hal Jordan as a host  Although Parallax had been trying to corrupt Jordan  via his ring  for some time  it was not until after the destruction of Coast City that it was able to succeed  It took advantage of Jordan s weakened emotional state to lure him to Oa and cause him to attack anyone who stood in his way  After killing several Green Lanterns  Jordan finally entered the Central Power Battery and absorbed all the power  unwittingly freeing the Parallax entity and allowed it to graft onto his soul  The Spectre bonded with Jordan in the hopes of freeing the former Green Lantern s soul from Parallax s taint  but was not strong enough to do so  In Green Lantern  Rebirth  Parallax began to assert control of the Parallax Spectre Jordan composite  Thanks to a supreme effort of will  Jordan was able to free himself from Parallax  rejoin his soul to his body and reclaim his power ring  The newly revived  and rejuvenated  Jordan awoke just in time to save Kyle Rayner and Green Arrow from Sinestro  After the Korugarian s defeat  Jordan was able to successfully lead his fellow Green Lanterns in battle against Parallax and with help from Guardians Sayd and Ganthet  imprisoned it within the personal power batteries of Earth s Lanterns  rendering the Green Lantern s rings free of the yellow impurity  provided they had the power of will to do so  Hal Jordan is once again a member of both the Justice League and the Green Lantern Corps  and along with John Stewart is one of the two Corps members assigned to Sector 2814  personally defeating Sinestro in the Sinestro Corps War  Jordan is designated as Green Lantern 2814 1  Post  Sinestro Corps War   DC Comics revisited the origin of Hal Jordan as a precursor to  The Blackest Night  storyline  the next chapter in the Geoff Johns era on Green Lantern  Hal Jordan is the Green Lantern portrayed by Ryan Reynolds in the 2011 Green Lantern film   edit  Bronze Age Green Lanterns  edit  Guy Gardner Main article  Guy Gardner  comics  In the late 1960s  Guy Gardner appeared as the second choice to replace Abin Sur as Green Lantern of sector 2814  Gardner was originally supposed to receive Abin Sur s ring  but Jordan was closer  This placed him as the  backup  Green Lantern for Jordan  But early in his career as a Green Lantern  tragedy struck Gardner as a power battery blew up in his face  putting him in a coma for years  During the Crisis on Infinite Earths  the Guardians split into factions  one of which appointed a newly revived Gardner as their champion  As a result of his years in a coma  Guy was very emotionally unstable  although he still mostly managed to fight valiantly  He has gone through many changes  including wielding Sinestro s yellow Guardian power ring  then gaining and losing Vuldarian powers  and readmission to the Corps during Green Lantern  Rebirth  He later became part of the Green Lantern Honor Guard  and oversees the training of new Green Lanterns  Gardner is designated as Honor Guard Green Lantern  Guy Gardner helped lead the defense of Oa during the events of  Blackest Night   In Green Lantern Corps  43  Guy succumbs to his rage due to the temporary death of Kyle Rayner and becomes a Red Lantern   edit  John Stewart Main article  John Stewart  comics  In the early 1970s  John Stewart  an architect  was selected by the Guardians to replace a comatose Guy Gardner as the backup Green Lantern for Jordan  When Jordan resigned from the Corps for an extended period of time  Stewart served as the regular Lantern for that period  Since then  Stewart was in and out of action due to various circumstances  even becoming the first mortal Guardian of the Universe  He also joined and led the Darkstars when the Green Lantern Corps were destroyed by Parallax  After that  he took over being Green Lantern for Kyle Rayner when he left Earth  also taking his place in the JLA  Now he has begun serving with Jordan as one of his sector s two designated regular duty Lanterns  designated as Green Lantern 2814 2   edit  Modern Age Green Lantern  edit  Kyle Rayner Main article  Kyle Rayner Kyle Rayner is a struggling freelance artist when he is approached by the last Guardian of the Universe  Ganthet  to become a new Green Lantern with the last power ring  Ganthet s reasons for choosing Rayner remained a secret for quite some time  Despite not being cut from the same cloth of bravery and fearlessness as Hal Jordan   or perhaps because of that   Rayner proved to be popular with readers and his fellow characters  Having continually proven himself on his own and with the JLA  he became known amongst the Oans as The Torch Bearer  He briefly operated as Ion after using the power of the entire Green Lantern Corps  He was responsible for the rebirth of the Guardians and the re ignition of the Central Power Battery  essentially restoring all that Jordan had destroyed as Parallax  Kyle Rayner was chosen to wield the last ring because he knew fear  and Parallax had been released from the Central Power Battery  Ganthet knew this and chose Kyle because his experiences dealing with fear enabled him to resist Parallax  Because Parallax is a manifestation of fear  and yellow  none of the other Green Lanterns  including Hal  could harm Parallax and  therefore  came under his control  Kyle taught them to feel and overcome fear so they could defeat Parallax and incarcerate him in the Central Power Battery once again  Kyle became Ion  who is later revealed to be the manifestation of willpower in the same way Parallax is fear  During the Sinestro Corps War between the Green Lantern Corps and the Sinestro Corps  Ion was imprisoned while Parallax possesses Kyle  In Green Lantern  vol  4   24  Parallax consumes Hal Jordan  Hal Jordan enters into Kyle s prison  and with his help  Kyle finally escapes Parallax  Afterward  Ganthet and Sayd trap Parallax in the Lanterns of the four Green Lanterns of Earth  Ganthet asks Kyle to give up his right to be Ion and become a Green Lantern again  Kyle accepts  and Ganthet gives Kyle a power ring  Kyle is outfitted with a new costume including a mask that looks like the one from his first uniform  Kyle is now a member of the Green Lantern Corps Honor Guard  and has been partnered with Guy Gardner  Kyle now shows up mostly as part of the ensemble cast of Green Lantern Corps  Corps rookie Sodam Yat took over the mantle of Ion  Sodam has made an appearance in the Legion of Super Heroes Final Crisis tie in Legion of Three Worlds as the last surviving Green Lantern Guardian of the Universe  Kyle is designated as Green Lantern 2814 4 within the Corps  citation needed  Kyle Rayner died in Green Lantern Corps  42  Jan  2010  after sacrificing himself to save Oa from an attack by the Black Lantern Corps  The following issue  Kyle is brought back to life by the power of a Star Sapphire who connects Soranik Natu s heart to his heart   edit  Others who have headlined as Green Lantern  edit  Jade Main article  Jade  comics  The daughter of Alan Scott  Jennifer Lynn Hayden would discover she shared her father s mystical connection to the Starheart  which gave her the abilities of a Green Lantern  Choosing to follow in her father s footsteps  she became the superheroine Jade  She would later fight a manifestation of the Starheart and lose those abilities  After Jade was stripped of her powers  Kyle Rayner gave her a copy of Hal Jordan s power ring  When Rayner left Earth to restart the Green Lantern Corps  Jade donned the classic Green Lantern uniform and served as the planet s Green Lantern until losing the ring during a battle with the villain Fatality  Later  when the ring was returned to her  she changed her Green Lantern uniform to a modified version of Rayner s  Jade continued to function as a Green Lantern until Rayner  as Ion  used his power to restore her connection to the Starheart  During Infinite Crisis  she died while trying to stop Alexander Luthor  Jr  from destroying the universe to create a new multiverse  Upon her death  Jade returned her Starheart power to Rayner  In the Blackest Night event  her remains have been reanimated as one of the Black Lantern Corps after receiving a black power ring  She was resurrected by Hal Jordan while he was bonded with the White Entity along with eleven other Black Lantern Corps members   edit  Thaal Sinestro Sinestro receives a power ring after Mogo s death at the end of the 2011 event  War of the Green Lanterns   In the New 52 he gives Hal Jordan a ring that he creates   edit  Powers and abilities Main article  Power ring  DC Comics  Each Green Lantern wields a power ring that can generate a variety of effects  sustained purely by the ring wearer s imagination and strength of will  The greater the user s willpower  the more effective the ring  The upper limits of the power ring s abilities remain undefined  and it has been referred to as  the most powerful weapon in the universe  on more than one occasion  The Weaponers of Qward say that every weapon has a weakness and the weakness of a green lantern power ring is its wearer  though some argue that this is its strength   Across the years  the rings have been shown capable of accomplishing almost anything within the imagination of the ring bearer  Stories in 2006 retconned the ring s long established ineffectiveness on yellow objects  stating that the ring wielder need only feel fear  understand it and overcome it in order to affect yellow objects  however  it is a learned and practiced ability  making it a weakness to some Green Lanterns   giving retroactive credence to the explanation of the ring s real but surmountable weakness to yellow  Power rings as used by various wielders have exhibited  but are not limited to  the following effects  Constructs of green  solid energy   which can vary from microscopic to tremendous in size and or complexity and are limited by the imagination of the ring s wielder  This can be used to attack  defend  or to grab targets  Pre Crisis  the rings generated telekinetic skills without constructs  if needed   Force field generation  a somewhat protective aura  limited by user s willpower  used to shield the wearer from the rigors of the vacuum of space  This provides a breathable atmosphere for the user as well  Contrary to older canon  a Green Lantern ring currently does not automatically protect its wearer from harm but must be willed to do so  previously  an unconscious wielder generated a protective force field automatically   Generation of mental  earplugs  to block out telepathic communication and manipulation  15  Rendering targets invisible  16  Lights and beams of various intensity and colors  such as destructive plasma and harmless multicolored lights  Movement capabilities  Flight  including flight at speeds beyond that of light  although this creates an enormous expenditure of energy  Relatively instantaneous transport across the galaxy and other distances through generated wormholes Teleportation  an ability that has not been used in quite some time and is outside the ability of modern Green Lanterns  In modern stories  only the Indigo Rings allow instantaneous teleportation  Pre Crisis  the rings allowed for travel faster than the speed of light  Time travel  though several power rings are needed to complete this  The rings can act as semi sentient computers and access information through their connection with the Book of Oa  the rings have problem solving skills but they cannot make decisions or take actions on their own  and must be given directives by the wearer  Translation of nearly all languages  originally  this was accomplished by using willpower  but this has changed in the modern era to be a function of the rings themselves   Communication between ringwielders  regardless of distance apart Diagnostic capabilities  allowing the user to see in X Ray  diagnose illnesses  and identify materials  Mental powers of various stages  Telepathy Hypnosis  including projecting the target s thoughts onto constructed maps Creation and emission of certain types of radiation  including simulated wavelengths  such as kryptonite Placing humans into a state of suspended animation  17  and pulling them out of it Changing the state of targeted matter and the wearer  Allowing targets and the wearer to phase through solid objects Rendering the wearer and targets invisible Accelerated healing of wounds  protection and treatment from viruses and biological attacks and certain surgical procedures including reattachment of severed limbs and digits  More advanced medical procedures may be performed manually and are limited by the wearer s knowledge of medicine  Lanterns can still do this via constructs of objects with that capability  although Pre Crisis  a wearer could instantaneously reinvigorate limbs that had not been used in years  so someone bedridden for years could walk as though their muscles had not atrophied  Virtual shape shifting by generating a hard light holographic disguise around the ring bearer   Digitizing  the wearer to absorb them into the ring where they can live in a wearer generated  world  of their own nearly indefinitely  Pre Crisis  a ring could alter a target or wearer s molecular size  including shrinking to an atomic level or growing to galactic sizes   evolutionary stage  such as turning a target human into an ape   or distort specific areas or the entirety of the body  such as slowing the Flash down by making his upper torso too large for him to run  or causing Arisia to age when when she wanted to be older subconsciously   Pre Crisis  a wearer could animate non living matter and make the target do whatever he willed  Pre Crisis  the rings could create a construct of a ring that a  non Lantern  could use for 4 hours at a time  as opposed to 24  without a great effort of will  In the modern era  Guardians can simply create duplicate rings at will  Pre Crisis  a ring could create multiple copies of its wearer if certain conditions were met  each copy had the capabilities of the original wearer  Pre Crisis  rings could extract information from corpses  An example of this is shown in Green Lantern  First Flight Sinestro was able to  reconnect synapses  in the brain of a dead criminal in order to extract information via a kind of guided discussion   edit  Green Lantern oath Green Lantern is famous for the oath he recites when he charges his ring  Originally  the oath was simple       and I shall shed my light over dark evil  For the dark things cannot stand the light  The light of the Green Lantern     Alan Scott This oath is also used by Lanterns Tomar Re of sector 2813  and Chief Administrator Salaak  18  In the mid 1940s  this was revised into the form that became famous during the Hal Jordan era    In brightest day  in blackest night  No evil shall escape my sight Let those who worship evil s might  Beware my power  Green Lantern s light       Hal Jordan Many Current Lanterns The oath in this form is thought to be the creation of Alfred Bester  who wrote many Green Lantern stories in the 1940s  although his version used  darkest  in the first line  the change to  blackest  came a few years later  probably by Henry Kuttner  19  Each Green Lantern has his own oath  however some are more common than others  They are usually four lines long with a rhyme scheme of  AAAA  or  AABB   The Pre Crisis version of Hal Jordan created the oath when he had three early adventures that inspired him on how he can defeat any attempt to elude him  he captured robbers who used a magnesium bomb to blind everyone in an area by using his ring as a radar to find them  he tracked criminals in a dark cave by using his ring to make them glow with phosphorescence  finally  Jordan tracked down safecrackers by detecting the faint shockwaves from the explosives used by the criminals and tracing it back  It had been established in the past that many Green Lanterns have their own oath  For example  Medphyll  the Green Lantern of the planet J586  seen in Swamp Thing  61   All Flesh is Grass    a planet where a sentient plant species lives  has the following oath  In forest dark or glade beferned No blade of grass shall go unturned Let those who have the daylight spurned Tread not where this green lamp has burned  Other notable oaths include that of Jack T  Chance  You who are wicked  evil and mean I m the nastiest creep you ve ever seen  Come one  come all  put up a fight I ll pound your asses with Green Lantern s light  Yowza  and that of Rot Lop Fan  a Green Lantern whose species lacks sight  and thus has no concepts of brightness  darkness  day  night  color  or lanterns  In loudest din or hush profound My ears catch evil s slightest sound Let those who toll out evil s knell Beware my power  the F Sharp Bell  Since Green Lantern  Rebirth and the restart of the Green Lantern Corps  the only oath used has been the Brightest Day  Blackest Night version  In Green Lantern  vol  4   27  the Alpha Lanterns are revealed to have their own oath  In days of peace  in nights of war Obey the Laws forever more Misconduct must be answered for  Swear us the chosen  The Alpha Corps  In Legion of 3 Worlds  Sodam Yat in the 31st century   as the last of the Green Lanterns and the last of the Guardians   recited a new oath  In brightest day  through Blackest Night  No other Corps shall spread its light  Let those who try to stop what s right  Burn like my power  Green Lantern s Light  In the animated TV series Duck Dodgers  Duck Dodgers temporarily becomes a Green Lantern after accidentally picking up Hal Jordan s laundry  In the first part of the episode  he forgets the real quote and makes up his own version  In blackest day or brightest night Watermelon  cantaloupe  yadda yadda Erm    superstitious and cowardly lot With liberty and justice for all  In 2011  around the release of the Green Lantern movie  a trailer for The Muppets featured Kermit reciting a parody of the oath  20  In brightest day  in darkest night No evil shall escape my sight  Let those who laugh at my lack of height Beware my banjo   Green Froggy s light  Also on the tv show  Mad  TV Series  they had a movie parody calles Rioa  a fusion of Green Lantern
