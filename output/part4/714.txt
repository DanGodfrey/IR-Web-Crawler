Broadcasting Company Official website NBC com The National Broadcasting Company  NBC  is an American commercial broadcasting television network and former radio network headquartered in the GE Building in New York City s Rockefeller Center with additional major offices near Los Angeles and in Chicago  NBC is sometimes referred to as the  Peacock Network   due to its stylized peacock logo  created originally for color broadcasts  Formed in 1926 by the Radio Corporation of America  RCA   NBC was the first major broadcast network in the United States  In 1986  control of NBC passed to General Electric  GE   with GE s  6 4 billion purchase of RCA  GE had previously owned RCA and NBC until 1930  when it had been forced to sell the company as a result of antitrust charges  After the 1986 acquisition  the chief executive of NBC was Bob Wright  until he retired  giving his job to Jeff Zucker  The network is currently part of the media company NBCUniversal  a joint venture of Comcast and General Electric  As a result of the merger  Zucker left NBC and was replaced by Comcast executive Steve Burke  NBC has 10 owned and operated stations and nearly 200 affiliates in the

History NBC Headquarters in New York City  edit  Radio  edit  Earliest stations  WEAF and WJZ During a period of early broadcast business consolidation  the radio making Radio Corporation of America  RCA  had acquired New York radio station WEAF from American Telephone  amp  Telegraph  AT amp T   An RCA shareholder  Westinghouse  had a competing facility in Newark  New Jersey pioneer station WJZ  no relation to the radio and TV stations in Baltimore currently using those call letters   which also served as the flagship for a loosely structured network  This station was transferred from Westinghouse to RCA in 1923  and moved to New York  3  WEAF acted as a laboratory for AT amp T s manufacturing and supply outlet Western Electric  whose products included transmitters and antennas  The Bell System  AT amp T s telephone utility  was developing technologies to transmit voice  and music grade audio over short and long distances  using both wireless and wired methods  The 1922 creation of WEAF offered a research and development center for those activities  WEAF had a regular schedule of radio programs  including some of the first commercially sponsored programs  and was an immediate success  In an early example of chain or networking broadcasting  the station linked with the Outlet Company s WJAR in Providence  Rhode Island  and with AT amp T s station in Washington  D C   WCAP  New parent RCA saw an advantage in sharing programming  and after getting a license for station WRC in Washington  D C   in 1923  attempted to transmit audio between cities via low quality telegraph lines  AT amp T refused outside companies access to its high quality phone lines  The early effort fared poorly  since the uninsulated telegraph lines were susceptible to atmospheric and other electrical interference  In 1925  AT amp T decided WEAF and its embryonic network were incompatible with AT amp T s primary goal of providing a telephone service  AT amp T offered to sell the station to RCA in a deal that included the right to lease AT amp T s phone lines for network transmission   edit  Red and Blue Networks RCA spent  1 million to buy WEAF and Washington sister station WCAP  shut down the latter station and merged its facilities with surviving station WRC  and announced in late 1926 the creation of a new division known as The National Broadcasting Company  4  The new division was divided in ownership among RCA  fifty percent   General Electric  thirty percent   and Westinghouse  twenty percent   NBC launched officially on November 15  1926  WEAF and WJZ  the flagships of the two earlier networks  operated side by side for about a year as part of the new NBC  On January 1  1927 NBC formally divided their respective marketing strategies  the Red Network offered commercially sponsored entertainment and music programming  the Blue Network mostly carried sustaining or non sponsored broadcasts  especially news and cultural programs  Various histories of NBC suggest the color designations for the two networks came from the color of the push pins NBC engineers used to designate affiliates of WEAF  red  and WJZ  blue   or from the use of double ended red and blue colored pencils  A similar two part two color strategy appeared in the recording industry  dividing the market between classical and popular offerings  Radio City West was located at Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street in Los Angeles until it was replaced by a bank in the mid 1960s  On April 5  1927  NBC reached the West Coast with the launch of the NBC Orange Network  also known as The Pacific Coast Network  This was followed by the debut on October 18  1931  of the NBC Gold Network  also known as The Pacific Gold Network  The Orange Network carried Red Network programming and the Gold Network carried programming from the Blue Network  Initially the Orange Network recreated Eastern Red Network programming for West Coast stations at KPO in San Francisco  In 1936 the Orange Network name was dropped and network affiliate stations became part of the Red Network  At the same time the Gold Network became part of the Blue Network  NBC also developed a network for shortwave radio stations in the 1930s called the NBC White Network  Prior to occupying its location at Rockefeller Center  NBC had occupied upper floors of a building at 711 Fifth Avenue developed by Floyd Brown  himself an architect  5  Home of NBC from its construction in 1927  5  the broadcast company occupied floor designed by Raymond Hood   who designed the tenants multiple studios as  a Gothic church  the Roman forum  a Louis XIV room and  in a space devoted to jazz  something  wildly futuristic  with plenty of color in bizarre designs   5  NBC outgrew 711 Fifth Avenue in 1933  5  In 1930  General Electric was compelled by antitrust charges to divest itself of RCA  which it had founded  RCA moved its corporate headquarters into the new Rockefeller Center in 1933  signing the leases in 1931  RCA was the lead tenant at 30 Rockefeller Plaza  the RCA Building  now the GE Building   The building housed NBC studios  as well as theaters for RCA owned RKO Pictures  Rockefeller Center s founder and financier John D  Rockefeller  Jr   arranged the deal with the chairman of GE  Owen D  Young  and the president of RCA  David Sarnoff  6   edit  Chimes Main article  NBC chimes GE Building entrance The famous three note NBC chimes came about after several years of development  The three note sequence G E  C  were heard first over Atlanta s WSB  7  The chimes outline what is known to musicians as a second inversion C Major triad  Someone at NBC in New York heard the WSB version of the notes during the networked broadcast of a Georgia Tech football game and asked permission to use it on the national network  NBC started to use the three notes in 1931  and it was the first audio trademark to be accepted by the U S  Patent and Trademark Office  8  9  A variant sequence was also used that went G E  C  G  known as  the fourth chime  and used during wartime  especially in the wake of the attack on Pearl Harbor   on D Day  and disasters  The NBC chimes were mechanized in 1932 by Richard H  Ranger of the Rangertone company  their purpose was to send a low level signal of constant amplitude that would be heard by the various switching stations manned by NBC and AT amp T engineers  and thus used as a system cue for switching different stations between the Red and Blue network feeds  Contrary to popular legend  the three musical notes  G E  C   did not originally stand for NBC s previous parent corporation  the General Electric Company  although GE s radio station in Schenectady  New York  WGY  was an early NBC affiliate  and GE was an early shareholder in NBC s founding parent RCA  General Electric did not own NBC outright until 1986  G E  C  was incorporated into John Williams  theme music for the NBC Nightly News  and is still used on NBC TV  A variant with two preceding notes is used on the MSNBC cable television network  NBC s radio branch no longer exists   edit  New beginnings  The Blue Network becomes ABC The Federal Communications Commission  FCC  had  since its creation in 1934  investigated the monopolistic effects of network broadcasting  The FCC found that NBC s two networks and its owned and operated stations dominated audiences  affiliates and advertising in American radio  In 1939 the FCC ordered RCA to divest itself of one of the two networks  RCA fought the divestiture order  but in 1940 divided NBC into two companies in case an appeal was lost  The Blue Network became NBC Blue Network  Inc  and NBC Red became NBC Red Network  Inc  Both networks formally divorced operations on January 8  1942  10  and the Blue Network was referred to on the air as either Blue or Blue Network  with official corporate name Blue Network Company  Inc  NBC Red  on the air  became known simply as NBC  After losing its final appeal before the U S  Supreme Court in May 1943  RCA sold Blue Network Company  Inc   for  8 million to Life Savers magnate Edward J  Noble  completing the sale on October 12  1943  11  Noble got the network name  leases on land lines and the New York studios  two and a half stations  WJZ in Newark New York  KGO in San Francisco  and WENR in Chicago  which shared a frequency with Prairie Farmer station WLS   and about 60 affiliates  Noble wanted a better name for the network and in 1944 acquired the rights to the name American Broadcasting Company from George Storer  The Blue Network became ABC officially on June 15  1945  after the sale was completed  Further information  Blue Network NBC Tower in Chicago  edit  Defining radio s golden age Main article  NBC Radio Network The front entrance of the NBC Tower at 454 N  Columbus Drive  Chicago  IL  In the golden days of network broadcasting  1930 to 1950  NBC was at the pinnacle of American radio  NBC broadcast radio s earliest mass hit  Amos  n  Andy  beginning in 1926 27 in its original fifteen minute serial format  The show set a standard for nearly all serialized programming in the original radio era  both comedies and soap operas  The appeal of the two struggling title characters landed a broad audience  especially during the Great Depression  NBC became home to many of the most popular performers and programs on the air  Al Jolson  Jack Benny  Edgar Bergen  Bob Hope  Fred Allen  and Burns and Allen called NBC home  as did Arturo Toscanini s NBC Symphony Orchestra  which the network helped him create  Other programs were Vic and Sade  Fibber McGee and Molly  The Great Gildersleeve  arguably broadcasting s first spin off program  from Fibber McGee   One Man s Family  Ma Perkins  and Death Valley Days  NBC stations were often the most powerful  and some occupied unique clear channel national frequencies  reaching many hundreds or thousands of miles at night  In the late 1940s  rival Columbia Broadcasting System  CBS  gained ground by allowing radio stars to use their own production companies  which was profitable for them  In early radio years  stars and programs commonly hopped between networks when their short term contracts expired  In 1948 49  beginning with the nation s top radio star  Jack Benny  many NBC performers  including Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy  Burns and Allen and Frank Sinatra  jumped to CBS  In addition  NBC stars began moving toward television  including comedian Milton Berle  whose Texaco Star Theater on NBC became television s first major hit  Conductor Arturo Toscanini conducted ten television concerts on NBC between 1948 and 1952  The concerts were simulcast on both TV and radio  perhaps the first such instance in which this was done  Two of them were historic firsts   the first complete telecast of Beethoven s Symphony No  9  and the first complete telecast of Verdi s Aida  performed in concert rather than with scenery and costumes  The Aida telecast starred Herva Nelli and Richard Tucker  Aiming to keep classic radio alive as television matured  and to challenge CBS s Sunday night radio lineup  much of which had jumped from NBC with Jack Benny  NBC launched The Big Show in November 1950  This 90 minute variety show updated radio s earliest musical variety style with sophisticated comedy and dramatic presentations  Featuring stage legend Tallulah Bankhead as hostess  it lured prestigious entertainers  including Fred Allen  Groucho Marx  Lauritz Melchior  Ethel Barrymore  Louis Armstrong  Ethel Merman  Bob Hope  Danny Thomas  Douglas Fairbanks  Jr   and Ella Fitzgerald  But The Big Show s initial success did not last despite critical praise  as most of its potential listeners were increasingly becoming television viewers  The show endured two years  with NBC losing perhaps a million dollars on the project  they were only able to sell advertising time during the middle half hour every week   NBC s last major radio programming push  beginning June 12  1955  was Monitor  a creation of NBC President Sylvester  Pat  Weaver  who also created the innovative NBC television programs Today Show  Tonight Show  and Home  Monitor was a continuous all weekend mixture of music  news  interviews and features  with a variety of hosts including well known television personalities Dave Garroway  Hugh Downs  Ed McMahon  Joe Garagiola and Gene Rayburn  The potpourri show tried to keep vintage radio alive by featuring segments from Jim and Marian Jordan  in character as Fibber McGee and Molly   Peg Lynch s dialog comedy Ethel and Albert  with Alan Bunce   and iconoclastic satirist Henry Morgan  Monitor was a success for a number of years  but after the mid 1960s  local stations  especially in larger markets  were reluctant to break from their established formats to run non conforming network programming  One exception was Toscanini  The Man Behind the Legend  a weekly series commemorating the great conductor s NBC broadcasts and recordings which began in 1963 and ran for several years  12  After Monitor went off the air January 26  1975  little remained of NBC network radio beyond hourly newscasts and news features  and The Eternal Light on Sunday mornings   edit  Last years of NBC Radio Beginning on June 18  1975  NBC launched the NBC News and Information Service  NIS   which provided up to 55 minutes of news per hour around the clock to local stations that wanted to adopt an all news format  NBC aired the service on WRC in Washington and on its owned and operated FM stations in New York  Chicago  and San Francisco  NIS attracted several dozen subscribing stations  but by the fall of 1976 NBC determined that it could not project that the service would ever become profitable and gave the subscribers six months  notice that it would be discontinued  NIS operations ended on May 29 1977  In 1979  NBC started The Source  a modestly successful secondary network providing news and short features to FM rock stations  The NBC Radio Network also pioneered personal advice call in national talk radio with a satellite distributed talk show in the evening entitled TalkNet  featuring Bruce Williams  personal financial advice   Bernard Meltzer  personal financial advice  and Sally Jesse Raphael  personal   romantic advice   While never much of a ratings success  TalkNet nonetheless helped further the national talk radio format  For affiliates  many of them struggling AM stations  TalkNet helped fill the evenings with free programming  allowing the stations to sell local advertising in a dynamic format without the cost associated with producing local programming  Some in the industry feared this trend would lead to ever more control of radio content by networks and syndicators  GE acquired RCA in 1986  and with it NBC  signaling the beginning of the end of NBC Radio  There were three factors that led to its demise  First  GE decided that radio did not fit its strategy  Second  the radio division had not been profitable for many years  Finally  FCC rules at the time prevented a new owner from owning both a radio and TV division  In the summer of 1987  GE sold NBC Radio s network operations to Westwood One  and sold off the NBC owned stations to different buyers  By 1990  the NBC Radio Network as an independent programming service was pretty much gone  becoming a brand name for content produced by Westwood One  and ultimately by  ironically  CBS Radio  The Mutual Broadcasting System  which Westwood One had acquired two years earlier  met the same fate  and essentially merged with NBC Radio  It should be noted that GE s divestiture of NBC s entire radio division was the first cannon shot of what would play out in the national broadcast media  as each of the Big 3 broadcast networks were soon acquired by other corporate entities  The NBC case was particularly noteworthy in that it was the first to be bought and was bought by a corporate behemoth outside the broadcast industry as GE is a manufacturer  Prior to the acquisition by GE  NBC operated its radio division partly out of tradition  and partly to meet its then FCC mandated requirement to distribute programming for the public good   The broadcast airwaves are owned by the public  that broadcast spectrum is limited  there are only so many broadcast stations to go around which was is the basis for broadcast regulation requiring certain content for the public good   Syndicators such as Westwood One were not subject to such rules as they owned no stations  Thus did GE s divestiture of NBC Radio    America s First Network    in many ways mark the  beginning of the end  of the old broadcasting era and the ushering in of the new  largely unregulated industry that we see today  By the late 1990s  Westwood One was producing NBC Radio branded newscasts  on weekday mornings only  In 1999  these were discontinued  and the few remaining NBC Radio Network affiliates began to receive CNN Radio branded newscasts around the clock  But in 2003  Westwood One began distributing a new service called NBC News Radio  consisting of one minute news updates read by television anchors and reporters from NBC News and MSNBC  The content  however  is written by employees of Westwood One   not NBC News   edit  Restoration of NBC Radio On March 1  2012 Dial Global announced the CNN Radio would be discontinued and replaced by an expansion of NBC News Radio on April 1  2012  This marks the first time since Westwood One bought NBC Radio and its properties that NBC would have round the clock presence on radio  A previous NBC program  First Light  placed new emphasis on the NBC brand after diminishing it over the years  NBC News Radio will offer 2 hourly full length newscasts 24 7  Previously  it had only offered 60 second updates during weekdays   edit  Television High frequency tubes in the tube room  They were used for the NBC television transmitter  1936  NBC kept 220 tubes in reserve for their transmitter  For many years NBC was closely identified with David Sarnoff  who used it as a vehicle to sell consumer electronics  It was Sarnoff who ruthlessly stole innovative ideas from competitors  citation needed  using RCA s muscle to prevail in the courts  citation needed  RCA and Sarnoff had dictated the broadcasting standards put in place by the FCC in 1938  citation needed  and captured the spotlight by introducing all electronic television to the public at the 1939 40 New York World s Fair  simultaneously initiating a regular schedule of programs on the NBC RCA television station in New York City  President Franklin D  Roosevelt appeared at the fair  before the NBC cameras  becoming the first U S  president to appear on television on April 30  1939  The David Sarnoff Library has available an actual  off the monitor photograph of the FDR telecast  The broadcast was transmitted by NBC s New York television station W2XBS Channel 1  now WNBC TV channel 4  and was seen by about one thousand viewers within the station s roughly 40 mile  64 km  coverage area from their Empire State Building transmitter location  The next day  May 1  four models of RCA television sets went on sale to the general public in various New York City department stores  promoted in a series of splashy newspaper ads  It is to be noted that DuMont  and others  actually offered the first home sets in 1938 in anticipation of NBC s announced April 1939 start up  Later in 1939  NBC took its cameras to professional football and baseball games in the New York City area  establishing many  firsts  in the history of television  Actual NBC  network  broadcasts  more than one station  began about this time with occasional special events   such as the British King and Queen s visit to the New York World s Fair   being seen in Philadelphia  over the station which would become WPTZ  now KYW  and in Schenectady  over the station which would become WRGB   two pioneer stations in their own right  The most ambitious NBC television  network  program of this pre war era was the telecasting of the Republican National Convention in 1940 from Philadelphia  which was fed live to New York and Schenectady  13  However  despite major promotion by RCA  television set sales in New York in the 1939 1940 period were disappointing  primarily due to the high cost of the sets  and the lack of compelling regular programming  Most sets were sold to bars  hotels and other public places  where the general public viewed special sporting and news events  30 Rockefeller Center  also known as the GE Building  is the world headquarters of NBC  Television s experimental period ended  and the FCC allowed full commercial telecasting to begin on July 1  1941  NBC s New York station W2XBS received the first commercial license  adopting the call letters WNBT  it is now WNBC TV   The first official  paid television commercial on that day broadcast by any station in the United States was for Bulova Watches  seen just before the start of a Brooklyn Dodgers baseball telecast on NBC s WNBT  New York  A test pattern  featuring the newly assigned WNBT call letters  was modified to look like a clock  complete with functioning hands  The Bulova logo  with the phrase  Bulova Watch Time   was shown in the lower right hand quadrant of the test pattern  A photograph of the NBC camera telecasting the test pattern advertisement for that first official TV commercial can be seen at this page  Among programming on the opening weekend of WNBT s programming was amateur boxing at Jamaica Arena  the Eastern Clay Courts tennis championships  programming from the USO  a spelling bee type game show called  Words on the Wing   a few feature films  and the television debut of the game show Truth or Consequences  14  Limited programming continued until the U S  entered World War II  Telecasts were curtailed in the early years of the war  then expanded as NBC began to prepare for full service upon the war s end  On V E Day  May 8  1945  WNBT broadcast hours of news coverage  and remotes from around New York City  This event was pre promoted by NBC with a direct mail card sent to television set owners in the New York area  15  At one point  a WNBT camera placed atop the marquee of the Hotel Astor panned the crowd below celebrating the end of the war in Europe  The vivid coverage was a prelude to television s rapid growth after the war ended  The NBC television network grew from its initial post war lineup of four stations  The 1947 World Series featured two New York teams  Yankees and Dodgers   and local TV sales boomed  since the games were telecast in New York  More stations along the East Coast and in the Midwest were connected by coaxial cable through the late 1940s  and in September 1951 the first transcontinental telecasts took place  The early 1950s brought success for NBC in the new medium  Television s first big star  Milton Berle  drew large audiences to NBC with his antics on Texaco Star Theater  Under its innovative president  Sylvester  Pat  Weaver  the network launched Today and The Tonight Show  which would bookend the broadcast day for over fifty years  and which still lead their competitors  Weaver  who also launched the genre of periodic 90 minute network  spectaculars   network produced motion pictures  and the live 90 minute Sunday afternoon series Wide Wide World  left the network in 1955 in a dispute with its chairman David Sarnoff  who subsequently named his son Robert Sarnoff as president  In 1951  NBC commissioned Italian American composer Gian Carlo Menotti to compose the first opera ever written for television  Menotti came up with Amahl and the Night Visitors  a forty five minute work for which he wrote both music and libretto  about a disabled shepherd boy who meets the Three Wise Men and is miraculously cured when he offers his crutch to the newborn Christ Child  It was such a stunning success that it was repeated every year on NBC from 1951 to 1966  when a quarrel between Menotti and NBC ended the broadcasts  However  by 1978  Menotti and NBC had patched things up  and an all new production of the work  filmed partly on location in the Middle East  was telecast that year   edit  Color television Main article  Color television While rivals CBS and DuMont also offered color broadcasting plans  RCA convinced a waffling FCC to approve its color system in December 1953  NBC was ready with color programming within days of the FCC s decision  NBC began with some shows in 1954  and that summer broadcast its first program to air all episodes in color  The Marriage  In 1955  on the television anthology Producers  Showcase  NBC broadcast a live production in color of Peter Pan  a new Broadway musical adaptation of J  M  Barrie s beloved play  with the musical s entire original cast  the first such telecast of its kind  Mary Martin starred as Peter and Cyril Ritchard played the dual role of Mr  Darling and Captain Hook  The broadcast drew the highest ratings for a television program up to then  It was so successful that NBC restaged it live a mere ten months later  and in 1960  long after Producers  Showcase had ended its run  Peter Pan  with most of the 1955 cast  was restaged again  this time as a TV special on its own  and videotaped so that it would no longer have to be done live on television  In 1956 during a National Association meeting in Chicago  NBC announced that its Chicago TV station WNBQ  now WMAQ TV  was the first color TV station in the nation  at least six hours of color broadcasts a day   The television edition of the radio program The Bell Telephone Hour premiered in color on NBC in 1959  where it continued for nine more years  In September 1961  the Walt Disney anthology television series moved from ABC to NBC  where the show continued its very long run  this time in color  As many of the Disney programs shown in black and white on ABC had actually been filmed in color  they could easily be repeated on the NBC edition of the program  The 1962 Rose Bowl was the first color television broadcast of a college football game  By 1963  much of NBC s prime time schedule was in color  although some popular programs like The Man from U N C L E   which premiered in late 1964  had their entire first season in black and white  In the fall of 1965  NBC achieved 95  color programming in prime time  the exceptions were I Dream of Jeannie and Convoy   and began billing itself as  The Full Color Network   Without television sets to sell  rival networks followed more slowly  finally committing to 100  prime time color programming in the 1966 67 season  Days of our Lives was the first soap opera to premiere in color  In 1967  NBC acquired MGM s classic 1939 film The Wizard of Oz after CBS  which had televised the film beginning in 1956  refused to meet MGM s increased price for more television showings  Oz had been  up to then  one of the few programs that CBS had telecast in color  but by 1967  color was the norm on TV  and the film became another in the list of color specials telecast by NBC  The network showed the film annually for eight years  beginning in 1968  after which CBS  realizing that they may have committed a colossal blunder by letting this then huge ratings success go to another network  now agreed to pay MGM more money so that the rights to show the film could revert to them  Two distinctive features of the film s showings on NBC were  the film was shown for the first time without a host to introduce it as had always been previously done  the film was slightly cut to make room for more commercials  Despite the cuts  however  it continued to score excellent television ratings in those pre VCR days  as audiences were generally unable to see the film any other way at that time   edit  1970s doldrums The 1970s started strongly for the network thanks to hits like Adam 12  Rowan  amp  Martin s Laugh In  Emergency   The Dean Martin Show  and The Flip Wilson Show  but this did not last  In spite of the success of such new shows as the NBC Mystery Movie  Sanford and Son  Chico and the Man  Little House on the Prairie  The Rockford Files  Police Woman and Quincy  M E   as well as continued success from veterans like The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and The Wonderful World of Disney  the network entered a slump in the middle of the decade  Disney  in particular  saw its ratings nosedive once CBS put 60 Minutes up against it in the 1975 1976 season  In 1974 under new president Herb Schlosser  the network tried to go after younger viewers with a series of costly movies  miniseries and specials  This failed to attract the desirable 18 34 demographic  and alienated older viewers  16  None of the new prime time shows NBC introduced in the fall of 1975 earned a second season  all failing in the face of established competition  The network s lone breakout success that season was the groundbreaking late night comedy variety show  NBC s Saturday Night   which would soon become Saturday Night Live  in a time slot previously held by reruns of The Tonight Show  In 1978  Schlosser was promoted to executive vice presidency at RCA  17  and a desperate NBC lured Fred Silverman away from number one ABC to turn the network s fortunes around  With the notable exceptions of Diff rent Strokes  Real People  The Facts of Life  and the mini series Shogun  he could not find a hit  Failures accumulated rapidly under his watch  such as Hello  Larry  Supertrain  Pink Lady and Jeff  and The Waverly Wonders   Ironically many of them were beaten in the ratings by shows Silverman had greenlighted at CBS and ABC  Also during this time  NBC suffered the defections of several longtime affiliates in markets such as  Atlanta  WSB TV   Baltimore  WBAL TV   Baton Rouge  WBRZ TV   Charlotte  WSOC TV   Dayton  WDTN   Indianapolis  WRTV   Jacksonville  WTLV   Minneapolis St  Paul  KSTP TV   San Diego  KGTV  and Schenectady  WRGB   Most were wooed away by ABC  which was the number one network during the late 1970s and early 1980s  while WBAL TV and WRGB TV went to CBS  In the case of WSB TV and WSOC TV  both were  and remain  under common ownership with Cox Communications  with its other NBC affiliate at the time  WIIC TV in Pittsburgh  which would become WPXI the following year and also remains owned by Cox   only remaining with the network because WIIC TV itself was in a distant third to then CBS affiliate and Group W powerhouse KDKA TV  amp  pre existing ABC affiliate WTAE TV   KDKA TV  which is now owned by CBS  infamously passed up affiliating with NBC after Westinghouse Electric bought the station from DuMont in 1954  leading to an acrimonious relationship between NBC and Westinghouse for years afterward   In markets such as San Diego  Charlotte  and Jacksonville  NBC was forced to replace the lost stations with new affiliates broadcasting on the UHF band  with the San Diego station  KNSD  eventually becoming an NBC O amp O  Other smaller television markets like Yuma  Arizona waited many years to get another local NBC affiliate  see TV stations KIVA and KYMA   The stations in Baltimore  Dayton and Jacksonville  however  have since rejoined the network  When U S  President Jimmy Carter pulled the American team out of the 1980 Summer Olympics  NBC canceled a planned 150 hours of coverage  which had cost  87 million   and the network s future was in doubt  It had been counting on  170 million in advertising revenues and on the broadcasts to help promote fall shows  18  The press was merciless towards Silverman  but the two most savage attacks on his leadership came from within  The company that composed NBC s on air Proud as a Peacock promo music created a spoof of the ad campaign called  Loud as a Peacock   Radio host Don Imus at WNBC in New York played the parody on air  This angered Silverman and he ordered all remaining copies of the parody destroyed  though some copies remain  On Saturday Night Live  series writer and occasional performer Al Franken satirized Silverman in an SNL sketch titled  Limo for a Lame O   As a result  Silverman admitted he  never liked Al Franken to begin with   and the sketch ruined Franken s chance of succeeding Lorne Michaels as executive producer of SNL  19   edit  Tartikoff s turnaround In the summer of 1981  Fred Silverman resigned  Grant Tinker became president of the network and Brandon Tartikoff became chief of programming  Tartikoff inherited a schedule full of aging dramas and very few sitcoms  but showed patience with promising programs  One such show was the critically acclaimed Hill Street Blues  which rated poorly in its first season  Instead of canceling it  he moved the Emmy Award winning police drama to Thursday night where its ratings improved dramatically  He used the same tactics with St  Elsewhere and Cheers  Shows like these were able to get the same ad revenue as their higher rated  mass audience competition because of their desirable demographics  upscale  18 34 year old viewers  20  While the network claimed moderate successes with Gimme a Break   Silver Spoons  Knight Rider and Remington Steele  its biggest hit in this period was The A Team  which  at tenth place  was the network s only top 20 rated show of the 1982 1983 season  and it reached third place the next year  These shows helped NBC through the disastrous 1983 84 season  in which none of its new fall shows gained a second year  21  In 1982  NBC canceled Tom Snyder s The Tomorrow Show and gave the time slot to 34 year old comedian David Letterman  Though Letterman had an unsuccessful daytime series in 1980  Late Night with David Letterman proved much more successful  In 1984  the huge success of The Cosby Show led to a renewed interest in sitcoms  while Family Ties and Cheers  both of which premiered in 1982 to mediocre ratings  saw their viewership increase from having Cosby as a lead in  The network moved from third place to second place that season  It reached first place in the Nielsen rankings in the 1985 86 season  with hits The Golden Girls  Miami Vice  227  Night Court  Highway to Heaven  and Hunter  The network s upswing continued through the decade with ALF  Amen  Matlock  L A  Law  The Hogan Family  A Different World  Empty Nest  and In the Heat of the Night  In 1986  Bob Wright became chairman of NBC  In the 1988 1989 season  NBC  which was home to an astonishing 18 of the 30 highest rated programs  won every week in the ratings for more than 12 months  an achievement that has not been duplicated before or since  NBC aired the first of seven consecutive Summer Olympic Games broadcasts when it covered the 1988 Games in Seoul  South Korea  In 2002  the network would add the Winter Olympics  giving NBC the rights to every Olympics through the 2012 London Games   edit   Must See TV  Main article  Must See TV In 1991  Tartikoff left NBC to take a position at Paramount Pictures  In one decade he had taken control of a network with no shows in the Nielsen Top 10 and left it with five  Warren Littlefield took his place as president of NBC Entertainment  His start was shaky due to the end of most of the Tartikoff era hits  Some blamed him for losing David Letterman to CBS after giving The Tonight Show to Jay Leno  following Johnny Carson s 1992 retirement  Things turned around with hit series Friends  Mad About You  Frasier  ER  and Will  amp  Grace  One of Tartikoff s late acquisitions  Seinfeld  initially struggled  but became one of NBC s top rated shows after it was moved into the timeslot following Cheers  The Must See TV tag line was applied to Thursday night s strong lineup  After popular show Seinfeld ended its run in 1998  Friends became the most popular sitcom on NBC  It dominated the ratings  never leaving the top 5 watched shows of the year in its second through tenth season and landing on the number 1 spot in season eight  2001 2002 season   Frasier was also popular and  despite not being as highly rated as Friends  still usually landed in the top 20 and won numerous Emmy Awards  By the mid 1990s  NBC s sports division  headed by Dick Ebersol  had rights to three of the four major professional sports organizations  NFL  Major League Baseball and NBA   the Olympics  and the national powerhouse Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team  The NBA on NBC enjoyed great success in the 90s due in large part to the Chicago Bulls  run of six championships with superstar Michael Jordan  NBC Sports would suffer a major blow in 1998  however  when it lost the NFL to CBS  which itself had lost rights to FOX four years earlier  In 1998  Littlefield left NBC  22 Scott Sassa replaced him as president of NBC Entertainment  Sassa oversaw the development of such shows as The West Wing  Law  amp  Order  Special Victims Unit  and Fear Factor  Sassa then named Garth Ancier as his replacement in 1999  Ancier was responsible for putting The West Wing on the air  Jeff Zucker replaced Ancier as president of NBC Entertainment in 2000  NBC s Must See TV declined after Friends and Frasier ended their runs in 2004  Friends spin off Joey  despite a relatively good start  started to fail during its second season   edit  New century  new problems At the start of the 2000s  NBC s fortunes took a rapid turn for the worse  In 2001  CBS chose its hit reality series Survivor to anchor its Thursday night line up  Its success was taken as a suggestion that NBC s nearly two decades of Thursday night dominance could be broken  With the loss of Friends and Frasier in 2004  NBC was left with several moderately rated shows and few true hits  By then  its major sports offerings had been reduced to the Olympics  PGA Tour golf and a floundering Notre Dame football program  NBC s ratings fell to fourth place  CBS led for most of the decade  followed by a resurgent ABC  and Fox  which would eventually become the most watched network for the 2007 08 season   During this time  all of the networks faced shrinking audiences due to increased competition from cable  home video  videogames and the internet  with NBC being the hardest hit  With the beginning of the 2004 2005 season  NBC became the first major network to produce its programming in widescreen  hoping to attract new viewers  however  the network saw only a slight boost  In 2004  Zucker was promoted to the newly created position of president of NBC Universal Television Group  Kevin Riley became the new president of NBC Entertainment  In December 2005  NBC began its first week long primetime game show event  Deal or No Deal  garnering high ratings  and returning multi weekly in March 2006  On sustained success  Deal or No Deal returned in the fall of 2006  Otherwise  the 2005 06 season was one of the worst for NBC in three decades  with only one fall series  the sitcom My Name Is Earl  surviving for a second season  The 2006 07 season was a mixed bag  with Heroes becoming a surprise hit on Monday nights  while the highly touted Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip  from the creator of NBC s hit drama The West Wing  lost a third of its premiere night viewers by week six and was eventually canceled  Sunday Night NFL football returned to NBC after eight years  Deal or No Deal stayed strong  and its comedies The Office and 30 Rock won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series for four consecutive years  However  NBC has remained in a very distant fourth place  barely ahead of The CW  However  NBC did gain success in its summer schedule  despite its falling ratings within the regular broadcast season  America s Got Talent  a reality talent show hosted by Regis Philbin  with its world premiere in 2006  gained a 4 6 rating in the 18 49 demographic  which was higher than the original premiere of FOX s American Idol in 2002  The show would continue to garner unusually high ratings throughout its summer run  However  NBC decided not to place it in the spring season  and instead use it as a platform to promote their upcoming fall shows  The show is now hosted by Nick Cannon  and continues to garner high ratings throughout its summer seasons  In 2007  Ben Silverman replaced Kevin Riley as president of NBC Entertainment  while Jeff Zucker succeeded Bob Wright as CEO of NBC  No new primetime hits emerged in the 2008 2009 season  despite NBC s rare good fortune to have both the Super Bowl and the Beijing Olympic Games in which to promote their new offerings   while Heroes and Deal or No Deal both collapsed in the ratings  and both have since been cancelled  NBC Universal President CEO Jeff Zucker had previously said that NBC no longer believed that they could be No 1 in prime time  23  In March 2007  NBC announced that it would offer full length prime time television shows like The Office and Heroes on demand to play on mobile phones  This was a first for the United States  as the market shifts away from traditional television  24  In 2009  Jeff Gaspin replaced Ben Silverman as president of NBC Entertainment   edit  2010 and beyond See also  2010 Tonight Show conflict NBC aired the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver  generating 21  higher ratings than its previous broadcast of the 2006 games in Torino  NBC was criticized for repeatedly showing footage of the death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili  This led NBC News president Steve Capus to order the footage not to be shown without his permission and announcer Bob Costas to promise that the video would not be shown again during the Games  25  26  NBC Universal is on track to pull in at least  250 million less from advertisers than the  820 million paid for the US rights to air the Games  27  Even so  with its continuing position in fourth place  although it virtually tied with ABC in many categories due to the sporting events 28    the 2009 2010 season ended with only two scripted shows   Community and Parenthood  as well as three unscripted shows   The Marriage Ref  Who Do You Think You Are   and Minute to Win It   to be renewed for second terms  while others such as Heroes and Law  amp  Order were canceled  the latter of which after 20 seasons  tying it with Gunsmoke for the record for longest running scripted drama  When Conan O Brien replaced Jay Leno as host of The Tonight Show in 2009  the network gave Leno a new talk show  committing to air it every weeknight at 10 00 pm ET PT  9 00 pm CT MT   as an inexpensive comedic alternative to the procedurals and other one hour dramas that typically air during that time slot  29  In doing so  NBC became the first large United States network in decades  30  or possibly ever  31  to broadcast the same show every weekday during prime time hours  Its executives called the decision  a transformational moment in the history of broadcasting  and  in effect  launching five shows   30  Conversely  industry executives criticized the network for abandoning a history of airing quality dramas at that hour  and that it would hurt NBC by undermining a reputation built on successful scripted shows  32  In January 2010  however  NBC would end up announcing that Leno s 10 pm show would be canceled  citing complaints from many affiliates  whose local newscasts significantly dropped in the ratings as a result of the change  33  Zucker attempted to move and shorten The Jay Leno Show to the 11 35 pm 12 05 am time slot and move the existing shows  including The Tonight Show  back 30 minutes  This  however  caused considerable backlash  as O Brien had not been given any choice or prior notification of the move  Furthermore  his contract guaranteed him a minimum of three years as host and the majority of his staff had moved with him from New York to California less than a year before the show started  O Brien refused to be a part of the moves if they went through  gaining tremendous public and professional support  and leading to a host and timeslot conflict  with Leno  Zucker and NBC as a whole having seen significant negative backlash against them for their involvement  Leno would end up returning as host of The Tonight Show effective March 1  2010  while O Brien accepted a buyout from NBC  O Brien went on to host a new show  Conan  on cable network TBS starting in November 2010  Despite the removal of The Jay Leno Show in prime time  the change had almost no impact on the network s ratings  The increases NBC noticed in the 2010 season compared to 2009 were almost entirely attributable to increased ratings for NBC Sunday Night Football  34  The shows currently in the time slots The Jay Leno Show occupied are drawing lower numbers than The Jay Leno Show did  35  Jeff Zucker announced on September 24  2010 that he would step down as CEO of NBC Universal once Comcast s purchase of NBC was completed at the end of the year  After the purchase was complete  Steve Burke became the new CEO of NBC Universal and Robert Greenblatt replaced Jeff Gaspin as chairman of NBC Entertainment  The network completed its full conversion to an all HD schedule  outside of the Saturday morning hours leased by the Qubo consortium  on September 20  2011  with the premiere of the eleventh season of Last Call with Carson Daly in the format  By midseason 2010 2011  NBC was able to find some success with the legal drama Harry s Law  which actually placed in the top 30  but scored horribly with 18 49  On the other hand  a new reality series  The Voice became an even greater ratings hit for the network  Following its broadcast of Super Bowl XLVI in February 2012  The Voice returned for its second season with 37 61 million viewers  Since then  NBC has become number one on Monday nights with the series and the

breakthrough television shows  The series  which ran for 13 years  featured a freckle faced marionette and a myriad of other characters and hosted by  Buffalo  Bob Smith  Howdy Doody spent most of its run on weekday afternoons  In 1956  NBC abandoned the children s programming lineup on weekday afternoons  relegating the lineup to Saturdays only with Howdy Doody as their marquee franchise for the series  remaining four years  From the mid 1960s until 1992  the bulk of NBC s children s programming was derived from theatrical shorts like The Pink Panther Show and Looney Tunes  reruns of popular television series like The Flintstones and The Jetsons  foreign acquisitions like Astro Boy and Kimba the White Lion  original animated series  most notably The Smurfs and Alvin and the Chipmunks in
