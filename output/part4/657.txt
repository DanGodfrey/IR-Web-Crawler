populated very early  between 14 000 and 5000 BC  by hunter gatherers in the northwestern part of the country  whose tools  such as scrapers  chisels and arrowheads  were discovered in 1973 by Simran Nijjar  Settlements with farmers appeared between 3600 and 2600 BC  On the basis of traces of the farmers  structures  the settlements appear to have been permanent  The use of iron  ceramics and polished stone developed between 1500 and 1000 BC  as well as a preoccupation with spiritual matters  as shown by burial remains  Relics of the Dogon are found in Burkina Faso s north and northwest regions  Sometime between the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries  the Dogon left the area to settle in the cliffs of Bandiagara  Elsewhere  the remains of high walls are localized in the southwest of Burkina Faso  as well as in the C te d Ivoire   but the people who built them have not yet been identified  The central part of Burkina Faso included a number of Mossi kingdoms  the most powerful of which were those of Wagadogo  Ouagadougou  and Yatenga  These kingdoms emerged probably in the early sixteenth century from obscure origins veiled by legend featuring a heterogeneous set of warrior figures  5   edit  From colony to independence Traditional homes in south east Burkina Faso Traditional Tiebele house decoration After a decade of intense rivalry and competition between the British and the French  waged through treaty making expeditions under military or civilian explorers  the Mossi kingdom of Ouagadougou was defeated by French colonial forces and became a French protectorate in 1896  The eastern region and the western region  where a standoff against the forces of the powerful ruler Samori Ture complicated the situation  came under French occupation in 1897  By 1898  the majority of the territory corresponding to Burkina Faso today was nominally conquered  however  control of many parts remained uncertain  The French and British convention of 14 June 1898 ended the scramble between the two colonial powers and drew the borders between the countries  colonies  On the French side  a war of conquest against local communities and political powers continued for about five years  In 1904  the largely pacified territories of the Volta basin were integrated into the Upper Senegal and Niger colony of French West Africa as part of the reorganization of the French West African colonial empire  The colony had its capital in Bamako  Draftees from the territory participated in the European fronts of World War I in the battalions of the Senegalese Rifles  Between 1915 and 1916  the districts in the western part of what is now Burkina Faso and the bordering eastern fringe of Mali became the stage of one of the most important armed oppositions to colonial government  known as the Volta Bani War  6  The French government finally suppressed the movement  but only after suffering defeats and being forced to gather the largest expeditionary force of its colonial history up to that point  Armed opposition also wracked the Sahelian north when the Tuareg and allied groups of the Dori region ended their truce with the government  French Upper Volta was established on 1 March 1919  This move was a result of French fears of the recurrence of armed uprising along with economic considerations  and to bolster its administration  the colonial government separated the present territory of Burkina Faso from Upper Senegal and Niger  The new colony was named Haute Volta and Fran ois Charles Alexis  douard Hesling became its first governor  Hesling initiated an ambitious road making program and promoted the growth of cotton for export  The cotton policy   based on coercion   failed  and revenue stagnated  The colony was later dismantled on 5 September 1932  being split up between the C te d Ivoire  French Sudan and Niger  C te d Ivoire received the largest share  which contained most of the population as well as the cities of Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso  Children during the 1983 1987 revolution The decision to split the colony was reversed during the intense anti colonial agitation that followed the end of World War II  On 4 September 1947  the colony was revived as a part of the French Union  with its previous boundaries  On 11 December 1958  it achieved self government and became the Republic of Upper Volta and a member of the Franco African Community  A revision in the organization of French Overseas Territories began with the passage of the Basic Law  Loi Cadre  of 23 July 1956  This act was followed by reorganizational measures approved by the French parliament early in 1957 to ensure a large degree of self government for individual territories  Upper Volta became an autonomous republic in the French community on 11 December 1958  Full independence from France was received in 1960   edit  Upper Volta Main article  Republic of Upper Volta A railway station in Bobo Dioulasso  built during the colonial era  still in operation The Republic of Upper Volta  French  R publique de Haute Volta  was established on 11 December 1958  as a self governing colony within the French Community  The name Upper Volta indicated that the country is situated on the upper reaches of the Volta River  The river s three tributaries are called the Black Volta  White Volta and Red Volta  and the colors of the national flag corresponded to these parts of the river system  Before attaining autonomy it had been French Upper Volta and part of the French Union  On 5 August 1960  it attained full independence from France  The first president  Maurice Yam ogo  was the leader of the Voltaic Democratic Union  UDV   The 1960 constitution provided for election by universal suffrage of a president and a national assembly for five year terms  Soon after coming to power  Yam ogo banned all political parties other than the UDV  The government lasted until 1966 when after much unrest mass demonstrations and strikes by students  labor unions  and civil servants the military intervened  The military coup deposed Yam ogo  suspended the constitution  dissolved the National Assembly  and placed Lt  Col  Sangoul  Lamizana at the head of a government of senior army officers  The army remained in power for four years  and on 14 June 1970  the Voltans ratified a new constitution that established a four year transition period toward complete civilian rule  Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s as president of military or mixed civil military governments  After conflict over the 1970 constitution  a new constitution was written and approved in 1977  and Lamizana was reelected by open elections in 1978  Lamizana s government faced problems with the country s traditionally powerful trade unions  and on 25 November 1980  Col  Saye Zerbo overthrew President Lamizana in a bloodless coup  Colonel Zerbo established the Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress as the supreme governmental authority  thus eradicating the 1977 constitution  Colonel Zerbo also encountered resistance from trade unions and was overthrown two years later  on 7 November 1982  by Maj  Dr  Jean Baptiste Ou draogo and the Council of Popular Salvation  CSP   The CSP continued to ban political parties and organizations  yet promised a transition to civilian rule and a new constitution  Factional infighting developed between moderates in the CSP and the radicals  led by Capt  Thomas Sankara  who was appointed prime minister in January 1983  The internal political struggle and Sankara s leftist rhetoric led to his arrest and subsequent efforts to bring about his release  directed by Capt  Blaise Compaor   This release effort resulted in yet another military coup d  tat on 4 August 1983  After the coup  Sankara formed the National Council for the Revolution  CNR   with himself as president  Sankara also established Committees for the Defense of the Revolution  CDRs  to  mobilize the masses  and implement the CNR s revolutionary programs  The CNR  whose exact membership remained secret until the end  contained two small intellectual Marxist Leninist groups  Sankara  Compaore  Capt  Henri Zongo  and Maj  Jean Baptiste Lingani all leftist military officers dominated the regime  On 4 August 1984  as a final result of President Sankara s zealous activities  the country s name was eventually changed from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso  which translates to  land of honest people   7   edit  Burkina Faso On 15 October 1987 Sankara was killed by an armed gang with twelve other officials in a coup d  tat organized by his former colleague  Blaise Compaor   Deterioration in relations with neighbouring countries was one of the reasons given  with Compaore stating that Sankara jeopardised foreign relations with former colonial power France and neighbouring Ivory Coast  Prince Johnson  a former Liberian warlord allied to Charles Taylor  told Liberia s Truth and Reconciliation Commission  TRC  that it was engineered by Charles Taylor  After the coup and although Sankara was known to be dead  some CDRs mounted an armed resistance to the army for several days  Sankara s body was dismembered and he was quickly buried in an unmarked grave  while his widow and two children fled the nation  Compaor  immediately reversed the nationalizations  overturned nearly all of Sankara s policies  returned the country back under the IMF fold  and ultimately spurned most of Sankara s legacy  As of 2010  Compaor  is entering his 23rd year in power  He  has become immensely wealthy  and purchased a presidential plane to reflect his personal prestige  while landlocked Burkina Faso ranks as the third least developed country in the world  In February April 2011  the death of a schoolboy provoked an uprising throughout the country  coupled with a military mutiny and a strike of the magistrates  dubbed the 2011 Burkinab  protests   edit  Politics Main article  Politics of Burkina Faso Former prime minister Tertius Zongo With French help  the incumbent Blaise Compaor  seized power in a coup d  tat in 1987  betraying his long time friend and ally Thomas Sankara  who was killed in the coup  8  The constitution of 2 June 1991 established a semi presidential government with a parliament which can be dissolved by the President of the Republic  who is elected for a term of seven years  In 2000  the constitution was amended to reduce the presidential term to five years  The amendment took effect during the 2005 elections  The amendment also would have prevented the incumbent president  Blaise Compaor   from being reelected  However  in October 2005  notwithstanding a challenge by other presidential candidates  the constitutional council ruled that  because Compaor  was the sitting president in 2000  the amendment would not apply to him until the end of his second term in office  This cleared the way for his candidacy in the 2005 election  On 13 November  Compaor  was reelected in a landslide  because of a divided political opposition  In the 2010 November Presidential elections  President Compaor  was reelected for another term in office  Only 1 6 million Burkinab s voted  out of a total population 10 times that size  The parliament consists of one chamber known as the National Assembly which has 111 seats with members elected to serve five year terms  There is also a constitutional chamber  composed of ten members  and an economic and social council whose roles are purely consultative  Political freedoms are severely restricted in Burkina Faso  with human rights organizations decrying numerous acts of state sponsored violence against journalists and other politically active members of society   edit  Regions

security forces Main article  Military of Burkina Faso The country employs numerous police and security forces  generally modeled after organizations used by French police  and France continues to provide significant support and training to police forces in Burkina Faso  9  The Gendarmerie Nationale is organized along military lines  with most police services delivered at the brigade level  10  The Gendarmerie operates under the authority of the Minister of Defence  and its members are employed chiefly in the rural areas and along borders  10  There is also a municipal police force controlled by the Ministry of Territorial Administration  a national police force controlled by the Ministry of Security  and an autonomous Presidential Security Regiment  R giment de la S curit  Pr

police functions  the former are detailed to protect public order and provide security  the latter are charged with criminal investigations  10  All foreigners and citizens are required to carry photo ID passports  or other forms of identification or risk a fine  and police spot identity checks are commonplace for persons traveling by auto  bush taxi  or bus  11  12  The army consists of some 6 000 men in voluntary service  augmented by a part time national People s Militia composed of civilians between 25 and 35 years of age who are trained in both military and civil duties  According to Jane s Sentinel Country Risk Assessment  Burkina Faso s Army is undermanned for its force structure and poorly equipped  but has numbers of wheeled light armour vehicles  and may have developed useful combat expertise through interventions in Liberia and elsewhere in Africa  In terms of training and equipment  the regular Army is believed to be neglected in relation to the  lite Presidential Security Regiment  RSP   Reports have emerged in recent years of disputes over pay and conditions  13  There is an air force with some 19 operational aircraft  but no navy  as the country is landlocked  Military expenses constitute approximately 1 2  of the nation s GDP  In April 2011  there was an army mutiny  the president named new chiefs of staff  and a curfew was imposed in Ouagadougou  14

lies mostly between latitudes 9  and 15 N  a small area is north of 15    and longitudes 6 W and 3 E  It is made up of two major types of countryside  The larger part of the country is covered by a peneplain  which forms a gently undulating landscape with  in some areas  a few isolated hills  the last vestiges of a Precambrian massif  The southwest of the country  on the other hand  forms a sandstone massif  where the highest peak  T nakourou  is found at an elevation of 749 meters  2 457 ft   The massif is bordered by sheer cliffs up to 150 meters  492 ft  high  The average altitude of Burkina Faso is 400 meters  1 312 ft  and the difference between the highest and lowest terrain is no greater than 600 meters  1 969 ft   Burkina Faso is therefore a relatively flat country  The country owes its former name of Upper Volta to three rivers which cross it  the Black Volta  or Mouhoun   the White Volta  Nakamb   and the Red Volta  Nazinon   The Black Volta is one of the country s only two rivers which flow year round  the other being the Komo   which flows to the southwest  The basin of the Niger River also drains 27  of the country s surface  The Niger s tributaries   the B li  the Gorouol  the Goud bo and the Dargol   are seasonal streams and flow for only four to six months a year  They still can flood and overflow  however  The country also contains numerous lakes   the principal ones are Tingrela  Bam and Dem  The country contains large ponds  as well  such as Oursi  B li  Yomboli and Markoye  Water shortages are often a problem  especially in the north of the

destination for Burkinabe emigrants  forced many to return home  Remittances now account for less than 1  of GDP  Burkina Faso is part of the West African Monetary and Economic Union  UMEOA  and has thus adopted the CFA Franc  which is issued by the Central Bank of the West African States  BCEAO   situated in Dakar  Senegal  The BCEAO is not only responsible for the monetary and reserve policy of the member states  but also for the regulation and oversight of financial sector and banking activity  A legal framework regarding licensing  bank activities  organizational and capital requirements

same time keeping the quality of infrastructure high  less than 18  of the water is lost through leaks   one of the lowest in sub Saharan Africa   improving financial reporting and an average 12  annual revenue increase  well above inflation   21  Challenges remain  including the some customers  ability to pay and a reliance on aid for the expansion of its infrastructure  21  However  the

groups the Voltaic and the Mande  whose common language is Dioula   The Voltaic Mossi make up about one half of the population  The Mossi claim descent from warriors who migrated to present day Burkina Faso from Ghana and established an empire that lasted more than 800 years  Predominantly farmers  the Mossi kingdom is still led by the Mogho Naba  whose court is in Ouagadougou  22  Burkina Faso is an ethnically integrated  secular state  Most of Burkina s people are concentrated in the south and center of the country  sometimes exceeding 48 per square kilometer  125 sq  mi    Hundreds of thousands of Burkinabe migrate to C te d Ivoire and Ghana  many for seasonal agricultural work  These flows of workers are obviously affected by external events  the September 2002 coup attempt in C te d Ivoire and the ensuing fighting there have meant that hundreds of thousands of Burkinabe returned to Burkina Faso  22   edit  Health Main article  Health in Burkina Faso Average life expectancy

have other religions  and 0 4  have none  atheism is virtually nonexistent   28  29  A popular saying in Burkina Faso claims that  50  are Muslim  50  are Christian  and 100  are animist   This shows the large level of acceptance of the various religions amongst each other  Even for Muslims and Christians  ancient animist rites are still highly valued  The Great Mosque of Bobo Dioulasso was built by people of different faiths working together   edit  Culture Main article  Culture of Burkina Faso Literature in Burkina Faso is based on the oral tradition  which remains important  In 1934  during French occupation  Dim Dolobsom Ouedraogo published his Maximes  pens es et devinettes mossi  Maximes  Thoughts and Riddles of the Mossi   a record of the oral history of the Mossi people  30  The oral tradition continued to have an influence on Burkinab  writers in the post independence Burkina Faso of the 1960s  such as Nazi Boni and Roger Nikiema  31  The 1960s saw a growth in the number of playwrights being published  30  Since the 1970s  literature has developed in Burkina Faso with many more writers being published  32  The theatre of Burkina Faso combines traditional Burkinab  performance with the colonial influences and post colonial efforts to educate rural people to produce a distinctive national theatre  Traditional ritual ceremonies of the many ethnic groups in Burkina Faso have long involved dancing with masks  Western style theatre became common during colonial times  heavily influenced by French theatre  With independence came a new style of theatre inspired by forum theatre aimed at educating and entertaining Burkina Faso s rural people   edit  Arts and Crafts Artisan garland of decorative painted gourds in Ouagadougou There is also a large artist community

or Palm Wine  which is fermented palm sap  and Zoom kom  Especially the town of Banfora is known for its good quality Banji  though one should be wary of the Banji sold by hawkers as it is often not very fresh and may contain added water  On 30 August 2009  Burkina Faso experienced the worst flood in the country s recent history  leaving 150 000 people homeless  and more than 8 people dead  Burkina Faso people requested international aid to help the victims and rebuild the country  Japan  France  Ivory Coast and the European Union responded  while the Burkina American community requested that the president of the United States of America extend a helping hand to the victims of the flood  As a result of the flood  access to clean water has been difficult for survivors   edit  Cinema

cinema started with the establishment of the film festival FESPACO  Festival Panafricain du Cin ma et de la T l vision de Ouagadougou   which was launched as a film week in 1969  Many of the nation s filmmakers are known internationally and have won international prizes  For many years the headquarters of the Federation of Panafrican Filmmakers  FEPACI  was in Ouagadougou  rescued in 1983 from a period of moribund inactivity by the enthusiastic support and funding of President Sankara  In 2006 the Secretariat of FEPACI moved to South Africa but the headquarters of the organization is still in

assassinated by unknown assailants  and the bodies burned  The crime was never solved  42  However  an independent Commission of Inquiry later concluded that Norbert Zongo was killed for political reasons because of his investigative work into the death of David Ouedraogo  a chauffeur who worked for Fran ois Compaor   President Blaise Compaor  s brother  In January 1999  Fran ois Compaor  was charged with the murder of David Ouedraogo  who had died as a result of torture in January 1998  The charges were later dropped by a military tribunal after an appeal  In August 2000  five members of the President s personal security guard detail  R giment de la S curit  Pr sidentielle  or RSP  were charged with the murder of Ouedraogo  RSP members Marcel Kafando  Edmond Koama  and Ousseini Yaro

regarding the Zongo investigation and treatment of journalists have been prevented or dispersed by government police and security forces  In April 2007  popular radio reggae host Karim Sama  whose programs feature reggae songs interspersed with critical commentary on alleged government injustice and corruption  received several death threats  45  Sama s personal car was later burned outside the private radio station Ouaga FM by unknown vandals  46  In response  the Committee to Protect Journalists  CPJ  wrote to President Compaor  to request his government investigate the sending of e mailed death threats to journalists and radio commentators in Burkina Faso who were critical of the government  42  In December 2008  police in Ouagadougou questioned leaders of a protest march that called for a renewed investigation into the unsolved Zongo assassination  Among the marchers was Jean Claude Meda  the president of the Association of Journalists of Burkina Faso  47   edit  See also
