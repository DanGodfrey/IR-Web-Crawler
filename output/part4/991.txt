1 Interviews  edit  Early life and career Peter David s paternal grandparents  Martin and Hela David  and Peter s father  Gunter  came to the United States in the 1930s after the political situation in Nazi Germany deteriorated to the point that Martin s Berlin shoestore became the target of antisemitic vandalism  7  8  9  David was born September 23  1956 in Fort Meade  Maryland 1  to Gunter and Dalia  10  an Israeli born Jewish mother  11  12  13  to whom David credits for his sense of humor  10  He has two siblings  14  a younger brother named Wally  15  who works as a still life photographer 16  and musician  dead link  17  and a sister named Beth  18  19  David first became interested in comics when he was about five years old  reading copies of Harvey Comics  Casper and Wendy in a barbershop  He became interested in superheroes through the Adventures of Superman TV series  20  His favorite title was Superman  2  21  and he cites John Buscema as his favorite pre 1970 s artist  22  David s earliest interest in writing came through the journalism work of his father  Gunter  who would sometimes review movies  and take young Peter along if it was age appropriate  While Gunter would write his reviews back at the newspaper s office  Peter would write his own  portions of which would sometimes find their way into Gunter s published reviews  21  23  David began to entertain the notion of becoming a professional writer at age twelve  buying a copy of The Guide to the Writer s Market  and subscribing to similar themed magazines  24  in the hopes of becoming a reporter  2  David lived initially in Bloomfield  New Jersey  25  where he attended Demarest Elementary School  26  but later moved to Verona  New Jersey  where he spent his adolescence  David s best friend in junior high and freshman year in high school  Keith  was gay  and David has described how both of them were targets of ostracism and harassment from homophobes  Although his family eventually moved to Pennsylvania  27  his experiences in Verona soured him on that town  and would shape his liberal sociopolitical positions regarding LGBT issues  He would later make Verona the home location of villain Morgan le Fay in his novel Knight Life  and has often discussed his progressive views on LGBT issues in his column and on his blog  28  29  30  A seminal moment in the course of his aspirations occurred when he met writer Stephen King at a book signing  and told him that he was an aspiring writer  King signed David s copy of Danse Macabre with the inscription   Good luck with your writing career    which David now inscribes himself onto books presented to him by fans who tell him the same thing  31  Other authors that David cites as influences include Harlan Ellison  Arthur Conan Doyle  Robert B  Parker  Neil Gaiman  32 Terry Pratchett  21 Robert Crais 23  and Edgar Rice Burroughs  33  Specific books he has mentioned as favorites include To Kill a Mockingbird  Tarzan of the Apes  The Princess Bride  The Essential Ellison  A Confederacy of Dunces  34 Adams Versus Jefferson  and Don Quixote  23  David has singled out Ellison in particular as a writer whom he has tried to emulate  35  David attended New York University  where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism  His first professional assignment was covering the World Science Fiction Convention held in Washington in 1974 for the Philadelphia Bulletin  21  36  David eventually gravitated towards fiction after his attempts at journalism did not meet with success  2  His first published fiction was in Asimov s Science Fiction  He also sold an Op ed piece to The New York Times  however  his submissions overall were met with rejection that far outnumbered those accepted  37   edit  Comic book career Peter David and Larry Stroman at a comic book signing for X Factor in the early 1990 s David eventually gave up on a career in writing  and came to work in book publishing  first for Elseviser Nelson  38  and later working in sales and distribution for Playboy Paperbacks  He subsequently worked for five years in Marvel Comics  Sales Department  first as Assistant Direct Sales Manager under Carol Kalish  who hired him  and then succeeding Kalish as Sales Manager  21  39  40  During this time he made some cursory attempts to sell stories  including submission of some Moon Knight plots to Dennis O Neil  but his efforts were unfruitful  41  Three years into his tenure as Direct Sales Manager  Jim Owsley became editor of the Spider Man titles  Although crossing over from sales into editorial was considered a conflict of interest in the Marvel offices  Owsley  whom David describes as a  maverick   was impressed with how David had not previously hesitated to work with him when Owsley was an assistant editor under Larry Hama  and thus  when he became an editor  he purchased a Spider Man story from David  which appeared in Spectacular Spider Man  103 in 1985  2  Owsley subsequently purchased from David  The Death of Jean DeWolff   which ran in issues  107 110 of that title in 1985  Responding to charges of conflict of interest  David made a point of not discussing editorial matters with anyone during his 9 to 5 hours as Direct Sales Manager  42  and decided not to exploit his position as Sales Manager by promoting the title  37  Although David attributes the story s poor sales to this decision  such crossing over from Sales to Editorial  according to him  is now common  37  Nonetheless  he says he was fired from Spectacular Spider Man by Owsley due to editorial pressure by Marvel s Editor in Chief Jim Shooter  and has commented that the resentment stirred by Owsley s purchase of his stories may have permanently damaged Owsley s career  2  Months later  after Shooter was replaced by Bob Harras  Harras offered David The Incredible Hulk  as it was a struggling title that no one else wanted to write  37  42  During his run on Hulk  David explored the recurring themes of the Hulk s multiple personality disorder  his periodic changes between the more rageful and less intelligent Green Hulk and the more streetwise  cerebral Gray Hulk  and of being a journeyman hero  which were inspired by Incredible Hulk  312  October 1985   in which writer Bill Mantlo  and possibly  according to David  Barry Windsor Smith  had first established that Banner had suffered childhood abuse at the hands of his father  These aspects of the character would later be used in the 2003 feature film adaptation by screenwriter Michael France and director Ang Lee  40  43 Comic Book Resources credits David with making the formerly poor selling book  a must read mega hit   2  It was after he had been freelancing for a year  and into his run on Hulk  that David felt that his writing career had cemented  21  After putting out feelers at DC Comics  and being offered the job of writing a four issue miniseries of The Phantom by editor Mike Gold  David quit his sales position to write full time  44  David also took over Dreadstar during its First Comics run  with issue  41  March 1989  after Jim Starlin left the title  and remained on it until issue  64  March 1991   the final issue of that run  David s other Marvel Comics work in the late 1980s and 1990s includes runs on Wolverine  the New Universe series Merc and Justice  a run on the original X Factor  and the futuristic series Spider Man 2099  about a man in the year 2099 who takes up the mantle of Spider Man  the title character of which David co created  At DC Comics in 1990  David wrote a seven issue Aquaman miniseries  The Atlantis Chronicles  about the history of Aquaman s home of Atlantis  which David has referred to as among the written works of which he is most proud  45  He would later write a 1994 Aquaman miniseries  Aquaman  Time and Tide  which would lead to a relaunched monthly Aquaman series  the first 46 issues of which he would write from 1994 1998  His run on Aquaman gained notoriety  for in the book s second issue  Aquaman lost a hand  which was then replaced with a harpoon  a feature of the character that endured for the duration of David s run on the book  He also wrote the Star Trek comic book for DC from 1988 1991  when that company held the licensing rights to the property  though he has opined that novels are better suited to Star Trek  whose stories are not highly visual  2  He and Ron Marz cowrote the DC vs  Marvel intercompany crossover in 1996  46  David also enjoyed considerable runs on Supergirl 47  and Young Justice  the latter eventually being canceled so that DC could use that book s characters in a relaunched Teen Titans monthly  David s work for Dark Horse Comics has included the teen spy adventure  SpyBoy  which appeared in a series and a number of miniseries between 1999 and 2004  and the 2007 miniseries The Scream  Other series David worked on in the 1990s include the 1997 miniseries  Heroes Reborn  The Return  for Marvel  and two creator owned properties  Soulsearchers and Company  which is published by Claypool Comics  and the Epic Comics title Sachs and Violens  which he produced with co creator

for the first four volumes of the manga series Negima for Del Rey Manga  34  In 2003  David began writing another creator owned comic  Fallen Angel  for DC Comics  which he created in order to make use of plans he had devised for Supergirl after the  Many Happy Returns  storyline  but which were derailed by that series  cancellation  That same year  he also wrote a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series for Dreamwave that tied into the animated television series broadcast that year  2  DC canceled Fallen Angel after 20 issues  but David re started the title at IDW Publishing at the end of 2005

left after only 11 issues because of his workload  49  He also started a new series  Friendly Neighborhood Spider Man  beginning with a twelve part crossover storyline called  The Other   which  along with J  Michael Straczynski s run on Amazing Spider Man  and Reginald Hudlin s run on Marvel Knights Spider Man  depicted the webslinger as he discovered he was dying  lost an eye during a traumatic fight with Morlun  underwent a metamorphosis and emerged with new abilities and insights into his powers  As tends to be the case when fundamental changes are introduced to long standing classic comics characters  the storyline caused some controversy among readers for its introduction of retractable stingers in Spider Man s arms  and the establishment of a  totem  from which his powers are derived  50  David s final issue of that title was  23  51  David also wrote a MadroX miniseries that year  whose success led to a relaunch of a monthly X Factor  volume 3  written by him  This was a revamped version of the title starring both Madrox and other members of the former X Factor title that David had written in the early  90s  now working as investigators in a detective agency of that name  David s work on the title garnered praise from Ain t it Cool News  52  and David has stated that the opt in opt out policy and greater planning with which Marvel now executes crossover storylines has made his second stint on the title far easier  2  However  his decision to explicitly establish male characters Shatterstar and Rictor as sharing a homosexual attraction to one another  a confirmation of clues that had been established in X Force years earlier 53    drew criticism from Shatterstar s co creator  Rob Liefeld  54  though Editor in Chief Joe Quesada supported David s story  55  David would eventually win a 2011 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comic Book for his work on the title  56  57  58  On February 11  2006  David announced at the WonderCon convention in California in that he had signed an exclusive contract with Marvel Comics  Fallen Angel  Soulsearchers and Company and David s Spike miniseries were  grandfathered  into the contract  so as to not be affected by it  59  The first new project undertaken by David after entering into the contract  which he announced on April 5  2006  was writing the dialogue for The Dark Tower  The Gunslinger Born

screenplays  23  When writing novels  he sometimes outlines the story  and sometimes improvises it as he is writing it  78  David previously wrote his comic book scripts using the Marvel Method  but due to his tendency to overplot  as during his collaboration with Todd McFarlane on The Incredible Hulk  he switched to the full script method  79  which he continues to use as of 2003  21  He has stated that he prefers to plot his comics stories in six month arcs  5  He has also stated that when he works on a particular title  he always does so with a particular person or group of people in

first accept the job of writing that book  David has further explained that the events of his own life are sometimes reflected in his work  as when  for example  following the breakup of his first marriage  the direction of The Incredible Hulk faltered  with the Hulk wandering the world aimlessly  hopelessly looking to be loved  80  David has stated that his favorite female character of his own creation is Lee  the protagonist of Fallen Angel  which he says is derived from the positive female fan reaction to that character  81  Characters that David has not written but which he has expressed

than one occasion  editorial problems or corporate pressure to modify or re script his plotlines have prompted David to leave books  particularly his decision to terminate his first run on Marvel s X Factor  due to constantly having to constrain his plots to accommodate crossover events with other books  34  118  119  He also resigned from Spider Man 2099 to protest the firing of editor Joey Cavalieri  and from Aquaman over other creative differences  2  120  When David abruptly left his first stint on The Incredible Hulk due to editorial pressures  80  some of the plot points of the character that David established were retconned by later creative teams  34  In his  But I Digress  column  which has appeared in the Comics Buyer s Guide since July 27  1990  and in his blog  in operation since April 2002  121  122  David has been outspoken in many of his views pertaining to the comic book industry  and numerous other subjects  He has criticized the low regard in which writers are held  123  124  the practice of bagged comics  125  so called  poster covers  that showcase a character without indicating anything about the comic s content  the meaninglessness of killing off characters to be eventually revived  the poor commitment on the part of some to maintaining continuity in shared fictional universes  and the emphasis on gearing monthly comics series toward eventual collection into trade paperbacks  David has opined that failure on the part of consumers to purchase the monthly individual issues in favor of waiting for the trade collections hurts the sales of the monthly  and its chances of being collected at all  21  32  A father of four daughters  David has worked on a number of series that feature female leads  such as Supergirl  Fallen Angel and She Hulk  and has lamented that the American comic book market is not very supportive of such books  2  64  David has spoken out about fans who are abusive or threatening to creators  126  and against copyright infringement  127  particularly that committed through peer to peer file sharing and posting literary works in their entirety on the Internet without the permission of the copyright holder  128  On many occasions  he has offered criticisms of specific publishers  as when he criticized Wizard magazine for ageism  129  130  He has criticized companies for not sufficiently compensating the creators of their long standing and lucrative characters  such as Marvel Comics for its treatment of Blade creator Marv Wolfman 131  and Archie Comics for its treatment of Josie and the Pussycats creator Dan DeCarlo  132  133  He has also criticized publishers for various other business practices  134  including Marvel 135  and Image Comics  136  He has also defended said companies from criticism he feels is unfounded  as when he defended Marvel from a February 17  1992 Barron s magazine article  137  He has criticized deletionists on Wikipedia on more than one occasion  138  139  140  On occasion  he has also disagreed publicly with specific industry personalities such as Frank Miller 130  and Jim Shooter  141  Particularly publicized were his disagreements with Spawn creator Todd McFarlane in 1992 and 1993  in the wake of the formation of Image Comics  the company McFarlane co founded  This came to a head during a public debate they participated in at
