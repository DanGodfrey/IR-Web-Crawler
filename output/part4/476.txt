empire that existed from 962 to 1806 in Central Europe  It was ruled by the Holy Roman Emperor  Its character changed during the Middle Ages and the Early Modern period  when the power of the emperor gradually weakened in favour of the princes  In its last centuries  its character became quite close to a union of territories  The empire s territory was centered on the Kingdom of Germany  and included neighboring territories  which at its peak included the Kingdom of Italy and the Kingdom of Burgundy  For much of its history  the Empire consisted of hundreds of smaller sub units  principalities  duchies  counties  Free Imperial Cities and other domains  In 962 Otto I was crowned Holy Roman Emperor  German  R misch Deutscher Kaiser   although the Roman imperial title was first restored to Charlemagne in 800  Otto was the first emperor of the realm who was not a member of the earlier Carolingian dynasty  2  The last Holy Roman Emperor was Francis II  who abdicated and

Empire was used from 1157  under Frederick I Barbarossa   Holy Empire   the form  Holy Roman Empire  is attested from 1254 onward   5  The term was added to reflect Frederick s ambition to dominate Italy and the Papacy  6  Before 1157  the realm was merely referred to as the Roman Empire  4  In a decree following the 1512 Diet of Cologne  the name was officially changed to Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation  German  Heiliges R misches Reich Deutscher Nation  Latin  Imperium Romanum Sacrum Nationis Germanic    7  This form was first used in a document in 1474  6  The Holy Roman Empire was named after the Roman Empire and was considered its continuation  This is based in the medieval concept of translatio imperii  8  The French Enlightenment writer Voltaire remarked sardonically   This agglomeration which was called and which still calls itself the Holy Roman Empire was neither holy  nor Roman  nor an empire   9   edit  History  edit  Carolingian forerunners Further information  Carolingian Empire The Holy Roman Empire looked to Charlemagne  citation needed  King of the Franks  as its founder  who had been crowned Emperor of the Romans in 800 by Pope Leo III  10  11  The Western Roman Empire was thus revived  Latin  renovatio Romanorum imperii  by transferring it to the Frankish king  This translatio imperii remained the basis for the Holy Roman Empire  at least in theory  until its demise in 1806  The Carolingian imperial crown was initially disputed among the Carolingian rulers of Western Francia  France  and Eastern Francia  Germany   with first the western king  Charles the Bald  and then the eastern  Charles the Fat  attaining the prize  citation needed  However  after the death of Charles the Fat in 888 the Carolingian Empire broke asunder  never to be restored  According to Regino of Pr m  each part of the realm elected a  kinglet  from its own  bowels   citation needed  After the death of Charles the Fat those crowned Emperor by the Pope controlled only territories in Italy  citation needed  The last such Emperor was Berengar I of Italy who died in 924   edit  High Middle Ages Further information  Kingdom of Germany Evolution of the Holy Roman Empire  edit  Formation The Holy Roman Empire in 1000  Around 900  East Francia saw the reemergence of autonomous stem duchies  Franconia  Bavaria  Swabia  Saxony and Lotharingia   After the Carolingian king Louis the Child died without issue in 911  East Francia did not turn to the Carolingian ruler of West Francia to take over the realm but elected one of the dukes  Conrad of Franconia  as Rex Francorum Orientalum  citation needed  On his deathbed  Conrad yielded the crown to his main rival  Henry of Saxony  r  919 36   who was elected king at the Diet of Fritzlar in 919  citation needed  Henry reached a truce with the raiding Magyars and in 933 citation needed  won a first victory against them in the Battle of Riade  Henry died in 936 but his descendants  the Liudolfing  or Ottonian  dynasty  would continue to rule the Eastern kingdom for roughly a century  Henry s designated successor  Otto  was elected King in Aachen in 936  citation needed  He overcame a series of revolts both from an elder brother and from several dukes  After that  the king managed to control the appointment of dukes and often also employed bishops in administrative affairs  citation needed  The Kingdom had no permanent capital city citation needed  and the kings travelled from residence to residence  called Kaiserpfalz  to discharge affairs  However  each king preferred certain places  in Otto s case  the city of Magdeburg  Kingship continued to be transferred by election  but Kings often had their sons elected during their lifetime  enabling them to keep the crown for their families  This only changed after the end of the Salian dynasty in the 12th century  In 955  Otto won a decisive victory over the Magyars in the Battle of Lechfeld  citation needed  In 951  Otto came to the aid of Adelaide  citation needed  the widowed queen of Italy  defeating her enemies  He then married her and took control over Italy  citation needed  In 962  Otto was crowned Emperor by the Pope  citation needed  From then on  the affairs of the German kingdom were intertwined with that of Italy and the Papacy  Otto s coronation as Emperor made the German kings successors to the Empire of Charlemagne  which through translatio imperii also made them successors to Ancient Rome  This also renewed the conflict with the Eastern Emperor in Constantinople  especially after Otto s son Otto II  r  967 83  adopted the designation imperator Romanorum  Still  Otto formed marital ties with the east  when he married the Byzantine princess Theophanu  citation needed  Their son  Otto III  focused his attention on Italy and Rome and employed widespread diplomacy but died young in 1002  citation needed  to be succeeded by his cousin Henry II  who focused on Germany  When Henry II died in 1024  Conrad II  first of the Salian Dynasty  was then elected king in 1024 citation needed  only after some debate among dukes and nobles  which would eventually develop into the collegiate of Electors   edit  Investiture Controversy Kings often employed bishops in administrative affairs and often determined who would be appointed to ecclesiastical offices  citation needed  In the wake of the Cluniac Reforms  this involvement was increasingly seen as inappropriate by the Papacy  The reform minded Pope Gregory VII was determined to oppose such practices  leading to the Investiture Controversy with King Henry IV  r  1056 1106   citation needed  who repudiated the Pope s interference and persuaded his bishops to excommunicate the Pope  whom he famously addressed as  Hildebrand    Not Pope but false monk    citation needed  The Pope  in turn  excommunicated the king  declared him deposed and dissolved the oaths of loyalty made to Henry  citation needed  The king found himself with almost no political support and was forced to make the famous Walk to Canossa in 1077  citation needed  by which he achieved a lifting of the excommunication at the price of humiliation  Meanwhile  the German princes had elected another king  Rudolf of Swabia  citation needed  Henry managed to defeat him but was subsequently confronted with more uprisings  renewed excommunication and even the rebellion of his sons  It was his second son  Henry V  who managed to reach an agreement with both the Pope and the bishops in the 1122 Concordat of Worms  citation needed  The political power of the Empire was maintained but the conflict had demonstrated the limits of any ruler s power  especially in regard to the Church  and robbed the king of the sacral status he had previously enjoyed  Both the Pope and the German princes had surfaced as major players in the political system of the Empire   edit  Hohenstaufen dynasty Adhemar de Monteil carries the Holy Lance  When the Salian dynasty ended with Henry V s death in 1125  the princes chose not to elect the next of kin  but rather Lothair  the moderately powerful but already old Duke of Saxony  When he died in 1138  the princes again aimed at checking royal power  accordingly they did not elect Lothair s favoured heir  his son in law Henry the Proud of the Welf family  but Conrad III of the Hohenstaufen family  close relatives of the Salians  leading to over a century of strife between the two houses  Conrad ousted the Welfs from the possessions  but after his death in 1152  his nephew Frederick I  Barbarossa  succeeded and made peace with the Welfs  restoring his cousin Henry the Lion to his albeit diminished possessions  The Hohenstaufen rulers increasingly lent land to ministerialia  formerly non free service men  which Frederick hoped would be more reliable than dukes  Initially used mainly for war services  this new class of people would form the basis for the later knights  another basis of imperial power  Another important constitutional move at Roncaglia was the establishment of a new peace  Landfrieden  for all of the Empire  an attempt to  on the one hand  abolish private feuds not only between the many dukes  but on the other hand a means to tie the Emperor s subordinates to a legal system of jurisdiction and public prosecution of criminal acts   a predecessor of the modern concept of  rule of law   Another new concept of the time was the systematic foundation of new cities  both by the Emperor and the local dukes  These were partly caused by the explosion in population  but also to concentrate economic power at strategic locations  while formerly cities only existed in the shape of either old Roman foundations or older bishoprics  Cities that were founded in the 12th century include Freiburg  possibly the economic model for many later cities  and Munich  Frederick was crowned Emperor in 1155 and emphasised the Empire s  Romanness   partly in an attempt to justify the Emperor s power independently of the  now strengthened  Pope  An imperial assembly at the fields of Roncaglia in 1158 reclaimed imperial rights in reference to Justinian s Corpus Juris Civilis  Imperial rights had been referred to as regalia since the Investiture Controversy  but were enumerated for the first time at Roncaglia as well  This comprehensive list included public roads  tariffs  coining  collecting punitive fees and the investiture  the seating and unseating of office holders  These rights were now explicitly rooted in Roman Law  a far reaching constitutional act  Frederick s policies were mainly aimed at Italy  where he clashed with the increasingly wealthy and free minded cities of the north  especially Milan  He also embroiled himself in another conflict with the Papacy by supporting a candidate elected by a minority against Pope Alexander III  1159 81   Frederick supported a succession of antipopes before finally making peace with Alexander in 1177  In Germany  the Emperor had repeatedly protected Henry the Lion against complaints by rival princes or cities  especially in the cases of Munich and L beck   Henry s support of Frederick s policies was only lackluster and in a critical situation during the Italian wars  Henry refused the Emperor s plea for military support  After his return to Germany  an embittered Frederick opened proceedings against the Duke  resulting in a public ban and the confiscation of all territories  During the Hohenstaufen period  German princes facilitated a successful  peaceful eastward settlement of lands previously sparsely inhabited by West Slavs or uninhabited  by German speaking farmers  traders and craftsmen from the western part of the Empire  both Christians and Jews  The gradual Germanization of these lands was a complex phenomenon which should not be interpreted in terms of 19th century nationalism s bias  By the eastward settlement the Empire s influence increased to eventually include Pomerania and Silesia   also due to intermarriage of the local  still mostly Slavic  rulers with German spouses  Also  the Teutonic Knights were invited to Prussia by Duke Konrad of Masovia to Christianise the Prussians in 1226  The monastic state of the Teutonic Order  German  Deutschordensstaat  and its later German successor states of Prussia however never were part of the Holy Roman Empire  In 1190  Barbarossa participated in the Third Crusade and died in Asia Minor  Under his son and successor  Henry VI  the Hohenstaufen dynasty reached its apex  Henry added the Norman kingdom of Sicily to his domains  held English king Richard the Lionheart captive and aimed to establishing a hereditary monarchy  when he died in 1197  As his son  Frederick II  though already elected king  was still a small child and living in Sicily  German princes chose to elect an adult king  which resulted in the dual election of Barbarossa s youngest son Philip of Swabia and Henry the Lion s son Otto of Brunswick  who competed for the crown  Otto prevailed for a while after Philip was murdered in a private squabble in 1208 until he began to also claim Sicily  Pope Innocent III  who feared the threat posed by a union of the Empire and Sicily  now supported Sicily s king Frederick II  who marched to Germany and defeated Otto  After his victory  Frederick did not act upon his promise to keep the two realms separate   though he had made his son Henry king of Sicily before marching on Germany  he still reserved real political power for himself  This continued after Frederick was crowned Emperor in 1220  Fearing Frederick s concentration of power  the Pope finally excommunicated the Emperor  Another point was the crusade  which Frederick had promised but repeatedly postponed  Now  though excommunicated  Frederick led the crusade in 1228  which however ended in negotiations and a temporary restoration of the Kingdom of Jerusalem  The conflict with the Pope endured who later supported the election of an anti king in Germany  Despite his imperial claims  Frederick s rule was a major turning point towards the disintegration of a central rule in the Empire  While concentrated on establishing a modern  centralised state in Sicily  he was mostly absent from Germany and issued far reaching privileges to Germany s secular and ecclesiastical princes  In the 1220 Confoederatio cum principibus ecclesiasticis  Frederick gave up a number of regalia in favour of the bishops  among them tariffs  coining  and fortification  The 1232 Statutum in favorem principum mostly extended these privileges to secular territories  Although many of these privileges had existed earlier  they were now granted globally  and once and for all  to allow the German princes to maintain order north of the Alps while Frederick wanted to concentrate on Italy  The 1232 document marked the first time that the German dukes were called domini terr   owners of their lands  a remarkable change in terminology as well   edit  Interregnum The Reichssturmfahne  in use as military banner during the 13th and early 14th centuries  After the death of Frederick II in 1250  the German kingdom was divided among his son Conrad IV  died 1254  and the anti king  William of Holland  died 1256   Conrad s death was followed by the Interregnum  during which no king could achieve universal recognition and the princes managed to consolidate their holdings and became even more independent rulers  After 1257  the crown was contested between Richard of Cornwall  who was supported by the Guelph party  and Alfonso X of Castile  who was recognised by the Hohenstaufen party but never set foot on German soil  After Richard s death in 1273  the Interregnum ended with unanimous election of Rudolph I of Habsburg  a minor pro Staufen count   edit  Changes in political structure Further information  Medieval commune  St dtebund  Hanseatic League  and Reichsfreiheit The 7 Prince electors  The 13th century also saw a general structural change in how land was administered  preparing the shift of political power towards the rising bourgeoisie at the expense of aristocratic feudalism that would characterize the Late Middle Ages  Instead of personal duties  money increasingly became the common means to represent economic value in agriculture  Peasants were increasingly required to pay tribute for their lands  The concept of  property  began to replace more ancient forms of jurisdiction  although they were still very much tied together  In the territories  not at the level of the Empire   power became increasingly bundled  Whoever owned the land had jurisdiction  from which other powers derived  It is important to note  however  that jurisdiction at this time did not include legislation  which virtually did not exist until well into the 15th century  Court practice heavily relied on traditional customs or rules described as customary  It is during this time that the territories began to transform themselves into predecessors of modern states  The process varied greatly among the various lands and was most advanced in those territories that were most identical to the lands of the old Germanic tribes  e g  Bavaria  It was slower in those scattered territories that were founded through imperial privileges   edit  Late Middle Ages Further information  Late Middle Ages and Pomerania during the Late Middle Ages  edit  Rise of the territories after the Hohenstaufen Holy Roman Empire from 1273 1378  and its principal royal dynasties The difficulties in electing the king eventually led to the emergence of a fixed college of Prince electors  Kurf rsten   whose composition and procedures were set forth in the Golden Bull of 1356  This development probably best symbolises the emerging duality between emperor and realm  Kaiser und Reich   which were no longer considered identical  This is also revealed in the way the post Hohenstaufen kings attempted to sustain their power  Earlier  the Empire s strength  and finances  greatly relied on the Empire s own lands  the so called Reichsgut  which always belonged to the king of the day and included many Imperial Cities  After the 13th century  the relevance of the Reichsgut faded  even though some parts of it did remain until the Empire s end in 1806  Instead  the Reichsgut was increasingly pawned to local dukes  sometimes to raise money for the Empire  but more frequently to reward faithful duty or as an attempt to establish control over the dukes  The direct governance of the Reichsgut no longer matched the needs of either the king or the dukes  Instead  the kings  beginning with Rudolph I of Habsburg  increasingly relied on the lands of their respective dynasties to support their power  In contrast with the Reichsgut  which was mostly scattered and difficult to administer  these territories were relatively compact and thus easier to control  In 1282  Rudolph I thus lent Austria and Styria to his own sons  With Henry VII  the House of Luxembourg entered the stage  In 1312  Henry was crowned as the first Holy Roman Emperor since Frederick II  After him all kings and emperors relied on the lands of their own family  Hausmacht   Louis IV of Wittelsbach  king 1314  emperor 1328 47  relied on his lands in Bavaria  Charles IV of Luxembourg  the grandson of Henry VII  drew strength from his own lands in Bohemia  Interestingly  it was thus increasingly in the king s own interest to strengthen the power of the territories  since the king profited from such a benefit in his own lands as well   edit  Imperial reform Further information  Vehmic court Map of the Empire showing division into Circles in 1512 The  constitution  of the Empire was still largely unsettled at the beginning of the 15th century  Although some procedures and institutions had been fixed  for example by the Golden Bull of 1356  the rules of how the king  the electors  and the other dukes should cooperate in the Empire much depended on the personality of the respective king  It therefore proved somewhat damaging that Sigismund of Luxemburg  king 1410  emperor 1433 37  and Frederick III of Habsburg  king 1440  emperor 1452 93  neglected the old core lands of the empire and mostly resided in their own lands  Without the presence of the king  the old institution of the Hoftag  the assembly of the realm s leading men  deteriorated  The Imperial Diet as a legislative organ of the Empire did not exist at that time  Even worse  dukes often went into feuds against each other that  more often than not  escalated into local wars  Simultaneously  the Church was in a state of crisis too  with wide reaching effects in the Empire  The conflict between several papal claimants  two anti popes and the legitimate Pope  was only resolved at the Council of Constance  1414 18   after 1419  much energy was spent on fighting the Hussites  The medieval idea of unifying all Christendom into a single political entity  of which the Church and the Empire were the leading institutions  began to decline  With these drastic changes  much discussion emerged in the 15th century about the Empire itself  Rules from the past no longer adequately described the structure of the time  and a reinforcement of earlier Landfrieden was urgently called for  During this time  the concept of  reform  emerged  in the original sense of the Latin verb re formare  to regain an earlier shape that had been lost  When Frederick III needed the dukes to finance war against Hungary in 1486 and at the same time had his son  later Maximilian I elected king  he was presented with the dukes  united demand to participate in an Imperial Court  For the first time  the assembly of the electors and other dukes was now called the Imperial Diet  German Reichstag   to be joined by the Imperial Free Cities later   While Frederick refused  his more conciliatory son finally convened the Diet at Worms in 1495  after his father s death in 1493  Here  the king and the dukes agreed on four bills  commonly referred to as the Reichsreform  Imperial Reform   a set of legal acts to give the disintegrating Empire back some structure  Among others  this act produced the Imperial Circle Estates and the Reichskammergericht  Imperial Chamber Court   structures that would to a degree persist until the end of the Empire in 1806  However  it took a few more decades until the new regulation was universally accepted and the new court actually began to function  only in 1512 would the Imperial Circles be finalised  The King also made sure that his own court  the Reichshofrat  continued to function in parallel to the Reichskammergericht  In this year  the Empire also received its new title  the Heiliges R misches Reich Deutscher Nation   Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation     edit  Reformation and Renaissance Further information  German Reformation and German Renaissance See also  Charles V  Holy Roman Emperor In 1516  Ferdinand II of Aragon  grandfather of the future Holy Roman Emperor Charles V  died  Due to a combination of  1  the traditions of dynastic succession in Aragon  which permitted maternal inheritance with no precedence for female rule   2  the insanity of Charles s mother  Joanna of Castile  and  3  the insistence by his remaining grandfather  Maximilian I  that he take up his royal titles  Charles initiated his reign in Castile and Aragon  a union which evolved into Spain  in conjunction with his mother  This ensured for the first time that all the realms of the Iberian peninsula  save for Portugal  would be united by one monarch under one nascent Spanish crown  with the founding territories retaining their separate governance codes and laws  In 1519  already reigning as Carlos I in Spain  Charles took up the imperial title as Karl V  The balance  and imbalance  between these separate inheritances would be defining elements of his reign  and would ensure that personal union between the Spanish and German crowns would be short lived  The latter would end up going to a more junior branch of the Habsburgs in the person of Charles s brother Ferdinand  while the senior branch continued rule in Spain and in the Burgundian inheritance in the person of Charles s son  Philip II of Spain  In addition to conflicts between his Spanish and German inheritances  conflicts of religion would be another source of tension during the reign of Charles V  Before Charles even began his reign in the Holy Roman Empire  in 1517  Martin Luther initiated what would later be known as the Reformation  At this time  many local dukes saw it as a chance to oppose the hegemony of Emperor Charles V  The empire then became fatally divided along religious lines  with the north  the east  and many of the major cities Strasbourg  Frankfurt and Nuremberg becoming Protestant while the southern and western regions largely remained Catholic  Carta itineraria europae  by Waldseem ller  1520 dedicated to Emperor Charles V   From 1515 to 1523  the Habsburg government in the Netherlands also had to contend with the Frisian peasant rebellion  led first by Pier Gerlofs Donia and then by his nephew Wijerd Jelckama  The rebels were initially successful  but after a series of defeats  the remaining leaders were taken and decapitated in 1523  This was a blow for the Holy Roman Empire since many major cities were sacked and as many as 132 ships sunk  once even 28 in a single battle    edit  Baroque period Main articles  Early Modern history of Germany and Pomerania during the Early Modern Age Further information  Baroque period  Protestant Union  Catholic League  German   and Thirty Years War Charles V continued to battle the French and the Protestant princes in Germany for much of his reign  After his son Philip married Queen Mary of England  it appeared that France would be completely surrounded by Habsburg domains  but this hope proved unfounded when the marriage produced no children  In 1555  Paul IV was elected pope and took the side of France  whereupon an exhausted Charles finally gave up his hopes of a world Christian empire  He abdicated and divided his territories between Philip and Ferdinand of Austria  The Peace of Augsburg ended the war in Germany and accepted the existence of the Protestant princes  although not Calvinism  Anabaptism  or Zwingliism  Germany would enjoy relative peace for the next six decades  On the eastern front  the Turks continued to loom large as a threat  although war would mean further compromises with the Protestant princes  and so the Emperor sought to avoid that  In the west  the Rhineland increasingly fell under French influence  After the Dutch revolt against Spain erupted  the Empire remained neutral  A side effect was the Cologne War  which ravaged much of the upper Rhine  After Ferdinand died in 1564  his son Maximilian II became Emperor  and like his father  accepted the existence of Protestantism and the need for occasional compromise with it  Maximilian was succeeded in 1576 by Rudolf II  a strange man who preferred classical Greek philosophy to Christianity and lived an isolated existence in Bohemia  He became afraid to act when the Catholic Church was forcibly reasserting control in Austria and Hungary and the Protestant princes became upset over this  Imperial power sharply deteriorated by the time of Rudolf s death in 1612  When Bohemians rebelled against the Emperor  the immediate result was the series of conflicts known as the Thirty Years  War  1618 48   which devastated the Empire  Foreign powers  including France and Sweden  intervened in the conflict and strengthened those fighting Imperial power  but also seized considerable territory for themselves  The long conflict so bled the Empire that it never recovered its strength  At the Battle of Vienna  1683   the Army of the Holy Roman Empire  led by the Polish King John III Sobieski  decisively defeated a large Turkish army  ending the western colonial Ottoman advance and leading to the eventual dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire in Europe  The HRE army was half Polish Lithuanian

Netherlands  left the Empire  Although its constituent states still had some restrictions in particular  they could not form alliances against the Emperor   the Empire from this point was a powerless

German Mediatisation was the series of mediatisations and secularisations that occurred in 1795 1814  during the latter part of the era of the French Revolution and then the Napoleonic Era  Mediatisation was the process of annexing the lands of one sovereign monarchy to another  often leaving the annexed some rights  Secularisation was the redistribution to secular states of the secular lands held by an ecclesiastical ruler such as a bishop or an abbot  The Empire was formally dissolved on 6 August 1806 when the last Holy Roman Emperor Francis II  from 1804  Emperor Francis I of Austria  abdicated  following a military defeat by the French under Napoleon  see Treaty of Pressburg   Napoleon reorganized much of the Empire into the Confederation of the Rhine  a French satellite  Francis  House of Habsburg Lorraine survived the demise of the Empire  continuing to reign as Emperors of Austria and Kings of Hungary until the Habsburg empire s final dissolution in 1918 in the aftermath of World War I  The Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine was replaced by a new union  the German Confederation  in 1815  following the end of the Napoleonic Wars  It lasted until 1866 when Prussia founded the North German Confederation  a forerunner of the German Empire which united the German speaking territories outside of Austria and Switzerland under Prussian leadership in 1871  This later served as the predecessor state of modern Germany   edit  Institutions The Holy Roman Empire was not a highly centralized state like most countries today  Instead  it was divided into dozens eventually hundreds of individual entities governed by kings  12 dukes  counts  bishops  abbots and other rulers  collectively known as princes  There were also some areas ruled directly by the Emperor  At no time could the Emperor simply issue decrees and govern autonomously over the Empire  His power was severely restricted by the various local leaders  From the High Middle Ages onwards  the Holy Roman Empire was marked by an uneasy coexistence of the princes of the local territories who were struggling to take power away from it  To a greater extent than in other medieval kingdoms such as France and England  the Emperors were unable to gain much control over the lands that they formally owned  Instead  to secure their own position from the threat of being deposed  Emperors were forced to grant more and more autonomy to local rulers  both nobles and bishops  This process began in the 11th century with the Investiture Controversy and was more or less concluded with the 1648 Peace of Westphalia  Several Emperors attempted to reverse this steady dissemination of their authority  but were thwarted both by the papacy and by the princes of the Empire   edit  Imperial estates Main article  Imperial State The number of territories in the Empire was considerable  rising to approximately 300 at the time of the Peace of Westphalia  Many of these Kleinstaaten   little states   covered no more than a few square miles  or included several non contiguous pieces  so the Empire was often called a Flickenteppich   patchwork carpet    An entity was considered a Reichsstand  imperial estate  if  according to feudal law  it had no authority above it except the Holy Roman Emperor himself  The imperial estates comprised  Territories ruled by a hereditary nobleman  such as a prince  archduke  duke  or count  Territories in which secular authority was held by a clerical dignitary  such as an archbishop  bishop  or abbot  Such a cleric was a prince of the church  In the common case of a prince bishop  this temporal territory  called a prince bishopric  frequently overlapped with his often larger ecclesiastical diocese  giving the bishop both civil and clerical powers  Examples include the three prince archbishoprics  Cologne  Trier  and Mainz  Free imperial cities  which were subject only to the jurisdiction of the emperor  For a list of Reichsst nde in 1792  see

Portal v t e The crown of the Holy Roman Empire  2nd half of the 10th century   now held in the Schatzkammer  Vienna  A prospective Emperor had first to be elected King of the Romans  Latin  Rex romanorum  German  r mischer K nig   German kings had been elected since the 9th century  at that point they were chosen by the leaders of the five most important tribes  the Salian Franks of Lorraine  Ripuarian Franks of Franconia  Saxons  Bavarians and Swabians   In the Holy Roman Empire  the main dukes and bishops of the kingdom elected the King of the Romans  In 1356  Emperor Charles IV issued the Golden Bull  which limited the electors to seven  the Count Palatine of the Rhine  the King of Bohemia  the Duke of Saxony  the Margrave of Brandenburg and the archbishops of Cologne  Mainz  and Trier  During the Thirty Years  War  the Duke of Bavaria was given the right to vote as the eighth elector  A candidate for election would be expected to offer concessions of land or money to the electors in order to secure their vote  After being elected  the King of the Romans could theoretically claim the title of  Emperor  only after being crowned by the Pope  In many cases  this took several years while the King was held up by other tasks  frequently he first had to resolve conflicts in rebellious northern Italy  or was in quarrel with the Pope himself  Later Emperors dispensed with the papal coronation altogether  being content with the styling Emperor Elect  the last Emperor to be crowned by the Pope was Charles V in 1530  The Emperor had to be a man of good character over 18 years  All four of his grandparents were expected to be of noble blood  No law required him to be a Catholic  though imperial law assumed that he was  He did not need to be a German  neither Alfonso X of Castile nor Richard of Cornwall  who contested for the crown in the 13th century  were themselves German   By the 17th century candidates generally possessed estates within the Empire   edit  Imperial Diet  Reichstag  Main article  Imperial Diet  Holy Roman Empire  The Imperial Diet  Reichstag  or Reichsversammlung  was the legislative body of the Holy Roman Empire and theoretically superior to the emperor himself  It was divided into three classes  The first class  the Council of Electors  consisted of the electors  or the princes who could vote for King of the Romans  The second class  the Council of Princes  consisted of the other princes  The Council of Princes was divided into two  benches   one for secular rulers and one for ecclesiastical ones  Higher ranking princes had individual votes  while lower ranking princes were grouped into  colleges  by geography  Each college had one vote  The third class was the Council of Imperial Cities  which was divided into two colleges  Swabia and the Rhine  The Council of Imperial Cities was not fully happy with the others  it could not vote on several matters such as the admission of new territories  The representation of the Free Cities at the Diet had become common since the late Middle Ages  Nevertheless  their participation was formally acknowledged only as late as in 1648 with the Peace of Westphalia ending the Thirty Years  War   edit  Imperial courts The Empire also had two courts  the Reichshofrat  also known in English as the Aulic Council  at the court of the King Emperor  and the Reichskammergericht  Imperial Chamber Court   established with the Imperial Reform of 1495   edit  Imperial circles As part of the Imperial Reform  six Imperial Circles were established in 1500  four more were established in 1512  These were regional groupings of most  though not all  of the various states of the Empire for the purposes of defence  imperial taxation  supervision of coining  peace keeping functions and public security  Each circle had its own parliament  known as a Kreistag   Circle Diet    and one or more directors  who coordinated the affairs of the circle  Not all imperial territories were included within the imperial circles  even after 1512  the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were excluded  as were Switzerland  the imperial fiefs in northern Italy  the lands of the Imperial Knights  and certain other small territories like the Lordship of Jever   edit  See also Part of a series on Medieval History By region Medieval Armenia Medieval Bosnia Medieval England
