assistant asked if he could film Wahlberg and his friends  calling them  hilarious   3  Other reports credit Eric Weinstein  a long time friend of Wahlberg s  with the idea of filming the actor s group of friends  4  5  In order to be more satirical of the Hollywood lifestyle  a fictional approach was chosen rather than a straight documentary in order to keep the content light  and avoid directly depicting Wahlberg s violent past  4  Vincent Chase was envisioned to be more similar to Wahlberg  but it was decided that some of his and his friends  activities  particularly some elements of their criminal past  would not work well on television  3  A lighter approach was subsequently decided upon  3  However  according to Donnie Carroll  who was the inspiration for the Turtle character  the idea for a show involving an actor and his friends had come from him  6  It had originated as a book idea  centered on Carroll s own life and his experiences with Wahlberg  titled From the  Hood to Hollywood  A Soldier s Story  6   edit  Cast and characters The main characters of Entourage  From left to right  Ari Gold  Jeremy Piven   Eric  E  Murphy  Kevin Connolly   Vincent  Vince
