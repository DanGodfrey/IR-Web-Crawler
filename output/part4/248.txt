Conscription From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search  Conscript  redirects here  For other uses  see Conscript  disambiguation     No armed forces   No enforced conscription   Plan to abolish conscription in the near future   Conscription   No information Conscription is the compulsory enlistment of people in some sort of national service  most often military service  1  Conscription dates back to antiquity and continues in some countries to the present day under various names  The modern system of near universal national conscription for young men dates to the French Revolution in the 1790s  where it became the basis of a very large and powerful military  Most European nations later copied the system in peacetime  so that men at a certain age would serve 1 3 years on active duty  then transfer to the reserve force  In China  the State of Qin instituted universal military service following the registration of every household  2  This allowed huge armies to be levied  and was instrumental in the creation of the Qin Empire that conquered the whole of China in 221BC  Conscription is controversial  because of conscientious objection to service  or political objection to service for a disliked government  or an unpopular war  and because it violates individual rights  Those conscripted may evade service  sometimes by leaving the country  3  Some selection systems accommodate these attitudes by providing alternative service outside combat operations roles or even outside the military  such as Zivildienst in Austria and Switzerland  As of the early 21st century  many states no longer conscript soldiers  relying instead upon professional militaries with volunteers enlisted to meet the demand for troops  The ability to rely on such an arrangement  however  presupposes some degree of predictability with regard to both war fighting requirements and the scope of hostilities  Many states that have abolished conscription therefore still reserve the power to resume it during wartime or times of crisis  4  In the United States  conscription  also called  the draft   ended in 1973  but males between 18 and 25 are required to register with the Selective Service System to enable a reintroduction of conscription if necessary  Contents 1 History 1 1 Ilkum 1 2 China 1 3 Medieval levies 1 4 Military slavery 1 5 Invention of modern conscription 1

BCE   the Babylonian Empire used a system of conscription called Ilkum  Under the system those eligible were required to serve in the royal army in time of war  5  During times of peace they were instead required to provide labour for other activities of the state  5  In return for this service  those subject to it gained the right to hold land  5  It is possible that this right was not to hold land per se but specific land supplied by the state  5  Various forms of avoiding military service are recorded  While it was outlawed by the Code of Hammurabi  the hiring of substitutes appears to have been practiced both before and after the creation of the code  6  Later records show that Ilkum commitments could become regularly traded  6  In other places  people simply left their towns to avoid their Ilkum service  6  Another option was to sell Ilkum lands and the commitments along with them  With the exception of a few exempted classes  this was forbidden by the Code of Hammurabi  6   edit  China Universal conscription in China dates back to the State of Qin  which eventually became the Qin Empire of 221BC  Following unification  historical records show that a total of 300 000 conscript soldiers and 500 000 conscript labourers constructed the Great Wall of China 7  In the following dynasties  universal conscription was abolished and reintroduced on numerous occasions  As of 2011 update   universal military conscription is theoretically mandatory in the People s Republic of China  and reinforced by law  However  due to the large population of China and large pool of candidates available for recruitment  the People s Liberation Army has always had sufficient volunteers  so conscription has not been required in practice at all  citation needed   edit  Medieval levies This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   July 2010  Under the feudal conditions for holding land in the medieval period  most peasants and freemen were liable to provide one man of suitable age per family for military duty when required by either the king or the local lord  The levies raised in this way fought as infantry under local superiors  Although the exact laws varied greatly depending on the country and the period  generally these levies were only obliged to fight for one to three months  Most were subsistence farmers  and it was in everyone s interest to send the men home for harvest time  In medieval Scandinavia the  lei angr   Old Norse    leidang   Norwegian    leding    Danish    ledung   Swedish    lichting   Dutch    expeditio   Latin  or sometimes  le ing   Old English   was a levy of free farmers conscripted into coastal fleets for seasonal excursions and in defence of the realm  The bulk of the Anglo Saxon English army  called the fyrd  was composed of part time English soldiers drawn from the landowning minor nobility  These thegns were the land holding aristocracy of the time and were required to serve with their own armour and weapons for a certain number of days each year  The historian David Sturdy has cautioned about regarding the fyrd as a precursor to a modern national army composed of all ranks of society  describing it as a  ridiculous fantasy   The persistent old belief that peasants and small farmers gathered to form a national army or fyrd is a strange delusion dreamt up by antiquarians in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries to justify universal military conscription  8   edit  Military slavery The system of military slaves was widely used in the Middle East  beginning with the Egyptians training Mamluks from the 9th century  to the Turks and Ottoman Empire through the 19th century  In the middle of the 14th century  Ottoman Sultan Murad I developed personal troops to be loyal to him  with a slave army called the Kap kulu  The new force was built by taking Christian children from newly conquered lands  especially from the far areas of his empire  in a system known as the dev irme  translated  gathering  or  converting    The captive children were persuaded to convert to Islam  The Sultans had the young boys trained over several years  Those who showed special promise in fighting skills were trained in advanced warrior skills  put into the sultan s personal service  and turned into the Janissaries  the elite branch of the Kap kulu  A number of distinguished military commanders of the Ottomans  and most of the imperial administrators and upper level officials of the Empire  such as Pargal   brahim Pasha and Sokollu Mehmet Pa a  were recruited in this way  9  By 1609 the Sultan s Kap kulu forces increased to about 100 000  10  In later years  Sultans turned to the Barbary Pirates to supply their Jannissaries corps  Their attacks on ships off the coast of Africa or in the Mediterranean  and subsequent capture of able bodied men for ransom or sale provided some captives for the Sultan s system  Starting in the 17th century  Christian families living under the Ottoman rule began to submit their sons into the Kapikulu system willingly  as they saw this as a potentially invaluable career opportunity for their children  Eventually the Sultan turned to foreign volunteers from the warrior clans of Circassians in southern Russia to fill his Janissary armies  As a whole the system began to break down  the loyalty of the Jannissaries became increasingly suspect  Mahmud II forcibly disbanded the Janissary corps in 1826  11  12  Similar to the Janissaries in origin and means of development were the Mamluks of Egypt in the Middle Ages  The Mamluks were usually captive non Muslim Iranian and Turkish children who had been kidnapped or bought as slaves from the Barbary coasts  The Egyptians assimilated and trained the boys and young men to become Islamic soldiers who served the Muslim caliphs and the Ayyubid sultans during the Middle Ages  The first mamluks served the Abbasid caliphs in 9th century Baghdad  Over time they became a powerful military caste  On more than one occasion  they seized power  for example  ruling Egypt from 1250 1517  From 1250 Egypt had been ruled by the Bahri dynasty of Kipchak origin  Slaves from the Caucasus served in the army and formed an elite corp of troops  They eventually revolted in Egypt to form the Burgi dynasty  The Mamluks  excellent fighting abilities  massed Islamic armies  and overwhelming numbers succeeded in overcoming the Christian Crusader fortresses in the Holy Land  The Mamluks were the most successful defense against the Mongol Ilkhanate of Persia and Iraq from entering Egypt  13  On the western coast of Africa  Berber Muslims captured non Muslims to put to work as laborers  They generally converted the younger people to Islam and many became quite assimilated  In Morocco  the Berber looked south rather than north  The Moroccan Sultan Moulay Ismail  called  the Bloodthirsty   1672 1727   employed a corps of 150 000 black slaves  called his Black Guard  He used them to coerce the country into submission  14   edit  Invention of modern conscription Modern conscription  the massed military enlistment of national citizens  was devised during the French Revolution  to enable the Republic to defend itself from the attacks of European monarchies  Deputy Jean Baptiste Jourdan gave its name to the 5 September 1798 Act  whose first article stated   Any Frenchman is a soldier and owes himself to the defense of the nation   It enabled the creation of the Grande Arm e  what Napoleon Bonaparte called  the nation in arms   which overwhelmed European professional armies that often numbered only into the low tens of thousands  More than 2 6 million men were inducted into the French military in this way between the years 1800 and 1813  15  The defeat of the Prussian Army in particular shocked the Prussian establishment  which had believed it was invincible after the victories of Frederick the Great  The Prussians were used to relying on superior organization and tactical factors such as order of battle to focus superior troops against inferior ones  Given approximately equivalent forces  as was generally the case with professional armies  these factors showed considerable importance  However  they became considerably less important when the Prussian armies faced forces that outnumbered their own in some cases by more than ten to one  Scharnhorst advocated adopting the lev e en masse  the military conscription used by France  The Kr mpersystem was the beginning of short term compulsory service in Prussia  as opposed to the long term conscription previously used  16  In the Russian Empire  the military service time  owed  by serfs was 25 years at the beginning of the 19th century  In 1834 it was decreased to 20 years  The recruits were to be not younger than 17 and not older than 35  17  In 1874 Russia introduced universal conscription in the modern pattern  an innovation only made possible by the abolition of serfdom in 1861  New military law decreed that all male Russian subjects  when they reached the age of 20  were eligible to serve in the military for six years  18   edit  World Wars The range of eligible ages for conscripting was expanded to meet national demand during the World Wars  In the United States  the Selective Service System drafted men for World War I initially in an age range from 21 to 30 but expanded its eligibility in 1918 to an age range of 18 to 45  19  In the case of a widespread mobilization of forces where service includes homefront defense  ages of conscripts may range much higher  with the oldest conscripts serving in roles requiring lesser mobility  Expanded age conscription was common during the Second World War  in Britain  it was commonly known as  call up  and extended to age 51  Nazi Germany termed it Volkssturm   People s Storm   and included men as young as 16 and as old as 60  20  During the Second World War  both Britain and the Soviet Union conscripted women  The United States was on the verge of drafting women into the Nurse Corps because it anticipated it would need the extra personnel for its planned invasion of Japan  However the Japanese surrendered and the idea was abandoned  21   edit  The Netherlands Main article  Conscription in the Netherlands Conscription  which was called  Service Duty  Dutch  dienstplicht  in the Netherlands  was first employed in 1810 by French occupying forces  Napoleon s brother Louis Bonaparte  who was King of Holland from 1806 to 1810  had tried to introduce conscription a few years earlier  unsuccessfully  Every man aged 20 years or older had to enlist  By means of drawing lots it was decided who had to undertake service in the French army  It was possible to arrange a substitute against payment  Later on  conscription was used for all men over the age of 18  Postponement was possible  due to study  for example  Conscientious objectors could perform an alternative civilian service instead of military service  For various reasons  this forced military service was criticized at the end of the twentieth century  Since the Cold War was over  so was the direct threat of a war  Instead  the Dutch army was employed in more and more peacekeeping operations  The complexity and danger of these missions made the use of conscripts controversial  Furthermore the conscription system was thought to be unfair as only men were drafted  In the European part of Netherlands  compulsory attendance has been officially suspended since 1 May 1997  Between 1991 and 1996  the Dutch armed forces phased out their conscript personnel and converted to an all volunteer force  The last conscript troops were inducted in 1995 and demobilized in 1996  The suspension means that citizens are no longer forced to serve in the armed forces  as long as it is not required for the safety of the country  Since then  the Dutch army is an all volunteer force  However  to this day every male citizen aged 17 gets a letter in which he is told that he has been registered  but he does not have to present himself for service  The Dutch army allowed its male soldiers to have long hair from the early 1970s to the end of conscription in the mid 1990s  Even though it is generally thought that conscription has been abolished in the Netherlands  this perception is  in fact  incorrect  The compulsory attendance was abolished  not the conscription  The laws and systems which provide for the conscription of armed forces personnel still remain in place  In Cura ao and Aruba  conscription is still in existence   edit  Britain Main article  Conscription in the United Kingdom Britain introduced conscription for the first time in 1916  halfway through World War I  and abolished it in 1920  and reintroduced it again in 1939 on the outbreak of World War II  It remained in force until 1960  In all  8 000 000 men were drafted  as well as several hundred thousand women  22  The introduction of conscription in May 1939  before the war began  was largely due to pressure from the French  who emphasized the need for a large British army to oppose the Germans  23  Starting in early 1942 unmarried women age 19 30 were conscripted  Most were sent to the factories  but they could volunteer for the Auxiliary Territorial Service  ATS  and other women s services  None were assigned to combat roles unless they volunteered  By 1943 women were liable to some form of directed labour up to age 51  During the Second World War  1 4 million British men volunteered for service and 3 2 million were conscripted  Volunteers comprised 20  of the Army  40  of the Royal Navy  and 50  of the Royal Air Force  24  The abolition of conscription in Britain was announced on 4 April 1957 by recently elected prime minister Harold Macmillan  with the last conscripts being recruited three years later  25   edit  United States Main article  Conscription in the United States  edit  Colonial and Early National In America before 1862  combat duty was always voluntary  but white men aged 18 to 45 were usually required to join local militia units  Colonial militia laws and after 1776 those of the states required able bodied white men to enroll in the militia and to undergo a minimum of military training  all without pay  Colonial Pennsylvania  controlled by Quakers  did not have such laws  Members of pacifist religious denominations were exempt  When combat troops were needed some of the militiamen volunteered for short terms of service  for which they were paid  Following this system in its essentials  the Continental Congress in 1778 recommended that the states draft men from their militias for one year s service in the Continental army  this first national conscription was irregularly applied and failed to fill the Continental ranks  In 1814  President James Madison proposed conscription of 40 000 men for the army  but the War of 1812 ended before Congress took any action  An 1840 proposal for a standing army of 200 000 men included conscription  but it never passed and military service was voluntary before 1862  26   edit  Civil War Although both North and South resorted to conscription during the Civil War  in neither nation did the system work effectively  The Confederate congress on April 16  1862  passed an act requiring military service for three years from all males aged eighteen to thirty five not legally exempt  and it later extended the obligation  The U S  Congress followed on July 17  1862  with an act authorizing a militia draft within a state when it could not meet its quota with volunteers  This state administered system failed in practice and on March 3  1863  Congress passed the first genuine national conscription law  setting up under the Union army an elaborate machinery for enrolling and drafting men between twenty and forty five years of age  Quotas were assigned in each state  the deficiencies in volunteers to be met by conscription  But men drafted could provide substitutes or  until mid 1864  avoid service by paying commutation money  Many eligibles pooled their money to cover the cost of anyone drafted  Families used the substitute provision to select which man should go into the army and which should stay home  There was much evasion and overt resistance to the draft  especially in Catholic areas  The great draft riot in New York City in July 1863 involved Irish immigrants who had been signed up as citizens to swell the machine vote  not realizing it made them liable for the draft  Of the 168 649 men procured for the Union through the draft  117 986 were substitutes  leaving only 50 663 who had their personal services conscripted  The problem of Confederate desertion was aggravated by the inequitable inclinations of conscription officers and local judges  The three conscription acts of the Confederacy exempted certain categories  most notably the planter class  and enrolling officers and local judges often practiced favoritism  sometimes accepting bribes  Attempts to effectively deal with the issue were frustrated by conflict between state and local governments on the one hand and the national government of the Confederacy  27   edit  World War I Main article  Selective Service Act of 1917 A World War I era draft card  In 1917 the administration of Woodrow Wilson decided to rely primarily on conscription  rather than voluntary enlistment  to raise military manpower for World War I  The Selective Service Act of 1917 was carefully drawn to remedy the defects in the Civil War system and by allowing exemptions for dependency  essential occupations  and religious scruples to place each man in his proper niche in a national war effort  The act established a  liability for military service of all male citizens   authorized a selective draft of all those between twenty one and thirty one years of age  later from eighteen to forty five   and prohibited all forms of bounties  substitutions  or purchase of exemptions  Administration was entrusted to local boards composed of leading civilians in each community  These boards issued draft calls in order of numbers drawn in a national lottery and determined exemptions  In 1917 and 1918 some 24 million men were registered and nearly 3 million inducted into the military services  with little of the resistance that characterized the Civil War  28  Secretary of War Newton Baker draws the first draft number on 20 July 1917   edit  World War II In 1940 Congress passed the first peace time draft legislation  which was led by Grenville Clark  It was renewed  by one vote  in summer 1941  It involved questions as to who should control the draft  the size of the army  and the need for deferments  The system worked through local draft boards comprising community leaders who were given quotas and then decided how to fill them  There was very little draft resistance  29  The nation went from a surplus manpower pool with high unemployment and relief in 1940 to a severe manpower shortage by 1943  Industry realized that the Army urgently desired production of essential war materials and foodstuffs more than soldiers   Large numbers of soldiers were not used until the invasion of Europe in summer 1944   In 1940 43 the Army often transferred soldiers to civilian status in the Enlisted Reserve Corps in order to increase production  Those transferred would return to work in essential industry  although they could be called back to active duty if the Army needed them  Others were discharged if their civilian work was deemed absolutely essential  There were instances of mass releases of men to increase production in various industries  Blacks and Asians were drafted under the same terms as whites  One contentious issue involved the drafting of fathers  which was avoided as much as possible  The drafting of 18 year olds was desired by the military but vetoed by public opinion  Farmers demanded and were generally given occupational deferments  many volunteered anyway  and those who stayed at home were not eligible for postwar veteran s benefits   Later in the war  in light of the tremendous amount of manpower that would be necessary for the invasion of France  many earlier deferment categories became draft eligible  30   edit  Drafting of women As of 2010 update   countries that were drafting women into military service included Benin  31 Chad 32 China  33 Cuba  34 Eritrea  33  35  36 Israel  33  35  37 Libya  33  38 Malaysia  33  35 North Korea  33  35  39 Peru  33  35 Taiwan  33  35   see discussion  verification needed  and Tunisia  35  In the United Kingdom during World War II  beginning in 1941  women were brought into the scope of conscription but  as all women with dependent children were exempt and many women were informally left in occupations such as nursing or teaching  the number conscripted was relatively few  40  In 2002  Sweden considered female conscription on the grounds that excluding them goes against the ideology of equality  In the USSR  there was no systematic conscription of women for the armed forces  but the severe disruption of normal life and the high proportion of civilians affected by World War II after the German invasion attracted many volunteers for what was termed  The Great Patriotic War   41  Medical doctors of both sexes could and would be conscripted  as officers   Also  the free Soviet university education system required Department of Chemistry students of both sexes to complete an ROTC course in NBC defense  and such female reservist officers could be conscripted in times of war  The United States came close to drafting women into the Nurse Corps in preparation for a planned invasion of Japan  42  43  In 1981 in the United States  several men filed lawsuit in the case Rostker v  Goldberg  alleging that the Selective Service Act of 1948 violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by only requiring that men register with the Selective Service System  SSS   The Supreme Court eventually upheld the Act  stating that  the argument for registering women was based on considerations of equity  but Congress was entitled  in the exercise of its constitutional powers  to focus on the question of military need  rather than  equity    44  On October 1  1999 in the Taiwan Area  the Judicial Yuan of the Republic of China in its Interpretation 490 considered that the physical differences between males and females and the derived role differentiation in their respective social functions and lives would not make drafting males only violating the Constitution of the Republic of China  45   see discussion  verification needed  Though women are conscripted in Taiwan  transsexual persons are exempt  46  Traditionally conscription has been limited to the male population  Women and handicapped males have been exempted from conscription  Many societies have traditionally considered military service as a test of manhood and a rite of passage from boyhood into manhood  47  48   edit  Conscientious objection Main articles  Conscientious objection  Antimilitarism  and Conscientious objection throughout the world A conscientious objector is an individual whose personal beliefs are incompatible with military service  or  more often  with any role in the armed forces  In some countries  conscientious objectors have special legal status  which augments their conscription duties  For example  Sweden used to allow conscientious objectors to choose a service in the  weapons free  branch  such as an airport fireman  nurse or telecommunications technician  Most refuse such service  as they feel that such roles are a part of the military complex  The reasons for refusing to serve are varied  Some conscientious objectors are so for religious reasons   notably  the members of the historic peace churches  pacifist by doctrine  Jehovah s Witnesses  while not strictly pacifists  refuse to participate in the armed forces on the ground that they believe Christians should be neutral in worldly conflicts   edit  Evading the draft The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with the United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject  Please improve this article and discuss the issue on the talk page   August 2010  Main article  Draft dodger The New York Draft Riots  July 11 to July 16  1863  known at the time as Draft Week   were violent disturbances in New York City that were the culmination of discontent with new laws passed by Congress to draft men to fight in the ongoing American Civil War  The Central Asian Revolt started in the summer of 1916  when the Russian Empire government ended its exemption of Muslims from military service  The conscription also became unpopular in Grand Duchy of Finland during the reign of Nicholas II and was suspended  instead Finland paid a levy tax   military millions  as compensation for abolition of conscription  In the USA and some other countries  the Vietnam War saw new levels of opposition to conscription and the Selective Service System  Many people opposed to and facing conscription chose to either apply for classification and assignment to civilian alternative service or noncombatant service within the military as conscientious objectors  or to evade the draft by fleeing to a neutral country  A small proportion  like Muhammad Ali  chose to resist the draft by publicly and politically fighting conscription  Some people resist at the point of registration for the draft  In the USA around 1970  for example  the draft resistance movement has focused on mandatory draft registration  Others resist at the point of induction  when they are ordered to put on a uniform  when they are ordered to carry or use a weapon  or when they are ordered into combat  In the United States  especially during the Vietnam Era  some used political connections to ensure that they were placed well away from any potential harm  serving in what was termed a Champagne unit  Many would avoid military service altogether through college deferments  by becoming fathers  or serving in various exempt jobs  teaching was one possibility   Others used educational exemptions  became conscientious objectors or pretended to be conscientious objectors  although they might then be drafted for non combat work  such as serving as a combat medic  It was also possible they could be asked to do similar civilian work  such as being a hospital orderly  It was  in fact  quite easy for those with some knowledge of the system to avoid being drafted  A simple route  widely publicized  was to get a medical rejection  While a person could claim to have symptoms  or feign homosexuality  if enough physicians sent letters that a person had a problem  he might well be rejected  It often wasn t worth the Army s time to dispute this claim  Such an approach worked best in a larger city where there was no stigma to not serving  and the potential draftee was not known to those reviewing him  For others  the most common method of avoiding the draft was to cross the border into another country  People who have been  called up  for military service and who attempted to avoid it in some way were known as  draft dodgers   Particularly during the Vietnam War  US draft dodgers usually made their way to Canada  Mexico or Sweden  Many people looked upon draft dodgers with scorn as being  cowards   but some supported them in their efforts  In the late years of the Vietnam War  objections against it and support for draft dodgers was much more outspoken  because of the casualties suffered by American troops  and the actual cause and purpose of the war being heavily questioned  Toward the end of the US draft  an attempt was made to make the system somewhat fairer by turning it into a lottery  with each of the year s calendar dates randomly assigned a number  Men born on lower numbered dates were called up for review  For the reasons given above  this did not make the system any fairer  and the entire system ended in 1973  By 1975  the draft was no longer mandatory  Today  American men aged 18 25 are encouraged to sign up for the Military  but there has not been a call up since the Vietnam Era  In Israel  the Muslim and Christian Arab minority are exempt from mandatory service  as are permanent residents such as the Druze of the Golan Heights  Male Ultra Orthodox Jews may apply for a deferment of draft to study in Yeshiva  and the deferment tends to become an exemption  while female religious Jews can be exempted after presenting  religious declaration  to the IDF authorities  and some  primarily National Religious or Modern Orthodox  choose to volunteer for national service instead  Male Druze and Circassian Israeli citizens are liable  by agreement with their community leaders  Female Druze and Circassian are exempt from service   Members of the exempted groups can still volunteer  but very few do  except for the Bedouin where a relatively large number have tended to volunteer  usually for financial reasons    edit  Countries with and without mandatory military service Main article  Military service Conscription by country   Examples Country Land

against conscription  edit  Slavery American libertarians oppose it because  as Rep  Ron Paul says  since  Conscription is wrongly associated with patriotism  when it really represents slavery and involuntary servitude   110  The philosopher Ayn Rand opposed it because  Of all the statist violations of individual rights in a mixed economy  the military draft is the worst  It is an abrogation of rights  It negates man s fundamental right the right to life and establishes the fundamental principle of statism  that a man s life belongs to the state  and the state may claim it by compelling him to sacrifice it in battle   111  In 1917  a number of radicals and anarchists  including Emma Goldman  challenged the new draft law in federal court arguing that it was a direct violation of the Thirteenth Amendment s prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude  However the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the case of Arver v  United States on January 7  1918  The decision said the Constitution gave Congress the power to declare war and to raise and support armies  The Court emphasized the principle of the reciprocal rights and duties of citizens   It may not be doubted that the very conception of a just government in its duty to the citizen includes the reciprocal obligation of the citizen to render military service in case of need and the right to compel    112   edit  Economics It can be argued that in a cost to benefit ratio  conscription during peace time is not worthwhile  113  Months or years of service amongst the most fit and capable subtracts from the productivity of the economy  add to this the cost of training them  and in some countries paying them  Compared to these extensive costs  some would argue there is very little benefit  if there ever was a war then conscription and basic training could be completed quickly  and in any case there is little threat of a war in most countries with conscription  In the United States  every male resident must register with the Selective Service System on his 18th birthday  so he is available for a draft  The cost of conscription can be related to the parable of the broken window  The cost of the work in this case military service does not disappear even if no salary is paid  The work effort of the conscripts is effectively wasted  as an unwilling workforce is extremely inefficient  The impact is especially severe in wartime  when civilian professionals are forced to fight as amateur soldiers  Not only is the work effort of the conscripts wasted and productivity lost  but professionally skilled conscripts are also difficult to replace in the civilian workforce  Every soldier conscripted in the army is taken away from his civilian work  and away from contributing to the economy which funds the military  This is not a problem in an agrarian or pre industrialized state where the level of education is universally low  and where a worker is easily replaced by another  However  this proves extremely problematic in a post industrial society where educational levels are high and where the workforce is highly sophisticated and a replacement for a conscripted specialist is difficult to find  Even direr economic consequences result if the professional conscripted as an amateur soldier is killed or maimed for life  his work effort and productivity is irrevocably lost  114   edit  Arguments for conscription  edit  Political and moral motives Further information  Social contract  Social solidarity  and Active citizenship Jean Jacques Rousseau argued vehemently against professional armies  feeling it was the right and privilege of every citizen to participate to the defense of the whole society and a mark of moral decline to leave this business to professionals  He based this view on the development of the Roman republic  which came to an end at the same time as the Roman army changed from a conscript to professional force  115  Similarly  Aristotle linked the division of armed service among the populace intimately with the political order of the state  116 Niccol  Machiavelli argued strongly for conscription  seeing the professional armies as the cause of the failure of societal unity in Italy  Other proponents such as the late William James consider both mandatory military and national service as ways of instilling maturity in young adults  117  Some proponents such as Jonathan Alter and Mickey Kaus support a draft in order to reinforce social equality  create social consciousness  break down class divisions and for young adults to immerse themselves in public enterprise  118  119  120   edit  Economic  amp  resource efficiency Further information  Industrial warfare  Total war  and War effort It is estimated by the British military that in a professional military  one company deployed for active duty in peacekeeping corresponds to three inactive companies at home  Salaries for each are paid from the military budget  In contrast  volunteers from a trained reserve are in their civilian jobs when they are not deployed  121   edit  Related concepts Arri re ban Civil conscription Civilian Public

could be reintroduced by proclamation of the Governor General  Potentially all Australian residents between the ages of 18 and 60 could be called up in this way  However  the Defence Legislation Amendment Act 1992 further provided that any such proclamation is of no effect until it is approved by both Houses of Parliament  Though actual legislation is not required  the effect of this provision is to make the introduction of conscription impossible without the approval of both the Senate and the House of Representatives  Gary Brown  October 12  1999    Current Issues Brief 7 1999
