Young adult fiction From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Redirected from Young adult novel  Jump to  navigation  search This article may be in need of reorganization to comply with Wikipedia s

juvenile fiction  is fiction written  published  or marketed to adolescents and young adults  approximately ages 10 to 20  3  The Young Adult Library Services  YALSA  of the American Library Association  ALA  defines a young adult as  someone between the ages of twelve and eighteen   Authors and readers of young adult  YA  novels often define the genre as  literature written for ages ranging from ten years up to the age of twenty   Cole   Another  though somewhat controversial  definition is that Young Adult Literature is any text being read by adolescents  Accordingly  the terms young adult novel  juvenile novel  young adult book  etc  refer to the works in the YA category  YA literature shares the following fundamental elements of the fiction genre  character  plot  setting  theme  and style  However  theme and style are often subordinated to the more tangible elements of plot  setting  and character  which appeal more readily to younger readers  The vast majority of YA stories portray an adolescent  rather than an adult or child  as the protagonist  The subject matter and story lines of YA literature are typically consistent with the age and experience of the main character  but  beyond that  YA stories span the spectrum of fiction genres  Themes in YA stories often focus on the challenges of youth  sometimes referred to as problem novels or coming of age novels  4  Writing styles of YA stories range widely  from the richness of literary style to the clarity and speed of the unobtrusive and free verse  Contents 1 History of young adult fiction 1 1

first recognition of young adults as a distinct group was by Sarah Trimmer  who  in 1802  described  young adulthood  as lasting from ages 14 to 21  3  In her self founded children s literature periodical  The Guardian of Education  Trimmer introduced the terms  Books for Children   for those under fourteen  and  Books for Young Persons   for those between fourteen and twenty one   establishing terms of reference for young adult literature that remain in use today  3  However  nineteenth century publishers did not specifically market to young readers  and adolescent culture did not exist in a modern sense   edit  The Beginning Beginning in the 1920s  it was said that  this was the first time when it became clear that the young were a separate generation   Cart 43  yet  multiple novels within the YA category had been published long before  Nineteenth century literature presents several early examples that appealed to young readers  Garland 1998  p  6  including  The Swiss Family Robinson  1812   Waverley  1814   Oliver Twist  1838   The Count of Monte Cristo  1844   Tom Brown s Schooldays  1857   Great Expectations  1860   Alice in Wonderland  1865   The Adventures of Tom Sawyer  1876   Adventures of Huckleberry Finn  1884   Kidnapped  1886   The Jungle Book  1894  and Moonfleet  1898   A few other novels published around the turn of the century include Treasure Island  by Robert Louis Stevenson  Heidi  by Johanna Spyri  and Black Beauty by Anna Sewell  J  R  R  Tolkien s The Hobbit  published in 1937  and Betty Smith s A Tree Grows in Brooklyn  published in 1943  are also read by adolescents today  Some claim that the first real young adult novel was The Catcher in the Rye by J  D  Salinger  and that it opened up a new eye to what types of texts adolescent readers read  Following this novel  other classic texts such as Harper Lee s To Kill a Mockingbird  Maya Angelou s I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings  and Toni Morrison s The Bluest Eye entered the genre of Young Adult Literature as well  along with many others   edit  Mid Century In the 1950s  shortly before the advent of modern publishing for the teen romance market  two novels drew the attention of adolescent readers  The Catcher in the Rye  1951   and Lord of the Flies  1954   Unlike more recent fiction classified as YA  these two were written with an adult audience in mind  5  The modern classification of young adult fiction originated during the 1950s and 1960s  especially after the publication of S E  Hinton s The Outsiders  It focused on a group of teens not yet represented in works of fiction  Instead of having the nostalgic tone  which was typical in young adult books written by adults  it displayed a truer  darker side of adolescent life because it was written by a young adult  As the decades moved on  the stormy sixties became the era  when the  under 30  generation became a subject of popular concern  and that research on adolescence began to emerge  It would also be the decade when literature for adolescents could be said to have come into its own   Cart 43   For this reason others adopt The Outsiders  published in 1967 by S  E  Hinton  who at the time was only a teenager  as the initiator of the adolescent literature genre  This catapulted discussions about adolescent experiences and the new idea of adolescent authors  1967 sparked the production in growth of this now thriving genre  In the 1970s  what has become to be known as the  fab five  were published   For the record  the fab five are  I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou  The Friends by Rosa Guy  The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath  Bless the Beasts and Children by Glendon Swarthout  and Deathwatch by Robb White   Cart 77    edit  Through the Decades As publishers began to focus on the emerging adolescent market  booksellers and libraries  began creating YA sections distinct from either children s literature or novels written for adults  The 1970s to the mid 1980s have been described as the golden age of young adult fiction when challenging novels began speaking directly to the interests of the identified adolescent market  3  In the 1980s   the 1980s contained a large amount of Young Adult publications which pushed the threshold of topics that adolescents faced such as rape  suicide  parental death  and murder  Also in the 1980s   teenagers seemed to want to read about something closer to their daily lives romance novels were revived   Cart 99   In the 1990s  Young Adult Literature pushed adolescent issues even further by including topics such as  drinking  sexuality  drug use  identity  beauty  and even teen pregnancy   Lubar   Also in the 1990s  it seemed as though the era of Young Adult Literature was going to lose steam but  due in part to an increase in the number of teenagers in the 1990s the field matured  blossomed  and came into its own with the better written  more serious  and more varied young adult books published during the last two decades   Tomlinson and Lynch Brown 5    edit  Notable authors V C  Andrews  1923 1986   American author of several popular gothic horror family sagas for teenagers

various types of text including  novels  graphic novels  short stories  and poetry  Much of the literature published consists of young adult fiction which in itself contains several different types of text  The genre also contains other various types of non fiction such as biographies  autobiographies  journal entries diaries  and letters  Although many genres exist in young adult literature  the problem novel tends to be the most popular among young readers  Problem novel refers to young adult novels in the realistic fiction category that  addresses personal and social issues across socioeconomic boundaries and within both traditional and nontraditional family structures   Cole 98   Memoirs are also popular forms of Young Adult Literature  Another common genre within young adult fiction is Bildungsroman  a coming of age story that showcases the process of  growing up   The genre itself has been challenged due its seemingly mature content by critics of Young Adult Literature  but  other converted critics have embraced Young Adult so dearly that they have scoured the canon for any classics they could adopt into the YA family   Stephens 2007    edit  Themes Young Adult Literature uses a wide array of themes in order to appeal to a wide variety of adolescent readers  Some of these themes include  identity  sexuality  science fiction  depression  suicide  drug abuse  alcohol abuse  familial struggles  bullying  and numerous others  Some issues discussed in Young Adult Literature include  friendship  love  race  money  divorce  relationships within families  7   The culture that surrounds and absorbs young adults plays a huge role in their lives  Young Adult Literature explores themes important and crucial to adolescence such as relationships to authority figures  peer pressure and ensuing experimentations  issues of diversity as it relates to gender  sociocultural  and or socioeconomic status  Primarily  the focus is centered around a young lead character and the reader experiences emotions  situations  and the like through this character and is able to see how these problems situations are resolved  8  It also needs to play a significant role in how we approach this group and the books we offer them to read   Lesesne 14   Reading about issues that adolescents can relate to allows them to identify with a particular character  and creates a sense of security when experiencing something that is going on within their lives   Whether you call them archetypes or stereotypes  there are certain experiences and certain kinds of people that are common to adolescents  Reading about it may help a young person validate his or her own experience and make some kind of meaning out of it   Blasingame  12   In a paper written by April Dawn Wells  she discovers seventeen common traits of young adult novels  These include   friendship  getting into trouble  interest in the opposite sex  money  divorce  single parents  remarriage  problems with parents  grandparents  younger siblings  concern over grades school  popularity  puberty  race  death  neighborhood  and job working  9   edit  Characteristics Young adult literature contains specific characteristics that are present throughout the genre  These characteristics encompass   multi themed story  tension versus shock effect  memorable characters  accurate facts and details  some unlikely coincidences  original ideas  memorable voice  authentic dialogue  effective clear writing style  sense of humor  widespread appeal  intriguing openings and memorable closings   Cole 61 65   Other characteristics of Young Adult Literature include    1  Characters and issues young readers can identify with  those issues and characters are treated in a way that does not invalidate  minimize  or devalue them   2  Is framed in language that young readers can understand   3  Emphasizes plot above everything else  and  4 Is written for an audience of young adults   Blasingame 11   Overall  Young Adult Literature needs to contain specific elements that will not only interest readers of this genre  but elements that relate directly to real situations adolescents in all generations may encounter  and contain believable  empathetic characters   edit  Usage in Education Research suggests young adult literature can be advantageous to reluctant student readers by addressing their needs  Authors who write young adult literature have an adolescent s age and interests in mind  The language and plots of young adult literature are similar to what students are accustomed to finding in reality  television  movies  and popular culture  Bucher  Manning  328 332   The following are criteria that researchers have come up with to evaluate the effectiveness of young adult literature in the classroom  Bucher and Manning  9 10   The subject matter should reflect age and development by addressing their interest levels  reading and thinking levels  The content should deal with contemporary issues and experiences with characters adolescents can relate  Subjects can relate to dealing with parents and adults  illness and death  peer pressure with regards to drugs  sex  and the complications of addiction and pregnancy  The content should consider existing global concerns such as cultural  social  and gender diversity  environmental and political issues as it relates to adolescents  Young Adult Literature has been integrated into classrooms in order to increase student interest in reading  Research has been performed on what type of impact the introduction YA Literature has on students  particularly adolescent males and struggling readers   Researchers have shown that introducing YA Literature to males improves their reading ability  YA Literature  because of its range of authors and story types  is an appropriate literature for every adolescent male who needs compelling material that speaks to him   Gill   Research shows that not only adolescent males have been labeled as reluctant readers  struggling readers use reluctance as a coping mechanism  Young Adult Literature has been used to open up the door of reading literature to these readers as well   When voluntary reading declines  the problems of struggling readers are only aggravated  By allowing adolescents to read good young adult literature  educators are able to encourage independent reading  which will  in turn  help adolescents develop the skills necessary to succeed   Bucher and Manning   Another reason that Young Adult Literature has been incorporated into classrooms is to be paired with classic texts that are traditionally read in classrooms  and required by many schools curricula  Using YA Lit alongside a canonical piece of text can increase a students comprehension of the common themes the various texts have  and make reading a classic text more enjoyable   Young adult literature can spark interest in the classics and vice versa  Although it s clear that young adult literature is more accessible  that doesn t warrant denying the classics to struggling readers  The classics shouldn t be reserved for exceptional students  and Young Adult Literature shouldn t be reserved for at risk readers   Cole 513   Young Adult Literature can increase the students interest and give the students more options in their readings   edit  Situational Archetypes in Literature The classic canon in high school literature classes can often be too overwhelming and far removed from the everyday life of an adolescent  Sarah K  Herz and Donald Gallo suggest using archetypes from traditional literature to  build bridges  to the classics through young adult literature  Young Adult Literature offers teachers an effective way to introduce the study of archetypes in literature by grouping a variety of titles around archetypal situations and characters  Herz and Gallo suggest before or after studying a traditional classic or contemporary novel it is a good time to introduce the concept of archetypes in literature  Based on the Jungian theory of archetypes  consider a literary archetype as a character type or theme which recurs frequently in literature  Herz and Gallo  64 66   Recognizing archetypes in literature will help students build the foundation for making connection among various works of literature  Students can begin to grasp and identify the archetypal images and patterns that appear in new forms  Archetypes also help students become more conscious of an author s style and to think about and recognize the way in which a particular writer develops a character or story  Herz and Gallo  66    edit  Using Classic Situational Archetypes in the Classroom A partial list of classic situational literary archetypes as

pushed the edge of then acceptable content  Such novels and their content are sometimes referred to as  edgy   In particular  authors and publishers have repeatedly pushed the boundaries of what was

argue that the novels encourage destructive or immoral behavior  Others argue that fictional portrayal of teens successfully addressing difficult situations and confronting social issues helps readers deal with real life challenges  Debate continues regarding the amount and nature of violence and profanity appropriate in young adult fiction   edit  Hyphens  young adult vs  young adult  Recognition of the noun young adult and its punctuation as an adjectival modifier are inconsistent  Some dictionaries recognize young adult as a noun  Random House  2nd 1987   while others do not  Webster s International  3rd 2002   When recognized  as by Random House   young adult is treated as an open compound noun  with no hyphen  When the noun young adult is placed before another noun  such as fiction  novel  author   however  the use of a hyphen varies widely  For example  an Internet search  of the Web or of news articles  using the key words young adult fiction shows widespread inconsistency in hyphenation  Although the Chicago Manual of Style falls short of declaring the omission of the hyphen as grammatically incorrect  it clearly addresses the issue in  Compounds and Hyphenation   sections 7 82 7 86   When such compounds precede a noun  hyphenation usually makes for easier reading  With the exception of proper nouns  such as United States  and compounds formed by an adverb ending in ly plus an adjective  it is never incorrect to hyphenate adjectival compounds before a noun   Chicago Manual of Style  15th Edition 2003  p  300  The Writer s Digest Grammar Desk Reference is a little more forceful on the subject   The most complicated business conducted by hyphens is uniting words into adjectival compounds that precede nouns  Many writers neglect to hyphenate such compounds  and the result is ramshackle sentences that often frustrate the reader    Writer s Digest Grammar Desk Reference 2005  pp  274 275  The Wikipedia Manual of Style also addresses the issue of hyphens for compound adjectives  Although none of the sources cited above list young adult as an example  each clearly expresses a preference for hyphenating compound modifiers  With that in mind  young adult is a noun  without a hyphen  as defined by Random House  But when the noun young adult precedes another noun  it becomes a compound modifier and warrants a hyphen  as in young adult fiction  young adult author  young adult novel  and so on  Because the sources do not declare the absence of a hyphen as grammatically incorrect  widespread inconsistencies in the punctuation of young adult are likely to continue  either out of ignorance or as conscious choice of style   edit  Literature Whether any particular work of fiction qualifies as literature can be disputed  In recent years  however  YA fiction has been increasingly treated as an object of serious study by children s literature critics  A growing number of young adult fiction awards recognize outstanding works of fiction for adolescents   edit  Trends The category of YA fiction continues to expand into new genres  graphic novels  light novels  manga  fantasy  mystery fiction  romance novels  even subcategories such as
