District Disneyland Park is a theme park located in Anaheim  California  owned and operated by the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts division of the Walt Disney Company  Known as Disneyland when it opened on July 18  1955  and still almost universally referred to by that name  it is the only theme park to be designed and built under the direct supervision of Walt Disney  In 1998  the theme park was re branded Disneyland Park to distinguish it from the larger Disneyland Resort complex  Walt Disney came up with the concept of Disneyland after visiting various amusement parks with his daughters in the 1930s and 1940s  He initially envisioned building a tourist attraction adjacent to his studios in Burbank to entertain fans who wished to visit  however  he soon realized that the proposed site was too small  After hiring a consultant to help determine an appropriate site for his project  Walt bought a 160 acre  65 ha  site near Anaheim in 1953  Construction began in 1954 and the park was unveiled during a special televised press event on July 17  1955  Since its opening  Disneyland has undergone a number of expansions and renovations  including the addition of New Orleans Square in 1966  Bear Country  now Critter Country  in 1972  and Mickey s Toontown in 1993  Disney California Adventure Park was built on the site of Disneyland s original parking lot and opened in 2001  Disneyland has a larger cumulative attendance than any other theme park in the world  with close to 600 million guests since it opened  In 2010  15 98 million people visited the park  making it the

and promise of the future  Disneyland is dedicated to the ideals  the dreams  and the hard facts that have created America  with the hope that it will be a source of joy and inspiration to all the world     Walter E  Disney  July 17  1955 4 43pm 2  History Concept and construction Walt Disney  center  showing Orange County officials plans for Disneyland s layout in December 1954 The concept for Disneyland began when Walt Disney was visiting Griffith Park in Los Angeles with his daughters Diane and Sharon  While watching them ride the merry go round  he came up with the idea of a place where adults and their children could go and have fun together  His dream lay dormant for many years  3  Walt Disney also may have been influenced by his father s memories of the World s Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago  his father worked at the Exposition   The Midway Plaisance there included a set of attractions representing various countries from around the world and others representing various periods of man  it also included many rides including the first Ferris wheel  a  sky  ride  a passenger train that circled the perimeter  and a Wild West Show  Another likely influence was Benton Harbor  Michigan s nationally famous House of David s Eden Springs Park  Walt Disney visited the park and ultimately bought one of the older miniature trains originally used there  the colony had the largest miniature railway setup in the world at the time  4  While many people wrote letters to Walt Disney about visiting the Disney Studio  he realized that a functional movie studio had little to offer to the visiting fans  This began to foster ideas of building a site near his Burbank studios for tourists to visit  His ideas then evolved to a small play park with a boat ride and other themed areas  Disney s initial concept  his  Mickey Mouse Park   started with an 8 acre  3 2 ha  plot across Riverside Drive  Disney started to visit other parks for inspiration and ideas  including Tivoli Gardens in Denmark  Efteling in The Netherlands and Greenfield Village  Playland  and Children s Fairyland in the USA  He started his designers working on concepts  but these would grow into a project much larger than could be contained in 8 acres  3 2 ha   5  Disney hired a consultant  Harrison Price from Stanford Research Institute  to gauge the proper area to locate the theme park based on the area s potential growth  With the report from Price  Disney acquired 160 acres  65 ha  of orange groves and walnut trees in Anaheim  southeast of Los Angeles in neighboring Orange County  5  6  Sleeping Beauty Castle during the Happiest Homecoming on Earth Difficulties in obtaining funding prompted Disney to investigate new methods of fundraising  He decided to use television  and created a show named Disneyland which was broadcast on the then fledgling ABC television network  In return  the network agreed to help finance the new park  For the first five years of its operation  Disneyland was owned by Disneyland  Inc   which was jointly owned by Walt Disney Productions  Walt Disney  Western Publishing and ABC  7  In addition  Disney rented out many of the shops on Main Street  U S A  to outside companies  By 1960 Walt Disney Productions completely bought out ABC s  Western Publishing and Walt Disney s shares  Construction began on July 16  1954 and cost  17 million to complete  The park was opened one year and one day later  8 U S  Route 101  later Interstate 5  was under construction at the same time just to the north of the site  in preparation for the traffic Disneyland was expected to bring  two more lanes were added to the freeway before the park was finished  6  July 1955  Dedication Day and Opening Day An aerial view of Disneyland in 1956  The entire route of the Disneyland Railroad is clearly visible as it encircles the park  Disneyland Park was opened to the public on July 18  1955 with only 20 attractions  A special  International Press Preview  event was held on Sunday  July 17  1955  which was only open to invited guests and the media  The Special Sunday events  including the dedication  were televised nationwide and anchored by three of Walt Disney s friends from Hollywood  Art Linkletter  Bob Cummings  and Ronald Reagan  ABC broadcast the event live on its network  which added many problems of its own  Many guest tripped over the TV camera cables  9  Camera cuts went bad  In Frontierland  a camera caught Bob Cummings kissing a dancer  When Walt Disney started to read the plauqe for Tomorrowland  he read part way then stopped when a technition off camera said something to him  He relised he was live on air  and said  I though I got a signal    10  He then started the dedication of Tomorrowland from the start  At one point while in Fantasyland  Linkletter tried to through coverage to Cummings  who was on the pirateship  Cummings was not really ready to take over  so he tired to give the coverage back to Art Linkletter  but for some reason  Linkletter had lost his mike  so Bob Cummings did a play by play of him trying to find a mike in front of Mr  Toad s Wild Ride  11  The event did not go smoothly  Traffic backed up on the two lane Harbor Boulevard  12  The park was overcrowded as the by invitation only affair was plagued with counterfeit tickets  Only 11 000 people were expected to show up  but a staggering 28 154 was the eventual population  Movie stars and other famous figures scheduled to come every two hours showed up all at once  All major roads nearby were empty  The temperature was an unusually high 101  F  38  C   and a plumbers  strike left many of the park s drinking fountains dry  Disney was given a choice of having working fountains or running toilets and he chose the latter  This generated negative publicity since Pepsi sponsored the park s opening  disappointed guests believed the inoperable fountains were a cynical way to sell soda  The asphalt that had been poured just that morning was so soft that ladies  high heeled shoes sank into it  Vendors ran out of food  A gas leak in Fantasyland caused Adventureland  Frontierland  and Fantasyland to close for the afternoon  Some parents were seen throwing their children over the shoulders of crowds to get them onto rides such as the King Arthur Carrousel  13  The park got such bad press for the  International Press Preview  that Walt Disney invited attendees back for a private  second day  to experience Disneyland properly  In later years Disney and his 1955 executives referred to July 17  1955 as  Black Sunday   Today  cast members wear pin badges on July 17 in celebration of the park s anniversary  stating how many years it has been since the 1955 opening  But for the first decade or so  Disney officially stated that opening day was on July 18  1955 and celebrated the 18th as its Anniversary  For example  a 1967 Disneyland press release referred to July 17  1955  as  Dedication Day  and not  Opening Day   On Opening Day  Monday July 18  crowds started to gather in line as early as 2 a m   and the first person to buy a ticket and enter the park was David MacPherson with admission ticket number 2  as Roy O  Disney arranged to pre purchase ticket number 1 from Curtis Lineberry  the manager of admissions  Walt Disney had an official photo taken with two children  Christine Vess Watkins  age 5  and Michael Schwartner  7   the photo of the three carries an inaccurate caption identifying the children as the first two guests of Disneyland  Watkins and Schwartner both received lifetime passes to Disneyland that day  and MacPherson was awarded one shortly thereafter  which was later expanded to every single Disney owned park in the world  Approximately 50 000 guests attended the Monday Opening day  The early years In September 1959  Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev spent thirteen days in the United States  On his visit Khrushchev had two requests  to visit Disneyland and to meet John Wayne  Hollywood s top box office draw  Due to the Cold War tension and security concerns  he was famously denied an excursion to Disneyland  14 The Shah of Iran and Empress Farah were invited to Disneyland by Walt Disney in early 1960s  The video of the Shah and Disney riding the Matterhorn roller coaster is available on YouTube  There was some controversy about the lack of African American employees at the park  Since 1963  civil rights activists were pressuring Disneyland to start hiring black people  The Disneyland executives said they would  consider  their requests  Despite a lack of Black employees  Disneyland had hired people of Asian descent like Ty Wong and Bob Kuwahara  15  16  1990s transition  Park becomes Resort Disney California Adventure Park In the late 1990s  work began to expand on the one park  one hotel property  Disneyland Park  the Disneyland Hotel and the site of the original parking lot as well as acquired surrounding properties were earmarked to become part of a greater vacation resort development  The new components of this resort were to be another theme park  Disney California Adventure Park  a shopping  dining and entertainment complex  Downtown Disney  a remodeled Disneyland Hotel  Disney s Grand Californian Hotel  amp  Spa  and the acquisition of the Pan Pacific Hotel  later to be remodeled and renamed Disney s Paradise Pier Hotel   Because the existing parking lot  south of Disneyland  was built upon by these projects  the six level  10 250 space Mickey and Friends parking structure was constructed in the northwest corner of the property  At the time of its completion in 2000  it was the largest parking structure in the United States  17  Downtown Disney The park s management team during the mid 1990s was a source of controversy among Disneyland fans and employees  In an effort to boost profits  various changes began by then executives Cynthia Harriss and Paul Pressler  While their actions provided a short term increase in shareholder returns  they drew widespread criticism from employees and guests alike for the lack of foresight  With the retail background of Harriss and Pressler  Disneyland s focus gradually shifted from attractions to merchandising  Outside consultants McKinsey  amp  Company were also brought in to help streamline operations  which resulted in many changes and cutbacks  After nearly a decade of deferred maintenance  Walt Disney s original theme park was showing visible signs of neglect  Fans of the park decried the perceived decline in customer value and park quality and rallied for the dismissal of the management team  18  Disneyland in the 21st century Plaque at the entrance Matt Ouimet  formerly the president of the Disney Cruise Line  was promoted to assume leadership of the Disneyland Resort in late 2003  Shortly afterward  he selected Greg Emmer as Senior Vice President of Operations  Emmer is a long time Disney cast member who had worked at Disneyland in his youth prior to moving to Florida and held multiple executive leadership positions at the Walt Disney World Resort  Ouimet quickly set about reversing certain trends  especially with regards to cosmetic maintenance and a return to the original infrastructure maintenance schedule  in hopes of restoring the safety record of the past  Much like Walt Disney himself  Ouimet and Emmer could often be seen walking the park during business hours with members of their respective staff  They wore cast member name badges  stood in line for attractions and welcomed comments from guests  In July 2006  Matt Ouimet announced that he would be leaving The Walt Disney Company to become president of Starwood Hotels  amp  Resorts Worldwide  Soon after this announcement  Ed Grier  executive managing director of Walt Disney Attractions Japan  was named president of the Disneyland Resort  Greg Emmer retired from his job on February 8  2008  In October 2009  Ed Grier announced his retirement  and was replaced by George Kalogridis as the new President of the Disneyland Resort  50th Anniversary Main article  Happiest Homecoming on Earth The  Happiest Homecoming on Earth  was an eighteen month long celebration  held through 2005 and 2006  of the 50th anniversary of the Disneyland theme park  which opened on July 18  1955  The Happiest Celebration on Earth commemorated fifty years of Disney theme parks  and celebrated Disneyland s milestone throughout Disney parks all over the globe  In 2004  the park undertook a number of major renovation projects in preparation for its fiftieth anniversary celebration  Many classic attractions were restored  notably Space Mountain  Jungle Cruise  the Haunted Mansion  Pirates of the Caribbean  and Walt Disney s Enchanted Tiki Room  Attractions that had been in the park on opening day in 1955 had one ride vehicle painted gold  and the park was decorated with 50 Golden Mickey Ears  The 50th Anniversary celebration started on May 5  2005 and ended on September 30  2006  It was followed by the  Year of a Million Dreams  celebration  which lasted 27 months and ended on December 31  2008  55th Anniversary Starting on January 1  2010  Disney Parks hosted the Give a Day  Get a Disney Day volunteer program  in which Disney encouraged people of all ages to volunteer with a participating charity and receive a free Disney Day at either a Disneyland Resort park in California or at a Walt Disney World Resort park in Florida  On March 9  2010  Disney announced that it had reached its goal of one million volunteers and ended the promotion to anyone who had not yet registered and signed up for a specific volunteer situation  Park layout Aerial view of Disneyland in 1963

Freeway and Melodyland Theater  The park is divided into  lands   themed areas  and well concealed backstage areas  On entering a land  a guest is completely immersed in a themed environment and is unable to see or hear any other realm  The idea behind this was to develop theatrical  stages  with seamless passages from one land to the next  5  The public areas occupy approximately 85 acres  34 ha   When the park initially opened  it consisted of five themed areas  Main Street  U S A   designed to resemble an early 20th century Midwest town  Adventureland  featuring jungle themed adventures  Frontierland  illustrating an American Old West frontier town  Fantasyland  bringing to life characters and places from Disney s animated movies  Tomorrowland  an optimistic vision of the future  Since the initial opening  additional areas have been added  In 1957  Holidayland  a 9 acres  3 6 ha  recreation area including a circus and baseball diamond  which was closed in late 1961  In 1966  New Orleans Square  based on 19th century New Orleans  In 1972  Bear Country  themed around the mountain forests of the American South  It was later renamed Critter Country and themed around Splash Mountain s Song of the South elements  In 1993  Mickey s Toontown  themed around the Toontown seen in the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit  Throughout the park are  Hidden Mickeys   or representations of Mickey Mouse heads inserted subtly into the design of attractions and environmental decor  An elevated berm supports a narrow gauge railroad that circumnavigates the park  Disney California Adventure Park was added in what used to be a parking lot for Disneyland guests  Lands of Disneyland Main articles  List of current Disneyland attractions and List of past Disneyland attractions Disneyland has eight themed areas or  lands  that host various shops  restaurants  live entertainment  and attractions  A ninth area  albeit defunct  is Holidayland  a picnic ground which operated between 1957 and 1961 and is often referred to as the  lost  land of Disneyland  Main Street  U S A  Main article  Main Street  U S A  Main Street  USA as seen on July 4  2010 Main Street  U S A  is patterned after a typical Midwest town of the early 20th century  Walt Disney derived inspiration from his boyhood town of Marceline  Missouri and worked closely with designers and architects to develop the Main Street appeal  It is the first area guests see when they enter the park  if not entering by monorail   and is how guests reach Central Plaza  At the center of The Magic Kingdom and immediately North of Central Plaza stands Sleeping Beauty Castle  which provides entrance to Fantasyland by way of a drawbridge across a moat  Adventureland  Frontierland  and Tomorrowland are arrayed on both sides of the castle    For those of us who remember the carefree time it recreates  Main Street will bring back happy memories  For younger visitors  it is an adventure in turning back the calendar to the days of grandfather s youth        Walt E  Disney Main Street  U S A  is reminiscent of the Victorian period of America with the train station  town square  movie theater  city hall  firehouse complete with a steam powered pump engine  emporium  shops  arcades  double decker bus  horse drawn streetcar  jitneys and other bits of memorabilia  Main Street is also home to the Disney Art Gallery and the Opera House which showcases Great Moments with Mr  Lincoln a show featuring an Audio Animatronic version of the president  There are many specialty stores on Main Street including  a candy store  jewelry and watch shop  a silhouette station  a store that sells Disney collectable items created by various artists  and a hat shop where you have the option of creating your own ear hat along with a personalized embrodiery  At the far end of Main Street  U S A  is Sleeping Beauty Castle  and the Central Plaza  also known as the Hub   which is a portal to most of the themed lands  Several lands are not directly connected to the Central Plaza namely  New Orleans Square  Critter Country and Mickey s Toontown  The design of Main Street  U S A  uses the technique of forced perspective to create an illusion of height  Buildings along Main Street are built at 3 4 scale on the first level  then 5 8 on the second story  and 1 2 scale on the third reducing the scale by 1 8 each level up  Adventureland Main article  Adventureland  Disney  Adventureland provides a 1950s view of adventure  capitalizing on the post war Tiki craze  Adventureland is designed to recreate the feel of an exotic tropical place in a far off region of the world   To create a land that would make this dream reality   said Walt Disney   we pictured ourselves far from civilization  in the remote jungles of Asia and Africa   Attractions include opening day s Jungle Cruise  the  Temple of the Forbidden Eye  in Indiana Jones Adventure  and Tarzan s Treehouse  which is a conversion of the earlier Swiss

on the 1946 Disney film Song of the South  Critter Country opened in 1972 as  Bear Country   and was renamed in 1988  Formerly the area was home to Indian Village  where indigenous tribespeople demonstrated their dances and other customs  Today  the main draw of the area is Splash Mountain  a log flume journey inspired by the Uncle Remus stories of Joel Chandler Harris and the animated segments of Disney s Academy Award winning 1946 film  Song of the South  In 2003  a dark ride called The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh replaced the Country Bear Jamboree  which closed in 2001

 The Adventures Continue in June 2011  Theatrical terminology Disneyland staff use theatrical terminology  This is to emphasize that a visit to the park is intended to be similar to witnessing a performance  For example  visitors are referred to as  guests  and park employees as  cast members    On stage  refers to any area of the resort that is open to guests   Backstage  refers to any area of the resort that is closed to guests  A crowd is referred to as an  audience    Costume  is the attire that cast members who perform the day to day operations of the park must wear  Terms such as  uniform  are not used   Show  is the resort s presentation to its guests  such as the color and fa ades of buildings  placement of rides and attractions  costumes to match the themed lands  When signing credit card receipts for souvenirs or food  guests are asked for their  autograph    Stage managers  are responsible for overseeing the operation of the different areas of the park  Cast members who are in charge of a specific team are called  leads   as in a film or theater  lead role   In the earlier years of the park  the offices where administrative work took place were referred to as  production offices    Production schedulers  build employee work schedules to meet the necessary workload  while  stage schedulers  handle day to day changes in that work schedule  such as a change in park hours  necessitating a change in everybody s shifts   Each cast member s job is called a  role   When working in their roles  cast members must follow a  script   This is not a traditional play script  but more of a strict code of conduct and approved  themed phraseology that cast members may use when at work  Park employees are often reminded that  no  and  I don t know  are not a part of a cast member s script  Backstage This section includes a list of references  related reading or external links  but its sources remain unclear because it lacks inline citations  Please improve this article by introducing more precise citations   October 2010  Backstage areas include closed areas of attraction  store  and restaurant buildings  as well as outdoor service areas located behind such buildings  Although some areas of the park  particularly New Orleans Square  have underground operations and storage areas  there is no park wide network of subterranean tunnels  such as Walt Disney World s utilidors  There are several points of entry from outside the park to the backstage areas  Ball Gate  from Ball Road   T D A  Gate  adjacent to the Team Disney Anaheim building   Harbor Pointe  from Harbor Boulevard   and Winston Gate  from Disneyland Drive   Berm Road encircles the park from Firehouse Gate  behind the Main Street Fire Station  to Egghouse Gate  adjacent to the Disneyland Opera House   The road is so called because it generally follows outside the path of Disneyland s berm  A stretch of the road  wedged between Tomorrowland and Harbor Boulevard  is called Schumacher Road  It has two narrow lanes and runs underneath the Monorail track  There are also two railroad bridges that cross Berm Road  one behind City Hall and the other behind Tomorrowland  Major buildings backstage include the Frank Gehry designed Team Disney Anaheim  where most of the division s administration currently works  as well as the Old Administration Building  behind Tomorrowland  The Old Administration Building additionally houses the Grand Canyon and Primeval World dioramas visible on the Disneyland Railroad  The northwest corner of the park is home to most of the park s maintenance facilities  including  Company vehicle services  including Parking Lot trams and Main Street Vehicles Scrap yard  where the Resort s garbage and recyclables are sorted for collection Circle D Corral  where the Resort s horses and other animals are stabled Parade float storage and maintenance Distribution center for all Resort merchandise Ride vehicle service areas Paint shop Sign shop Backstage also refers to parts of show buildings that are normally not seen by guests  Backstage areas are generally off limits to park guests  This prevents guests from seeing the industrial areas that violate the  magic  of on stage and keeps them safe from the potentially dangerous machinery  Cast members can also find some solace while they work or rest  as backstage offers alternate routes between the park s various areas  Many attractions are housed in large  soundstage like buildings  some of which are partially or completely disguised by external theming  Generally  these buildings are painted a dull green color in areas not seen by guests  ostensibly  this choice has been made to help disguise the buildings among the foliage and make them less visually obtrusive  Walt Disney Imagineering has termed this color   Go Away Green   Most of them have off white flat roofs that support HVAC units and footpaths for cast members  Inside are the rides  as well as hidden walkways  service areas  control rooms  and other behind the scenes operations  Photography is forbidden in these areas  both inside and outside  although some photos have found their way to a variety of web sites  Guests who attempt to explore backstage are warned and often escorted from the property  The boundary between on and off stage is demarcated at every access point  Everything within guest view when a door or gateway is open is also considered on stage  It is from this point  that characters start playing their part  That way  when the door is open  guests will not accidentally see a person out of character backstage  Various amenities exist for Cast Members backstage when they are on breaks  or before and after their scheduled shifts  A number of cafeterias  now run by Sodexo  offer discounted meals throughout the day  These include Inn Between  behind the Plaza Inn   Eat Ticket  near the Team Disney Anaheim building behind Mickey s Toontown   and Westsider Grill  located approximately behind New Orleans Square   Partners Federal Credit Union  the credit union for employees of The Walt Disney Company in Orange County  provides nearly 20 ATMs backstage for cast member use and maintains an express branch at the Team Disney Anaheim building  Transportation Walt Disney had a longtime interest in transportation  and trains in particular  Disney s passion for the  iron horse  led to him building a miniature live steam backyard railroad the  Carolwood Pacific Railroad  on the grounds of his Holmby Hills estate  Throughout all the iterations of Disneyland during the seventeen or so years when Disney was conceiving it  one element remained constant  a train encircling the park  3  The primary designer for the park transportation vehicles was Bob Gurr who gave himself the title of Director of Special Vehicle Design in 1954  Disneyland Railroad Disneyland Railroad Engine 2 Main article  Disneyland Railroad Encircling Disneyland and providing a grand circle tour is the Disneyland Railroad  DRR   a short line railway consisting of five oil fired and steam powered locomotives  in addition to three passenger trains and one passenger carrying freight train  Originally known as the Disneyland and Santa Fe Railroad  the DRR was presented by the Atchison  Topeka and Santa Fe Railway until 1974  From 1955 to 1974  the Santa Fe Rail Pass was able to be used in lieu of a Disneyland  D  coupon  With a three foot gauge  the most common narrow gauge measurement used in North America  the track runs in a continuous loop around The Magic Kingdom through each of its realms  Each turn of the 19th Century train departs Main Street Station on an excursion that includes scheduled station stops at  New Orleans Square Station  Toontown Depot  and Tomorrowland Station  The Grand Circle Tour then concludes with a visit to the  Grand Canyon Primeval World  dioramas before returning passengers to Main Street  U S A  Disneyland Monorail System The original red Mark I ALWEG Monorail train  with one car added  and then designated Mark II  Both trains were created especially for Disneyland  The other train was identical  but blue color  Seen at the Disneyland Hotel station  in August  1963 The blue Mark II ALWEG Monorail train  Seen at the Disneyland Park station  in August  1963 Main article  Disneyland Monorail System One of Disneyland s signature attractions is its monorail service  which opened in Tomorrowland in 1959 as the first daily operating monorail train system in the Western Hemisphere  The monorail guideway has remained almost exactly the same since 1961  aside from small alterations while Indiana Jones Adventure was being built  Five generations of monorail trains have been used in the park  since their lightweight construction means they wear out quickly  The most recent operating generation  the Mark VII  was installed in 2008  The monorail shuttles visitors between two stations  one inside the park in Tomorrowland and one in Downtown Disney  It follows a 2 5 mile  4 km  long route designed to show the park from above  Currently  the Mark VII is running with the colors red  blue and orange  Monorail Red travels over the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage in Tomorrowland  The monorail was originally built with one station in Tomorrowland  Its track was extended and a second station opened at the Disneyland Hotel in 1961  With the creation of Downtown Disney in 2001  the new destination is Downtown Disney  instead of the Disneyland Hotel  The physical location of the monorail station did not change  but the original station building was demolished as part of the hotel downsizing  and the new station is now separated from the hotel by several Downtown Disney buildings  including ESPN Zone and the Rainforest Caf   Main Street vehicles Main Street at Disneyland as seen from a Horseless Carriage  All vehicles that are found on Main Street were designed to accurately reflect turn of the century vehicles  including a double decker bus  a horse drawn streetcar  a fire engine  and an automobile  They are available for one way rides along Main Street  U S A  The horseless carriages are modeled after cars built in 1903  They are two cylinder  four horsepower  3 kW  engines with manual transmission and steering  Walt Disney used to drive the fire engine around the park before it opened  on most mornings  It has also been used to host celebrity guests and used in the parades  Disneyland Helipad A Los Angeles Airways S 61L helicopter lifting off from the Disneyland heliport  August  1963  with the Matterhorn visible in the background From the late 1950s to 1968 Los Angeles Airways provided regularly scheduled helicopter passenger service between Disneyland and Los Angeles International Airport  LAX  and other cities in the area  The helicopters initially operated from Anaheim Disneyland Heliport  located behind Tomorrowland  Service later moved  in 1960  to a new heliport north of the Disneyland Hotel  20  Arriving guests were transported to the Disneyland Hotel via tram  The service ended after two fatal crashes in 1968  The crash in Paramount  California  on May 22  1968 killed 23  the worst helicopter accident in aviation history at that time   The second crash in Compton  California on August 14  1968  killed 21  21  Live entertainment In addition to the attractions  Disneyland provides live entertainment throughout the park  Most of the mentioned entertainment is not offered daily  but only on selected days of the week  or selected periods of the year  Characters Mickey Mouse greeting guests Many Disney characters can be found throughout the park  greeting visitors  interacting with children  and posing for photos  Some characters have specific areas where they are scheduled to appear  but can be found wandering as well  Some of the rarest are charecters like Rabbit from Winnie the Pooh   Max  Mushu  and Agent P  22  Periodically through recent decades  and most recently during the summers of 2005 and 2006   Mickey Mouse would climb the Matterhorn attraction several times a day with the support of Minnie  Goofy  and other performers  Other mountain climbers could also be seen on the Matterhorn from time to time  As of March 2007  Mickey and his  toon  friends no longer climb the Matterhorn but the climbing program continues  Daily ceremonies Every evening at dusk  there is a military style flag retreat to lower the Flag of the United States for the day  performed by a detail of the Disneyland Security Personnel  The ceremony usually is held between 4 and 5 pm  depending on the entertainment being offered on Main Street  USA  to prevent conflicts with crowds and music  Disney does report the time the Flag Retreat is scheduled on its Times Guide  offered at the entrance turnstiles and other locations  The Disneyland Band The Disneyland Band  which has been part of the park since its opening  plays the role of the Town Band on Main Street  U S A  It also breaks out into smaller groups like the Main Street Strawhatters  the Hook and Ladder Co   and the Pearly Band in Fantasyland  Fantasmic  Main article  Fantasmic  Fantasmic  finale as seen on July 4  2010 Fantasmic   which debuted in 1992  is a popular multimedia nighttime show on the Rivers of America  The star Mickey Mouse summons the characters and spirit of beloved Disney cartoons and uses the power of imagination to defeat the evil villains that try to turn his dream into a nightmare  The presentation is made at the Laffite s Tavern end of Pirate s Lair at Tom Sawyer Island and uses the Rivers of America as part of the stage  It uses Frontierland and New Orleans Square as the spectator arena  It consists of synchronized lighting and special effects  with floating barges  the Mark Twain Riverboat  the Sailing Ship Columbia  fountains  lasers  fireworks  thirty foot tall  mist screens  upon which animated scenes are projected  and an automated 45 foot fire breathing dragon  Fireworks Disneyland fireworks from Sleeping Beauty Castle Elaborate fireworks shows synchronized with Disney songs and often have appearances from Tinker Bell or Dumbo  flying in the sky above Sleeping Beauty Castle  Since 2000  presentations have become more elaborate  featuring new pyrotechnics  launch techniques and story lines  In 2004  Disneyland introduced a new air launch pyrotechnics system  reducing ground level smoke and noise and decreasing negative environmental impacts  At the time the technology debuted  Disney announced it would donate the patents to a non profit organization for use throughout the industry  23  Regular fireworks shows  1958 1999  Fantasy in the Sky 2000 2004

Independence Day Week  Disney s Celebrate America  A 4th of July Concert in the Sky Mickey s Halloween Party Exclusive  Halloween Screams Holiday  Believe    In Holiday Magic During the holiday season  there is a special fireworks presentation called Believe    In Holiday Magic  which has been running since 2000  except for a hiatus in 2005 during the park s 50th anniversary celebration  Scheduling of fireworks shows depends on the time of year  During the slower off season periods  the fireworks are only offered on weekends  During the busier times  Disney offers additional nights  The park offers fireworks nightly during its busy periods  which include Easter Spring Break  Summer and Christmas time  Disneyland spends about  41 000 per night on the fireworks show  The show is normally offered at 8 45 PM if the park is scheduled to close at 10 pm or later  but shows have started as early as 5 45 pm  A major consideration is weather winds  especially at higher elevations  which can force the cancellation of the show  The park will usually wait an additional 15 minutes or so to see if the winds die down  Shows  with a few minor exceptions  such as July 4 and New Year s Eve  must finish by 10 pm due to the conditions of the permit issued by the City of Anaheim  The Golden Horseshoe Revue The Golden Horseshoe Saloon offers a live stage show with an Old West feel  The Golden Horseshoe Revue was an American frontier themed vaudeville show starring Sluefoot Sue and Pecos Bill  It ran until the mid 1980s  when it was replaced by a similar show starring Lily Langtree  or Miss Lily  and Sam the Bartender  Most recently  Billy Hill and the Hillbillies have played their guitars and banjos in a bluegrass and comedy show  Additionally  in front of the Golden Horsehose Saloon  The Laughing Stock Co  enacts small humorous skits with an Old West theme  Parades Disneyland has featured a number of different parades traveling down the park s central Main Street   Fantasyland corridor  There have been daytime and nighttime parades that celebrated Disney films or seasonal holidays with characters  music  and large floats  One of the most popular parades was the Main Street Electrical Parade  which now resides at the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista  Florida  From May 5  2005 through November 7  2008  as part of the Disneyland s 50th Anniversary  Walt Disney s Parade of Dreams was presented  celebrating several of the classic Disney stories including The Lion King  The Little Mermaid  Alice in Wonderland  and Pinocchio  In 2009  Walt Disney s Parade of Dreams was replaced by Celebrate  A Street Party  which premiered on March 27  2009  Disney does not call Celebrate  A Street Party a parade  but rather a  street event   During the Christmas season  Disneyland presents  A Christmas Fantasy  Parade  Walt Disney s Parade of Dreams was replaced by Mickey s Soundsational Parade which debuted on May 27  2011  24  Tomorrowland Terrace The Tomorrowland Terrace is a stage in Tomorrowland  It is a two story stage where the lower stage rises from below floor level  It was popular in the 1960s with music performers of the day  Over the years  it was eventually replaced with Club Buzz  a Buzz Lightyear themed stage and show featuring the space character from the Toy Story films  In 2006  it was restored to the Tomorrowland Terrace with the same style and design as the original  It is now home to the Jedi Training Academy interactive stage show where children are chosen as Jedi padawan and taught how to use a lightsaber  Each child then has the opportunity to face Star Wars antagonists Darth Vader or Darth Maul  Also  local bands have returned to play in the evenings  just as Tomorrowland Terrace hosted in the 1960s  Other performers Alice  along with other characters from her movie  host  Disneyland Musical Chairs  at Coca Cola Refreshment Corner  accompanied by a ragtime pianist  Various other unscheduled street

Attendance of Disneyland Park Tickets From Disneyland s opening day until 1982  the price of the attractions was in addition to the price of park admission  32  Park goers paid a small admission fee to get into the park  but admission to most of the rides and attractions required guests to purchase a book of tickets that consisted of several coupons  initially labeled  A  through  C   The coupons were also sold individually   A  coupons allowed admission to the smaller rides and attractions such as the vehicles on Main Street  whereas  C  coupons were used for the most common attractions like the Peter Pan ride  or the Tea Cups  As more thrilling rides were introduced  such as the Monorail or the Matterhorn bobsled   D  and then eventually  E  coupons were introduced  Coupons could be combined to equal the equivalent of another ticket  e g  two  A  tickets equal one  B  ticket   From the thrill ride experience at Disneyland  the colloquial expression  an E ticket ride  is used to describe any exceptionally thrilling experience  Disneyland ticket book circa 1975 1977  The tickets are actually printed as  coupons   Later Disneyland featured a  Keys to the Kingdom  booklet of tickets  which consisted of 10 unvalued coupons sold for a single flat rate  These coupons could be used for any attraction regardless of its regular value  Obviously it would behoove the buyer to use these for the most thrilling attractions or rides  In 1982 Disney dropped the idea for individual ride tickets to a single admission price with unlimited access to all attractions   except shooting galleries   33  While this idea was not original to Disney  its business advantages were obvious  in addition to guaranteeing that everyone paid a large sum even if they stayed for only a few hours and rode only a few rides  the park no longer had to print tickets or ticket books  staff ticket booths  or provide staff to collect tickets or monitor attractions for people sneaking on without tickets  Later  Disney introduced other entry options such as multi day passes  Annual Passes  which allow unlimited entry to the Park for an annual fee   and Southern California residents  discounts

Main article  Incidents at Disneyland Resort Since the park s opening in July 1955  there have been numerous accidents  injuries  and deaths at Disneyland  Closures Disneyland Park has had three unscheduled closures since it opened in 1955  In 1963  following President John F  Kennedy s assassination  35  In 1994 for inspection after the 1994 Northridge earthquake  Both Disneyland and Disney California Adventure Park were closed following the September 11 attacks  Unlike Disney World  where the parks had already opened for the day and were closed while already in operation  the Disneyland Resort theme parks never opened  the parks were not scheduled to open for several more hours  due to the time difference   36  Additionally  Disneyland has had numerous planned closures  In the early years  the park was often scheduled to be closed on Mondays and Tuesdays during the off season  37  This was in conjunction with nearby Knott s Berry Farm  which closed on Wednesdays and Thursdays to keep costs down for both parks  while offering Orange County visitors a place to go 7 days a week  On May 4  2005 for the 50th Anniversary Celebration media event  38  The park has closed early to accommodate various special events  such as special press events  tour groups  VIP groups  private parties  etc  It is also common for a corporation to rent the entire park for the evening  In such cases special passes are issued  which are good for admission to all rides and attractions  At the ticket booths and on published schedules  regular guests are notified of the early closures  In the late afternoon  cast members announce that the park is closing  then clear the park of everyone without the special passes  Holiday promotions Halloween Time Every year in October  Disneyland has a Halloween promotion when parts of the park are decorated in a Halloween theme  Space Mountain and the Haunted Mansion are temporarily rethemed as part of the promotion  Holidays at the Disneyland Resort From early November until the first few days in January  the park is decorated for the holidays  Seasonal entertainment includes the Believe    In Holiday Magic firework show and A Christmas Fantasy Parade  and the Haunted Mansion and It s a Small World are temporarily redecorated in a holiday theme  The Sleeping Beauty castle is also known to become snow capped and decorated with colorful lights during the holidays as well  See also Disney portal Southern California portal Walt Disney Parks and Resorts List of Disney attractions List of current Disneyland attractions List of
