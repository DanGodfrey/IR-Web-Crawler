Pre Columbian era From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Simple map of subsistence methods in the Americas at 1000 BCE    hunter gatherers  Mesolithic    simple farming societies  Neolithic    complex farming societies  tribal chiefdoms or civilizations  The pre Columbian era incorporates all period subdivisions in the history and prehistory of the Americas before the appearance of significant European influences on the American continents  spanning the time of the original settlement in the Upper Paleolithic period to European colonization during the Early Modern period  While the phrase  pre Columbian era  literally refers only to the time preceding Christopher Columbus s voyages of 1492  in practice the phrase usually is used to denote the entire history of American indigenous cultures until those cultures were conquered or significantly influenced by Europeans  even if this happened decades or centuries after Columbus s first landing  For this reason the alternative terms of Pre Colonial Americas or Prehistoric Americas are also in use  Many pre Columbian civilizations established hallmarks which included permanent settlements  cities  agriculture  civic and monumental architecture  major earthworks  and complex societal hierarchies  Some of these civilizations had long faded by the time of the first permanent European arrivals  c  late 15th early 16th centuries   and are known only through archaeological investigations  Others were contemporary with the colonial period  and were described in historical accounts of the time  A few  such as the Maya  had their own written records  Because most Christian Europeans of the time viewed such texts as heretical  they destroyed many texts in pyres  Only a few hidden documents have survived  giving modern historians glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge  Where they persist  the societies and cultures that descended from these civilizations may now be substantively different in form from those of earlier ones  Many of these peoples and their descendants maintain various traditions and practices which relate to the earlier times  as well as combining them with more recently adopted ones  Contents 1 History 1 1 Asiatic migration 1 2 North America 1 2 1 Middle Archaic period 1 2 2 Late Archaic period 1 2 3 Woodland period 1 2 4 Mississippian culture 1 3 Historic

entered the Americas via the Bering Land Bridge  Beringia   now the Bering Strait and possibly along the Northwest coast  Genetic evidence found in Amerindians  maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA  mtDNA  supports the theory of multiple genetic populations migrating from Asia  1  2  Over the course of millennia  Paleo Indians spread throughout North America and South America  Exactly when the first group of people migrated into the Americas is the subject of much debate  One of the earliest identifiable cultures was the Clovis culture  with sites dating from some 13 000 years ago  However  older sites dating back to 20 000 years ago have been claimed  Some genetic studies estimate the colonization of the Americas dates from between 40 000 to 13 000 years ago  3  The chronology of migration models is currently divided into two general approaches  The first is the short chronology theory with the first movement beyond Alaska into the New World occurring no earlier than 14 000   17 000 years ago  followed by successive waves of immigrants  4  5  6  7  The second belief is the long chronology theory  which proposes that the first group of people entered the hemisphere at a much earlier date  possibly 50 000   40 000 years ago or earlier  8  9  10  11  Artifacts have been found in both North and South America which have been dated to 14 000 BP  12  and humans are thought to have reached Cape Horn at the southern tip of South America by this time  The Inuit and related peoples arrived separately and at a much later date  probably during the first millennium AD  moving across the ice from Siberia into Alaska   edit  North America Main articles  Aboriginal peoples in Canada History  Native Americans in the United States History  and Pre Columbian Mexico See also  List of archaeological periods  North America  After the migration or migrations  it was several thousand years before the first complex civilizations arose  at the earliest emerging 5000 BCE  The inhabitants of the Americas were hunter gatherers  Even after the emergence of advanced civilizations  hunter gatherers inhabited most of the continents  area until the 18th century  Within this timeframe  roughly pertaining to the Paleo Indian Period  the Archaic Period  the Early Woodland Period  the Middle Woodland Period and the Late Woodland Period  numerous archaeological cultures have been identified  Early Paleoamericans soon spread throughout the Americas  diversifying into many hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes  13  Paleo Indian adaptation across North America was likely characterized by small  highly mobile bands consisting of approximately 20 to 50 members of an extended family  These groups moved from place to place as preferred resources were depleted and new supplies were sought  14  Paleo Indian groups were efficient hunters and carried a variety of tools  These included highly efficient projectile points knives  PP Ks  of the types mentioned above ambiguous   as well as less distinctive implements used for butchering and hide processing  During much of the Paleo Indian period  bands are thought to have subsisted primarily through hunting now extinct megafauna such as mastodon and bison antiquus  15  The North American climate finally stabilized by 8000 BCE  climatic conditions were very similar to today s  16  This led to widespread migration  cultivation and subsequently a dramatic rise in population all over the Americas  16  Over the course of thousands of years  American indigenous peoples domesticated  bred and cultivated a large array of plant species  These species now constitute 50 60  of all crops in cultivation worldwide  17  Due to the vastness and variety of the climates  ecology  vegetation  fauna  and landforms  ancient peoples migrated and coalesced separately into numerous separate peoples of distinct linguistic and cultural groups  18  According to the oral histories of many of the indigenous peoples of the Americas  they have been living there since their genesis  described by a wide range of traditional creation stories   edit  Middle Archaic period As early as 6500 BCE  people in the Lower Mississippi Valley at the Monte Sano site were building complex earthwork mounds to express their religious ceremonies and cosmology  This is the earliest dated mound of numerous sites of mound complexes found in present day Louisiana  Mississippi and Florida  from thousands of years before the construction of pyramids in Egypt  Since the late twentieth century  archeologists have explored and dated these sites  They have found that they were built by hunter gatherer societies  whose people occupied the sites on a seasonal basis  and who had not yet developed ceramics  Watson Brake  a large complex of eleven platform mounds  was constructed beginning in 3400 BCE and added to over 500 years  This has changed earlier assumptions that complex construction arose only after societies had adopted agriculture  become sedentary  often developed stratified hierarchy  and generally also developed ceramics  These ancient people had organized to build complex mound projects from a different basis   edit  Late Archaic period Poverty Point  1500 BCE Until the accurate dating of Watson Brake and similar sites  the oldest mound complex was thought to be Poverty Point  also located in the Lower Mississippi Valley  Built about 1500 BCE  it is the centerpiece of a culture extending over 100 sites on both sides of the Mississippi  The Poverty Point site has earthworks in the form of six concentric half circles  divided by radial aisles  together with some mounds  The entire complex is nearly a mile across  Mound building was continued by succeeding cultures  who built numerous sites in the middle Mississippi and Ohio River valleys as well  adding effigy mounds  conical and ridge mounds and other shapes   edit  Woodland period Main article  Woodland period Hopewell mounds from the Mound City Group in Ohio The Woodland period of North American pre Columbian cultures refers to the time period from roughly 1000 BCE to 1000 CE in the eastern part of North America  The term  Woodland  was coined in the 1930s and refers to prehistoric sites between the Archaic period and the Mississippian cultures  The Adena culture and the ensuing Hopewell tradition during this period built monumental earthwork architecture and established continent spanning trade and exchange networks  This period is considered a developmental stage without any massive changes in a short period  but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools  leather working  textile manufacture  tool production  cultivation  and shelter construction  Some Woodland peoples continued to use spears and atlatls until the end of the period  when they were replaced by bows and arrows   edit  Mississippian culture Main article  Mississippian Culture Mississippian site in Arkansas  Parkin Site  circa 1539  Illustration by Herb Roe  The Mississippian culture was spread across the Southeast and Midwest from the Atlantic coast to the edge of the plains  from the Gulf of Mexico to the Upper Midwest  although most intensively in the area along the Mississippi River and Ohio River  One of the distinguishing features of this culture was the construction of complexes of large earthen mounds and grand plazas  continuing the moundbuilding traditions of earlier cultures  They grew maize and other crops intensively  participated in an extensive trade network  and had a complex stratified society  The Mississippians first appeared around 1000 CE  following and developing out of the less agriculturally intensive and less centralized Woodland period  The largest urban site of this people  Cahokia   located near modern East St  Louis  Illinois   may have reached a population of over 20 000  Other chiefdoms were constructed throughout the Southeast  and its trade networks reached to the Great Lakes and Gulf of Mexico  At its peak  between the 12th and 13th centuries  Cahokia was the most populous city in North America  and was not surpassed by European American cities in population until 1800  Larger cities were constructed in Mesoamerica and South America  Monk s Mound  the major ceremonial center of Cahokia  remains the largest earthen construction of the prehistoric New World  The culture reached its peak in c  1200 1400  and in most places  it seems to have been in decline before the arrival of the Europeans  Many Mississippian groups were encountered by the Hernando de Soto Expedition of the 1540s  mostly with disastrous results for both sides  Unlike the Spanish expeditions in Mesoamerica  who conquered vast empires with relatively few men  the de Soto expedition wandered the American Southeast for four years  becoming more bedraggled  losing more men and equipment  and eventually arriving in Mexico as a fraction of its original size  The local people fared much worse though  as the fatalities of diseases introduced by the expedition devastated the populations and produced much social disruption  By the time Europeans returned a hundred years later  nearly all of the Mississippian groups had vanished  and vast swaths of their territory were virtually uninhabited  19   edit  Historic tribes When the Europeans arrived  many natives of North America were semi nomadic tribes of hunter gatherers  others were sedentary and agricultural civilizations  Many formed new tribes or confederations in response to European colonization  Some well known groups included by region  Northeast and mid Atlantic  the Huron  Delaware  Algonquin  Wampanoag  Mohegan  Iroquois  which included Mohawk  Oneida  Seneca  Cayuga  Onondaga and later the Tuscarora tribe   Erie  Southeast  Powhatan  Yamasee  Algonquian tribes  Siouan speaking tribes  Cherokee  Choctaw  Chickasaw  Muskogee  Seminole Midwest  Shawnee  Miami  Kansa  Ponca Great Plains  Sioux  Lakota and Dakota   Omaha  Cheyenne  Osage  Mandan  Missouri Southwest  Apache  Comanche  Hopi  Navajo Northwest  Modoc  Klamath  Paiute  Shoshone  Idaho  Haida Alaska  Inuit and Alaska Natives  Although not as technologically advanced as the Mesoamerican civilizations further south  there were extensive pre Columbian sedentary societies  such as the Hopi and Navajo  in what is now the United States of America  The Iroquois League of Nations or  People of the Long House  was a politically advanced and unique social structure which is thought by some historians to have influenced the United States Constitution  20  21  with the Senate passing a resolution to this effect in 1988  22  Other historians have contested this interpretation and believe the impact was minimal  or did not exist  pointing to numerous differences between the two systems and the ample precedents for the Constitution in European political thought  23  24  25   edit  Mesoamerica Further information  Mesoamerican chronology One of the pyramids in the upper level of Yaxchil n Atlantes at Tula  Hidalgo Mesoamerica is the region extending from central Mexico south to the northwestern border of Costa Rica that gave rise to a group of stratified  culturally related agrarian civilizations spanning an approximately 3 000 year period before the European discovery of the New World by Christopher Columbus  Mesoamerican is the adjective generally used to refer to that group of pre Columbian cultures  This refers to an environmental area occupied by an assortment of ancient cultures that shared religious beliefs  art  architecture  and technology in the Americas for more than three thousand years  Between 2000 and 300 BCE  complex cultures began to form in Mesoamerica  Some matured into advanced pre Columbian Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Olmec  Teotihuacan  Maya  Zapotec  Mixtec  Huastec  Purepecha  Toltec  and Mexica  also known as the Aztecs  an incorrect name coined in the 1900s by Alexander von Humboltd  The  Aztecs  were actually known as the Triple Alliance  since they were three smaller kingdoms loosely united together  26   page needed   which flourished for nearly 3 500 years before first contact with Europeans  These indigenous civilizations are credited with many inventions in  building pyramid temples  mathematics  astronomy  medicine  writing  highly accurate calendars  fine arts  intensive agriculture  engineering  an abacus calculator  and complex theology  They also invented the wheel  but it was used solely as a toy  They also used native copper  silver and gold for metalworking  in which they used very advanced methods  Archaic inscriptions on rocks and rock walls all over northern Mexico  especially in the state of Nuevo Le n  demonstrate an early propensity for counting in Mexico  Their number system was base 20 and included zero  These very early and ancient count markings were associated with astronomical events and underscore the influence that astronomical activities had upon Mexican natives before the arrival of Europeans  In fact  many of the later Mexican based civilizations carefully built their cities and ceremonial centers according to specific astronomical events  The biggest Mesoamerican cities such as Teotihuacan  Tenochtitlan  and Cholula were among the largest in the world  These cities grew as centers of commerce  ideas  ceremonies  and theology  and they radiated influence outwards onto neighboring cultures in central Mexico  While many city states  kingdoms  and empires competed with one another for power and prestige  Mesoamerica can be said to have had five major civilizations  The Olmec  Teotihuacan  the Toltec  the Mexica and the Maya  These civilizations  with the exception of the politically fragmented Maya  extended their reach across Mexico and beyond like no others  They consolidated power and distributed influence in matters of trade  art  politics  technology  and theology  Other regional power players made economic and political alliances with these four civilizations over the span of 4 000 years  Many made war with them  but almost all peoples found themselves within these five spheres of influence   edit  Olmec civilization Main article  Olmec The earliest known civilization is the Olmec  This civilization established the cultural blueprint by which all succeeding indigenous civilizations would follow in Mexico  Pre Olmec civilization began with the production of pottery in abundance  around 2300 BCE in the Grijalva River delta  Between 1600 and 1500 BCE  the Olmec civilization had begun  with the consolidation of power at their capital  a site today known as San Lorenzo Tenochtitl n near the coast in southeast Veracruz  27  The Olmec influence extended across Mexico  into Central America  and along the Gulf of Mexico  They transformed many peoples  thinking toward a new way of government  pyramid temples  writing  astronomy  art  mathematics  economics  and religion  Their achievements paved the way for the greatness of the Maya civilization in the east and the civilizations to the west in central Mexico   edit  Teotihuacan civilization Main article  Teotihuacan The decline of the Olmec resulted in a power vacuum in Mexico  Emerging from that vacuum was Teotihuacan  first settled in 300 BCE  By 150 CE  Teotihuacan had risen to become the first true metropolis of what is now called North America  Teotihuacan established a new economic and political order never before seen in Mexico  Its influence stretched across Mexico into Central America  founding new dynasties in the Maya cities of Tikal  Copan  and Kaminaljuy   Teotihuacan s influence over the Maya civilization cannot be understated  it transformed political power  artistic depictions  and the nature of economics  Within the city of Teotihuacan was a diverse and cosmopolitan population  Most of the regional ethnicities of Mexico were represented in the city  such as Zapotecs from the Oaxaca region  They lived in apartment communities where they worked their trades and contributed to the city s economic and cultural prowess  By 500 CE  Teotihuacan had become the largest city in the world  Teotihuacan s economic pull impacted areas in northern Mexico as well  It was a city whose monumental architecture reflected a monumental new era in Mexican civilization  declining in political power about 650 CE but lasting in cultural influence for the better part of a millennium  to around 950 CE  Maya architecture at Uxmal  edit  Maya civilization Main article  Maya civilization Contemporary with Teotihuacan s greatness was the greatness of the Maya civilization  The period between 250 CE and 650 CE was a time of intense flourishing of Maya civilized accomplishments  While the many Maya city states never achieved political unity on the order of the central Mexican civilizations  they exerted a tremendous intellectual influence upon Mexico and Central America  The Maya built some of the most elaborate cities on the continent  and made innovations in mathematics  astronomy  and calendrics  The Mayans also evolved the only true writing system native to the Americas using pictographs and syllabic elements in the form of texts and codices inscribed on stone  pottery  wood  or highly perishable books made from bark paper   edit  Aztec Mexica Triple Alliance civilization Main article  Aztec With the decline of the Toltec civilization came political fragmentation in the Valley of Mexico  Into this new political game of contenders to the Toltec throne stepped outsiders  the Mexica  They were also a desert people  one of seven groups who formerly called themselves  Azteca   in memory of Aztl n  but they changed their name after years of migrating  Since they were not from the Valley of Mexico  they were initially seen as crude and unrefined in the ways of Nahua civilization  Through political maneuvers and ferocious fighting skills  they managed to become the rulers of Mexico as the head of the  Triple Alliance   which included two other  Aztec  cities  Texcoco and Tlacopan   Latecomers to Mexico s central plateau  the Mexica thought of themselves  nevertheless  as heirs of the civilizations that had preceded them  For them  arts  sculpture  architecture  engraving  feather mosiac work  and the calendar  were because of the former inhabitants of Tula  the Toltecs  The Mexica Aztecs were the rulers of much of central Mexico by about 1400  while Yaquis  Coras and Apaches commanded sizable regions of northern desert   having subjugated most of the other regional states by the 1470s  At their peak  300 000 Mexica citation needed  presided

plains  and coasts were the home of tens of millions of people  Some groups formed permanent settlements  Among those groups were the Chibchas  or  Muiscas  or  Muyscas    Valdivia and the Tairona  The Chibchas of Colombia  Valdivia of Ecuador  the Quechuas of Peru  and the Aymara of Bolivia were the four most important sedentary Amerindian groups in South America  The theory of pre Columbian contact across the South Pacific Ocean between South America and Polynesia has received support from several lines of evidence  although solid confirmation remains elusive  A diffusion by human agents has been put forward to explain the pre Columbian presence in Oceania of several cultivated plant species native to South America  such as the bottle gourd  Lagenaria siceraria  or sweet potato  Ipomoea batatas   Direct archaeological evidence for such pre Columbian contacts and transport has been lacking  however  A 2007 paper published in PNAS put forward DNA and archaeological evidence that domesticated chickens had been introduced into South America via Polynesia by late pre Columbian times  28  These findings were challenged by a later study published in the same journal  that cast doubt on the dating calibration used and presented alternative mtDNA analyses that disagreed with a Polynesian genetic origin  29  The origin and dating remains an open issue  Whether or not early Polynesian American exchanges occurred  there are no discernible human genetic  archaeological  cultural or linguistic legacies of that contact   edit  Norte Chico or Caral Main article  Norte Chico civilization The ancient city of Caral On the north central coast of present day Peru  Norte Chico or Caral  as known in Peru  was a civilization that emerged around 3000 BCE  contemporary with urbanism s rise in Mesopotamia   It is considered one of the six cradles of civilization in the world  It had a cluster of large scale urban settlements of which the Sacred City of Caral  in the Supe valley  is one of the largest and best studied sites  Norte Chico or Caral is the oldest known civilization in the Americas and persisted until around 1800 BCE   edit  Valdivia Main article  Valdivia Culture The Valdivia culture was concentrated on the coast of Ecuador  Their existence was recently discovered by archeological findings  Their culture is the oldest in the Americas  spanning from 3500 to 1800 BCE  The Valdivia lived in a community of houses built in a circle or oval around a central plaza  They were sedentary people who lived off farming and fishing  though occasionally they hunted for deer  From the remains that have been found  scholars have determined that Valdivians cultivated maize  kidney beans  squash  cassava  hot peppers  and cotton plants  the last of which was used to make clothing  Valdivian pottery initially was rough and practical  but it became showy  delicate  and big over time  They generally used red and gray colors  and the polished dark red pottery is characteristic of the Valdivia period  In its ceramics and stone works  the Valdivia culture shows a progression from the most simple to much more complicated works   edit  Ca aris Main article  Ca aris The Ca ari were the indigenous natives of today s Ecuadorian provinces of Ca ar and Azuay  They were an elaborate civilization with advanced architecture and complex religious beliefs  The Inca destroyed and burned most of their remains  The Ca ari s old city was replaced twice  first by the Incan city of Tomipamba  and later by the colonial city of Cuenca  The city was also believed to be the site of El Dorado  the city of gold from the mythology of Colombia   see Cuenca  The Ca ari were most notable for having repelled the Incan invasion with fierce resistance for many years until they fell to Tupac Yupanqui  Many of their descendants are still present in Ca ar  The majority did not mix with the colonists or become Mestizos  Larco Museum houses the largest private collection of pre Columbian art  Lima  Peru   edit  Chav n Main article  Chav n culture The Chav n  a South American preliterate civilization  established a trade network and developed agriculture by 900 BCE  according to some estimates and archeological finds  Artifacts were found at a site called Chav n in modern Peru at an elevation of 3 177 meters  The Chav n civilization spanned from 900 to 300 BCE   edit  Chibchas Main article  Chibcha The Chibcha linguistic communities were the most numerous  the most territorially extended and the most socio economically developed of the pre Hispanic Colombians  By the 3rd century  the Chibchas had established their civilization in the northern Andes  At one point  the Chibchas occupied part of what is now Panama  and the high plains of the Eastern Sierra of Colombia  The areas which they occupied in Colombia were the present day Departments of Santander  North and South   Boyac  and Cundinamarca  This is where the first farms and industries were developed  It is also where the independence movement originated  They are currently the richest areas in Colombia  The Chibcha developed the most populous zone between the Mayan and Inca empires  Next to the Quechua of Peru and the Aymara in Bolivia  the Chibcha of the eastern and north eastern Highlands of Colombia developed the most notable culture among the sedentary indigenous peoples in South America  In the Oriental Andes  the Chibcha comprised several tribes who spoke the same language  Chibchan   They included the following  the Muisca  Guane  Lache  Cof n  and Chitarero   edit  Moche Main article  Moche The Moche thrived on the north coast of Peru approximately 1 500 2 000 years ago  The heritage of the Moche is seen in their elaborate burials  Some were recently excavated by UCLA s Christopher B  Donnan in association with the National Geographic Society  As skilled artisans  the Moche were a technologically advanced people  They traded with distant peoples such as the Maya  What has been learned about the Moche is based on study of their ceramic pottery  the carvings reveal details of their daily lives  The Larco Museum of Lima  Peru has an extensive collection of such ceramics  They show that the people practiced human sacrifice  had blood drinking rituals  and that their religion incorporated non procreative sexual practices  such as fellatio    edit  Inca Empire Main article  Inca Empire Holding their capital at the great cougar shaped city of Cuzco  the Inca civilization dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533  Known as Tawantinsuyu  or  the land of the four regions   in Quechua  the Inca civilization was highly distinct and developed  Inca rule extended to nearly a hundred linguistic or ethnic communities  some 9 to 14 million people connected by a 25 000 kilometer road system  Cities were built with precise  unmatched stonework  constructed over many levels of mountain terrain  Terrace farming was a useful form of agriculture  There is evidence of excellent metalwork and even successful brain surgery in Inca civilization    The template below  Wide image  is being considered for merging  See templates for discussion to help

Brazil s Amazon valley  The Cambeba were a populous  organized society in the late Pre Columbian era whose population suffered steep decline in the early years of the Columbian Exchange  The Spanish explorer Francisco de Orellana traversed the Amazon River during 16th Century and reported densely populated regions running hundreds of kilometers along the river  These populations left no lasting monuments  possibly because they used local wood as their construction material as stone was not locally available  While it is possible Orellana may have exaggerated the level of development among the Amazonians  their semi nomadic descendants have the odd distinction among tribal indigenous societies of a hereditary  yet landless  aristocracy  Archaeological evidence has revealed the continued presence of semi domesticated orchards  as well as vast areas of land enriched with terra preta  Both of these discoveries  along with Cambeba ceramics discovered within the same archaeological levels suggest that a large and organized civilization existed in the area  30   edit  Agricultural development See also  Columbian Exchange and Pre Columbian engineering in the Americas Early inhabitants of the Americas developed agriculture  developing and breeding maize  corn  from ears 2 5 cm in length to the current size we are familiar with today  Potatoes  tomatoes  tomatillos  a husked green tomato   pumpkins  chili peppers  squash  beans  pineapple  sweet potatoes  the grains quinoa and amaranth  cocoa beans  vanilla  onion  peanuts  strawberries  raspberries  blueberries  blackberries  papaya  and avocados were among other plants grown by natives  Over two thirds of all types of food crops grown worldwide are native to the Americas  The natives began using fire in a widespread manner  Intentional burning of vegetation was taken up to mimic the effects of natural fires that tended to clear forest understories  thereby making travel easier and facilitating the growth of herbs and berry producing plants that were important for both food and medicines  This created the Pre Columbian savannas of North America  31  While not as widespread as in other areas of the world  Asia  Africa  Europe   native Americans did have livestock  In Mexico as well as Central America  natives had domesticated deer which was used for meat and possibly even milk  Andean societies had llamas and alpacas for the same reasons  as well as for beasts of burden  Guinea pigs were raised for meat in the Andes  Iguanas were another source of meat in Mexico  Central  and northern South America  Domesticated turkeys were common in Central America and in some regions of North America  they were valued for their meat  feathers  and  possibly  though less likely   eggs  There is documentation of Central Americans utilizing hairless dogs  especially the Xoloitzcuintle breed  for their meat  By the 15th century  maize had been transmitted from Mexico and was being farmed in the Mississippi embayment  as far as the East Coast of the United States  and as far north as southern Canada  Potatoes were utilized by the Inca  and chocolate was used by the Aztec   edit  Genetics Schematic illustration of maternal  mtDNA  gene flow in and out of Beringia  from 25 000 years ago to present  Main article  Indigenous Amerindian genetics The haplogroup most commonly associated with Indigenous Amerindian genetics is Haplogroup Q1a3a  Y DNA   32  Y DNA  like mtDNA  differs from other nuclear chromosomes in that the majority of the Y chromosome is unique and does not recombine during meiosis  This has the effect that the historical pattern of mutations can easily be studied  33  The pattern indicates Indigenous Amerindians experienced two very distinctive genetic episodes  first with the initial peopling of the Americas  and secondly with European colonization of the Americas  3  34  The former is the determinant factor for the number of gene lineages and founding haplotypes present in today s Indigenous Amerindian populations  34  Human settlement of the New World occurred in stages from the Bering sea coast line  with an initial 20 000 year layover on Beringia for the founding population  35  36  The micro satellite diversity and distributions of the Y lineage specific to South America indicates that certain Amerindian populations have been isolated since the initial colonization of the region   37  The Na Den   Inuit and Indigenous Alaskan populations exhibit haplogroup Q  Y DNA  mutations  however are distinct from other indigenous Amerindians with various mtDNA mutations  38  39  40  This suggests that the earliest migrants into the northern extremes of North America and Greenland derived from later populations  41   edit  See

11 21   Haplogroups are defined by unique mutation events such as single nucleotide polymorphisms  or SNPs  These SNPs mark the branch of a haplogroup  and indicate that all descendents of that haplogroup at one time shared a common ancestor  The Y DNA SNP mutations were passed from father to son over thousands of years  Over time  additional SNPs occur within a haplogroup  leading to new lineages  These new lineages are considered subclades of the haplogroup  Each time a new mutation occurs  there is a new branch in the haplogroup  and therefore a new subclade  Haplogroup Q  possibly the youngest of the 20 Y chromosome haplogroups  originated with the SNP mutation M242 in a man from Haplogroup P that likely lived in Siberia approximately 15 000 to 20 000 years before present
