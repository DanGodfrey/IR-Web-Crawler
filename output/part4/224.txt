SD US SD Website www sd gov South Dakota  i  sa   d  ko t    is a state located in the Midwestern region of the United States  It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux American Indian tribes  South Dakota is the 17th most extensive  but the 5th least populous and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States  Once the southern portion of the Dakota Territory  South Dakota became a state on November 2  1889  Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls  with a population of nearly 160 000  is South Dakota s largest city  South Dakota is bordered by the states of North Dakota  Minnesota  Iowa  Nebraska  Wyoming  and Montana  The state is bisected by the Missouri River  dividing South Dakota into two geographically and socially distinct halves  known to residents as  East River  and  West River   7  Eastern South Dakota is home to most of the state s population  and fertile soil in this area is used to grow a variety of crops  West of the Missouri  ranching is the predominant agricultural activity  and the economy is more dependent on tourism and defense spending  The Black Hills  a group of low pine covered mountains  is located in the southwest part of the state  The Black Hills are sacred to the Sioux  Mount Rushmore  a major tourist destination  is located there  Other attractions in the southwest include Badlands and Wind Cave national parks  Custer State Park  the Crazy Horse Memorial  and historic Deadwood  South Dakota experiences a temperate continental climate  with four distinct seasons and precipitation ranging from moderate in the east to semi arid in the west  The ecology of the state features species typical of a North American grassland biome  Humans have inhabited the area for several millennia  with the Sioux becoming dominant by the early 19th century  In the late 19th century  European American settlement intensified after a gold rush in the Black Hills and the construction of railroads from the east  Encroaching miners and settlers caused conflict that triggered a number of Indian Wars  ending with the Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890  Key events in the 20th century included the Dust Bowl and Great Depression  increased federal spending during the 1940s and 50s for agriculture and defense  and an industrialization of agriculture which has much reduced family farming  While several Democratic senators have represented South Dakota for multiple terms at the federal level  the state government is largely dominated by the Republican Party  whose nominees have carried South Dakota in each of the most recent eleven presidential elections  Historically dominated by an agricultural economy and a rural lifestyle  South Dakota has recently sought to diversify its economy to attract and retain residents  South Dakota s history and rural character still strongly influence the culture of the state  Contents 1 Geography 1 1 Regions and geology 1 2 Ecology 1 3 Climate 1 4 National Parks and Monuments 2 History 3

central United States  and is considered a part of the Midwest by the U S  Census Bureau  8  it is also part of the Great Plains region  The culture  economy  and geography of western South Dakota have more in common with the West than the Midwest  7  9  South Dakota has a total land area of 77 121 square miles  199 740 km2   making the state the 17th largest in the Union  2 Harney Peak  with an elevation of 7 242 ft  2 207 m   is the state s highest point  while the shoreline of Big Stone Lake is the lowest  with an elevation of 966 ft  294 m   10  South Dakota is bordered to the north by North Dakota  to the south by Nebraska  to the east by Iowa and Minnesota  and to the west by Wyoming and Montana  The geographical center of the U S  is 17 miles  27 km  west of Castle Rock in Butte County  10  The North American continental pole of inaccessibility is located between Allen and Kyle  1 024 mi  1 648 km  from the nearest coastline  11  The Missouri River is the largest and longest river in the state  Other major South Dakota rivers include the Cheyenne  James  Big Sioux  and White Rivers  Eastern South Dakota has many natural lakes  mostly created by periods of glaciation  12  Additionally  dams on the Missouri River create four large reservoirs  Lake Oahe  Lake Sharpe  Lake Francis Case  and Lewis and Clark Lake   edit  Regions and geology Much of western South Dakota is covered by grasslands and features buttes such as Thunder Butte  shown above  South Dakota can generally be divided into three regions  eastern South Dakota  western South Dakota  and the Black Hills  13  The Missouri River serves as a boundary in terms of geographic  social  and political differences between eastern and western South Dakota  and the geography of the Black Hills differs from its surroundings to such an extent that it can be considered separate from the rest of western South Dakota  South Dakotans also at times combine the Black Hills with the rest of western South Dakota  and refer to the two resulting regions  divided by the Missouri  as West River and East River  7  9  Eastern South Dakota generally features higher precipitation and lower topography than the western part of the state  Smaller geographic regions of this area include the Coteau des Prairies  the Dissected Till Plains  and the James River Valley  The Coteau des Prairies is a plateau bordered on the east by the Minnesota River Valley and on the west by the James River Basin  14  Further to the west  the James River Basin is mostly low  flat  highly eroded land  following the flow of the James River through South Dakota from north to south  15  The Dissected Till Plains  an area of rolling hills and fertile soil that covers much of Iowa and Nebraska  also extends into the southeastern corner of South Dakota  Layers deposited during the Pleistocene epoch  starting around two million years ago  cover most of eastern South Dakota  16  These are the youngest rock and sediment layers in the state  and are the product of several successive periods of glaciation which deposited a large amount of rocks and soil  known as till  over the area  17  The Black Hills  a low mountain range  is located in southwestern South Dakota  The Great Plains cover most of the western two thirds of South Dakota  West of the Missouri River the landscape becomes more arid and rugged  consisting of rolling hills  plains  ravines  and steep flat topped hills called buttes  18  In the south  east of the Black Hills  lie the South Dakota Badlands  Erosion from the Black Hills  marine skeletons which fell to the bottom of a large shallow sea that once covered the area and volcanic material all contribute to the geology of this area  16  19  20  The Black Hills are in the southwestern part of South Dakota and extend into Wyoming  This range of low mountains covers 6 000 sq mi  16 000 km2  with peaks that rise from 2 000 to 4 000 feet  600 to 1 200 m  above their bases  The Black Hills are the location of Harney Peak  7 242 ft or 2 207 m above sea level   the highest point in South Dakota and also the highest point in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains  10  Two billion year old Precambrian formations  the oldest rocks in the state  form the central core of the Black Hills  16  21  Formations from the Paleozoic Era form the outer ring of the Black Hills  22  these were created between roughly 540 and 250 million years ago  This area features rocks such as limestone which were deposited here when the area formed the shoreline of an ancient inland sea  22   edit  Ecology A pronghorn in Wind Cave National Park Much of South Dakota  not including the Black Hills  is dominated by a temperate grasslands biome  23  Although grasses and crops cover most of this region  deciduous trees such as cottonwoods  elms  and willows are common near rivers and in shelter belts  24 Mammals in this area include bison  deer  pronghorn  coyotes  and prairie dogs  25  The state bird  the ring necked pheasant  has adapted well to the area after being introduced from China  26  and growing populations of bald eagles are spread throughout the state  especially near the Missouri River  27  Rivers and lakes of the grasslands support populations of walleye  carp  pike  bass  and other species  25  The Missouri River also contains the pre historic paddlefish  28  Because of higher elevation and precipitation  the Black Hills ecology differs significantly from that of the plains  29  The mountains are thickly blanketed by various types of pines  including ponderosa and lodgepole pines  as well as spruces  30  Black Hills mammals include deer  elk  wapiti   bighorn sheep  mountain goats  and mountain lions  while the streams and lakes contain several species of trout  30  31  32  33   edit  Climate South Dakota has a continental climate with four distinct seasons  ranging from cold  dry winters to hot and semi humid summers  During the summers  the average high temperature throughout the state is often close to 90  F  32  C   although it cools to near 60  F  15  C  at night  It is not unusual for South Dakota to have severe hot  dry spells in the summer with the temperature climbing above 100  F  38  C  several times every year  34  Winters are cold with January high temperatures averaging below freezing and low temperatures averaging below 10  F    12  C  in most of the state  The highest recorded temperature is 120  F  49  C  at Usta on July 15  2006 35  and the lowest recorded temperature is  58  F   50  C  at McIntosh on February 17  1936  36  Average annual precipitation in South Dakota ranges from semi arid conditions in the northwestern part of the state  around 15 inches  or 381 mm  to semi humid around the southeast portion of the state  around 25 inches  or 635 mm   34  although a small area centered on Lead in the Black Hills has the highest precipitation at nearly 30 inches  762 mm  a year  37  South Dakota summers bring frequent  sometimes severe  thunderstorms with high winds  thunder  and hail  The eastern part of the state is often considered part of Tornado Alley  38  and South Dakota experiences an average of 30 tornadoes each year  39  Severe weather in the form of blizzards and ice storms occur often during winter  Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various South Dakota cities in degrees Fahrenheit  and

Parks and Monuments Mount Rushmore National Memorial in the Black Hills South Dakota contains several sites that are administered by the National Park Service  Two national parks have been established in South Dakota  both located in the southwestern part of the state  Wind Cave National Park  established in 1903 in the Black Hills  contains an extensive cave network as well as a large herd of bison  41 Badlands National Park was created in 1978  42  The park features an eroded  brightly colored landscape surrounded by semi arid grasslands  43 Mount Rushmore National Memorial in the Black Hills was established in 1925  The sculpture of four U S  Presidents was carved into the mountainside by sculptor Gutzon Borglum  44  Other areas managed by the National Park Service include Jewel Cave National Monument near Custer  the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail  the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site  which features a decommissioned nuclear missile silo and a separate missile control area located several miles away  and the Missouri National Recreational River  45  The Crazy Horse Memorial is a large mountainside sculpture near Mt  Rushmore that is being constructed with private funds  46   edit  History Main article  History of South Dakota Humans have lived in what is today South Dakota for at least several thousand years  The first inhabitants were Paleoindian hunter gatherers  and disappeared from the area around 5000 BC  47  Between 500 AD and 800 AD  a semi nomadic people known as the Mound Builders lived in central and eastern South Dakota  In the 14th century  the Crow Creek Massacre occurred  in which several hundred men  women  and children were killed near the Missouri River  48  By 1500 the Arikara  or Ree  had settled in much of the Missouri River valley  49  European contact with the area began in 1743  when the LaVerendrye brothers explored the region  The LaVerendrye group buried a plate near the site of modern day Pierre  claiming the region for France as part of greater Louisiana  50  By the early 19th century  the Sioux had largely replaced the Arikara as the dominant group in the area  51  In 1803  the United States purchased the Louisiana Territory  an area that included most of South Dakota  from Napoleon Bonaparte  and President Thomas Jefferson organized a group commonly referred to as the  Lewis and Clark Expedition  to explore the newly acquired region  52  In 1817  an American fur trading post was set up at present day Fort Pierre  beginning continuous American settlement of the area  53  In 1855  the U S  Army bought Fort Pierre but abandoned it the following year in favor of Fort Randall to the south  53  Settlement by Americans and Europeans was by this time increasing rapidly  and in 1858 the Yankton Sioux signed the 1858 Treaty  ceding most of present day eastern South Dakota to the United States  54  Deadwood  like many other Black Hills towns  was founded after the discovery of gold  Land speculators founded two of eastern South Dakota s largest present day cities  Sioux Falls in 1856 55  and Yankton in 1859  56  In 1861  the Dakota Territory was established by the United States government  this initially included North Dakota  South Dakota  and parts of Montana and Wyoming   57  Settlement of the area  mostly by people from the eastern United States as well as western and northern Europe  increased rapidly  58  especially after the completion of an eastern railway link to Yankton in 1873  59  In 1874 gold was discovered in the Black Hills during a military expedition led by George A  Custer 60  61  and miners and explorers began illegally entering land promised to the Lakota  Custer s expedition took place despite the fact that the US had granted the entire western half of present day South Dakota  West River  to the Sioux in 1868 by the Treaty of Laramie as part of the Great Sioux Reservation  The Sioux declined to grant mining rights or land in the Black Hills  and war broke out after the U S  failed to stop white miners and settlers from entering the region  Eventually the US defeated the Sioux and broke up the Great Sioux Reservation into five reservations  settling the Lakota in those areas  53   In 1980  the US Supreme Court and Congress ordered payment to the Lakota for the illegal seizure of the Black Hills  The case remains unsettled  as the Lakota refuse to accept the money and instead insist on the return of the land   62  A growing population caused Dakota Territory to be divided in half and President Benjamin Harrison signed proclamations formally admitting both South Dakota and North Dakota to the union on November 2  1889  63  64  Harrison had the papers shuffled to obscure which one was signed first and the order went unrecorded  64  On December 29  1890  the Wounded Knee Massacre occurred on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation  Commonly cited as the last major armed conflict between the United States and the Lakota Sioux Nation  the massacre resulted in the deaths of at least 146 Sioux  many of them women and children  65  31 U S  soldiers were also killed in the conflict  65  A South Dakota farm during the Dust Bowl  1936 During the 1930s  several economic and climatic conditions combined with disastrous results for South Dakota  A lack of rainfall  extremely high temperatures and inappropriate cultivation techniques produced what was known as the Dust Bowl in South Dakota and several other plains states  Fertile topsoil was blown away in massive dust storms  and several harvests were completely ruined  66  The experiences of the Dust Bowl  coupled with local bank foreclosures and the general economic effects of the Great Depression  resulted in many South Dakotans leaving the state  The population of South Dakota declined by more than 7  between 1930 and 1940  67  Economic stability returned with the U S  entry into World War II in 1941  when demand for the state s agricultural and industrial products grew as the nation mobilized for war  68  In 1944  the Pick Sloan Plan was passed as part of the Flood Control Act of 1944 by the U S  Congress  resulting in the construction of six large dams on the Missouri River  four of which are at least partially located in South Dakota  69  Flood control  hydroelectricity  and recreational opportunities such as boating and fishing are provided by the dams and their reservoirs  69  In recent decades  South Dakota has transformed from a state dominated by agriculture to one with a more diversified economy  The tourism industry has grown considerably since the completion of the interstate system in the 1960s  with the Black Hills becoming more important as a destination  The financial service industry began to grow in the state as well  with Citibank moving its credit card operations from New York to Sioux Falls in 1981  a move that has since been followed by several other financial companies  South Dakota was the first state to eliminate caps on interest rates  70  In 2007  the site of the recently closed Homestake gold mine near Lead was chosen as the location of a new underground research facility  71  Despite a growing state population and recent economic development  many rural areas have been struggling over the past 50 years with locally declining populations and the emigration of educated young adults to larger South Dakota cities  such as Rapid City or Sioux Falls  or to other states  72  Mechanization and consolidation of agriculture has contributed greatly to the declining number of smaller family farms and the resulting economic and demographic challenges facing rural towns  73   edit  Demographics Main article  Demographics of South Dakota South Dakota Population Density Map Historical populations

Bureau estimates that the population of South Dakota was 824 082 on July 1  2011  a 1 22  increase since the 2010 United States Census  3  According to the U S  Census Bureau  as of 2009  South Dakota has an estimated population of 814 383  an increase of 59 336  or 7 9   since the year 2000  74  7 3  of South Dakota s population was reported as under 5  24  under 18  and 14 3  were 65 or older  74  Females made up approximately 50 2  of the population  74  As of the 2000 census  South Dakota ranked fifth lowest in the nation in both population and population density  The center of population of South Dakota is located in Buffalo County  in the unincorporated county seat of Gannvalley  75   edit  Race and ethnicity At the 2010 Census  84 7  of the population was non Hispanic White  8 5  non Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native  1 2  non Hispanic Black or African American  0 9  non Hispanic Asian  0 1  from some other race  non Hispanic  and 1 8  of two or more races  non Hispanic   2 7  of South Dakota s population was of Hispanic  Latino  or Spanish origin  they may be of any race   The five largest ancestry groups in South Dakota are German  40 7    Norwegian  15 3    Irish  10 4    Native American  8 3    and English  7 1    76  German Americans are the largest ancestry group in most parts of the state  especially in East River  east of the Missouri River   although there are also large Scandinavian descended populations in some counties  South Dakota has the nation s largest population of Hutterites  77  a communal Anabaptist group which emigrated from Europe in 1874  South Dakota has seven large Indian reservations  shown in pink   American Indians  largely Lakota  Dakota  and Nakota  Sioux  are predominant in several counties and comprise 20 per cent of the population in West River  There are seven large Indian reservations in the state  but this area is diminished from the Great Sioux Reservation of West River  which the US government had once allocated to the Sioux  South Dakota has the third highest proportion of Native Americans of any state  behind Alaska and New Mexico  78  Five of the state s counties are wholly within Indian reservations  79  Living standards on many South Dakota reservations are often far below the national average  Ziebach County ranked as the poorest county in the nation in 2009  80  The unemployment rate in Fort Thompson  on the Crow Creek Indian Reservation  is 70   and 21  of households lack plumbing or basic kitchen appliances  81  A 1995 study by the U S  Census Bureau found that 58  of homes on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation did not have a telephone  82  English is specified by law as the  common language  of the state  1  As of the 2000 census  1 90  of the population aged 5 or older speak German at home  while 1 51  speak Lakota or Dakota  and 1 43  Spanish  83   edit  Growth and rural flight South Dakota  in common with other Great Plains states  has been experiencing a falling population in many rural areas over the last several decades  a phenomenon known as  rural flight  as family farming has decreased  This trend has continued in recent years  with 30 of South Dakota s counties losing population between the 1990 and the 2000 census  84  During that time  nine counties experienced a population loss of greater than 10   with Harding County  in the northwest corner of the state  losing nearly 19  of its population  84  Low birth rates and a lack of younger immigration has caused the median age of many of these counties to increase  In 24 counties  at least 20  of the population is over the age of 65  85  compared with a national rate of 12 8   74  The effect of rural flight has not been spread evenly through South Dakota  however  Although most rural counties and small towns have lost population  the Sioux Falls area  the larger counties along Interstate 29  the Black Hills  and many Indian reservations have all gained population  84 Lincoln County near Sioux Falls is the ninth fastest growing county  by percentage  in the United States  86  The growth in these areas has compensated for losses in the rest of the state  84  and South Dakota s total population continues to increase steadily  albeit at a slower rate than the national average  74   edit  Religion The largest denominations by number of adherents in 2000 were the Roman Catholic Church with 181 434 members  the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America  ELCA  with 121 871 members  and the United Methodist Church  UMC  with 37 280 members  87   Both the ELCA and UMC are specific denominations within the broader terms  Lutheran  and  Methodist   respectively   The results of a 2001 survey  in which South Dakotans were asked to identify their religion  include  88  Protestant  61   Lutheran  27   Methodist  13   Baptist  4   Presbyterian  4   Other Protestant  6   Non denominational Christian  7   Roman Catholic  25   Not religious  8   Other religions  3   Refused to

of 2010  the fifth smallest total state output in the US  89  The per capita personal income was  38 865 in 2010  ranked 25th in the U S   90  and 12 5  of the population was below the poverty line in 2008  91  CNBC s list of  Top States for Business for 2010  has recognized South Dakota as the seventh best state in the nation  92  In July 2011  the state s unemployment rate was 4 7   93  The service industry is the largest economic contributor in South Dakota  This sector includes the retail  finance  and health care industries  Citibank  which was the largest bank holding company in the United States at one time  established national banking operations in South Dakota in 1981 to take advantage of favorable banking regulations  70  Government spending is another important segment of the state s economy  providing over ten percent of the gross state product  Ellsworth Air Force Base  near Rapid City  is the second largest single employer in the state  94  Ethanol plant in Turner County Agriculture has historically been a key component of the South Dakota economy  Although other industries have expanded rapidly in recent decades  agricultural production is still very important to the state s economy  especially in rural areas  The five most valuable agricultural products in South Dakota are cattle  corn  maize   soybeans  wheat  and hogs  95  Agriculture related industries such as meat packing and ethanol production also have a considerable economic impact on the state  South Dakota is the sixth leading ethanol producing state in the nation  96  Another important sector in South Dakota s economy is tourism  Many travel to view the attractions of the state  particularly those in the Black Hills region  such as historic Deadwood  Mount Rushmore  and the nearby state and national parks  One of the largest tourist events in the state is the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally  The five day event drew over 450 000 attendants in 2006  significant considering the state has a population of only 790 000  97  In 2006  tourism provided an estimated 33 000 jobs in the state and contributed over two billion dollars to the economy of South Dakota  98   edit  State taxes As of 2005  South Dakota has the lowest per capita total state tax rate in the United States  99  The state does not levy personal or corporate income taxes  100 inheritance taxes  101  or taxes on intangible personal property  The state sales tax rate is 4 percent  102  Various localities have local levies so that in some areas the rate is 6 percent  The state sales tax does not apply to sales to Indians on Indian reservations  but many reservations have a compact with the state  Businesses on the reservation collect the tax and the state refunds to the Indian Tribes the percentage of sales tax collections relating to the ratio of Indian population to total population in the county or area affected  Ad valorem property taxes are local taxes and are a large source of funding for school systems  counties  municipalities and other local government units  The South Dakota Special Tax Division regulates some taxes including cigarette and alcohol related taxes  103   edit  Transportation Main article  Transportation in South Dakota See also  List of South Dakota railroads and List of South Dakota numbered highways Beaver Creek Bridge in Wind Cave National Park  South Dakota has 83 609
