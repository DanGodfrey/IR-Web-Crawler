November 1953  is an English writer primarily known for his work in comic books  a medium where he has produced a number of critically acclaimed and popular series  including Watchmen  V for Vendetta  and From Hell  5  Frequently described as the best graphic novel writer in history  6  p10  7  p7  he has also been described as  one of the most important British writers of the last fifty years   8  He has occasionally used such pseudonyms as Curt Vile  Jill de Ray  and Translucia Baboon  Moore started out writing for British underground and alternative fanzines in the late 1970s before achieving success publishing comic strips in such magazines as 2000AD and Warrior  He was subsequently picked up by the American DC Comics  and as  the first comics writer living in Britain to do prominent work in America   7  p7  he worked on big name characters such as Batman  Batman  The Killing Joke  and Superman  Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow    substantially developed the minor character Swamp Thing  and penned original titles such as Watchmen  During that decade  Moore helped to bring about greater social respectability for the medium in the United States and United Kingdom  7  p11  and has subsequently been attributed with the development of the term  graphic novel  over  comic book   9  In the late 1980s and early 1990s he left the comic industry mainstream and went independent for a while  working on experimental work such as the epic From Hell  pornographic Lost Girls  and the prose novel Voice of the Fire  He subsequently returned to the mainstream later in the 1990s  working for Image comics  before developing America s Best Comics  an imprint through which he published works such as The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and the occult based Promethea  Moore is a Neopagan  occultist  ceremonial magician  vegetarian and anarchist and has featured such themes in works including Promethea  From Hell and V for Vendetta  as well as performing avant garde spoken word occult  workings  with The Moon and Serpent Grand Egyptian Theatre of Marvels  some of which have been released on CD  Despite his own personal objection to them  his books have provided the basis for a number of Hollywood films  including From Hell  2001   The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  2003   V for Vendetta  2005  and Watchmen  2009   Moore has also been referenced in popular culture  and has been recognised as an influence on a variety of literary and television figures including Neil Gaiman  10  pp16 18 Joss Whedon  4  and Damon Lindelof  4  Contents 1 Biography 1 1

Moore was born on 18 November 1953  at St  Edmond s Hospital in Northampton  Northamptonshire  England  to a working class family whom he believed had lived in the town for several generations  6  p11  He subsequently grew up in a part of Northampton known as The Boroughs  a poverty stricken area with a lack of facilities and high levels of illiteracy  but he nonetheless  loved it  I loved the people  I loved the community and  I didn t know that there was anything else   6  pp13 16  He lived in his house with his parents  brewery worker Ernest Moore  and printer Sylvia Doreen  along with his younger brother Mike and his maternal grandmother  6  p14  He  read omnivorously  from the age of five  getting books out of the local library  and subsequently attended Spring Lane Primary School  6  p17  At the same time  he began reading comic strips  initially British strips  such as Topper and The Beezer  but eventually also American imports such as Flash  Detective Comics  Fantastic Four  and Blackhawk  6  p31  He later passed his eleven plus exam  and was therefore eligible to go to Northampton Grammar School  11  where he first came into contact with people who were middle class and better educated  and he was shocked at how he went from being one of the top pupils at his primary school to one of the lowest in the class at secondary  Subsequently disliking school and having  no interest in academic study   he believed that there was a  covert curriculum  being taught that was designed to indoctrinate children with  punctuality  obedience and the acceptance of monotony   6  pp17 18   LSD was an incredible experience  Not that I m recommending it for anybody else  but for me it kind of   it hammered home to me that reality was not a fixed thing  That the reality that we saw about us every day was one reality  and a valid one   but that there were others  different perspectives where different things have meaning that were just as valid  That had a profound effect on me   Alan Moore  2003  6  pp19 20  In the late 1960s Moore began publishing his own poetry and essays in fanzines  eventually setting up his own fanzine  Embryo  Through Embryo  Moore became involved in a group known as the Arts Lab  The Arts Lab subsequently made significant contributions to the magazine   6  pp33 34  He began dealing the hallucinogenic LSD at school  being expelled for doing so in 1970   he later described himself as  one of the world s most inept LSD dealers   12  The headmaster of the school subsequently  got in touch with various other academic establishments that I d applied to and told them not to accept me because I was a danger to the moral well being of the rest of the students there  which was possibly true   6  p18  Whilst continuing to live in his parents  home for a few more years  he moved through various jobs  including cleaning toilets and working in a tannery  Around 1971  he met and began a relationship with a Northampton born girl named Phyllis  with whom he moved into  a little one room flat in the Barrack Road area in Northampton   Soon marrying  they moved into a new council estate in the town s eastern district whilst he worked in an office for a sub contractor of the local gas board  However  he felt that he was not being fulfilled by this job  and so decided to try to earn a living doing something more artistic  6  pp34 35   edit  Early career  1978 1980 Abandoning his office job  he decided to instead take up both writing and illustrating his own comics  He had already produced a couple of strips for several alternative fanzines and magazines  such as Anon E  Mouse for the local paper Anon  and St  Pancras Panda  a parody of Paddington Bear  for the Oxford based Back Street Bugle  7  pp16 17  His first paid work was for a few drawings that were printed in NME music magazine  and not long after he succeeded in getting a series about a private detective known as Roscoe Moscow published using the pseudonym of Curt Vile  a pun on the name of composer Kurt Weill  in the weekly music magazine Sounds  earning  35 a week  Alongside this  he and Phyllis  along with their newly born daughter Leah  began claiming unemployment benefit to supplement this income  6  p36  Not long after this  in 1979 he also began publishing a new comic strip known as Maxwell the Magic Cat in the Northants Post  under the pseudonym of Jill de Ray  a pun on the Medieval child murderer Gilles de Rais  something he found to be a  sardonic joke    Earning a further  10 a week from this  he decided to sign off of social security  and would continue writing Maxwell the Magic Cat until 1986  6  pp36 37  Moore has stated that he would have been happy to continue Maxwell s adventures almost indefinitely  but ended the strip after the newspaper ran a negative editorial on the place of homosexuals in the community  13  Meanwhile  Moore decided to focus more fully on writing comics rather than both writing and drawing them  stating that  After I d been doing  it  for a couple of years  I realised that I would never be able to draw well enough and or quickly enough to actually make any kind of decent living as an artist   14  p15  To learn more about how to write a successful comic book script  he asked advice from his friend  comic book writer Steve Moore  whom he had known since he was fourteen  14  p20  Interested in writing for 2000AD  one of Britain s most prominent comic magazines  Alan Moore then submitted a script for their long running and successful series Judge Dredd  Whilst having no need for another writer on Judge Dredd  which was already being written by John Wagner  2000AD s editor Alan Grant saw promise in Moore s work   later remarking that  this guy s a really fucking good writer  15    and instead asked him to write some short stories for the publication s Future Shocks series instead  While the first few were rejected  Grant advised Moore on improvements  and eventually accepted the first of many  Meanwhile  Moore had also begun writing minor stories for Doctor Who Weekly  and later commented that  I really  really wanted a regular strip  I didn t want to do short stories  But that wasn t what was being offered  I was being offered short four or five page stories where everything had to be done in those five pages  And  looking back  it was the best possible education that I could have had in how to construct a story   14  pp21 22   edit  Marvel UK  2000AD  and Warrior  1980 1984 From 1980 through to 1984  Moore maintained his status as a freelance writer  and was offered a spate of work by a variety of comic book companies in Britain  namely Marvel UK  and the publishers of 2000AD and Warrior  He later remarked that  I remember that what was generally happening was that everybody wanted to give me work  for fear that I would just be given other work by their rivals  So everybody was offering me things   6  p57  It was an era when comic books were increasing in popularity in Britain  and according to Lance Parkin   the British comics scene was cohering as never before  and it was clear that the audience was sticking with the title as they grew up  Comics were no longer just for very small boys  teenagers   even A level and university students   were reading them now   7  p20  During this three year period  2000AD would accept and publish over fifty of Moore s one off stories for their Future Shocks and Time Twisters science fiction series  15  The editors at the magazine were impressed by Moore s work and decided to offer him a more permanent strip  starting with a story that they wanted to be vaguely based upon the hit film E T  the Extra Terrestrial  The result  Skizz  which was illustrated by Jim Baikie  told the story of the titular alien who crashes to Earth and is cared for by a woman named Roxy  and Moore later noted that in his opinion  this work  owes far too much to Alan Bleasdale   16  p94  Another series he produced for 2000AD was D R  and Quinch  which was illustrated by Alan Davis  The story  which Moore described as  continuing the tradition of Dennis the Menace  but giving him a thermonuclear capacity   16  p99  revolved around two delinquent aliens  and was a science fiction take on National Lampoon s characters O C  and Stiggs  However  the work widely considered to be the highlight of his 2000AD career  16  pp100 110  and that he himself described as  the one that worked best for me  6  p58  was The Ballad of Halo Jones  the first series in the magazine to be based around a female character  which Moore did deliberately  16  pp99 102  Co created with artist Ian Gibson  the series was set in the 50th century  It finished before all the episodes were written  Another comic company to employ Moore was Marvel UK  who had formerly purchased a few of his one off stories for Doctor Who Weekly and Star Wars Weekly  Aiming to get an older audience than 2000AD  their main rival  they employed Moore to write for the regular strip Captain Britain   halfway through a storyline that he s neither inaugurated nor completely understood   17  He replaced the former writer Dave Thorpe  but maintained the original artist  Alan Davis  who Moore described as  an artist whose love for the medium and whose sheer exultation upon finding himself gainfully employed within it shine from every line  every new costume design  each nuance of expression   17  The third comic company that Moore worked for in this period was a new monthly magazine known as Warrior  founded by Dez Skinn  a former editor of both IPC  publishers of 2000 AD  and Marvel UK  that was designed to offer writers a greater degree of freedom over their artistic creations than was allowed by pre existing companies  and it was at Warrior that Moore  would start to reach his potential   7  p21  Moore was initially given two ongoing strips in Warrior  Marvelman and V for Vendetta  both of which debuted in Warrior s first issue in March 1982  V for Vendetta was a dystopian thriller set in a future 1997 where a fascist government controlled Britain  opposed only by a lone anarchist dressed in a Guy Fawkes costume who turns to terrorism to topple the government  Illustrated by David Lloyd  Moore was influenced by his pessimistic feelings about the Thatcherite Conservative government  which he projected forward as a fascist state in which all ethnic and sexual minorities had been eliminated  It has been regarded as  among Moore s best work  and has maintained a cult following throughout subsequent decades  7  p22  Marvelman  later retitled Miracleman for legal reasons  was a series that originally had been published in Britain from 1954 through to 1964  based largely upon the American comic Captain Marvel  Upon resurrecting Marvelman  Moore  took a kitsch children s character and placed him within the real world of 1982   7  p23  The work was drawn primarily by Garry Leach and Alan Davis  18  The third series that Moore produced for Warrior was The Bojeffries Saga  a comedy about a working class English family of vampires and werewolves  drawn by Steve Parkhouse  Warrior closed before these stories were completed  19  20  21  but under new publishers both Miracleman and V for Vendetta were resumed by Moore  who finished both stories by 1989  Moore s biographer Lance Parkin remarked that  reading them through together throws up some interesting contrasts   in one the hero fights a fascist dictatorship based in London  in the other an Aryan superman imposes one   7  p26  Although Moore s work numbered amongst the most popular strips to appear in 2000 AD  Moore himself became increasingly concerned at the lack of creator s rights in British comics  16  pp105 106  In 1985  he talked to fanzine Arkensword  noting that he had stopped working for all British publishers bar IPC   purely for the reason that IPC so far have avoided lying to me  cheating me or generally treating me like shit   22  23  He did  however  join other creators in decrying the wholesale relinquishing of all rights  and in 1986 stopped writing for 2000 AD  leaving mooted future volumes of the Halo Jones story unstarted  16  pp110 111  Moore s outspoken opinions and principles  particularly on the subject of creator s rights and ownership  would see him burn bridges with a number of other publishers over the course of his career  22  23  Meanwhile  during this same period  he   using the pseudonym of Translucia Baboon   became involved in the music scene  founding his own band  The Sinister Ducks  with David J  of goth band Bauhaus  and Alex Green  and in 1983 released a single  March of the Sinister Ducks  with sleeve art by illustrator Kevin O Neill  In 1984  Moore and David J also released a 12 inch single featuring a recording of  This Vicious Cabaret   a song featured in V for Vendetta  which was released on the Glass Records label  7  p95  Moore would also write the song  Leopardman At C amp A  for David J  and it would be set to music by Mick Collins for the album We Have You Surrounded by Collins  group The Dirtbombs  24   edit  The American mainstream and DC Comics  1983 1988 Moore s British work brought him to the attention of DC Comics editor Len Wein  who hired him in 1983 to write Swamp Thing  then a formulaic and poor selling monster comic  Moore  along with artists Stephen R  Bissette  Rick Veitch  and John Totleben  deconstructed and reimagined the character  writing a series of formally experimental stories that addressed environmental and social issues alongside the horror and fantasy  bolstered by research into the culture of Louisiana  where the series was set  19  20  For Swamp Thing he revived many of DC s neglected magical and supernatural characters  including the Spectre  the Demon  the Phantom Stranger  Deadman  and others  and introduced John Constantine  an English working class magician based visually on the British musician Sting  which later became the protagonist of the series Hellblazer  the longest continuously published comic of DC s Vertigo imprint  Moore would continue writing Swamp Thing for about three years  from issue No  20  January 1984  through to issue No  64  September 1987  with the exception of issues No  59 and  62  7  p82  Moore s run on Swamp Thing was successful both critically and commercially  and inspired DC to recruit European and particularly British writers such as Grant Morrison  Jamie Delano  Peter Milligan  and Neil Gaiman to write comics in a similar vein  often involving radical revamps of obscure characters  19  20  These titles laid the foundation of what became the Vertigo line  Moore began producing further stories for DC Comics  including a two part story for Vigilante  which dealt with domestic abuse  He was eventually given the chance to write a story for one of DC s best known superheroes  Superman  entitled For the Man Who Has Everything  which was illustrated by Dave Gibbons and released in 1985  In this story  Wonder Woman  Batman  and Robin visit Superman on his birthday  only to find that he has been overcome by an alien organism and is hallucinating about his heart s desire  7  p37  He followed this with another Superman story  Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow   which was published in 1986  Illustrated by Curt Swan  it was designed as the last Superman story in the pre Crisis on Infinite Earths DC Universe  25  1988 saw the publication of a Batman story written by Moore and illustrated by Brian Bolland  Entitled The Killing Joke  it revolved around The Joker  who had escaped Arkham Asylum and gone on a killing spree  and Batman s effort to stop him  Despite being a key work in helping to redefine Batman as a character  26  along with Frank Miller s The Dark Knight Returns and Batman  Year One  Lance Parkin believed that  the theme isn t developed enough  and  it s a rare example of a Moore story where the art is better than the writing   7  pp38 39  something Moore himself acknowledges  6  p121  The limited series Watchmen  begun in 1986 and collected as a trade paperback in 1987  cemented Moore s reputation  Imagining what the world would be like if costumed heroes had really existed since the 1940s  Moore and artist Dave Gibbons created a Cold War mystery in which the shadow of nuclear war threatens the world  The heroes who are caught up in this escalating crisis either work for the U S  government or are outlawed  and are motivated to heroism by their various psychological hang ups  Watchmen is non linear and told from multiple points of view  and includes formal experiments such as the symmetrical design of issue 5   Fearful Symmetry   where the last page is a near mirror image of the first  the second last of the second  and so on  and in this manner is an early example of Moore s interest in the human perception of time and its implications for free will  It is the only comic to win the Hugo Award  in a one time category   Best Other Form    27  Indeed  it is widely seen as Moore s best work  and has been regularly described as the greatest comic book ever written  7  pp39 40  Alongside roughly contemporary works such as Frank Miller s Batman  The Dark Knight Returns  Art Spiegelman s Maus  and Jaime and Gilbert Hernandez s Love and Rockets  Watchmen was part of a late 1980s trend in American comics towards more adult sensibilities  28  Moore briefly became a media celebrity  and the resulting attention led to him withdrawing from fandom and no longer attending comics conventions  at one UKCAC in London he is said to have been followed into the toilet by eager autograph hunters   29  In 1987 Moore submitted a proposal for a miniseries called Twilight of the Superheroes  the title a twist on Richard Wagner s opera G tterd mmerung  meaning  Twilight of the Gods    The series was set in the future of the DC Universe  where the world is ruled by superheroic dynasties  including the House of Steel  presided over by Superman and Wonder Woman  and the House of Thunder  led by the Captain Marvel family   These two houses are about to unite through a dynastic marriage  their combined power potentially threatening freedom  and several characters  including John Constantine  attempt to stop it and free humanity from the power of superheroes  The series would also have restored the DC Universe s multiple earths  which had been eliminated in the continuity revising 1985 miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths  The series was never commissioned  but copies of Moore s detailed notes have appeared on the Internet and in print despite the efforts of DC  who consider the proposal their property  7  pp43 44  Similar elements  such as the concept of hypertime  have since appeared in DC comics  The 1996 miniseries Kingdom Come by Mark Waid and Alex Ross  was also set amid a superheroic conflict in the future of the DC universe  Waid and Ross have stated that they had read the Twilight proposal before starting work on their series  but that any similarities are both minor and unintended  21  Moore s relationship with DC Comics had gradually deteriorated over the issues of creator s rights and merchandising  Moore and Gibbons were not paid any royalties for a Watchmen spin off badge set  as DC defined them as a  promotional item   30  and according to certain reports  he and Gibbons gained only 2  of the profits earned by DC for Watchmen  7  p44  Meanwhile  a group of creators including Moore  Frank Miller  Marv Wolfman  and Howard Chaykin  fell out with DC over a proposed age rating system similar to those used for films  7  pp44 45  After completing V for Vendetta  which DC had already begun publishing  thus enabling him to finish the final few episodes  in 1989  Moore stopped working for DC   edit  Independent period and Mad Love  1988 1993 Abandoning DC Comics and the mainstream  Moore  along with his wife Phyllis and their mutual lover Deborah Delano  set up their own comics publishing company  which they named Mad Love  The works that they published in Mad Love turned away from the science fiction and superhero genres that Moore was used to writing  instead focusing on realism  ordinary people  and political causes  Mad Love s first publication  AARGH  Artists Against Rampant Government Homophobia   was an anthology of work by a number of writers  including Moore  that challenged the Thatcher government s recently introduced Clause 28  a law designed to prevent councils and schools  promoting homosexuality   Sales from the book went towards the Organisation of Lesbian and Gay Action  and Moore was  very pleased with  it  stating that  we hadn t prevented this bill from becoming law  but we had joined in the general uproar against it  which prevented it from ever becoming as viciously effective as its designers might have hoped   6  p149  31  Moore followed this with a second political work  Shadowplay  The Secret Team  a comic illustrated by Bill Sienkiewicz for Eclipse Comics and commissioned by the Christic Institute  which was included as a part of the anthology Brought to Light  a description of the CIA s covert drug smuggling and arms dealing  7  p47  After prompting by cartoonist and self publishing advocate Dave Sim  11  Moore then used Mad Love to publish his next project  Big Numbers  a proposed 12 issue series set in  a hardly disguised version of Moore s native Northampton  known as Hampton  and deals with the effects of big business on ordinary people and also with ideas of chaos theory  7  p48  Illustration of the comic was begun by Bill Sienkiewicz  who left the series after only two issues in 1990  and despite plans that his assistant  Al Columbia  would replace him  it never occurred and the series remained unfinished  7  pp48 49  32  Following this  in 1991 the company Victor Gollancz Ltd published Moore s A Small Killing  a full length story illustrated by Oscar Zarate  about a once idealistic advertising executive haunted by his boyhood self  According to Lance Parkin  A Small Killing is  quite possibly Moore s most underrated work   7  p49  Soon after this  Mad Love itself was disbanded as Phyllis and Deborah ended their relationship with Moore  taking with them much of the money that he had earned from his work in the 1980s  7  p25  Meanwhile  Moore also began producing work for Taboo  a small independent comic anthology edited by his former collaborator Stephen R  Bissette  The first of these was From Hell  a fictionalised account of the Jack the Ripper murders of the 1880s  Inspired by Douglas Adams  novel Dirk Gently s Holistic Detective Agency  33  Moore reasoned that to solve a crime holistically  one would need to solve the entire society it occurred in  and depicts the murders as a consequence of the politics and economics of the time  Just about every notable figure of the period is connected with the events in some way  including  Elephant Man  Joseph Merrick  Oscar Wilde  Native American writer Black Elk  William Morris  artist Walter Sickert  and Aleister Crowley  who makes a brief appearance as a young boy  Illustrated in a sooty pen and ink style by Eddie Campbell  From Hell took nearly ten years to complete  outlasting Taboo and going through two more publishers before being collected as a trade paperback by Eddie Campbell Comics  It was widely praised  with comics author Warren Ellis calling it  my all time favourite graphic novel   34  The other series that Moore began for Taboo was Lost Girls  which he described as a work of intelligent  pornography   35  Illustrated by Melinda Gebbie  whom Moore subsequently entered into a relationship with  it was set in 1913  where Alice from Alice in Wonderland  Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz and Wendy from Peter Pan   who are each of a different age and class   all meet in a European hotel and regale each other with tales of their sexual encounters  7  pp49 50  With the work  Moore wanted to attempt something innovative in comics  and believed that creating comics pornography was a way of achieving this  He remarked that  I had a lot of different ideas as to how it might be possible to do an up front sexual comic strip and to do it in a way that would remove a lot of what I saw were the problems with pornography in general  That it s mostly ugly  it s mostly boring  it s not inventive   it has no standards   6  pp154 155  Like From Hell  Lost Girls outlasted Taboo  and a few subsequent instalments were published erratically until the work was finished and a complete edition published in 2006  Meanwhile  Moore also set about writing a prose novel  eventually producing Voice of the Fire  which would be published in 1996  Unconventional in tone  the novel was a set of short stories about linked events in his hometown of Northampton through the centuries  from the Bronze Age to the present day  which combined to tell a larger story  7  p92   edit  Return to the mainstream and Image Comics  1993 1998 In 1993 Moore declared himself to be a ceremonial magician  The same year marked a move by Moore back to the mainstream comics industry and back to writing superhero comics  He did so through the Image Comics  widely known at the time for its flashy artistic style  graphic violence  and scantily clad large breasted women  something that horrified many of his fans  7  p55  His first work published by Image  an issue of the series Spawn  was soon followed by the creation of his own mini series  1963  which was  a pastiche of Jack Kirby stories drawn for Marvel in the sixties  with their rather overblown style  colourful characters and cosmic style   7  p56  According to Moore   after I d done the 1963 stuff I d become aware of how much the comic audience had changed while I d been away  since 1988   That all of a sudden it seemed that the bulk of the audience really wanted things that had almost no story  just lots of big  full page pin up sort of pieces of artwork  And I was genuinely interested to see if I could write a decent story for that market   6  p173  He subsequently set about writing what he saw as  better than average stories for 13 to 15 years olds   including three mini series based upon the Spawn series  Violator  Violator Badrock  and Spawn  Blood Feud  7  p56  In 1995  he was also given control of a regular monthly comic  Jim Lee s WildC A T S   starting from issue  21  which he would continue to write for fourteen issues  The series followed two groups of superheroes  one of whom are on a spaceship heading back to their home planet  and the others who are instead remaining on Earth  Moore s biographer Lance Parkin remarked critically of the series  feeling that it was one of Moore s worst  and that  you feel Moore should be better than this  It s not special   7  p56  Moore himself  who remarked that he took on the series   his only regular monthly comic series since Swamp Thing   largely because he liked Jim Lee  admitted that he was not entirely happy with the work  believing that he had catered too much to his conceptions of what the fans wanted rather than being innovative  6  p174  Next he took over Rob Liefeld s Supreme  about a character with many similarities with DC Comics  Superman  Instead of emphasising increased realism as he had done with earlier superhero comics he had taken over  Moore did the opposite  and began basing the series on the Silver Age Superman comics of the 1960s  introducing a female superhero Suprema  a super dog Radar  and a Kryptonite like material known as Supremium  in doing so harking back to the original  mythic  figure of the American superhero  Under Moore  Supreme would prove to be a critical and commercial success  announcing that he was back in the mainstream after several years of self imposed exile  7  pp59 60  When Rob Liefeld  one of Image s co founders  split from the publisher and formed his own company Awesome Entertainment  he hired Moore to create a new universe for the characters he had brought with him from Image  Moore s  solution was breathtaking and cocky   he created a long and distinguished history for these new characters  retro fitting a fake silver and gold age for them   Moore began writing comics for many of these characters  such as Glory and Youngblood  as well as a three part mini series known as Judgement Day to provide a basis for the Awesome Universe  7  pp60 61  However Moore was not satisfied with Liefeld  saying  I just got fed up with the unreliability of information that I get from him  that I didn t trust him  I didn t think that he was respecting the work and I found it hard to respect him  And also by then I was probably feeling that with the exception of Jim Lee  Jim Valentino   people like that   that a couple of the Image partners were seeming  to my eyes  to be less than gentlemen  They were seeming to be not necessarily the people I wanted to deal with   6  p175   edit  America s Best Comics  1999 2008 Main article  America s Best Comics Image partner Jim Lee offered to provide Moore with his own imprint  which would be under Lee s company WildStorm Productions  Moore named this imprint America s Best Comics  lining up a series of artists and writers to assist him in this venture  However  Lee soon sold WildStorm   including America s Best Comics   to DC Comics  and  Moore found himself back with a company he d vowed to never work with again   Lee and editor Scott Dunbier flew to England personally to reassure Moore that he would not be affected by the sale  and would not have to deal with DC directly  36  Moore decided that there were too many people involved to back out from the project  and so ABC was launched in early 1999  7  p62  The first series published by ABC was The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  which featured a variety of characters from Victorian adventure novels  such as H  Rider Haggard s Allan Quatermain  H  G  Wells  Invisible Man  Jules Verne s Captain Nemo  Robert Louis Stevenson s Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  and Wilhelmina Murray from Bram Stoker s Dracula  Illustrated by Kevin O Neill  the first volume of the series pitted the League against Professor Moriarty from the Sherlock Holmes books  the second  against the Martians from The War of the Worlds  A third volume entitled The Black Dossier was set in the 1950s  The series was well received  and Moore was pleased that an American audience was enjoying something he considered  perversely English   and that it was inspiring some readers to get interested in Victorian literature  6  p183  Another of Moore s ABC works was Tom Strong  a post modern superhero series  featured a hero inspired by characters pre dating Superman  such as Doc Savage and Tarzan  The character s drug induced longevity allowed Moore to include flashbacks to Strong s adventures throughout the 20th century  written and drawn in period styles  as a comment on the history of comics and pulp fiction  The primary artist was Chris Sprouse  Tom Strong bore many similarities to Moore s earlier work on Supreme  but according to Lance Parkin  was  more subtle   and was  ABC s most accessible comic   7  pp64 65  Moore s Top 10  a deadpan police procedural comedy set in a city called Neopolis where everyone  including the police  criminals  and civilians has super powers  costumes  and secret identities  was drawn by Gene Ha and Zander Cannon  7  pp65 66 71  The series ended after twelve issues  but has spawned four spin offs  a miniseries Smax  which was set in a fantasy realm and drawn by Cannon  Top 10  The Forty Niners  a prequel to the main Top Ten series drawn by Ha  7  p68  and two sequel miniseries  Top 10  Beyond the Farthest Precinct  which was written by Paul Di Filippo and drawn by Jerry Ordway  and Top 10  Season Two  written by Cannon and drawn by Ha  Moore s series Promethea  which told the story of a teenage girl  Sophie Bangs  who is possessed by an ancient pagan goddess  the titular Promethea  explored many occult themes  particularly the Qabalah and the concept of magic  with Moore stating that  I wanted to be able to do an occult comic that didn t portray the occult as a dark  scary place  because that s not my experience of it   Promethea was  more psychedelic  more sophisticated  more experimental  more ecstatic and exuberant   6  p188  Drawn by J H  Williams III  it has been described as  a personal statement  from Moore  being one of his most personal works  and that it encompasses  a belief system  a personal cosmology   7  p68  ABC Comics was also used to publish an anthology series  Tomorrow Stories  which featured a regular cast of characters such as Cobweb  First American  Greyshirt  Jack B  Quick  and Splash Brannigan  Tomorrow Stories was notable for being an anthology series  a medium that had largely died out in American comics at the time  7  p66  However  despite the assurances that DC Comics would not interfere with Moore and his work  they subsequently did so  angering him  Specifically  in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  5  an authentic vintage advertisement for a  Marvel  brand douche caused DC executive Paul Levitz to order the entire print run destroyed and reprinted with the advertisement amended to  Amaze   to avoid friction with DC s competitor Marvel Comics  37  A Cobweb story Moore wrote for Tomorrow Stories No  8 featuring references to L  Ron Hubbard  American occultist Jack Parsons  and the  Babalon Working   was blocked by DC Comics due to the subject matter  38  Ironically  it was later revealed that they had already published a version of the same event in their Paradox Press volume The Big Book of Conspiracies  In 2003  a documentary about him was made by Shadowsnake Films  titled The Mindscape of Alan Moore  which was later released on DVD  39   edit  Return to independence  2009 present With many of the stories he had planned for America s Best Comics brought to an end  and with his increasing dissatisfaction with how DC Comics were interfering with his work  he decided to once more pull out of the comics mainstream  Speaking to Bill Baker in 2005  he remarked that  I love the comics medium  I pretty much detest the comics industry  Give it another 15 months  I ll probably be pulling out of mainstream  commercial comics   14  p65  The only ABC title continued by Moore was The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  after cutting ties with DC he launched the new League saga  Volume III  Century  in a co publishing partnership of Top Shelf Productions and Knockabout Comics  the first part released in 2009  the second in 2011 and the third planned for 2012  In 2006  the complete edition of Lost Girls was published  as a slipcased set of three hardcover volumes  The same year Moore published an eight page article tracing out the history of pornography in which he argued that a society s vibrancy and success are related to its permissiveness in sexual matters  Decrying that the consumption of contemporary ubiquitous pornography was still widely considered shameful  he called for a new and more artistic pornography that could be openly discussed and would have a beneficial impact on society  40  41  He expanded on this for a 2009 book length essay entitled 25 000 years of Erotic Freedom  which was described by a reviewer as  a tremendously witty history lecture   a sort of Horrible Histories for grownups   42  In 2007 Moore appeared in animated form in an episode of The Simpsons   a show he is a fan of 43    entitled  Husbands and Knives   which aired on his fifty fourth birthday  In 2010 Moore began what he described as  the 21st century s first underground magazine   Titled Dodgem Logic  the bi monthly publication consists of work by a number of Northampton based authors and artists  as well as original contributions from Moore  44  45  In January 2011  the fourth and final issue of Moore s Neonomicon was released by Avatar Press  46  This horror mini series is set in the H  P  Lovecraft universe  and like its prequel The Courtyard  is illustrated by Jacen Burrows  Recently Moore has appeared live at music events collaborating with a number of different musicians  with a forthcoming appearance with Stephen O Malley confirmed for the ATP  I ll Be Your Mirror  music festival in London  A planned future project is an occult textbook known as The Moon and Serpent Bumper Book of Magic  written with Steve Moore  It will be published by Top Shelf in  the future   47  He is also currently working on a second novel  Jerusalem  which will again be set in Northampton  48  49  Both Alan Moore and David Lloyd have joined the Occupy Comics Kickstarter project  Moore is said to contribute a long form prose piece  possibly illustrated  50   edit  Work  edit  Themes In a number of his comics  where he was taking over from earlier writers  including Marvelman  Swamp Thing  and Supreme  he used the  familiar tactic of wiping out what had gone before  giving the hero amnesia and revealing that everything we d learned to that point was a lie   7  p58  In this manner he was largely able to start afresh with the character and their series and was not constrained by earlier canon  As a comics writer  Moore applies literary sensibilities to the mainstream of the medium as well as including challenging subject matter and adult themes  He brings a wide range of influences to his work  such as William S  Burroughs  1 Thomas Pynchon  Robert Anton Wilson and Iain Sinclair  51 New Wave science fiction writers like Michael Moorcock and horror writers like Clive Barker  52  Influences within comics include Will Eisner  Harvey Kurtzman  53 Jack Kirby 3  and Bryan Talbot  54  55  56   edit  Recognition and awards Moore s work in the comic book medium has been widely recognised by his peers and by critics  George Khoury asserted that  to call this free spirit the best writer in the history of comic books is an understatement  6  p10  whilst interviewer Steve Rose referred to him as  the Orson Welles of comics  who is  the undisputed high priest of the medium  whose every word is seized upon like a message from the ether  by comic book fans  57  Douglas Wolk observed   Moore has undisputably made it into the Hall of Fame  he s one of the pillars of English language comics  alongside Jack Kirby and Will Eisner and Harvey Kurtzman and not many others  He s also the grand exception in that hall  since the other pillars are artists   and more often than not  writer artists  Moore is a writer almost exclusively  though his hyper detailed scripts always play to the strengths of the artists he works with  That makes him the chief monkey wrench in comics author theory  The main reason that almost nobody s willing to say that a single cartoonist is categorically superior to a writer artist team is that such a rule would run smack into Moore s bibliography  In fact  a handful of cartoonists who almost always write the stories they draw have made exceptions for Moore   Jaime Hernandez  Mark Beyer and most memorably Eddie Campbell   58  p229  Moore signing an autograph  2006  Moore has won numerous Jack Kirby Awards during his career  including for Best Single Issue for Swamp Thing Annual No  2 in 1985 with John Totleben and Steve Bissette  for Best Continuing Series for Swamp Thing in 1985  1986 and 1987 with Totleben and Bissette  Best Writer for Swamp Thing in 1985 and 1986 and for Watchmen in 1987  and with Dave Gibbons for Best Finite Series and Best Writer Artist  Single or Team  for Watchmen in 1987  59  Moore has won multiple Eagle Awards  including virtually a  clean sweep  in 1986 for his work on Watchmen and Swamp Thing  Moore not only won  favourite writer in both the US and UK categories   but had his work win for favourite comic book  supporting character  and new title in the US  and character  continuing story and  character worthy of own title  in the UK  in which last category his works held all top three spots   60  Moore has been nominated for the Comics Buyer s Guide Fan Awards several times  winning for Favorite Writer in 1985  1986  1987  1999  and 2000  Also  he won the CBG Fan Award for Favorite Comic Book Story  Watchmen  in 1987 and Favorite Original Graphic Novel or Album  Batman  The Killing Joke with Brian Bolland  in 1988  61  He received the Harvey Award for Best Writer for 1988  for Watchmen   62  for 1995 and 1996  for From Hell   63  64  for 1999  for his body of work  including From Hell and Supreme   65  for 2000  for The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen   66  and for 2001 and 2003  for Promethea   67  68  He has received the Eisner Award for Best Writer nine times since 1988  and among his numerous international prizes are the German Max  amp  Moritz Prize for an exceptional oeuvre  2008  and the British National Comics Award for Best Comics Writer Ever  in 2001 and 2002   Hij also won French awards like the Angoul me International Comics Festival Prize for Best Album for Watchmen in 1989 and V for Vendetta in 1990  and the Prix de la critique for From Hell in 2001  the Swedish Urhunden Prize in 1992 for Watchmen and several Spanish Haxtur Awards  in 1988 for Watchmen and 1989 for Swamp Thing No  5  both for Best Writer   Moore was also lauded outside the world of comics  In 1988  Moore and artist Dave Gibbons won a Hugo Award in the category Other Forms for Watchmen  The category was created for that year only  via a rarely used provision that allows the Committee of the Worldcon to create any temporary Additional Category it feels appropriate  no subsequent committee has repeated this category   69  In 1988 he received a World Fantasy Award for Best Novella for A Hypothetical Lizard  which Avatar Press published in 2004 as a comics adaption by Antony Johnston  Moore also won two International Horror Guild Awards in the category Graphic Story Illustrated Narrative  in 1995 with Eddie Campbell for From Hell and in 2003 with Kevin O Neill for The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  70  and in 2000 The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen landed a Bram Stoker Award in the category Best Illustrated Narrative  In 2005  Watchmen was the only comic book to make it onto Time Magazine s  All Time 100 Novels  list  71   edit  Film adaptations Due to the success of his comics  a number of filmmakers have expressed a desire to make film adaptations over the years  However  Moore himself has consistently opposed such ventures  stating that  I wanted to give comics a special place when I was writing things like Watchmen  I wanted to show off just what the possibilities of the comic book medium were  and films are completely different   72  Expressing similar sentiments  he also remarked that  If we only see comics in relation to movies then the best that they will ever be is films that do not move  I found it  in the mid 80s  preferable to concentrate on those things that only comics could achieve  The way in which a tremendous amount of information could be included visually in every panel  the juxtapositions between what a character was saying  and what the image that the reader was looking at would be  So in a sense  most of my work from the 80s onwards was designed to be un filmable   39  The first film to be based upon Moore s work was From Hell in 2001  which was directed by the Hughes Brothers  The film made a number of radical differences from the original comic  altering the main character from an older  conservative detective to a young character played by Johnny Depp  This was followed in 2003 with The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  a film that departed radically from the books  changing the ending from a mob war over the skies of London to the infiltration of a secret base in Tibet  For these two works  Moore was content to allow the filmmakers to do whatever they wished and removed himself from the process entirely   As long as I could distance myself by not seeing them   he said  he could profit from the films while leaving the original comics untouched   assured no one would confuse the two  This was probably na ve on my part   73  His attitude changed after producer Martin Poll and screenwriter Larry Cohen filed a lawsuit against 20th Century Fox  alleging that the film The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen plagiarised an unproduced script they had written entitled Cast of Characters  Although the two scripts bear many similarities  most of them are elements that were added for the film and do not originate in Moore s comics  According to Moore   They seemed to believe that the head of 20th Century Fox called me up and persuaded me to steal this screenplay  turning it into a comic book they could then adapt back into a movie  to camouflage petty larceny   Moore testified in a deposition  a process he found so unpleasant that he surmised he would have been better treated had he  molested and murdered a busload of retarded children after giving them heroin   Fox s settlement of the case insulted Moore  who interpreted it as an admission of guilt  73  In 2005  a film adaptation of Moore s V for Vendetta was released  produced by the Wachowski Brothers and directed by James McTeigue  Producer Joel Silver said at a press conference for the Warner Bros   V for Vendetta that fellow producer Larry Wachowski had talked with Moore  and that   Moore  was very excited about what Larry had to say   74  Moore disputed this  reporting that he told Wachowski  I didn t want anything to do with films    I wasn t interested in Hollywood   and demanded that DC Comics force Warner Bros to issue a public retraction and apology for Silver s  blatant lies   Although Silver called Moore directly to apologise  no public retraction appeared  Moore was quoted as saying that the comic book had been  specifically about things like fascism and anarchy  Those words   fascism  and  anarchy   occur nowhere in the film  It s been turned into a Bush era parable by people too timid to set a political satire in their own country   75  This conflict between Moore and DC Comics was the subject of an article in The New York Times 30  on 12 March 2006  five days before the USA release  In the New York Times article  Silver stated that about 20 years prior to the film s release  he met with Moore and Dave Gibbons when Silver acquired the film rights to V For Vendetta and Watchmen  Silver stated   Alan was odd  but he was enthusiastic and encouraging us to do this  I had foolishly thought that he would continue feeling that way today  not realising that he wouldn t   Moore did not deny this meeting or Silver s characterisation of Moore at that meeting  nor did Moore state that he advised Silver of his change of opinion in those approximately 20 years  The New York Times article also interviewed David Lloyd about Moore s reaction to the film s production  stating   Mr  Lloyd  the illustrator of V for Vendetta  also found it difficult to sympathise with Mr  Moore s protests  When he and Mr  Moore sold their film rights to the comic book  Mr  Lloyd said   We didn t do it innocently  Neither myself nor Alan thought we were signing it over to a board of trustees who would look after it like it was the Dead Sea Scrolls   30  Moore has subsequently stated that he wishes his name to be removed from all comic work that he does not own  including Watchmen and V for Vendetta  much as unhappy film directors often choose to have their names removed and be credited as  Alan Smithee   He also announced that he would not allow his name to be used in any future film adaptations of works he does not own  nor would he accept any money from such adaptations  76  This request was respected by the producers of the subsequent adaptations of his work Constantine  2005   based on a character created by Moore  and Watchmen  2009   and his name was removed from the V for Vendetta credits  77  78   edit  Personal life Since his teenage years Moore has had long hair  and since early adulthood has also worn a beard  He has taken to wearing a number of large rings on his hands  leading him to be described as a  cross between Hagrid and Danny from Withnail And I  who could be easily mistaken for  the village eccentric   57  Born and raised in Northampton  he continues to live in the town  and used its history as a basis for his novel Voice of the Fire  His  unassuming terraced  Northampton home was described by an interviewer in 2001 as  something like an occult bookshop under permanent renovation  with records  videos  magical artefacts and comic book figurines strewn among shelves of mystical tomes and piles of paper  The bathroom  with blue and gold d cor and a generous sunken tub  is palatial  the rest of the house has possibly never seen a vacuum cleaner  This is clearly a man who spends little time on the material plane   57  He likes to live in his hometown  feeling that it affords him a level of obscurity that he enjoys  remarking that  I never signed up to be a celebrity   39  With his first wife Phyllis  whom he married in the early 1970s  he has two daughters  Leah and Amber  The couple also had a mutual lover  Deborah  although the relationship between the three ended in the early 1990s as Phyllis and Deborah left Moore  taking his daughters with them  6  pp158 159  79  On 12 May 2007  he married Melinda Gebbie  with whom he has worked on several comics  most notably Lost Girls  80   edit  Religion and magic In 1993  on his fortieth birthday  Moore openly declared his dedication to being a ceremonial magician  something he saw as  a logical end step to my career as a writer   39  According to a 2001 interview  his inspiration for doing this came when he was writing From Hell in the early 1990s  a book containing much Freemasonic and occult symbolism   One word balloon in From Hell completely hijacked my life  A character says something like   The one place gods inarguably exist is in the human mind   After I wrote that  I realised I d accidentally made a true statement  and now I d have to rearrange my entire life around it  The only thing that seemed to really be appropriate was to become a magician   57  Moore associates magic very much with writing   I believe that magic is art  and that art  whether that be music  writing  sculpture  or any other form  is literally magic  Art is  like magic  the science of manipulating symbols  words or images  to achieve changes in consciousness  Indeed to cast a spell is simply to spell  to manipulate words  to change people s consciousness  and this is why I believe that an artist or writer is the closest thing in the contemporary world to a shaman   39   Monotheism is  to me  a great simplification  I mean the Qabalah has a great multiplicity of gods  but at the very top of the Qabalic Tree of Life  you have this one sphere that is absolute God  the Monad  something which is indivisible  All of the other gods  and indeed everything else in the universe  is a kind of emanation of that God  Now  that s fine  but it s when you suggest that there is only that one God  at this kind of unreachable height above humanity  and there is nothing in between  you re limiting and simplifying the thing  I tend to think of paganism as a kind of alphabet  as a language  it s like all of the gods are letters in that language  They express nuances  shades of meaning or certain subtleties of ideas  whereas monotheism tends to just be one vowel and it s just something like  oooooooo   It s a monkey sound   Alan Moore 39  Connecting his esoteric beliefs with his career in writing  he conceptualised a hypothetical area known as the  Idea Space   describing it as     a space in which mental events can be said to occur  an idea space which is perhaps universal  Our individual consciousnesses have access to this vast universal space  just as we have individual houses  but the street outside the front door belongs to everybody  It s almost as if ideas are pre existing forms within this space  The landmasses that might exist in this mind space would be composed entirely of ideas  of concepts  that instead of continents and islands you might have large belief systems  philosophies  Marxism might be one  Judeo Christian religions might make up another   He subsequently believed that to navigate this space  magical systems like the tarot and the Qabalah would have to be used  39  Taking up the study of the Qabalah and the writings of the notorious early 20th century occultist Aleister Crowley  Moore accepted ideas from Crowley s religion  Thelema  about True Will being connected to the will of the pantheistic universe  39  In some of his earlier magical rituals  he utilised mind altering psychedelic drugs but later gave this up  believing that they were unnecessary  and stated   It s frightening  You call out the names in this strange incomprehensible language  and you re looking into the glass and there appears to be this little man talking to you  It just works   57  Moore took as his primary deity the ancient Roman snake god Glycon  who was the centre of a cult founded by a prophet known as Alexander of Abonoteichus  and according to Alexander s critic Lucian  the god itself was merely a puppet  something Moore accepts  considering him to be a  complete hoax   81  82  but dismisses as irrelevant  According to Pagan Studies scholar Ethan Doyle White   The very fact that Glycon was probably one big hoax was enough to convince Moore to devote himself to the scaly lord  for  as Moore maintains  the imagination is just as real as reality   8   edit  Anarchism Moore politically identifies as an anarchist  22  and outlined his interpretation of anarchist philosophy  and its application to fiction writing in an interview with Margaret Killjoy  collected in the 2009 book  Mythmakers and Lawbreakers  I believe that all other political states are in fact variations or outgrowths of a basic state of anarchy  after all  when you mention the idea of anarchy to most people they will tell you what a bad idea it is because the biggest gang would just take over  Which is pretty much how I see contemporary society  We live in a badly developed anarchist situation in which the biggest gang has taken over and have declared that it is not an anarchist situation   that it is a capitalist or a communist situation  But I tend to think that anarchy is the most natural form of politics for a human being to actually practice  83  In December 2011 Moore responded to Frank Miller s attack on the Occupy movement  calling his more recent work misogynistic  homophobic and misguided  Worldwide  Occupy protesters have adopted the Guy Fawkes mask from V for Vendetta  84  85  The mask has also been adopted by Anonymous  Wikileaks and anti globalization demonstrators  86  Moore described Occupy as  ordinary people reclaiming rights which should always have been theirs  87  and added  I can t think of any reason why as a population we should be expected to stand by and see a gross reduction in the living standards of ourselves and our kids  possibly for generations  when the people who have got us into this have been rewarded for it   they ve certainly not been punished in any way because they re too big to fail  I think that the Occupy movement is  in one sense  the public saying that they should be the ones to decide who s too big to fail  As an anarchist  I believe that power should be given to the people whose lives this is actually affecting  87   edit  On conspiracy theories Doing research into conspiracy theories for his work on Brought to Light  he came to develop his own opinions on the subject of a global conspiracy  stating that  Yes  there is a conspiracy  indeed there are a great number of conspiracies  all tripping each other up  the main thing that I learned about conspiracy theories is that conspiracy theorists actually believe in the conspiracy because that is more comforting  The truth of the world is that it is chaotic  The truth is  that it is not the Jewish banking conspiracy  or the grey aliens  or the twelve foot reptiloids from another dimension that are in control  the truth is far more frightening  no one is in control  the world is rudderless   39   edit  Selected bibliography Main article  Alan Moore bibliography Comics V for Vendetta  1982 1985  Watchmen  1986 1987  A Small Killing  1991  Lost Girls  1991 1992  2006  From Hell
