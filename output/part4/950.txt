Terrorism is the systematic use of terror  especially as a means of coercion  In the international community  however  terrorism has no universally agreed  legally binding  criminal law definition  1  2  Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts which are intended to create fear  terror   are perpetrated for a religious  political or  ideological goal  and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non combatants  civilians   Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war  The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group  The word  terrorism  is politically and emotionally charged  3  and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition  Studies have found over 100 definitions of  terrorism   4  5  The concept of terrorism may itself be controversial as it is often used by state authorities  and individuals with access to state support  to delegitimize political or other opponents  6  and potentially legitimize the state s own use of armed force against opponents  such use of force may itself be described as  terror  by opponents of the state   6  7  Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations for furthering their objectives  It has been practiced by both right wing and left wing political parties  nationalistic groups  religious groups  revolutionaries  and ruling governments  8  An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against noncombatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group  cause  or individual  9  Contents 1 Origin of term 2 Definition 3

the French word terrorisme  10  and originally referred specifically to state terrorism as practiced by the French government during the Reign of terror  The French word terrorisme in turn derives from the Latin verb terre  meaning  I frighten   11  The terror cimbricus was a panic and state of emergency in Rome in response to the approach of warriors of the Cimbri tribe in 105 BC  The Jacobins cited this precedent when imposing a Reign of Terror during the French Revolution  12  13  After the Jacobins lost power  the word  terrorist  became a term of abuse  6  Although  terrorism  originally referred to acts committed by a government  currently it usually refers to the killing of innocent people 14  by a non government group in such a way as to create a media spectacle  15  This meaning can be traced back to Sergey Nechayev  who described himself as a  terrorist   16  Nechayev founded the Russian terrorist group  People s Retribution                      in 1869  In November 2004  a United Nations Secretary General report described terrorism as any act  intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act   17  Definition Main article  Definition of terrorism The definition of terrorism has proved controversial  Various legal systems and government agencies use different definitions of terrorism in their national legislation  Moreover  the international community has been slow to formulate a universally agreed  legally binding definition of this crime  These difficulties arise from the fact that the term  terrorism  is politically and emotionally charged  18  In this regard  Angus Martyn  briefing the Australian Parliament  stated that  The international community has never succeeded in developing an accepted comprehensive definition of terrorism  During the 1970s and 1980s  the United Nations attempts to define the term foundered mainly due to differences of opinion between various members about the use of violence in the context of conflicts over national liberation and self determination   1  These divergences have made it impossible for the United Nations to conclude a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism that incorporates a single  all encompassing  legally binding  criminal law definition terrorism  19  Nonetheless  the international community has adopted a series of sectoral conventions that define and criminalize various types of terrorist activities  Moreover  since 1994  the United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly condemned terrorist acts using the following political description of terrorism   Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public  a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable  whatever the considerations of a political  philosophical  ideological  racial  ethnic  religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them   20  Bruce Hoffman  a well known scholar  has noted that  It is not only individual agencies within the same governmental apparatus that cannot agree on a single definition of terrorism  Experts and other long established scholars in the field are equally incapable of reaching a consensus  In the first edition of his magisterial survey   Political terrorism  A Research Guide   Alex Schmid devoted more than a hundred pages to examining more than a hundred different definition of terrorism in a effort to discover a broadly acceptable  reasonably comprehensive explication of the word  Four years and a second edition later  Schimd was no closer to the goal of his quest  conceding in the first sentence of the revised volume that the  search for an adequate definition is still on  Walter Laqueur despaired of defining terrorism in both editions of his monumental work on the subject  maintaining that it is neither possible to do so nor worthwhile to make the attempt   21  Nonetheless  Hoffman himself believes it is possible to identify some key characteristics of terrorism  He proposes that  The Baghdad bus station was the scene of a triple car bombing in August 2005 that killed 43 people  By distinguishing terrorists from other types of criminals and terrorism from other forms of crime  we come to appreciate that terrorism is   ineluctably political in aims and motives violent   or  equally important  threatens violence designed to have far reaching psychological repercussions beyond the immediate victim or target conducted by an organization with an identifiable chain of command or conspiratorial cell structure  whose members wear no uniform or identifying insignia  and perpetrated by a subnational group or non state entity  22  A definition proposed by Carsten Bockstette at the George C  Marshall Center for European Security Studies  underlines the psychological and tactical aspects of terrorism  Terrorism is defined as political violence in an asymmetrical conflict that is designed to induce terror and psychic fear  sometimes indiscriminate  through the violent victimization and destruction of noncombatant targets  sometimes iconic symbols   Such acts are meant to send a message from an illicit clandestine organization  The purpose of terrorism is to exploit the media in order to achieve maximum attainable publicity as an amplifying force multiplier in order to influence the targeted audience s  in order to reach short  and midterm political goals and or desired long term end states   23  Walter Laqueur  of the Center for Strategic and International Studies  noted that  the only general characteristic of terrorism generally agreed upon is that terrorism involves violence and the threat of violence   citation needed  This criterion alone does not produce  however  a useful definition  since it includes many violent acts not usually considered terrorism  war  riot  organized crime  or even a simple assault  citation needed  Property destruction that does not endanger life is not usually considered a violent crime  according to whom   but some have described property destruction by the Earth Liberation Front 24  and Animal Liberation Front 25  as violence and terrorism  see eco terrorism  Terrorist attacks are usually carried out in such a way as to maximize the severity and length of the psychological impact  26  Each act of terrorism is a  performance  devised to have an impact on many large audiences  Terrorists also attack national symbols  27  to show power and to attempt to shake the foundation of the country or society they are opposed to  This may negatively affect a government  while increasing the prestige of the given terrorist organization and or ideology behind a terrorist act  28  Terrorist acts frequently have a political purpose  29  Terrorism is a political tactic  like letter writing or protesting  which is used by activists when they believe that no other means will effect the kind of change they desire  according to whom   The change is desired so badly that failure to achieve change is seen as a worse outcome than the deaths of civilians  citation needed  This is often where the inter relationship between terrorism and religion occurs  When a political struggle is integrated into the framework of a religious or  cosmic  30  struggle  such as over the control of an ancestral homeland or holy site such as Israel and Jerusalem  failing in the political goal  nationalism  becomes equated with spiritual failure  which  for the highly committed  is worse than their own death or the deaths of innocent civilians  31  Very often  the victims of terrorism are targeted not because they are threats  but because they are specific  symbols  tools  animals or corrupt beings  citation needed  that tie into a specific view of the world that the terrorists possess  Their suffering accomplishes the terrorists  goals of instilling fear  getting their message out to an audience or otherwise satisfying the demands of their often radical religious and political agendas  32  A collection of photographs of those killed during the terrorists attacks on September 11  2001  Some official  governmental definitions of terrorism use the criterion of the illegitimacy or unlawfulness of the act  33  better source needed  to distinguish between actions authorized by a government  and thus  lawful   and those of other actors  including individuals and small groups  Using this criterion  actions that would otherwise qualify as terrorism would not be considered terrorism if they were government sanctioned  citation needed  For example  firebombing a city  which is designed to affect civilian support for a cause  would not be considered terrorism if it were authorized by a government  original research   This criterion is inherently problematic and is not universally accepted  attribution needed  because  it denies the existence of state terrorism  34  the same act may or may not be classed as terrorism depending on whether its sponsorship is traced to a  legitimate  government   legitimacy  and  lawfulness  are subjective  depending on the perspective of one government or another  and it diverges from the historically accepted meaning and origin of the term  10  35  36  37  Among the various definitions there are several that do not recognize the possibility of legitimate use of violence by civilians against an invader in an occupied country  citation needed  Other definitions would label as terrorist groups only the resistance movements that oppose an invader with violent acts that undiscriminately kill or harm civilians and non combatants  thus making a distinction between lawful and unlawful use of violence  citation needed  According to Ali Khan  the distinction lies ultimatedly in a political judgment  38  An associated  and arguably more easily definable  but not equivalent term is violent non state actor  39  The semantic scope of this term includes not only  terrorists   but while excluding some individuals or groups who have previously been described as  terrorists   and also explicitly excludes state terrorism  According to the FBI terrorism is the unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government  the civilian population  or any segment thereof  in furtherance of political or social objectives  citation needed  Pejorative use The terms  terrorism  and  terrorist   someone who engages in terrorism  carry strong negative connotations  40  These terms are often used as political labels  to condemn violence or the threat of violence by certain actors as immoral  indiscriminate  unjustified or to condemn an entire segment of a population  41  Those labeled  terrorists  by their opponents rarely identify themselves as such  and typically use other terms or terms specific to their situation  such as separatist  freedom fighter  liberator  revolutionary  vigilante  militant  paramilitary  guerrilla  rebel  patriot  or any similar meaning word in other languages and cultures  Jihadi  mujaheddin  and fedayeen are similar Arabic words which have entered the English lexicon  It is common for both parties in a conflict to describe each other as terrorists  42  Attack by CIA funded Mujahideen terrorists in Afghanistan in 1985  Ronald Reagan praised Afghan mujahideen as  freedom fighters   On the question of whether particular terrorist acts  such as killing civilians  can be justified as the lesser evil in a particular circumstance  philosophers have expressed different views  while  according to David Rodin  utilitarian philosophers can  in theory  conceive of cases in which the evil of terrorism is outweighed by the good which could not be achieved in a less morally costly way  in practice the  harmful effects of undermining the convention of non combatant immunity is thought to outweigh the goods that may be achieved by particular acts of terrorism   43  Among the non utilitarian philosophers  Michael Walzer argued that terrorism can be morally justified in only one specific case  when  a nation or community faces the extreme threat of complete destruction and the only way it can preserve itself is by intentionally targeting non combatants  then it is morally entitled to do so   43  44  In his book Inside Terrorism Bruce Hoffman offered an explanation of why the term terrorism becomes distorted  On one point  at least  everyone agrees  terrorism is a pejorative term  It is a word with intrinsically negative connotations that is generally applied to one s enemies and opponents  or to those with whom one disagrees and would otherwise prefer to ignore   What is called terrorism   Brian Jenkins has written   thus seems to depend on one s point of view  Use of the term implies a moral judgment  and if one party can successfully attach the label terrorist to its opponent  then it has indirectly persuaded others to adopt its moral viewpoint   Hence the decision to call someone or label some organization terrorist becomes almost unavoidably subjective  depending largely on whether one sympathizes with or opposes the person group cause concerned  If one identifies with the victim of the violence  for example  then the act is terrorism  If  however  one identifies with the perpetrator  the violent act is regarded in a more sympathetic  if not positive  or  at the worst  an ambivalent  light  and it is not terrorism  45  46  47  The pejorative connotations of the word can be summed up in the aphorism   One man s terrorist is another man s freedom fighter   42  This is exemplified when a group using irregular military methods is an ally of a state against a mutual enemy  but later falls out with the state and starts to use those methods against its former ally  During World War II  the Malayan People s Anti Japanese Army was allied with the British  but during the Malayan Emergency  members of its successor  the Malayan Races Liberation Army   were branded  terrorists  by the British  48  49  More recently  Ronald Reagan and others in the American administration frequently called the Afghan Mujahideen  freedom fighters  during their war against the Soviet Union  50  yet twenty years later  when a new generation of Afghan men are fighting against what they perceive to be a regime installed by foreign powers  their attacks are labelled  terrorism  by George W  Bush  51  52  Groups accused of terrorism understandably prefer terms reflecting legitimate military or ideological action  53  54  55  Leading terrorism researcher Professor Martin Rudner  director of the Canadian Centre of Intelligence and Security Studies at Ottawa s Carleton University  defines  terrorist acts  as attacks against civilians for political or other ideological goals  and said  There is the famous statement   One man s terrorist is another man s freedom fighter   But that is grossly misleading  It assesses the validity of the cause when terrorism is an act  One can have a perfectly beautiful cause and yet if one commits terrorist acts  it is terrorism regardless  56  Some groups  when involved in a  liberation  struggle  have been called  terrorists  by the Western governments or media  Later  these same persons  as leaders of the liberated nations  are called  statesmen  by similar organizations  Two examples of this phenomenon are the Nobel Peace Prize laureates Menachem Begin and Nelson Mandela  57  58  59  60  61  62 WikiLeaks whistleblower Julian Assange has been called a  terrorist  by Sarah Palin and Joe Biden  63  64  Sometimes states which are close allies  for reasons of history  culture and politics  can disagree over whether or not members of a certain organization are terrorists  For instance  for many years  some branches of the United States government refused to label members of the Irish Republican Army  IRA  as terrorists while the IRA was using methods against one of the United States  closest allies  the United Kingdom  which the UK branded as terrorism  This was highlighted by the Quinn v  Robinson case  65  66  For these and other reasons  media outlets wishing to preserve a reputation for impartiality try to be careful in their use of the term  67  68  Types of terrorism A view of damages to the U S  Embassy in Beirut caused by a terrorist bomb attack  April 1983 Sbarro pizza restaurant bombing in Jerusalem  in which 15 Israeli civilians were killed and 130 wounded by a Hamas suicide bomber  In early 1975  the Law Enforcement Assistant Administration in the United States formed the National Advisory Committee on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals  One of the five volumes that the committee wrote was entitled Disorders and Terrorism  produced by the Task Force on Disorders and Terrorism under the direction of H H A  Cooper  Director of the Task Force staff  69  The Task Force classified terrorism into six categories  Civil disorder   A form of collective violence interfering with the peace  security  and normal functioning of the community  Political terrorism   Violent criminal behaviour designed primarily to generate fear in the community  or substantial segment of it  for political purposes  Non Political terrorism   Terrorism that is not aimed at political purposes but which exhibits  conscious design to create and maintain a high degree of fear for coercive purposes  but the end is individual or collective gain rather than the achievement of a political objective   Quasi terrorism   The activities incidental to the commission of crimes of violence that are similar in form and method to genuine terrorism but which nevertheless lack its essential ingredient  It is not the main purpose of the quasi terrorists to induce terror in the immediate victim as in the case of genuine terrorism  but the quasi terrorist uses the modalities and techniques of the genuine terrorist and produces similar consequences and reaction  70  For example  the fleeing felon who takes hostages is a quasi terrorist  whose methods are similar to those of the genuine terrorist but whose purposes are quite different  Limited political terrorism   Genuine political terrorism is characterized by a revolutionary approach  limited political terrorism refers to  acts of terrorism which are committed for ideological or political motives but which are not part of a concerted campaign to capture control of the state  Official or state terrorism   referring to nations whose rule is based upon fear and oppression that reach similar to terrorism or such proportions   It may also be referred to as Structural Terrorism defined broadly as terrorist acts carried out by governments in pursuit of political objectives  often as part of their foreign policy  Number of failed  foiled or successful terrorist attacks by year and type within the European Union  Source  Europol  71  72  73  Only 1 person died in terrorist attacks from a separatist groups in 2010  71  Several sources 74  75  76  have further defined the typology of terrorism  Political terrorism Sub state terrorism Social revolutionary terrorism Nationalist separatist terrorism Religious extremist terrorism Religious fundamentalist Terrorism New religions terrorism Right wing terrorism Left wing terrorism Single issue terrorism State sponsored terrorism Regime or state terrorism Criminal terrorism Pathological terrorism Motivation of terrorists Attacks on  collaborators  are used to intimidate people from cooperating with the state in order to undermine state control  This strategy was used in the USA in its War of Independence and in Ireland  in Kenya  in Algeria and in Cyprus in their independence struggles  Attacks on high profile symbolic targets are used to incite counter terrorism by the state to polarise the population  This strategy is used by Al Qaeda in its attacks on the USA in September 2001  These attacks are also used to draw international attention to struggles which are otherwise unreported such as the Palestininian airplane hijackings in 1970 and the South Moluccan hostage crises in the Netherlands in 1975  Abrahm suggests that terrorist organizations do not select terrorism for its political effectiveness  77  Individual terrorists tend to be motivated more by a desire for social solidarity with other members of their organization than by political platforms or strategic objectives  which are often murky and undefined  77  Democracy and domestic terrorism Demonstration in Madrid against ETA  January 2000  Roughly a million people met there  The relationship between domestic terrorism and democracy is very complex  Terrorism is most common in nations with intermediate political freedom  and is least common in the most democratic nations  78  79  80  81  However  one study suggests that suicide terrorism may be an exception to this general rule  Evidence regarding this particular method of terrorism reveals that every modern suicide campaign has targeted a democracy a state with a considerable degree of political freedom  82  The study suggests that concessions awarded to terrorists during the 1980s and 1990s for suicide attacks increased their frequency  83  Some examples of  terrorism  in non democracies include ETA in Spain under Francisco Franco  although the group s terrorist activities increased sharply after Franco s death   84  the Shining Path in Peru under Alberto Fujimori  85  the Kurdistan Workers Party when Turkey was ruled by military leaders and the ANC in South Africa  86  Democracies  such as the United Kingdom  United States  Israel  Indonesia  India  Spain and the Philippines  have also experienced domestic terrorism  While a democratic nation espousing civil liberties may claim a sense of higher moral ground than other regimes  an act of terrorism within such a state may cause a dilemma  whether to maintain its civil liberties and thus risk being perceived as ineffective in dealing with the problem  or alternatively to restrict its civil liberties and thus risk delegitimizing its claim of supporting civil liberties  87  For this reason  homegrown terrorism has started to be seen as a greater threat  as stated by former CIA Director Michael Hayden  88  This dilemma  some social theorists would conclude  may very well play into the initial plans of the acting terrorist s   namely  to delegitimize the state  89  Religious terrorism Main article  Religious terrorism Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing  Some 35 000 Pakistanis have died from terrorist attacks in recent years  90  Religious terrorism is terrorism performed by groups or individuals  the motivation of which is typically rooted in faith based tenets  Terrorist acts throughout the centuries have been performed on religious grounds with the hope to either spread or enforce a system of belief  viewpoint or opinion  91  Religious terrorism does not in itself necessarily define a specific religious standpoint or view  but instead usually defines an individual or a group view or interpretation of that belief system s teachings  Perpetrators The perpetrators of acts of terrorism can be individuals  groups  or states  According to some definitions  clandestine or semi clandestine state actors may also carry out terrorist acts outside the framework of a state of war  However  the most common image of terrorism is that it is carried out by small and secretive cells  highly motivated to serve a particular cause and many of the most deadly operations in recent times  such as the September 11 attacks  the London underground bombing  and the 2002 Bali bombing were planned and carried out by a close clique  composed of close friends  family members and other strong social networks  These groups benefited from the free flow of information and efficient telecommunications to succeed where others had failed  92  Over the years  many people have attempted to come up with a terrorist profile to attempt to explain these individuals  actions through their psychology and social circumstances  Others  like Roderick Hindery  have sought to discern profiles in the propaganda tactics used by terrorists  Some security organizations designate these groups as violent non state actors  93  A 2007 study by economist Alan B  Krueger found that terrorists were less likely to come from an impoverished background  28  vs  33   and more likely to have at least a high school education  47  vs  38    Another analysis found only 16  of terrorists came from impoverished families  vs  30  of male Palestinians  and over 60  had gone beyond high school  vs  15  of the populace  94  To avoid detection  a terrorist will look  dress  and behave normally until executing the assigned mission  Some claim that attempts to profile terrorists based on personality  physical  or sociological traits are not useful  95  The physical and behavioral description of the terrorist could describe almost any normal person  96  However  the majority of terrorist attacks are carried out by military age men  aged 16 40  96  Terrorist groups There is speculation that anthrax mailed inside letters to U S  politicians was the work of a lone wolf terrorist  Main articles  List of designated terrorist organizations and Lone wolf  terrorism  State sponsors Main article  State sponsored terrorism A state can sponsor terrorism by funding or harboring a terrorist organization  Opinions as to which acts of violence by states consist of state sponsored terrorism vary widely  When states provide funding for groups considered by some to be terrorist  they rarely acknowledge them as such  State terrorism Main article  State terrorism Civilization is based on a clearly defined and widely accepted yet often unarticulated hierarchy  Violence done by those higher on the hierarchy to those lower is nearly always invisible  that is  unnoticed  When it is noticed  it is fully rationalized  Violence done by those lower on the hierarchy to those higher is unthinkable  and when it does occur is regarded with shock  horror  and the fetishization of the victims   Derrick Jensen 97  This terrified baby was almost the only human being left alive in Shanghai s South Station after brutal Japanese bombing  August 28  1937 As with  terrorism  the concept of  state terrorism  is controversial  98  The Chairman of the United Nations Counter Terrorism Committee has stated that the Committee was conscious of 12 international Conventions on the subject  and none of them referred to State terrorism  which was not an international legal concept  If States abused their power  they should be judged against international conventions dealing with war crimes  international human rights and international humanitarian law  99  Former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan has said that it is  time to set aside debates on so called  state terrorism   The use of force by states is already thoroughly regulated under international law  100  However  he also made clear that   regardless of the differences between governments on the question of definition of terrorism  what is clear and what we can all agree on is any deliberate attack on innocent civilians  regardless of one s cause  is unacceptable and fits into the definition of terrorism   101  State terrorism has been used to refer to terrorist acts by governmental agents or forces  This involves the use of state resources employed by a state s foreign policies  such as using its military to directly perform acts of terrorism  Professor of Political Science Michael Stohl cites the examples that include Germany s bombing of London and the U S  atomic destruction of Hiroshima during World War II  He argues that  the use of terror tactics is common in international relations and the state has been and remains a more likely employer of terrorism within the international system than insurgents   They also cite the First strike option as an example of the  terror of coercive diplomacy  as a form of this  which holds the world hostage with the implied threat of using nuclear weapons in  crisis management   They argue that the institutionalized form of terrorism has occurred as a result of changes that took place following World War II  In this analysis  state terrorism exhibited as a form of foreign policy was shaped by the presence and use of weapons of mass destruction  and that the legitimizing of such violent behavior led to an increasingly accepted form of this state behavior  102  103  103  Some theorists suggest genocide is a type of terrorism as committed by Adolf Hitler  citation needed  State terrorism has also been used to describe peacetime actions by governmental agents such as the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103  104 Charles Stewart Parnell described William Ewart Gladstone s Irish Coercion Act as terrorism in his  no Rent manifesto  in 1881  during the Irish Land War  105  The concept is also used to describe political repressions by governments against their own civilian population with the purpose to incite fear  For example  taking and executing civilian hostages or extrajudicial elimination campaigns are commonly considered  terror  or terrorism  for example during the Red Terror or Great Terror  106  Such actions are often also described as democide or genocide which has been argued to be equivalent to state terrorism  107  Empirical studies on this have found that democracies have little democide  108  109  Funding Main article  Terrorist financing State sponsors have constituted a major form of funding  for example  Palestine Liberation Organization  Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and some other terrorist groups were funded by the Soviet Union  110  111  The Stern Gang received funding from Italian Fascist officers in Beirut to undermine the British Mandate for Palestine  112   Revolutionary tax  is another major form of funding  and essentially a euphemism for  protection money   110  Revolutionary taxes are typically extorted from businesses  and they also  play a secondary role as one other means of intimidating the target population   110  Other major sources of funding include kidnapping for ransoms  smuggling  fraud and robbery  110  The Financial Action Task Force is an inter governmental body whose mandate  since October 2001  has included combatting terrorist financing  113  Tactics Main article  Tactics of terrorism The Wall Street bombing at noon on September 16  1920 killed thirty eight people and injured several hundred  The perpetrators were never caught  Terrorism is a form of asymmetric warfare  and is more common when direct conventional warfare will not be effective because forces vary greatly in power  114  The context in which terrorist tactics are used is often a large scale  unresolved political conflict  The type of conflict varies widely  historical examples include  Secession of a territory to form a new sovereign state or become part of a different state Dominance of territory or resources by various ethnic groups Imposition of a particular form of government Economic deprivation of a population Opposition to a domestic government or occupying army Religious fanaticism Terrorist attacks are often targeted to maximize fear and publicity  usually using explosives or poison  115  There is concern about terrorist attacks employing weapons of mass destruction  Terrorist organizations usually methodically plan attacks in advance  and may train participants  plant undercover agents  and raise money from supporters or through organized crime  Communications occur through modern telecommunications  or through old fashioned methods such as couriers  Responses X ray backscatter technology  AIT  machine used by the TSA to screen passengers  According to the TSA  this is what the remote TSA agent would see on their screen  Responses to terrorism are broad in scope  They can include re alignments of the political spectrum and reassessments of fundamental values  Specific types of responses include  Targeted laws  criminal procedures  deportations  and enhanced police powers Target hardening  such as locking doors or adding traffic barriers Preemptive or reactive military action Increased intelligence and surveillance activities Preemptive humanitarian activities More permissive interrogation and detention policies The term counter terrorism has a narrower connotation  implying that it is directed at terrorist actors  According to a report by Dana Priest and William M  Arkin in the Washington Post   Some 1 271 government organizations and 1 931 private companies work on programs related to counterterrorism  homeland security and intelligence in about 10 000 locations across the United States   116  Mass media Media exposure may be a primary goal of those carrying out terrorism  to expose issues that would otherwise be ignored by the media  Some consider this to be manipulation and exploitation of the media  117  The internet has created a new channel for groups to spread their messages  This has created a cycle of measures and counter measures by groups in support of and in opposition to terrorist movements  The United Nations has created its own online counter terrorism resource  118  The mass media will  on occasion  censor organizations involved in terrorism  through self restraint or regulation  to discourage further terrorism  However  this may encourage organizations to perform more extreme acts of terrorism to be shown in the mass media  Conversely James F  Pastor explains the significant relationship between terrorism and the media  and the underlying benefit each receives from the other  119  There is always a point at which the terrorist ceases to manipulate the media gestalt  A point at which the violence may well escalate  but beyond which the terrorist has become symptomatic of the media gestalt itself  Terrorism as we ordinarily understand it is innately media related  History Main article  History of terrorism Number of terrorist incidents 2009  January June  The history of terrorism goes back to Sicarii Zealots   Jewish extremist group active in Iudaea Province at the beginning of the 1st century AD  After Zealotry rebellion in the 1st century AD  when some prominent collaborators with Roman rule were killed  120  121  according to contemporary historian Josephus  in 6 AD Judas of Galilee formed a small and more extreme offshoot of the Zealots  the Sicarii  122  Their terror also was directed against Jewish  collaborators   including temple priests  Sadducees  Herodians  and other wealthy elites  123  The term  terrorism  itself was originally used to describe the actions of the Jacobin Club during the  Reign of Terror  in the French Revolution   Terror is nothing other than justice  prompt  severe  inflexible   said Jacobin leader Maximilien Robespierre  In 1795  Edmund Burke denounced the Jacobins for letting  thousands of those hell hounds called Terrorists   loose on
