Registration Acts the Mutant Registration Act  MRA  and Superhuman Registration Act  SRA or sometimes SHRA   are fictional legislative bills that have been plot points used in various comic books published by Marvel Comics which  when passed into law  enforce the mandatory registration of superpowered individuals with the government  The first mention of the broad concept was in Uncanny X Men  141  January 1981   The term  Registration Act  was first used in Uncanny X Men  181  May 1984   As their names suggest  the Mutant Registration Act and the Superhuman Registration Act deal with the registration of mutants and of superhumans respectively  Numerous versions of each bill have been proposed at different times and in different jurisdictions in the Marvel Universe  A newly passed into law Superhuman Registration Act is a major plot point in Marvel s 2006 crossover limited series Civil War  The concept has been most extensively explored in comic books  though a version of them has featured in both the original X Men animated series and the X Men films  The issue that the government might seek to regulate the activities of super heroes has also been explored in other comics  such as those featuring the Justice Society of America  in Watchmen  in Astro City and in Powers  as well as in films such as The Return Of Captain Invincible  1983  and The Incredibles  2004  and in the role playing games Brave New World  1999   and Dawn of Legends for Savage Worlds  Contents 1 The Registration Acts as a concept 1 1 Publication history 1 2 Issues  allegories and metaphors 1 3

Publication history The idea that super powered individuals might need to be  registered  by the government was first raised in specific relation to mutants  In Uncanny X Men  141   written by Chris Claremont and John Byrne  the concept is briefly suggested  In that issue the term  Registration Act  is not used  but one character  Moira MacTaggert  brings up the notion of  registration   In reference to a politician whom she suspects of anti mutant bigotry she says   Registration today  gas chambers tomorrow   The same issue features mention of the  Mutant Control Act   however it is left unclear exactly what that legislation involves and whether some form of registration is a part of it  However  in New Mutants  1  it was implied that involved the operation of concentration camps  The term  Mutant Registration Act  was first fully used in Uncanny X Men  181  by writer Chris Claremont  As the MRA  as it became known  was passed into law in the Marvel Universe it became widely used as a subplot  plot device or background element across Marvel s entire line of titles  especially those featuring mutants  such as Uncanny X Men  X Factor and New Mutants  during the late 1980s  In the early 1990s Chris Claremont left the X titles and the topic of the MRA began to appear much more rarely in stories  It was still occasionally mentioned  though usually in the past tense  suggesting that it was repealed at some point  though this was never clearly shown  or that it simply ceased to be actively enforced  However  in an interview regarding the Civil War  X Men limited series its writer David Hine suggested that it is still law in the Marvel Universe  stating that in the series the idea of bringing  the Mutant Registration Act in line with the SRA  will be discussed  1  The idea of an equivalent piece of legislation for non mutant super powered individuals a Superhuman Registration Act was first raised in comics that were published during the  Acts of Vengeance  crossover in 1989 1990  The issue was most fully explored in Fantastic Four  335 336 by writer Walter Simonson  In the course of the story  the issue was apparently resolved with the proposed Act being shelved  The concept was then revived in 1993 in Alpha Flight  vol  1   120  May  1993  by writer Simon Furman  In that issue a  Superpowers Registration Act  becomes law in Canada and went on to be a major plot point in the remainder of the series  However later Alpha Flight series did not make use of the concept  In 2006 the concept was again revived by writer Mark Millar as the main plot point in Marvel s 2006 Civil War crossover  In preparation for that storyline a new version of the Superhuman Registration Act has been widely mentioned across various Marvel titles  with the issue being most widely discussed and explored in The Amazing Spider Man  529   531  April   June  2006  by writer J  Michael Straczynski   edit  Issues  allegories and metaphors The issue has generally been portrayed in broad terms as being a debate between the rights of the individual  to freedom of action and expression etc   on one side versus the rights of society at large  to safety from danger or harm  on the other  Does the superpowered individual  mutant or otherwise  have an absolute right to their abilities or does society have a right to constrain or at least monitor them and their expression of those abilities  Debate on the topic of the registration of super heroes or mutants as presented in Marvel Comics has generally tended to be slanted in favor of the anti registration argument  due to the fact that the protagonists of the comics are the powered individuals the people whose freedoms might be compromised by any such law  As such the issue has most often been explored in a civil rights context  with the various Acts portrayed as persecutory measures seeking to legislate against a minority group whose minority status is basically innate an obvious parallel with the struggle of many minority groups against prejudice  This was especially the case in the X Men stories of Chris Claremont  in which the  Act  pertains to mutants  the MRA   The plight of mutants has traditionally been used as an allegory for the struggles of real world minorities such as African Americans and in Claremont s  and other contemporary comic writers in the 1980s  stories the passing of the Mutant Registration Act is generally treated as a negative development  a harbinger of a more repressive climate for mutants  foreshadowing the possible post apocalyptian future first shown in the  Days of Future Past  storyline  When the topic of the original Superhuman Registration Act is debated in Fantastic Four  335 336 the issue is explored in a national security context  with the utility of such a law being challenged  In the comics the Fantastic Four argue that super heroes are already a hugely benevolent force for society and such an act would be unnecessary and possibly counter productive  When the issue of an SRA was raised again in Amazing Spider Man  529   531 the prospect of a new SRA is explored once more from a security perspective  with reference being made to the fact that individual super powered individuals often wield abilities which have massively destructive potential for use  making some mechanism to regulate their activities necessary  As such comparisons and allusions are made to real world issues such as gun control and arms control  The writer of Civil War  Mark Millar  has stated that that storyline will explore the  civil rights  implications of the SHR as previous stories have done  but will also explore the other side of the argument in more depth  in particular how Marvel super heroes are  absent an SRA  illegal vigilantes  lacking proper legal authority or oversight  2   edit  Terms of the registration acts The terms of the various registration acts  previous to the 2006 Superhuman Registration Act  have been vaguely and inconsistently portrayed in the comic books  One aspect of the Acts which has been consistently depicted is their requirement that super powered individuals surrender their real names to the authorities  For many characters  this would entail the loss of their secret identity ies   However  it has been unclear in depictions of the acts  previous to the 2006 SRA  exactly what  outside of the loss of anonymity   registration  entails whether it is enacted to enable the government to monitor all powered individuals or whether it is drafted to facilitate the government s licensing and or employment of individuals who are actively using their powers  It has also been unclear whether the terms of the acts compel all individuals with mutant or superhuman abilities to register with the government or whether only those individuals who wish to use those abilities actively need register  Further unclear is whether registration means that powered individuals are required to simply report their details to the government or whether registration entails an approval process where the powered individual must fulfill some requirements or meet some criteria before they are allowed to fully use their abilities  The provisions of the 2006 version of the Superhuman Registration Act have been more specifically outlined  In a June 2006 interview 3 Civil War editor Tom Brevoort confirmed that registrants to the act have to reveal their identities to the government  but not the public  and they have to undergo some basic testing and or training and satisfy certain  as yet unspecified  standards before they gain legal authorization to continue to use their abilities to fight crime  Government employment is not mandatory  though it is available to those who wish to take it  This has not remained consistent  though  and characters have made reference to all superpowered individuals being forced to register and enlist in S H I E L D  It was revealed in Amazing Spider Man  535 that unregistered individuals are sent to a prison in the otherdimensional Negative Zone indefinitely until they agree to register  Iron Man claims that as this is off United States soil  they have almost no civil rights unless the United States Supreme Court explicitly rules otherwise and he knows they won t  This leads Spider Man to re evaluate his support of the act  After the major conflict of Civil War ends  all the superhero inmates are transferred to real prisons in the state while the facility is transformed into a Maximum Security Prison for high threat level villains such as the Taskmaster and Lady Deathstrike   edit  Fictional history of the Registration Acts  edit  Mutant Control Act The first direct mention of a piece of legislation specifically aimed at super humans in the Marvel Universe comes in Uncanny X Men  141  January 1981  in which the  Mutant Control Act   a law from the future  is mentioned  In the course of the story  the first part of the two part  Days of Future Past  storyline  Kate Pryde travels back in time from a dystopian future to the present and possesses the body of her younger self  X Men member Kitty Pryde  On revealing herself to Kitty s team mates she recounts to them the series of events which led to her dark future  in the hopes that the X Men might be able to prevent those events from coming to pass  One of those pivotal events was the passing of a  Mutant Control Act  by the government of the United States  When the Supreme Court found the law unconstitutional the government responded by reactivating their robot Sentinel program so that they might police the mutant race  The Sentinels interpreted their mandate in such a way that they decided to forcibly take over the government of the country and instituted a harsh regime where mutants were severely persecuted  The reference to the Mutant Control Act is brief  and it is unclear exactly what its provisions would entail  though it would appear that registration forms at least one part of it  In the course of the story the X Men are successful in preventing one of the pivotal events which Pryde had described to them  the assassination of Senator Robert Kelly  from occurring  though the story s end is intentionally ambiguous as to whether Pryde s dystopian future was fully avoided  Although no Mutant Control Act has been introduced in the comics  the Mutant Registration Act may be its equivalent and the events of  Days of Future Past  continue to be alluded to in X Men comics as a possible future   edit  1982 British Super Hero Legislation During the events of the Jaspers  Warp story arc  an insane reality warper  Jim Jaspers  became the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and turned the UK into a fascist state  4  As PM  he enforced  Super Hero Legislation   using armored agents of S T R I K E   the UK division of S H I E L D   to hunt down and detain superhumans within the UK  However  the legislation is abandoned after Captain Britain defeated Jaspers   edit  Mutant Registration Act Registration as a concept is first mentioned in Uncanny X Men  141 where Moira MacTaggert suggests that Robert Kelly has decided the registration of mutants by the government is a necessity  Her suggestion eventually turns out to be accurate  and in the Uncanny X Men  181  May 1984  the first mention of a Mutant Registration Act is made when Kelly is seen discussing his introduction of the bill with a senatorial colleague  By  183  July 1984  the Act is mentioned as passed legislation  and in  188 Nightcrawler remarks that it appears to have become accepted as law  suggesting that  unlike the Mutant Control Act in the  Days of Future Past  timeline  it would not be struck down by the Supreme Court  The passage of the MRA did not have an immediate impact on the plots of any Marvel series  but the legislation continued to be referenced intermittedly in various titles  In at least one instance   X Factor  1  February 1986  the Act is referred to as a  possible new law   an apparent contradiction with its previous depiction as passed legislation  In that story the prospect of the MRA is one of things which motivates Jean Grey and Cyclops to form X Factor  The legislation becomes a plot point later when government agent Val Cooper and the mutant terrorist Mystique form Freedom Force  a government sanctioned superhero team  mostly comprising former members of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants  in Uncanny X Men  199  November 1985   Freedom Force went on to make many appearances where they sought to enforce the MRA by arresting unregistered mutants such as members of the X Men  e g  Uncanny X Men  206  June 1986   X Factor  e g  X Factor  30  July 1988  and the New Mutants  e g  New Mutants  86  February 1990   They also appeared enforcing the MRA in non X Men related titles such as Daredevil  269  August 1989   Captain America  who at this point is John Walker  the character who would later be known as U S  Agent  and Battlestar   two other officially sanctioned super heroes   also briefly enforce the Act by capturing the unregistered mutant Meteorite for the government in Captain America  vol  2   343  July 1988   During this period of active enforcement of the MRA  the only mutants who are shown publicly protesting the Act were those who were not aligned with the X Men or its affiliated teams  For example  in X Factor  33 the Alliance of Evil demonstrates against the MRA in Manhattan and after fighting X Factor are arrested by Freedom Force and in Captain America  368  March 1990  a mutant group called the Resistants are shown protesting the Act in Washington D C   Indeed far from publicly agitating against the act  one X team  X Factor  in its original form  actually pretend in public to be supporters of the MRA who are actively enforcing it  though in actuality they act to subvert it  With Freedom Force  the characters most involved in the enforcement of the Act  no longer existing  they disband following a disastrous mission in Iraq in X Factor Annual  6  1991  and Chris Claremont  the writer who developed the MRA as a sub plot  no longer writing X Men stories after 1992  the Mutant Registration Act stopped appearing prominently in Marvel Universe stories   edit  Proposition X In an attempt to further subjugate the remaining mutant population Simon Trask leads the Humanity Now  coalition in support of federal legislation called Proposition X  Proposition X if passed would have force mandatory chemical birth control on all mutants  While marching to San Francisco s city hall in support of Proposition X Simon Trask and his followers met opposition by Hank McCoy  young mutants and mutant right activist  Hank McCoy s peaceful resistance against Proposition X eventually led to a fight between the opposing sides  In response Norman Osborn will declare martial law in San Francisco which cause the riot that will plague the city the next few nights  These events will lead to Cyclops creating a new mutant sanctuary called Utopia  where mutants can be free from bigoted legislation   edit  1990 Super human Registration Act A variation on the concept of the Mutant Registration Act the Superhuman Registration Act concept is originally proposed in comic books published circa the  Acts of Vengeance  storyline  such as Punisher  vol  2   29 and Avengers  vol  1   313  both January 1990   During that period  in Fantastic Four  335 and 336  December 1989  January 1990  the Fantastic Four go to Congress where a committee is investigating whether an SRA  similar in its provisions to the already in effect Mutant Registration Act  is required for Superheroes  the MRA only covers individuals who have their powers inherently at birth  not those who acquire their abilities artificially in later life   In his testimony and in evidence he presents to Congress  Reed Richards argues that a Super human registration Act is unnecessary as Super humans have been largely effective and trustworthy in their actions and government regulation would only stifle their ability to protect the world  He argues that those individuals who were likely to act irresponsibly with their powers are also likely to be supervillains and thus would not be candidates for registration anyway  As the topic is debated  he and his teammates are continually attacked by random supervillains whom they easily subdue  though it is unclear if this helps or hinders his arguments  In his final point concerning the lack of any workable definition of superhuman Richards demonstrates a device that scans a human for physical and mental capabilities and compares those to the national average  marking  significant outliers  as  superhuman   The device identifies several regular humans  including some committee members  as  superhuman  according to those criteria  The proposed legislation is abandoned and registration of superhumans in the United States is not recommended by the committee   edit  1993 Canadian Super powers Registration Act A similarly titled  Super powers Registration Act  is passed by the Canadian government in Alpha Flight  120  May 1993   Introduced by a minister of the Canadian government named Robert Hagon  the Super powers Registration Act is part of a complex plot engineered by the Master  who is using the alias  Joshua Lord   The terms of the act entail the government employment of all super powered individuals  including mutants  who are then enlisted in one of the government Department H  Flight  programs such as  Alpha Flight  and  Gamma Flight   Although the Act was shown to be controversial and the first series ended with the disbandment of the Canadian government s superteams  the various  Flights   in Alpha Flight  vol  1   130  March 1994   the Canadian SRA is never explicitly repealed or overturned within the comics  Later Alpha Flight series did not acknowledge the law  As of 2006  rumors began to circulate  encouraged by some Marvel creators such as Mark Millar  that a new Alpha Flight series of some form is in the planning stages  5  The rumors suggest that the premise of this series would involve American superheroes fleeing the United States to Canada to escape a newly enacted U S  Superhuman Registration Act  This suggests that registration is no longer mandatory in the Marvel Universe version of Canada  In July 2006 Civil War editor Tom Brevoort concurred with this sentiment saying  we ve seen no evidence of it in ten plus years of Canadian appearances  So if such legislation did exist  it was evidently repealed at some point   6  Other sources  however  such as Michael Avon Oeming s post Civil War title Omega Flight  contradict this statement  which several character mentioning having a Registration Act for years  without the negative effects of the American Superhuman Registration act  7   edit  2006 Superhuman Registration Act Ms  Marvel s SHR card  See also  Civil War  comics  Interest in the concept of the act was revived in various Marvel comic books in 2006  In Amazing Spider Man  529 531  April June 2006   following the events of  Decimation  and the sudden dramatic fall in the Mutant population  the U S  government again considers a Superhuman Registration Act and Spider Man and Iron Man travel to Washington D C  to discuss the issue  In those issues Iron Man is shown to be initially opposed to the idea  while Spider Man is unsure of his opinion  In The New Avengers Special  the Illuminati  May 2006   Iron Man attempts to persuade his Illuminati colleagues to support the SRA  in order to diffuse it  Iron Man predicts that some superhuman or group of superhumans will eventually make a mistake that will cost hundreds of lives  he specifically mentions the Young Avengers and the Runaways as candidates for causing such a catastrophe   After such an event  he went on to predict  the government would inevitably rush to make an example of someone  or everyone  in the superhuman community by passing legislation that would be even more restrictive or persecutory towards them than the proposed SRA  By supporting the Act before it is passed  he suggests  he and his fellow Illuminati might be able to help avert such possible future tragedies and also  by becoming a part of the process  help moderate the legislation so that it would have the minimum possible negative effect on the superhuman community  However  most of the Illuminati members  except for Reed Richards  who ironically had spoken against the similar proposition made 16 years before  see above   flatly reject Stark s proposal  leading to the disbandment of the group  In the same issue the first part of Iron Man s prediction are shown to be accurate when a conflict between the New Warriors and a group of supervillains ends with a massive explosion which kills hundreds of people  including children attending a nearby school  As depicted in the Civil War crossover and series  the public outcry that follows this event leads the government  with the support of Iron Man and fellow Illuminati member Reed Richards  to quickly enact the Superhuman Registration Act  SHRA   6 U S C  S  558  which required those with naturally occurring superhuman abilities  super abilities acquired through science or magic  including extraterrestrials and gods   and even non super powered humans using exotic technology  such as Iron Man  to register as  living weapons of mass destruction   Enactment of the law on the federal level led to various revisions to state criminal codes  such as Chapter 40  Article 120  Section 120 of the New York Penal Code and Section 245 d  of the California Penal Code  in order to allow state and federal coordination in enforcing the law  8  This leads to a major schism and conflict among the superheroes  with the anti SHRA side  regarding the Act as a violation of civil liberties  led by Captain America and the pro SHRA side  seeing the Act as a natural evolution of the superhuman s role in the modern world to regain public trust  led by Iron Man  Eventually  Iron Man s side wins the conflict and the  Fifty State Initiative  is established  Other countries followed America s lead and introduced their own Superhuman Registration laws  Following the Skrull invasion and the subsequent fall from grace of Iron Man  Norman Osborn seizes control of the Initiative and SHIELD  but is prevented from getting his hand on the register  and thus the identities of most of the superhuman community  by Tony Stark when he infects the US government database with a computer virus  technically qualifying Iron Man as a terrorist   There is only one copy of the SHRA database  in Stark s brain  where he deleted it  piece by piece  before Osborn could get his hands on it  ironically destroying the very information that was the focus of  Civil War  in the first place  At the conclusion of  Siege   Steve Rogers is named the new head of security of the United States and as a condition of joining  he convinces the President to dissolve the Act  allowing heroes to return to their daily businesses  9   edit  MI 13 Registration Act First raised in  1 and further detailed in  5 of Captain Britain and MI 13  2008   the British version of registration was started during the Skrull invasion  all superheroes in the UK were drafted with immediate effect into the intelligence agency MI 13  After the invasion  the terms were stated that MI 13 would monitor and support superheroes and call on them for reasons of national defence  but would allow them semi autonomy so they would not feel morally compromised  10   edit  Alternate universe Registration Acts See also  Civil War  comics  Other versions  edit  Ultimate Universe Although no Registration Act exists in the Ultimate Marvel Universe  there are several laws in place that prohibit superhuman activity  Genetic modification of a human being is illegal  and the Superhuman Test Ban Treaty makes it illegal for nations to employ superhumans  This makes the Test Ban Treaty the polar opposite of the SHRA  in Ultimate Six  1  it was stated that the law on deliberately created superhumans is still unclear  allowing Nick Fury to hold supervillains indefinitely without any trial and in hidden locations   5 showed that the President of the United States was unaware of this    edit  Exiles  12 In Exiles  12 a parallel world is shown  similar to the  Days of Future Past  timeline  in which the passing of a Mutant Registration Act led to the Sentinels taking over the world and herding mutants  superhumans and eventually even humans into concentration camps  The  Age of Apocalypse  version of Sabretooth  who at that point was a member of the Exiles  stays on this planet in order to raise the infant David Richards  the son of the Rachel Summers and Franklin Richards of that reality    edit  Marvel Knights  2099 In an alternate world  Earth 2992  shown in the Marvel Knights  2099 series of one shots published in November 2004  a Mutant Registration Act is in effect which mandates that mutants undergo a process which robs them of their abilities  The Marvel Knights  Mutant 2099 one shot explained that after the passage of this act the Avengers  X Men and Fantastic Four opposed the government s enforcement of it and were eventually defeated in a major battle that was fought in front of the Baxter Building  This led all the remaining superheroes to go underground   edit  The 1992 X Men animated series The first episode of the 1992 X Men Animated Series  Night of The Sentinels  part 1   original airdate  31 October 1992  mentions that some form of registration is in effect already  In the episode  Jubilee s foster parents worry that they may have to  register her with the Mutant Control Agency  after she manifests her powers for the first time  But following the attack on Jubilee at a mall  it was revealed that the hidden agenda of Henry Peter Gyrich  the founder of the agency is to deceive the mutants into revealing their identities so the Sentinels could eliminate them due to Gyrich s beliefs that mutants pose a threat to society  After the destruction of their files  following the X Men s raid on the agency  the President decides to cancel the registration act  The government s persecution of mutants is a consistent theme throughout the fifth season of the series   edit  The X Men movies The events of the first X Men film are precipitated when Senator Robert Kelly introduces a Mutant Registration Act to the Senate  This motivates Magneto  who sees such legislation as persecutory towards mutants  to kidnap Kelly and replace him with Mystique  who while impersonating Kelly  withdraws his advocacy for the Act  In the sequel  X2  the Mutant Registration Act is briefly mentioned when Storm speculates that Nightcrawler s attack on the White House might lead the government to reintroduce the legislation   edit  Non Marvel equivalents In many other super hero universes the government has intervened to regulate or control the activities of super heroes  Some examples of this include   edit  DC Universe In DC Comics  DC Universe the Justice Society of America chose to disband in 1951 rather than appear in front of the House Un American Activities Committee  which demanded that they unmask themselves  This was first shown in a back up story in Adventure Comics  vol  1   466   The Defeat of the Justice Society    December 1979  by writer Paul Levitz and subsequently further explored in the America vs  The Justice Society 4 issue limited series  January April 1985  by writers Roy and Dann Thomas  There is also a piece of legislation called the  Keene Act   an apparent reference to Watchmen  see below  in the DC Universe  First mentioned in Suicide Squad  vol  1   1  May 1987  in a story written by John Ostrander  the  Act  is referred to as a piece of legislation from 1961 which gives prisons greater leeway in imprisoning superhumans than ordinary prisoners  It was more fully explored in Secret Origins  vol  3   14  May 1987   again written by Ostrander  where it is revealed that the Act was passed in 1961 and it reaffirmed the right  that had been cast into doubt by HUAC in 1951  of superheroes to operate with secret identities  That story also reveals that the later  Ingersoll Amendment   a reference to lawyer and comics writer Bob Ingersoll  to the Keene Act  which delineates governmental authority over superhuman activity in times of crisis  was passed into law in 1972   edit  The Return Of Captain Invincible In the 1983 comedy film The Return Of Captain Invincible starring Alan Arkin and Christopher Lee  Captain Invincible  Arkin  is a super hero who was forced into retirement in the 1950s following the government s persecution of him  In a similar scenario as that faced by the Justice Society  Captain Invincible faced a McCarthy ish congressional investigation which accused him of being a communist  because of his red cape  and charged him for violating U S  airspace by flying without a proper license  As the title suggests a crisis forces Captain Invincible out of retirement in the 1980s which leads to him redeeming his reputation   edit  Watchmen In Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons  12 issue Watchmen series  September 1986   October 1987   extensive reference is made to a law called the Keene Act  The series reveals that the actions of superheroes or  costumed vigilantes  in the world of Watchmen caused a New York City police strike in 1977  which led to rioting  shown in Watchmen  2  October 1986  and the passing of the Keene Act which outlaws non government affiliated vigilantes  mentioned in Watchmen  4  December 1986   The passing of the act led to the retirement of most of the US superheroes  and the series depicts them coming out of retirement when the Comedian  one of the few government sponsored vigilantes  is murdered at the beginning of the comic   edit  City of Heroes Following World War II  in the City of Heroes universe  the United States intelligence community feared the Soviet bloc would gain an advantage in meta human assets  To address this issue  the government passed the Might for Right Act  This law proclaimed any U S  citizen with meta human powers or paranormal abilities  super powered individuals and vigilante heroes a valuable national resource subject to draft without notice into the service of the United States government  The law was later struck down by the U S  Supreme Court after numerous protests and complaints regarding the law s civil rights abuses  Currently in effect in the setting is the Citizen Crime Fighting Act  which provides vigilantes who choose to register  whether technically superhuman or not  with police powers  Unlike the Might for Right act or the Marvel act the CCFA does not require heroes to work for the government   edit  Astro City In writer Kurt Busiek s Astro City Vol  2  6 9  February   May  1996  the registration of super humans is mandated by the city s Mayor Stevenson  11  In those comic book issues  a super human serial killer is thought to be active in the city and the Mayor proposes that registration will help apprehend the killer  Stevenson brings in federal E A G L E  agents to enforce the new requirement  which is opposed by many active super heroes  The prominent hero Winged Victory makes outspoken statements opposing registration and several super humans flout the law and illegally continue their activities without registration  In Astro City  8 the Mayor is revealed as an alien infiltrator whose actions are part of a planned extraterrestrial invasion  The mayor s policy discredited  Astro City s super human population unite to defeat the invasion in Astro City  9  Registration is abandoned at the storyline s conclusion and has not been mentioned again in the series  The issues involved were later collected in the trade paperback Astro City  Confession  ISBN 1 56389 550 1    edit  Brave New World In the Brave New World superhero role playing game originally released by Pinnacle Entertainment Group in 1999 the setting of a dystopian alternate timeline includes a fascist United States government which passed the  Delta Registration Act  after a group of supervillains attempted to assassinate President John F  Kennedy on November 22  1963  In the game the law requires that anybody with super human abilities must register themselves to the United States Government  Its restrictive provisions include requirements that registrants surrender certain civil rights and notify the police of their whereabouts regularly  The law also mandates that super powered individuals register within 7 days of first manifesting their abilities  with the penalty for failing to do so being an automatic sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole  The Act also legislates for the mandatory military conscription of individual super powered individuals at any time should their abilities be judged necessary by the government  In the world of the game most other nations have similar laws  though they are far less draconian in their restrictions and enforcement   edit  Powers In Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Avon Oeming s Powers series  superheroes had to register with the government in order to be able to operate  This was changed following the events of Powers  vol  1   30  March  2003  in which Super Shock  the world s most trusted superhero  goes on a massive worldwide killing spree  At that point  the US government prohibited super beings from using their powers and operating as superheroes  This leads all the world s heroes to retire and attempt to live normal lives  though after Powers  vol  2   6  November  2004  some begin to re emerge   edit  The Incredibles In the world depicted in the 2004 Pixar animated feature film The Incredibles superheroes are shown in flashback as originally having been required to register with the National Supers Agency  or  NSA   a joke reference to the real life National Security Agency  in order to fight crime legally  However  following the Sansweet v  Incredible court case  in which superheroes were found to be legally liable for the personal injury claims of people who were injured during the course of their activities  most superheroes were forced into retirement due to the potentially massive legal liabilities they faced  In the movie it is explained that to assist the superheroes in their retirement  the United States government set up a  Superhero Relocation Program   similar in many ways to the non fictional Witness Protection Program  which granted heroes amnesty from legal claims provided they permanently retire from hero work and live anonymously  By the end of the film  the protagonists have returned to their roles as superheroes  and the program appears to have been nullified   edit  Absolution In the world depicted in Absolution  Christopher Gage s creator owned limited series by Avatar Press  super heroes are part of the police force  While the government is aware of their real identities  superheroes are not obligated to reveal their identities to the public   edit  Smallville In the television series Smallville The Vigilante Registrations Act  VRA  is proposed legislation that would require vigilantes to register themselves  episode needed   edit  References    WIZARD WORLD L A   DAY TWO  DAVID HINE MARKS  CIVIL
