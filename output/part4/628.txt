country s most internationally renowned genres are hip hop  blues  country  rhythm and blues  jazz  barbershop  pop  techno  and rock and roll  The United States has the world s largest music industry and its music is heard around the world  Since the beginning of the 20th century  some forms of American popular music have gained a near global audience  1  Native Americans were the earliest inhabitants of the land that is today known as the United States and played its first music  Beginning in the 17th century  immigrants from the United Kingdom  Ireland  Spain  Germany and France began arriving in large numbers  bringing with them new styles and instruments  African slaves brought musical traditions  and each subsequent wave of immigrants contributed to a melting pot  Much of modern popular music can trace its roots to the emergence in the late 19th century of African American blues and the growth of gospel music in the 1920s  The African American basis for popular music used elements derived from European and indigenous musics  The United States has also seen documented folk music and recorded popular music produced in the ethnic styles of the Ukrainian  Irish  Scottish  Polish  Hispanic and Jewish communities  among others  Many American cities and towns have vibrant music scenes which  in turn  support a number of regional musical styles  Along with musical centers such as Seattle  New York City  San Francisco  New Orleans  Detroit  Minneapolis  Chicago  Nashville  Austin  and Los Angeles  many smaller cities such as Asbury Park  New Jersey have produced distinctive styles of music  The Cajun and Creole traditions in Louisiana music  the folk and popular styles of Hawaiian music  and the bluegrass and old time music of the Southeastern states are a few examples of diversity in American music  Contents 1 Characteristics 1 1 Social identity 2 Diversity 3 Folk music 3 1 Blues and spirituals 3 2 Other immigrant communities 4 Classical music 4 1

Characteristics The music of the United States can be characterized by the use of syncopation and asymmetrical rhythms  long  irregular melodies  which are said to  reflect the wide open geography of  the American landscape   and the  sense of personal freedom characteristic of American life   2  Some distinct aspects of American music  like the call and response format  are derived from African techniques and instruments  Throughout the later part of American history  and into modern times  the relationship between American and European music has been a discussed topic among scholars of American music  Some have urged for the adoption of more purely European techniques and styles  which are sometimes perceived as more refined or elegant  while others have pushed for a sense of musical nationalism that celebrates distinctively American styles  Modern classical music scholar John Warthen Struble has contrasted American and European  concluding that the music of the United States is inherently distinct because the United States has not had centuries of musical evolution as a nation  Instead  the music of the United States is that of dozens or hundreds of indigenous and immigrant groups  all of which developed largely in regional isolation until the American Civil War  when people from across the country were brought together in army units  trading musical styles and practices  Struble deemed the ballads of the Civil War  the first American folk music with discernible features that can be considered unique to America  the first  American  sounding music  as distinct from any regional style derived from another country   3  The Civil War  and the period following it  saw a general flowering of American art  literature and music  Amateur musical ensembles of this era can be seen as the birth of American popular music  Music author David Ewen describes these early amateur bands as combining  the depth and drama of the classics with undemanding technique  eschewing complexity in favor of direct expression  If it was vocal music  the words would be in English  despite the snobs who declared English an unsingable language  In a way  it was part of the entire awakening of America that happened after the Civil War  a time in which American painters  writers and  serious  composers addressed specifically American themes   4  During this period the roots of blues  gospel  jazz and country music took shape  in the 20th century  these became the core of American popular music  which further evolved into the styles like rhythm and blues  rock and roll and hip hop music   edit  Social identity Music intertwines with aspects of American social and cultural identity  including through social class  race and ethnicity  geography  religion  language  gender and sexuality  The relationship between music and race is perhaps the most potent determiner of musical meaning in the United States  The development of an African American musical identity  out of disparate sources from Africa and Europe  has been a constant theme in the music history of the United States  Little documentation exists of colonial era African American music  when styles  songs and instruments from across West Africa commingled in the melting pot of slavery  By the mid 19th century  a distinctly African American folk tradition was well known and widespread  and African American musical techniques  instruments and images became a part of mainstream American music through spirituals  minstrel shows and slave songs  5  African American musical styles became an integral part of American popular music through blues  jazz  rhythm and blues  and then rock and roll  soul and hip hop  all of these styles were consumed by Americans of all races  but were created in African American styles and idioms before eventually becoming common in performance and consumption across racial lines  In contrast  country music derives from both African and European  as well as Native American and Hawaiian  traditions and yet has long been perceived as a form of white music  6  Economic and social class separates American music through the creation and consumption of music  such as the upper class patronage of symphony goers  and the generally poor performers of rural and ethnic folk musics  Musical divisions based on class are not absolute  however  and are sometimes as much perceived as actual  7  popular American country music  for example  is a commercial genre designed to  appeal to a working class identity  whether or not its listeners are actually working class   8  Country music is also intertwined with geographic identity  and is specifically rural in origin and function  other genres  like R amp B and hip hop  are perceived as inherently urban  9  For much of American history  music making has been a  feminized activity   10  In the 19th century  amateur piano and singing were considered proper for middle  and upper class women  Women were also a major part of early popular music performance  though recorded traditions quickly become more dominated by men  Most male dominated genres of popular music include female performers as well  often in a niche appealing primarily to women  these include gangsta rap and heavy metal  11   edit  Diversity The United States is often said to be a cultural melting pot  taking in influences from across the world and creating distinctively new methods of cultural expression  Though aspects of American music can be traced back to specific origins  claiming any particular original culture for a musical element is inherently problematic  due to the constant evolution of American music through transplanting and hybridizing techniques  instruments and genres  Elements of foreign musics arrived in the United States both through the formal sponsorship of educational and outreach events by individuals and groups  and through informal processes  as in the incidental transplantation of West African music through slavery  and Irish music through immigration  The most distinctly American musics are a result of cross cultural hybridization through close contact  Slavery  for example  mixed persons from numerous tribes in tight living quarters  resulting in a shared musical tradition that was enriched through further hybridizing with elements of indigenous  Latin and European music  12  American ethnic  religious and racial diversity has also produced such intermingled genres as the French African music of the Louisiana Creoles  the Native  Mexican and European fusion Tejano music and the thoroughly hybridized slack key guitar and other styles of modern Hawaiian music  The process of transplanting music between cultures is not without criticism  The folk revival of the mid 20th century  for example  appropriated the musics of various rural peoples  in part to promote certain political causes  which has caused some to question whether the process caused the  commercial commodification of other peoples  songs    and the inevitable dilution of mean  in the appropriated musics  The issue of cultural appropriation has also been a major part of racial relations in the United States  The use of African American musical techniques  images and conceits in popular music largely by and for white Americans has been widespread since at least the mid 19th century songs of Stephen Foster and the rise of minstrel shows  The American music industry has actively attempted to popularize white performers of African American music because they are more palatable to mainstream and middle class Americans  This process has produced such varied stars as Benny Goodman  Eminem and Elvis Presley  as well as popular styles like blue eyed soul and rockabilly  12   edit  Folk music Main article  American folk music Folk music in the US is varied across the country s numerous ethnic groups  The Native American tribes each play their own varieties of folk music  most of it spiritual in nature  African American music includes blues and gospel  descendts of West African music brought to the Americas by slaves and mixed with Western European music  During the colonial era  English  French and Spanish styles and instruments were brought to the Americas  By the early 20th century  the United States had become a major center for folk music from around the world  including polka  Ukrainian and Polish fiddling  Ashkenazi Jewish klezmer and several kinds of Latin music  The Native Americans played the first folk music in what is now the United States  using a wide variety of styles and techniques  Some commonalities are near universal among Native American traditional music  however  especially the lack of harmony and polyphony  and the use of vocables and descending melodic figures  Traditional instrumentations uses the flute and many kinds of percussion instruments  like drums  rattles and shakers  13  Since European and African contact was established  Native American folk music has grown in new directions  into fusions with disparate styles like European folk dances and Tejano music  Modern Native American music may be best known for powwow gatherings  pan tribal gatherings at which traditionally styled dances and music are performed  14   Bice waan Song  This is an 1897 recording of a traditional Omaha courtship song   On the

culture became a major foundation for American folk and popular music  Many American folk songs are identical to British songs in arrangements  but with new lyrics  often as parodies of the original material  American Anglo songs are also characterized as having fewer pentatonic tunes  less prominent accompaniment  but with heavier use of drones  and more melodies in major  15  Anglo American traditional music also includes a variety of broadside ballads  humorous stories and tall tales  and disaster songs regarding mining  shipwrecks and murder  Legendary heroes like Joe Magarac  John Henry and Jesse James are part of many songs  Folk dances of British origin include the square dance  descended from the quadrille  combined with the American innovation of a caller instructing the dancers  16  The religious communal society known as the Shakers emigrated from England during the 18th century and developed their own folk dance style  Their early songs can be dated back to British folk song models  17  Other religious societies established their own unique musical cultures early in American history  such as the music of the Amish  the Harmony Society  and of the Ephrata Cloister in Pennsylvania  18  The ancestors of today s African American population were brought to the United States as slaves  working primarily in the plantations of the South  They were from hundreds of tribes across West Africa  and they brought with them certain traits of West African music including call and response vocals and complexly rhythmic music  19  as well as syncopated beats and shifting accents  20  The African musical focus on rhythmic singing and dancing was brought to the New World  and where it became part of a distinct folk culture that helped Africans  retain continuity with their past through music   The first slaves in the United States sang work songs  field hollers 21  and  following Christianization  hymns  In the 19th century  a Great Awakening of religious fervor gripped people across the country  especially in the South  Protestant hymns written mostly by New England preachers became a feature of camp meetings held among devout Christians across the South  When blacks began singing adapted versions of these hymns  they were called Negro spirituals  It was from these roots  of spiritual songs  work songs and field hollers  that blues  jazz and gospel developed   edit  Blues and spirituals Main articles  Blues and spiritual  music   We are Americans  Ethnographic recordings collected for the Library of Congress s Archive of American Folk Song      Problems listening to this file  See media help  Spirituals were primarily expressions of religious faith  sung by slaves on southern plantations  22  In the mid to late 19th century  spirituals spread out of the U S  South  In 1871 Fisk University became home to the Jubilee Singers  a pioneering group that popularized spirituals across the country  In imitation of this group  gospel quartets arose  followed by increasing diversification with the early 20th century rise of jackleg and singing preachers  from whence came the popular style of gospel music   pharoah s army got

hollers and shouts  23  It developed in the rural South in the first decade of the 20th century  The most important characteristics of the blues is its use of the blue scale  with a flatted or indeterminate third  as well as the typically lamenting lyrics  though both of these elements had existed in African American folk music prior to the 20th century  the codified form of modern blues  such as with the AAB structure  did not exist until the early 20th century  24   edit  Other immigrant communities Main article  Music of immigrant communities in the United States The United States is a melting pot consisting of numerous ethnic groups  Many of these peoples have kept alive the folk traditions of their homeland  often producing distinctively American styles of foreign music  Some nationalities have produced local scenes in regions of the country where they have clustered  like Cape Verdean music in New England  25 Armenian music in California  26  and Italian and Ukrainian music in New York City  27  The Creoles are a community with varied non Anglo ancestry  mostly descendant of people who lived in Louisiana before its purchase by the U S  The Cajuns are a group of Francophones who arrived in Louisiana after leaving Acadia in Canada  28  The city of New Orleans  Louisiana  being a major port  has acted as a melting pot for people from all over the Caribbean basin  The result is a diverse and syncretic set of styles of Cajun and Creole music  Spain and subsequently Mexico controlled much of what is now the western United States until the Mexican American War  including the entire state of Texas  After Texas joined the United States  the native Tejanos living in the state began culturally developing separately from their neighbors to the south  and remained culturally distinct from other Texans  Central to the evolution of early Tejano music was the blend of traditional Mexican forms such as mariachi and the corrido  and Continental European styles introduced by German and Czech settlers in the late 19th century  29  In particular  the accordion was adopted by Tejano folk musicians at the turn of the 20th century  and it became a popular instrument for amateur musicians in Texas and Northern Mexico   edit  Classical music Main article  American classical music The European classical music tradition was brought to the United States with some of the first colonists  European classical music is rooted in the traditions of European art  ecclesiastical and concert music  The central norms of this tradition developed between 1550 and 1825  centering on what is known as the common practice period  Many American classical composers attempted to work entirely within European models until late in the 19th century  When Anton n Dvo  k  a prominent Czech composer  visited the United States from 1892 to 1895  he iterated the idea that American classical music needed its own models instead of imitating European composers  he helped to inspire subsequent composers to make a distinctly American style of classical music  30  By the beginning of the 20th century  many American composers were incorporating disparate elements into their work  ranging from jazz and blues to Native American music   edit  Early classical music During the colonial era  there were two distinct fields of what is now considered classical music  One was associated with amateur composers and pedagogues  whose style was based around simple hymns that were performed with increasing sophistication over time  The other colonial tradition was that of the mid Atlantic cities like Philadelphia and Baltimore  which produced a number of prominent composers who worked almost entirely within the European model  these composers were mostly English in origin  and worked specifically in the style of prominent English composers of the day  31  European classical music was brought to the United States during the colonial era  Many American composers of this period worked exclusively with European models  while others  such as William Billings  Supply Belcher and Justin Morgan  also known as the First New England School  developed a style almost entirely independent of European models  32  Of these composers  Billings is the most well remembered  he was also influential  as the founder of the American church choir  as the first musician to use a pitch pipe  and as the first to introduce a violoncello into church service   33  Many of these composers were amateur singers who developed new forms of sacred music suitable for performance by amateurs  and often using harmonic methods which would have been considered bizarre by contemporary European standards  34  These composers  styles were untouched by  the influence of their sophisticated European contemporaries   using modal or pentatonic scales or melodies and eschewing the European rules of harmony  35  In the early 19th century  America produced diverse composers such as Anthony Philip Heinrich  who composed in an idiosyncratic  intentionally  American  style and was the first American composer to write for a symphony orchestra  Many other composers  most famously William Henry Fry and George Frederick Bristow  supported the idea of an American classical style  though their works were very European in orientation  It was John Knowles Paine  however  who became the first American composer to be accepted in Europe  Paine s example inspired the composers of the Second New England School  which included such figures as Amy Beach  Edward MacDowell  and Horatio Parker  36  Louis Moreau Gottschalk is perhaps the best remembered American composer of the 19th century  said by music historian Richard Crawford to be known for  bringing indigenous or folk  themes and rhythms into music for the concert hall   Gottschalk s music reflected the cultural mix of his home city  New Orleans  Louisiana  which was home to a variety of Latin  Caribbean  African American  Cajun and Creole musics  He was well acknowledged as a talented pianist in his lifetime  and was also a known composer who remains admired though little performed  37   edit  20th century The New York classical music scene included Charles Griffes  originally from Elmira  New York  who began publishing his most innovative material in 1914  His early collaborations were attempts to use non Western musical themes  The best known New York composer was George Gershwin  Gershwin was a songwriter with Tin Pan Alley and the Broadway theatres  and his works were strongly influenced by jazz  or rather the precursors to jazz that were extant during his time  Gershwin s work made American classical music more focused  and attracted an unheard of amount of international attention  Following Gershwin  the first major composer was Aaron Copland from Brooklyn  who used elements of American folk music  though it remained European in technique and form  Later  he turned to the ballet and then serial music  38 Charles Ives was one of the earliest American classical composers of enduring international significance  producing music in a uniquely American style  though his music was mostly unknown until after his death in 1954  Many of the later 20th century composers  such as John Cage  John Corigliano and Steve Reich  used modernist and minimalist techniques  Reich discovered a technique known as phasing  in which two musical activities begin simultaneously and are repeated  gradually drifting out of sync  creating a natural sense of development  Reich was also very interested in non Western music  incorporating African rhythmic techniques in his compositions  39  Recent composers and performers are strongly influenced by the minimalist works of Philip Glass  a Baltimore native based out of New York  Meredith Monk and others  40   edit  Popular music Main article  American popular music The United States has produced many popular musicians and composers in the modern world  Beginning with the birth of recorded music  American performers have continued to lead the field of popular music  which out of  all the contributions made by Americans to world culture    has been taken to heart by the entire world   41  Most histories of popular music start with American ragtime or Tin Pan Alley  others  however  trace popular music back to the European Renaissance and through broadsheets  ballads and other popular traditions  42  Other authors typically look at popular sheet music  tracing American popular music to spirituals  minstrel shows and vaudeville  or the patriotic songs of the Civil War   edit  Early popular song  The Star Spangled Banner  The Star Spangled Banner performed by Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians  1942   Stars and Stripes Forever  John

listening to these files  See media help  Sheet music for  Dixie  The patriotic lay songs of the American Revolution constituted the first kind of mainstream popular music  These included  The Liberty Tree   by Thomas Paine  Cheaply printed as broadsheets  early patriotic songs spread across the colonies and were performed at home and at public meetings  43 Fife songs were especially celebrated  and were performed on fields of battle during the American Revolution  The longest lasting of these fife songs is  Yankee Doodle   still well known today  The melody dates back to 1755 and was sung by both American and British troops  44  Patriotic songs were mostly based on English melodies  with new lyrics added to denounce British colonialism  others  however  used tunes from Ireland  Scotland or elsewhere  or did not utilize a familiar melody  The song  Hail Columbia  was a major work 45  that remained an unofficial national anthem until the adoption of  The Star Spangled Banner   Much of this early American music still survives in Sacred Harp  During the Civil War  when soldiers from across the country commingled  the multifarious strands of American music began to cross fertilize each other  a process that was aided by the burgeoning railroad industry and other technological developments that made travel and communication easier  Army units included individuals from across the country  and they rapidly traded tunes  instruments and techniques  The war was an impetus for the creation of distinctly American songs that became and remained wildly popular  3  The most popular songs of the Civil War era included  Dixie   written by Daniel Decatur Emmett  The song  originally titled  Dixie s Land   was made for the closing of a minstrel show  it spread to New Orleans first  where it was published and became  one of the great song successes of the pre Civil War period   46  In addition to popular patriotic songs  the Civil War era also produced a great body of brass band pieces  47  19th century song composer Stephen Foster Following the Civil War  minstrel shows became the first distinctively American form of music expression  The minstrel show was an indigenous form of American entertainment consisting of comic skits  variety acts  dancing  and music  usually performed by white people in blackface  Minstrel shows used African American elements in musical performances  but only in simplified ways  storylines in the shows depicted blacks as natural born slaves and fools  before eventually becoming associated with abolitionism  48  The minstrel show was invented by Dan Emmett and the Virginia Minstrels  49  Minstrel shows produced the first well remembered popular songwriters in American music history  Thomas D  Rice  Dan Emmett  and  most famously  Stephen Foster  After minstrel shows  popularity faded  coon songs  a similar phenomenon  became popular  The composer John Philip Sousa is closely associated with the most popular trend in American popular music just before the turn of the century  Formerly the bandmaster of the United States Marine Band  Sousa wrote military marches like  Stars and Stripes Forever  that reflected his  nostalgia for  his  home and country   giving the melody a  stirring virile character   50  In the early 20th century  American musical theater was a major source for popular songs  many of which influenced blues  jazz  country  and other extant styles of popular music  The center of development for this style was in New York City  where the Broadway theatres became among the most renowned venues in the city  Theatrical composers and lyricists like the brothers George and Ira Gershwin created a uniquely American theatrical style that used American vernacular speech and music  Musicals featured popular songs and fast paced plots that often revolved around love and romance  51   edit  Blues and gospel  Maple Leaf Rag  Ragtime composition by Scott Joplin Problems listening to this file  See media help  Main articles  Blues and gospel music The blues is a genre of African American folk music that is the basis for much of modern American popular music  Blues can be seen as part of a continuum of musical styles like country  jazz  ragtime  and gospel  though each genre evolved into distinct forms  their origins were often indistinct  Early forms of the blues evolved in and around the Mississippi Delta in the late 19th and early 20th centuries  The earliest blues like music was primarily call and response vocal music  without harmony or accompaniment and without any formal musical structure  Slaves and their descendants created the blues by adapting the field shouts and hollers  turning them into passionate solo songs  52  When mixed with the Christian spiritual songs of African American churches and revival meetings  blues became the basis of gospel music  Modern gospel began in African American churches in the 1920s  in the form of worshipers proclaiming their faith in an improvised  often musical manner  testifying   Composers like Thomas A  Dorsey composed gospel works that used elements of blues and jazz in traditional hymns and spiritual songs  53  Ragtime was a style of music based around the piano  using syncopated rhythms and chromaticisms  24  It is primarily a form of dance music utilizing the walking bass  and is generally composed in sonata form  Ragtime is a refined and evolved form of the African American cakewalk dance  mixed with styles ranging from European marches 54  and popular songs to jigs and other dances played by large African American bands in northern cities during the end of the 19th century  The most famous ragtime performer and composer was Scott Joplin  known for works such as  Maple Leaf Rag   55  Blues singer Bessie Smith Blues became a part of American popular music in the 1920s  when classic female blues singers like Bessie Smith grew popular  At the same time  record companies launched the field of race music  which was mostly blues targeted at African American audiences  The most famous of these acts went on to inspire much of the later popular development of the blues and blues derived genres  including the legendary delta blues artist Robert Johnson and piedmont blues artist Blind Willie McTell  By the end of the 1940s  however  pure blues was only a minor part of popular music  having been subsumed by offshoots like rhythm  amp  blues and the nascent rock and roll style  Some styles of electric  piano driven blues  like the boogie woogie  retained a large audience  A bluesy style of gospel also became popular in mainstream America in the 1950s  led by singer Mahalia Jackson  56  The blues genre experienced major revivals in the 1950s with Chicago blues artists such as Muddy Waters and Little Walter as well as in the 1960s in the stream of the British Invasion and American folk music revival when country bluesmen like Mississippi John Hurt and Reverend Gary Davis were rediscovered  The seminal blues artists of these periods had tremendous influence on rock musicians such as Chuck Berry in the 1950s  as well as on the British blues and blues rock scenes of the 1960s and  70s  including among others Eric Clapton in Britain and Johnny Winter in Texas   edit  Jazz  Bird of Paradise  By one of the early innovators of bebop  Charlie Parker Problems listening to this file  See media help  Main article  Jazz Jazz is a kind of music characterized by swung and blue notes  call and response vocals  polyrhythms and improvisation  Though originally a kind of dance music  jazz has been a major part of popular music  and has also become a major element of Western classical music  Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression  and in African American music traditions including blues and ragtime  as well as European military band music  57  Early jazz was closely related to ragtime  with which it could be distinguished by the use of more intricate rhythmic improvisation  The earliest jazz bands adopted much of the vocabulary of the blues  including bent and blue notes and instrumental  growls  and smears otherwise not used on European instruments  Jazz s roots come from the city of New Orleans  Louisiana  populated by Cajuns and black Creoles  who combined the French Canadian culture of the Cajuns with their own styles of music in the 19th century  Large Creole bands that played for funerals and parades became a major basis for early jazz  which spread from New Orleans to Chicago and other northern urban centers  Trumpeter Miles Davis Though jazz had long since achieved some limited popularity  it was Louis Armstrong who became one of the first popular stars and a major force in the development of jazz  along with his friend pianist Earl Hines  Armstrong  Hines and their colleagues were improvisers  capable of creating numerous variations on a single melody  Armstrong also popularized scat singing  an improvisational vocal technique in which nonsensical syllables  vocables  are sung  Armstrong and Hines were influential in the rise of a kind of pop big band jazz called swing  Swing is characterized by a strong rhythm section  usually consisting of double bass and drums  medium to fast tempo  and rhythmic devices like the swung note  which is common to most jazz  Swing is primarily a fusion of 1930s jazz fused with elements of the blues and Tin Pan Alley  55  Swing used bigger bands than other kinds of jazz  leading to bandleaders tightly arranging the material which discouraged improvisation  previously an integral part of jazz  Swing became a major part of African American dance  and came to be accompanied by a popular dance called the swing dance  Jazz influenced many performers of all the major styles of later popular music  though jazz itself never again became such a major part of American popular music as during the swing era  The later 20th century American jazz scene did  however  produce some popular crossover stars  such as Miles Davis  In the middle of the 20th century  jazz evolved into a variety of subgenres  beginning with bebop  Bebop is a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos  improvisation based on harmonic structure rather than melody  and use of the flatted fifth  Bebop was developed in the early and mid 1940s  later evolving into styles like hard bop and free jazz  Innovators of the style included Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie  who arose from small jazz clubs in New York City  58   edit  Country music Main article  Country music Country music is primarily a fusion of African American blues and spirituals with Appalachian folk music  adapted for pop audiences and popularized beginning in the 1920s  The origins of country are in rural Southern folk music  which was primarily Irish and British  with African and continental European musics  59  Anglo Celtic tunes  dance music  and balladry were the earliest predecessors of modern country  then known as hillbilly music  Early hillbilly also borrowed elements of the blues and drew upon more aspects of 19th century pop songs as hillbilly music evolved into a commercial genre eventually known as country and western and then simply country  60  The earliest country instrumentation revolved around the European derived fiddle and the African derived banjo  with the guitar later added  61  String instruments like the ukulele and steel guitar became commonplace due to the popularity of Hawaiian musical groups in the early 20th century  62  Neotraditional singer Randy Travis The roots of commercial country music are generally traced to 1927  when music talent scout Ralph Peer recorded Jimmie Rodgers and The Carter Family  63  Popular success was very limited  though a small demand spurred some commercial recording  After World War II  there was increased interest in specialty styles like country music  producing a few major pop stars  64  The most influential country musician of the era was Hank Williams  a bluesy country singer from Alabama  56  He remains renowned as one of country music s greatest songwriters and performers  viewed as a  folk poet  with a  honky tonk swagger  and  working class sympathies   65  Throughout the decade the roughness of honky tonk gradually eroded as the Nashville sound grew more pop oriented  Producers like Chet Atkins created the Nashville sound by stripping the hillbilly elements of the instrumentation and using smooth instrumentation and advanced production techniques  Eventually  most records from Nashville were in this style  which began to incorporate strings and vocal choirs  66  By the early part of the 1960s  however  the Nashville sound had become perceived as too watered down by many more traditionalist performers and fans  resulting in a number of local scenes like the Lubbock sound and the Bakersfield sound  A few performers retained popularity  however  such as the long standing cultural icon Johnny Cash  67  The Bakersfield sound began in the mid to late 1950s when performers like Wynn Stewart and Buck Owens began using elements of Western swing and rock  such as the breakbeat  in their music  68  In the  60s performers like Merle Haggard popularized the sound  In the early 1970s  Haggard was also part of outlaw country  alongside singer songwriters such as Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings  58  Outlaw country was rock oriented and lyrically focused on the criminal antics of the performers  in contrast to the clean cut country singers of the Nashville sound  69  By the middle of the 1980s  the country music charts were dominated by pop singers  alongside a nascent revival of honky tonk style country with the rise of performers like Dwight Yoakam  The 1980s also saw the development of alternative country performers like Uncle Tupelo  who were opposed to the more pop oriented style of mainstream country  At the beginning of the 2000s  pop oriented country acts remained among the best selling performers in the United States  especially Garth Brooks  70   edit  R amp B and soul Main articles  Rhythm and blues  soul music  and funk  A

funk   Luv n  Haight  The 1971 funk song by Sly  amp  the Family Stone is satirically titled as a reference to the Haight Ashbury scene  while the music and lyrics express disillusionment with the 1960s counterculture  71  72  Problems listening to these files  See media help  R amp B  an abbreviation for rhythm and blues  is a style that arose in the 1930s and 1940s  Early R amp B consisted of large rhythm units  smashing away behind screaming blues singers  who  had to shout to be heard above the clanging and strumming of the various electrified instruments and the churning rhythm sections   73  R amp B was not extensively recorded and promoted because record companies felt that it was not suited for most audiences  especially middle class whites  because of the suggestive lyrics and driving rhythms  74  Bandleaders like Louis Jordan innovated the sound of early R amp B  using a band with a small horn section and prominent rhythm instrumentation  By the end of the 1940s  he had had several hits  and helped pave the way for contemporaries like Wynonie Harris and John Lee Hooker  Many of the most popular R amp B songs were not performed in the rollicking style of Jordan and his contemporaries  instead they were performed by white musicians like Pat Boone in a more palatable mainstream style  which turned into pop hits  75  By the end of the 1950s  however  there was a wave of popular black blues rock and country influenced R amp B performers like Chuck Berry gaining unprecedented fame among white listeners  76  Soul music is a combination of rhythm and blues and gospel which began in the late 1950s in the United States  It is characterized by its use of gospel music devices  with a greater emphasis on vocalists and the use of secular themes  The 1950s recordings of Ray Charles  Sam Cooke  and James Brown are commonly considered the beginnings of soul  Charles  Modern Sounds  1962  records featured a fusion of soul and country music  country soul  and crossed racial barriers in music at the time  77  One of Cooke s most well known songs  A Change Is Gonna Come   1964  became accepted as a classic and an anthem of the civil rights movement of the 1960s  78  According to Allmusic  James Brown was critical  through  the gospel impassioned fury of his vocals and the complex polyrhythms of his beats   in  two revolutions in black American music  He was one of the figures most responsible for turning R amp B into soul and he was  most would agree  the figure most responsible for turning soul music into the funk of the late  60s and early  70s   79  The Motown Record Corporation of Detroit  Michigan became highly successful during the early and mid 1960s by releasing soul recordings with heavy pop influences to make them palatable to white audiences  allowing black artists to more easily crossover to white audiences  80  James Brown was critical in the transition of rhythm and blues to soul music and pioneering funk music  79  Pure soul was popularized by Otis Redding and the other artists of Stax Records in Memphis  Tennessee  By the late 1960s  Atlantic recording artist Aretha Franklin had emerged as the most popular female soul star in the country  81  Also by this time  soul had splintered into several genres  82  influenced by psychedelic rock and other styles  The social and political ferment of the 1960s inspired artists like Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield to release albums with hard hitting social commentary  while another variety became more dance oriented music  evolving into funk  Despite his previous affinity with politically and socially charged lyrical themes  Gaye helped popularize sexual and romance themed music and funk  83  while his 1970s recordings  including Let s Get It On  1973  and I Want You  1976  helped develop the quiet storm sound and format  84  One of the most influential albums ever recorded  Sly  amp  the Family Stone s There s a Riot Goin  On  1971  has been considered among the first and best examples of the matured version of funk music  after prototypical instances of the sound in the group s earlier work  85 Spoken word soul  an eclectic blend of poetry  jazz funk and soul was practiced by such artists as Gil Scott Heron and The Last Poets  and featured critical political and social commentary with afrocentric sentiment  Scott Heron s proto rap work  including  The Revolution Will Not Be Televised   1971  and Winter in America  1974   has had a considerable impact on later hip hop artists  86  while his unique sound with Brian Jackson influenced neo soul artists  87  During the mid 1970s  highly slick and commercial bands such as Philly soul group The O Jays and blue eyed soul group Hall  amp  Oates achieved mainstream success  By the end of the  70s  most music genres  including soul  had been disco influenced  With the introduction of influences from electro music and funk in the late 1970s and early 1980s  soul music became less raw and more slickly produced  resulting in a genre of music that was once again called R amp B  usually distinguished from the earlier rhythm and blues by identifying it as contemporary R amp B  The first contemporary R amp B stars arose in the 1980s  with the funk influenced singer Prince  dance pop star Michael Jackson  and a wave of female vocalists like Tina Turner and Whitney Houston  70  Michael Jackson and Prince has been described as the most influential figures in contemporary R amp B and popular music because of their eclectic use of elements from a variety of genres  88  Prince was largely responsible for creating the Minneapolis sound   a blend of horns  guitars  and electronic synthesizers supported by a steady  bouncing rhythm   89  Jackson s work focused on smooth balladry or disco influenced dance music  as an artist  he  pulled dance music out of the disco doldrums with his 1979 solo debut  Off the Wall  merged R amp B with rock on Thriller  and introduced stylized steps such as the robot and moonwalk over the course of his career   90  Alicia Keys won numerous awards and established herself as one of the best selling artists of her time  91  92  93  while distinguishing herself from her R amp B contemporaries as a multi instrumentalist and singer songwriter  94  Janet Jackson collaborated with former Prince associates Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis on her third studio album Control  1986   the album s second single  Nasty  has been described as the origin of the new jack swing sound  a genre innovated by Teddy Riley  88  Riley s work on Keith Sweat s Make It Last Forever  1987   Guy s Guy  1988   and Bobby Brown s Don t Be Cruel  1998  made new jack swing a staple of contemporary R amp B into the mid 1990s  88  New jack swing was a style and trend of vocal music  often featuring rapped verses and drum machines  56  The crossover appeal of early contemporary R amp B artists in mainstream popular music  including works by Prince  Michael and Janet Jackson  Whitney Houston  Tina Turner  Anita Baker and The Pointer Sisters became a turning point for black artists in the industry  as their success  was perhaps the first hint that the greater cosmopolitanism of a world market might produce some changes in the complexion of popular music   95  The use of melisma  a gospel tradition adapted by vocalists Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey would become a cornerstone of contemporary R amp B singers beginning in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s  88  Hip hop came to influence contemporary R amp B later in the  80s  first through new jack swing and then in a related series of subgenres called hip hop soul and neo soul  Hip hop soul and neo soul developed later  in the 1990s  Typified by the work of Mary J  Blige and R  Kelly  the former is a mixture of contemporary R amp B with hip hop beats  while the images and themes of gangsta rap may be present  The latter is a more experimental  edgier and generally less mainstream combination of  60s and  70s style soul vocals with some hip hop influence  and has earned some mainstream recognition through the work of D Angelo  Erykah Badu  Alicia Keys  and Lauryn Hill  96  D Angelo s critically acclaimed album Voodoo  2000  has been recognized by music writers as a masterpiece and the cornerstone of the neo soul genre  97  98  99   edit  Rock  metal and punk Main articles  Rock music  heavy metal music  and punk rock Rock and roll developed out of country  blues  and R amp B  Rock s exact origins and early influences have been hotly debated  and are the subjects of much scholarship  Though squarely in the blues tradition  rock took elements from Afro Caribbean and Latin musical techniques  100  Rock was an urban style  formed in the areas where diverse populations resulted in the mixtures of African American  Latin and European genres ranging from the blues and country to polka and zydeco  101  Rock and roll first entered popular music through a style called rockabilly  which fused the nascent sound with elements of country music  Black performed rock and roll had previously had limited mainstream success  but it was the white performer Elvis Presley who first appealed to mainstream audiences with a black style of music  becoming one of the best selling musicians in history  and brought rock and roll to audiences across the world  102  Joan Baez and Bob Dylan were primary figures in the early 1960s American folk music revival  103  Dylan subsequently ventured into folk rock after being inspired by the British Invasion  particularly The Animals  hit recording of the folk song  The House of the Rising Sun   104  The 1960s saw several important changes in popular music  especially rock  Many of these changes took place through the British Invasion where bands such as The Beatles  The Who  The Rolling Stones  and later Led Zeppelin became immensely popular and had a profound effect on American culture and music These changes included the move from professionally composed songs to the singer songwriter  and the understanding of popular music as an art  rather than a form of commerce or pure entertainment  105  These changes led to the rise of musical movements connected to political goals  such as civil rights and the opposition to the Vietnam War  Rock was at the forefront of this change  In the early 60s  rock spawned several subgenres  beginning with surf  Surf was an instrumental guitar genre characterized by a distorted sound  associated with the Southern California surfing youth culture  106  Inspired by the lyrical focus of surf  The Beach Boys began recording in 1961 with an elaborate  pop friendly and harmonic sound  107  As their fame grew  The Beach Boys  songwriter Brian Wilson experimented with new studio techniques and became associated with the counterculture  The counterculture was a movement that embraced political activism  and was closely connected to the hippie subculture  The hippies were associated with folk rock  country rock  and psychedelic rock  Folk and country rock were associated with the rise of politicized folk music  led by Pete Seeger and others  especially at the Greenwich Village music scene in New York  Folk rock entered the mainstream in the middle of the 1960s  when the singer songwriter Bob Dylan began his career  Allmusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine attributes The Beatles  shift toward introspective songwriting in the mid 1960s to Bob Dylan s influence at the time  104  He was followed by a number of country rock bands and soft  folky singer songwriters  Psychedelic rock was a hard driving kind of guitar based rock  closely associated with the city of San Francisco  Though Jefferson Airplane was the only local band to have a major national hit  the Grateful Dead  a country and bluegrass flavored jam band  became an iconic part of the psychedelic counterculture  associated with hippies  LSD and other symbols of that era  108  Referred to as one of the most important and influential guitarists of all time  109  110  111  112 Eric Clapton established himself as a major rock star with groups such as The Yardbirds  Cream  and Derek  amp  the Dominoes  before embarking on a solo career in the 1970s  113  Following the turbulent political  social and musical changes of the 1960s and early 1970s  rock music diversified  What was formerly a discrete genre known as rock and roll evolved into a catchall category called simply rock music  which came to include diverse styles like heavy metal and punk rock  During the  70s most of these styles were evolving in the underground music scene  while mainstream audiences began the decade with a wave of singer songwriters who drew on the deeply emotional and personal lyrics of 1960s folk rock  The same period saw the rise of bombastic arena rock bands  bluesy Southern rock groups and mellow soft rock stars  Beginning in the later 1970s  the rock singer and songwriter Bruce Springsteen became a major star  with anthemic songs and dense  inscrutable lyrics that celebrated the poor and working class  70  Punk was a form of rebellious rock that began in the 1970s  and was loud  aggressive and often very simple  Punk began as a reaction against the popular music of the period  especially disco and arena rock  American bands in the field included  most famously  The Ramones and Talking Heads  the latter playing a more avant garde style that was closely associated with punk before evolving into mainstream New Wave  70  Other major acts include Blondie  Patti Smith and Television  In the 1980s some punk fans and bands became disillusioned with the growing popularity of the style  resulting in an even more aggressive style called hardcore punk  Hardcore was a form of sparse punk  consisting of short  fast  and intense songs that spoke to disaffected youth  with such influential bands as Bad Religion  Bad Brains  Black Flag  Dead Kennedys  and Minor Threat  Hardcore began in metropolises like Washington  D C   though most major American cities had their own local scenes in the 1980s  114  Hardcore  punk  and garage rock were the roots of alternative rock  a diverse grouping of rock subgenres that were explicitly opposed to mainstream music  and that arose from the punk and post punk styles  In the United States  many cities developed local alternative rock scenes  including Minneapolis and Seattle  115  Seattle s local scene produced grunge music  a dark and brooding style inspired by hardcore  psychedelia  and alternative rock  116  With the addition of a more melodic element to the sound of bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam  grunge became wildly popular across the United States 117  in 1991  Three years later  bands like Green Day  The Offspring  Rancid  Bad Religion and NOFX hit the mainstream  with their respective then new albums Dookie  Smash  Let s Go  Stranger than Fiction and Punk in Drublic  and brought the California punk scene exposure worldwide  Heavy metal is characterized by aggressive  driving rhythms  amplified and distorted guitars  grandiose lyrics and virtuosic instrumentation  Heavy metal s origins lie in the hard rock bands who took blues and rock and created a heavy sound centered around the guitar and drums  Most of the pioneers in the field were British  the first major American bands came in the early 1970s  like Blue  yster Cult  KISS and Aerosmith  Heavy metal remained  however  a largely underground phenomenon  During the 1980s the first major pop metal style arose and dominated the charts for several years kicked off by metal act Quiet Riot and dominated by bands such as M tley Cr e and Ratt  this was glam metal  a hard rock and pop fusion with a raucous spirit and a glam influenced visual aesthetic  Some of these bands  like Bon Jovi  became international stars  The band Guns N  Roses rose to fame near the end of the decade with an image that was a reaction against the glam metal aesthetic  By the mid 1980s heavy metal had branched in so many different directions that fans  record companies  and fanzines created numerous subgenres  The United States was especially known for one of these subgenres  thrash metal  which was innovated by bands like Anthrax  Metallica  Megadeth and Slayer  with Metallica being the most commercially successful  118  The United States was known as one of the birthplaces of Death Metal during the mid to late 1980s  The Florida scene was the most well known  featuring bands like Death  Morbid Angel  Deicide  Cannibal Corpse  Malevolent Creation  Obituary and many others  There are now countless death metal and deathgrind bands across the country   edit  Hip hop Main article  Hip hop music Jay Z  right

120  before attaining a similar level of success  121  Hip hop is a cultural movement  of which music is a part  Hip hop music for the most part is itself composed of two parts  rapping  the delivery of swift  highly rhythmic and lyrical vocals  and DJing and  or producing  the production of instrumentation either through sampling  instrumentation  turntablism or through beatboxing  the production of musical sounds through vocalized tones  122  Hip hop arose in the early 1970s in The Bronx  New York City  Jamaican immigrant DJ Kool Herc is widely regarded as the progenitor of hip hop  he brought with him from Jamaica the practice of toasting over the rhythms of popular songs  Emcees originally arose to introduce the soul  funk and R amp B songs that the DJs played  and to keep the crowd excited and dancing  over time  the DJs began isolating the percussion break of songs  when the rhythm climaxes   producing a repeated beat that the emcees rapped over  By the beginning of the 1980s  there were popular hip hop songs  and the celebrities of the scene  like LL Cool J  gained mainstream renown  Other performers experimented with politicized lyrics and social awareness  or fused hip hop with jazz  heavy metal  techno  funk and soul  New styles appeared in the latter part of the 1980s  like alternative hip hop and the closely related jazz rap fusion  pioneered by rappers like De La Soul  Gangsta rap is a kind of hip hop  most importantly characterized by a lyrical focus on macho sexuality  physicality and a dangerous criminal image  123  Though the origins of gangsta rap can be traced back to the mid 1980s style of Philadelphia s Schoolly D and the West Coast s Ice T  the style broadened and came to apply to many different regions in the country  to rappers from New York  such as Notorious B I G and influential hip hop group Wu Tang Clan  and to rappers on the West Coast  such as Too Short and N W A  A distinctive West Coast rap scene spawned the early 1990s G funk sound  which paired gangsta rap lyrics with a thick and hazy sound  often from 1970s funk samples  the best known proponents were the rappers 2Pac  Dr  Dre  Ice Cube and Snoop Dogg  Gangsta rap

music in the United States The American music industry is dominated by large companies that produce  market and distribute certain kinds of music  Generally  these companies do not produce  or produce in only very limited quantities  recordings in styles that do not appeal to very large audiences  Smaller companies often fill in the void  offering a wide variety of recordings in styles ranging from polka to salsa  Many small music industries are built around a core fanbase who may be based largely in one region  such as Tejano or Hawaiian music  or they may be widely dispersed  such as the audience for Jewish klezmer  The single largest niche industry is based on Latin music  Latin music has long influenced American popular music  and was an especially crucial part of the development of jazz  Modern pop Latin styles include a wide array of genres imported from across Latin America  including Colombian cumbia  Puerto Rican reggaeton and the Mexican corrido  Latin popular music in the United States began with a wave of dance bands in the 1930s and  50s  The most popular styles included the conga  rumba  and mambo  In the  50s Perez Prado made the cha cha cha famous  and the rise of Afro Cuban jazz opened many ears to the harmonic  melodic  and rhythmic possibilities of Latin music  The most famous American form of Latin music  however  is salsa  Salsa incorporates many styles and variations  the term can be used to describe most forms of popular Cuban derived genres  Most specifically  however  salsa refers to a particular style that was developed by mid 1970s groups of New York City area Cuban and Puerto Rican immigrants  and stylistic descendants like 1980s salsa romantica  124  Salsa rhythms are complicated  with several patterns played simultaneously  The clave rhythm forms the basis of salsa songs and is used by the performers as a common rhythmic ground for their own phrases  125  The United States played a significant role in the development of electronic dance music  specifically house and techno  which originated in Chicago and Detroit  respectively   edit  Government  politics and law The government of the United States regulates the music industry  enforces intellectual property laws and promotes and collects certain kinds of music  Under American copyright law  musical works  including recordings and compositions  are protected as intellectual property as soon as they are fixed in a tangible form  Copyright holders often register their work with the Library of Congress  which maintains a collection of the material  In addition  the Library of Congress has actively sought out culturally and musicologically significant materials since the early 20th century  such as by sending researchers to record folk music  These researchers include the pioneering American folk song collector Alan Lomax  whose work helped inspire the roots revival of the mid 20th century  The federal government also funds the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities  which allocate grants to musicians and other artists  the Smithsonian Institution  which conducts research and educational programs  and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting  which funds non profit and television broadcasters  126  Music has long affected the politics of the United States  Political parties and movements frequently use music and song to communicate their ideals and values  and to provide entertainment at political functions  The presidential campaign of William Henry Harrison was the first to greatly benefit from music  after which it became standard practice for major candidates to use songs to create public enthusiasm  In more recent decades  politicians often chose theme songs  some of which have become iconic  the song  Happy Days Are Here Again   for example  has been associated with the Democratic Party since the 1932 campaign of Franklin D  Roosevelt  Since the 1950s  however  music has declined in importance in politics  replaced by televised campaigning with little or no music  Certain forms of music became more closely associated with political protest  especially in the 1960s  Gospel stars like Mahalia Jackson became important figures in the Civil Rights Movement  while the American folk revival helped spread the counterculture of the 1960s and opposition to the Vietnam War  127   edit  Industry and economics Further information  Music industry The American music industry includes a number of fields  ranging from record companies to radio stations and community orchestras  Total industry revenue is about  40 billion worldwide  and about  12 billion in the United States  128  Most of the world s major record companies are based in the United States  they are represented by the Recording Industry Association of America  RIAA   The major record companies produce material by artists that have signed to one of their record labels  a brand name often associated with a particular genre or record producer  Record companies may also promote and market their artists  through advertising  public performances and concerts  and television appearances  Record companies may be affiliated with other music media companies  which produce a product related to popular recorded music  These include television channels like MTV  magazines like Rolling Stone and radio stations  In recent years the music industry has been embroiled in turmoil over the rise of the Internet downloading of copyrighted music  many musicians and the RIAA have sought to punish fans who illegally download copyrighted music  129  Radio stations in the United States often broadcast popular music  Each music station has a format  or a category of songs to be played  these are generally similar to but not the same as ordinary generic classification  Many radio stations in the United States are locally owned and operated  and may offer an eclectic assortment of recordings  many other stations are owned by large companies like Clear Channel  and are generally based around a smaller  more repetitive playlist  Commercial sales of recordings are tracked by Billboard magazine  which compiles a number of music charts for various fields of recorded music sales  The Billboard Hot 100 is the top pop music chart for singles  a recording consisting of a handful of songs  longer pop recordings are albums  and are tracked by the Billboard 200  130  Though recorded music is commonplace in American homes  many of the music industry s revenue comes from a small number of devotees  for example  62  of album sales come from less than 25  of the music buying audience  131  Total CD sales in the United States topped 705 million units sold in 2005  and singles sales just under three million  132  Though the major record companies dominate the American music industry  an independent music industry  indie music  does exist  Indie music is mostly based around local record labels with limited  if any  retail distribution outside a small region  Artists sometimes record for an indie label and gain enough acclaim to be signed to a major label  others choose to remain at an indie label for their entire careers  Indie music may be in styles generally similar to mainstream music  but is often inaccessible  unusual or otherwise unappealing to many people  Indie musicians often release some or all of their songs over the Internet for fans and others to download and listen  129  In addition to recording artists of many kinds  there are numerous fields of professional musicianship in the United States  many of whom rarely record  including community orchestras  wedding singers and bands  lounge singers and nightclub DJs  The American Federation of Musicians is the largest American labor union for professional musicians  However  only 15  of the Federation s members have steady music employment  133   edit  Education Further information  Music education in the United States or Music schools in the United States Music is an important part of education in the United States  and is a part of most or all school systems in the country  Music education is generally mandatory in public elementary schools  and is an elective in later years  134  High schools generally offer classes in singing  mostly choral  and instrumentation in the form of a large school band  Music may also be a part of theatrical productions put on by a school s drama department  Many public and private schools have sponsored music clubs and groups  most commonly including the marching band that performs at high school sports games  a trend that began with the wide popularity of Sousa s bands in the 1880s and 1890s  Higher education in the field of music in the United States is mostly based around large universities  though there are important small music academies and conservatories  University music departments may sponsor bands ranging from marching bands that are an important part of collegiate sporting events  prominently featuring fight songs  to barbershop groups  glee clubs  jazz ensembles and symphonies  and may additionally sponsor musical outreach programs  such as by bringing foreign performers to the area for concerts  Universities may also have a musicology department  and do research on many styles of music   edit  Scholarship The scholarly study of music in the United States includes work relating music to social class  racial  ethnic and religious identity  gender and sexuality  as well as studies of music history  musicology and other topics  The academic study of American music can be traced back to the late 19th century  when researchers like Alice Fletcher and Francis La Flesche studied the music of the Omaha peoples  working for the Bureau of American Ethnology and the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology  In the 1890s and into the early 20th century  musicological recordings were made among indigenous  Hispanic  African American and Anglo American peoples of the United States  Many worked for the Library of Congress  first under the leadership of Oscar Sonneck  chief of the Library s Music Divisions  135  These researchers included Robert W  Gordon  founder of the Archive of American Folk Song  and John and Alan Lomax  Alan Lomax was the most prominent of several folk song collectors who helped to inspire the 20th century roots revival of American folk culture  136  Early 20th scholarly analysis of American music tended to interpret European derived classical traditions as the most worthy of study  with the folk  religious and traditional musics of the common people denigrated as low class and of little artistic or social worth  American music history was compared to the much longer historical record of European nations  and was found wanting  leading writers like the composer Arthur Farwell to ponder what sorts of musical traditions might arise from American culture  in his 1915 Music in America  In 1930  John Tasker Howard s Our American Music became a standard analysis  focusing on largely on concert music composed in the United States  137  Since the analysis of musicologist Charles Seeger in the mid 20th century  American music history has often been described as intimately related to perceptions of race and ancestry  Under this view  the diverse racial and ethnic background of the United States has both promoted a sense of musical separation between the races  while still fostering constant acculturation  as elements of European  African and indigenous musics have shifted between fields  135 Gilbert Chase s America s Music  from the Pilgrims to the Present  was the first major work to examine the music of the entire United States  and recognize folk traditions as more culturally significant than music for the concert hall  Chase s analysis of a diverse American musical identity has remained the dominant view among the academic establishment  137  Until the 1960s and 70s  however  most musical scholars in the United States continued to study European music  limiting themselves only to certain fields of American music  especially European derived classical and operatic styles  and sometimes African American jazz  More modern musicologists and ethnomusicologists have studied subjects ranging from the national musical identity to the individual styles and techniques of specific communities in a particular time of American history  135  Prominent recent studies of American music include Charles Hamm s Music in the New World from 1983  and Richard Crawford s
