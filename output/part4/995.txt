Gladiator From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search For other uses  see Gladiator  disambiguation   Part of the Zliten mosaic from Libya  Leptis Magna   about 2nd century CE  It shows  left to right  a thraex fighting a murmillo  a hoplomachus standing with another murmillo  who is signaling his defeat to the referee   and one of a matched pair  A gladiator  Latin  gladiator   swordsman   from gladius   sword   was an armed combatant who entertained audiences in the Roman Republic and Roman Empire in violent confrontations with other gladiators  wild animals  and condemned criminals  Some gladiators were volunteers who risked their legal and social standing and their lives by appearing in the arena  Most were despised as slaves  schooled under harsh conditions  socially marginalized  and segregated even in death  Irrespective of their origin  gladiators offered audiences an example of Rome s martial ethics and  in fighting or dying well  they could inspire admiration and popular acclaim  They were celebrated in high and low art  and their value as entertainers was commemorated in precious and commonplace objects throughout the Roman world  The origin of gladiatorial combat is open to debate  There is evidence of it in funeral rites during the Punic Wars of the 3rd century BCE  and thereafter it rapidly became an essential feature of politics and social life in the Roman world  Its popularity led to its use in ever more lavish and costly spectacles or  gladiatorial games   The games reached their peak between the 1st century BCE and the 2nd century CE  and they finally declined during the early 5th century after the adoption of Christianity as state religion in the 390s  although  beast hunts   venationes  were continued into the 6th century  Contents 1 History of gladiatorial games 1 1 Origins 1 2 Development 1 3 Peak 1 4 Decline 1 5 Death toll 2 The Gladiators 2 1 Women as gladiators 2 2 Emperors as  gladiators  3

External links  edit  History of gladiatorial games  edit  Origins Early literary sources seldom agree on the origins of gladiators and the gladiator games  1  In the late 1st century BCE  Nicolaus of Damascus believed they were Etruscan  2  A generation later  Livy wrote that they were first held in 310 BCE by the Campanians in celebration of their victory over the Samnites  3  Long after the games had ceased  the 7th century CE writer Isidore of Seville derived Latin lanista  manager of gladiators  from the Etruscan word for  executioner   and the title of Charon  an official who accompanied the dead from the Roman gladiatorial arena  from Charun  psychopomp of the Etruscan underworld  4  Roman historians emphasized the gladiator games as a foreign import  most likely Etruscan  This preference informed most standard histories of the Roman games in the early modern era  5  Reappraisal of the evidence supports a Campanian origin  or at least a borrowing  for the games and gladiators  6  The earliest known Roman gladiator schools  ludi  were in Campania  7  Tomb frescoes from Paestum  4th century BCE  show paired fighters  with helmets  spears and shields  in a propitiatory funeral blood rite that anticipates early Roman gladiator games  8  Compared to these images  supporting evidence from Etruscan tomb paintings is tentative and late  The Paestum frescoes may represent the continuation of a much older tradition  acquired or inherited from Greek colonists of the 8th century BCE  9  Livy dates the earliest Roman gladiator games to 264 BCE  in the early stages of Rome s First Punic War against Carthage  Decimus Iunius Brutus Scaeva had three gladiator pairs fight to the death in Rome s  cattle market  Forum  Forum Boarium  to honour his dead father  Brutus Pera  This is described as a munus  plural  munera   a commemorative duty owed the manes of a dead ancestor by his descendants  10  The gladiator type used  according to a single  later source   was Thracian  11  but the development of the munus and its gladiator types was most strongly influenced by Samnium s support for Hannibal and subsequent punitive expeditions by Rome and her Campanian allies  the earliest and most frequently mentioned type was the Samnite  12  The war in Samnium  immediately afterwards  was attended with equal danger and an equally glorious conclusion  The enemy  besides their other warlike preparation  had made their battle line to glitter with new and splendid arms  There were two corps  the shields of the one were inlaid with gold  of the other with silver   The Romans had already heard of these splendid accoutrements  but their generals had taught them that a soldier should be rough to look on  not adorned with gold and silver but putting his trust in iron and in courage   The Dictator  as decreed by the senate  celebrated a triumph  in which by far the finest show was afforded by the captured armour  So the Romans made use of the splendid armour of their enemies to do honour to their gods  while the Campanians  in consequence of their pride and in hatred of the Samnites  equipped after this fashion the gladiators who furnished them entertainment at their feasts  and bestowed on them the name Samnites   Livy 9 40  13  Livy s account skirts the funereal  sacrificial function of early Roman gladiator combats and underlines the later theatrical ethos of the gladiator show  splendidly  exotically armed and armoured barbarians  treacherous and degenerate  are dominated by Roman iron and native courage  14  His plain Romans virtuously dedicate the magnificent spoils of war to the Gods  Their Campanian allies stage a dinner entertainment using gladiators who may not be Samnites  but play the Samnite role  Other groups and tribes would join the cast list as Roman territories expanded  Most gladiators were armed and armoured in the manner of the enemies of Rome  15  The munus became a morally instructive form of historic enactment in which the only honourable option for the gladiator was to fight well  or else die well  16   edit  Development In 216 BCE  Marcus Ameilius Lepidus  late consul and augur  was honoured by his sons with three days of gladiatora munera in the Forum Romanum  using twenty two pairs of gladiators  17  Ten years later  Scipio Africanus gave a commemorative munus in Iberia for his father and uncle  casualties in the Punic Wars  High status non Romans  and possibly Romans too  volunteered as his gladiators  18  The context of the Punic Wars and Rome s near disastrous defeat at the Battle of Cannae  216 BCE  link these early games to munificence  the celebration of military victory and the religious expiation of military disaster  these munera appear to serve a morale raising agenda in an era of military threat and expansion  19  The next recorded munus  held for the funeral of Publius Liciniusin in 183 BCE  was more extravagant  It involved three days of funeral games  120 gladiators  and public distribution of meat  visceratio data  20    a practice that reflected the gladiatorial fights at Campanian banquets described by Livy and later deplored by Silius Italicus  21  The enthusiastic adoption of gladiatoria munera by Rome s Iberian allies shows how easily  and how early  the culture of the gladiator munus permeated places far from Rome itself  By 174 BC   small  Roman munera  private or public   provided by an editor of relatively low importance  may have been so commonplace and unremarkable they were not considered worth recording  22  Many gladiatorial games were given in that year  some unimportant  one noteworthy beyond the rest   that of Titus Flamininus which he gave to commemorate the death of his father  which lasted four days  and was accompanied by a public distribution of meats  a banquet  and scenic performances  The climax of the show which was big for the time was that in three days seventy four gladiators fought  23  In 105 BCE  the ruling consuls offered Rome its first taste of state sponsored  barbarian combat  demonstrated by gladiators from Capua  as part of a training program for the military  It proved immensely popular  24  The ludi  state games   sponsored by the ruling elite and dedicated to a deity such as Jupiter  a divine or heroic ancestor  and later  during the Imperium  the well being and numen of the emperor   25  could now compete with privately funded munera for popular support  26   edit  Peak A retiarius stabs at a secutor with his trident in this mosaic from the villa at Nennig  Germany  c  2nd 3rd century CE  By the closing years of the politically and socially unstable Late Republic  gladiator games provided their sponsors with extravagantly expensive but effective opportunities for self promotion while offering cheap  exciting entertainment to their clients  27  Gladiators became big business for trainers and owners  for politicians on the make and those who had reached the top  A politically ambitious privatus  private citizen  might postpone his deceased father s munus to the election season  when a generous show might drum up votes  those in power and those seeking it needed the support of the plebians and their tribunes  whose votes might be won with an exceptionally spectacular show  sometimes even the mere promise of one  28 Sulla  during his term as praetor  showed his usual acumen in breaking his own sumptuary laws to give the most lavish munus yet seen in Rome  on occasion of his wife s funeral  29  Ownership of gladiators or a gladiator school gave muscle and flair to Roman politics  30  31  32  In 65 BCE  newly elected curule aedile Julius Caesar topped Sulla s display with games he justified as munus to his father  who had died twenty years before  Despite an already enormous personal debt  he used three hundred and twenty gladiator pairs in silvered armour  33  He had wanted more but the nervous Senate  mindful of the recent Spartacus revolt  fearful of Caesar s burgeoning private armies and even more fearful of his overwhelming popularity  imposed a limit of 320 pairs as the maximum number of gladiators a citizen could keep in Rome  34  Caesar s showmanship was unprecedented not only in scale and expense but in putting aside a Republican tradition of munera as funeral offerings  35  The practical differences between ludi and munera were beginning to blur  36  Gladiatorial games  usually linked with beast shows  spread throughout the Republic and beyond  37  Anti corruption laws of 65 and 63 BCE attempted but signally failed to curb their political usefulness to sponsors  38  Following Caesar s assassination and the Roman Civil War  Augustus assumed Imperial authority over the games  including munera  and formalised their provision as a civic and religious duty  39  His revision of sumptuary law capped private and public expenditure on munera  claiming to save the Roman elite from the bankruptcies they would otherwise suffer  and restricted their performance to the festivals of Saturnalia and Quinquatria  40  Henceforth  the ceiling cost for a praetor s  economical  but official munus of a maximum 120 gladiators was to be 25 000 denarii   500 000    Generous  Imperial ludi might cost no less than 180 000 denarii   3 6 million   41  42  Throughout the Empire  the greatest and most celebrated games would now be identified with the state sponsored Imperial cult  which furthered public recognition  respect and approval for the Emperor  his law  and his agents  43  Between 108 and 109 CE  Trajan celebrated his Dacian victories using a reported 10 000 gladiators  and 11 000 animals  over 123 days  44  The cost of gladiators and munera continued to spiral out of control  Legislation of 177 CE by Marcus Aurelius  which did little to stop it  was completely ignored by his son  Commodus  45   edit  Decline The decline of the munus was a far from straightforward process  46  As the crisis of the 3rd century imposed increasing military demands on the imperial purse  from which the Roman Empire never quite recovered  lesser magistrates found the obligatory munera an increasingly unrewarding tax on the doubtful privileges of office  Still  emperors continued to subsidize their performance as a matter of undiminished public interest  47  In the early 3rd century  the Christian writer Tertullian had acknowledged their power over the Christian flock  and was compelled to be blunt  the combats were murder  their witnessing spiritually and morally harmful and the gladiator an instrument of pagan human sacrifice  48  In the next century  Augustine deplored the youthful fascination of his friend  and later fellow convert and Bishop  Alypius  with the munera spectacle as inimical to a Christian life and salvation  49  Amphitheatres continued to host the spectacular administration of Imperial justice  in 315 Constantine I condemned child snatchers ad bestias in the arena  Ten years later  he banned the gladiator munera  In times in which peace and peace relating to domestic affairs prevail bloody demonstrations displease us  Therefore  we order that there may be no more gladiator combats  Those who were condemned to become gladiators for their crimes are to work from now on in the mines  Thus they pay for their crimes without having to pour their blood  50  A 5th century mosaic in the Great Palace of Constantinople depicts two venatores fighting a tiger  An imperially sanctioned munus at some time in the 330s suggests that yet again  imperial legislation was ineffective  not least when Constantine defied his own law  51  In 365  Valentinian I  r  364 375  threatened to fine a judge who sentenced Christians to the arena and in 384  attempted to limit the expenses of munera  52  53  54  In 393  Theodosius  r  379 395  adopted Christianity as the Roman state religion and banned pagan festivals  55  The ludi continued  very gradually shorn of their stubbornly pagan munera  Honorius  r  395 423  legally ended munera in 399  and again in 404  at least in the Western half of the Empire according to Theodoret  because of the martyrdom of Saint Telemachus by spectators at a munus  56 Valentinian III  r  425 455  repeated the ban in 438  perhaps effectively  though venationes continued beyond 536  57  By this time  munera had already been replaced in the popular favour by theatrical shows  and the chariot races which  at least in the Eastern Empire  continued to attract generous Imperial subsidy  It is not known how many gladiatoria munera were given throughout the Roman period  Many  if not most  involved venationes  and in the later Empire some may have been only that  One primary source  the Calendar of Furius Dionysius Philocalus for 354  survives to suggest how the gladiator featured among a multitude of festivals in the Late Empire period  In that year  176 days were reserved for spectacles of various kinds  Of these  102 days were for theatrical shows  64 for chariot races and just 10 in December for gladiator games and venationes  58  Thomas Wiedemann interprets this in the much earlier context of the Historia Augusta  in which Alexander Severus  r  222 235  was said to intend the redistribution of munera throughout the year  This would have broken with the traditional positioning of the major gladiator games at the year s end  as Wiedemann points out  December was the month for Saturnalia  the festival in which the lowest became the highest  and in which death was linked to renewal   edit  Death toll Historians Keith Hopkins and Mary Beard tentatively estimate a total of 400 arenas throughout the Roman Empire at its greatest extent  with a combined total of 8 000 deaths per annum from all causes  including execution  combat and accident  59   edit  The Gladiators Main article  List of Roman gladiator types The trade in gladiators was Empire wide  and subjected to official supervision  Rome s military success produced an influx of soldier prisoners who were redistributed for use in State mines or amphitheatres and for sale on the open market  For example  in the aftermath of the Jewish Revolt  the gladiator schools received an influx of Jews   those rejected for training would have been sent straight to the arenas as noxii  lit   hurtful ones    60  The best   the most robust   were sent to Rome  The granting of slave status to soldiers who had surrendered or allowed their own capture was regarded as an unmerited gift of life and gladiator training was an opportunity for them to regain their honour in the munus  61  Pollice Verso   With a Turned Thumb    an 1872 painting by Jean L on G r me  is a well known historical painter s researched conception of a gladiatorial combat  Two other sources of gladiators  found increasingly during the Principate and the Pax Romana  were slaves condemned to the arena  to gladiator schools or games  ad ludum gladiatorium  62  as punishment for crimes  and paid volunteers  auctorati  who by the late Republic may have comprised approximately half   and possibly the most capable half   of all gladiators  63  The use of volunteers had a precedent in the Iberian munus of Scipio Africanus  but none of those had been paid  18  For Romans   gladiator  would have meant a schooled fighter  sworn and contracted to a master  For those who were poor or non citizens  the gladiator schools offered a trade  regular food  housing of sorts and a fighting chance of fame and fortune  Gladiators customarily kept their prize money and any gifts they received  Tiberius offered several retired gladiators 100 000 sesterces   500 000  each to return to the arena  64 Nero gave the gladiator Spiculus property and residence  equal to those of men who had celebrated triumphs    65 Mark Antony promoted gladiators to his personal guard  66   edit  Women as gladiators From the 60s CE female gladiators appear  as  exotic markers of exceptionally lavish spectacle   67  In 66 CE  Nero had Ethiopian women  men and children fight at a munus to impress King Tiridates I of Armenia  68  Romans seem to have found the idea of a female gladiator novel and entertaining  or downright absurd  Juvenal titillates his readers with a woman named  Mevia   hunting boars in the arena  with spear in hand and breasts exposed   69  and Petronius mocks the pretensions of a rich  low class citizen  whose munus includes a woman fighting from a cart or chariot  70  A munus of 89 CE  during Domitian s reign  featured a battle between female gladiators and dwarfs  71  In Halicarnassus  a 2nd century CE relief depicts two female combatants named  Amazon  and  Achillia   their match ended in a draw  72  In the same century  an epigraph praises one of Ostia s local elite as the first to  arm women  in the history of its games  72  Female gladiators probably submitted to the same regulations and training as their male counterparts  73  Roman morality required that all gladiators be of the lowest social classes  and emperors who failed to respect this distinction earned the scorn of posterity  Cassius Dio takes pains to point out that when the much admired emperor Titus used female gladiators  they were of acceptably low class  67  Some regarded female gladiators as a symptom of corrupted Roman sensibilities  morals and womanhood  regardless of class  Before he became emperor  Septimius Severus may have attended the Antiochene Olympic Games  which had been revived by the emperor Commodus and included traditional Greek female athletics  His attempt to give Rome a similarly dignified display of female athletics was met by the crowd with ribald chants and cat calls  74  Probably as a result  he banned the use of female gladiators in 200 CE  75  76   edit  Emperors as  gladiators  Caligula  Titus  Hadrian  Lucius Verus  Caracalla  Geta and Didius Julianus were all said to have performed in the arena  either in public or private  but risks to themselves were minimal  77  Claudius  characterised by his historians as morbidly cruel and boorish  fought a whale trapped in the harbor in front of a group of spectators  78  Commentators invariably disapproved of such performances  79  Commodus was a fanatical participant at the ludi  much to the shame of the Senate  whom he loathed  and the probable delight of the populace at large  He fought as a secutor  styling himself  Hercules Reborn   As a bestiarius  he was said to have killed 100 lions in one day  almost certainly from a platform set up around the arena perimeter which allowed him to safely demonstrate his marksmanship  On another occasion  he decapitated a running ostrich with a specially designed dart  carried the bloodied head and his sword over to the Senatorial seats and gesticulated as though they were next  80  He was said to have restyled Nero s colossal statue in his own image as  Hercules Reborn  and re dedicated it to himself with the inscription   Champion of secutores  only left handed fighter to conquer twelve times one thousand men   For this  he drew a gigantic stipend from the public purse  81  Perhaps to explain both his obsession and administrative incompetence  gossips suggested that his mother  Faustina the Younger  had conceived him with a gladiator  82   edit  Outline of the games The earliest munera took place at or near the tomb of the deceased and these were organised by their munerator  who made the offering   Later games were held by an editor  either identical with the munerator or an official employed by him  As time passed  these titles and meanings may have merged  83  In the Republican era  private citizens could own and train gladiators  or lease them from a lanista  owner of a gladiator training school   From the Principate onwards  private citizens could hold munera and own gladiators only under Imperial permission  and the role of editor was increasingly tied to state officialdom  Legislation by Claudius required that quaestors  the lowest rank of Roman magistrate  personally subsidise two thirds of the costs of games for their small town communities   in effect  both an advertisement of their personal generosity and a part purchase of their office  Bigger games were put on by senior magistrates  who could better afford them  The largest and most lavish of all were paid for by the emperor himself  84  85  An outline of these later games can be conjectured  using written histories  contemporary accounts  statuary  ephemera  memorabilia and stylised pictographic evidence  86  Almost all the evidence comes from the Late Republic and Empire  and much of it from Pompeii  84  87  This mosaic depicts some of the entertainments that would have been offered at the games  Games were advertised beforehand on conspicuously placed billboards  giving the reason for the game  its editor  venue  date and the number of paired gladiators  ordinarii  to be used  Other highlighted features could include details of venationes  executions  music and any luxuries to be provided for the spectators  including a decorated awning against the sun  and water sprinklers  Food  drink  sweets and occasionally  door prizes  could be offered  For enthusiasts  a more detailed program  libellus  was prepared for the day of the munus  showing the names  types and match records of gladiator pairs  of interest to gamblers  and their order of appearance  Copies of the libellus were distributed among the crowd on the day of the match  88  Left handed gladiators were advertised as an interesting rarity  they were trained to fight right handers  which gave them advantage over most opponents and produced an interestingly unorthodox combination  89  The night before the munus  the gladiators were given a banquet and opportunity to order their personal and private affairs  Futrell notes its similarity to a ritualistic  last meal   90  These were probably both family and public events which included even the noxii and damnati and they may have been used to drum up more publicity for the coming match  91  92  From Augustus s time  official munera seem to have followed a standard sequence  93  A procession  pompa  entered the arena led by lictors bearing fasces that signified the magistrate editor s power over life and death  They were followed by a small band of tubicines playing a fanfare  Images of the gods were carried in to  witness  the proceedings  followed by a scribe  to record the outcome  and a man carrying the palm branch used to honour victors  The magistrate editor entered among a retinue who carried the arms and armour to be used  more musicians followed  then horses  The gladiators presumably came in last  94  These official games usually began with venationes  beast hunts  and bestiarii  beast fighting  gladiators  Sometimes beasts were unharmed and simply exhibited  95  Next came the ludi meridiani  of variable content but usually involving executions of noxii  sometimes as  mythological  re enactments  or others condemned  damnati  to the arena  96  Gladiators may have been involved in these though the crowd  and the gladiators themselves  preferred the  dignity  of an even contest  97  There were also comedy fights  some may have been lethal  A crude Pompeian graffito suggests a burlesque of musicians  dressed as animals named Ursus tibicen  flute playing bear  and Pullus cornicen  horn blowing chicken   perhaps as accompaniment to clowning by paegniarii during a  mock  contest of the ludi meridiani  98  Before the listed contests were fought  the gladiators may have held informal warm up matches  using blunted or dummy weapons   some munera  however  may have used blunted weapons throughout  99  The editor  his representative or an honoured guest would check the weapons  probatio armorum  for the scheduled matches  100  These were the highlight of the day  and were as inventive  varied and novel as the editor could afford  Armatures could be very costly   some were flamboyantly decorated with exotic feathers  jewels and precious metals  Increasingly the munus was the editor s gift to spectators who had come to expect the best as their due  101  In late Republican munera  between 10 and 13 pairs could have fought on one day  this assumes one match at a time in the course of an afternoon  91  Fights were interspersed or accompanied by music  the Zliten mosaic in Libya  circa 80 100 CE  shows musicians playing an accompaniment to provincial games  with gladiators  bestiarii  or venatores and prisoners attacked by beasts   Their instruments are a long straight trumpet  tubicen   a large curved horn  Cornu  and a water organ  hydraulis   102  Similar representations  musicians  gladiators and bestiari  are found on a tomb relief in Pompeii  103   edit  Combat Mosaic at the National Archaeological Museum in Madrid showing a retiarius named Kalendio  shown surrendering in the upper section  fighting a secutor named Astyanax  The   sign by Kalendio s name implies he was killed after surrendering  In the earliest munera  death was considered the proper outcome of combat  During the Imperial era  matches were sometimes advertised sine missione  without release  from the sentence of death    which suggests that missio  the sparing of a defeated gladiator s life  had become a common practice at the games  The contract between editor and lanista could include compensation for unexpected deaths  104  105  As the demand for gladiators began to exceed supply  matches sine missione were officially banned  a pragmatic Augustan decision that also happened to reflect popular demands for  natural justice   Refusals by Caligula and Claudius to spare popular but defeated fighters did nothing to boost their own popularity  In most circumstances  a gladiator who fought well was likely to be spared  106  By common custom  the spectators decided whether or not a losing gladiator should be spared  and chose the winner in the rare event of a  standing tie   107  108  Most matches employed a senior referee  summa rudis  and an assistant  shown in mosaics with long staffs  rudes  to caution or separate opponents at some crucial point in the match  A gladiator s self acknowledged defeat  signaled by a raised finger  ad digitum   told the referee to stop the combat and refer to the editor  whose decision would usually rest on the crowd s mood  During the match  referees exercised judgement and discretion  they could stop bouts entirely  or pause them to allow combatants rest  refreshment and a  rub down   109  Most gladiators fought at two or three munera annually  An unknown number died in their first match and a few fought in up to 150 combats  110  At a Pompeian match between chariot fighters  Publius Orosius  with previous 51 wins to his credit  was granted missio after losing to Scylax  with 26 victories  111  A single bout probably lasted between 10 15 minutes  or 20 minutes at most  112  Spectators preferred well matched ordinarii with complementary fighting styles but other combinations are found  such as several gladiators fighting together or the serial replacement of a match loser by a new gladiator  who would fight the winner  113  Victors received the palm branch and an award from the editor  An outstanding fighter might receive a laurel crown and money from an appreciative crowd but for anyone originally condemned ad ludum the greatest reward was manumission  i e   emancipation   symbolised by the gift of a wooden training sword or staff  rudis  from the editor  Martial describes a match between Priscus and Verus  who fought so evenly and bravely for so long that when both acknowledged defeat at the same instant  Titus awarded victory and a rudis to each  114  Flamma was awarded the rudis four times  but chose to remain a gladiator  His gravestone in Sicily includes his record   Flamma  secutor  lived 30 years  fought 34 times  won 21 times  fought to a draw 9 times  defeated 4 times  a Syrian by nationality  Delicatus made this for his deserving comrade in arms   115   edit  Factions and rivals The Amphitheatre at Pompeii  depicting the riot between the Nucerians and the Pompeians  Popular factions supported favourite gladiators and gladiator types  116  Under Augustan legislation  the Samnite type was renamed secutor  equipped with an oblong or  large  shield   whose supporters were secutarii  117  As the games evolved  any lightly armed  defensive fighter could be included in this group  The heavily armoured and armed Thracian types  Thraex  and Murmillo  who fought with smaller shields  were parmularii  small shield   as were their supporters  Trajan preferred the parmularii and Domitian the secutarii  Marcus Aurelius took neither side  Nero seems to have enjoyed the brawls between rowdy  enthusiastic and sometimes violent factions  but called in the troops if they went too far  118  119  Once a band of five retiarii in tunics  matched against the same number of secutores  yielded without a struggle  but when their death was ordered  one of them caught up his trident and slew all the victors  Caligula bewailed this in a public proclamation as a most cruel murder  120  There were also local rivalries  At Pompeii s amphitheatre  trading of insults between Pompeians and Nucerian spectators during public ludi led to stone throwing and riot  Many were killed or wounded  Nero banned gladiator munera  though not the games  at Pompeii for ten years as punishment  The story is told in graffiti and high quality wall painting  with much boasting of Pompeii s  victory  over Nuceria  121   edit  Schools and training The earliest named gladiator school  singular  ludus  plural  ludi  is that of Aurelius Scaurus at Capua   he was lanista of the gladiators employed by the state circa 105 BCE to instruct the legions and simultaneously entertain the public  122  Few other lanistae are known by name  they were head of their familia gladiatoria  with legal power over life and death of every family member  including servi poenae  auctorati and ancillaries but socially they were infames  on a footing with pimps and butchers and despised as price gougers  123  No such stigma was attached to a gladiator owner  munerarius or editor  of good family  high status and independent means  124 Cicero congratulated his friend Atticus on buying a splendid troop   if he rented them out  he might recover their entire cost after two performances  125  Following the Spartacus revolt and the political exploitation of munera  legislation progressively restricted the ownership  siting and organisation of the schools  By Domitian s time  many had been more or less absorbed by the State  including those at Pergamum  Alexandria  Praeneste and Capua  126  The city of Rome itself had four  the Ludus Magnus  the largest and most important  housing up to about 2 000 gladiators   Ludus Dacicus  Ludus Gallicus  and the Ludus Matutinus  which trained bestiarii  83  Volunteers required a magistrate s permission to join a school as auctorati  127  If this was granted  the school s physician assessed their suitability  Their contract  auctoramentum  stipulated how often they were to perform  their fighting style and earnings  A condemned bankrupt or debtor accepted as novicius could negotiate for partial or complete debt payment by his lanista or editor  Faced with runaway re enlistment fees for skilled auctorati  Marcus Aurelius set their upper limit at 12 000 sesterces   60 000   128  All prospective gladiators  whether volunteer or condemned  swore the same oath  sacramentum   129  Novices  novicii  trained under teachers of particular fighting styles  probably retired gladiators  130  They could ascend through a hierarchy of grades  singular  palus  in which primus palus was the highest  131  Lethal weapons were prohibited in the schools   weighted  blunt wooden versions were probably used  Fighting styles were probably learned through constant rehearsal as choreographed  numbers   An elegant  economical style was preferred  Training included preparation for a stoical  unflinching death  Successful training required intense commitment  132  Those condemned ad ludum were probably branded or marked with a tattoo  stigma  plural stigmata  on the face  legs and or hands  These stigmata may have been text   fugitive slaves were marked thus on the forehead until Constantine banned the use of facial stigmata in 325 CE  Soldiers were marked on the hand  133  Gladiators were accommodated in cells typically arranged in barrack formation around a central practice arena  Juvenal describes the segregation of gladiators according to type and status  suggestive of rigid hierarchies within the schools   even the lowest scum of the arena observe this rule  even in prison they re separate   Retiarii were kept away from damnati  and  fag targeteers  from  armoured heavies   As most ordinarii at games were from the same school  this kept potential opponents separate and safe from each other until the lawful munus  134  Discipline could be extreme  even lethal  135  Remains of a Pompeian ludus site attest to developments in supply  demand and discipline  in its earliest phase  the building could accommodate 15 20 gladiators  Its replacement could have housed about 100 and included a very small cell  probably for lesser punishments and so low that standing was impossible  136   edit  Diet and medical care Despite the harsh discipline  gladiators represented a substantial investment for their lanista and were otherwise well cared for  Their high energy  vegetarian diet combined barley  boiled beans  oatmeal  ash  believed to help fortify the body  and dried fruit  Compared to modern athletes  they were probably overweight  but this may have  protected their vital organs from the cutting blows of their opponents   The same research suggests they may have fought barefoot  137  138  Regular massage and high quality medical care helped mitigate an otherwise very severe training regime  Part of Galen s medical training was at a gladiator school in Pergamum where he saw  and would later criticise  the training  diet  and long term health prospects of the gladiators  139   edit  Legal and social status  He vows to endure to be burned  to be bound  to be beaten  and to be killed by the sword   The gladiator s oath as cited by Petronius  Satyricon  117   The legal status of gladiators was unequivocal  they were slaves  and only slaves found guilty of specific offences could be sentenced to the arena  Citizens were legally exempt from this sentence but those found guilty of particular offenses could be stripped of citizenship  formally enslaved and dealt with accordingly  Freedmen or freedwomen offenders could be legally reverted to slavery  140  Arena punishment could be meted for banditry  theft and arson  or treasonous acts such as rebellion  census evasion to avoid paying due taxes and refusal to swear lawful oaths  141  Offenders seen as obnoxious to the state  noxii  received the most humiliating punishments  142  By the 1st century BCE  noxii were being condemned to the beasts  damnati ad bestias  in the arena  with almost no chance of survival  or were made to kill each other  143  From the early Imperial era  some were forced to participate in humiliating and novel forms of mythological or historical enactment  culminating in their execution  144  Painting of fighting gladiator  Spain  Those judged less harshly might be condemned ad ludum venatorium or ad gladiatorium   combat with animals or gladiators  in which they were armed as thought appropriate  These damnati at least might put on a good show and retrieve some respect  They might even   and occasionally did   survive to fight another day  Some may even have become  proper  gladiators  145  Modern customs and institutions offer few useful parallels to the legal and social context which defined the gladiatoria munera 146  Under law  anyone condemned to the arena or the gladiator schools  ad ludum  was a servus poenae under sentence of death unless manumitted  147  A rescript of Hadrian reminded magistrates that  those sentenced to the sword  should be despatched immediately  or at least within the year   Those sentenced to the ludi should not be discharged before five years or three years if awarded manumission  148  The phenomenon of the  volunteer  gladiator is more problematic  All contracted volunteers  including those of equestrian and senatorial class  were legally enslaved by their auctoratio because it involved their potentially lethal submission to a master  149  Nor does the citizen or free volunteer s  professional  status translate into modern terms  All arenarii  those who appeared in the arena  were  infames by reputation   a form of social dishonour which excluded them from most of the advantages and rights of citizenship  Payment for such appearances compounded their infamia  150  The legal and social status of even the most popular and wealthy auctorati was thus marginal at best  They could not vote  plead in court nor leave a will  unless they were manumitted  their lives and property belonged to their masters  151  Nevertheless  there is evidence of informal if not entirely lawful practices to the contrary  Some  unfree  gladiators bequeathed money and personal property to wives and children  possibly via a sympathetic owner or familia  some had their own slaves and gave them their freedom  152  One gladiator was even granted  citizenship  to several Greek cities of the Eastern Roman world  153  Among the most admired and skilled auctorati were those who returned to the arena having been granted manumission  154  Some of these highly trained and experienced specialists may have had no other practical choice open to them  Under Roman law  a former gladiator could not  offer such services  as those of a gladiator  after manumission  because they cannot be performed without endangering  his  life   155  Caesar s munus of 46 BCE included at least one equestrian  son of a Praetor  and possibly two senatorial volunteers  156  Under Augustus  senators and equestrians and their descendants were formally excluded from the infamia of association with the arena and its personnel  arenarii   However  some magistrates   and some later Emperors   tacitly or openly condoned such transgressions and some volunteers were prepared to embrace the resulting loss of status  Some did so for payment  some for military glory and  in one recorded case  for personal honour  157  In 11 CE  Augustus  who enjoyed the games  bent his own rules and allowed equestrians to volunteer because  the prohibition was no use   158  Under Tiberius  the Larinum decree 159   19 CE  reiterated the laws which Augustus himself had waived  Thereafter  Caligula flouted them and Claudius strengthened them  Nero and Commodus ignored them  Valentinian II  some hundreds of years later  protested against the same infractions and repeated similar laws  his was an officially Christian empire  160  One very notable social renegade was an aristocratic descendant of the Gracchi  infamous for his marriage  as a bride  to a male horn player  He made a voluntary and  shameless  arena appearance not only as a lowly retiarius tunicatus but in woman s attire and a conical hat adorned with gold ribbon  In Juvenal s account  he seems to have relished the scandalous self display  applause and the disgrace he inflicted on his more sturdy opponent by repeatedly skipping away from the confrontation  161   edit  Amphitheatres Main article  List of Roman amphitheatres Most spectators would have witnessed gladiator fights in the arenas or amphitheatres built throughout the Republic and later  the Empire  162  The Colosseum in Rome  Italy  A photograph of the best known Roman era amphitheatre taken in the early evening  Gladiatorial combats were the main event and usually held around this time of day  Early munera were probably private affairs  and offered limited visibility for non privileged spectators  As these events became larger  open spaces such as the Forum Romanum were adapted  as the Forum Boarium had been  as venues in Rome and elsewhere  with temporary  elevated seating for the patron and high status spectators  These were not truly public events  A show of gladiators was to be exhibited before the people in the market place  and most of the magistrates erected scaffolds round about  with an intention of letting them for advantage  Caius commanded them to take down their scaffolds  that the poor people might see the sport without paying anything  But nobody obeying these orders of his  he gathered together a body of labourers  who worked for him  and overthrew all the scaffolds the very night before the contest was to take place  So that by the next morning the market place was cleared  and the common people had an opportunity of seeing the pastime  In this  the populace thought he had acted the part of a man  but he much disobliged the tribunes his colleagues  who regarded it as a piece of violent and presumptuous interference  163  Towards the end of the Republic  Cicero  Murena  72 3  still describes these shows as ticketed   their usefulness was served by inviting the rural tribunes of the plebs  not the people of Rome en masse   but in Imperial times  poor citizens in receipt of the corn dole were allocated free seating  possibly by lottery  164  Others had to pay  Ticket scalpers  Locarii  sometimes sold or let out seats at inflated prices  Martial wrote that  Hermes  a gladiator who always drew the crowds  means riches for the ticket scalpers   165  The standard amphitheatre layout made the execution of justice visible to all classes  It elevated  separated and distanced the Roman community from the place where judgment was meted out  It was a theatre  with the arena as stage  a place of entertainment and containment  its actors polluted by their association with ignominy and death  From across the stands  crowd and editor could assess each others character and temperament  and freely express their mutual pleasure or displeasure not only at the spectacle below but at each other  For the crowd  the amphitheatre afforded unique opportunities for free expression and free speech  theatralis licentia   Petitions could be submitted to the editor  as magistrate  in full view of the community  Factiones and claques could vent their spleen on each other  and occasionally on Emperors  The emperor Titus s dignified yet confident ease in his management of an amphitheatre crowd and its factions were taken as a measure of his enormous popularity and the rightness of his imperium  The amphitheatre munus thus served the Roman community as living theatre and a court in miniature  in which judgement was also served on the judges  166  167  168  Yet  permanent amphitheatres appeared long after the munera had become an established part of Roman life  The blocking of earlier provision for permanent venues  and particularly of permanent seating  reflected genuine unease  not simply at political graft but at the erosion of public morals that must arise from frequent and excessively  luxurious  munera  169  Pompeii s first amphitheatre was built by Sullan colonists around 70 BCE  170  The first in the city of Rome was the extraordinary wooden Amphitheatre of Gaius Scribonius Curio  built in 53 BCE   171  The first part stone amphitheatre in Rome was inaugurated in 29 30 BCE  in time for the triple triumph of Octavian  later Augustus   172  Shortly after it burned down in 64 CE  Vespasian began its replacement  later known as the Amphitheatrum Flavium  Colosseum   which seated 50 000 spectators and would remain the largest in the Empire  It was inaugurated by Titus in 80 CE  the personal gift of the Emperor to the people of Rome  paid for by the Imperial share of booty after the Jewish Revolt  173  Roman arena at Arles  inside view  Amphitheatres also provided a potential model for social control  Seating was  disorderly and indiscriminate  until Augustus prescribed its arrangement in his Social Reforms  To persuade the Senate  he expressed his distress on behalf of a Senator who could not find seating at a crowded games in Puteoli  In consequence of this the senate decreed that  whenever any public show was given anywhere  the first row of seats should be reserved for senators  and at Rome he would not allow the envoys of the free and allied nations to sit in the orchestra  since he was informed that even freedmen were sometimes appointed  He separated the soldiery from the people  He assigned special seats to the married men of the commons  to boys under age their own section and the adjoining one to their preceptors  and he decreed that no one wearing a dark cloak should sit in the middle of the house  He would not allow women to view even the gladiators except from the upper seats  though it had been the custom for men and women to sit together at such shows  Only the Vestal virgins were assigned a place to themselves  opposite the praetor s tribunal  174  These arrangements do not seem to have been strongly enforced  118   edit  Death  disposal  and remembrance A flask depicting the final phase of the fight between a murmillo  winning  and a thraex  The proximity of death defined the munus for all concerned  To die well  a gladiator should never ask for mercy  nor cry out  175  A  good death  redeemed a defeated gladiator from the dishonourable weakness and passivity of defeat  and provided a noble example to those who watched  176  For death  when it stands near us  gives even to inexperienced men the courage not to seek to avoid the inevitable  So the gladiator  no matter how faint hearted he has been throughout the fight  offers his throat to his opponent and directs the wavering blade to the vital spot   Seneca  Epistles  30 8  Some mosaics show defeated gladiators kneeling in preparation for the moment of death  Seneca s  vital spot  seems to have meant the neck  177  Gladiator remains from Ephesus confirm this  178  The body of a gladiator who had died well was placed on a couch of Libitina and removed from the arena with dignity  Once in the arena morgue  the corpse would have been stripped of armour  and probably had its throat cut to prove that dead was dead  The Christian author Tertullian  commenting on ludi meridiani in Roman Carthage during the peak era of the games  describes a more humiliating method of removal  One arena official  dressed as the  brother of Jove   Dis Pater  god of the underworld  strikes the corpse with a mallet  Another  dressed as Mercury  tests for life signs with a heated  wand   once confirmed as dead  the body is dragged from the arena  179  Whether these victims were gladiators or noxii is unknown  Modern pathological examination confirms the probably fatal use of a mallet on some  but not all the gladiator skulls found in a gladiators  cemetery  180  Kyle  1998  proposes that gladiators who disgraced themselves might have been subjected to the same indignities as noxii  denied the relative mercies of a quick death and dragged from the arena as carrion  181  Whether the corpse of such a gladiator could be redeemed from further ignominy by friends or familia is not known  182  Few gladiators survived more than 10 matches or lived past the age of 30  One  Felix  is known to have lived to 45 and one retired gladiator lived to 90  George Ville calculated an average age at death at 27 for gladiators  based on headstone evidence   with mortality  among all who entered the arena  around the 1st century CE at 19 100  A rise in the risk of death for losers  from 1 5 to 1 4 between the early and later Imperial periods  seems to suggest missio was granted less often  183  Marcus Junkelmann disputes Ville s calculation for average age at death  the majority would have received no headstone  and would have died early in their careers  at 18 25 years of age  184  Death and disposal therefore perpetuated the divisions and judgements of society  In the pre Christian era  the highest status funerals involved expensive  prolonged cremation ceremonies  sometimes complete with a munus offering  At the opposite extreme  the noxii  and possibly other damnati  could be thrown into rivers or dumped unburied  185  This extended their damnatio beyond death into perpetual oblivion and their shade  manes  to restless wandering upon the earth as dreadful larvae or lemures  186  All others   citizens  slaves or free   were usually buried beyond the town or city limits to avoid the ritual and physical pollution of their community  Gladiators were segregated in separate cemeteries  Even for those whose death had brought honourable release  the taint of infamia was perpetual  187  Memorials were a major expense  and testify only to those who prospered  Gladiators could subscribe to a union  collegia  which ensured proper burial  with compensation for wives and children  The gladiator s familia or one of its members  including lanistae  comrades  wives and children  sometimes paid  188  Tomb inscriptions from the Eastern Roman Empire include these brief examples   The familia set this up in memory of Saturnilos    For Nikepharos  son of Synetos  Lakedaimonian  and for Narcissus the secutor  Titus Flavius Satyrus set up this monument in his memory from his own money    For Hermes  Paitraeites with his cell mates set this up in memory   189  The hand of Nemesis absolved a gladiator from the ignominy of defeat  and his memorial maintained his virtus in perpetuity as a skilled fighter  worth avenging   I  Victor  left handed  lie here  but my homeland was in Thessalonica  Doom killed me  not the liar Pinnas  No longer let him boast  I had a fellow gladiator  Polyneikes  who killed Pinnas and avenged me  Claudius Thallus set up this memorial from what I left behind as a legacy   190   edit  Gladiators in Roman life  edit  Gladiators and the military A man who knows how to conquer in war is a man who knows how to arrange a banquet and put on a show  191  Rome was essentially a landowning military aristocracy  From the early days of the Republic  ten years of military service were a citizen s duty and a prerequisite for election to public office  Devotio  willingness to sacrifice one s life to the greater good  was central to the Roman military ideal  and was the core of the Roman military oath  It applied from highest to lowest alike in the chain of command  192  As a soldier committing his life  voluntarily  at least in theory  to the greater cause of Rome s victory  he was not expected to survive defeat  193  The Punic Wars of the late 3rd century BCE   in particular the near catastrophic defeat of Roman arms at Cannae   had long lasting effects on the Republic  its citizen armies  and the development of the gladiatorial munera  In the aftermath of Cannae  Scipio Africanus crucified Roman deserters and had non Roman deserters thrown to the beasts  194  The Senate refused to ransom Hannibal s Roman captives  instead  they made drastic preparations  In obedience to the Books of Destiny  some strange and unusual sacrifices were made  human sacrifices amongst them  A Gaulish man and a Gaulish woman and a Greek man and a Greek woman were buried alive under the Forum Boarium   They were lowered into a stone vault  which had on a previous occasion also been polluted by human victims  a practice most repulsive to Roman feelings  When the gods were believed to be duly propitiated   Armour  weapons  and other things of the kind were ordered to be in readiness  and the ancient spoils gathered from the enemy were taken down from the temples and colonnades  The dearth of freemen necessitated a new kind of enlistment  8 000 sturdy youths from amongst the slaves were armed at the public cost  after they had each been asked whether they were willing to serve or no  These soldiers were preferred  as there would be an opportunity of ransoming them when taken prisoners at a lower price  195  Mosaic depicting a gladiators fight  The House of the Gladiators  Kourion  Cyprus  The account notes  uncomfortably  the proximity of recent human sacrifice  While the Senate mustered their willing slaves  Hannibal offered his dishonoured Roman captives a chance for honourable death  in what Livy describes as something very like the Roman munus  The munus thus represented an essentially military  self sacrificial ideal  taken to extreme fulfillment in the gladiator s oath  168  By the devotio of a voluntary oath  a slave might achieve the quality of a Roman  Romanitas   become the embodiment of true virtus  manliness  or manly virtue   and paradoxically  be granted missio while remaining a slave  129  The gladiator as a specialist fighter  and the ethos and organization of the gladiator schools  would inform the development of the Roman military as the most effective force of its time  196  In 107 BCE  the Marian Reforms established the Roman army as a professional body  Two years later  following its defeat at Arausio     weapons training was given to soldiers by P  Rutilius  consul with C  Mallis  For he  following the example of no previous general  with teachers summoned from the gladiatorial training school of C  Aurelus Scaurus  implanted in the legions a more sophisticated method of avoiding and dealing a blow and mixed bravery with skill and skill back again with virtue so that skill became stronger by bravery s passion and passion became more wary with the knowledge of this art  24  The military were great aficionados of the games  and supervised the schools  Many schools and amphitheatres were sited at or near military barracks  and some provincial army units owned gladiator troupes  197  As the Republic wore on  the term of military service increased from ten to the sixteen years formalised by Augustus in the Principate  It would rise to twenty  and later  to twenty five years  Roman military discipline was ferocious  severe enough to provoke mutiny  despite the consequences  A career as a volunteer gladiator may have seemed an attractive option for some  198  In the Year of the Four Emperors  Otho s troops at Bedriacum included 2000 gladiators  Opposite him on the field  Vitellius s army was swollen by levies of slaves  plebs and gladiators  199  In 167 CE  troop depletions by plague and desertion may have prompted Marcus Aurelius to draft gladiators at his own expense  Gladiators do not seem to have made good field soldiers   their enrollment should be seen as an act of desperation  200  During the Civil Wars that led to the Principate  Octavian  later Augustus  acquired the personal gladiator troop of his erstwhile opponent  Mark Antony  They had served their late master with exemplary loyalty but were quietly disposed of  They were  after all  infames  66   edit  Religion  ethics and sentiment Roman writing as a whole demonstrates a deep ambivalence towards the gladiatoria munera  Even the most complex and sophisticated munera of the Imperial era evoked the ancient  ancestral dii manes of the underworld and were framed by the protective  lawful rites of sacrificium  Their popularity made their co option by the state inevitable  Cicero acknowledged their sponsorship as a political imperative  201  Despite the popular adulation of gladiators  they were set apart  despised  and despite Cicero s contempt for the mob  he shared their admiration   Even when  gladiators  have been felled  let alone when they are standing and fighting  they never disgrace themselves  And suppose a gladiator has been brought to the ground  when do you ever see one twist his neck away after he has been ordered to extend it for the death blow   His own death would later emulate this example  202  203  Yet  Cicero could also refer to his popularist opponent Clodius  publicly and scathingly  as a bustuarius   literally  a  funeral man   implying that Clodius has shown the moral temperament of the lowest sort of gladiator  Such finer distinctions aside   gladiator  could be  and was  used as an insult throughout the Roman period  204  For Silius Italicus  who wrote as the games approached their peak  the degenerate Campanians had devised the very worst of precedents  which now threatened the moral fabric of Rome   It was their custom to enliven their banquets with bloodshed and to combine with their feasting the horrid sight of armed men fighting  often the combatants fell dead above the very cups of the revelers  and the tables were stained with streams of blood  Thus demoralised was Capua   205  Death might be rightly meted out as punishment  or met with equanimity in peace or war as a gift of fate  but death inflicted without moral purpose was ignoble  and might pollute and demean those who witnessed it  206  Detail of the Gladiator Mosaic  4th century CE  While the munus itself could be interpreted as pious necessity  the increasing luxuria of munera corroded Roman virtue by encouraging profligacy and the corruptions of self indulgence  such foreign debaucheries whetted un Roman appetites  207  Caesar s 46 BCE ludi were hardly justified as munus after a 20 year interval since his father s death  in which case they were mere entertainment for political gain  Cassius Dio claimed to represent the voices of the Roman street  Caesar s munus was a waste of lives   and of money  better doled out to needy army veterans  208  Yet for Seneca  and for Marcus Aurelius   both professed Stoics   the degradation of gladiators in the munus highlighted their Stoic virtues  their unconditional obedience to their master and to fate  and equanimity in the face of death  Having  neither hope nor illusions   the gladiator could transcend his own debased nature  and disempower death itself by meeting it face to face  Courage  dignity  altruism and loyalty were morally redemptive  Lucian idealised this principle in his story of Sisinnes  who voluntarily fought as a gladiator  earned 10 000 drachmas and used it to buy freedom for his friend  Toxaris  209  Seneca had a lower opinion of the mob s un Stoical appetite for ludi meridiani   Man  is    now slaughtered for jest and sport  and those whom it used to be unholy to train for the purpose of inflicting and enduring wounds are thrust forth exposed and defenceless   168  These accounts seek a higher moral meaning from the munus  but Ovid s very detailed  though satirical  instructions for seduction in the amphitheatre suggest that the spectacles could generate a potent and dangerously sexual atmosphere  118  Augustan seating prescriptions placed women   excepting the Vestals  who were legally inviolate   as far as possible from the action of the arena floor  or tried to  There remained the thrilling possibility of clandestine sexual transgression by high caste spectators and their heroes of the arena  Such assignations were a source for gossip and satire but some became unforgivably public  210  What was the youthful charm that so fired Eppia  What hooked her  What did she see in him to make her put up with being called  the gladiator s moll   Her poppet  her Sergius  was no chicken  with a dud arm that prompted hope of early retirement  Besides his face looked a proper mess  helmet scarred  a great wart on his nose  an unpleasant discharge always trickling from one eye  But he was a gladiator  That word makes the whole breed seem handsome  and made her prefer him to her children and country  her sister  her husband  Steel is what they fall in love with  211  Eppia   a senator s wife   and her Sergius eloped to Egypt  where he deserted her  Most gladiators would have aimed lower  Two wall graffiti in Pompeii describe Celadus the Thraex as  the sigh of the girls  and  the glory of the girls    which may or may not have been Celadus s own wishful thinking  212  In the later Imperial era  Servius Maurus Honoratus uses the same disparaging term as Cicero   bustuarius   for gladiators  213  Tertullian used it somewhat differently   all victims of the arena were sacrificial in his eyes   and expressed the paradox of the arenarii as a class  from a Christian viewpoint  On the one and the same account they glorify them and they degrade and diminish them  yes  further  they openly condemn them to disgrace and civil degradation  they keep them religiously excluded from council chamber  rostrum  senate  knighthood  and every other kind of office and a good many distinctions  The perversity of it  They love whom they lower  they despise whom they approve  the art they glorify  the artist they disgrace  214   edit  Gladiators in Roman art and culture In this new Play  I attempted to follow the old custom of mine  of making a fresh trial  I brought it on again  In the first Act I pleased  when in the meantime a rumor spread that gladiators were about to be exhibited  the populace flock together  make a tumult  clamor aloud  and fight for their places  meantime  I was unable to maintain my place  215  Part of the Gladiator Mosaic  displayed at the Galleria Borghese  It dates from approximately 320 CE  The   symbol  possibly Greek theta  for thanatos  marks a gladiator killed in combat  Images of gladiators could be found throughout the Republic and Empire  among all classes  Walls in the 2nd century BCE  Italian Agora  at Delos were decorated with paintings of gladiators  Mosaics dating from the 2nd through 4th centuries CE have been invaluable in the reconstruction of combat and its rules  gladiator types and the development of the munus  Throughout the Roman world  ceramics  lamps  gems and jewellery  mosaics  reliefs  wall paintings and statuary offer evidence  sometimes the best evidence  of the clothing  props  equipment  names  events  prevalence and rules of gladiatorial combat  Earlier periods provide only occasional  perhaps exceptional examples  87  216  The Gladiator Mosaic in the Galleria Borghese displays several gladiator types  and the Bignor Roman Villa mosaic from Provincial Britain shows Cupids as gladiators  Souvenir ceramics were produced depicting named gladiators in combat  similar images of higher quality  were available on more expensive articles in high quality ceramic  glass or silver  Pliny the Elder gives vivid examples of the popularity of gladiator portraiture in Antium and an artistic treat laid on by an adoptive aristocrat for the solidly plebeian citizens of the Roman Aventine  When a freedman of Nero was giving a gladiatorial show at Antium  the public porticoes were covered with paintings  so we are told  containing life like portraits of all the gladiators and assistants  This portraiture of gladiators has been the highest interest in art for many centuries now  but it was Gaius Terentius who began the practice of having pictures made of gladiatorial shows and exhibited in public  in honour of his grandfather who had adopted him he provided thirty pairs of Gladiators in the Forum for three consecutive days  and exhibited a picture of the matches in the Grove of Diana  217   edit  Modern reconstructions Further information  Roman era historical
