States  1829 1837   Based in frontier Tennessee  Jackson was a politician and army general who defeated the Creek Indians at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend  1814   and the British at the Battle of New Orleans  1815   A polarizing figure who dominated the Second Party System in the 1820s and 1830s  as president he destroyed the national bank and relocated most Indian tribes from the Southeast to west of the Mississippi River  His enthusiastic followers created the modern Democratic Party  The 1830 1850 period later became known as the era of Jacksonian democracy  1  Jackson was nicknamed  Old Hickory  because of his toughness and aggressive personality  he fought in duels  some fatal to his opponents  2  He was a rich slaveholder  who appealed to the common men of the United States  and fought politically against what he denounced as a closed  undemocratic aristocracy  He expanded the spoils system during his presidency to strengthen his political base  Elected president in 1828  Jackson supported a small and limited federal government  He strengthened the power of the presidency  which he saw as spokesman for the entire population  as opposed to Congressmen from a specific small district  He was supportive of states  rights  but during the Nullification Crisis  declared that states do not have the right to nullify federal laws  Strongly against the national bank  he vetoed the renewal of its charter and ensured its collapse  Whigs and moralists denounced his aggressive enforcement of the Indian Removal Act  which resulted in the forced relocation of thousands of Native American tribes to Indian Territory  now Oklahoma   Historians acknowledge his protection of popular democracy and individual liberty for United States citizens  and sometimes criticize him for his support for slavery and for his role in Indian removal  3  4  Contents 1 Early life and education 2 Early military service 3 Legal and political career 4 Military career 4 1 War of 1812 4 2 First

links Early life and education Jackson s Scots Irish heritage celebrated by a mural on Belfast s Shankill Road Jackson was born on March 15  1767  His parents were Scots Irish colonists Andrew and Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson  Presbyterians who had emigrated from Ireland two years earlier  5  6  Jackson s father was born in Carrickfergus  County Antrim  in current day Northern Ireland  around 1738  7  Jackson s parents lived in the village of Boneybefore  also in County Antrim  Their former house is preserved as the Andrew Jackson Centre and is open to the public  When they emigrated to America in 1765  Jackson s parents probably landed in Philadelphia  Pennsylvania  They would have traveled overland down through the Appalachian Mountains to the Scots Irish community in the Waxhaws region  straddling the border between North and South Carolina  8  They brought two children from Ireland  Hugh  born 1763  and Robert  born 1764   Jackson s father died in an accident in February 1767  at the age of 29  three weeks before his son Andrew was born in the Waxhaws area  His exact birth site is unclear because he was born about the time his mother was making a difficult trip home from burying Jackson s father  The area was so remote that the border between North and South Carolina had not officially been surveyed  9  In 1824  Jackson wrote a letter saying that he was born at an uncle s plantation in Lancaster County  South Carolina  But he may have claimed to be a South Carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the Tariff of 1824  which Jackson opposed  In the mid 1850s  second hand evidence indicated that he may have been born at a different uncle s home in North Carolina  9  Jackson received a sporadic education in the local  old field  school  In 1781  he worked for a time in a saddle maker s shop  10  Later  he taught school and studied law in Salisbury  North Carolina  In 1787  he was admitted to the bar  and moved to Jonesborough  in what was then the Western District of North Carolina  This area later became the Southwest Territory  1790   the precursor to the state of Tennessee  Early military service Young Jackson Refusing to Clean Major Coffin s Boots  1876 lithograph   During the American Revolutionary War  Jackson  at age thirteen  joined a local militia as a courier  11  His eldest brother  Hugh  died from heat exhaustion during the Battle of Stono Ferry  on June 20  1779  Jackson and his brother Robert were captured by the British and held as prisoners  they nearly starved to death in captivity  When Jackson refused to clean the boots of a British officer  the officer slashed at the youth with a sword  leaving Jackson with scars on his left hand and head  as well as an intense hatred for the British  12  While imprisoned  the brothers contracted smallpox  Robert Jackson died on April 27  1781  a few days after their mother Elizabeth secured the brothers  release  After being assured Andrew would recover  Elizabeth Jackson volunteered to nurse prisoners of war on board two ships in Charleston harbor  where there had been an outbreak of cholera  She died from the disease in November 1781  and was buried in an unmarked grave  Jackson became an orphan at age 14  12  Following the deaths of his brothers and mother during the war  Jackson blamed the British for his losses  Legal and political career Jackson began his legal career in Jonesborough  now northeastern Tennessee  Though his legal education was scanty  he knew enough to be a country lawyer on the frontier  Since he was not from a distinguished family  he had to make his career by his own merits  soon he began to prosper in the rough and tumble world of frontier law  Most of the actions grew out of disputed land claims  or from assault and battery  In 1788  he was appointed Solicitor  prosecutor  of the Western District and held the same position in the government of the Territory South of the River Ohio after 1791  Jackson was elected as a delegate to the Tennessee constitutional convention in 1796  When Tennessee achieved statehood that year  Jackson was elected its U S  Representative  The following year  he was elected U S  Senator as a Democratic Republican  but he resigned within a year  In 1798  he was appointed a judge of the Tennessee Supreme Court  serving until 1804  13  In addition to his legal and political career  Jackson prospered as planter  slave owner  and merchant  He built a home and the first general store in Gallatin  Tennessee in 1803  The next year he acquired the Hermitage  a 640 acre  259 ha  plantation in Davidson County  near Nashville  Jackson later added 360 acres  146 ha  to the plantation  which eventually grew to 1 050 acres  425 ha   The primary crop was cotton  grown by enslaved workers  Starting with nine slaves  Jackson held as many as 44 by 1820  and later held up to 150 slaves  making him among the planter elite  Throughout his lifetime Jackson may have owned as many as 300 slaves  14  15  Jackson was a major land speculator in West Tennessee after he had negotiated the sale of the land from the Chickasaw Nation in 1818  termed the Jackson Purchase   He was one of the three original investors who founded Memphis  Tennessee in 1819  see History of Memphis  Tennessee   16  Military career War of 1812 Main articles  Creek War and Battle of New Orleans Jackson was appointed commander of the Tennessee militia in 1801  with the rank of colonel  He was later elected major general of the Tennessee militia in 1802  17  During the War of 1812  the Shawnee chief Tecumseh encouraged the  Red Stick  Creek Indians of northern Alabama and Georgia to attack white settlements  He had unified tribes in the Northwest to rise up against the Americans  trying to repel European American settlers from those lands north of the Ohio  Four hundred settlers were killed in the Fort Mims massacre  In the resulting Creek War  Jackson commanded the American forces  which included Tennessee militia  U S  regulars  and Cherokee  Choctaw  and Lower Creek warriors  Jackson defeated the Red Sticks at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814  US forces and their allies killed 800 Red Stick warriors in this battle  but Jackson spared the chief Red Eagle  a mixed race man also known as William Weatherford  Sam Houston and David Crockett served under Jackson in this campaign  After the victory  Jackson imposed the Treaty of Fort Jackson upon both the Upper Creek enemies and the Lower Creek allies  wresting twenty million acres  81 000 km   in present day Georgia and Alabama from all the Creek for European American settlement  Jackson was appointed Major General after this action  The Battle of New Orleans  General Andrew Jackson stands on the parapet of his makeshift defenses as his troops repulse attacking Highlanders  by painter Edward Percy Moran in 1910  Jackson s service in the War of 1812 against the United Kingdom was conspicuous for bravery and success  When British forces threatened New Orleans  Jackson took command of the defenses  including militia from several western states and territories  He was a strict officer but was popular with his troops  They said he was  tough as old hickory  wood on the battlefield  and he acquired the nickname of  Old Hickory   In the Battle of New Orleans on January 8  1815  Jackson s 5 000 soldiers won a decisive victory over 7 500 British  At the end of the battle  the British had 2 037 casualties  291 dead  including three senior generals   1 262 wounded  and 484 captured or missing  The Americans had 71 casualties  13 dead  39 wounded  and 19 missing  18  Jackson became a national hero for his actions in this battle and the war  He received the Thanks of Congress and a gold medal by resolution of February 27  1815  Alexis de Tocqueville later commented in Democracy in America that Jackson     was raised to the Presidency  and has been maintained there  solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained  twenty years ago  under the walls of New Orleans   First Seminole War Main article  Seminole Wars Jackson served in the military again during the First Seminole War  He was ordered by President James Monroe in December 1817 to lead a campaign in Georgia against the Seminole and Creek Indians  Jackson was also charged with preventing Spanish Florida from becoming a refuge for runaway slaves  Critics later alleged that Jackson exceeded orders in his Florida actions  His directions were to  terminate the conflict   19  Jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize Florida  Before going  Jackson wrote to Monroe   Let it be signified to me through any channel     that the possession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States  and in sixty days it will be accomplished   20  Monroe gave Jackson orders that were purposely ambiguous  sufficient for international denials  Military governor Jackson was sworn in at Plaza Ferdinand VII in Pensacola  Florida The Seminole attacked Jackson s Tennessee volunteers  The Seminole attack left their villages vulnerable  and Jackson burned their houses and the crops  He found letters that indicated that the Spanish and British were secretly assisting the Indians  Jackson believed that the United States could not be secure as long as Spain and the United Kingdom encouraged Indians to fight  and argued that his actions were undertaken in self defense  Jackson captured Pensacola  Florida  with little more than some warning shots  and deposed the Spanish governor  He captured and then tried and executed two British subjects  Robert Ambrister and Alexander Arbuthnot  who had been supplying and advising the Indians  Jackson s actions struck fear into the Seminole tribes as word spread of his ruthlessness in battle  he became known as  Sharp Knife    The executions  and Jackson s invasion of territory belonging to Spain  a country with which the U S  was not at war  created an international incident  Many in the Monroe administration called for Jackson to be censured  The Secretary of State  John Quincy Adams  an early believer in Manifest Destiny  defended Jackson  When the Spanish minister demanded a  suitable punishment  for Jackson  Adams wrote back   Spain must immediately  decide  either to place a force in Florida adequate at once to the protection of her territory     or cede to the United States a province  of which she retains nothing but the nominal possession  but which is  in fact     a post of annoyance to them   21  Adams used Jackson s conquest  and Spain s own weakness  to get Spain to cede Florida to the United States by the Adams On s Treaty  Jackson was subsequently named Florida s military governor and served from March 10  1821  to December 31  1821  Election of 1824 Main article  United States presidential election  1824 Jackson in 1824  painting by Thomas Sully The Tennessee legislature nominated Jackson for President in 1822  It also elected him U S  Senator again  By 1824  the Democratic Republican Party had become the only functioning national party  Its Presidential candidates had been chosen by an informal Congressional nominating caucus  but this had become unpopular  In 1824  most of the Democratic Republicans in Congress boycotted the caucus  Those who attended backed Treasury Secretary William H  Crawford for President and Albert Gallatin for Vice President  A Pennsylvanian convention nominated Jackson for President a month later  stating that the irregular caucus ignored the  voice of the people  and was a  vain hope that the American people might be thus deceived into a belief that he  Crawford  was the regular democratic candidate   22  Gallatin criticized Jackson as  an honest man and the idol of the worshippers of military glory  but from incapacity  military habits  and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions  altogether unfit for the office   23  Besides Jackson and Crawford  the Secretary of State John Quincy Adams and House Speaker Henry Clay were also candidates  Jackson received the most popular votes  but not a majority  and four states had no popular ballot   The electoral votes were split four ways  with Jackson having a plurality  Since no candidate received a majority  the election was decided by the House of Representatives  which chose Adams  Jackson supporters denounced this result as a  corrupt bargain  because Clay gave his state s support to Adams  who subsequently appointed Clay as Secretary of State  As none of Kentucky s electors had initially voted for Adams  and Jackson had won the popular vote  some Kentucky politicians criticized Clay for violating the will of the people in return for personal political favors  Jackson s defeat burnished his political credentials  however  many voters believed the  man of the people  had been robbed by the  corrupt aristocrats of the East   Election of 1828 Equestrian statue

the Presidency  The Tennessee legislature again nominated Jackson for President  Jackson attracted Vice President John C  Calhoun  Martin Van Buren  and Thomas Ritchie into his camp  Van Buren and Ritchie were previous supporters of Crawford   Van Buren  with help from his friends in Philadelphia and Richmond  revived the old Republican Party  gave it a new name as the Democratic Party   restored party rivalries   and forged a national organization of durability  24  The Jackson coalition handily defeated Adams in 1828  During the election  Jackson s opponents referred to him as a  jackass   Jackson liked the name and used the jackass as a symbol for a while  but it died out  However  it later became the symbol for the Democratic Party when cartoonist Thomas Nast popularized it  25  The campaign was very much a personal one  As was the custom at the time  neither candidate personally campaigned  but their political followers organized many campaign events  Both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press  which reached a low point when the press accused Jackson s wife Rachel of bigamy  Though the accusation was true  as were most personal attacks leveled against him during the campaign  it was based on events that occurred many years prior  1791 to 1794   Jackson said he would forgive those who insulted him  but he would never forgive the ones who attacked his wife  Rachel died suddenly on December 22  1828  before his inauguration  and was buried on Christmas Eve  Inauguration Main article  First inauguration of Andrew Jackson Jackson was the first President to invite the public to attend the White House ball honoring his first inauguration  Many poor people came to the inaugural ball in their homemade clothes  The crowd became so large that Jackson s guards could not keep them out of the White House  which became so crowded with people that dishes and decorative pieces inside were eventually broken  Some people stood on good chairs in muddied boots just to get a look at the President  The crowd had become so wild that the attendants poured punch in tubs and put it on the White House lawn to lure people outside  Jackson s raucous populism earned him the nickname  King Mob   Election of 1832 Main article  United States presidential election  1832 In the 1832 presidential election  Jackson easily won reelection as the candidate of the Democratic Party against Henry Clay  of the National Republican Party  and William Wirt  of the Anti Masonic Party  Jackson jettisoned Vice President John C  Calhoun because of his support for nullification and involvement in the Petticoat affair  replacing him with longtime confidant Martin Van Buren of New York  Presidency 1829 1837 See also  Jacksonian democracy The Jackson Cabinet

entire national debt  the only time in U S  history that has been accomplished  26  27  The accomplishment was short lived  A severe depression from 1837 to 1844 caused a tenfold increase in national debt within its first year  28  Electoral College Jackson repeatedly called for the abolition of the Electoral College by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to Congress as President  29  30  In his third annual message to Congress  he expressed the view  I have heretofore recommended amendments of the Federal Constitution giving the election of President and Vice President to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term  So important do I consider these changes in our fundamental law that I can not  in accordance with my sense of duty  omit to press them upon the consideration of a new Congress   31  Spoils system Main article  Spoils system When Jackson became President  he implemented the theory of rotation in office by political appointments  declaring it  a leading principle in the republican creed   29  He believed that rotation in office would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy  To strengthen party loyalty  Jackson s supporters wanted to give the posts to party members  a patronage system  In practice  this meant replacing federal employees with friends or party loyalists  32  By the end of his term  Jackson dismissed nearly 20  of the Federal employees at the start of it  replacing them with political appointees from his party  33  While Jackson did not start the  spoils system   he did encourage its growth for many years to come  It led to its own kind of corruption  including the appointment of officials with no experience related to their responsibilities  citation needed  Opposition to the National Bank Main article  Bank War Democratic cartoon shows Jackson fighting the monster Bank   The Bank   Jackson told Martin Van Buren   is trying to kill me  but I will kill it   1833 Democratic cartoon shows Jackson destroying the devil s Bank The Second Bank of the United States was authorized for a 20 year period during James Madison s tenure in 1816  As President  Jackson worked to rescind the bank s federal charter  In Jackson s veto message  the bank needed to be abolished because  It concentrated the nation s financial strength in a single institution  It exposed the government to control by foreign interests  It served mainly to make the rich richer  It exercised too much control over members of Congress  It favored northeastern states over southern and western states  Banks are controlled by a few select families  Following Jefferson  Jackson supported an  agricultural republic  and felt the Bank improved the fortunes of an  elite circle  of commercial and industrial entrepreneurs at the expense of farmers and laborers  After a titanic struggle  Jackson succeeded in destroying the Bank by vetoing its 1832 re charter by Congress and by withdrawing U S  funds in 1833   See Banking in the Jacksonian Era  The bank s money lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that sprang up  This increased credit and speculation  At first  as Jackson withdrew money from the Bank to invest it in other banks  land sales  canal construction  cotton production  and manufacturing boomed  34  Then  in 1836  Jackson issued the Specie Circular  which required buyers of government lands to pay in  specie   gold or silver coins   The result was a great demand for specie  which many banks did not have enough of to exchange for their notes  These banks collapsed  34  This was a direct cause of the Panic of 1837  which threw the national economy into a deep depression  It took years for the economy to recover from the damage  35  The U S  Senate censured Jackson on March 28  1834  for his action in removing U S  funds from the Bank of the United States  When the Jacksonians had a majority in the Senate  the censure was expunged  Nullification crisis Main article  Nullification Crisis Another notable crisis during Jackson s period of office was the  Nullification Crisis   or  secession crisis   of 1828   1832  which merged issues of sectional strife with disagreements over tariffs  Critics alleged that high tariffs  the  Tariff of Abominations   on imports of common manufactured goods made in Europe made those goods more expensive than ones from the northern U S   raising the prices paid by planters in the South  Southern politicians argued that tariffs benefited northern industrialists at the expense of southern farmers  The issue came to a head when Vice President Calhoun  in the South Carolina Exposition and Protest of 1828  supported the claim of his home state  South Carolina  that it had the right to  nullify  declare void the tariff legislation of 1828  and more generally the right of a state to nullify any Federal laws that went against its interests  Although Jackson sympathized with the South in the tariff debate  he was also a strong supporter of a strong union  with effective powers for the central government  Jackson attempted to face down Calhoun over the issue  which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men  Particularly notable was an incident at the April 13  1830  Jefferson Day dinner  involving after dinner toasts  Robert Hayne began by toasting to  The Union of the States  and the Sovereignty of the States   Jackson then rose  and in a booming voice added  Our federal Union  It must be preserved     a clear challenge to Calhoun  Calhoun clarified his position by responding  The Union  Next to our Liberty  the most dear   36  Jackson Presidential Dollar The relationship between Jackson and Calhoun was further strained when the Vice President s wife  Floride Calhoun  led several other Cabinet members and their wives in the social ostracism of Secretary of War John H  Eaton and his wife  Margaret O Neill Eaton in what became known as the Petticoat affair  causing further resignations from Jackson s cabinet  leading to its reorganization as the  Kitchen Cabinet   Martin Van Buren  despite resigning as Secretary of State  played a leading role in the new unofficial cabinet  37  At the first Democratic National Convention  privately engineered by members of the Kitchen Cabinet 38  following the Petticoat Affair  Calhoun and Jackson broke apart politically from one another  and Van Buren replaced Calhoun as Jackson s running mate in the 1832 presidential election   In December 1832  Calhoun resigned as Vice President to become a U S  Senator for South Carolina  In response to South Carolina s nullification claim  Jackson vowed to send troops to South Carolina to enforce the laws  In December  1832  he issued a resounding proclamation against the  nullifiers   stating that he considered  the power to annul a law of the United States  assumed by one State  incompatible with the existence of the Union  contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution  unauthorized by its spirit  inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded  and destructive of the great object for which it was formed   South Carolina  the President declared  stood on  the brink of insurrection and treason   and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that Union for which their ancestors had fought  Jackson also denied the right of secession   The Constitution    forms a government not a league    To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States is not a nation   39  Jackson asked Congress to pass a  Force Bill  explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff  but its passage was delayed until protectionists led by Clay agreed to a reduced Compromise Tariff  The Force Bill and Compromise Tariff passed on March 1  1833  and Jackson signed both  The South Carolina Convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance  The Force Bill became moot because it was no longer needed  On May 1  1833  Jackson wrote   the tariff was only the pretext  and disunion and southern confederacy the real object  The next pretext will be the negro  or slavery question    40  Indian removal Main article  Indian removal Jackson in 1845 Perhaps the most controversial aspect of Jackson s presidency was his policy regarding Native Americans  which involved the ethnic cleansing of several Indian tribes  41  42  Jackson was a leading advocate of a policy known as Indian removal  Jackson had been negotiating treaties and removal policies with Indian leaders for years before his election as president  Many tribes and portions of tribes had been removed to Arkansas Territory and further west of the Mississippi River without the suffering of what later became known as the Trail of Tears  Further  many white Americans advocated total extermination of the  savages   particularly those who had experienced frontier wars  Jackson s support of removal policies can be best understood by examination of those prior cases he had personally negotiated  rather than those in post presidential years  Nevertheless  Jackson is often held responsible for all that took place in the 1830s  In his December 8  1829  First Annual Message to Congress  Jackson stated  This emigration should be voluntary  for it would be as cruel as unjust to compel the aborigines to abandon the graves of their fathers and seek a home in a distant land  But they should be distinctly informed that if they remain within the limits of the States they must be subject to their laws  In return for their obedience as individuals they will without doubt be protected in the enjoyment of those possessions which they have improved by their industry  43  Before his election as president  Jackson had been involved with the issue of Indian removal for over ten years  The removal of the Native Americans to the west of the Mississippi River had been a major part of his political agenda in both the 1824 and 1828 presidential elections  44  After his election he signed the Indian Removal Act into law in 1830  The Act authorized the President to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands further west  outside of existing U S  state borders  While frequently frowned upon in the North  and opposed by Jeremiah Evarts and Theodore Frelinghuysen  the Removal Act was popular in the South  where population growth and the discovery of gold on Cherokee land had increased pressure on tribal lands  The state of Georgia became involved in a contentious jurisdictional dispute with the Cherokees  culminating in the 1832 U S  Supreme Court decision  Worcester v  Georgia   which ruled that Georgia could not impose its laws upon Cherokee tribal lands  Jackson is often quoted  regarding the decision  as having said   John Marshall has made his decision  now let him enforce it   According to Remini  Jackson never said this  as the quote first appeared in Horace Greeley s The American Conflict in 1864  45  46  Photograph of Jackson at age 78  1844 45 In any case  Jackson used the Georgia crisis to pressure Cherokee leaders to sign a removal treaty  A small faction of Cherokees led by John Ridge negotiated the Treaty of New Echota with Jackson s representatives  Ridge was not a recognized leader of the Cherokee Nation  and this document was rejected by most Cherokees as illegitimate  47  Over 15 000 Cherokees signed a petition in protest of the proposed removal  the list was ignored by the Supreme Court and the U S  legislature  in part due to delays and timing  48  The treaty was enforced by Jackson s successor  Van Buren  who ordered 7 000 armed troops to remove the Cherokees  Due to the infighting between political factions  many Cherokees thought their appeals were still being considered until troops arrived  49  This abrupt and forced removal resulted in the deaths of over 4 000 Cherokees on the  Trail of Tears   A daguerreotype of Jackson  By the 1830s  under constant pressure from settlers  each of the five southern tribes had ceded most of its lands  but sizable self government groups lived in Georgia  Alabama  Mississippi  and Florida  All of these  except the Seminoles  had moved far in the coexistence with whites  and they resisted suggestions that they should voluntarily remove themselves  Their nonviolent methods earned them the title the Five Civilized Tribes  50  More than 45 000 American Indians were relocated to the West during Jackson s administration  A few Cherokees escaped forced relocation  or walked back afterwards  escaping to the high Smoky Mountains along the North Carolina and Tennessee border  51  Jackson s administration bought about 100 million acres  400 000 km   of Indian land for about  68 million and 32 million acres  130 000 km   of western land  Jackson was criticized at the time for his role in these events  and the criticism has grown over the years  U S  historian Robert V  Remini characterizes the Indian Removal era as  one of the unhappiest chapters in American history   52  Attack and assassination attempt Richard Lawrence s attempt on Jackson s life  as depicted in an 1835 etching  The first presidential attack was against Jackson  Jackson ordered the dismissal of Robert B  Randolph from the Navy for embezzlement  On May 6  1833  Jackson sailed on USS Cygnet to Fredericksburg  Virginia  where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of Mary Ball Washington  George Washington s mother  During a stopover near Alexandria  Randolph appeared and struck the President  He fled the scene chased by several members of Jackson s party  including the well known writer Washington Irving  Jackson decided not to press charges  10  On January 30  1835  what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting President of the United States occurred just outside the United States Capitol  When Jackson was leaving through the East Portico after the funeral of South Carolina Representative Warren R  Davis  Richard Lawrence  an unemployed housepainter from England  aimed a pistol at Jackson  which misfired  Lawrence pulled out a second pistol  which also misfired  Historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring  53  Lawrence was restrained  and legend says that Jackson attacked Lawrence with his cane  Others present  including David Crockett  restrained and disarmed Lawrence  Lawrence told doctors later his reasons for the shooting  He blamed Jackson for the loss of his job  He claimed that with the President dead   money would be more plenty   a reference to Jackson s struggle with the Bank of the United States  and that he  could not rise until the President fell   Finally  he told his interrogators that he was a deposed English King specifically  Richard III  dead since 1485 and that Jackson was his clerk  He was deemed insane and institutionalized  Afterward  due to public curiosity concerning the double misfires  the pistols were tested and retested  Each time they performed perfectly  Many believed that Jackson had been protected by the same Providence that protected the young nation  This national pride was a large part of the Jacksonian cultural myth fueling American expansion in the 1830s  Clipper ship Andrew Jackson Judicial appointments Main article  List of federal judges appointed by Andrew Jackson In total Jackson appointed 24 federal judges  six Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States and eighteen judges to the United States district courts  Supreme Court appointments John McLean   1830  Henry Baldwin   1830  James Moore Wayne   1835  Roger Brooke Taney  Chief Justice    1836  Philip Pendleton Barbour   1836  John Catron   1837  Major Supreme Court cases Cherokee Nation v  Georgia   1831  Worcester v  Georgia   1832  Charles River Bridge v  Warren Bridge   1837  States admitted to the Union Arkansas   June 15  1836  Michigan   January 26  1837  Regrets On the last day of the presidency  Jackson admitted that he had but two regrets  that he  had been unable to shoot Henry Clay or to hang John C  Calhoun   54  Family and personal life Daguerreotype of Andrew Jackson at age 77 or 78  1844 or 1845  Shortly after Jackson first arrived in Nashville in 1788  he lived as a boarder with Rachel Stockley Donelson  the widow of John Donelson  Here Jackson became acquainted with their daughter  Rachel Donelson Robards  At the time  Rachel Robards was in an unhappy marriage with Captain Lewis Robards  a man subject to irrational dubious   discuss  fits of jealous rage  Due to Lewis Robards  temperament  the two were separated in 1790  According to Jackson  he married Rachel after hearing that Robards had obtained a divorce  However  the divorce had never been completed  making Rachel s marriage to Jackson technically bigamous and therefore invalid  After the divorce was officially completed  Rachel and Jackson remarried in 1794  55  To complicate matters further  evidence shows that Donelson had been living with Jackson and referred to herself as Mrs  Jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made  56  It was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially  as long as they were recognized by the community  The controversy surrounding their marriage remained a sore point for Jackson  who deeply resented attacks on his wife s honor  With his anger over attacks about Rachel  and his participation in violent confrontations  Jackson gained a reputation as a quarrelsome and vengeful man  57  By May 1806  Charles Dickinson had published an attack on Jackson in the local newspaper  and it resulted in a written challenge from Jackson to a duel  In the duel  Dickinson shot Jackson in the ribs before Jackson returned the fatal shot  Since Dickinson was considered an expert shot  Jackson and his friend  Thomas Overton  determined it would be best to let Dickinson turn and fire first  hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness  Jackson would wait and take careful aim at Dickinson  Dickinson did fire first  hitting Jackson in the chest  Under the rules of dueling  Dickinson had to remain still as Jackson took aim and shot and killed him  However  the bullet that struck Jackson was so close to his heart that it could never be safely removed  Jackson had been wounded so frequently in duels that it was said he  rattled like a bag of marbles   58  Jackson s reputation suffered greatly from the duel  59  Rachel died of a heart attack on December 22  1828  two weeks after her husband s victory in the election and two months before Jackson took office as President  Jackson blamed John Quincy Adams for Rachel s death because the episode ridiculing his wife was repeatedly used in the campaign of 1828  He felt that this had hastened her death and never forgave Adams  60  Jackson had three adopted sons  Theodore  an Indian about whom little is known  61  Andrew Jackson Jr   the son of Rachel s brother Severn Donelson  and Lyncoya  a Creek Indian orphan adopted by Jackson after the Creek War  Lyncoya died of tuberculosis in 1828  at the age of sixteen  62  Tennessee Gentleman  portrait of Jackson  ca  1831  from the collection of The Hermitage  The Jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children  John Samuel Donelson  Daniel Smith Donelson and Andrew Jackson Donelson were the sons of Rachel s brother Samuel Donelson  who died in 1804  Andrew Jackson Hutchings was Rachel s orphaned grand nephew  Caroline Butler  Eliza Butler  Edward Butler  and Anthony Butler were the orphaned children of Edward Butler  a family friend  They came to live with the Jacksons after the death of their father  63  The widower Jackson invited Rachel s niece Emily Donelson to serve as host at the White House  Emily was married to Andrew Jackson Donelson  who acted as Jackson s private secretary and in 1856 would run for Vice President on the American Party ticket  The relationship between the President and Emily became strained during the Petticoat affair  and the two became estranged for over a year  They eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as White House host  Sarah Yorke Jackson  the wife of Andrew Jackson Jr   became cohost of the White House in 1834  It was the only time in history when two women simultaneously acted as unofficial First Lady  Sarah took over all hosting duties after Emily died from tuberculosis in 1836  Jackson used Rip Raps as a retreat  visiting between August 19  1829 through August 16  1835  64  Jackson remained influential in both national and state politics after retiring to The Hermitage in 1837  Jackson remained a firm advocate of the federal union of the states  and rejected any talk of secession   I will die with the Union   he always insisted  65  The tomb of Andrew and Rachel Donelson Jackson located at their home  The Hermitage  Jackson was a lean figure standing at 6 feet  1 inch  1 85 m  tall  and weighing between 130 and 140 pounds  64 kg  on average  Jackson also had an unruly shock of red hair  which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age 61  He had penetrating deep blue eyes  Jackson was one of the more sickly presidents  suffering from chronic headaches  abdominal pains  and a hacking cough  caused by a musket ball in his lung that was never removed  that often brought up blood and sometimes made his whole body shake  After retiring to Nashville  he enjoyed eight years of retirement and died at The Hermitage on June 8  1845  at the age of 78  of chronic tuberculosis  dropsy  and heart failure  In his will  Jackson left his entire estate to his adopted son  Andrew Jackson Jr   except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various other friends and family members  About a year after retiring the presidency  66  Jackson became a member of the First Presbyterian Church in Nashville  Jackson on U S  Postage Andrew Jackson is one of the few American presidents ever to appear on US Postage more than the usual two or three times  He died in 1845  but the U S  Post Office did not release a postage stamp in his honor until 18 years after his death  with the issue of 1863  a 2 cent black issue  commonly referred to by collectors as the  Black Jack   In contrast  the first Warren G  Harding stamp was released only one month after his death  Lincoln  one year exactly  As Jackson was a controversial figure in his day there is speculation that officials in Washington chose to wait a period of time before issuing a stamp with his portrait  In all  Jackson has appeared on thirteen different US postage stamps  more than that of most US presidents and second only to the number of times Washington  Franklin and Lincoln have appeared  67  68  During the American Civil War the Confederate government also issued two Confederate postage stamps bearing Jackson s portrait  one a 2 cent red stamp and the other a 2 cent green stamp  both issued in 1863  69  Jackson also appears on other U S  Postage stamps of the 19th and 20th centuries  In all  Jackson appears on twelve US Postage stamps to date  Issue of 1863   Issue of 1870   Issue of 1903   Memorials
