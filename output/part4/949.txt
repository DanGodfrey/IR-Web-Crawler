of the term weapon of mass destruction The first use of the term  weapon of mass destruction  on record is by Cosmo Gordon Lang  Archbishop of Canterbury  in 1937 in reference to the aerial bombardment of Guernica  Spain    Who can think at this present time without a sickening of the heart of the appalling slaughter  the suffering  the manifold misery brought by war to Spain and to China  Who can think without horror of what another widespread war would mean  waged as it would be with all the new weapons of mass destruction  1    At that time  there were no nuclear weapons  Japan conducted research on biological weapons  see Unit 731   2  and chemical weapons had seen wide use  most notably in World War I  Following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki  and progressing through the Cold War  the term came to refer more to non conventional weapons  The application of the term to specifically nuclear and radiological weapons is traced by William Safire to the Russian phrase                                oruzhiye massovogo porazheniya  weapons of mass destruction   He credits James Goodby  of the Brookings Institution  with tracing what he considers the earliest known English language use soon after the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki  although it is not quite verbatim   a communique from a 15 November 1945  meeting of Harry Truman  Clement Attlee and Mackenzie King  probably drafted by Vannevar Bush  or so Bush claimed in 1970  referred to  weapons adaptable to mass destruction   That exact phrase  says Safire  was also used by Bernard Baruch in 1946  in a speech at the United Nations probably written by Herbert Bayard Swope   3  The same phrase found its way into the very first resolution adopted by the United Nations General assembly in January 1946 in London  which used the wording     the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other weapons adaptable to mass destruction   4  This resolution also created the Atomic Energy Commission  predecessor of the International Atomic Energy Agency  IAEA    An exact use of this term was given in a lecture  Atomic Energy as an Atomic Problem  by J  Robert Oppenheimer  The lecture was delivered to the Foreign Service and the State Department  on 17 September 1947  The lecture is reprinted in The Open Mind  New York  Simon and Schuster  1955    It is a very far reaching control which would eliminate the rivalry between nations in this field  which would prevent the surreptitious arming of one nation against another  which would provide some cushion of time before atomic attack  and presumably therefore before any attack with weapons of mass destruction  and which would go a long way toward removing atomic energy at least as a source of conflict between the powers   The term was also used in the introduction to the hugely influential US Government Document known as NSC 68 written in April 1950  5  During a televised presentation about the Cuban Missile Crisis on 22 October 1962  John F  Kennedy made reference to  offensive weapons of sudden mass destruction  6    An early use of the exact phrase in an international treaty was in the Outer Space Treaty of 1967  however no definition was provided   edit  Evolution of its use During the Cold War  the term  weapons of mass destruction  was primarily a reference to nuclear weapons  At the time  in the West the euphemism  strategic weapons  was used to refer to the American nuclear arsenal  which was presented as a necessary deterrent against nuclear or conventional attack from the Soviet Union  see Mutual Assured Destruction   The term  weapons of mass destruction  continued to see periodic use throughout this time  usually in the context of nuclear arms control  Ronald Reagan used it during the 1986 Reykjav k Summit  when referring to the 1967 Outer Space Treaty  7  Reagan s successor  George H W  Bush  used the term in an 1989 speech to the United Nations  using it primarily in reference to chemical arms  8  The end of the Cold War reduced U S  reliance on nuclear weapons as a deterrent  causing it to shift its focus to disarmament  This period coincided with an increasing threat to U S  interests from Islamic nations and independent Islamic groups  With the 1990 invasion of Kuwait and 1991 Gulf War  Iraq s nuclear  biological  and chemical weapons programs became a particular concern of the first Bush Administration  9  Following the war  Bill Clinton and other western politicians and media continued to use the term  usually in reference to ongoing attempts to dismantle Iraq s weapons programs  citation needed  After the 11 September 2001 attacks and the 2001 anthrax attacks  an increased fear of non conventional weapons and asymmetrical warfare took hold of the United States and other Western powers  This fear reached a crescendo with the 2002 Iraq disarmament crisis and the alleged existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that became the primary justification for the 2003 invasion of Iraq  However  no WMD were found in Iraq  Because of its prolific use during this period  the American Dialect Society voted  weapons of mass destruction   and its abbreviation   WMD   the word of the year in 2002  10  and in 2003 Lake Superior State University added WMD to its list of terms banished for  Mis use  Over use and General Uselessness   11   edit  Definitions of the term  edit  United States  edit  Strategic The most widely used definition of  weapons of mass destruction  is that of nuclear  biological or chemical weapons  NBC  although there is no treaty or customary international law that contains an authoritative definition  Instead  international law has been used with respect to the specific categories of weapons within WMD  and not to WMD as a whole  The acronyms NBC  for nuclear  biological and chemical  or CBR  chemical  biological  radiological  are used with regards to battlefield protection systems for armored vehicles  because all three involve insidious toxins that can be carried through the air and can be protected against with vehicle air filtration systems  However  there is an argument that nuclear and biological weapons do not belong in the same category as chemical and  dirty bomb  radiological weapons  which have limited destructive potential  and close to none  as far as property is concerned   whereas nuclear and biological weapons have the unique ability to kill large numbers of people with very small amounts of material  and thus could be said to belong in a class by themselves  The NBC definition has also been used in official U S  documents  by the U S  President  12  13  the U S  Central Intelligence Agency  14  the U S  Department of Defense  15  16  and the U S  Government Accountability Office  17  Other documents expand the definition of WMD to also include radiological or conventional weapons  The U S  military refers to WMD as  Chemical  biological  radiological  or nuclear weapons capable of a high order of destruction or causing mass casualties and exclude the means of transporting or propelling the weapon where such means is a separable and divisible part from the weapon  Also called WMD  18  The significance of the words separable and divisible part of the weapon is that missiles such as the Pershing II and the SCUD are considered weapons of mass destruction  while aircraft capable of carrying bombloads are not  In 2004  the United Kingdom s Butler Review recognized the  considerable and long standing academic debate about the proper interpretation of the phrase  weapons of mass destruction    The committee set out to avoid the general term but when using it  employed the definition of United Nations Security Council Resolution 687  which defined the systems which Iraq was required to abandon   Nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons usable material or any sub systems or components or any research  development  support or manufacturing facilities relating to  nuclear weapons   Chemical and biological weapons and all stocks of agents and all related subsystems and components and all research development support and manufacturing facilities  Ballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 kilometres and related major parts  and repair and production facilities   19  Chemical weapons expert Gert G  Harigel considers only nuclear weapons true weapons of mass destruction  because  only nuclear weapons are completely indiscriminate by their explosive power  heat radiation and radioactivity  and only they should therefore be called a weapon of mass destruction   He prefers to call chemical and biological weapons  weapons of terror  when aimed against civilians and  weapons of intimidation  for soldiers  Testimony of one such soldier expresses the same viewpoint  20  For a period of several months in the winter of 2002 2003  U S  Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz frequently used the term  weapons of mass terror   apparently also recognizing the distinction between the psychological and the physical effects of many things currently falling into the WMD category  Gustavo Bell Lemus  the Vice President of Colombia  at the 2001 United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects  quoted the Millennium Report of the UN Secretary General to the General Assembly  in which Kofi Annan said that small arms could be described as WMD because the fatalities they cause  dwarf that of all other weapons systems   and in most years greatly exceed the toll of the atomic bombs that devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki   21  An additional condition often implicitly applied to WMD is that the use of the weapons must be strategic  In other words  they would be designed to  have consequences far outweighing the size and effectiveness of the weapons themselves   22  The strategic nature of WMD also defines their function in the military doctrine of total war as targeting the means a country would use to support and supply its war effort  specifically its population  industry  and natural resources  Within U S  civil defense organizations  the category is now Chemical  Biological  Radiological  Nuclear  and Explosive  CBRNE   which defines WMD as   1  Any explosive  incendiary  poison gas  bomb  grenade  or rocket having a propellant charge of more than four ounces  113 g   missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of more than one quarter ounce  7 g   or mine or device similar to the above   2  Poison gas   3  Any weapon involving a disease organism   4  Any weapon that is designed to release radiation at a level dangerous to human life  citation needed   edit  Military For the general purposes of national defense  23  US Code 24  defines a weapon of mass destruction as  any weapon or device that is intended  or has the capability  to cause death or serious bodily injury to a significant number of people through the release  dissemination  or impact of  toxic or poisonous chemicals or their precursors a disease organism radiation or radioactivity 25  For the purposes of the prevention of weapons proliferation  26  US Code defines weapons of mass destruction as  chemical  biological  and nuclear weapons  and chemical  biological  and nuclear materials used in the manufacture of such weapons   27   edit  Criminal  Civilian  For the purposes of US Criminal law concerning terrorism  28  weapons of mass destruction are defined as  any destructive device defined as any explosive  incendiary  or poison gas bomb  grenade  rocket having a propellant charge of more than four ounces  missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of more than one quarter ounce  mine  or device similar to any of the devices described in the preceding clauses 29  any weapon that is designed or intended to cause death or serious bodily injury through the release  dissemination  or impact of toxic or poisonous chemicals  or their precursors any weapon involving a biological agent  toxin  or vector any weapon that is designed to release radiation or radioactivity at a level dangerous to human life 30  The Federal Bureau of Investigation s definition is similar to that presented above from the terrorism statute  31  any explosive or incendiary device  as defined in Title 18 USC  Section 921  bomb  grenade  rocket  missile  mine  or other device with a charge of more than four ounces any weapon designed or intended to cause death or serious bodily injury through the release  dissemination  or impact of toxic or poisonous chemicals or their precursors any weapon involving a disease organism any weapon designed to release radiation or radioactivity at a level dangerous to human life any device or weapon designed or intended to cause death or serious bodily injury by causing a malfunction of or destruction of an aircraft or other vehicle that carries humans or of an aircraft or other vehicle whose malfunction or destruction may cause said aircraft or other vehicle to cause death or serious bodily injury to humans who may be within range of the vector in its course of travel or the travel of its debris  Indictments and convictions for possession and use of WMD such as truck bombs  32  pipe bombs  33  shoe bombs  34  cactus needles coated with botulin toxin  35  etc  have been obtained under 18 USC 2332a  The Washington Post reported on 30 March 2006   Jurors asked the judge in the death penalty trial of Zacarias Moussaoui today to define the term  weapons of mass destruction  and were told it includes airplanes used as missiles   Moussaoui was indicted and tried for the use of airplanes as WMD   edit

country to have used a nuclear weapon in war is the United States  which dropped two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II  There are eight countries that have declared they possess nuclear weapons and are known to have tested a nuclear weapon  only five of which are members of the NPT  The eight are China  France  India  North Korea  Pakistan  Russia  the United Kingdom  and the United States  Israel is considered by most analysts to have nuclear weapons numbering in the low hundreds as well  but maintains an official policy of nuclear ambiguity  neither denying nor confirming its nuclear status  Iran is suspected by western countries of seeking nuclear weapons  a claim that it denies  While the truth is unknown  the November 2007 NIE on Iran stated that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in the fall of 2003  36  South Africa developed a small nuclear arsenal in the 1980s but disassembled them in the early 1990s  making it the only country to have fully given up an independently developed nuclear weapons arsenal  Belarus  Kazakhstan  and Ukraine inherited stockpiles of nuclear arms following the break up of the Soviet Union  but relinquished them to the Russian Federation  Countries with access to nuclear weapons through nuclear sharing agreements include Belgium  Germany  Italy  the Netherlands  and Turkey  North Korea has claimed to have developed and tested nuclear devices  Although outside sources have been unable to unequivocally support the state s claims  North Korea has officially been identified to have nuclear weapons   edit  United States politics Due to the indiscriminate impact of WMDs  the fear of a WMD attack has shaped political policies and campaigns  fostered social movements  and has been the central theme of many films  Support for different levels of WMD development and control varies nationally and internationally  Yet understanding of the nature of the threats is not high  in part because of imprecise usage of the term by politicians and the media  Fear of WMD  or of threats diminished by the possession of WMD  has long been used to catalyze public support for various WMD policies  They include mobilization of pro  and anti WMD campaigners alike  and generation of popular political support  The term WMD may be used as a powerful buzzword 37  or to generate a culture of fear  38  It is also used ambiguously  particularly by not distinguishing among the different types of WMD  39  A television commercial called Daisy  promoting Democrat Lyndon Johnson s 1964 presidential candidacy  invoked the fear of a nuclear war and was an element in Johnson s subsequent election  More recently  the threat of potential WMD in Iraq was used by President George W  Bush to generate public support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq  40  41  Broad reference to Iraqi WMD in general was seen as an element of President Bush s arguments  39  As Paul Wolfowitz explained   For bureaucratic reasons  we settled on one issue  weapons of mass destruction  because it was the one reason everyone could agree on   42  To date  however  Coalition forces have found mainly degraded artillery shells  There was almost no dissent on the issue  Molly Ivins wrote   The ONLY  source  to report skeptically on the administration s claims about Iraq s weapons of mass destruction before the war  Knight Ridder and its terrific reporters Warren Strobel and Jonathan Landay   43  On 21 June 2006  then United States Republican Senator Rick Santorum claimed  We have found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq  chemical weapons   According to the Washington Post  he was referring to 500 such shells  that had been buried near the Iranian border  and then long forgotten  by Iraqi troops during their eight year war with Iran  which ended in 1988   That night   intelligence officials reaffirmed that the shells were old and were not the suspected weapons of mass destruction sought in Iraq after the 2003 invasion of Iraq   The shells had been uncovered and reported on in 2004  44  In 2004  Polish troops found nineteen 1980s era rocket warheads  thwarting an attempt by militants to buy them at  5000 each  Some of the rockets contained extremely deteriorated nerve agent  45   edit  Media coverage of WMD In 2004  the Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland  CISSM  released a report 46  examining the media s coverage of WMD issues during three separate periods  nuclear weapons tests by India and Pakistan in May 1998  the US announcement of evidence of a North Korean nuclear weapons program in October 2002  and revelations about Iran s nuclear program in May 2003  The CISSM report notes that poor coverage resulted less from political bias among the media than from tired journalistic conventions  The report s major findings were that  Most media outlets represented WMD as a monolithic menace  failing to adequately distinguish between weapons programs and actual weapons or to address the real differences among chemical  biological  nuclear  and radiological weapons  Most journalists accepted the Bush administration s formulation of the  War on Terror  as a campaign against WMD  in contrast to coverage during the Clinton era  when many journalists made careful distinctions between acts of terrorism and the acquisition and use of WMD  Many stories stenographically reported the incumbent administration s perspective on WMD  giving too little critical examination of the way officials framed the events  issues  threats  and policy options  Too few stories proffered alternative perspectives to official line  a problem exacerbated by the journalistic prioritizing of breaking news stories and the  inverted pyramid  style of storytelling  In a separate study published in 2005  47  a group of researchers assessed the effects reports and retractions in the media had on people s memory regarding the search for WMD in Iraq during the 2003 Iraq War  The study focused on populations in two coalition countries  Australia and USA  and one opposed to the war  Germany   Results showed that US citizens generally did not correct initial misconceptions regarding WMD  even following disconfirmation  Australian and German citizens were more responsive to retractions  Dependence on the initial source of information led to a substantial minority of Americans exhibiting false memory that WMD were indeed discovered  while they were not  This led to three conclusions  The repetition of tentative news stories  even if they are subsequently disconfirmed  can assist in the creation of false memories in a substantial proportion of people  Once information is published  its subsequent correction does not alter people s beliefs unless they are suspicious about the motives underlying the events the news stories are about  When people ignore corrections  they do so irrespective of how certain they are that the corrections occurred  A poll conducted between June and September 2003 asked people whether they thought evidence of WMD had been discovered in Iraq since the war ended  They were also asked which media sources they relied upon  Those who obtained their news primarily from Fox News were three times as likely to believe that evidence of WMD had been discovered in Iraq than those who relied on PBS and NPR for their news  and one third more likely than those who primarily watched CBS  Media source Respondents believing evidence of WMD had been found in Iraq Fox 33  CBS 23  NBC 20  CNN 20  ABC 19  Print media 17  PBS NPR 11  Based on a series of polls taken from June September 2003  48  In 2006 Fox News reported the claims of two Republican lawmakers that WMDs had been found in Iraq  49  based upon unclassified portions of a report by the National Ground Intelligence Center  Quoting from the report Senator Rick Santorum said  Since 2003  coalition forces have recovered approximately 500 weapons munitions which contain degraded mustard or sarin nerve agent   According to David Kay  who appeared before the US House Armed Services Committee to discuss these badly corroded munitions  they were leftovers  many years old  improperly stored or destroyed by the Iraqis  50  Charles Duelfer agreed  stating on NPR s Talk of the Nation   When I was running the ISG   the Iraq Survey Group   we had a couple of them that had been turned in to these IEDs  the improvised explosive devices  But they are local hazards  They are not a major  you know  weapon of mass destruction   51  Later  wikileaks would show that these kind of WMDs continued to be found as the Iraqi occupation continued 52  Many news agencies  including Fox News  reported the conclusions of the CIA that  based upon the investigation of the Iraq Survey Group  WMDs have yet to be found in Iraq  53  54   edit  Public perceptions of WMD Awareness and opinions of WMD have varied during the course of their history  Their threat is a source of unease  security  and pride to different people  The anti WMD movement is embodied most in nuclear disarmament  and led to the formation of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament  In order to increase awareness of all kinds of WMD  in 2004 the nuclear physicist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Joseph Rotblat inspired the creation of The WMD Awareness Programme to provide trustworthy and up to date information on WMD world wide  In 1998 University of New Mexico s Institute for Public Policy released their third report 55  on US perceptions   including the general public  politicians and scientists   of nuclear weapons since the breakup of the Soviet Union  Risks of nuclear conflict  proliferation  and terrorism were seen as substantial  While maintenance of a nuclear US arsenal was considered above average in importance  there was widespread support for a reduction in the stockpile  and very little support for developing and testing new nuclear weapons  Also in 1998  but after the UNM survey was conducted  nuclear weapons became an issue in India s election of March  56  in relation to political tensions with neighboring Pakistan  Prior to the election the Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP  announced it would  declare India a nuclear weapon state  after coming to power  BJP won the elections  and on 14 May  three days after India tested nuclear weapons for the second time  a public opinion poll reported that a majority of Indians favored the country s nuclear build up  On 15 April 2004  the Program on International Policy Attitudes  PIPA  reported 57  that US citizens showed high levels of concern regarding WMD  and that preventing the spread of nuclear weapons should be  a very important US foreign policy goal   accomplished through multilateral arms control rather than the use of military threats  A majority also believed the US should be more forthcoming with its biological research and its Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty commitment of nuclear arms reduction  and incorrectly thought the US was a party to various non proliferation treaties  A Russian opinion poll conducted on 5 August 2005 indicated half the population believes new nuclear powers have the right to possess nuclear weapons  58  39  believes the Russian stockpile should be reduced  though not fully eliminated   edit  WMD in popular culture Weapons of mass destruction and their related impacts have been a mainstay of popular culture since the beginning of the Cold War  as both political commentary and humorous outlet  Main article  Weapons of mass destruction in popular culture  edit  Common hazard symbols Main article  Hazard symbol Symbol Unicode Image Toxic symbol   U 2620 Radioactive symbol   U 2622 Biohazard symbol   U 2623  edit  Radioactive weaponry hazard symbol The international radioactivity symbol  also known as trefoil  first appeared in 1946  at the University of California  Berkeley Radiation Laboratory  At the time  it was rendered as magenta  and was set on a blue background  59  It is drawn with a central circle of radius R  the blades having an internal radius of 1 5R and an external radius of 5R  and separated from each other by 60   60  It is meant to represent a radiating atom  The International Atomic Energy Agency found  however  that the symbol is unintuitive and can be variously interpreted by those uneducated in its meaning  and that its role as a hazard warning was compromised as it did not clearly indicate  danger  to many non Westerners and children who encountered it  As a result of research  a new radiation hazard symbol was developed to be placed near the most dangerous parts of radiation sources featuring a skull  someone running away  and using the color red rather than yellow as the background  61   edit  Biological weaponry hazard symbol Developed by Dow Chemical company in the 1960s for their containment products  62  According to Charles Dullin  an environmental health engineer who contributed to its development  60    We wanted something that was memorable but meaningless  so we could educate people as to what it means     edit  See also Weapons of mass
