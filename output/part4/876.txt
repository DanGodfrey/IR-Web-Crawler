terms Rock music is a genre of popular music that developed during and after the 1960s  particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States  It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll  itself heavily influenced by rhythm and blues and country music  Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as blues and folk  and incorporated influences from jazz  classical and other musical sources  Musically  rock has centred around the electric guitar  usually as part of a rock group with bass guitar and drums  Typically  rock is song based music with a 4 4 beat utilizing a verse chorus form  but the genre has become extremely diverse and common musical characteristics are difficult to define  Like pop music  lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political in emphasis  The dominance of rock by white  male musicians has been seen as one of the key factors shaping the themes explored in rock music  Rock places a higher degree of emphasis on musicianship  live performance  and an ideology of authenticity than pop music  By the late 1960s  a number of distinct rock music sub genres had emerged  including hybrids like blues rock  folk rock  country rock  and jazz rock fusion  many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock influenced by the counter cultural psychedelic scene  New genres that emerged from this scene included progressive rock  which extended the artistic elements  glam rock  which highlighted showmanship and visual style  and the diverse and enduring major sub genre of heavy metal  which emphasized volume  power and speed  In the second half of the 1970s  punk rock both intensified and reacted against some of these trends to produce a raw  energetic form of music characterized by overt political and social critiques  Punk was an influence into the 1980s on the subsequent development of other sub genres  including New Wave  post punk and eventually the alternative rock movement  From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break through into the mainstream in the form of grunge  Britpop  and indie rock  Further fusion sub genres have since emerged  including pop punk  rap rock  and rap metal  as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock s history  including the garage rock post punk and synthpop revivals at the beginning of the new millennium  Rock music has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social movements  leading to major sub cultures including mods and rockers in the UK and the  hippie  counterculture that spread out from San Francisco in the US in the 1960s  Similarly  1970s punk culture spawned the visually distinctive goth and emo subcultures  Inheriting the folk tradition of the protest song  rock music has been associated with political activism as well as changes in social attitudes to race  sex and drug use  and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt against adult consumerism and conformity  Contents 1 Characteristics 2 Background  1950s early 1960s  2 1 Rock and roll 2 2 The  in between years  2 3 Surf music 3 Emergence  mid  to late

bassist  and drummer The sound of rock is traditionally centred around the electric guitar  which emerged in its modern form in the 1950s with the popularization of rock and roll  1  The sound of the electric guitar in rock music is typically supported by the electric bass guitar pioneered in jazz music in the same era  2  and percussion produced from a drum kit that combines drums and cymbals  3  This trio of instruments has often been complemented by the inclusion of others  particularly keyboards such as the piano  Hammond organ and synthesizers  4  A group of musicians performing rock music is termed a rock band or rock group and typically consists of between two and five members  Classically  a rock band takes the form of a quartet whose members cover one or more roles  including vocalist  lead guitarist  rhythm guitarist  bass guitarist  drummer and occasionally that of keyboard player or other instrumentalist  5  Rock music is traditionally built on a foundation of simple unsyncopated rhythms in a 4 4 meter  with a repetitive snare drum back beat on beats two and four  6  Melodies are often derived from older musical modes  including the Dorian and Mixolydian  as well as major and minor modes  Harmonies range from the common triad to parallel fourths and fifths and dissonant harmonic progressions  6  Rock songs from the mid 1960s onwards often used the verse chorus structure derived from blues and folk music  but there has been considerable variation from this model  7  Critics have stressed the eclecticism and stylistic diversity of rock  8  Because of its complex history and tendency to borrow from other musical and cultural forms  it has been argued that  it is impossible to bind rock music to a rigidly delineated musical definition   9  A simple 4 4 drum pattern common in rock music  Play  help info  Unlike many earlier styles of popular music  rock lyrics have dealt with a wide range of themes in addition to romantic love  including sex  rebellion against the establishment  social concerns and life styles  6  These themes were inherited from a variety of sources  including the Tin Pan Alley pop tradition  folk music and rhythm and blues  10  The predominance of white  male and often middle class musicians in rock music has often been noted 11  and rock has been seen as an appropriation of black musical forms for a young  white and largely male audience  12  As a result it has been seen as articulating the concerns of this group in both style and lyrics  13  Since the term rock began to be used in preference to rock and roll from the mid 1960s  it has often been contrasted with pop music  with which it has shared many characteristics  but from which it is often distanced by an emphasis on musicianship  live performance and a focus on serious and progressive themes as part of an ideology of authenticity that is frequently combined with an awareness of the genre s history and development  14  According to Simon Frith  rock was something more than pop  something more than rock and roll  Rock musicians combined an emphasis on skill and technique with the romantic concept of art as artistic expression  original and sincere   14  In the new millennium the term rock has sometimes been used as a blanket term including forms such as pop music  reggae music  soul music  and even hip hop  with which it has been influenced but often contrasted through much of its history  15   edit  Background  1950s early 1960s   edit  Rock and roll Main article  Rock and roll See also  Origins of rock and roll and Rockabilly The foundations of rock music are in rock and roll  which originated in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s  and quickly spread to much of the rest of the world  Its immediate origins lay in a mixing together of various black musical genres of the time  including rhythm and blues and gospel music  with country and western  16  In 1951  Cleveland  Ohio disc jockey Alan Freed began playing rhythm and blues music for a multi racial audience  and is credited with first using the phrase  rock and roll  to describe the music  17  Elvis Presley in a promotion shot for Jailhouse Rock in 1957 Debate surrounds which record should be considered the first rock and roll record  One contender is  Rocket 88  by Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats  in fact  Ike Turner and his band The Kings of Rhythm   recorded by Sam Phillips for Sun Records in 1951  18  Four years later  Bill Haley s  Rock Around the Clock   1955  became the first rock and roll song to top Billboard magazine s main sales and airplay charts  and opened the door worldwide for this new wave of popular culture  19  It has been argued that  That s All Right  Mama    1954   Elvis Presley s first single for Sun Records in Memphis  was the first rock and roll record  20  but  at the same time  Big Joe Turner s  Shake  Rattle  amp  Roll   later covered by Haley  was already at the top of the Billboard R amp B charts  Other artists with early rock and roll hits included Chuck Berry  Bo Diddley  Fats Domino  Little Richard  Jerry Lee Lewis  and Gene Vincent  18  Soon rock and roll was the major force in American record sales and crooners  such as Eddie Fisher  Perry Como  and Patti Page  who had dominated the previous decade of popular music  found their access to the pop charts significantly curtailed  21  Rock and roll has been seen as leading to a number of distinct sub genres  including rockabilly  combining rock and roll with  hillbilly  country music  which was usually played and recorded in the mid 1950s by white singers such as Carl Perkins  Jerry Lee Lewis  Buddy Holly and with the greatest commercial success  Elvis Presley  22  In contrast doo wop placed an emphasis on multi part vocal harmonies and meaningless backing lyrics  from which the genre later gained its name   which were usually supported with light instrumentation and had its origins in 1930s and  40s African American vocal groups  23  Acts like The Crows  The Penguins  The El Dorados and The Turbans all scored major hits  and groups like The Platters  with songs including  The Great Pretender   1955   and The Coasters with humorous songs like  Yakety Yak   1958   ranked among the most successful rock and roll acts of the period  24  The era also saw the growth in popularity of the electric guitar  and the development of a specifically rock and roll style of playing through such exponents as Chuck Berry  Link Wray  and Scotty Moore  25  In the United Kingdom  the trad jazz and folk movements brought visiting blues music artists to Britain  26 Lonnie Donegan s 1955 hit  Rock Island Line  was a major influence and helped to develop the trend of skiffle music groups throughout the country  many of which  including John Lennon s The Quarrymen  moved on to play rock and roll  27  Commentators have traditionally perceived a decline of rock and roll in the late 1950s and early 1960s  By 1959  the death of Buddy Holly  The Big Bopper and Richie Valens in a plane crash  the departure of Elvis for the army  the retirement of Little Richard to become a preacher  prosecutions of Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry and the breaking of the payola scandal  which implicated major figures  including Alan Freed  in bribery and corruption in promoting individual acts or songs   gave a sense that the initial rock and roll era had come to an end  18   edit  The  in between years  Main article  Rock and roll See also  Doo Wop  British rock and roll  and Soul music Chubby Checker in 2005 The period of the later 1950s and early 1960s  between the end of the initial period of innovation and what became known in the USA as the  British Invasion   has traditionally been seen as an era of hiatus for rock and roll  More recently some authors have emphasised important innovations and trends in this period without which future developments would not have been possible  28  29  While early rock and roll  particularly through the advent of rockabilly  saw the greatest commercial success for male and white performers  in this era the genre was dominated by black and female artists  Rock and roll had not disappeared at the end of the 1950s and some of its energy can be seen in the Twist dance craze of the early  60s  mainly benefiting the career of Chubby Checker  29  Having died down in the late 1950s  doo wop enjoyed a revival in the same period  with hits for acts like The Marcels  The Capris  Maurice Williams and Shep and the Limelights  24  The rise of girl groups like The Chantels  The Shirelles and The Crystals placed an emphasis on harmonies and polished production that was in contrast to earlier rock and roll  30  Some of the most significant girl group hits were products of the Brill Building Sound  named after the block in New York where many songwriters were based  which included the number 1 hit for the Shirelles  Will You Love Me Tomorrow  in 1960  penned by the partnership of Gerry Goffin and Carole King  31  Cliff Richard had the first British rock and roll hit with  Move It   effectively ushering in the sound of British rock  32  At the start of the 1960s  his backing group The Shadows was the most successful group recording instrumentals  33  While rock  n  roll was fading into lightweight pop and ballads  British rock groups at clubs and local dances  heavily influenced by blues rock pioneers like Alexis Korner  were starting to play with an intensity and drive seldom found in white American acts  34  Also significant was the advent of soul music as a major commercial force  Developing out of rhythm and blues with a re injection of gospel music and pop  led by pioneers like Ray Charles and Sam Cooke from the mid 1950s  by the early  60s figures like Marvin Gaye  James Brown  Aretha Franklin  Curtis Mayfield and Stevie Wonder were dominating the R amp B charts and breaking through into the main pop charts  helping to accelerate their desegregation  while Motown and Stax Volt Records were becoming major forces in the record industry  35  All of these elements  including the close harmonies of doo wop and girl groups  the carefully crafted song writing of the Brill Building Sound and the polished production values of soul  have been seen as influencing the Merseybeat sound  particularly the early work of The Beatles  and through them the form of later rock music  36  Some historians of music have also pointed to important and innovative technical developments that built on rock and roll in this period  including the electronic treatment of sound by such innovators as Joe Meek  and the elaborate production methods of the Wall of Sound pursued by Phil Spector  29   edit  Surf music Main article  Surf music The instrumental rock and roll pioneered by performers such as Duane Eddy  Link Wray  and The Ventures was developed by Dick Dale who added distinctive  wet  reverb  rapid alternate picking  as well as Middle Eastern and Mexican influences  producing the regional hit  Let s Go Trippin   in 1961 and launching the surf music craze  Like Dale and his Del Tones  most early surf bands were formed in Southern California  including the Bel Airs  the Challengers  and Eddie  amp  the Showmen  37 The Chantays scored a top ten national hit with  Pipeline  in 1963 and probably the best known surf tune was 1963 s  Wipe Out   by the Surfaris  which hit number 2 and number 10 on the Billboard charts in 1965  38  The Beach Boys performing in 1964 The growing popularity of the genre led groups from other areas to try their hand  These included The Astronauts  from Boulder  Colorado  The Trashmen  from Minneapolis  Minnesota  who had a number 4 hit with  Surfin Bird  in 1964 and The Rivieras from South Bend  Indiana  who reached number 5 in 1964 with  California Sun   39 The Atlantics  from Sydney  Australia  made a significant contribution to the genre  with their hit  Bombora   1963   39  European instrumental bands around this time generally focused more on the more rock and roll style played by The Shadows  but The Dakotas  who were the British backing band for Merseybeat singer Billy J  Kramer  gained some attention as surf musicians with  Cruel Sea   1963   which was later covered by American instrumental surf bands  including The Ventures  40  Surf music achieved its greatest commercial success as vocal music  particularly the work of the Beach Boys  formed in 1961 in Southern California  Their early albums included both instrumental surf rock  among them covers of music by Dick Dale  and vocal songs  drawing on rock and roll and doo wop and the close harmonies of vocal pop acts like the Four Freshmen  39  Their first chart hit   Surfin   in 1962 reached the Billboard top 100 and helped make the surf music craze a national phenomenon  41  From 1963 the group began to leave surfing behind as subject matter as Brian Wilson became their major composer and producer  moving on to the more general themes of male adolescence including cars and girls in songs like  Fun  Fun  Fun   1964  and  California Girls   1965   41  Other vocal surf acts followed  including one hit wonders like Ronny  amp  the Daytonas with  G  T  O    1964  and Rip Chords with  Hey Little Cobra   which both reached the top ten  but the only other act to achieve sustained success with the formula were Jan  amp  Dean  who had a number 1 hit with  Surf City   co written with Brian Wilson  in 1963  39  The surf music craze and the careers of almost all surf acts was effectively ended by the arrival of the British Invasion from 1964  39  Only the Beach Boys were able to sustain a creative career into the mid 1960s  producing a string of hit singles and albums  including the highly regarded Pet Sounds in 1966  which made them  arguably  the only American rock or pop act that could rival The Beatles  41   edit  Emergence  mid  to late 1960s   edit  The British Invasion Main article  British Invasion See also  Beat music and British rhythm and blues The Beatles arriving in New York in January 1964 at the beginning of the British Invasion By the end of 1962  what would become the British rock scene had started with beat groups like The Beatles  Gerry  amp  The Pacemakers and The Searchers from Liverpool and Freddie and the Dreamers  Herman s Hermits and The Hollies from Manchester  They drew on a wide range of American influences including soul  rhythm and blues and surf music  42  initially reinterpreting standard American tunes and playing for dancers  Bands like The Animals from Newcastle and Them from Belfast  43  and particularly those from London like The Rolling Stones and The Yardbirds  were much more directly influenced by rhythm and blues and later blues music  44  Soon these groups were composing their own material  combining US forms of music and infusing it with a high energy beat  Beat bands tended towards  bouncy  irresistible melodies   while early British rhythm and blues acts tended towards less sexually innocent  more aggressive songs  often adopting an anti establishment stance  There was  however  particularly in the early stages  considerable musical crossover between the two tendencies  45  By 1963  led by the Beatles  beat groups had begun to achieve national success in Britain  soon to be followed into the charts by the more rhythm and blues focused acts  46  In 1964 the Beatles achieved a breakthrough to mainstream popularity in the United States   I Want to Hold Your Hand  was the band s first number 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100  spending 7 weeks at the top and a total of 15 weeks on the chart  47  48  Their first appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show on 9 February  drawing an estimated 73 million viewers  at the time a record for an American television program  often is considered a milestone in American pop culture  The Beatles went on to become the biggest selling rock band of all time and they were followed into the US charts by numerous British bands  45  During the next two years British acts dominated their own and the US charts with Peter and Gordon  The Animals  Manfred Mann  Petula Clark  Freddie and the Dreamers  Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders  Herman s Hermits  The Rolling Stones  The Troggs  and Donovan all having one or more number 1 singles  47  Other major acts that were part of the invasion included The Kinks and The Dave Clark Five  49  50  The British Invasion helped internationalize the production of rock and roll  opening the door for subsequent British  and Irish  performers to achieve international success  51  In America it arguably spelled the end of instrumental surf music  vocal girl groups and  for a time  the teen idols  that had dominated the American charts in the late 1950s and  60s  52  It dented the careers of established R amp B acts like Fats Domino and Chubby Checker and even temporarily derailed the chart success of surviving rock and roll acts  including Elvis  53  The British Invasion also played a major part in the rise of a distinct genre of rock music  and cemented the primacy of the rock group  based on guitars and drums and producing their own material as singer songwriters  23   edit  Garage rock Main article  Garage rock Garage rock was a form of amateurish rock music  particularly prevalent in North America in the mid 1960s and so called because of the perception that it was rehearsed in a suburban family garage  54  55  Garage rock songs revolved around the traumas of high school life  with songs about  lying girls  being particularly common  56  The lyrics and delivery were more aggressive than was common at the time  often with growled or shouted vocals that dissolved into incoherent screaming  54  They ranged from crude one chord music  like the Seeds  to near studio musician quality  including the Knickerbockers  the Remains  and the Fifth Estate   There were also regional variations in many parts of the country with flourishing scenes particularly in California and Texas  56  The Pacific Northwest states of Washington and Oregon had perhaps the most defined regional sound  57  The D Men  later The Fifth Estate  in 1964 The style had been evolving from regional scenes as early as 1958   Tall Cool One   1959  by The Wailers and  Louie Louie  by The Kingsmen  1963  are mainstream examples of the genre in its formative stages  58  By 1963  garage band singles were creeping into the national charts in greater numbers  including Paul Revere and the Raiders  Boise   59 the Trashmen  Minneapolis  60  and the Rivieras  South Bend  Indiana   61  Other influential garage bands  such as the Sonics  Tacoma  Washington   never reached the Billboard Hot 100  62  In this early period many bands were heavily influenced by surf rock and there was a cross pollination between garage rock and frat rock  sometimes viewed as merely a sub genre of garage rock  63  The British Invasion of 1964 66 greatly influenced garage bands  providing them with a national audience  leading many  often surf or hot rod groups  to adopt a British Invasion lilt  and encouraging many more groups to form  56  Thousands of garage bands were extant in the USA and Canada during the era and hundreds produced regional hits  56  Examples include   The Witch  by Tacoma s The Sonics  1965    Where You Gonna Go  by Detroit s Unrelated Segments  1967    Girl I Got News for You  by Miami s Birdwatchers  1966  and  1 2 5  by Montreal s The Haunted  Despite scores of bands being signed to major or large regional labels  most were commercial failures  It is generally agreed that garage rock peaked both commercially and artistically around 1966  56  By 1968 the style largely disappeared from the national charts and at the local level as amateur musicians faced college  work or the draft  56  New styles had evolved to replace garage rock  including blues rock  progressive rock and country rock   56  In Detroit garage rock stayed alive until the early  70s  with bands like the MC5 and The Stooges  who employed a much more aggressive style  These bands began to be labelled punk rock and are now often seen as proto punk or proto hard rock  64   edit  Pop rock Main article  Pop rock See also  Pop music and Power pop The Everly Brothers in 2006 The term pop has been used since the early 20th century to refer to popular music in general  but from the mid 1950s it began to be used for a distinct genre  aimed at a youth market  often characterized as a softer alternative to rock and roll  65  66  In the aftermath of the British Invasion  from about 1967  it was increasingly used in opposition to the term rock music  to describe a form that was more commercial  ephemeral and accessible  14  In contrast rock music was seen as focusing on extended works  particularly albums  was often associated with particular sub cultures  like the counter culture   placed an emphasis on artistic values and  authenticity   stressed live performance and instrumental or vocal virtuosity and was often seen as encapsulating progressive developments rather than simply reflecting existing trends  14  65  66  67  Nevertheless much pop and rock music has been very similar in sound  instrumentation and even lyrical content  The terms  pop rock  and  power pop  have been used to describe more commercially successful music that uses elements from  or the form of  rock music  68  Pop rock has been defined as an  upbeat variety of rock music represented by artists such as Elton John  Paul McCartney  The Everly Brothers  Rod Stewart  Chicago  and Peter Frampton   69  In contrast  self published music reviewer George Starostin defines it as a subgenre of pop music that uses catchy pop songs that are mostly guitar based  Starostin argues that most of what is traditionally called  power pop  falls into the pop rock subgenre and that the lyrical content of pop rock is  normally secondary to the music   70  The term power pop was coined by Pete Townshend of The Who in 1966  but not much used until it was applied to bands like Badfinger in the 1970s  who proved some of the most commercially successful of the period  71  Throughout its history there have been rock acts that have used elements of pop  and pop artists who have used rock music as a basis for their work  or striven for rock  authenticity    edit  Blues rock Main article  Blues rock See also  British blues Although the first impact of the British Invasion on American popular music was through beat and R amp B based acts  the impetus was soon taken up by a second wave of bands that drew their inspiration more directly from American blues  including the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds  72  British blues musicians of the late 1950s and early  60s had been inspired by the acoustic playing of figures such as Lead Belly  who was a major influence on the Skiffle craze  and Robert Johnson  73  Increasingly they adopted a loud amplified sound  often centred around the electric guitar  based on the Chicago blues  particularly after the tour of Britain by Muddy Waters in 1958  which prompted Cyril Davies and guitarist Alexis Korner to form the band Blues Incorporated  74  The band involved and inspired many of the figures of the subsequent British blues boom  including members of the Rolling Stones and Cream  combining blues standards and forms with rock instrumentation and emphasis  34  Eric Clapton performing in Barcelona in 1974 The other key focus for British blues was around John Mayall who formed the Bluesbreakers  whose members included Eric Clapton  after his departure from The Yardbirds  and later Peter Green  Particularly significant was the release of Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton  Beano  album  1966   considered one of the seminal British blues recordings and the sound of which was much emulated in both Britain and the United States  75  Eric Clapton went on to form supergroups Cream  Blind Faith and Derek and the Dominos  followed by an extensive solo career that helped bring blues rock into the mainstream  74  Green  along with the Bluesbreaker s rhythm section Mick Fleetwood and John McVie  formed Peter Green s Fleetwood Mac  who enjoyed some of the greatest commercial success in the genre  74  In the late  60s Jeff Beck  also an alumnus of the Yardbirds  moved blues rock in the direction of heavy rock with his band  The Jeff Beck Group  74  The last Yardbirds guitarist was Jimmy Page  who went on to form The New Yardbirds which rapidly became Led Zeppelin  Many of the songs on their first three albums  and occasionally later in their careers  were expansions on traditional blues songs  74  In America blues rock had been pioneered in the early 1960s by guitarist Lonnie Mack  76  but the genre began to take off in the mid  60s as acts developed a sound similar to British blues musicians  Key acts included Paul Butterfield  whose band acted like Mayall s Bluesbreakers in Britain as a starting point for many successful musicians   Canned Heat  the early Jefferson Airplane  Janis Joplin  Johnny Winter  The J  Geils Band and Jimi Hendrix with his power trios  The Jimi Hendrix Experience and Band of Gypsys  whose guitar virtuosity and showmanship would be among the most emulated of the decade  74  Blues rock bands from the southern states  like Allman Brothers Band  Lynyrd Skynyrd  and ZZ Top  incorporated country elements into their style to produce distinctive Southern rock  77  Early blues rock bands often emulated jazz  playing long  involved improvisations  which would later be a major element of progressive rock  From about 1967 bands like Cream and The Jimi Hendrix Experience had begun to move away from purely blues based music into psychedelia  78  By the 1970s blues rock had become heavier and more riff based  exemplified by the work of Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple  and the lines between blues rock and hard rock  were barely visible   78  as bands began recording rock style albums  78  The genre was continued in the 1970s by figures such as George Thorogood and Pat Travers  74  but  particularly on the British scene  except perhaps for the advent of groups such as Status Quo and Foghat who moved towards a form of high energy and repetitive boogie rock   bands became focused on heavy metal innovation  and blues rock began to slip out of the mainstream  79   edit  Folk rock Main article  Folk rock See also  Electric folk Joan Baez and Bob Dylan in 1963 By the 1960s  the scene that had developed out of the American folk music revival had grown to a major movement  utilising traditional music and new compositions in a traditional style  usually on acoustic instruments  80  In America the genre was pioneered by figures such as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger and often identified with progressive or labor politics  80  In the early sixties figures such as Joan Baez and Bob Dylan had come to the fore in this movement as singer songwriters  81  Dylan had begun to reach a mainstream audience with hits including  Blowin  in the Wind   1963  and  Masters of War   1963   which brought  protest songs  to a wider public  82  but  although beginning to influence each other  rock and folk music had remained largely separate genres  often with mutually exclusive audiences  83  Early attempts to combine elements of folk and rock included the Animals  House of the Rising Sun   1964   which was the first commercially successful folk song to be recorded with rock and roll instrumentation 84  and the Beatles  I m a Loser   1964   arguably the first Beatles song to be influenced directly by Dylan  85  The folk rock movement is usually thought to have taken off with The Byrds  recording of Dylan s  Mr  Tambourine Man  which topped the charts in 1965  83  With members who had been part of the cafe based folk scene in Los Angeles  the Byrds adopted rock instrumentation  including drums and 12 string Rickenbacker guitars  which became a major element in the sound of the genre  83  Later that year Dylan adopted electric instruments  much to the outrage of many folk purists  with his  Like a Rolling Stone  becoming a US hit single  83  Folk rock particularly took off in California  where it led acts like The Mamas  amp  the Papas and Crosby  Stills and Nash to move to electric instrumentation  and in New York  where it spawned performers including The Lovin  Spoonful and Simon and Garfunkel  with the latter s acoustic  The Sounds of Silence   1965  being remixed with rock instruments to be the first of many hits  83  These acts directly influenced British performers like Donovan and Fairport Convention  83  In 1969 Fairport Convention abandoned their mixture of American covers and Dylan influenced songs to play traditional English folk music on electric instruments  86  This electric folk was taken up by bands including Pentangle  Steeleye Span and The Albion Band  which turn prompted Irish groups like Horslips and Scottish acts like the JSD Band  Spencer s Feat and later Five Hand Reel  to use their traditional music to create a brand of Celtic rock in the early 1970s  87  Folk rock reached its peak of commercial popularity in the period 1967 68  before many acts moved off in a variety of directions  including Dylan and the Byrds  who began to develop country rock  88  However  the hybridization of folk and rock has been seen as having a major influence on the development of rock music  bringing in elements of psychedelia  and helping to develop the ideas of the singer songwriter  the protest song and concepts of  authenticity   83  89   edit  Psychedelic

term in their 1964 recording of  Hesitation Blues   90  The first group to advertise themselves as psychedelic rock were the 13th Floor Elevators from Texas  at the end of 1965  producing an album that made their direction clear  with The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators the following year  90  The Beatles introduced many of the major elements of the psychedelic sound to audiences in this period  with  I Feel Fine  using guitar feedback  in late 1965 the Rubber Soul album included the use of a sitar on  Norwegian Wood  and they employed backmasking on their 1966 single B side  Rain  and other tracks that appeared on their Revolver album later that year  91  Psychedelic rock particularly took off in California s emerging music scene as groups followed the Byrds from folk to folk rock from 1965  91  The psychedelic life style had already developed in San Francisco and particularly prominent products of the scene were The Grateful Dead  Country Joe and the Fish  The Great Society and Jefferson Airplane  91  The Byrds rapidly progressed from purely folk rock in 1966 with their single  Eight Miles High   widely taken to be a reference to drug use  In Britain arguably the most influential band in the genre were The Yardbirds  91  who  with Jeff Beck as their guitarist  increasingly moved into psychedelic territory  adding up tempo improvised  rave ups   Gregorian chant and world music influences to songs including  Still I m Sad   1965  and  Over Under Sideways Down   1966   92  From 1966 the UK underground scene based in North London  supported new acts including Pink Floyd  Traffic and Soft Machine  93  The same year saw Donovan s folk influenced hit album Sunshine Superman  considered one of the first psychedelic pop records  as well as the d buts of blues rock bands Cream and The Jimi Hendrix Experience  whose extended guitar heavy jams became a key feature of psychedelia  91  Psychedelic rock reached its apogee in the last years of the decade  1967 saw the Beatles release their definitive psychedelic statement in Sgt  Pepper s Lonely Hearts Club Band  including the controversial track  Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds  and the Rolling Stones responded later that year with Their Satanic Majesties Request  91  Pink Floyd produced what is usually seen as their best psychedelic work The Piper at the Gates of Dawn  91  In America the Summer of Love was prefaced by the Human Be In event and reached its peak at the Monterey Pop Festival  the latter helping to make major American stars of Jimi Hendrix and The Who  whose single  I Can See for Miles  delved into psychedelic territory  94  Key recordings included Jefferson Airplane s Surrealistic Pillow and The Doors  Strange Days  95  These trends climaxed in the 1969 Woodstock festival  which saw performances by most of the major psychedelic acts  but by the end of the decade psychedelic rock was in retreat  Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys  Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones  Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac and Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd were early  acid casualties   the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Cream broke up before the end of the decade and many surviving acts moved away from psychedelia into more back to basics  roots rock   the wider experimentation of progressive rock  or riff laden heavy rock  91   edit  Progression  late 1960s to mid 1970s   edit  Roots rock Main article  Roots rock See also  Country rock and Southern rock Roots rock is the term now used to describe a move away from what some saw as the excesses of the psychedelic scene  to a more basic form of rock and roll that incorporated its original influences  particularly country and folk music  leading to the creation of country rock and Southern rock  96  In 1966 Bob Dylan went to Nashville to record the album Blonde on Blonde  97  This  and subsequent more clearly country influenced albums  have been seen as creating the genre of country folk  a route pursued by a number of  largely acoustic  folk musicians  97  Other acts that followed the back to basics trend were the Canadian group The Band and the California based Creedence Clearwater Revival  both of which mixed basic rock and roll with folk  country and blues  to be among the most successful and influential bands of the late 1960s  98  The same movement saw the beginning of the recording careers of Californian solo artists like Ry Cooder  Bonnie Raitt and Lowell George  99  and influenced the work of established performers such as the Rolling Stones  Beggar s Banquet  1968  and the Beatles  Let It Be  1970   91  The Eagles during their 2008 2009 Long Road out of Eden Tour In 1968 Gram Parsons recorded Safe at Home with the International Submarine Band  arguably the first true country rock album  100  Later that year he joined the Byrds for Sweetheart of the Rodeo  1968   generally considered one of the most influential recordings in the genre  100  The Byrds continued in the same vein  but Parsons left to be joined by another ex Byrds member Chris Hillman in forming The Flying Burrito Brothers who helped establish the respectability and parameters of the genre  before Parsons departed to pursue a solo career  100  Country rock was particularly popular in the Californian music scene  where it was adopted by bands including Hearts and Flowers  Poco and New Riders of the Purple Sage  100  the Beau Brummels 100  and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band  101  Some performers also enjoyed a renaissance by adopting country sounds  including  the Everly Brothers  one time teen idol Rick Nelson who became the frontman for the Stone Canyon Band  former Monkee Mike Nesmith who formed the First National Band  and Neil Young  100 The Dillards were  unusually  a country act  who moved towards rock music  100  The greatest commercial success for country rock came in the 1970s  with artist including the Doobie Brothers  Emmylou Harris  Linda Ronstadt and the Eagles  made up of members of the Burritos  Poco and Stone Canyon Band   who emerged as one of the most successful rock acts of all time  producing albums that included Hotel California  1976   102  The founders of Southern rock are usually thought to be the Allman Brothers Band  who developed a distinctive sound  largely derived from blues rock  but incorporating elements of boogie  soul  and country in the early 1970s  77  The most successful act to follow them were Lynyrd Skynyrd  who helped establish the  Good ol  boy  image of the sub genre and the general shape of 1970s guitar rock  77  Their successors included the fusion progressive instrumentalists Dixie Dregs  the more country influenced Outlaws  jazz leaning Wet Willie and  incorporating elements of R amp B and gospel  the Ozark Mountain Daredevils  77  After the loss of original members of the Allmans and Lynyrd Skynyrd  the genre began to fade in popularity in the late 1970s  but was sustained the 1980s with acts like  38 Special  Molly Hatchet and The Marshall Tucker Band  77   edit  Progressive rock Main article  Progressive rock See also  Art rock  Electronic rock  and Kraut rock Progressive rock  a term sometimes used interchangeably with art

Stones and The Beach Boys  had pioneered the inclusion of harpsichords  wind and string sections on their recordings to produce a form of Baroque rock and can be heard in singles like Procol Harum s  A Whiter Shade of Pale   1967   with its Bach inspired introduction  104 The Moody Blues used a full orchestra on their album Days of Future Passed  1967  and subsequently created orchestral sounds

jazz and symphonic music  is often taken as the key recording in progressive rock  helping the widespread adoption of the genre in the early 1970s among existing blues rock and psychedelic bands  as well as newly formed acts  103  The vibrant Canterbury scene saw acts following Soft Machine from psychedelia  through jazz influences  toward more expansive hard rock  including Caravan  Hatfield and the North  Gong  and National Health  108  Greater commercial success was enjoyed by Pink Floyd  who also moved away from psychedelia after the departure of Syd Barrett in 1968  with Dark Side of the Moon  1973   seen as a masterpiece of the genre  becoming one of the best selling albums of all time  109  There was an emphasis on instrumental virtuosity  with Yes showcasing the skills of both guitarist Steve Howe and keyboard player Rick Wakeman  while Emerson  Lake  amp  Palmer were a supergroup who produced some of the genre s most technically demanding work  103 Jethro Tull and Genesis

octave voice of Annie Haslam  111  Most British bands depended on a relatively small cult following  but a handful  including Pink Floyd  Genesis and Jethro Tull  managed to produce top ten singles at home and break the American market  112  The American brand of prog rock varied from the eclectic and innovative Frank Zappa  Captain Beefheart and Blood  Sweat and Tears  113  to more pop rock orientated bands like Boston  Foreigner  Kansas  Journey and Styx  103  These  beside British bands Supertramp and ELO  all demonstrated a prog rock influence and while ranking among the most

replaced by more economical rock festivals as major live venues in the 1990s  114  The instrumental strand of the genre resulted in albums like Mike Oldfield s Tubular Bells  1973   the first record  and worldwide hit  for the Virgin Records label  which became a mainstay of the genre  103  Instrumental rock was particularly significant in continental Europe  allowing bands like Kraftwerk  Tangerine Dream  Can and Faust to circumvent the language barrier  115  Their synthesiser heavy  Kraut rock   along with the work of Brian Eno  for a time the keyboard player with Roxy Music   would be a major influence on subsequent synth rock  103  With the advent of punk rock and technological changes in the late 1970s  progressive rock was increasingly dismissed as pretentious and overblown  116  117  Many bands broke up  but some  including Genesis  ELP  Yes  and Pink Floyd  regularly scored top ten albums with successful accompanying worldwide tours  64  Some bands which emerged in the aftermath of punk  such as Siouxsie and the Banshees  Ultravox and Simple Minds  showed the influence of prog  as well as their more usually recognized punk influences  118   edit  Jazz rock Main article  Jazz rock Jaco Pastorius of Weather Report in 1980 In the late 1960s jazz rock emerged as a distinct sub genre out of the blues rock  psychedelic and progressive rock scenes  mixing the power of rock with the musical complexity and improvisational elements of jazz  Many early US rock and roll musicians had begun in jazz and carried some of these elements into the new music  In Britain the sub genre of blues rock  and many of its leading figures  like Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce of Cream  had emerged from the British jazz scene  Often highlighted as the first true jazz rock recording is the only album by the relatively obscure New York based The Free Spirits with Out of Sight and Sound  1966   The first group of bands to self consciously use the label were R amp B oriented white rock bands that made use of jazzy horn sections  like Electric Flag  Blood  Sweat and Tears and Chicago  to become some of the most commercially successful acts of the later 1960s and early 1970s  119  British acts to emerge in the same period from the blues scene  to make use of the tonal and improvisational aspects of jazz  included Nucleus 120  and the Graham Bond and John Mayall spin off Colosseum  From the psychedelic rock and the Canterbury scenes came Soft Machine  who  it has been suggested  produced one of the artistically successfully fusions of the two genres  Perhaps the most critically acclaimed fusion came from the jazz side of the equation  with Miles Davis  particularly influenced by the work of Hendrix  incorporating rock instrumentation into his sound for the album Bitches Brew  1970   It was a major influence on subsequent rock influenced jazz artists  including Herbie Hancock  Chick Corea and Weather Report  119  The genre began to fade in the late 1970s  as a mellower form of fusion began to take its audience  121  but acts like Steely Dan  121  Frank Zappa and Joni Mitchell recorded significant jazz influenced albums in this period  and it has continued to be a major influence on rock music  119   edit  Glam rock Main article  Glam rock David Bowie during the Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders Tour in 1972 Glam rock emerged out of the English psychedelic and art rock scenes of the late 1960s and can be seen as both an extension of and reaction against those trends  122  Musically diverse  varying between the simple rock and roll revivalism of figures like Alvin Stardust to the complex art rock of Roxy Music  and can be seen as much as a fashion as a musical sub genre  122  Visually it was a mesh of various styles  ranging from 1930s Hollywood glamor  through 1950s pin up sex appeal  pre war Cabaret theatrics  Victorian literary and symbolist styles  science fiction  to ancient and occult mysticism and mythology  manifesting itself in outrageous clothes  makeup  hairstyles  and platform soled boots  123  Glam is most noted for its sexual and gender ambiguity and representations of androgyny  beside extensive use of theatrics  124  It was prefigured by the showmanship and gender identity manipulation of American acts such as The Cockettes and Alice Cooper  125  The origins of glam rock are associated with Marc Bolan  who had renamed his folk duo to T  Rex and taken up electric instruments by the end of the 1960s  Often cited as the moment of inception is his appearance on the UK TV programme Top of the Pops in December 1970 wearing glitter  to perform what would be his first number 1 single  Ride a White Swan   126  From 1971  already a minor star  David Bowie developed his Ziggy Stardust persona  incorporating elements of professional make up  mime and performance into his act  127  These performers were soon followed in the style by acts including Roxy Music  Sweet  Slade  Mott the Hoople  Mud and Alvin Stardust  127  While highly successful in the single charts in the UK  very few of these musicians were able to make a serious impact in the United States  Bowie was the major exception becoming an international superstar and prompting the adoption of glam styles among acts like Lou Reed  Iggy Pop  New York Dolls and Jobriath  often known as  glitter rock  and with a darker lyrical content than their British counterparts  128  In the UK the term glitter rock was most often used to refer to the extreme version of glam pursued by Gary Glitter and his support musicians the Glitter Band  who between them achieved eighteen top ten singles in the UK between 1972 and 1976  129  A second wave of glam rock acts  including Suzi Quatro  Roy Wood s Wizzard and Sparks  dominated the British single charts from about 1974 to 1976  127  Existing acts  some not usually considered central to the genre  also adopted glam styles  including Rod Stewart  Elton John  Queen and  for a time  even the Rolling Stones  127  It was also a direct influence on acts that rose to prominence later  including Kiss and Adam Ant  and less directly on the formation of gothic rock and glam metal as well as on punk rock  which helped end the fashion for glam from about 1976  128  Glam has since enjoyed sporadic modest revivals through bands such as Chainsaw Kittens  The Darkness 130  and in R n  B crossover

it became common to divide mainstream rock music into soft and hard rock  Soft rock was often derived from folk rock  using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies  132  Major artists included Carole King  Cat Stevens and James Taylor  132  It reached its commercial peak in the mid  to late  70s with acts like Billy Joel  America and the reformed Fleetwood Mac  whose Rumours  1977  was the best selling album of the decade  133  In contrast  hard rock was more often derived from blues rock and was played louder and with more intensity  134  It often emphasised the electric guitar  both as a rhythm instrument using simple repetitive riffs and as a solo lead instrument  and was more likely to be used with distortion and other effects  134  Key acts included British Invasion bands like The Who and The Kinks  as well as psychedelic era performers like Cream  Jimi Hendrix and The Jeff Beck Group  134  Hard rock influenced bands that enjoyed international success in the later 1970s included Queen  135 Thin Lizzy  136 Aerosmith and AC DC  134  From the late 1960s the term heavy metal began to be used to describe some hard rock played with even more volume and intensity  first as an adjective and by the early 1970s as a noun  137  The term was first used in music in Steppenwolf s  Born to Be Wild   1967  and began to be associated with pioneer bands like Boston s Blue Cheer and Michigan s Grand Funk Railroad  138  By 1970 three key British bands had developed the characteristic sounds and styles which would help shape the sub genre  Led Zeppelin added elements of fantasy to their riff laden blues rock  Deep Purple brought in symphonic and medieval interests from their progressive rock phrase and Black Sabbath introduced facets of the gothic and modal harmony  helping to produce a  darker  sound  139  These elements were taken up by a  second generation  of heavy metal bands into the late 1970s  including  Judas Priest  UFO  Mot rhead and Rainbow from Britain  Kiss  Ted Nugent  and Blue  yster Cult from the US  Rush from Canada and Scorpions from Germany  all marking the expansion in popularity of the sub genre  139  Despite

demonic  141  However  Christian rock began to develop in the late 1960s  particularly out of the Jesus movement beginning in Southern California  and emerged as a sub genre in the 1970s with artists like Larry Norman  usually seen as the first major  star  of Christian rock  142  The genre has been particularly popular in the United States  143  Many Christian rock performers have ties to the contemporary Christian music scene  while other bands and artists are closely linked to independent music  Since the 1980s Christian rock performers have gained mainstream success  including figures such as the American gospel to pop crossover artist Amy Grant and the British singer Cliff Richard  144  While these artists were largely acceptable in Christian communities the adoption of heavy rock and glam metal styles by bands like Petra and Stryper  who achieved considerable mainstream success in the 1980s  was more controversial  145  146  From the 1990s there were increasing numbers of acts who attempted to avoid the Christian band label  preferring to be seen as groups who were also Christians  including P O D and Collective Soul  147   edit  Punk and its aftermath  mid 1970s to the

music  typically with short songs  stripped down instrumentation  and often political  anti establishment lyrics  Punk embraces a DIY  do it yourself  ethic  with many bands self producing their recordings and distributing them through informal channels  149  By late 1976  acts such as the Ramones and Patti Smith  in New York City  and the Sex Pistols and The Clash  in London  were recognized as the vanguard of a new musical movement  148  The following year saw punk rock spreading around the world  Punk quickly  though briefly  became a major cultural phenomenon in the United Kingdom  For the most part  punk took root in local scenes that tended to reject association with the mainstream  An associated punk subculture emerged  expressing youthful rebellion and characterized by distinctive clothing styles and a variety of anti authoritarian ideologies  150  By the beginning of the 1980s  faster  more aggressive styles such as hardcore and Oi  had become the predominant mode of punk rock  151  Since punk rock s initial popularity in the 1970s and the renewed interest created by the punk revival of the 1990s  punk rock continues to have a strong underground following  152  This has resulted in several evolved strains of hardcore punk  such as D beat  a distortion heavy subgenre influenced by the UK band Discharge   anarcho punk  such as Crass   grindcore  such as Napalm Death   and crust punk  153  Musicians identifying with or inspired by punk also pursued a broad range of other variations  giving rise to New Wave  post punk and the alternative rock movement  148

significant social and musical phenomenon  it achieved less in the way of record sales  being distributed by small specialty labels such as Stiff Records   154  or American radio airplay  as the radio scene continued to be dominated by mainstream formats such as disco and album oriented rock   155  Punk rock had attracted devotees from the art and collegiate world and soon bands sporting a more literate  arty approach  such as Talking Heads  and Devo began to infiltrate the punk scene  in some quarters the description  New Wave  began to be used to differentiate these less overtly punk bands  156  Record executives  who had been mostly mystified by the punk movement  recognized the potential of the more accessible New Wave acts and began aggressively signing and marketing any band that could claim a remote connection to punk or New Wave  157  Many of these bands  such as The Cars  and The Go Go s can be seen as pop bands marketed as New Wave  158  other existing acts  including The Police  The Pretenders and Elvis Costello  used the New Wave movement as the springboard for relatively long and critically successful careers  159  while  skinny tie  bands exemplified by The Knack  160  or the photogenic Blondie  began as punk acts and moved into more commercial territory  161  Between 1982 and 1985  influenced by Kraftwerk  David Bowie  and Gary Numan  British New Wave went in the direction of such New Romantics as Spandau Ballet  Ultravox  Duran Duran  A Flock of Seagulls  Culture Club  Talk Talk and the Eurythmics  sometimes using the synthesizer to replace all other instruments  162  This period coincided with the rise of MTV and led to a great deal of exposure for this brand of synthpop  creating what has been characterised as a second British Invasion  163  Some more traditional rock bands adapted to the video age and profited from MTV s airplay  most obviously Dire Straits   whose  Money for Nothing  gently poked fun at the station  despite the fact that it had helped make them international stars  164  but in general guitar oriented rock was commercially eclipsed  165   edit  Post punk Main article  Post punk See also  Gothic rock and Industrial

emerged in the later 1970s and early  80s as its more artistic and challenging side  Major influences beside punk bands were The Velvet Underground  The Who  Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart  and the New York based no wave scene which placed an emphasis on performance  including bands such as James Chance and the Contortions  DNA and Sonic Youth  166  Early contributors to the genre included the US bands Pere Ubu  Devo  The Residents and Talking Heads  166  The first wave of British post punk included Gang of Four  Siouxsie and the Banshees and Joy Division  who placed less emphasis on art than their US counterparts and more on the dark emotional qualities of their music  166  Bands like Siouxsie and the Banshees  Bauhaus  The Cure  and The Sisters of Mercy  moved increasingly in this direction to found Gothic rock  which had become the basis of a major sub culture by the early 1980s  167  Similar emotional territory was pursued by Australian acts like The Birthday Party and Nick Cave  166  Members of Bauhaus and Joy Division explored new stylistic territory as Love and Rockets and New Order respectively  166  Another early post punk movement was the industrial music 168  developed by British bands Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire  and New York based Suicide  using a variety of electronic and sampling techniques that emulated the sound of industrial production and which would develop into a variety of forms of post industrial music in the 1980s  169  The second generation of British post punk bands that broke through in the early 1980s  including The Fall  The Pop Group  The Mekons  Echo and the Bunnymen and Teardrop Explodes  tended to move away from dark sonic landscapes  166  Arguably the most successful band to emerge from post punk was Ireland s U2  who incorporated elements of religious imagery together with political commentary into their often anthemic music  and by the late 1980s had become one of the biggest bands in the world  170  Although many post punk bands continued to record and perform  it declined as a movement in the mid 1980s as acts disbanded or moved off to explore other musical areas  but it has continued to influence the development of rock music and has been seen as a major element in the creation of the alternative rock movement  171   edit  New waves and genres in heavy metal Main article  Heavy metal music See also  NWOBHM  Glam metal  and Extreme metal Although many established bands continued to perform and record  heavy metal suffered a hiatus in the face of the punk movement in the mid 1970s  Part of the reaction saw the popularity of bands like Mot rhead  who had adopted a punk sensibility  and Judas Priest  who created a stripped down sound  largely removing the remaining elements of blues music  from their 1978 album Stained Class  172  This change of direction was compared to punk and in the late 1970s became known as the New Wave of British Heavy Metal  NWOBHM   173  These bands were soon followed by acts including Iron Maiden  Vardis  Diamond Head  Saxon  Def Leppard and Venom  many of which began to enjoy considerable success in the USA  174  In the same period Eddie Van Halen established himself as a metal guitar virtuoso after his band s self titled 1978 album  175 Randy Rhoads and Yngwie Malmsteen also became established virtuosos  associated with what would be known as the neoclassical metal style  176  Iron Maiden  one of the central bands in the New Wave of British Heavy Metal  performing in Barcelona in 2006 Inspired by NWOBHM and Van Halen s success  a metal scene began to develop in Southern California from the late 1970s  based on the clubs of L A  s Sunset Strip and including such bands as Quiet Riot  Ratt  M tley Cr e  and W A S P   who  along with similarly styled acts such as New York s Twisted Sister  incorporated the theatrics  and sometimes makeup  of glam rock acts like Alice Cooper and Kiss  175  The lyrics of these glam metal bands characteristically emphasized hedonism and wild behavior and musically were distinguished by rapid fire shred guitar solos  anthemic choruses  and a relatively melodic  pop oriented approach  175  By the mid 1980s bands were beginning to emerge from the L A  scene that pursued a less glam image and a rawer sound  particularly Guns N  Roses  breaking through with the chart topping Appetite for Destruction  1987   and Jane s Addiction  who emerged with their major label debut Nothing s Shocking  the following year  177  In the late 1980s metal fragmented into several subgenres  including thrash metal  which developed in the US from the style known as speed metal  under the influence of hardcore punk  with low register guitar riffs typically overlaid by shredding leads  178  Lyrics often expressed nihilistic views or deal with social issues using visceral  gory language  It was popularised by the  Big Four of Thrash   Metallica  Anthrax  Megadeth  and Slayer  174 Death metal developed out of thrash  particularly influenced by the bands Venom and Slayer  Florida s Death and the Bay Area s Possessed emphasized lyrical elements of blasphemy  diabolism and millenarianism  with vocals usually delivered as guttural  death growls   high pitched screaming  complemented by downtuned  highly distorted guitars and extremely fast double bass percussion  179 Black metal  again influenced by Venom and pioneered by Denmark s Mercyful Fate  Switzerland s Hellhammer and Celtic Frost  and Sweden s Bathory  had many similarities in sound to death metal  but was often intentionally lo fi in production and placed greater emphasis on satanic and pagan themes  180  181  Bathory were particularly important in inspiring the further sub genres of Viking metal and folk metal  182 Power metal emerged in Europe in the late 1980s as a reaction to the harshness of death and black metal and was established by Germany s Helloween  who combined a melodic approach with thrash s speed and energy  183  England s DragonForce 184  and Florida s Iced Earth 185  have a sound indebted to NWOBHM  while acts such as Florida s Kamelot  Finland s Nightwish  Italy s Rhapsody of Fire  and Russia s Catharsis feature a keyboard based  symphonic  sound  sometimes employing orchestras and opera singers  In contrast to other sub genres doom metal  influenced by Gothic rock  slowed down the music  with bands like England s Pagan Altar and Witchfinder General and the United States  Pentagram  Saint Vitus and Trouble  emphasizing melody  down tuned guitars  a  thicker  or  heavier  sound and a sepulchral mood  186  187  American bands such as Queensr che and Dream Theater pioneered an often instrumentally challenging fusion of NWOBHM and progressive rock called progressive metal  188  with bands such as Symphony X combining aspects of power metal and classical music with the style  while Sweden s Opeth developed a unique style indebted to both death metal and atmospheric 70s prog rock  189   edit  Heartland rock Main article  Heartland rock Bruce Springsteen in East Berlin in 1988 American working class oriented heartland rock  characterized by a straightforward musical style  and a concern with the lives of ordinary  blue collar American people  developed in the second half of the 1970s  The term heartland rock was first used to describe Midwestern arena rock groups like Kansas  REO Speedwagon and Styx  but which came to be associated with a more socially concerned form of roots rock more directly influenced by folk  country and rock and roll  190  It has been seen as an American Midwest and Rust Belt counterpart to West Coast country rock and the Southern rock of the American South  191  Led by figures who had initially been identified with punk and New Wave  it was most strongly influenced by acts such as Bob Dylan  The Byrds  Creedence Clearwater Revival and Van Morrison  and the basic rock of  60s garage and the Rolling Stones  192  Exemplified by the commercial success of singer songwriters Bruce Springsteen  Bob Seger  and Tom Petty  along with less widely known acts such as Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes and Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers  it was partly a reaction to post industrial urban decline in the East and Mid West  often dwelling on issues of social disintegration and isolation  beside a form of good time rock and roll revivalism  192  The genre reached its commercial  artistic and influential peak in the mid 1980s  with Springsteen s Born in the USA  1984   topping the charts worldwide and spawning a series of top ten singles  together with the arrival of artists including John Mellencamp  Steve Earle and more gentle singer songwriters such as Bruce Hornsby  192  It can also be heard as an influence on artists as diverse as Billy Joel  193 Kid Rock 194  and The Killers  195  Heartland rock faded away as a recognized genre by the early 1990s  as rock music in general  and blue collar and white working class themes in particular  lost influence with younger audiences  and as heartland s artists turned to more personal works  192  Many heartland rock artists continue to record today with critical and commercial success  most notably Bruce Springsteen  Tom Petty and John Mellencamp  although their works have become more personal and experimental and no longer fit easily into a single genre  Newer artists whose music would perhaps have been labelled heartland rock had it been released in the 1970s or 1980s  such as Missouri s Bottle Rockets and Illinois  Uncle Tupelo  often find themselves labeled alt country  196   edit  The emergence of alternative rock Main article  Alternative rock See also  Jangle pop  College rock  Indie pop  Dream pop  and Shoegaze R E M  was a successful alternative rock band in the 1980s The term alternative rock was coined in the early 1980s to describe rock artists who did not fit into the mainstream genres of the time  Bands dubbed  alternative  had no unified style  but were all seen as distinct from mainstream music  Alternative bands were linked by their collective debt to punk rock  through hardcore  New Wave or the post punk movements  197  Important alternative rock bands of the 1980s in the US included R E M   H sker D   Jane s Addiction  Sonic Youth  and the Pixies  197  and in the UK The Cure  New Order  The Jesus and Mary Chain  and The Smiths  198  Artists were largely confined to independent record labels  building an extensive underground music scene based on college radio  fanzines  touring  and word of mouth  199  They rejected the dominant synthpop of the early 1980s  marking a return to group based guitar rock  200  201  202  Few of these early bands  with the exceptions of R E M  and The Smiths  achieved mainstream success  but despite a lack of spectacular album sales  they exerted a considerable influence on the generation of musicians who came of age in the 1980s and ended up breaking through to mainstream success in the 1990s  Styles of alternative rock in the U S  during the 1980s included jangle pop  associated with the early recordings of R E M   which incorporated the ringing guitars of mid 1960s pop and rock  and college rock  used to describe alternative bands that began in the college circuit and college radio  including acts such as 10 000 Maniacs and The Feelies  197  In the UK Gothic rock was dominant in the early 1980s  but by the end of the decade indie or dream pop 203  like Primal Scream  Bogshed  Half Man Half Biscuit and The Wedding Present  and what were dubbed shoegaze bands like My Bloody Valentine  Ride  Lush  Chapterhouse  and the Boo Radleys  204  Particularly vibrant was the Madchester scene  produced such bands as Happy Mondays  the Inspiral Carpets  and Stone Roses  198  205  The next decade would see the success of grunge in the United States and Britpop in the United Kingdom  bringing alternative rock into the mainstream   edit  Alternative goes mainstream  the 1990s   edit  Grunge Main article  Grunge Nirvana  pictured here in 1992  popularized grunge worldwide  Disaffected by commercialized and highly produced pop and rock in the mid 1980s  bands in Washington state  particularly in the Seattle area  formed a new style of rock which sharply contrasted with the mainstream music of the time  206  The developing genre came to be known as  grunge   a term descriptive of the dirty sound of the music and the unkempt appearance of most musicians  who actively rebelled against the over groomed images of popular artists  206  Grunge fused elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a single sound  and made heavy use of guitar distortion  fuzz and feedback  206  The lyrics were typically apathetic and angst filled  and often concerned themes such as social alienation and entrapment  although it was also known for its dark humor and parodies of commercial rock  206  Bands such as Green River  Soundgarden  the Melvins and Skin Yard pioneered the genre  with Mudhoney becoming the most successful by the end of the decade  However  grunge remained largely a local phenomenon until 1991  when Nirvana s Nevermind became a huge success thanks to the lead single  Smells Like Teen Spirit   207 Nevermind was more melodic than its predecessors  but the band refused to employ traditional corporate promotion and marketing mechanisms  During 1991 and 1992  other grunge albums such as Pearl Jam s Ten  Soundgarden s Badmotorfinger and Alice in Chains  Dirt  along with the Temple of the Dog album featuring members of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden  became among the 100 top selling albums  208  The popular breakthrough of these grunge bands prompted Rolling Stone to nickname Seattle  the new Liverpool   209  Major record labels signed most of the remaining grunge bands in Seattle  while a second influx of acts moved to the city in the hope of success  210  However  with the death of Kurt Cobain and the subsequent break up of Nirvana in 1994  touring problems for Pearl Jam and the departure of Alice in Chains  lead singer Layne Staley in 1996  the genre began to decline  partly to be overshadowed by Britpop and more commercial sounding post grunge  211   edit  Britpop Main article  Britpop Oasis performing in 2005 Britpop emerged from the British alternative rock scene of the early 1990s and was characterised by bands particularly influenced by British guitar music of the 1960s and 1970s  198 The Smiths were a major influence  as were bands of the Madchester scene  which had dissolved in the early 1990s  51  The movement has been seen partly as a reaction against various U S  based  musical and cultural trends in the late 1980s and early 1990s  particularly the grunge phenomenon and as a reassertion of a British rock identity  198  Britpop was varied in style  but often used catchy tunes and hooks  beside lyrics with particularly British concerns and the adoption of the iconography of the 1960s British Invasion  including the symbols of British identity previously utilised by the mods  212  It was launched around 1992 with releases by groups such as Suede and Blur  who were soon joined by others including Oasis  Pulp  Supergrass and Elastica  who produced a series of top ten albums and singles  198  For a while the contest between Blur and Oasis was built by the popular press into  The Battle of Britpop   initially won by Blur  but with Oasis achieving greater long term and international success  directly influencing a third generation of Britpop bands  including The Boo Radleys  Ocean Colour Scene and Cast  213  Britpop groups brought British alternative rock into the mainstream and formed the backbone of a larger British cultural movement known as Cool Britannia  214  Although its more popular bands  particularly Blur and Oasis  were able to spread their commercial success overseas  especially to the United States  the movement had largely fallen apart by the end of the decade  198   edit  Post grunge Main article  Post grunge Foo Fighters performing an acoustic show in 2007 The term post grunge was coined for the generation of bands that followed the emergence into the mainstream and subsequent hiatus  of the Seattle grunge bands  Post grunge bands emulated their attitudes and music  but with a more radio friendly commercially oriented sound  211  Often they worked through the major labels and came to incorporate diverse influences from jangle pop  pop punk  alternative metal or hard rock  211  The term post grunge was meant to be pejorative  suggesting that they were simply musically derivative  or a cynical response to an  authentic  rock movement  215  From 1994  former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl s new band  the Foo Fighters  helped popularize the genre and define its parameters  216  Some post grunge bands  like Candlebox  were from Seattle  but the sub genre was marked by a broadening of the geographical base of grunge  with bands like Los Angeles  Audioslave  and Georgia s Collective Soul and beyond the US to Australia s Silverchair and Britain s Bush  who all cemented post grunge as one of the most commercially viable sub genres of the late 1990s  197  211  Although male bands predominated  female solo artist Alanis Morissette s 1995 album Jagged Little Pill  labelled as post grunge  also became a multi platinum hit  217  Bands like Creed and Nickelback took post grunge into the 21st century with considerable commercial success  abandoning most of the angst and anger of the original movement for more conventional anthems  narratives and romantic songs  and were followed in this vein by new acts including Shinedown  Seether  3 Doors Down and Puddle of Mudd  215   edit  Pop punk Main article  Pop punk Green Day performing in 2009 The origins of 1990s pop punk can be seen in the more song oriented bands of the 1970s punk movement like The Buzzcocks and The Clash  commercially successful New Wave acts such as The Jam and The Undertones  and the more hardcore influenced elements of alternative rock in the 1980s  218  Pop punk tends to use power pop melodies and chord changes with speedy punk tempos and loud guitars  219  Punk music provided the inspiration for some California based bands on independent labels in the early 1990s  including Rancid  Pennywise  Weezer and Green Day  218  In 1994 Green Day moved to a major label and produced the album Dookie  which found a new  largely teenage  audience and proved a surprise diamond selling success  leading to a series of hit singles  including two number ones in the US  197  They were soon followed by the eponymous d but from Weezer  which spawned three top ten singles in the US  220  This success opened the door for the multi platinum sales of metallic punk band The Offspring with Smash  1994   197  This first wave of pop punk reached its commercial peak with Green Day s Nimrod  1997  and The Offspring s Americana  1998   221  A second wave of pop punk was spearheaded by Blink 182  with their breakthrough album Enema of the State  1999   followed by bands such as Good Charlotte  Bowling for Soup and Sum 41  who made use of humour in their videos and had a more radio friendly tone to their music  while retaining the speed  some of the attitude and even the look of 1970s punk  218  Later pop punk bands  including Simple Plan  The All American Rejects and Fall Out Boy  had a sound that has been described as closer to 1980s hardcore  while still achieving considerable commercial success  218

and alternative rock were used interchangeably  222  By the mid 1990s  as elements of the movement began to attract mainstream interest  particularly grunge and then Britpop  post grunge and pop punk  the term alternative began to lose its meaning  222  Those bands following the less commercial contours of the scene were increasingly referred to by the label indie  222  They characteristically attempted to retain control of their careers by releasing albums on their own or small independent labels  while relying on touring  word of mouth  and airplay on independent or college radio stations for promotion  222  Linked by an ethos more than a musical approach  the indie rock movement encompassed a wide range of styles  from hard edged  grunge influenced bands like The Cranberries and Superchunk  through do it yourself experimental bands like Pavement  to punk folk singers such as Ani DiFranco  197  198  It has been noted that indie rock has a relatively high proportion of female artists compared with preceding rock genres  a tendency exemplified by the development of feminist informed Riot Grrrl music  223  Many countries have developed an extensive local indie scene  flourishing with bands with enough popularity to survive inside the respective country  but virtually unknown outside them  224  By the end of the 1990s many recognisable sub genres  most with their origins in the late  80s alternative movement  were included under the umbrella of indie  Lo fi eschewed polished recording techniques for a D I Y  ethos and was spearheaded by Beck  Sebadoh and Pavement  197  The work of Talk Talk and Slint helped inspire both post rock  an experimental style influenced by jazz and electronic music  pioneered by Bark Psychosis and taken up by acts such as Tortoise  Stereolab  and Laika  225  226  as well as leading to more dense and complex  guitar based math rock  developed by acts like Polvo and Chavez  227  Space rock looked back to progressive roots  with drone heavy and minimalist acts like Spaceman 3  the two bands created out of its split  Spectrum and Spiritualized  and later groups including Flying Saucer Attack  Godspeed You Black Emperor  and Quickspace  228  In contrast  Sadcore emphasised pain and suffering through melodic use of acoustic and electronic instrumentation in the music of bands like American Music Club and Red House Painters  229  while the revival of Baroque pop reacted against lo fi and experimental music by placing an emphasis on melody and classical instrumentation  with artists like Arcade Fire  Belle and Sebastian and Rufus Wainright  230   edit  Alternative metal  rap rock and nu metal Main article  Heavy metal music See also  Alternative metal  Rap rock  Rap metal  and Nu metal Alternative metal emerged from the hardcore scene of alternative rock in the US in the later 1980s  but gained a wider audience after grunge broke into the mainstream in the early 1990s  231  Early alternative metal

punk  The Jesus Lizard and Helmet mixing noise rock  Ministry and Nine Inch Nails influenced by industrial music  Monster Magnet moving into psychedelia  Pantera  Sepultura and White Zombie creating groove metal  while Biohazard and Faith No More turned to hip hop and rap  231  Linkin Park performing in 2009 Hip hop had gained attention from rock acts in the early 1980s  including The Clash with  The Magnificent Seven   1981  and Blondie with  Rapture   1981   232  233  Early crossover acts included Run DMC and the Beastie Boys  234 Detroit rapper Esham became known for his  acid rap  style  which fused rapping with a sound that was often based in rock and heavy metal  235  236  Rappers who sampled rock songs included Ice T  The Fat Boys  LL Cool J  Public Enemy and Whodini  237  The mixing of thrash metal and rap was pioneered by Anthrax on their 1987 comedy influenced single  I m the Man   237  In 1990  Faith No More broke into the mainstream with their single  Epic   often seen as the first truly successful combination of heavy metal with rap  238  This paved the way for the success of existing bands like 24 7 Spyz and Living Colour  and new acts including Rage Against the Machine and Red Hot Chili Peppers  who all fused rock and hip hop among other influences  215  237  Among the first wave of performers to gain mainstream success as rap rock were 311  239 Bloodhound Gang  240  and Kid Rock  241  A more metallic sound   nu metal   was pursued by bands including Limp Bizkit  Korn and Slipknot  237  Later in the decade this style  which contained a mix of grunge  punk  metal  rap and turntable scratching  spawned a wave of successful bands like Linkin Park  P O D  and Staind  who were often classified as rap metal or nu metal  the first of which are the best selling band of the genre  242  In 2001  nu metal reached its peak with albums like Staind s Break the Cycle  P O D s Satellite  Slipknot s Iowa and Linkin Park s Hybrid Theory  New bands also emerged like Disturbed  post grunge hard rock band Godsmack and Papa Roach  whose major label d but Infest became a platinum hit  243  However  by 2002 there were signs that nu metal s mainstream popularity was weakening  215  Korn s long awaited fifth album Untouchables  and Papa Roach s second album Lovehatetragedy  did not sell as well as their previous releases  while nu metal bands were played more infrequently on rock radio stations and MTV began focusing on pop punk and emo  244  Since then  many bands have changed to a more conventional hard rock or heavy metal music sound  244   edit  Post Britpop Main article  Post Britpop Coldplay in 2008 From about 1997  as dissatisfaction grew with the concept of Cool Britannia  and Britpop as a movement began to dissolve  emerging bands began to avoid the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it  245  246  Many of these bands tended to mix elements of British traditional rock  or British trad rock   247  particularly the Beatles  Rolling Stones and Small Faces  248  with American influences  including post grunge  249  250  Drawn from across the United Kingdom  with several important bands emerging from the north of England  Scotland  Wales and Northern Ireland   the themes of their music tended to be less parochially centred on British  English and London life and more introspective than had been the case with Britpop at its height  251  252  This  beside a greater willingness to engage with the American press and fans  may have helped some of them in achieving international success  253  Post Britpop bands have been seen as presenting the image of the rock star as an ordinary person and their increasingly melodic music was criticised for being bland or derivative  254  Post Britpop bands like The Verve with Urban Hymns  1997   Radiohead from OK Computer  1997   Travis from The Man Who  1999   Stereophonics from Performance and Cocktails  1999   Feeder from Echo Park  2001  and particularly Coldplay from their debut album Parachutes  2000   achieved much wider international success than most of the Britpop groups that had preceded them  and were some of the most commercially successful acts of the late 1990s and early 2000s  arguably providing a launchpad for the subsequent garage rock or post punk revival  which has also been seen as a reaction to their introspective brand of rock  250

including Quicksand  259 Girls Against Boys 260  and The Jesus Lizard  261  Bands that formed in the 1990s included Thursday  262 Thrice  263 Finch  264  and Poison the Well  265  Members of Fugazi

abrasive  barking style  266  The style was pioneered by bands Rites of Spring and Embrace  the last formed by Ian MacKaye  whose Dischord Records became a major centre for the emerging D C  emo scene  releasing work by Rites of Spring  Dag Nasty  Nation of Ulysses and Fugazi  266  Fugazi emerged as the definitive early emo band  gaining a fanbase among alternative rock followers  not least for their overtly anti commercial stance  266  The early emo scene operated as an underground  with short lived bands releasing small run vinyl records on tiny independent labels  266  The mid  90s sound of emo was defined by bands like Jawbreaker and Sunny Day Real Estate who incorporated elements of grunge and more melodic rock  267  Only after the breakthrough of grunge and pop punk into the mainstream did emo come to wider attention with the success of Weezer s Pinkerton  1996  album  which utilised pop punk  266  Late 1990s bands drew on the work of Fugazi  SDRE  Jawbreaker and Weezer  including The Promise Ring  The Get Up Kids  Braid  Texas Is the Reason  Joan of Arc  Jets to Brazil and most successfully Jimmy Eat World  and by the end of the millennium it was one of the more popular indie styles in the US  266  Emo broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the platinum selling success of Jimmy Eat World s Bleed American  2001  and Dashboard Confessional s The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most  2003   268  The new emo had a much more mainstream sound than in the 90s and a far greater appeal amongst adolescents than its earlier incarnations  268  At the same time  use of the term emo expanded beyond the musical genre  becoming associated with fashion  a hairstyle and any music that expressed emotion  269  The term emo has been applied by critics and journalists to a variety of artists  including multi platinum acts such as Fall Out Boy 270  and My Chemical Romance 271  and disparate groups such as Paramore 270  and Panic at the Disco  272  even when they protest the label  By 2003 post hardcore bands had also caught the attention of major labels and began to enjoy mainstream success in the album charts  262  263  A number of these bands were seen as a more aggressive offshoot of emo and given the often vague label of screamo  273  Around this time  a new wave of post hardcore bands began to emerge onto the scene that incorporated more pop

and Berlin  but rapidly faded as a recognisable genre  339  Dance punk  mixing post punk sounds with disco and funk  had developed in the 1980s  but it was revived among some bands of the garage rock post punk revival in the early years of the new millennium  particularly among New York acts such as Liars  The Rapture and Radio 4  joined by dance oriented acts who adopted rock sounds such as Out Hud  340  In Britain the combination of indie with dance punk was dubbed new rave in publicity for Klaxons and the term was picked up and applied by the NME to bands 341  including Trash Fashion  342 New Young Pony Club  343 Hadouken   Late of the Pier  Test Icicles 344  and Shitdisco  341  forming a scene with a similar visual aesthetic to earlier rave music  341  345  Renewed interest in electronic music and nostalgia for the 1980s led to the beginnings of a synthpop revival  with acts including Adult and Fischerspooner  In 2003 4 it began to move into the mainstream with Ladytron  the Postal Service  Cut Copy  the Bravery and  with most commercial success  The Killers all producing records that incorporated vintage synthesizer sounds and styles which contrasted with the dominant sounds of post grunge and nu metal  346  The style was picked up by a large number of performers  particularly female solo artists  leading the British and other media to proclaim a new era of the female electropop star  Artists named included British acts Little Boots  La Roux and Ladyhawke  347  348  Male acts that emerged in the same period included Calvin Harris  349 Frankmusik  350 Hurts  351 Kaskade  352 LMFAO  353  and Owl City  whose single  Fireflies   2009  reached the top of the Billboard chart  354  355   edit  Social impact Main article  Social effects of rock music The worldwide popularity of rock music meant that it became a major influence on culture  fashion and social attitudes  Different sub genres of rock were adopted by  and became central to  the identity of a large number of sub cultures  In the 1950s and 1960s  respectively  British youths adopted the Teddy Boy and Rockers subcultures  which revolved around US rock and roll  356  The counter culture of the 1960s was closely associated with psychedelic rock  356  The mid 1970s punk subculture began in the US  but it was given a distinctive look by British designer Vivian Westwood  a look which spread worldwide  357  Out of the punk scene  the Goth and Emo subcultures grew  both of which presented distinctive visual styles  358  The 1969 Woodstock Festival was seen as a celebration of the counter cultural lifestyle When an international rock culture developed  it was able to supplant cinema as the major sources of fashion influence  359  Paradoxically  followers of rock music have often mistrusted the world of fashion  which has been seen as elevating image above substance  359  Rock fashions have been seen as combining elements of different cultures and periods  as well as expressing divergent views on sexuality and gender  and rock music in general has been noted and criticised for facilitating greater sexual freedom  359  360  Rock has also been associated with various forms of drug use  including the stimulants taken by some mods in the early to mid 1960s  through the LSD linked with psychedelic rock in the late 1960s and early 1970s  and sometimes to cannabis  cocaine and heroin  all of which have been eulogised in song  361  362  Rock has been credited with changing attitudes to race by opening up African American culture to white audiences  but at the same time  rock has been accused of appropriating and exploiting that culture  363  364  While rock music has absorbed many influences and introduced Western audiences to different musical traditions  365  the global spread of rock music has been interpreted as a form of cultural imperialism  366  Rock music inherited the folk tradition of protest song  making political statements on subjects such as war  religion  poverty  civil rights  justice and the environment  367  Political activism reached a mainstream peak with the  Do They Know It s Christmas   single  1984  and Live Aid concert for Ethiopia in 1985  which  while successfully raising awareness of world poverty and funds for aid  have also been criticised  along with similar events   for providing a stage for self aggrandisement and increased profits for the rock stars involved  368  Since its early development rock music has been associated with rebellion against social and political norms  most obviously in early rock and roll s rejection of an adult dominated culture  the counter culture s rejection of consumerism and conformity and punk s rejection of all forms of social convention  369  however  it can also be seen as providing a means of commercial exploitation of such ideas and of diverting youth away from political action  370   edit  See also Rock music portal Wikipedia books  Rock music
