member states  Belgium  i  b ld  m  BEL j m   officially the Kingdom of Belgium  is a federal state in Western Europe  It is a founding member of the European Union and hosts the EU s headquarters  and those of several other major international organisations such as NATO  nb 1  Belgium covers an area of 30 528 square kilometres  11 787 sq mi   and it has a population of about 11 million people  Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe  Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups  the Dutch speakers  mostly Flemish  about 60    and the French speakers  mostly Walloons  about 40    plus a small group of German speakers  Belgium s two largest regions are the Dutch speaking region of Flanders in the north and the French speaking southern region of Wallonia  The Brussels Capital Region  officially bilingual  is a mostly French speaking enclave within the Flemish Region  2  A German speaking Community exists in eastern Wallonia  6  Belgium s linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in the political history and a complex system of government  7  8  Historically  Belgium  the Netherlands and Luxembourg were known as the Low Countries  which used to cover a somewhat larger area than the current Benelux group of states  The region was called Belgica in Latin because of the Roman province Gallia Belgica which covered more or less the same area  From the end of the Middle Ages until the 17th century  it was a prosperous centre of commerce and culture  From the 16th century until the Belgian Revolution in 1830  when Belgium seceded from the Netherlands  many battles between European powers were fought in the area of Belgium  causing it to be dubbed the battleground of Europe  9  a reputation strengthened by both World Wars  Upon its independence  Belgium participated in the Industrial Revolution 10  11  and  during the course of the 20th century  possessed a number of colonies in Africa  12  The second half of the 20th century was marked by the rise of contrasts between the Flemish and the Francophones fuelled by language differences on the one hand and an asymmetrical economic evolution of Flanders and Wallonia on the other hand  These ongoing conflicts have caused far reaching reforms of the formerly unitary Belgian state into a federal state and a very long political instability  13  14  15

brown and yellow areas  and the Bishopric of Li ge  green  The name  Belgium  is derived from Gallia Belgica  a Roman province in the northernmost part of Gaul that  before Roman invasion in 100 BC  was inhabited by the Belgae  a mix of Celtic and Germanic peoples  16  17  A gradual immigration by Germanic Frankish tribes during the 5th century brought the area under the rule of the Merovingian kings  A gradual shift of power during the 8th century led the kingdom of the Franks to evolve into the Carolingian Empire  18  The Treaty of Verdun in 843 divided the region into Middle and West Francia and therefore into a set of more or less independent fiefdoms which  during the Middle Ages  were vassals either of the King of France or of the Holy Roman Emperor  18  Many of these fiefdoms were united in the Burgundian Netherlands of the 14th and 15th centuries  19 Emperor Charles V extended the personal union of the Seventeen Provinces in the 1540s  making it far more than a personal union by the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549 and increased his influence over the Prince Bishopric of Li ge  20  The Eighty Years  War  1568 1648  divided the Low Countries into the northern United Provinces  Belgica Foederata in Latin  the  Federated Netherlands   and the Southern Netherlands  Belgica Regia  the  Royal Netherlands    The latter were ruled successively by the Spanish and the Austrian Habsburgs and comprised most of modern Belgium  This was the theatre of most Franco Spanish and Franco Austrian wars during the 17th and 18th centuries  Following the campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars  the Low Countries including territories that were never nominally under Habsburg rule  such as the Prince Bishopric of Li ge were annexed by the French First Republic  ending Austrian rule in the region  The reunification of the Low Countries as the United Kingdom of the Netherlands occurred at the dissolution of the First French Empire in 1815  The 1830 Belgian Revolution led to the establishment of a Catholic and bourgeois  officially French speaking and neutral  independent Belgium under a provisional government and a national congress  21  22  Since the installation of Leopold I as king on 21 July 1831  which is now celebrated as Belgium s National Day 23    Belgium has been a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy  with a laicist constitution based on the Napoleonic code  Although the franchise was initially restricted  universal suffrage for men was introduced after the general strike of 1893  with plural voting until 1919  and for women in 1949  Episode of the Belgian Revolution of 1830  1834   by Egide Charles Gustave Wappers  Museum of Ancient Art  Brussels The main political parties of the 19th century were the Catholic Party and the Liberal Party  with the Belgian Labour Party emerging towards the end of the 19th century  French was originally the single official language adopted by the nobility and the bourgeoisie  It progressively lost its overall importance as Dutch became recognised as well  This recognition became official in 1898 and in 1967 a Dutch version of the Constitution was legally accepted  24  The Berlin Conference of 1885 ceded control of the Congo Free State to King Leopold II as his private possession  From around 1900 there was growing international concern for the extreme and savage treatment of the Congolese population under Leopold II  for whom the Congo was primarily a source of revenue from ivory and rubber production  In 1908 this outcry led the Belgian state to assume responsibility for the government of the colony  henceforth called the Belgian Congo  25  Germany invaded Belgium in 1914 as part of the Schlieffen Plan and much of the Western Front fighting of World War I occurred in western parts of the country  The opening months of the war were known as the Rape of Belgium due to German atrocities  Belgium took over the German colonies of Ruanda Urundi  modern day Rwanda and Burundi  during the war  and they were mandated to Belgium in 1924 by the League of Nations  In the aftermath of the First World War  the Prussian districts of Eupen and Malmedy were annexed by Belgium in 1925  thereby causing the presence of a German speaking minority  The country was again invaded by Germany in 1940 and was occupied until its liberation by the Allies in 1944  After World War II  a general strike forced king Leopold III  who many saw as collaborating with the Germans during the war  to abdicate in 1951  citation needed  The Belgian Congo gained independence in 1960 during the Congo Crisis  26  Ruanda Urundi followed with its independence two years later  Belgium joined NATO as a founding member and formed the Benelux group of nations with the Netherlands and Luxembourg  Belgium became one of the six founding members of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 and of the European Atomic Energy Community and European Economic Community  established in 1957  The latter is now the European Union  for which Belgium hosts major administrations and institutions  including the European Commission  the Council of the European Union and the extraordinary and committee sessions of the European Parliament   edit  Politics Main articles  Politics of Belgium and Belgian federal government Albert II  King of the Belgians Belgium is a constitutional  popular monarchy and a parliamentary democracy  The bicameral federal parliament is composed of a Senate and a Chamber of Representatives  The former is made up of 40 directly elected politicians and 21 representatives appointed by the 3 Community parliaments  10 co opted senators and the children of the king  as Senators by Right who in practice do not cast their vote  The Chamber s 150 representatives are elected under a proportional voting system from 11 electoral districts  Belgium has compulsory voting and thus holds one of the highest rates of voter turnout in the world  27  The King  currently Albert II  is the head of state  though with limited prerogatives  He appoints ministers  including a Prime Minister  that have the confidence of the Chamber of Representatives to form the federal government  The Council of Ministers is composed of no more than fifteen members  With the possible exception of the Prime Minister  the Council of Ministers is composed of an equal number of Dutch speaking members and French speaking members  28  The judicial system is based on civil law and originates from the Napoleonic code  The Court of Cassation is the court of last resort  with the Court of Appeal one level below  Belgium s political institutions are complex  most political power is organised around the need to represent the main cultural communities  29  Since around 1970  the significant national Belgian political parties have split into distinct components that mainly represent the political and linguistic interests of these communities  30  The major parties in each Community  though close to the political centre  belong to three main groups  Christian Democrats  Liberals  and Social Democrats  31  Further notable parties came into being well after the middle of last century  mainly around linguistic  nationalist  or environmental themes and recently smaller ones of some specific liberal nature  30  Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo A string of Christian Democrat coalition governments from 1958 was broken in 1999 after the first dioxin crisis  a major food contamination scandal  32  33  34  A  rainbow coalition  emerged from six parties  the Flemish and the French speaking Liberals  Social Democrats  Greens  35  Later  a  purple coalition  of Liberals and Social Democrats formed after the Greens lost most of their seats in the 2003 election  36  The government led by Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt from 1999 to 2007 achieved a balanced budget  some tax reforms  a labour market reform  scheduled nuclear phase out and instigated legislation allowing more stringent war crime and more lenient soft drug usage prosecution  Restrictions on withholding euthanasia were reduced and same sex marriage legalized  The government promoted active diplomacy in Africa 37  and opposed the invasion of Iraq  38  Verhofstadt s coalition fared badly in the June 2007 elections  For more than a year  the country experienced a political crisis  39  This crisis was such that many observers speculated on a possible partition of Belgium  13  14  15  From 21 December 2007 until 20 March 2008 the temporary Verhofstadt III Government was in office  This coalition of the Flemish and Francophone Christian Democrats  the Flemish and Francophone Liberals together with the Francophone Social Democrats was an interim government until 20 March 2008  On that day a new government  led by Flemish Christian Democrat Yves Leterme  the actual winner of the federal elections of June 2007  was sworn in by the king  On 15 July 2008 Leterme announced the resignation of the cabinet to the king  as no progress in constitutional reforms had been made  40  In December 2008 he once more offered his resignation to the king after a crisis surrounding the sale of Fortis to BNP Paribas  41  At this juncture  his resignation was accepted and Christian Democratic and Flemish Herman Van Rompuy was sworn in as Prime Minister on 30 December 2008  42  After Herman Van Rompuy was designated the first permanent President of the European Council on 19 November 2009  he offered the resignation of his government to King Albert II on 25 November 2009  A few hours later  the new government under Prime Minister Yves Leterme was sworn in  On 22 April 2010  Leterme again offered the resignation of his cabinet to the king 43  after one of the coalition partners  the OpenVLD  withdrew from the government  and on 26 April 2010 King Albert officially accepted the resignation  44  The Parliamentary elections in Belgium on 13 June 2010 saw the Flemish nationalist N VA become the largest party in Flanders  and the Socialist Party PS the largest party in Wallonia  45  Until December 2011  Belgium was governed by Leterme s caretaker government awaiting the end of the deadlocked negotiations for formation of a new government  By 30 March 2011 this set a new world record for the elapsed time without an official government  previously held by war torn Iraq  Finally  in December 2011 the current government led by Walloon socialist Prime Ministre Elio Di Rupo was sworn in   edit  Communities

area   Walloon Region   French and German language areas Following a usage which can be traced back to the Burgundian and Habsburgian courts  46  in the 19th century it was necessary to speak French to belong to the governing upper class  and those who could only speak Dutch were effectively second class citizens  47  Late that century  and continuing into the 20th century  Flemish movements evolved to counter this situation  48  While the Walloons and most Brusselers adopted French as their first language  the Flemings refused to do so and succeeded progressively in imposing Dutch as Flanders  official language  48  Following World War II  Belgian politics became increasingly dominated by the autonomy of its two main language communities  49  Intercommunal tensions rose and the constitution was amended to minimise the potential for conflict  49  Based on the four language areas defined in 1962 63  the Dutch  bilingual  French and German language areas   consecutive revisions of the country s constitution in 1970  1980  1988 and 1993 established a unique federal state with segregated political power into three levels  50  51  The federal government  based in Brussels  The three language communities  the Flemish Community  Dutch speaking   the Wallonia Brussels Federation  French speaking   the German speaking Community  The three regions  the Flemish Region  subdivided into five provinces  the Walloon Region  subdivided into five provinces  the Brussels Capital Region  The constitutional language areas determine the official languages in their municipalities  as well as the geographical limits of the empowered institutions for specific matters  52  Although this would allow for seven parliaments and governments  when the Communities and Regions were created in 1980  Flemish politicians decided to merge both  53  Thus the Flemings just have one single institutional body of parliament and government is empowered for all except federal and specific municipal matters  nb 2  The overlapping boundaries of the Regions and Communities have created two notable peculiarities  the territory of the Brussels Capital Region  which came into existence nearly a decade after the other regions  is included in both the Flemish and French Communities  and the territory of the German speaking Community lies wholly within the Walloon Region  Conflicts about jurisdiction between the bodies are resolved by the Constitutional Court of Belgium  The structure is intended as a compromise to allow different cultures to live together peacefully  10  The Federal State s authority includes justice  defence  federal police  social security  nuclear energy  monetary policy and public debt  and other aspects of public finances  State owned companies include the Belgian Post Group and Belgian Railways  The Federal Government is responsible for the obligations of Belgium and its federalized institutions towards the European Union and NATO  It controls substantial parts of public health  home affairs and foreign affairs  54  The budget without the debt controlled by the federal government amounts to about 50  of the national fiscal income  The federal government employs around 12  of the civil servants  55  Communities exercise their authority only within linguistically determined geographical boundaries  originally oriented towards the individuals of a Community s language  culture  including audiovisual media   education and the use of the relevant language  Extensions to personal matters less directly connected with language comprise health policy  curative and preventive medicine  and assistance to individuals  protection of youth  social welfare  aid to families  immigrant assistance services  and so on    56  Regions have authority in fields that can be broadly associated with their territory  These include economy  employment  agriculture  water policy  housing  public works  energy  transport  the environment  town and country planning  nature conservation  credit and foreign trade  They supervise the provinces  municipalities and intercommunal utility companies  57  In several fields  the different levels each have their own say on specifics  With education  for instance  the autonomy of the Communities neither includes decisions about the compulsory aspect nor allows for setting minimum requirements for awarding qualifications  which remain federal matters  54  Each level of government can be involved in scientific research and international relations associated with its powers  The treaty making power of the Regions  and Communities  Governments is the broadest of all the Federating units of all the Federations all over the world  58  59  60   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of

plain in the north west and the central plateau both belong to the Anglo Belgian Basin  the Ardennes uplands in the south east are part of the Hercynian orogenic belt  The Paris Basin reaches a small fourth area at Belgium s southernmost tip  Belgian Lorraine  61  The coastal plain consists mainly of sand dunes and polders  Further inland lies a smooth  slowly rising landscape irrigated by numerous waterways  with fertile valleys and the northeastern sandy plain of the Campine  Kempen   The thickly forested hills and plateaus of the Ardennes are more rugged and rocky with caves and small gorges  Extending westward into France  this area is eastwardly connected to the Eifel in Germany by the High Fens plateau  on which the Signal de Botrange forms the country s highest point at 694 metres  2 277 ft   62  63  The climate is maritime temperate with significant precipitation in all seasons  K ppen climate classification  Cfb   like most of northwest Europe  64  The average

Region within the Boreal Kingdom  66  According to the World Wide Fund for Nature  the territory of Belgium belongs to the ecoregion of Atlantic mixed forests  67  Because of its high population density  its location in the centre of Western Europe and inadequate political effort  Belgium faces serious environmental problems  A 2003 report suggested Belgian natural waters  rivers and groundwater  to have the lowest water quality of the 122 countries studied  68  In the 2006 pilot Environmental Performance Index  Belgium scored 75 9  for overall environmental performance and was ranked lowest of the EU member countries  though it was only 39th of 133 countries  69   edit  Provinces of Belgium The territory of Belgium is divided into three Regions  two of which  Flanders and

infrastructure are integrated with the rest of Europe  Its location at the heart of a highly industrialized region helped make it the world s 15th largest trading nation in 2007  71  72  The economy is characterized by a highly productive work force  high GNP and high exports per capita  73  Belgium s main imports are raw materials  machinery and equipment  chemicals  raw diamonds  pharmaceuticals  foodstuffs  transportation equipment  and oil products  Its main exports are machinery and equipment  chemicals  finished diamonds  metals and metal products  and foodstuffs  74  The Belgian economy is heavily service oriented and shows a dual nature  a dynamic Flemish economy and a Walloon economy that lags behind  10  75  nb 3  One of the founding members of the European Union  Belgium strongly supports an open economy and the extension of the powers of EU institutions to integrate member economies  Since 1922  through the Belgium Luxembourg Economic Union  Belgium and Luxembourg have been a single trade market with customs and currency union  76  Steelmaking along the Meuse River at Ougr e  near Li ge Belgium was the first continental European country to undergo the Industrial Revolution  in the early 19th century  77 Li ge and Charleroi rapidly developed mining and steelmaking  which flourished until the mid 20th century in the Sambre Meuse valley  the sillon industriel and made Belgium one of the top three most industrialized nations in the world from 1830 to 1910  78  79  However  by the 1840s the textile industry of Flanders was in severe crisis  and the region experienced famine from 1846 to 1850  80  81  After World War II  Ghent and Antwerp experienced a rapid expansion of the chemical and petroleum industries  The 1973 and 1979 oil crises sent the economy into a recession  it was particularly prolonged in Wallonia  where the steel industry had become less competitive and experienced serious decline  82  In the 1980s and 1990s  the economic centre of the country continued to shift northwards and is now concentrated in the populous Flemish Diamond area  83  By the end of the 1980s  Belgian macroeconomic policies had resulted in a cumulative government debt of about 120  of GDP  As of 2006  the budget was balanced and public debt was equal to 90 30  of GDP  84  In 2005 and 2006  real GDP growth rates of 1 5  and 3 0   respectively  were slightly above the average for the Euro area  Unemployment rates of 8 4  in 2005 and 8 2  in 2006 were close to the area average  By October 2010  this had grown to 8 5  compared to an average rate of 9 6  for the European Union as a whole  EU 27   85  86  From 1832 until 2002  Belgium s currency was the Belgian franc  Belgium switched to the euro in 2002  with the first sets of euro coins being minted in 1999  The standard Belgian euro coins designated for circulation show the portrait of King Albert II  Despite a 18  decrease observed from 1970 to 1999  Belgium still had in 1999 the highest rail network density within the European Union with 113 8 km 1 000 km2  Due to the large population density in Belgium  this number corresponds to the quite low amount of 3 40  kilometers per capita in comparison to the mean EU value of 4 06   On the other hand  the same period of time  1970 1999  has seen a huge growth   56   of the motorway network  In 1999  the density of km motorways per 1000 km2 and 1000 inhabitants amounted to 55 1 and 16 5 respectively and were significantly superior to the EU s means of 13 7 and 15 9  87  Belgium however experiences one of the most congested traffic in Europe  In 2010  commuters to the cities of Brussels and Antwerp spent respectively 65 and 64 hours a year in traffic jams  88  Like in most small european countries  more than 80  of the airways traffic is handled by a single airport  the Brussels Airport  The ports of Antwerp and Zeebrugge share more than 80  of Belgian maritime traffic  Antwerp being the second European harbour with a gross weight of goods handled of 115 988 000 t in 2000 after a growth of 10 9  over the preceeding five years  87  89   edit  Military Main article  Belgian Army The Belgian Armed Forces have about 46 000 active troops  This number corresponded in 2009 to a yearly defence budget of  6 billion  11th in the EU  or 1 24  of GDP  19th in the EU   90  They are organised into one unified structure which consists of four main components  Land Component  or the Army  Air Component  or the Air Force  Naval Component  or the Navy  Medical Component  The operational commands of the four components are subordinate to the Staff Department for Operations and Training of the Ministry of Defence  which is headed by the Assistant Chief of Staff Operations and Training  and to the Chief of Defence  91  The effects of World War II made collective security a priority for Belgian foreign policy  In March 1948 Belgium signed the Treaty of Brussels  and then joined NATO in 1948  However the integration of the armed forces into NATO did not begin until after the Korean War  92   edit  Science and technology Further information  Science and technology in Brussels  Science and

Brussels Belgium has three official languages  which are in order of native speaker population in Belgium  Dutch  French and German  A number of non official minority languages are spoken as well  110  As no census exists  there are no official statistical data regarding the distribution or usage of Belgium s three official languages or their dialects  111  However  various criteria  including the
