Capitalism Portal Economics Portal Politics Portal v t e Milton Friedman  July 31  1912   November 16  2006  was an American economist  statistician  and author who taught at the University of Chicago for more than three decades  He was a recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences  and is known for his research on consumption analysis  monetary history and theory  and the complexity of stabilization policy  1  As a leader of the Chicago school of economics  he influenced the research agenda of the economics profession  A survey of economists ranked Friedman as the second most popular economist of the twentieth century behind John Maynard Keynes  2  and The Economist described him as  the most influential economist of the second half of the 20th century possibly of all of it   3  Friedman s challenges to what he later called  naive Keynesian   as opposed to New Keynesian  theory 4  began with his 1950s reinterpretation of the consumption function  and he became the main advocate opposing activist Keynesian government policies  5  In the late 1960s he described his own approach  along with all of mainstream economics  as using  Keynesian language and apparatus  yet rejecting its  initial  conclusions  6  During the 1960s he promoted an alternative macroeconomic policy known as  monetarism   He theorized there existed a  natural  rate of unemployment  and argued that governments could increase employment above this rate  e g   by increasing aggregate demand  only at the risk of causing inflation to accelerate  7  He argued that the Phillips curve was not stable and predicted what would come to be known as stagflation  8  Though opposed to the existence of the Federal Reserve  Friedman argued that  given that it does exist  a steady  small expansion of the money supply was the only wise policy  9  Friedman was an economic adviser to conservative President Ronald Reagan  His political philosophy extolled the virtues of a free market economic system with minimal intervention  He once stated that his role in eliminating U S  conscription was his proudest accomplishment  and his support for school choice led him to found The Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice  In his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom  Friedman advocated policies such as a volunteer military  freely floating exchange rates  abolition of medical licenses  a negative income tax  and education vouchers  10  His ideas concerning monetary policy  taxation  privatization and deregulation influenced government policies  especially during the 1980s  His monetary theory influenced the Federal Reserve s response to the global financial crisis  11  Milton Friedman s works include many monographs  books  scholarly articles  papers  magazine columns  television programs  videos  and lectures  cover a broad range of topics of microeconomics  macroeconomics  economic history  and public policy issues  His books and essays were widely read  and have had an international influence  including in Communist countries  12  13  14  15  Contents 1 Early life 2 Public service 3 Academic career 3 1 Early years 3 2 University of Chicago 4 Nobel memorial

Early life Friedman was born in Brooklyn  New York  to recent Jewish immigrants Jen  Friedman and S ra Landau from Beregsz sz in Austria Hungary  now Berehove in Ukraine   both of whom worked as dry goods merchants  Shortly after Milton s birth  the family relocated to Rahway  New Jersey  A talented student  Friedman graduated from Rahway High School in 1928  just before his 16th birthday  16  17  Friedman graduated from Rutgers University in New Jersey  where he specialized in mathematics and initially intended to become an actuary  During his time at Rutgers  Friedman became influenced by two economics professors  Arthur F  Burns and Homer Jones  who convinced him that modern economics could help end the Great Depression  After graduating from Rutgers in 1932  Friedman was offered two scholarships to do graduate work  one being Mathematics at Brown University and the other being Economics at the University of Chicago  18 Friedman chose the latter  thus earning an M A  in 1933  He was strongly influenced by Jacob Viner  Frank Knight  and Henry Simons  It was at Chicago that Friedman met his future wife  economist Rose Director  During 1933 34 he had a fellowship at Columbia University  where he studied statistics with renowned statistician and economist Harold Hotelling  He was back in Chicago for 1934 35  spending the year working as a research assistant for Henry Schultz  who was then working on Theory and Measurement of Demand  That year  Friedman formed what would prove to be lifelong friendships with George Stigler and W  Allen Wallis  19   edit  Public service Friedman was initially unable to find academic employment  so during 1935  he followed his friend W  Allen Wallis to Washington  where Franklin D  Roosevelt s New Deal was  a lifesaver  for many young economists  20  At this stage  Friedman said that he and his wife  regarded the job creation programs such as the WPA  CCC  and PWA appropriate responses to the critical situation   but not  the price  and wage fixing measures of the National Recovery Administration and the Agricultural Adjustment Administration   21  Foreshadowing his later ideas  he believed price controls interfered with an essential signaling mechanism to help resources be used where they were most valued  Indeed  Friedman later concluded that all government intervention associated with the New Deal was  the wrong cure for the wrong disease   arguing that the money supply should simply have been expanded  instead of contracted  22  In the publication Monetary History of the United States by Friedman and Anna Schwartz  they argue that the Great Depression was caused by monetary contraction  which was the consequence of poor policymaking by the Federal reserve and the continuous crises of the banking system  23  During 1935  he began work for the National Resources Committee  which was then working on a large consumer budget survey  Ideas from this project later became a part of his Theory of the Consumption Function  Friedman began employment with the National Bureau of Economic Research during autumn 1937 to assist Simon Kuznets in his work on professional income  This work resulted in their jointly authored publication Incomes from Independent Professional Practice  which introduced the concepts of permanent and transitory income  a major component of the Permanent Income Hypothesis that Friedman worked out in greater detail in the 1950s  The book hypothesizes that professional licensing artificially restricts the supply of services and raises prices  During 1940  Friedman was appointed an assistant professor teaching Economics at the University of Wisconsin Madison  but encountered antisemitism in the Economics department and decided to return to government service  24  25  Friedman spent 1941 43 working on wartime tax policy for the Federal Government  as an advisor to senior officials of the United States Department of the Treasury  As a Treasury spokesman during 1942 he advocated a Keynesian policy of taxation  and during this time he helped to invent the payroll withholding tax system  26  He later said in an interview   I have no apologies for it  but I really wish we hadn t found it necessary and I wish there were some way of abolishing withholding now   27  As Friedman grew older he reversed himself  during 2006 he observed   You know  it s a mystery as to why people think Roosevelt s policies pulled us out of the Depression  The problem was that you had unemployed machines and unemployed people  How do you get them together by forming industrial cartels and keeping prices and wages up   28   edit  Academic career  edit  Early years During 1943  Friedman joined the Division of War Research at Columbia University  headed by W  Allen Wallis and Harold Hotelling   where he spent the rest of the war years working as a mathematical statistician  focusing on problems of weapons design  military tactics  and metallurgical experiments  Then during 1945  Friedman submitted Incomes from Independent Professional Practice  co authored with Kuznets and completed during 1940  to Columbia as his doctoral dissertation  The university awarded him a Ph D  during 1946  Friedman spent the 1945 46 academic year teaching at the University of Minnesota  where his friend George Stigler was employed   On February 12  1945  his son  David D  Friedman was born   edit  University of Chicago University of Chicago During 1946  Friedman accepted an offer to teach economic theory at the University of Chicago  a position opened by departure of his former professor Jacob Viner to Princeton University   Friedman would work for the University of Chicago for the next 30 years  There he helped build an intellectual community that produced a number of Nobel Prize winners  known collectively as the Chicago School of Economics  At that time  Arthur Burns  who was then the head of the National Bureau of Economic Research  asked Friedman to rejoin the Bureau s staff  He accepted the invitation  and assumed responsibility for the Bureau s inquiry into the role of money in the business cycle  As a result  he initiated the  Workshop in Money and Banking   the  Chicago Workshop    which promoted a revival of monetary studies  During the latter half of the 1940s  Friedman began a collaboration with Anna Schwartz  an economic historian at the Bureau  that would ultimately result in the 1963 publication of a book co authored by Friedman and Schwartz  A Monetary History of the United States  1867 1960  Friedman spent the 1954 55 academic year as a Fulbright Visiting Fellow at Gonville and Caius College  Cambridge  At the time  the Cambridge economics faculty was divided into a Keynesian majority  including Joan Robinson and Richard Kahn  and an anti Keynesian minority  headed by Dennis Robertson   Friedman speculates that he was invited to the fellowship because his views were unacceptable to both of the Cambridge factions  Later his weekly columns for Newsweek magazine  1966 84  were well read and increasingly influential among political and business people  29  From 1968 to 1978  he and Paul Samuelson participated in the Economics Cassette Series  a biweekly subscription series where the economist would discuss the days  issues for about a half hour at a time  30  Friedman was an economic adviser to Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater during 1964   edit  Nobel memorial prize and retirement In 1976 Friedman won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics  for his achievements in the fields of consumption analysis  monetary history and theory and for his demonstration of the complexity of stabilization policy   1  During the banquet speech he made a reference to  the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel   In that he was the first recipient to do so  and it wasn t until 2006 that a recipient of the prize called it by its proper name  31  During 1977  at age 65  Friedman retired from the University of Chicago after teaching there for 30 years  He and his wife moved to San Francisco where he became a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco  From 1977 on  he was affiliated with the Hoover Institution at Stanford University  During the same year  Friedman was approached by the Free To Choose Network and asked to create a television program presenting his economic and social philosophy  The Friedmans worked on this project for the next three years  and during 1980  the ten part series  titled Free to Choose  was broadcast by the Public Broadcasting Service  PBS   The companion book to the series  co authored by Milton and his wife  Rose Friedman   also titled Free To Choose  was the bestselling nonfiction book of 1980 and has since been translated into 14 foreign languages  Friedman served as an unofficial adviser to Ronald Reagan during his 1980 presidential campaign  and then served on the President s Economic Policy Advisory Board for the rest of the Reagan Administration  During 1988  he received the National Medal of Science and Reagan honored him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom  Milton Friedman is known now as one of the most influential economists of the 20th century  32  33  Throughout the 1980s and 1990s  Friedman continued to write editorials and appear on television  He made several visits to Eastern Europe and to China  where he also advised governments   edit  Scholarly contributions See also  Friedman Savage utility function  Friedman rule  Friedman s k percent rule  and Friedman test  edit  Economics Friedman was best known for reviving interest in the money supply as a determinant of the nominal value of output  that is  the quantity theory of money  Monetarism is the set of views associated with modern quantity theory  Its origins can be traced back to the 16th century School of Salamanca or even further  however  Friedman s contribution is largely responsible for its modern popularization  He co authored  with Anna Schwartz  A Monetary History of the United States  1963   which was an examination of the role of the money supply and economic activity in U S  history  A striking conclusion of their research was one regarding the role of money supply fluctuations as contributing to economic fluctuations  Several regression studies with David Meiselman during the 1960s suggested the primacy of the money supply over investment and government spending in determining consumption and output  These challenged a prevailing but largely untested view on their relative importance  Friedman s empirical research and some theory supported the conclusion that the short run effect of a change of the money supply was primarily on output but that the longer run effect was primarily on the price level  Friedman was the main proponent of the monetarist school of economics  He maintained that there is a close and stable association between price inflation and the money supply  mainly that price inflation should be regulated with monetary deflation and price deflation with monetary inflation  He famously quipped that price deflation can be fought by  dropping money out of a helicopter   34  Friedman s arguments were designed to counter popular claims that price inflation at the time was the result of increases in the price of oil  or increases in wages  as he wrote  Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon   Milton Friedman  1963  35  Friedman rejected the use of fiscal policy as a tool of demand management  and he held that the government s role in the guidance of the economy should be restricted severely  Friedman wrote extensively on the Great Depression  which he termed the Great Contraction  arguing that it had been caused by an ordinary financial shock whose duration and seriousness were greatly increased by the subsequent contraction of the money supply caused by the misguided policies of the directors of the Federal Reserve  The Fed was largely responsible for converting what might have been a garden variety recession  although perhaps a fairly severe one  into a major catastrophe  Instead of using its powers to offset the depression  it presided over a decline in the quantity of money by one third from 1929 to 1933     Far from the depression being a failure of the free enterprise system  it was a tragic failure of government   Milton Friedman  Two Lucky People  233 Friedman also argued for the cessation of government intervention in currency markets  thereby spawning an enormous literature on the subject  as well as promoting the practice of freely floating exchange rates  His close friend George Stigler explained   As is customary in science  he did not win a full victory  in part because research was directed along different lines by the theory of rational expectations  a newer approach developed by Robert Lucas  also at the University of Chicago   36  Friedman was also known for his work on the consumption function  the permanent income hypothesis  1957   which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work  37  This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income  Windfall gains would mostly be saved  Tax reductions likewise  as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances  Other important contributions include his critique of the Phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment  1968   This critique associated his name  together with that of Edmund Phelps  with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so  Unemployment may be temporarily lower  if the inflation is a surprise  but in the long run unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market  Friedman s essay  The Methodology of Positive Economics   1953  provided the epistemological pattern for his own subsequent research and to a degree that of the Chicago School of Economics  There he argued that economics as science should be free of value judgments for it to be objective  Moreover  a useful economic theory should be judged not by its descriptive realism but by its simplicity and fruitfulness as an engine of prediction   edit  Statistics One of his most famous contributions to statistics is sequential sampling   Friedman did statistical work at the Division of War Research at Columbia  He and his colleagues came up with a sampling technique  known as sequential sampling  which became  in the words of The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics   the standard analysis of quality control inspection   The dictionary adds   Like many of Friedman s contributions  in retrospect it seems remarkably simple and obvious to apply basic economic ideas to quality control  that however is a measure of his genius    38   edit  Other work Friedman was an important member of the team during World War II that developed a new proximity fuse for anti aircraft projectiles  which prevented shells from exploding unless they were near the object they are meant to destroy  38   edit  Public policy positions Part of a series on Libertarianism Origins and history Aristotelianism Age of Enlightenment

Libertarianism portal Liberalism portal v t e  edit  Federal reserve Friedman believed that if the money supply was to be centrally controlled  as by the Federal Reserve  that the preferable way to do it would be with a mechanical system that would keep the quantity of money increasing at a steady rate  However  instead of government involvement at all  he was open to a  real   non government  gold standard where money is produced by the private market   A real gold standard is thoroughly consistent with  classical  liberal principles and I  for one  am entirely in favor of measures promoting its development   He did however add this caveat   Let me emphasize that this note is not a plea for a return to a gold standard     I regard a return to a gold standard as neither desirable nor feasible with the one exception that it might become feasible if the doomsday predictions of hyperinflation under our present system should prove correct   39  He said the reason that it was not feasible was because  there is essentially no government in the world that is willing to surrender control over its domestic monetary policy   However  it could be done if  you could re establish a world in which government s budget accounted for 10 percent of the national income  in which laissez faire reigned  in which governments did not interfere with economic activities and in which full employment policies had been relegated to the dustbin     39  He was critical of the Federal Reserve s influence on the economics profession  In a 1993 letter to University of Texas economics professor and former House Banking Committee investigator Robert Auerbach  Friedman wrote  I cannot disagree with you that having something like 500 economists is extremely unhealthy  As you say  it is not conducive to independent  objective research  You and I know there has been censorship of the material published  Equally important  the location of the economists in the Federal Reserve has had a significant influence on the kind of research they do  biasing that research toward noncontroversial technical papers on method as opposed to substantive papers on policy and results  40   edit  School choice In his 1955 article  The Role of Government in Education  Friedman proposed supplementing publicly operated schools with privately run but publicly funded schools through a system of school vouchers  41  Reforms similar to those proposed in the article were implemented in  for example  Chile in 1981 and Sweden in 1992  42  In 1996 Friedman  together with his wife  founded the The Foundation for Educational Choice to advocate school choice and vouchers   edit  Conscription Milton Friedman was a major proponent of a volunteer military  stating that the draft was  inconsistent with a free society   43  44  In Capitalism and Freedom  he argued that conscription is inequitable and arbitrary  preventing young men from shaping their lives as they see fit  45  During the Nixon administration he headed the committee to research a conversion to paid volunteer armed force  He would later state that his role in eliminating the conscription in the United States was his proudest accomplishment  9  Friedman did  however  believe a nation could compel military training as a reserve in case of war time  45   edit  Libertarianism and the Republican party He served as a member of President Reagan s Economic Policy Advisory Board during 1981  During 1988  he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Science  He said that he was a libertarian philosophically  but a member of the U S  Republican Party for the sake of  expediency    I am a libertarian with a small  l  and a Republican with a capital  R   And I am a Republican with a capital  R  on grounds of expediency  not on principle    But  he said   I think the term classical liberal is also equally applicable  I don t really care very much what I m called  I m much more interested in having people thinking about the ideas  rather than the person   46   edit  Public goods and monopoly Friedman was supportive of the state provision of some public goods that private businesses are not considered as being able to provide  However  he argued that many of the services performed by government could be performed better by the private sector  Above all  if some public goods are provided by the state  he believed that they should not be a legal monopoly where private competition is prohibited  for example  he wrote  There is no way to justify our present public monopoly of the post office  It may be argued that the carrying of mail is a technical monopoly and that a government monopoly is the least of evils  Along these lines  one could perhaps justify a government post office  but not the present law  which makes it illegal for anybody else to carry the mail  If the delivery of mail is a technical monopoly  no one else will be able to succeed in competition with the government  If it is not  there is no reason why the government should be engaged in it  The only way to find out is to leave other people free to enter   Milton Friedman  Friedman  Milton  amp  Rose D  Capitalism and Freedom  University of Chicago Press  1982  29  edit  Welfare Friedman made newspaper headlines by proposing a negative income tax to replace the existing welfare system  and then opposing a bill to implement it because the bill proposed to supplement the existing system rather than replace it   edit  Drugs Friedman also supported libertarian policies such as legalization of drugs and prostitution  During 2005  Friedman and more than 500 other economists advocated discussions regarding the economic benefits of the legalization of marijuana  47   edit  Economic freedom Michael Walker of the Fraser Institute and Friedman hosted a series of conferences from 1986 to 1994  The goal was to create a clear definition of economic freedom and a method for measuring it  Eventually this resulted in the first report on worldwide economic freedom  Economic Freedom in the World  This annual report has since provided data for numerous peer reviewed studies and has influenced policy in several nations  Along with sixteen other distinguished economists he opposed the Copyright Term Extension Act and filed an amicus brief in Eldred v  Ashcroft  48  He supported the inclusion of the word  no brainer  in the brief  49  Friedman argued for stronger basic legal  constitutional  protection of economic rights and freedoms in order to further promote industrial commercial growth and prosperity and buttress democracy and freedom and the rule of law generally in society  50   edit  Honors  recognition  and influence Friedman allowed the Cato Institute to use his name for its biannual Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty beginning in 2001  A Friedman Prize was given to the late British economist Peter Bauer during 2002  Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto during 2004  Mart Laar  former Estonian Prime Minister during 2006 and a young Venezuelan student Yon Goicoechea during 2008  His wife Rose  sister of Aaron Director  with whom he initiated the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice  served on the international selection committee  Friedman was also a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics   edit  Hong Kong Friedman once said   If you want to see capitalism in action  go to Hong Kong   51  He wrote in 1990 that the Hong Kong economy was perhaps the best example of a free market economy  52  One month before his death  he wrote the article  Hong Kong Wrong   What would Cowperthwaite say   in the Wall Street Journal  criticizing Donald Tsang  the Chief Executive of Hong Kong  for abandoning  positive noninterventionism   53  Tsang later said he was merely changing the slogan to  big market  small government   where small government is defined as less than 20  of GDP  In a debate between Tsang and his rival  Alan Leong  before the 2007 Chief Executive election  Leong introduced the topic and jokingly accused Tsang of angering Friedman to death   edit  Chile Main articles  Miracle of Chile and Chicago Boys During 1975  two years after the military coup that ended the government of Salvador Allende  the economy of Chile experienced a crisis  Friedman accepted the invitation of a private foundation to visit Chile and speak on principles of economic freedom  He spent seven days in Chile giving a series of lectures  One of the lectures was entitled  The Fragility of Freedom   and according to Friedman   dealt with precisely the threat to freedom from a centralized military government   54  Friedman encapsulated his philosophy in a lecture at Universidad Cat lica de Chile  saying   free markets would undermine political centralization and political control   55  Friedman also met with military dictator President Augusto Pinochet during his visit  He never served as an adviser to the Chilean government  but did write a letter to Pinochet outlining what Friedman considered the two key economic problems of Chile  The letter listed a series of monetary and fiscal measures deemed a  shock program  to end hyperinflation and promote a market economy  56  His letter suggested  among other  more specific prescriptions  that a brief period of cutting government spending would reduce its fiscal deficit and thus reduce the rate of increase of the quantity of money in the country that was driving inflation  The economist did however admit his knowledge of Chile was  too limited to enable  him  to be precise or comprehensive  and that the measures he outlined were  to be taken as illustrative   56  Friedman felt that there might be a brief period   measured in months   of higher unemployment  followed by recovery once inflation was tamed  His letter also suggested that cutting spending to reduce the fiscal deficit would result in less transitional unemployment than raising taxes to do so  Later  Friedman said he believed that market reforms would undermine Pinochet  57  Chilean graduates of the Chicago School of Economics and its new local chapters had been appointed to important positions in the new government soon after the coup  which allowed them to advise Pinochet on economic policies in accord with the School s economic doctrine  According to his critics  Friedman did not criticize Pinochet s dictatorship at the time  nor the assassinations  illegal imprisonments  torture  or other atrocities that were well known by then  58  In his 1980 documentary Free to Choose  he said the following   Chile is not a politically free system  and I do not condone the system  But the people there are freer than the people in Communist societies because government plays a smaller role      The conditions of the people in the past few years has been getting better and not worse  They would be still better to get rid of the junta and to be able to have a free democratic system   59  60  In 1984 Friedman proclaimed he has  never refrained from criticizing the political system in Chile   54  Friedman defended his activity in Chile on the grounds that  in his opinion  the adoption of free market policies not only improved the economic situation of Chile but also contributed to the amelioration of Pinochet s rule and to the eventual transition to a democratic government during 1990  That idea is included in Capitalism and Freedom  in which he declared that economic freedom is not only desirable in itself but is also a necessary condition for political freedom  He stressed that the lectures he gave in Chile were the same lectures he later gave in China and other socialist states  61  During the 2000 PBS documentary The Commanding Heights  based on the book   Friedman continued to argue that criticism over his role in Chile missed his main contention that freer markets resulted in freer people  and that Chile s unfree economy had caused the military government  Friedman suggested that the economic liberalization he advocated caused the end of military rule and a free Chile  62   edit  Iceland Friedman visited Iceland during the autumn of 1984  met with important Icelanders and gave a lecture at the University of Iceland on the  tyranny of the status quo   He participated in a lively television debate on August 31  1984 with socialist intellectuals  including  lafur Ragnar Gr msson  who later became the president of Iceland  63  When they complained that a fee was charged for attending his lecture at the University and that hitherto  lectures by visiting scholars had been free of charge  Friedman replied that previous lectures had not been free of charge in a meaningful sense  Lectures always have related costs  What mattered was whether attendees or non attendees covered those costs  Friedman thought that it was fairer that only those who attended paid  In this discussion Friedman also stated that he did not receive any money for delivering that lecture   edit  Estonia Although Friedman never visited Estonia  his book Free to Choose exercised a great influence on that nation s then 32 year old prime minister  Mart Laar  who has claimed that it was the only book on economics he had read before taking office  Laar s reforms are often credited with responsibility for transforming Estonia from an impoverished Soviet Republic to the  Baltic Tiger   A prime element of Laar s program was introduction of the flat tax  Laar won the 2006 Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty  awarded by the Cato Institute  64   edit  United Kingdom Milton Friedman influenced the thinking of Alan Walters and Patrick Minford  two of Margaret Thatcher s main macroeconomic advisers  See the book Margaret Thatcher s Revolution  How it Happened and What it Meant  edited by Subroto Roy  amp  John Clarke  Continuum 2005  edit  Criticism  edit  Keynesian criticism During the financial crisis of 2007 2010  several Keynesian economists such as James Galbraith and Joseph Stiglitz blamed the free market philosophy of Friedman and the Chicago school for the economic turmoil  65  After Friedman s death in 2006  Keynesian Nobel laureate Paul Krugman  praised Friedman as a  great economist and a great man   but criticized him by writing that  he slipped all too easily into claiming both that markets always work and that only markets work  It s extremely hard to find cases in which Friedman acknowledged the possibility that markets could go wrong  or that government intervention could serve a useful purpose   66   edit  Austrian school criticism In 1971  libertarian economist Murray Rothbard criticized Friedman s efforts to make the government more efficient as detrimental to individual liberty  concluding     as we examine Milton Friedman s credentials to be the leader of free market economics  we arrive at the chilling conclusion that it is difficult to consider him a free market economist at all   67  Friedman s position on governmental control of money changed since 1971 when this criticism was made  68  In a 1995 interview in Reason magazine he said the  difference between me and people like Murray Rothbard is that  though I want to know what my ideal is  I think I also have to be willing to discuss changes that are less than ideal so long as they point me in that direction   He said he actually would  like to abolish the Fed   and points out that when he has written about the Fed it is simply his recommendations of how it should be run given that it exists  9   edit  Other criticism In her book The Shock Doctrine  The Rise of Disaster Capitalism  journalist and author Naomi Klein criticized Friedman s ideology and the principles that guided the economic restructuring that followed the military coups in countries such as Chile and Indonesia  drawing analogies between the way that Friedman proposed using the social  shock  of the coups to create an economic  blank slate  with Ewen Cameron s controversial medical experiments that used electroshock therapy to create a mental  blank slate  in patients with mental disorders  69  Based on the extent to which the application of neoliberal policies has contributed to income disparities and inequality  70  both Klein and Noam Chomsky have suggested that the primary role of neoliberalism was as an ideological cover for capital accumulation by multinational corporations  71  Chilean economist Orlando Letelier asserted that Pinochet s dictatorship resorted to oppression because of popular opposition to Chicago School policies in Chile  72   edit  Personal life According to a 2007 article in Commentary magazine  his  parents were moderately observant  Jews   but Friedman  after an intense burst of childhood piety  rejected religion altogether   73  He described himself as an agnostic  74  Friedman wrote extensively of his life and experiences  especially in 1998 in his memoirs with his wife Rose  titled Two Lucky People  He died of heart failure at the age of 94 years in San Francisco on November 16  2006  75  76  He was survived by his wife  who died on August 18  2009  and their two children  David  who is a philosopher and anarcho capitalist economist  and Janet  David s son  Patri Friedman  is the executive director of the Seasteading Institute  77   edit  See
