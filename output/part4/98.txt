of a corporation Corporate governance is  the system by which companies are directed and controlled   Cadbury Committee  1992   1  It involves a set of relationships between a company s management  its board  its shareholders and other stakeholders  it deals with prevention or mitigation of the conflict of interests of stakeholders  2  Ways of mitigating or preventing these conflicts of interests include the processes  customs  policies  laws  and institutions which have impact on the way a company is controlled  3  4  An important theme of corporate governance is the nature and extent of accountability of people in the business  and mechanisms that try to decrease the principal agent problem  5  Corporate governance also includes the relationships among the many stakeholders involved and the goals for which the corporation is governed  6  7  In contemporary business corporations  the main external stakeholder groups are shareholders  debtholders  trade creditors  suppliers  customers and communities affected by the corporation s activities  Internal stakeholders are the board of directors  executives  and other employees  It guarantees that an enterprise is directed and controlled in a responsible  professional  and transparent manner with the purpose of safeguarding its long term success  It is intended to increase the confidence of shareholders and capital market investors   8  A related but separate thread of discussions focuses on the impact of a corporate governance system on economic efficiency  with a strong emphasis on shareholders  welfare  this aspect is particularly present in contemporary public debates and developments in regulatory policy  see regulation and policy regulation   9  There has been renewed interest in the corporate governance practices of modern corporations since 2001  particularly due to the high profile collapses of a number of large corporations  most of which involved accounting fraud  Corporate scandals of various forms have maintained public and political interest in the regulation of corporate governance  In the U S   these include Enron Corporation and MCI Inc   formerly WorldCom   Their demise is associated with the U S  federal government passing the Sarbanes Oxley Act in 2002  intending to restore public confidence in corporate governance  Comparable failures in Australia  HIH  One Tel  are associated with the eventual passage of the CLERP 9 reforms  Similar corporate failures in other countries stimulated increased regulatory interest  e g   Parmalat in Italy   Contents 1

released since 1990  The Cadbury Report  UK  1992   the Principles of Corporate Governance  OECD  1998 and 2004   the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002  US  2002   The Cadbury and OECD reports present general principals around which businesses are expected to operate to assure proper governance  The Sarbanes Oxley Act  informally referred to as Sarbox or Sox  is an attempt by the federal government in the United States to legislate several of the principles recommended in the Cadbury and OECD reports  Rights and equitable treatment of shareholders  10  11  12  Organizations should respect the rights of shareholders and help shareholders to exercise those rights  They can help shareholders exercise their rights by openly and effectively communicating information and by encouraging shareholders to participate in general meetings  Interests of other stakeholders  13  Organizations should recognize that they have legal  contractual  social  and market driven obligations to non shareholder stakeholders  including employees  investors  creditors  suppliers  local communities  customers  and policy makers  Role and responsibilities of the board  14  15  The board needs sufficient relevant skills and understanding to review and challenge management performance  It also needs adequate size and appropriate levels of independence and commitment Integrity and ethical behavior  16  17  Integrity should be a fundamental requirement in choosing corporate officers and board members  Organizations should develop a code of conduct for their directors and executives that promotes ethical and responsible decision making  Disclosure and transparency  18  19  Organizations should clarify and make publicly known the roles and responsibilities of board and management to provide stakeholders with a level of accountability  They should also implement procedures to independently verify and safeguard the integrity of the company s financial reporting  Disclosure of material matters concerning the organization should be timely and balanced to ensure that all investors have access to clear  factual information   edit  Corporate governance models around the world There are many different models of corporate governance around the world  These differ according to the variety of capitalism in which they are embedded  The Anglo American  model  tends to emphasize the interests of shareholders  The coordinated or multi stakeholder model associated with Continental Europe and Japan also recognizes the interests of workers  managers  suppliers  customers  and the community   edit  Continental Europe Some continental European countries  including Germany and the Netherlands  require a two tiered Board of Directors as a means of improving corporate governance  20  In the two tiered board  the Executive Board  made up of company executives  generally runs day to day operations while the supervisory board  made up entirely of non executive directors who represent shareholders and employees  hires and fires the members of the executive board  determines their compensation  and reviews major business decisions  21  See also Aktiengesellschaft   edit  India India s SEBI Committee on Corporate Governance defines corporate governance as the  acceptance by management of the inalienable rights of shareholders as the true owners of the corporation and of their own role as trustees on behalf of the shareholders  It is about commitment to values  about ethical business conduct and about making a distinction between personal  amp  corporate funds in the management of a company   22  It has been suggested that the Indian approach is drawn from the Gandhian principle of trusteeship and the Directive Principles of the Indian Constitution  but this conceptualization of corporate objectives is also prevalent in Anglo American and most other jurisdictions   edit  The United States and the UK The so called  Anglo American model   also known as  the unitary system  23   emphasizes a single tiered Board of Directors composed of a mixture of executives from the company and non executive directors  all of whom are elected by shareholders  24  Non executive directors are expected to outnumber executive directors and hold key posts  including audit and compensation committees  The United States and the United Kingdom differ in one critical respect with regard to corporate governance  In the United Kingdom  the CEO generally does not also serve as Chairman of the Board  whereas in the US having the dual role is the norm  despite major misgivings regarding the impact on corporate governance  25  In the United States  corporations are directly governed by state laws  while the exchange  offering and trading  of securities in corporations  including shares  is governed by federal legislation  Many U S  states have adopted the Model Business Corporation Act  but the dominant state law for publicly traded corporations is Delaware  which continues to be the place of incorporation for the majority of publicly traded corporations  26  Individual rules for corporations are based upon the corporate charter and  less authoritatively  the corporate bylaws  26  Shareholders cannot initiate changes in the corporate charter although they can initiate changes to the corporate bylaws  26   edit  Regulation Companies law

Contract v t e  edit  Legal environment   General Corporations are created as legal persons by the laws and regulations of a particular jurisdiction  These may vary in many respects between countries  but a corporation s legal person status is fundamental to all jurisdictions and is conferred by statute  This allows the entity to hold property in its own right without reference to any particular real person  It also results in the perpetual existence that characterizes the modern corporation  The statutory granting of corporate existence may arise from general purpose legislation  which is the general case  or from a statute to create a specific corporation  which was the only method prior to the 19th century  In addition to the statutory laws of the relevant jurisdiction  corporations are subject to common law in some countries  and various laws and regulations affecting business practices  In most jurisdictions  corporations also have a constitution that provides individual rules that govern the corporation and authorize or constrain its decision makers  This constitution is identified by a variety of terms  in English speaking jurisdictions  it is usually known as the Corporate Charter or the  Memorandum and  Articles of Association  The capacity of shareholders to modify the constitution of their corporation can vary substantially   edit  Codes and guidelines Corporate governance principles and codes have been developed in different countries and issued from stock exchanges  corporations  institutional investors  or associations  institutes  of directors and managers with the support of governments and international organizations  As a rule  compliance with these governance recommendations is not mandated by law  although the codes linked to stock exchange listing requirements may have a coercive effect  For example  companies quoted on the London  Toronto and Australian Stock Exchanges formally need not follow the recommendations of their respective codes  However  they must disclose whether they follow the recommendations in those documents and  where not  they should provide explanations concerning divergent practices  Such disclosure requirements exert a significant pressure on listed companies for compliance  One of the most influential guidelines has been the 1999 OECD Principles of Corporate Governance  This was revised in 2004  The OECD guidelines are often referenced by countries developing local codes or guidelines  Building on the work of the OECD  other international organizations  private sector associations and more than 20 national corporate governance codes  the United Nations Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting  ISAR  has produced their Guidance on Good Practices in Corporate Governance Disclosure  This internationally agreed 27  benchmark consists of more than fifty distinct disclosure items across five broad categories  28  Auditing Board and management structure and process Corporate responsibility and compliance Financial transparency and information disclosure Ownership structure and exercise of control rights The investor led organisation International Corporate Governance Network  ICGN  was set up by individuals centered around the ten largest pension funds in the world 1995  The aim is to promote global corporate governance standards  The network is led by investors that manage 18 trillion dollars and members are located in fifty different countries  ICGN has developed a suite of global guidelines ranging from shareholder rights to business ethics  The World Business Council for Sustainable Development  WBCSD  has done work on corporate governance  particularly on accountability and reporting  and in 2004 released Issue Management Tool  Strategic challenges for business in the use of corporate responsibility codes  standards  and frameworks  This document offers general information and a perspective from a business association think tank on a few key codes  standards and frameworks relevant to the sustainability agenda  In 2009  the International Finance Corporation and the UN Global Compact released a report  Corporate Governance   the Foundation for Corporate Citizenship and Sustainable Business  linking the environmental  social and governance responsibilities of a company to its financial performance and long term sustainability  Most codes are largely voluntary  An issue raised in the U S  since the 2005 Disney decision 29  is the degree to which companies manage their governance responsibilities  in other words  do they merely try to supersede the legal threshold  or should they create governance guidelines that ascend to the level of best practice  For example  the guidelines issued by associations of directors  corporate managers and individual companies tend to be wholly voluntary but such documents may have a wider effect by prompting other companies to adopt similar practices   edit  History   United States In 19th century United States  state corporation laws enhanced the rights of corporate boards to govern without unanimous consent of shareholders in exchange for statutory benefits like appraisal rights  to make corporate governance more efficient  Since that time  and because most large publicly traded corporations in the US are incorporated under corporate administration friendly Delaware law  and because the US s wealth has been increasingly securitized into various corporate entities and institutions  the rights of individual owners and shareholders have become increasingly derivative and dissipated  In the 20th century in the immediate aftermath of the Wall Street Crash of 1929 legal scholars such as Adolf Augustus Berle  Edwin Dodd  and Gardiner C  Means pondered on the changing role of the modern corporation in society  Berle and Means  monograph  The Modern Corporation and Private Property   1932  Macmillan  continues to have a profound influence on the conception of corporate governance in scholarly debates today  From the Chicago school of economics  Ronald Coase s  The Nature of the Firm   1937  introduced the notion of transaction costs into the understanding of why firms are founded and how they continue to behave  Fifty years later  Eugene Fama and Michael Jensen s  The Separation of Ownership and Control   1983  Journal of Law and Economics  firmly established agency theory as a way of understanding corporate governance  the firm is seen as a series of contracts  Agency theory s dominance was highlighted in a 1989 article by Kathleen Eisenhardt   Agency theory  an assessment and review   Academy of Management Review   US expansion after World War II through the emergence of multinational corporations saw the establishment of the managerial class  Accordingly  the following Harvard Business School management professors published influential monographs studying their prominence  Myles Mace  entrepreneurship   Alfred D  Chandler  Jr   business history   Jay Lorsch  organizational behavior  and Elizabeth MacIver  organizational behavior   According to Lorsch and MacIver  many large corporations have dominant control over business affairs without sufficient accountability or monitoring by their board of directors   Over the past three decades  corporate directors  duties in the U S  have expanded beyond their traditional legal responsibility of duty of loyalty to the corporation and its shareholders  30  In the first half of the 1990s  the issue of corporate governance in the U S  received considerable press attention due to the wave of CEO dismissals  e g   IBM  Kodak  Honeywell  by their boards  The California Public Employees  Retirement System  CalPERS  led a wave of institutional shareholder activism  something only very rarely seen before   as a way of ensuring that corporate value would not be destroyed by the now traditionally cozy relationships between the CEO and the board of directors  e g   by the unrestrained issuance of stock options  not infrequently back dated   In 1997  the East Asian Financial Crisis severely affected the economies of Thailand  Indonesia  South Korea  Malaysia  and the Philippines through the exit of foreign capital after property assets collapsed  The lack of corporate governance mechanisms in these countries highlighted the weaknesses of the institutions in their economies  In the early 2000s  the massive bankruptcies  and criminal malfeasance  of Enron and Worldcom  as well as lesser corporate scandals  such as Adelphia Communications  AOL  Arthur Andersen  Global Crossing  Tyco  led to increased political interest in corporate governance  This is reflected in the passage of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002   edit  Parties to corporate governance The most influential parties involved in corporate governance include government agencies and authorities  stock exchanges  management  including the board of directors and its chair  the Chief Executive Officer or the equivalent  other executives and line management  shareholders and auditors   Other influential stakeholders may include lenders  suppliers  employees  creditors  customers and the community at large  The agency view of the corporation posits that the shareholder forgoes decision rights  control  and entrusts the manager to act in the shareholders  best  joint  interests  Partly as a result of this separation between the two investors and managers  corporate governance mechanisms include a system of controls intended to help align managers  incentives with those of shareholders  Agency concerns  risk  are necessarily lower for a controlling shareholder  A board of directors is expected to play a key role in corporate governance  The board has the responsibility of endorsing the organization s strategy  developing directional policy  appointing  supervising and remunerating senior executives  and ensuring accountability of the organization to its investors and authorities  All parties to corporate governance have an interest  whether direct or indirect  in the financial performance of the corporation  Directors  workers and management receive salaries  benefits and reputation  while investors expect to receive financial returns  For lenders  it is specified interest payments  while returns to equity investors arise from dividend distributions or capital gains on their stock  Customers are concerned with the certainty of the provision of goods and services of an appropriate quality  suppliers are concerned with compensation for their goods or services  and possible continued trading relationships  These parties provide value to the corporation in the form of financial  physical  human and other forms of capital  Many parties may also be concerned with corporate social performance  A key factor in a party s decision to participate in or engage with a corporation is their confidence that the corporation will deliver the party s expected outcomes  When categories of parties  stakeholders  do not have sufficient confidence that a corporation is being controlled and directed in a manner consistent with their desired outcomes  they are less likely to engage with the corporation  When this becomes an endemic system feature  the loss of confidence and participation in markets may affect many other stakeholders  and increases the likelihood of political action  There is substantial interest in how external systems and institutions  including markets  influence corporate governance   edit  Control and ownership structures Control and ownership structure refers to the types and composition of shareholders in a corporation  In some countries such as most of Continental Europe  ownership is not necessarily equivalent to control due to the existence of e g  dual class shares  ownership pyramids  voting coalitions  proxy votes and clauses in the articles of association that confer additional voting rights to long term shareholders  31  Ownership is typically defined as the ownership of cash flow rights whereas control refers to ownership of control or voting rights  32  Researchers often  measure  control and ownership structures by using some observable measures of control and ownership concentration or the extent of inside control and ownership  Some features or types of control and ownership structure involving corporate groups include pyramids  cross shareholdings  rings  and webs  German  concerns   Konzern  are legally recognized corporate groups with complex structures  Japanese keiretsu      and South Korean chaebol  which tend to be family controlled  are corporate groups which consist of complex interlocking business relationships and shareholdings  Cross shareholding are an essential feature of keiretsu and chaebol groups  4   Corporate engagement with shareholders and other stakeholders can differ substantially across different control and ownership structures   edit  Family control In many jurisdictions  family interests dominate ownership and control structures  It is sometimes suggested that corporations controlled by family interests are subject to superior oversight compared to corporations  controlled  by institutional investors  or with such diverse share ownership that they are controlled by management   A recent study by Credit Suisse found that companies in which  founding families retain a stake of more than 10  of the company s capital enjoyed a superior performance over their respective sectorial peers   Since 1996  this superior performance amounts to 8  per year  33  Forget the celebrity CEO   Look beyond Six Sigma and the latest technology fad  A study by Business Week 34  claims that  BW identified five key ingredients that contribute to superior performance  Not all are qualities are unique to enterprises with retained family interests   The significance of institutional investors varies substantially across countries  In developed Anglo American countries  Australia  Canada  New Zealand  U K   U S    institutional investors dominate the market for stocks in larger corporations  While the majority of the shares in the Japanese market are held by financial companies and industrial corporations  these are not institutional investors if their holdings are largely with on group  The largest pools of invested money  such as the mutual fund  Vanguard 500   or the largest investment management firm for corporations  State Street Corp   are designed to maximize the benefits of diversified investment by investing in a very large number of different corporations with sufficient liquidity  The idea is this strategy will largely eliminate individual firm financial or other risk and  A consequence of this approach is that these investors have relatively little interest in the governance of a particular corporation  It is often assumed that  if institutional investors pressing for will likely be costly because of  golden handshakes   or the effort required  they will simply sell out their interest   edit  Mechanisms and controls Corporate governance mechanisms and controls are designed to reduce the inefficiencies that arise from moral hazard and adverse selection  For example  to monitor managers  behavior  an independent third party  the external auditor  attests the accuracy of information provided by management to investors  An ideal control system should regulate both motivation and ability   edit  Internal corporate governance controls Internal corporate governance controls monitor activities and then take corrective action to accomplish organisational goals  Examples include  Monitoring by the board of directors  The board of directors  with its legal authority to hire  fire and compensate top management  safeguards invested capital  Regular board meetings allow potential problems to be identified  discussed and avoided  Whilst non executive directors are thought to be more independent  they may not always result in more effective corporate governance and may not increase performance  35  Different board structures are optimal for different firms  Moreover  the ability of the board to monitor the firm s executives is a function of its access to information  Executive directors possess superior knowledge of the decision making process and therefore evaluate top management on the basis of the quality of its decisions that lead to financial performance outcomes  ex ante  It could be argued  therefore  that executive directors look beyond the financial criteria  Internal control procedures and internal auditors  Internal control procedures are policies implemented by an entity s board of directors  audit committee  management  and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance of the entity achieving its objectives related to reliable financial reporting  operating efficiency  and compliance with laws and regulations  Internal auditors are personnel within an organization who test the design and implementation of the entity s internal control procedures and the reliability of its financial reporting Balance of power  The simplest balance of power is very common  require that the President be a different person from the Treasurer  This application of separation of power is further developed in companies where separate divisions check and balance each other s actions  One group may propose company wide administrative changes  another group review and can veto the changes  and a third group check that the interests of people  customers  shareholders  employees  outside the three groups are being met  Remuneration  Performance based remuneration is designed to relate some proportion of salary to individual performance  It may be in the form of cash or non cash payments such as shares and share options  superannuation or other benefits  Such incentive schemes  however  are reactive in the sense that they provide no mechanism for preventing mistakes or opportunistic behavior  and can elicit myopic behavior  Monitoring by large shareholders and or monitoring by banks and other large creditors  Given their large investment in the firm  these stakeholders have the incentives  combined with the right degree of control and power  to monitor the management  36  In publicly traded U S  corporations  boards of directors are largely chosen by the President CEO and the President CEO often takes the Chair of the Board position for his herself  which makes it much more difficult for the institutional owners to  fire  him her   The practice of the CEO also being the Chair of the Board is known as  duality   While this practice is common in the U S   it is relatively rare elsewhere  In the U K   successive codes of best practice have recommended against duality   edit  External corporate governance controls External corporate governance controls encompass the controls external stakeholders exercise over the organization  Examples include  competition debt covenants demand for and assessment of performance information  especially financial statements  government regulations managerial labour market media pressure takeovers  edit  Financial reporting and the independent auditor The board of directors has primary responsibility for the corporation s external financial reporting functions  The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are crucial participants and boards usually have a high degree of reliance on them for the integrity and supply of accounting information  They oversee the internal accounting systems  and are dependent on the corporation saccountants and internal auditors  Current accounting rules under International Accounting Standards and U S  GAAP allow managers some choice in determining the methods of measurement and criteria for recognition of various financial reporting elements  The potential exercise of this choice to improve apparent performance  see creative accounting and earnings management  increases the information risk for users  Financial reporting fraud  including non disclosure and deliberate falsification of values also contributes to users  information risk  To reduce these risk and to enhance the perceived integrity of financial reports  corporation financial reports must be audited by an independent external auditor who issues a report that accompanies the financial statements  see financial audit   It is One area of concern is whether the auditing firm acts as both the independent auditor and management consultant to the firm they are auditing  This may result in a conflict of interest which places the integrity of financial reports in doubt due to client pressure to appease management  The power of the corporate client to initiate and terminate management consulting services and  more fundamentally  to select and dismiss accounting firms contradicts the concept of an independent auditor  Changes enacted in the United States in the form of the Sarbanes Oxley Act  following numerous corporate scandals  culminating with the Enron scandal  prohibit accounting firms from providing both auditing and management consulting services  Similar provisions are in place under clause 49 of Standard Listing Agreement in India   edit  Systemic problems of corporate governance Demand for information  In order to influence the directors  the shareholders must combine with others to form a voting group which can pose a real threat of carrying resolutions or appointing directors at a general meeting  Monitoring costs  A barrier to shareholders using good information is the cost of processing it  especially to a small shareholder  The traditional answer to this problem is the efficient market hypothesis  in finance  the efficient market hypothesis  EMH  asserts that financial markets are efficient   which suggests that the small shareholder will free ride on the judgments of larger professional investors  Supply of accounting information  Financial accounts form a crucial link in enabling providers of finance to monitor directors  Imperfections in the financial reporting process will cause imperfections in the effectiveness of corporate governance  This should  ideally  be corrected by the working of the external auditing process   edit  Executive remuneration compensation Research on the relationship between firm performance and executive compensation does not identify consistent and significant relationships between executives  remuneration and firm performance  Not all firms experience the same levels of agency conflict  and external and internal monitoring devices may be more effective for some than for others  Some researchers have found that the largest CEO performance incentives came from ownership of the firm s shares  while other researchers found that the relationship between share ownership and firm performance was dependent on the level of ownership  The results suggest that increases in ownership above 20  cause management to become more entrenched  and less interested in the welfare of their shareholders  Some argue that firm performance is positively associated with share option plans and that these plans direct managers  energies and extend their decision horizons toward the long term  rather than the short term  performance of the company  However  that point of view came under substantial criticism circa in the wake of various security scandals including mutual fund timing episodes and  in particular  the backdating of option grants as documented by University of Iowa academic Erik Lie and reported by James Blander and Charles Forelle of the Wall Street Journal  Even before the negative influence on public opinion caused by the 2006 backdating scandal  use of options faced various criticisms  A particularly forceful and long running argument concerned the interaction of executive options with corporate stock repurchase programs  Numerous authorities  including U S  Federal Reserve Board economist Weisbenner  determined options may be employed in concert with stock buybacks in a manner contrary to shareholder interests  These authors argued that  in part  corporate stock buybacks for U S  Standard  amp  Poors 500 companies surged to a  500 billion annual rate in late 2006 because of the impact of options  A compendium of academic works on the option buyback issue is included in the study Scandal by author M  Gumport issued in 2006  A combination of accounting changes and governance issues led options to become a less popular means of remuneration as 2006 progressed  and various alternative implementations of buybacks surfaced to challenge the dominance of  open market  cash buybacks as the preferred means of implementing a share repurchase plan   edit
