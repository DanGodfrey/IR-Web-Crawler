 Malay  Negara Brunei Darussalam  Jawi                          is a sovereign state located on the north coast of the island of Borneo  in Southeast Asia  Apart from its coastline with the South China Sea  it is completely surrounded by the state of Sarawak  Malaysia  and it is separated into two parts by Limbang  which is part of Sarawak  It is the only sovereign state completely on the island of Borneo  with the remainder of the island belonging to Malaysia and Indonesia  Brunei s population was 401 890 in July 2011  9  The official national history claims that Brunei can trace its beginnings to the 7th century  when it was a subject state of the Srivijayan empire under the name P o li  It later became a vassal state of Majapahit empire before converting to Islam in the 15th century  At the peak of its empire  the sultanate had control that extended over the coastal regions of modern day Sarawak and Sabah  the Sulu archipelago  and the islands off the northwest tip of Borneo  The thalassocracy was visited by Ferdinand Magellan in 1521 and fought the Castille War in 1578 against Spain  Its empire began to decline with the forced ceding of Sarawak to James Brooke and the ceding of Sabah to the British North Borneo Chartered Company  After the loss of Limbang  Brunei finally became a British protectorate in 1888  receiving a resident in 1906  In the years after the Japanese wartime occupation during World War II  it formalised a constitution and fought an armed rebellion  10  Brunei regained its independence from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984  Economic growth during the 1970s and 1990s  averaging 56  from 1999 to 2008  has transformed Brunei Darussalam into a newly industrialised country  Brunei has the second highest Human Development Index among the South East Asia nations after Singapore  and is classified as a developed country  11  According to the International Monetary Fund  IMF   Brunei is ranked 5th in the world by gross domestic product per capita at purchasing power parity  Forbes also ranks Brunei as the fifth richest nation out of 182 nations due to its extensive petroleum and natural gas fields  12  Contents 1 Etymology 2

Alak Betatar  His move from Garang  a place in the Temburong District 13  to the Brunei river estuary led to the discovery of Brunei  According to legend  upon landing he exclaimed  Baru nah    loosely translating as  that s it   or  there    from which the name Brunei was derived  14  It was renamed Barunai in the 14th century  possibly influenced by the Sanskrit word varu          meaning either  ocean  or mythological  regent of ocean   The word Borneo is of the same origin  In the country s full name Negara Brunei Darussalam  Darussalam  Arabic               means  Abode of Peace   while Negara means  country  in Malay   edit  History Main article  History of Brunei  edit  Early History In the absence of any other evidence scholars have created an early history of Brunei that is mainly based on flexible interpretations of Chinese texts  This early part reads  Chinese records from the sixth century mention a state called P o li on the northwest coast of Borneo  15  In the seventh century  Chinese and Arab accounts state a place called Vijayapura  which was thought to be founded by members of the royal family of Funan  16  They were believed to have landed on the northwest coast of Borneo with some of their followers  They then captured P o li and renamed the territory  Vijayapura   meaning  victory    In 977  Chinese records started to use Po ni instead of Vijayapura to refer to Brunei  17  In 1225 a Chinese official named Chua Ju Kua reported that Brunei has 100 warships to protect its trade and that there was a lot of gold in the kingdom  18  Another report in 1280 described Po ni as controlling large parts of Borneo Island  modern day Sabah and Sarawak  Sulu and some parts of the Philippines  In the fourteenth century  Po ni became a vassal state of Majapahit  and had to pay an annual payment of 40 katis of camphor  Po ni was attacked and looted of its treasure and gold by the Sulus in 1369  A fleet from Majapahit succeeded in driving away the Sulus but Po ni became much weaker after the attack  19  A Chinese report of 1371 described Po ni as poor and totally controlled by Majapahit  20  The power of the Sultanate of Brunei was at its peak between the 15th and 17th centuries  with its power extending from northern Borneo to the southern Philippines  4  By the 16th century  Islam was firmly rooted in Brunei  and the country had built one of its biggest mosques  In 1578  Alonso Beltr n  a Spanish traveler described it as being five stories tall and built on the water  21   edit  War with Spain and decline European influence gradually brought an end to this regional power  as Brunei entered a period of decline compounded by internal strife over royal succession  Piracy was also detrimental to the kingdom  4  Spain declared it war in 1578  attacking and capturing Brunei s capital at the time  Kota Batu  This was achieved as a result in part of the assistance rendered to them by two Bruneian noblemen  Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna  The former had travelled to Manila to offer Brunei as a tributary of Spain for help to recover the throne usurped by his brother  Saiful Rijal  22  The Spanish agreed that if they succeeded in conquering Brunei  Pengiran Seri Lela would indeed become the Sultan  while Pengiran Seri Ratna would be the new Bendahara  In March 1578  the Spanish fleet  led by De Sande himself  acting as Capit n General  started their journey towards Brunei  The expedition consisted of 400 Spaniards  1 500 Filipino natives and 300 Borneans  23  The campaign was one of many  which also included action in Mindanao and Sulu  24  25  The Spanish succeeded in invading the capital on 16 April 1578  with the help of Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna  The Sultan Saiful Rijal and Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Abdul Kahar were forced to flee to Meragang then to Jerudong  In Jerudong  they made plans to chase the conquering army away from Brunei  The Spanish suffered heavy losses due to a cholera or dysentery outbreak  26  27  They were so weakened by the illness that they decided to abandon Brunei to return to Manila on 26 June 1578  after just 72 days  Before doing so  they burned the mosque  a high structure with a five tier roof  28  Pengiran Seri Lela died in August September 1578  probably from the same illness that had afflicted his Spanish allies  although there was suspicion he could have been poisoned by the ruling Sultan  Seri Lela s daughter left with the Spanish and went on to marry a Christian Tagalog  named Agust n de Legazpi de Tondo  29  The local Brunei accounts 15  differ greatly from the generally accepted view of events  The Castilian War entering the national conscience as a heroic episode  with the Spaniards being driven out by Bendahara Sakam  supposedly a brother of the ruling Sultan  and a thousand native warriors  This version  nevertheless  is disputed by most historians and considered a folk hero recollection  probably created decades or centuries after  30  Notwithstanding the retreat  Brunei lost a number of territories to Spain  including the island of Luzon  31  A civil war was fought from 1660 to 1673   edit  British Intervention The decline of the Bruneian Empire culminated in the 19th century  when Brunei lost much of its territory to the White Rajahs of Sarawak  resulting in its current small landmass and separation into two parts  32  The Treaty of Protection which was negotiated by Sir Hugh Low was signed into effect on 17 September 1888  This enables Britain control over Brunei s external affairs  This treaty was signed after Sultan Hashim  the Sultan at that time  appealed to the British to stop partitioning and annexing Brunei  as what James Brooke was doing since 1846  33  One of the terms in the agreement included that the Sultan  could not cede or lease any territory to foreign powers without British consent   When James Brooke later annexed the Pandaruan district  however the British did not take any action against him as they regarded James Brooke as not being a foreigner  The British also attacked Brunei on July 1846 due to disagreement of on who was the rightful Sultan  34  Brunei was a British protectorate from 1888 to 1984  4 British Residents were introduced in Brunei under the Supplementary Protectorate Agreement in 1906  35  The Residents were to advise the Sultan on all matters of administration  However  the Resident assumed more executive control than the Sultan  The Residential system ended in 1959  36   edit  Discovery of Oil Oil was discovered in 1929 after several fruitless attempts  37  Two men  F F  Marriot and T G  Cochrane smelled oil near the Seria river in late 1926  38  They informed a geophysicist which then conducted a survey there  In 1927  gas seepages were reported in the area  Seria Well Number One  S 1  was drilled on 12 July 1928  Oil was struck at 297 meters on 5 April 1929  Seria Well Number 2 was drilled on 19 August 1929 and is still producing oil to this date  39  Oil production increased considerably in the 1930s  In 1940  oil production was at more than six million barrels  39  The British Malayan Petroleum Company  now Brunei Shell Petroleum Company  was formed on 22 July 1922  40  The first offshore well was drilled in 1957  41   edit  Japanese Occupation Brunei was occupied by Japan from 1941 to 1945 during World War II  The Japanese landed 10 000 men at Kuala Belait on 16 December 1941  The British in Brunei were easily defeated due to their unpreparedness and the fact that they were outnumbered  After capturing Kuala Belait  the Japanese army moved on to Brunei Town  now Bandar Seri Begawan  and captured it on 22 December 1941  capturing the police headquarters there  Brunei was liberated on 10 June 1945 under Operation Oboe Six  42  43   edit  Post World War II After World War II  a new government was formed in Brunei under the British Military Administration  BMA   It consisted mainly of Australian officers and servicemen  44  The administration of Brunei was handed over to the Civil Administration on 6 July 1945  The Brunei State Council was also revived that year  42  The BMA was also tasked to revive the Bruneian economy  which was extensively damaged by the Japanese during their occupation  They were also tasked with putting out the fires started on the wells of Seria  which was started by the Japanese prior to their defeat  42  Before 1941  the Governor of the Straits Settlements based in Singapore was responsible for the duties of British High Commissioner for Brunei  Sarawak  and North Borneo  now Sabah   45  The first British High Commissioner for Brunei was the Governor of Sarawak  Sir Charles Ardon Clarke  The Barisan Pemuda   Youth Movement    abbreviated as BARIP  was the first political party to be formed in Brunei  It was formed on 12 April 1946  The aims of the party were to  preserve the sovereignty of the Sultan and the country  and to defend the rights of the Malays   46  BARIP also contributed to the formation of the country s National Anthem  The party was dissolved in 1948 due to inactivity  In 1959  a new constitution was written declaring Brunei a self governing state  while its foreign affairs  security  and defense remained the responsibility of the United Kingdom  9  There was a small rebellion against the monarchy in 1962  which was suppressed with help from the United Kingdom  This event became known as the Brunei Revolt and was partly responsible for the failure to create the North Borneo Federation  The rebellion partially affected Brunei s decision to opt out of the Malaysian Federation  9  Brunei gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984  9  The official National Day  which celebrates the country s independence  however  is held on 23 February due to tradition   edit  Writing of the Constitution In July 1953  Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III formed a seven member committee named Tujuh Serangkai to find out the citizens  views regarding a written constitution for Brunei  In May 1954  a meeting attended by the Sultan  the Resident and the High Commissioner was held to discuss the findings of the committee  In March 1959 Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III led a delegation to London to discuss the proposed Constitution  47  The British delegation was led by Sir Alan Lennox Boyd who was the Secretary of State for the Colonies  The British Government later accepted the draft constitution  On 29 September 1959  the Constitution Agreement was signed in Bandar Seri Begawan  The agreement was signed by Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III and Sir Robert Scott  the Commissioner General for Southeast Asia  Some of the points of the constitution were  35  The Sultan was made the Supreme Head of State  Brunei was responsible for its internal administration  The British Government was now responsible for foreign and defence affairs only  The post of Resident was abolished and replaced by a British High Commissioner  Five councils were also set up  48  The Executive Council The Legislative Council of Brunei The Privy Council The Council Of Succession The State Religious Council  edit  The National Development Plans A series of National Development Plans were initiated by the 28th Sultan of Brunei  Omar Ali Saifuddien III   edit  The First National Development Plan The First National Development plan was introduced in 1953  49  A total sum of B 100 million was approved by the Brunei State Council for the plan  E R  Bevington from the Colonial Office in Fiji  50  A  14 million Gas Plant was built under the plan  In 1954  survey and exploration work were undertaken by the Brunei Shell Petroluem on both offshore and onshore fields  By 1956  production reached 114 700 bpd  Developments on education were also made  In 1952  a written policy on education was made  50  By 1958  expenditure on education totaled at  4 million  50  Communications were also improved with new roads built and and reconstruction works at Berakas Airport being completed at 1954  51   edit  The Second National Development Plan The second National Development Plan was launched in 1962  51  A major oil and gas field was discovered in 1963  with this discovery  Liquefied Natural Gas became important  Developments in the oil and gas sector has continued actively and oil production has steadily increased since then  52  The plan also saw an increase of production of meat and eggs  The fishing industry increased its output by 25  throughout the course of the plan  The Muara Deepwater Port was also constructed under the plan  Power requirements were met and studies were made to provide electricity to rural areas  52  Efforts were made to eradicate malaria  with the help of the World Health Organisation  under the plan  Efforts were successful  bringing the down the cases of malaria from 300 cases in 1953 to only 66 cases in 1959  53  The death rate was also brought down from 20 per thousand in 1947 to 11 3 per thousand in 1953  53  This has been attributed to public sanitation and improvement of drainage and the provision of piped pure water to the population  53   edit  Politics and government Main article  Politics of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah  Sultan of Brunei  Brunei has a constitutional sultanate  It has a legal system based on English common law  although Islamic shariah law supersedes this in some cases  4  The political system in the country is governed by the constitution and the tradition of the Malay Islamic Monarchy  the concept of

article  Culture of Brunei The culture of Brunei is predominantly Malay  reflecting its ethnicity   with heavy influences from Islam  but is seen as more conservative than Malaysia  88  Brunei s culture is mainly derived from the Old Malay World  which encompassed the Malay Archipelago and from this stemmed what is known as the Malay Civilisation  Based on historical facts  various cultural elements and foreign civilisations had a hand in influencing the culture of this country  Thus  the influence of culture can be traced to four dominating periods of animism  Hinduism  Islam and the West  However  it was Islam that managed to wind its roots deeply into the culture of Brunei hence it became a way of life and adopted as the state s ideology and philosophy  89  As a Sharia country  the sale and public consumption of alcohol is banned  90  Non Muslims are allowed to bring in a limited amount of alcohol from their point of embarkation overseas for their own private consumption  54
