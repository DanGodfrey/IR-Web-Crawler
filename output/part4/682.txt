residents of Tokelau who were absent on census night  Tokelau     to k la    is a territory of New Zealand in the South Pacific Ocean that consists of three tropical coral atolls with a combined land area of 10 km2 and a population of approximately 1 400  The atolls lie north of the Samoan Islands  east of Tuvalu  south of the Phoenix Islands  southwest of the more distant Line Islands  both island groups belonging to Kiribati  and northwest of the Cook Islands  The United Nations General Assembly designated Tokelau a Non Self Governing Territory  2  Until 1976 the official name was Tokelau Islands  Tokelau is sometimes referred to by the older  colonial name of The Union Islands  Contents 1 Etymology and consequences of name usage 2 Geography 3 Environment 4 History 4 1 Western

North Wind   The islands were named the Union Islands and Union Group by European explorers at an unknown time  Tokelau Islands was adopted as the name in 1946  and was contracted to Tokelau on 9 December 1976  The change from Tokelau Islands to Tokelau marked a slight shift in emphasis  with consequences in regional diplomacy  in that the term Tokelau Islands clearly and substantially referred to a geographical expression  that is  a range of islands  whatever else it may connote  It is not necessarily controversial to refer by name to a range of islands  even though they may come under two or more political jurisdictions  Tokelau  on the other hand  can be taken to refer more immediately to some concept of nationhood  arguably infusing increased meaning to the draft 2006 independence constitution of Tokelau  which somewhat controversially claims Tokelauan inhabited Olohega  or Swains Island   currently part of American Samoa  as part of its national territory   citation needed   edit  Geography Map of all Tokelau Islands  Swains Island is shown to the south  Tokelau includes three atolls in the South Pacific Ocean between longitudes 171  and 173  W and between latitudes 8  and 10  S  about midway between Hawaii and New Zealand  They lie about 500 km  311 mi  north of Samoa  The atolls are Atafu  Nukunonu  both in a group of islands once called the Duke of Clarence Group  and Fakaofo  once Bowditch Island  Their combined land area is 10 8 km   There are no ports or harbours  Tokelau lies in the Pacific typhoon belt  A fourth island that is culturally  historically  and geographically  but not politically  part of the Tokelau chain is Swains Island  Olohega   under United States control since about 1900 and administered as part of American Samoa since 1925  Swains Island was claimed by the United States pursuant to the Guano Islands Act  as were the other three islands of Tokelau  which claims were ceded to Tokelau by treaty in 1979  In the draft constitution of Tokelau subject to the Tokelauan self determination referendum in 2006  Olohega is claimed as part of Tokelau  a claim surrendered in the same 1979 treaty which established a boundary between American Samoa and Tokelau  Tokelau s claim to Swains is generally comparable to the Marshall Islands  claim to US administered Wake Island  but the re emergence of this somewhat dormant issue has been an unintended result of the United Nations  recent efforts to promote decolonization in Tokelau  Tokelauans have proved somewhat reluctant to push their national identity in the political realm  recent decolonization moves have mainly been driven from outside for ideological reasons  But at the same time  Tokelauans are reluctant to disown their common cultural identity with Swains Islanders who speak their language  Geographic locations of Tokelau s atolls Atoll Coordinates Atafu 8 33 6 S 172 30 3 W     8 55167 S 172 50083 W     8 55167   172 50083

Environment See also  List of birds of Tokelau and List of mammals of Tokelau Tokelau is located in the Western Polynesian tropical moist forests ecoregion  Most of the original vegetation has been replaced by coconut plantations some of which have been abandoned and became scrubby forests  The atolls of Tokelau provide habitat for 38 indigenous plant species  over 150 insect species and 10 land crab species  One of the greatest threats to biodiversity is posed by introduced mammalian predators such as the Polynesian Rat  3  In 2011 Tokelau declared its entire exclusive economic zone of 319 031 km  a shark sanctuary  4   edit  History Archaeological evidence indicates that the atolls of Tokelau   Atafu  Nukunonu  and Fakaofo   were settled about 1 000 years ago and may have been a  nexus  into Eastern Polynesia  5  Inhabitants followed Polynesian mythology with the local god Tui Tokelau  and developed forms of music  see Music of Tokelau  and art  The three atolls functioned largely independently while maintaining social and linguistic cohesion  Tokelauan society was governed by chiefly clans  and there were occasional inter atoll skirmishes and wars as well as inter marriage  Fakaofo  the  chiefly island   6  held some dominance over Atafu and Nukunonu after the dispersal of Atafu  Life on the atolls was subsistence based  with reliance on fish and coconut  7   edit  Western discovery and contact Commodore John Byron discovered Atafu on 24 June 1765 and named it  Duke of York s Island   Parties onshore reported that there were no signs of current or previous inhabitants  8  9 Captain Edward Edwards  in knowledge of Byron s discovery  visited Atafu on 6 June 1791 citation needed  in search of the Bounty mutineers  There were no permanent inhabitants  but houses contained canoes and fishing gear  suggesting the island was used as a temporary residence by fishing parties  9  On 12 June 1791  Edwards sailed southward and discovered Nukunonu  naming it  Duke of Clarence s Island   10  A landing party could not make contact with the people but saw  morais   burying places  and canoes with  stages in their middle  sailing across the lagoons  9  On 29 October 1825 August R  Strong of the U S N Dolphin wrote of his crew s arrival at the atoll Nukunonu   Upon examination  we found they had removed all the women and children from the settlement  which was quite small  and put them in canoes lying off a rock in the lagoon  They would frequently come near the shore  but when we approached they would pull off with great noise and precipitation    The Journal of the South Pacific  110  3   pp  296   Fakaofo islanders  drawn in 1841 by the United States Exploring Expedition  On 14 February 1835 Captain Smith of the United States whaler General Jackson records discovering Fakaofo  calling it  D Wolf s Island   11  12  On 25 January 1841  the United States Exploring Expedition visited Atafu and discovered a small population living on the island  The residents appeared to be temporary  evidenced by the lack of a chief and the possession of double canoes  used for inter island travel   They desired to barter  and possessed blue beads and a plane iron  indicating previous interaction with foreigners  The expedition reached Nukunonu on 28 January 1841 but did not record any information about inhabitants  On 29 January 1841  the expedition discovered Fakaofo and named it  Bowditch   13  The islanders were found to be similar in appearance and nature to those in Atafu  14  Missionaries preached Christianity in Tokelau from 1845 to the 1860s  French Catholic missionaries on Wallis Island  also known as  Uvea  and missionaries of the Protestant London Missionary Society in Samoa used native teachers to convert the Tokelauans  Atafu was converted to Protestantism by the London Missionary Society  Nukunonu was converted to Catholicism and Fakaofo was converted to both denominations  15  Peruvian slave traders arrived in 1863 and took nearly all  253  of the able bodied men to work as labourers  The men died of dysentery and smallpox  and very few returned to Tokelau  With this loss  the system of governance became based on the  Taupulega   or  Councils of Elders   where individual families on each atoll were represented  7  12  During this time  Polynesian immigrants and American  Scottish  French  Portuguese and German beachcombers settled  marrying local women and repopulating the atolls  12   edit  21st Century Until December 2011  Tokelau was almost a day behind New Zealand  being 10 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time  UTC    16  17  At midnight 29 December 2011 Tokelau shifted to UTC 14 00 in response to Samoa s decision to do the same  This brought Tokelau closer to New Zealand time  and in the process omitted 30 December   18   edit  Government In 1877 the islands were included under the protection of the United Kingdom by an Order in Council which claimed jurisdiction over all unclaimed Pacific Islands  Commander C  F  Oldham on HMS Egeria landed at each of the three atolls in June 1889 19  and officially raised the Union Flag  declaring the group a British protectorate  In 1920  Tokelauans became recognised as British subjects  20  The British government annexed Tokelau to the colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands and transferred Tokelau to New Zealand administration in 1926  abolishing the islands  chiefdoms  By the Tokelau Act of 1948  sovereignty over Tokelau was transferred to New Zealand  Defence is also the responsibility of New Zealand  When the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act 1948 came into effect on 1 January 1949  Tokelauans who were British subjects gained New Zealand citizenship   a status which they still hold today  20  At the moment  Tokelauans are drafting a constitution and developing institutions and patterns of self government as Tokelau moves towards free association with New Zealand  similar to Niue and the Cook Islands  citation needed  Villages are entitled to enact their own laws regulating their daily lives and New Zealand law only applies where it has been extended by specific enactment  Serious crime is rare and there are no prisons   offenders are publicly rebuked  fined or made to work  21   edit  Politics Main article  Politics of Tokelau The head of state is Elizabeth II  the Queen in right of New Zealand  who also reigns over the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms  The Queen is represented in the territory by acting Administrator Jonathan Kings  The current head of government is Foua Toloa  who presides over the Council for the Ongoing Governance of Tokelau  which functions as a cabinet  The Council consists of the Faipule  leader  and Pulenuku  village mayor  of each of the three atolls  22  The monarch is hereditary  the administrator appointed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade in New Zealand  and the office of head of government rotates between the three Faipule for a one year term  22  The Tokelau Amendment Act of 1996 confers legislative power on the General Fono  a unicameral body  The number of seats each atoll receives in the Fono is determined by population   at present  Fakaofo and Atafu each have seven and Nukunonu has six  22 Faipule and Pukenuku  atoll leaders and village mayors  also sit in the Fono  22  On 11 November 2004  Tokelau and New Zealand took steps to formulate a treaty that would turn Tokelau from a non self governing territory to a self governing state in free association with New Zealand  Besides the treaty  a UN sponsored referendum on self determination took place  with the three islands voting on successive days starting 13 February 2006   Tokelauans based in Apia  Samoa  voted on 11 February   23  Out of 581 votes cast  349 were for Free Association  being short of the two thirds majority required for the measure to pass  24  The referendum was profiled  somewhat light heartedly  in the 1 May 2006 issue of The New Yorker magazine  25  A repeat referendum took place on 20 24 October 2007  again narrowly failing to approve self government  This time the vote was short by just 16 votes or 3   26  In May 2008  the United Nations  Secretary General Ban Ki moon urged colonial powers  to complete the decolonization process in every one of the remaining 16 Non Self Governing Territories   including Tokelau  27  This led the New Zealand Herald to comment that the United Nations was  apparently frustrated by two failed attempts to get Tokelau to vote for independence   28  In April 2008  speaking as leader of the National Party  future New Zealand Prime Minister John Key stated that New Zealand had  imposed two referenda on the people of the Tokelau Islands   and questioned  the accepted wisdom that small states should undergo a de colonisation process   29   edit  Economy Nukunonu Lagoon in Tokelau  According to the US Central Intelligence Agency s list of countries by GDP  PPP  Tokelau has the smallest economy of any country in the world  Tokelau has an annual purchasing power of about US 1 000   674  per capita  The government is almost entirely dependent on subsidies from New Zealand  It has annual revenues of less than US 500 000   336 995  against expenditures of some US 2 8 million   1 9 million   The deficit is made up by aid from New Zealand  Tokelau annually exports around US 100 000   67 000  of stamps  copra and woven and carved handicrafts and imports over US 300 000   202 000  of foodstuffs  building materials  and fuel to  and from  New Zealand  New Zealand also pays directly for the cost of medical and education services  Local industries include small scale enterprises for copra production  wood work  plaited craft goods  stamps  coins  and fishing  Agriculture and livestock produces coconuts  copra  breadfruit  papayas  bananas  figs  pigs  poultry and few goats  Many Tokelauans live in New Zealand and support their families in Tokelau through remittances  Tokelau has plans to only use renewable energy  If this is achieved it will be the only nation to have achieved this goal  30  It is expected that by mid 2012 Tokelau s electricity supply will be 93  generated by photovoltaics  with the remainder generated from coconut oil  31   edit  Internet domain names Main article   tk Tokelau

Tokelau gives most domain names under its authority away to anyone for free to gain publicity for the territory  This has allowed the nation to gain enhanced telecommunications technologies  such as more computers and Internet access for Tokelauan residents  citation needed   edit  Demographics The atoll of Fakaofo  southernmost of the Tokelau Islands  According to the 2011 Tokelau Census  Tokelau has a de jure usually resident population of 1 411 people  The census shows a 3 8  decrease in the de jure usually resident population between 2006 and 2011  33  The nationals of Tokelau are called Tokelauans  and the major ethnic group is Polynesian  The country has no minorities  The major religion is the Congregational Christian Church and the main language is Tokelauan  but English is also spoken  Tokelau has fewer than 1 500 Polynesian inhabitants in three villages who speak Tokelauan and English  Their isolation and lack of resources greatly limits economic development and confines agriculture to the subsistence level  The very limited natural resources and overcrowding are contributing to emigration to New Zealand and Samoa  resulting in a population decline of about 0 9  per year  citation needed  Depletion of tuna has made fishing for food more difficult  On the island of Atafu almost all inhabitants are members of the Congregational Christian Church of Samoa  On Nukunonu almost all are Roman Catholic  On Fakaofo both denominations are present with the Congregational Christian Church predominant  The total proportions are  Congregational Christian Church 62   Roman Catholic 34   other 5   34  While slightly more females than males live on Atafu and Fakaofo  males make up 57  of Nukunonu residents  35  Only 9  of Tokelauans aged 40 or more have never been married  36  One quarter of the population were born overseas  almost all the rest live on the same atoll they were born on  37  Most households own 5 or more pigs  38  Despite its low income  Tokelau has a life expectancy of 69 years  comparable with parts of Europe  39   edit  Sport See also  Rugby union in Tokelau and Rugby league in Tokelau Due to its small size  Tokelau is unaffiliated to most international sports organisations  and rarely takes part in international events  The only significant international competition the country takes part in is the Pacific Games  Tokelau won its first ever gold medals at the 2007 Pacific Games in Apia  winning a total of five medals  three gold  a silver and a bronze   all in lawn bowls  and finishing twelfth  out of twenty two  on the overall medal table  This included two gold medals for Violina Linda Pedro  in the women s pairs and the women s singles   making her Tokelau s most successful individual athlete to date  40  In October 2010  table tennis became  the first sport in Tokelau to be granted membership at a Continental or World level   when the Tokelau Table Tennis Association was formally established and became the 23rd member of the Oceania Table Tennis Federation  41  Tokelau was due to take part  for the first time  in the 2010 Commonwealth Games  in Delhi  42  but  for unknown reasons  ultimately did not do so  43  Tokelau does have a National Sports Federation  and the most important sports event within the country is arguably the Tokelau Games  which are held yearly  When they are held   all of Tokelau virtually stands still   as   i n excess of 50  of the population take part and all work and school stops at the time   The 2010 Games included competitions in rugby sevens  netball and kilikiti  alongside  a cultural evening       where each atoll showcases their traditional songs and dances   41  Netball is thought to have been introduced to Tokelau by the British  but became more popular when New Zealand s government took over the territory  The sport is often played during inter island sport competitions  alongside other sports like rugby league and volleyball  44   edit  Healthcare and education Main article  Healthcare in Tokelau Each atoll has a school and hospital  The health services have a Director of Health based in Apia and a Chief Clinical Advisor who moves from atoll to atoll as required to assist the doctors attached to each hospital  In 2007 there was not always a doctor on each island and locums were appointed to fill the gaps  Upcoming Tokelaun medical graduates should alleviate this shortage in the coming years  Many Tokelauan youth travel to New Zealand to further their education and the ship is full around Christmas time with students returning home and then heading off for another year of study   edit  Communications and transportation A barge leaves the landing ramp in Nukunono to collect cargo and passengers from the MV Tokelau Tokelau has a radio telephone service between the islands and to Samoa  In 1997  a government regulated telephone service  TeleTok  with three satellite earth stations was established  Each atoll has a radio broadcast station that broadcasts shipping and weather reports and every household has a radio or access to one  Tokelau is served by the MV Tokelau  owned by the country  with the trip from Apia in Samoa taking a little over a day  Ships load and unload cargo by motoring up to the down wind  leeward  side of the islet where the people live and maintaining station  by intermittent use of engines  close to the reef edge so that a landing barge can be motored out to transfer cargo to or from the shore  On returning to shore  the barge negotiates a narrow channel through the reef to the beach  Usually this landing is subject to ocean swell and beaching requires considerable skill and  often  coral abrasions to bodies  When bad weather prevents the barge making the trip  the ship stands off to wait suitable weather or goes off to one of the other atolls to attempt to load or unload its passengers or cargo  or both  There is no airport in Tokelau  so boats are the only means of travel and transport   edit  Cyclone Percy Cyclone Percy struck and severely damaged Tokelau in late February and early March 2005  Forecasters underestimated the cyclone s strength and the length of time it would be in vicinity to Tokelau  It coincided with a spring tide which put most of the area of the two villages on Fakaofo and Nukunonu under a metre of seawater  The cyclone also caused major erosion on several islets of all three atolls  damaging roads and bridges and disrupting electric power and telecommunications systems  The cyclone did significant and widespread damage to food crops including bananas  coconuts and pandanus  It did not seriously injure anyone but villagers lost significant amounts of property  The geographic future of Tokelau depends on the height of the ocean  No significant land is more than two metres above high water of ordinary tides  This means Tokelau is particularly vulnerable to any possible sea level rises   edit  Books and publications Tokelau  a
