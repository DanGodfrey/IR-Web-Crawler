official name of the state is the  Commonwealth of Massachusetts   15  Colloquially  it is often referred to simply as  the Commonwealth   While this designation is part of the state s official name  it has no practical implications  Massachusetts has the same position and powers within the United States as other states  16   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of Massachusetts Massachusetts is the 7th smallest state in the United States  It is located in the New England region of the northeastern United States  and has an area of 10 555 square miles  27 340 km2   4  Several large bays distinctly shape its coast  Boston is the largest city  at the inmost point of Massachusetts Bay  the mouth of the Charles River  which is the longest river entirely within Massachusetts  The state extends from the mountains of the Appalachian system in the west to the sandy beaches and rocky shorelines of the Atlantic coast  The National Park Service administers a number of natural and historical sites in Massachusetts  17  Along with twelve national historic sites  areas  and corridors  the National Park Service also manages the Cape Cod National Seashore and the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area  17  In addition  the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation maintains a number of parks  trails  and beaches throughout the commonwealth  18  19  20   edit  Ecology The primary biome of inland Massachusetts is temperate deciduous forest  21  Although much of the state had been cleared for agriculture  leaving only traces of old growth forest in isolated pockets  secondary growth has regenerated in many rural areas as farms have been abandoned  22  Currently  forests cover around 62  of Massachusetts  23  24  The areas most affected by human development include the Greater Boston area in the east  the smaller Springfield metropolitan area in the west  and the largely agricultural Pioneer Valley  25  Animals that have become locally extinct over the past few centuries include gray wolves  elk  wolverines  and mountain lions  26  Many coastal areas in Massachusetts provide breeding areas for species such as the Piping Plover  A number of species are doing well despite  and in some cases because of  the increased urbanization of the commonwealth  Peregrine falcons utilize office towers in larger cities as nesting areas  27  and the population of coyotes  whose diet may include garbage and roadkill  has been increasing in recent decades  28 White tailed deer  raccoons  wild turkeys and eastern gray squirrels are also found throughout Massachusetts  26  29  In more rural areas in the western part of the state  larger mammals such as moose and black bears have returned  largely due to reforestation following the regional decline in agriculture  30  31  Massachusetts is located along the Atlantic Flyway  a major route for migratory waterfowl along the Atlantic coast  32  Lakes in central Massachusetts provide habitat for the common loon  33  while a significant population of long tailed ducks winter off Nantucket  34  Small offshore islands and beaches are home to roseate terns and are important breeding areas for the locally threatened piping plover  35  36  Protected areas such as the Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge provide critical breeding habitat for shorebirds and a variety of marine wildlife including a large population of gray seals  37  Freshwater fish species in the commonwealth include bass  carp  catfish  and trout  38  while saltwater species such as Atlantic cod  haddock and American lobster populate offshore waters  39  Other marine species include Harbor seals  the endangered North Atlantic right whales  as well as humpback whales  fin whales  minke whales and Atlantic white sided dolphins  26   edit  History Main article  History of Massachusetts Mayflower in Plymouth Harbor by William Halsall  1882  The Pilgrims were a group of Puritans who founded Plymouth in 1620   edit  Early Massachusetts was originally inhabited by tribes of the Algonquian language family such as the Wampanoag  Narragansett  Nipmuc  Pocomtuc  Mahican  and Massachusett  40  41  While cultivation of crops like squash and corn supplemented their diets  these tribes were generally dependent on hunting  gathering and fishing for most of their food supply  40  Villages consisted of lodges called wigwams as well as long houses  41  and tribes were led by male or female elders known as sachems  42   edit  Colonial period In the early 1600s  after contact had been made with Europeans  but before permanent settlements were established   large numbers of the indigenous people in the northeast of what is now the United States were killed by virgin soil epidemics such as smallpox  measles  influenza  and perhaps leptospirosis  43  In 1617 1619  smallpox reportedly killed 90  of the Massachusetts Bay Native Americans  44  The first English settlers in Massachusetts  the Pilgrims  established their settlement at Plymouth in 1620  and developed friendly relations with the native Wampanoag  45  This was the second successful permanent English colony in North America  after the Jamestown Colony  The Pilgrims were soon followed by Puritans who established the Massachusetts Bay Colony at present day Boston in 1630  46  The Puritans  who believed the Church of England was too hierarchical  among other disagreements  came to Massachusetts for religious freedom  47  although  unlike the Plymouth colony  the bay colony was founded under a royal charter  Both religious dissent and expansionism resulted in several new colonies being founded shortly after Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay elsewhere in New England  Dissenters such as Anne Hutchinson and Roger Williams were banished due to religious disagreements   Hutchinson held meetings in her home discussing flaws in the Puritan beliefs  while Williams believed that the Puritan beliefs were wrong  and the Indians must be respected   In 1636  Williams founded the colony of Rhode Island and Hutchinson joined him there several years later  48  In 1691  the colonies of Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth were united  along with present day Maine  which had previously been divided between Massachusetts and New York  into the Province of Massachusetts Bay  49  Shortly after the arrival of the new province s first governor  Sir William Phips  the Salem witch trials took place  in which a number of men and women were hanged  50  The most destructive earthquake yet known in New England occurred in 1755  causing considerable damage across the commonwealth  51  Percy s Rescue at Lexington by Ralph Earl and Amos Doolittle from 1775  an illustration of the Battles of Lexington and Concord  Massachusetts was a center of the movement for independence from Great Britain  colonists here had long had uneasy relations with the British monarchy  including open rebellion under the Dominion of New England in the 1680s  49  Protests against British attempts to tax the colonies after the French and Indian War ended in 1763 led to the Boston Massacre in 1770  and the 1773 Boston Tea Party escalated tensions to the breaking point  52  Anti Parliamentary activity by men such as Samuel Adams and John Hancock  followed by reprisals by the British government  were a primary reason for the unity of the Thirteen Colonies and the outbreak of the American Revolution  53  The Battles of Lexington and Concord initiated the American Revolutionary War and were fought in the Massachusetts towns of Concord and Lexington  54  Future President George Washington took over what would become the Continental Army after the battle  His first victory was the Siege of Boston in the winter of 1775 6  after which the British were forced to evacuate the city  55  The event is still celebrated in Suffolk County as Evacuation Day  56   edit  Federal period Bostonian John Adams  known as the  Atlas of Independence   was an important figure in both the struggle for independence as well as the formation of the new United States  57  Adams was highly involved in the push for separation from Britain and the writing of the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780  which  in the Elizabeth Freeman and Quock Walker cases  effectively made Massachusetts the first state to have a constitution that declared universal rights and  as interpreted by Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice William Cushing  abolished slavery   57  58  Later  Adams was active in early American foreign affairs and succeeded Washington as US President  57  His son  John Quincy Adams  would go on to become the sixth US President  57  After independence and during the formative years of independent American government  Shays  Rebellion was an armed uprising in the western half of the state from 1786 to 1787  The rebels were mostly small farmers angered by crushing war debt and taxes  The rebellion was one of the major factors in the decision to draft a stronger national constitution to replace the Articles of Confederation  59  On February 6  1788  Massachusetts became the sixth state to ratify the U S  Constitution  60   edit  19th century In 1820  Maine separated from Massachusetts  of which it had been first a contiguous and then a non contiguous part  and entered the Union as the 23rd state as a result of the ratification of the Missouri Compromise  61  Textile mills such as the Boott Mills in Lowell made Massachusetts a leader in the US industrial revolution  During the 19th century  Massachusetts became a national leader in the American Industrial Revolution  with factories around Boston producing textiles and shoes  and factories around Springfield producing precision manufacturing tools and paper  62  63  The economy transformed from one based primarily on agriculture to an industrial one  initially making use of waterpower and later the steam engine to power factories  and canals and later railroads for transporting goods and materials  64  At first  the new industries drew labor from Yankees on nearby subsistence farms  and later relied upon immigrant labor from Europe and Canada  65  66  In the years leading up to the Civil War  Massachusetts was a center of social progressivism  Transcendentalism  and abolitionist activity  Horace Mann made the state system of schools the national model  67 Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson made major contributions to American thought  68  Members of the Transcendentalism movement  they emphasized the importance of the natural world and emotion to humanity  68  Although significant opposition to abolitionism existed early on in Massachusetts  resulting in anti abolitionist riots between 1835 and 1837  69  opposition to slavery gradually increased in the next few decades  70  71  The works of abolitionists contributed to subsequent actions of the state during the Civil War  Massachusetts was the first state to recruit  train  and arm a Black regiment with White officers  the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry  72  The Robert Gould Shaw Memorial in Boston Common contains a relief depicting the 54th regiment  73   edit  20th century Part of the  Big Dig  construction project  this portion is over the Charles River  The industrial economy began a decline in the early 20th century with the exodus of many manufacturing companies  By the 1920s competition from the South and Midwest  followed by the Great Depression  led to the collapse of the three main industries in Massachusetts  textiles  shoemaking  and mechanized transportation  74  This decline would continue into the latter half of the century  between 1950 and 1979  the number of Bay Staters involved in textile manufacturing declined from 264 000 to 63 000  75  This spurred an exodus of high paying jobs from Western Massachusetts  which suffered greatly as it de industrialized during the last 40 years of the 20th century  76  In Eastern Massachusetts  following World War II  the economy was transformed from one based on heavy industry into a service and high tech based economy  77  Government contracts  private investment  and research facilities led to a new and improved industrial climate  with reduced unemployment and increased per capita income  Suburbanization flourished  and by the 1970s  the Route 128 corridor was dotted with high technology companies who recruited graduates of the area s many elite institutions of higher education  78  The Kennedy family was prominent in Massachusetts politics in the 20th century  Children of businessman and ambassador Joseph P  Kennedy Sr  included John F  Kennedy  who was a senator and US president before his assassination in 1963  Robert F  Kennedy  who was a senator  US attorney general and presidential candidate before his assassination in 1968  Ted Kennedy  a senator from 1962 until his death in 2009  79  and Eunice Kennedy Shriver  a co founder of the Special Olympics  80  The famous Kennedy Compound is located at Hyannisport on Cape Cod  81   edit  Recent history In 1987  the state received federal funding for the Central Artery Tunnel Project  Known as  the Big Dig   it was at the time the biggest federal highway project ever approved  82  The project included making the Central Artery a tunnel under downtown Boston  in addition to the re routing of several other major highways  83  Often controversial  with numerous claims of graft and mismanagement  and with its initial price tag of  2 5 billion increasing to a final tally of over  15 billion  the Big Dig has nonetheless changed the face of Downtown Boston  82  It has connected areas that were once divided by elevated highway   much of the raised old Central Artery was replaced with the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway  and improved traffic conditions along a number of routes  82  83   edit  Demographics Main article  Demographics of

919 771 foreign born residents  88  Most Bay Staters live within the Boston Metropolitan Area  also known as Greater Boston  which in its most expansive sense includes New England s two largest cities  Boston and Worcester  The state s only other metropolitan area is the Springfield Metropolitan Area  also known as Greater Springfield  Centered in the Connecticut River Valley  Greater Springfield includes the revitalizing city of Springfield  and an eclectic array of college towns   e g  Amherst and Northampton  and rural areas to the north and west  Geographically  the center of population of Massachusetts is located in Middlesex County  in the town of Natick  89  Like the rest of the northeastern United States  the population of Massachusetts has continued to grow in the past few decades  although at a slower pace than states in the South or West  90  The latest census estimates show that the commonwealth s population grew by 3 9  since 2000  compared with nearly 10  nationwide  In their decisions to leave Massachusetts  most former residents cited high housing costs and a high cost of living  91  Another factor has been the transformation from a manufacturing economy into one based on high technology  leaving limited employment options for lower skilled workers  particularly males  92  Foreign immigration is more than making up for these losses  causing the state s population to continue to grow as of the 2010 Census  particularly in Massachusetts gateway cities where costs of living are lower   90  93  40  of foreign immigrants were from Central or South America  according to a 2005 Census Bureau study  Many residents who have settled in Greater Springfield claim Puerto Rican descent  90  Many areas of the commonwealth showed relatively stable population trends between 2000 and 2010  93 Exurban Boston and coastal areas grew the most rapidly  while Berkshire County in far Western Massachusetts and Barnstable County on Cape Cod were the only counties to lose population as of the 2010 Census  93  Both of these counties feature many  second homes   and constitute major centers of Massachusetts tourism  In 2005  79  of the state population

century  immigrant groups began arriving to the commonwealth in large numbers  first from Ireland in the 1840s  97  and later from Quebec as well as places in Europe such as Italy and Poland  98  In the early 20th century  a number of African Americans immigrated to Massachusetts  although in somewhat fewer numbers than many other Northern states  99  Later in the 20th century  immigration from Latin America  Africa  and East Asia increased considerably  Massachusetts has the third largest population of Haitians in the United States  100  Massachusetts also has a relatively large population of Portuguese descent  Many of the earliest Portuguese speaking immigrants came from the Azores in the 19th century to work in the whaling industry in cities like New Bedford  101  102  Later  further waves of Portuguese arrived  this time often finding work in the textile mills  102 Lowell is home to the second largest Cambodian  Khmer  community in the nation  103  The Wampanoag tribe maintains reservations at Aquinnah  at Grafton  on Martha s Vineyard  and at Mashpee on Cape Cod  104  105  while the Nipmuck maintain two state recognized reservations in the central part of the state  While Massachusetts had avoided many of the more violent forms of racial strife seen elsewhere in the US  examples such as the successful electoral showings of the nativist  mainly anti Catholic  Know Nothings in the 1850s  106  the controversial Sacco and Vanzetti executions in the 1920s  107  and Boston s opposition to desegregation busing in the 1970s 108  show that the ethnic history of the commonwealth was not completely harmonious   edit  Religion Massachusetts was founded and settled by the Puritans in 1628  The descendants of the Puritans belong to many different churches  in the direct line of inheritance are the Congregational United Church of Christ  and congregations of Unitarian Universalist Association  Most people in Massachusetts were Christians  Some also believed in
