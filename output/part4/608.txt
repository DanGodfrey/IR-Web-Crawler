expenses  whether through privately purchased insurance  social insurance or a non insurance social welfare program funded by the government  1  Synonyms for this usage include  health coverage    health care coverage  and  health benefits   In a more technical sense  the term is used to describe any form of insurance that provides protection against the costs of medical services  This usage includes private insurance and social insurance programs such as Medicare  but excludes social welfare programs such as Medicaid  In addition to medical expense insurance  it also includes insurance covering disability or long term nursing or custodial care needs  As of 2010 just under 84  of Americans had some form of health insurance  While the pool of people covered by private insurance is shrinking  Americans  particularly those of working age  continue to rely heavily on commercial plans for their health care coverage  According to the United States Census Bureau  roughly 55  obtain insurance through an employer  while about 10  purchase it directly  About 31  of Americans were enrolled in a public health insurance program  14 5   45 million   although that number has since risen to 48 million  had Medicare  15 9   49 million  has Medicaid  and 4 2   13 million  had military health insurance  2  Meanwhile  more than 49 million people  over 16  of the population  went without health insurance for at least part of 2010  The percentage of non elderly workers without insurance has been rising steadily since 2000  largely because of the rising cost of health care for employers  3  The economic downturn since 2008 has swelled the ranks of the uninsured  in large part because workers who lose their jobs also lose employer sponsored insurance  4  Over 1 million workers lost their health care coverage in January  February and March 2009  Approximately  268 400 more workers lost health care coverage in March 2009 than in March 2008  5  Reversing the slide in insurance coverage was one of the principal rationales for the Affordable Care Act  which is projected to decrease the number of uninsured Americans by 30 million by 2016  6  Contents 1 History 2 Public health

External links  edit  History See also  History of insurance Accident insurance was first offered in the United States by the Franklin Health Assurance Company of Massachusetts  This firm  founded in 1850  offered insurance against injuries arising from railroad and steamboat accidents  Sixty organizations were offering accident insurance in the US by 1866  but the industry consolidated rapidly soon thereafter  While there were earlier experiments  the origins of sickness coverage in the US effectively date from 1890  The first employer sponsored group disability policy was issued in 1911  but this plan s primary purpose was replacing wages lost due to an inability to work  not medical expenses  7  Before the development of medical expense insurance  patients were expected to pay all other health care costs out of their own pockets  under what is known as the fee for service business model  During the middle to late 20th century  traditional disability insurance evolved into modern health insurance programs  Today  most comprehensive private health insurance programs cover the cost of routine  preventive  and emergency health care procedures  and also most prescription drugs  but this was not always the case  Hospital and medical expense policies were introduced during the first half of the 20th century  During the 1920s  individual hospitals began offering services to individuals on a pre paid basis  eventually leading to the development of Blue Cross organizations in the 1930s  7  The first employer sponsored hospitalization plan was created by teachers in Dallas  Texas in 1929  8  Because the plan only covered members  expenses at a single hospital  it is also the forerunner of today s health maintenance organizations  HMOs   8  9  10  Employer sponsored health insurance plans dramatically expanded as a result of wage controls during World War II  8  The labor market was tight because of the increased demand for goods and decreased supply of workers during the war  Federally imposed wage and price controls prohibited manufacturers and other employers raising wages high enough to attract sufficient workers  When the War Labor Board declared that fringe benefits  such as sick leave and health insurance  did not count as wages for the purpose of wage controls  employers responded with significantly increased benefits  8  Between 1940 and 1950  the total number of people enrolled in health insurance plans grew from 20 662 000 to 142 334 000  11  and by 1958  75  of Americans had some form of health coverage  12  Employer sponsored health insurance was considered taxable income until 1954  8  In 1965  President Lyndon B  Johnson signed the Medicare and Medicaid legislation into law  Since their inception  the greatest challenge to the programs has been  spiraling healthcare costs  stemming largely from innovations in medical technology and pharmaceuticals    13  Now  as baby boomers advance toward senior citizenry  concerns about the financial sustainability of the programs frame any discussion about Medicare and Medicaid  The debate for a public health care system in the United States has gone on for about 70 years  President Harry S  Truman was the first United States president to propose a system of public health insurance in his November 19  1945 address  This fund would be open to all Americans  but it would remain optional  Participants would pay monthly fees into the plan  which would cover the cost of any and all medical expenses that arose in a time of need  The government would pay for the cost of services rendered by any doctor who chose to join the program  In addition  the insurance plan would give a cash balance to the policy holder to replace wages lost due to illness or injury  This program was denounced as a socialist approach to medicine by the American Medical Association  AMA  and did not pass   edit  Public health care coverage Public programs provide the primary source of coverage for most seniors and for low income children and families who meet certain eligibility requirements  The primary public programs are Medicare  a federal social insurance program for seniors  generally persons aged 65 and over  and certain disabled individuals  Medicaid  funded jointly by the federal government and states but administered at the state level  which covers certain very low income children and their families  and SCHIP  also a federal state partnership that serves certain children and families who do not qualify for Medicaid but who cannot afford private coverage  Other public programs include military health benefits provided through TRICARE and the Veterans Health Administration and benefits provided through the Indian Health Service  Some states have additional programs for low income individuals  14  Health care costs have risen more rapidly than the general economic growth and continue to do so  with the consequence that Medicare and Medicaid constitute an increasing economic burden in federal spending  15   edit  Medicare Main article  Medicare  United States  In the United States  Medicare is a federal social insurance program that provides health insurance to elderly workers and their dependents  individuals who become totally and permanently disabled  and end stage renal disease  ESRD  patients  Some health care economists  Uwe Reinhardt of Princeton and Stuart Butler among others  assert that the third party payment feature of this program has had the unintended consequence of distorting the price of medical procedures  As a result  the Health Care Financing Administration has set up a list of procedures and corresponding prices under the Resource Based Relative Value Scale  Recent research has found that the health trends of previously uninsured adults  especially those with chronic health problems  improves once they enter the Medicare program  16   edit  Medicare Advantage Main article  Medicare Advantage Medicare Advantage plans expand the health care options for Medicare beneficiaries  The option for Medicare Advantage plans is a result of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997  with the intent to better control the rapid growth in Medicare spending  as well as to provide Medicare beneficiaries more choices   edit  Medicare Part D Main article  Medicare Part D Medicare Part D provides a private insurance option to allow Medicare beneficiaries to purchase subsidized coverage for the costs of prescription drugs  It was enacted as part of the Medicare Prescription Drug  Improvement  and Modernization Act of 2003  MMA  and went into effect on January 1  2006  17   edit  Medicaid Main article  Medicaid Medicaid was instituted for the very poor in 1965  Despite its establishment  the percentage of US residents who lack any form of health insurance has increased since 1994  18  It has been reported that the number of physicians accepting Medicaid has decreased in recent years due to lower reimbursement rates  19  Medicaid is a social welfare or social protection program rather than a social insurance program   edit  State Children s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP  Main article  State Children s Health Insurance Program The State Children s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP  is a joint state federal program to provide health insurance to children in families who earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid  yet cannot afford to buy private insurance  The statutory authority for SCHIP is under title XXI of the Social Security Act  SCHIP programs are run by the individual states according to requirements set by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  and may be structured as independent programs separate from Medicaid  separate child health programs   as expansions of their Medicaid programs  SCHIP Medicaid expansion programs   or combine these approaches  SCHIP combination programs   States receive enhanced federal funds for their SCHIP programs at a rate above the regular Medicaid match   edit  Military health benefits Main article  Military Health System Health benefits are provided to active duty service members  retired service members and their dependents by the Department of Defense Military Health System  MHS   The MHS consists of a direct care network of Military Treatment Facilities and a purchased care network known as TRICARE  Additionally  veterans may also be eligible for benefits through the Veterans Health Administration   edit  Indian health service The Indian Health Service  IHS  provides medical assistance to eligible American Indians at IHS facilities  and helps pay the cost of some services provided by non IHS health care providers  14   edit  State risk pools In 1976  some states began providing guaranteed issuance risk pools  which enable individuals who are medically uninsurable through private health insurance to purchase a state sponsored health insurance plan  usually at higher cost  Minnesota was the first to offer such a plan  34 states  Alabama  Alaska  Arkansas  California  Colorado  Connecticut  Florida  Illinois  Indiana  Iowa  Kansas  Kentucky  Louisiana  Maryland  Minnesota  Mississippi  Missouri  Montana  Nebraska  New Hampshire  New Mexico  North Carolina  North Dakota  Oklahoma  Oregon  South Carolina  South Dakota  Tennessee  Texas  Utah  Washington  West Virginia  Wisconsin  Wyoming  now offer them  Plans vary greatly from state to state  both in their costs and benefits to consumers and in their methods of funding and operations  They serve a very small portion of the uninsurable market about 182 000 people in the U S  as of 2004  20  and about 200 000 in 2008  21  These risk pools allow people with pre existing conditions such as cancer  diabetes  heart disease or other chronic illnesses to be able to switch jobs or seek self employment without fear of being without health care benefits  22  However  the plans are expensive  with premiums that can be double the average policy  and the pools currently cover only 1 in 25 of the so called  uninsurable  population  23  Additionally  even plans which are not expensive can leave those enrolled with little real health insurance beyond  catastrophic  insurance  for example  one insurance plan through Minnesota s high risk pool  while costing only  215 per quarter  includes a  10 000 deductible with no preventative or other health care covered unless and until the enrollee has spent  10 000 of their own money during the year on health care  24  Very sick people can accumulate large medical bills during mandatory waiting periods before their medical expenses are covered  and there are often lifetime expenditure caps  maximums   after which the risk pool no longer pays for any medical expenses  25  Efforts to pass a national pool have been unsuccessful  but some federal tax money has been awarded to states to innovate and improve their plans  With the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  effective by 2014  it will be easier for people with pre existing conditions to afford regular insurance  since all insurers will be fully prohibited from discriminating against or charging higher rates for any individuals based on pre existing medical conditions  26  27   edit  Pre existing Condition Insurance Plan Main article  Pre existing Condition Insurance Plan The Pre existing Condition Insurance Plan  or PCIP  is a transitional program created in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  PPACA   Those eligible for PCIP are citizens of the United States or those legally residing in the U S   who have been uninsured for the last 6 months and  have a pre existing condition or have been denied health coverage because of their health condition   However  if one has health insurance or is enrolled in a state high risk pool  they are not eligible for PCIP  even if that coverage does not cover their medical condition  PCIP is run by the individual states or through the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  which has a contract with the Government Employees Health Association  or GEHA  to administer benefits  Both will be funded by the federal government and provide three plan options  These options are the standard  extended  and the Health Savings Account option  PCIP only covers the individual enrollee and does not include family members or dependents  In 2014  the Affordable Care Act provision banning discrimination based on pre existing conditions will be implemented and PCIP enrollees will be transitioned into new state based health care exchanges  28  29  30   edit  Private health care coverage Private health insurance may be purchased on a group basis  e g   by a firm to cover its employees  or purchased by individual consumers  Most Americans with private health insurance receive it through an employer sponsored program  According to the United States Census Bureau  some 60  of Americans are covered through an employer  while about 9  purchase health insurance directly  31  The US has a joint federal state system for regulating insurance  with the federal government ceding primary responsibility to the states under the McCarran Ferguson Act  States regulate the content of health insurance policies and often require coverage of specific types of medical services or health care providers  32  33  State mandates generally do not apply to the health plans offered by large employers  due to the preemption clause of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act   edit  Employer sponsored Employer sponsored health insurance is paid for by businesses on behalf of their employees as part of an employee benefit package  Most private  non government  health coverage in the US is employment based  Nearly all large employers in America offer group health insurance to their employees  34  The typical large employer PPO plan is typically more generous than either Medicare or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program Standard Option  35  The employer typically makes a substantial contribution towards the cost of coverage  36  Typically  employers pay about 85  of the insurance premium for their employees  and about 75  of the premium for their employees  dependents  The employee pays the remaining fraction of the premium  usually with pre tax tax exempt earnings  These percentages have been stable since 1999  37  Health benefits provided by employers are also tax favored  Employee contributions can be made on a pre tax basis if the employer offers the benefits through a section 125 cafeteria plan  Although workers are effectively paid less than they would be  because of the cost of insurance premiums to the employer  employer sponsored health insurance offers several benefits to workers  including economies of scale  a reduction in adverse selection pressures on the insurance pool  premiums are lower when all employees participate rather than just the sickest   and reduced income taxes  8  The disadvantages include disruptions related to changing jobs  the regressive tax effect  high income workers benefit far more from the tax exemption for premiums than low income workers   and increased spending on healthcare  8  Costs for employer paid health insurance are rising rapidly  since 2001  premiums for family coverage have increased 78   while wages have risen 19  and inflation has risen 17   according to a 2007 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation  38  Employer costs have risen noticeably per hour worked  and vary significantly  In particular  average employer costs for health benefits vary by firm size and occupation  The cost per hour of health benefits is generally higher for workers in higher wage occupations  but represent a smaller percentage of payroll  39  The percentage of total compensation devoted to health benefits has been rising since the 1960s  40  Average premiums  including both the employer and employee portions  were  4 704 for single coverage and  12 680 for family coverage in 2008  37  41  However  in a 2007 analysis  the Employee Benefit Research Institute concluded that the availability of employment based health benefits for active workers in the US is stable  The  take up rate   or percentage of eligible workers participating in employer sponsored plans  has fallen somewhat  but not sharply  EBRI interviewed employers for the study  and found that others might follow if a major employer discontinued health benefits  Effective by January 1  2014  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will impose a  2000 per employee tax penalty on employers with over 50 employees who do not offer health insurance to their full time workers   In 2008  over 95  of employers with at least 50 employees offered health insurance  42   43  On the other hand  public policy changes could also result in a reduction in employer support for employment based health benefits  44  Although much more likely to offer retiree health benefits than small firms  the percentage of large firms offering these benefits fell from 66  in 1988 to 34  in 2002  34   edit  Small employer group coverage According to a 2007 study  about 59  of employers at small firms  3 199 workers  in the US provide employee health insurance  The percentage of small firms offering coverage has been dropping steadily since 1999  The study notes that cost remains the main reason cited by small firms who do not offer health benefits  45  Small firms that are new are less likely to offer coverage than ones that have been in existence for a number of years  For example  using 2005 data for firms with fewer than 10 employees  43  of those that had been in existence at least 20 years offered coverage  but only 24  of those that had been in existence less than 5 years did  The volatility of offer rates from year to year also appears to be higher for newer small businesses  46  The types of coverage available to small employers are similar to those offered by large firms  but small businesses do not have the same options for financing their benefit plans  In particular  self funded health care  whereby an employer provides health or disability benefits to employees with its own funds rather than contracting an insurance company 47   is not a practical option for most small employers  48  A RAND Corporation study published in April 2008 found that the cost of health care coverage places a greater burden on small firms  as a percentage of payroll  than on larger firms  49  A study published by the American Enterprise Institute in August 2008 examined the effect of state benefit mandates on self employed individuals  and found that  the larger the number of mandates in a state  the lower the probability that a self employed person will be a significant employment generator   50  Beneficiary cost sharing is  on average  higher among small firms than large firms  51  When small group plans are medically underwritten  employees are asked to provide health information about themselves and their covered family members when they apply for coverage  When determining rates  insurance companies use the medical information on these applications  Sometimes they will request additional information from an applicant s physician or ask the applicants for clarification   2  States regulate small group premium rates  typically by placing limits on the premium variation allowable between groups  rate bands   Insurers price to recover their costs over their entire book of small group business while abiding by state rating rules  52  Over time  the effect of initial underwriting  wears off  as the cost of a group regresses towards the mean  Recent claim experience   whether better or worse than average   is a strong predictor of future costs in the near term  But the average health status of a particular small employer group tends to regress over time towards that of an average group  53  The process used to price small group coverage changes when a state enacts small group reform laws  54  Insurance brokers play a significant role in helping small employers find health insurance  particularly in more competitive markets  Average small group commissions range from 2 percent to 8 percent of premiums  Brokers provide services beyond insurance sales  such as assisting with employee enrollment and helping to resolve benefits issues  55   edit  College sponsored health insurance for students Many colleges  universities  graduate schools  professional schools and trade schools offer a school sponsored health insurance plan  Many schools require that you enroll in the school sponsored plan unless you are able to show that you have comparable coverage from another source  Effective group health plan years beginning after September 23  2010  if an employer sponsored health plan allows employees  children to enroll in coverage  then the health plan must allow employees  adult children to enroll as well as long as the adult child is not yet age 26  Some group health insurance plans may also require that the adult child not be eligible for other group health insurance coverage  but only before 2014  56  This extension of coverage will help cover one in three young adults  according to White House documents   edit  Federal employees health benefit plan  FEHBP  In addition to such public plans as Medicare and Medicaid  the federal government also sponsors a health benefit plan for federal employees the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program  FEHBP   FEHBP provides health benefits to full time civilian employees  Active duty service members  retired service members and their dependents are covered through the Department of Defense Military Health System  MHS   FEHBP is managed by the federal Office of Personnel Management   edit   Portability  of group coverage Two federal laws address the ability of individuals with employment based health insurance coverage to maintain coverage  The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985  COBRA  enables certain individuals with employer sponsored coverage to extend their coverage if certain  qualifying events  would otherwise cause them to lose it  Employers may require COBRA qualified individuals to pay the full cost of coverage  and coverage cannot be extended indefinitely  COBRA only applies to firms with 20 or more employees  although some states also have  mini COBRA  laws that apply to small employers  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996  HIPAA  provides for forms of both  group to group  and  group to individual  portability  When an individual moves from one employer s benefit plan to another s  the new plan must count coverage under the old plan against any waiting period for pre existing conditions  as long as there is not a break in coverage of more than 63 days between the two plans  When certain qualified individuals lose group coverage altogether  they must be guaranteed access to some form of individual coverage  To qualify  they must have at least 18 months of prior continuous coverage  The details of access and the price of coverage are determined on a state by state basis   edit  Association group health insurance Regular health insurance is sometimes available to members of associations  Associations such as the American Bar Association and IEEE offer health insurance to their members  not in citation given  using an established insurance company to write the policies for a group plan  57   edit  Individually purchased Main article  Individually purchased health insurance in the United States According to the US Census Bureau  about 9  of Americans are covered under health insurance purchased directly  31  The range of products available is similar to those provided through employers  However  average out of pocket spending is higher in the individual market  with higher deductibles  co payments and other cost sharing provisions  51  58  Major medical is the most commonly purchased form of individual health insurance  Although a major medical health insurance policy is primarily a catastrophic plan  qualified preventive benefits are still covered at 100  without any waiting period or copay   59  In the individual market  the consumer pays the entire premium without benefit of an employer contribution  58  60  While self employed individuals receive a tax deduction for their health insurance and can buy health insurance with additional tax benefits  most consumers in the individual market do not receive any tax benefit  61  Premiums vary significantly by age  58  62  63  In states that allow individual medical plan underwriting  premiums also vary by health status  58  However  with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  effective by 2014  all insurers will be fully prohibited from discriminating against or charging higher rates for any individuals based on pre existing medical conditions  26  27  In August 2008  the Hartford Courant reported that competition was increasing in the individual health insurance market  with more insurers entering the market  an increased variety of products  and a broader spread of prices  64  Individual health insurance is primarily regulated at the state level  consistent with the McCarran Ferguson Act  Model acts and regulations promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners  NAIC  provide some degree of uniformity state to state  These models do not have the force of law and have no effect unless they are adopted by a state  They are  however  used as guides by most states  and some states adopt them with little or no change   edit  Types of medical insurance  edit  Traditional indemnity or fee for service Early hospital and medical plans offered by insurance companies paid either a fixed amount for specific diseases or medical procedures  schedule benefits  or a percentage of the provider s fee  The relationship between the patient and the medical provider was not changed  The patient received medical care and was responsible for paying the provider  If the service was covered by the policy  the insurance company was responsible for reimbursing or indemnifying the patient based on the provisions of the insurance contract   reimbursement benefits    Health insurance plans that are not based on a network of contracted providers  or that base payments on a percentage of provider charges  are still described as indemnity or fee for service plans  7   edit  Blue Cross Blue Shield Association Main article  Blue Cross Blue Shield Association The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association  BCBSA  is a federation of 39 separate health insurance organizations and companies in the United States  Combined  they directly or indirectly provide health insurance to over 100 million Americans  65  BCBSA insurance companies are franchisees  independent of the association  and traditionally each other   offering insurance plans within defined regions under one or both of the association s brands  Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers offer some form of health insurance coverage in every U S  state  They also act as administrators of Medicare in many states or regions of the U S   and provide coverage to state government employees as well as to the federal government employees under a nationwide option of the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan  66   edit  Health Maintenance Organizations Main article  Health Maintenance Organization A health maintenance organization  HMO  is a type of managed care organization  MCO  that provides a form of health care coverage that is fulfilled through hospitals  doctors  and other providers with which the HMO has a contract  The Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973 required employers with 25 or more employees to offer federally certified HMO options  67  Unlike traditional indemnity insurance  an HMO covers only care rendered by those doctors and other professionals who have agreed to treat patients in accordance with the HMO s guidelines and restrictions in exchange for a steady stream of customers  Benefits are provided through a network of providers  Providers may be employees of the HMO   staff model    employees of a provider group that has contracted with the HMO   group model    or members of an independent practice association   IPA model    HMOs may also use a combination of these approaches   network model    7  68   edit  Managed care Main article  Managed care The term managed care is used to describe a variety of techniques intended to reduce the cost of health benefits and improve the quality of care  It is also used to describe organizations that use these techniques   managed care organization    69  Many of these techniques were pioneered by HMOs  but they are now used in a wide variety of private health insurance programs  Through the 1990s  managed care grew from about 25  US employees with employer sponsored coverage to the vast majority  70  Rise of managed care in the US Year Conventional plans HMOs PPOs POS plans HDHP SOs 1998 14  27  35  24    1999 10  28  39  24    2000 8  29  42  21    2001 7  24  46  23    2002 4  27  52  18    2003 5  24  54  17    2004 5  25  55  15    2005 3  21  61  15    2006 3  20  60  13  4  2007 3  21  57  15  5  2008 2  20  58  12  8   edit  Network based managed care Many managed care programs are based on a panel or network of contracted health care providers  Such programs typically include  A set of selected providers that furnish a comprehensive array of health care services to enrollees  Explicit standards for selecting providers  Formal utilization review and quality improvement programs  An emphasis on preventive care  and Financial incentives to encourage enrollees to use care efficiently  Provider networks can be used to reduce costs by negotiating favorable fees from providers  selecting cost effective providers  and creating financial incentives for providers to practice more efficiently  10  A survey issued in 2009 by America s Health Insurance Plans found that patients going to out of network providers are sometimes charged extremely high fees  71  72  Network based plans may be either closed or open  With a closed network  enrollees  expenses are generally only covered when they go to network providers  Only limited services are covered outside the network typically only emergency and out of area care  Most traditional HMOs were closed network plans  Open network plans provide some coverage when an enrollee uses non network provider  generally at a lower benefit level to encourage the use of network providers  Most preferred provider organization plans are open network  those that are not are often described as exclusive provider organizations  or EPOs   as are point of service  POS  plans  The terms  open panel  and  closed panel  are sometimes used to describe which health care providers in a community have the opportunity to participate in a plan  In a  closed panel  HMO  the network providers are either HMO employees  staff model  or members of large group practices with which the HMO has a contract  In an  open panel  plan the HMO or PPO contracts with independent practitioners  opening participation in the network to any provider in the community that meets the plan s credential requirements and is willing to accept the terms of the plan s contract   edit  Other managed care techniques Other managed care techniques include such elements as disease management  case management  wellness incentives  patient education  utilization management and utilization review  These techniques can be applied to both network based benefit programs and benefit programs that are not based on a provider network  The use of managed care techniques without a provider network is sometimes described as  managed indemnity    edit  Blurring lines Over time  the operations of many Blue Cross and Blue Shield operations have become more similar to those of commercial health insurance companies  73  However  some Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans continue to serve as insurers of last resort  74  Similarly  the benefits offered by Blues plans  commercial insurers  and HMOs are converging in many respects due to market pressures  One example is the convergence of preferred provider organization  PPO  plans offered by Blues and commercial insurers and the point of service plans offered by HMOs  Historically  commercial insurers  Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans  and HMOs might be subject to different regulatory oversight in a state  e g   the Department of Insurance for insurance companies  versus the Department of Health for HMOs   Today  it is common for commercial insurance companies to have HMOs as subsidiaries  and for HMOs to have insurers as subsidiaries  the state license for an HMO is typically different from that for an insurance company   7  68  75  At one time the distinctions between traditional indemnity insurance  HMOs and PPOs were very clear  today  it can be difficult to distinguish between the products offered by the various types of organization operating in the market  76  The blurring of distinctions between the different types of health care coverage can be seen in the history of the industry s trade associations  The two primary HMO trade associations were the Group Health Association of America and the American Managed Care and Review Association  After merging  they were known as American Association of Health Plans  AAHP   The primary trade association for commercial health insurers was the Health Insurance Association of America  HIAA   These two have now merged  and are known as America s Health Insurance Plans  AHIP    edit  New types of medical plans In recent years  various new types of medical plans have been introduced  High deductible health plan  HDHP  Plans with much higher deductibles than traditional health plans   primarily providing coverage for catastrophic illness   have been introduced  77  Because of the high deductible  these provide little coverage for everyday expenses   and thus have potentially high out of pocket expenses   but do cover major expenses  Couple with these are various forms of savings plans  Tax preferenced health care spending account Coupled with high deductible plans are various tax advantaged savings plans   funds  such as salary  can be placed in a savings plan  and then go to pay the out of pocket expenses  This approach to addressing increasing premiums is dubbed  consumer driven health care   and received a boost in 2003  when President George W  Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug  Improvement  and Modernization Act  The law created tax deductible Health Savings Accounts  HSAs   untaxed private bank accounts for medical expenses  which can be established by those who already have health insurance  Withdrawals from HSAs are only penalized if the money is spent on non medical items or services  Funds can be used to pay for qualified expenses  including doctor s fees  Medicare Parts A and B  and drugs  without being taxed  78  Consumers wishing to deposit pre tax funds in an HSA must be enrolled in a high deductible insurance plan  HDHP  with a number of restrictions on benefit design  in 2007  qualifying plans must have a minimum deductible of US 1 050  Currently  the minimum deductible has risen to  1 200 for individuals and  2 400 for families  HSAs enable healthier individuals to pay less for insurance and deposit money for their own future health care  dental and vision expenses  79  HSAs are one form of tax preferenced health care spending accounts  Others include Flexible Spending Accounts  FSAs   Archer Medical Savings Accounts  MSAs   which have been superseded by the new HSAs  although existing MSAs are grandfathered   and Health Reimbursement Accounts  HRAs   These accounts are most commonly used as part of an employee health benefit package  80  While there are currently no government imposed limits to FSAs  legislation currently being reconciled between the House of Representatives and Senate would impose a cap of  2 500  While both the House and Senate bills would adjust the cap to inflation  approximately 7 million Americans who use their FSAs to cover out of pocket health care expenses greater than  2 500 would be forced to pay higher taxes and health care costs  In July 2009  Save Flexible Spending Plans  a national grassroots advocacy organization  was formed to protect against the restricted use of FSAs in health care reform efforts  Save Flexible Spending Accounts is sponsored by the Employers Council on Flexible Compensation  ECFC   a non profit organization  dedicated to the maintenance and expansion of the private employee benefits on a tax advantaged basis   81  ECFC members include companies such as WageWorks Inc   a benefits provider based in San Mateo  California  Most FSA participants are middle income Americans  earning approximately  55 000 annually  82  Individuals and families with chronic illnesses typically receive the most benefit from FSAs  even when insured  they incur annual out of pocket expenses averaging  4 398   83  Approximately 44 percent of Americans have one or more chronic conditions   84  Limited benefit plan Opposite to high deductible plans are plans which provide limited benefits   up to a low level   have also been introduced  These limited medical benefit plans pay for routine care and do not pay for catastrophic care  they do not provide equivalent financial security to a major medical plan  Annual benefit limits can be as low as  2 000  citation needed  Lifetime maximums can be very low as well  citation needed  Discount medical card One option that is becoming more popular is the discount medical card  These cards are not insurance policies  but provide access to discounts from participating health care providers  While some offer a degree of value  there are serious potential drawbacks for the consumer  85   edit  Health insurance market concentration The US health insurance market is highly concentrated  as leading insurers have carried out over 400 mergers from the mid 1990s to the mid 2000s  decade   In 2000  the two largest health insurers  Aetna and UnitedHealth Group  had total membership of 32 million  By 2006 the top two insurers  WellPoint and UnitedHealth  had total membership of 67 million  The two companies together had more than 36  of the national market for commercial health insurance  The AMA has said that it  has long been concerned about the impact of consolidated markets on patient care   A 2007 AMA study found that in 299 of the 313 markets surveyed  one health plan accounted for at least 30  of the combined health maintenance organization  HMO  preferred provider organization  PPO  market  The US Department of Justice has recognised this percentage of market control as conferring substantial monopsony power in the relations between insurer and physicians  86   edit  Other types of health insurance  non medical  While the term  health insurance  is most commonly used by the public to describe coverage for medical expenses  the insurance industry uses the term more broadly to include other related forms of coverage  such as disability income and long term care insurance   edit  Disability income insurance Main article  Disability insurance Disability income  DI  insurance pays benefits to individuals who lose their ability to work due to injury or illness  DI insurance replaces income lost while the policyholder is unable to work during a period of disability  in contrast to medical expense insurance  which pays for the cost of medical care   87  For most working age adults  the risk of disability is greater than the risk of premature death  and the resulting reduction in lifetime earnings can be significant  Private disability insurance is sold on both a group and an individual basis  Policies may be designed to cover long term disabilities  LTD coverage  or short term disabilities  STD coverage   88  Business owners can also purchase disability overhead insurance to cover the overhead expenses of their business while they are unable to work  89  A basic level of disability income protection is provided through the Social Security Disability Insurance  SSDI  program for qualified workers who are totally and permanently disabled  the worker is incapable of engaging in any  substantial gainful work  and the disability is expected to last at least 12 months or result in death    edit  Long term care insurance Main article  Long term care insurance Long term care  LTC  insurance reimburses the policyholder for the cost of long term or custodial care services designed to minimize or compensate for the loss of functioning due to age  disability or chronic illness  90  LTC has many surface similarities to long term disability insurance  There are at least two fundamental differences  however  LTC policies cover the cost of certain types of chronic care  while long term disability policies replace income lost while the policyholder is unable to work  For LTC  the event triggering benefits is the need for chronic care  while the triggering event for disability insurance is the inability to work  87  Private LTC insurance is growing in popularity in the US  Premiums have remained relatively stable in recent years  However  the coverage is quite expensive  especially when consumers wait until retirement age to purchase it  The average age of new purchasers was 61 in 2005  and has been dropping  91   edit  Supplemental coverage Private insurers offer a variety of supplemental coverages in both the group and individual markets  These are not designed to provide the primary source of medical or disability protection for an individual  but can assist with unexpected expenses and provide additional peace of mind for insureds  Supplemental coverages include Medicare supplement insurance  hospital indemnity insurance  dental insurance  vision insurance  accidental death and dismemberment insurance and specified disease insurance  7  Supplemental coverages are intended to  Supplement a primary medical expense plan by paying for expenses that are excluded or subject to the primary plan s cost sharing requirements  e g   co payments  deductibles  etc    Cover related expenses such as dental or vision care  Assist with additional expenses that may be associated with a serious illness or injury  7   edit  Medicare Supplement Coverage  Medigap  Main article  Medigap Medicare Supplement policies are designed to cover expenses not covered  or only partially covered  by the  original Medicare   Parts A  amp  B  fee for service benefits  They are only available to individuals enrolled in Medicare Parts A  amp  B  Medigap plans may be purchased on a guaranteed issue basis  no health questions asked  during a six month open enrollment period when an individual first becomes eligible for Medicare  The benefits offered by Medigap plans are standardized   edit  Hospital indemnity insurance Hospital indemnity insurance provides a fixed daily  weekly or monthly benefit while the insured is confined in a hospital  The payment is not dependent on actual hospital charges  and is most commonly expressed as a flat dollar amount  Hospital indemnity benefits are paid in addition to any other benefits that may be available  and are typically used to pay out of pocket and non covered expenses associated with the primary medical plan  and to help with additional expenses  e g   child care  incurred while in the hospital  7  68   edit  Scheduled health insurance plans Scheduled health insurance plans are an expanded form of Hospital Indemnity plans  In recent years  these plans have taken the name mini med plans or association plans  These plans may provide benefits for hospitalization  surgical  and physician services  However  they are not meant to replace a traditional comprehensive health insurance plan  Scheduled health insurance plans are more of a basic policy providing access to day to day health care such as going to the doctor or getting a prescription drug  but these benefits will be limited and are not meant to be effective for catastrophic events  Payments are based upon the plan s  schedule of benefits  and are usually paid directly to the service provider  These plans cost much less than comprehensive health insurance  Annual benefit maximums for a typical scheduled health insurance plan may range from  1 000 to  25 000  92   edit  Dental insurance Main article  Dental insurance Dental insurance helps pay for the cost of necessary dental care  Few medical expense plans include coverage for dental expenses  About 97  of dental benefits in the United States is provided through separate policies from carriers both stand alone and medical affiliates that specialize in this coverage  Typically  these dental plans offer comprehensive preventive benefits  However  major dental expenses  such as crowns and root canals  are just partially covered  Also  most carriers offer a lower rate if you select a plan that utilizes their Network providers  Discount dental programs are also available  These do not constitute insurance  but provide participants with access to discounted fees for dental work   edit  Vision care insurance Main article  Vision insurance Vision care insurance provides coverage for routine eye care and is typically written to complement other medical benefits  Vision benefits are designed to encourage routine eye examinations and ensure that appropriate treatment is provided  7   edit  Specified disease Main article  Critical illness insurance Specified disease provides benefits for one or more specifically identified conditions  Benefits can be used to fill gaps in a primary medical plan  such as co payments and deductibles  or to assist with additional expenses such as transportation and child care costs  7   edit  Accidental death and dismemberment insurance Main article  Accidental death and dismemberment insurance AD amp D insurance is offered by group insurers and provides benefits in the event of accidental death  It also provides benefits for certain specified types of bodily injuries  e g   loss of a limb or loss of sight  when they are the direct result of an accident  7   edit  Status of the uninsured The numbers of uninsured Americans and the uninsured rate from 1987 to 2008 Percentage of people without health insurance coverage by state in 2009  Main article  Uninsured in the United States Based on self reported census data  in 2007  more than 45 million people in the US  15 3  of the population  were without health insurance as defined in the questions asked  The percentage of the non elderly population who are uninsured has been generally increasing since the year 2000  3  Among the uninsured population  some 37 million were employment age adults  ages 18 to 64   and more than 27 million worked at least part time  About 38  of the uninsured live in households with incomes over  50 000  31  According to the Census Bureau  nearly 36 million of the uninsured are legal US citizens  Another 9 7 million are non citizens  but the Census Bureau does not distinguish in its estimate between legal non citizens and illegal immigrants  31  It has been estimated that nearly one fifth of the uninsured population is able to afford insurance  almost one quarter is eligible for public coverage  and the remaining 56  need financial assistance  8 9  of all Americans   93  An estimated 5 million of those without health insurance are considered  uninsurable  because of pre existing conditions  23  The costs of treating the uninsured must often be absorbed by providers as charity care  passed on to the insured via cost shifting and higher health insurance premiums  or paid by taxpayers through higher taxes  94  A report published by the Kaiser Family Foundation in April 2008 found that economic downturns place a significant strain on state Medicaid and SCHIP programs  The authors estimated that a 1  increase in the unemployment rate would increase Medicaid and SCHIP enrollment by 1 million  and increase the number uninsured by 1 1 million  State spending on Medicaid and SCHIP would increase by  1 4 billion  total spending on these programs would increase by  3 4 billion   This increased spending would occur at the same time state government revenues were declining  During the last downturn  the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003  JGTRRA  included federal assistance to states  which helped states avoid tightening their Medicaid and SCHIP eligibility rules  The authors conclude that Congress should consider similar relief for the current economic downturn  95   edit  Death Since people who lack health insurance are unable to obtain timely medical care  they have a 40 percent higher risk of death in any given year than those with health insurance  according to a study published in the American Journal of Public Health  The study estimated that in 2005 in the United States  there were 45 000 deaths associated with lack of health insurance  96   edit  Criticism of health insurance in the United States The United States  system of using health insurance as a means of financing health care costs has been criticized  The following are examples of such criticisms While  private plans are attractive because of their ability to be responsive to consumer demands for choice and their innovations resulting from both the profit motive and desire to attract a larger enrollment base   they also have disadvantages  Industry consolidation  has not led to strong insurers who are willing or able to negotiate effectively with dominant hospital systems   and   i nsurance markets have become dominated by a small number of large insurers  with  shadow pricing  by smaller insurers  97  Insurance companies have high administrative costs  98  Private health insurers are a significant portion of the U S  economy directly employing  in 2004  almost 470 000 people at an average salary of  61 409  99  Health insurance companies are not actually providing traditional insurance  which involves the pooling of risk  because the vast majority of purchasers actually do face the harms that they are  insuring  against  Instead  as Edward Beiser and Jacob Appel have separately argued  health insurers are better thought of as low risk money managers who pocket the interest on what are really long term healthcare savings accounts  100  101  According to a study by a pro health reform group published February 11  the nation s largest five health insurance companies posted a 56 percent gain in 2009 profits over 2008  The insurers  Wellpoint  UnitedHealth  Cigna  Aetna and Humana  cover the majority of Americans with health insurance  102   edit  See also America s Health Insurance Plans COBRA Economic capital Health care reform in the United States Healthcare reform Health economics Health
