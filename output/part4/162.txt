Republic of the Philippines  Filipino  Republika ng Pilipinas  is a sovereign country in Southeast Asia in the western Pacific Ocean  To its north across the Luzon Strait lies Taiwan  West across the South China Sea sits Vietnam  The Sulu Sea to the southwest lies between the country and the island of Borneo  and to the south the Celebes Sea separates it from other islands of Indonesia  It is bounded on the east by the Philippine Sea  Its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire and its tropical climate make the Philippines prone to earthquakes and typhoons but have also endowed the country with natural resources and made it one of the richest areas of biodiversity in the world  An archipelago comprising 7 107 islands  the Philippines is categorized broadly into three main geographical divisions  Luzon  Visayas  and Mindanao  Its capital city is Manila  With an estimated population of about 94 million people  the Philippines is the world s 12th most populous country  An additional 11 million Filipinos live overseas  Multiple ethnicities and cultures are found throughout the islands  In prehistoric times  Negritos were some of the archipelago s earliest inhabitants  They were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples who brought with them influences from Malay  Hindu  and Islamic societies  Trade introduced Chinese cultural influences which remain to this day  The Philippines has been part of several empires  the Spanish Empire during the age of Imperialism  the United States after the Spanish American War of 1898  and the Japanese Empire during World War II  until the official Philippine independence in 1945  The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521 marked the beginning of an era of Spanish interest and eventual colonization  In 1543  Spanish explorer Ruy L pez de Villalobos named the archipelago Las Islas Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain  Miguel L pez de Legazpi arrived in the Philippines in 1565 and consolidated Spanish rule in the islands  which remained a colony of Spain for more than 300 years  Manila became the Asian hub of the Manila Acapulco galleon fleet  Christianity was widely adopted  As the 19th century gave way to the 20th  there followed in quick succession the Philippine Revolution  which spawned the short lived First Philippine Republic  the Spanish American War  and the Philippine American War  In the aftermath  the United States emerged as the dominant power  Aside from the period of Japanese occupation  the United States retained sovereignty over the islands until the end of World War II when the Philippines gained independence  The United States bequeathed to the Philippines the English language and a stronger affinity for Western culture  Since independence the Philippines has had an often tumultuous experience with democracy  with popular  people power  movements overthrowing a dictatorship in one instance but also underlining the institutional weaknesses of its constitutional republic in others  Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 3 Politics and government 3 1 Security and defense 3 2 International relations 3 3 Administrative divisions 4 Geography 4 1 Flora and fauna 4 2 Climate 5

Philip II of Spain  Spanish explorer Ruy L pez de Villalobos during his expedition in 1542 named the islands of Leyte and Samar Felipinas after the then Prince of Asturias  Eventually the name Las Islas Filipinas would be used to cover all the islands of the archipelago  Before it became commonplace  other names such as Islas del Poniente  Islands of the West  and Magellan s name for the islands San L zaro were also used by the Spanish to refer to the islands  11  12  13  14  15  The official name of the Philippines has changed several times in the course of the country s history  During the Philippine Revolution  the Malolos Congress proclaimed the establishment of the Rep blica Filipina or the Philippine Republic  From the period of the Spanish American War and the Philippine American War until the Commonwealth period  American colonial authorities referred to the country as the Philippine Islands  a translation of the Spanish name  During the American period the name Philippines began to appear and it has since become the country s common name  16  Since independence the official name of the country has been the Republic of the Philippines  History Main article  History of the Philippines A page from the Boxer Codex  Left  is a general from the Rajahnate of Butuan and to the right is a princess of Tondo  The metatarsal of Callao Man is reported to have been reliably dated by uranium series dating to 67 000 years ago 17  thereby replacing the Tabon Man of Palawan  carbon dated to around 24 000 years ago 18  19  as the oldest human remains found in the archipelago  Negritos were among the archipelago s earliest inhabitants but their appearance in the Philippines has not been reliably dated  20  There are several opposing theories regarding the origins of ancient Filipinos  F  Landa Jocano theorizes that the ancestors of the Filipinos evolved locally  Wilhelm Solheim s Island Origin Theory 21  postulates that the peopling of the archipelago transpired via trade networks originating in the antediluvian Sundaland area around 48000 to 5000 BCE rather than by wide scale migration  The Austronesian Expansion Theory states that Malayo Polynesians coming from Taiwan began migrating to the Philippines around 4000 BCE  displacing earlier arrivals  22  23  Whatever the case  by 1000 BCE the inhabitants of the archipelago had developed into four kinds of social groups  hunter gathering tribes  warrior societies  petty plutocracies  and maritime centered harbor principalities  24  Trade between the maritime oriented peoples and other Asian countries during the subsequent period brought influences from Hinduism  Buddhism  and Islam  During this time there was no unifying political state encompassing the entire Philippine Archipelago  Instead  the islands were divided among competing thalassocracies ruled by various datus  rajahs  or sultans  These thalassocracies were composed of autonomous barangays which were independent to or allied with larger nations  Among them were the kingdoms of Maynila  Namayan  and Tondo  the confederation of Madyaas  the state of Ma i  the rajahnates of Butuan and Cebu  and the sultanates of Maguindanao and Sulu  25  26  27  28  Some of these societies were part of the Malayan empires of Srivijaya  Majapahit  and Brunei  29  30  Islam was brought to the Philippines by traders and proselytizers from Malaysia and Indonesia  31  By the 15th century  Islam was established in the Sulu Archipelago and by 1565 had reached Mindanao  the Visayas  and Luzon  32  Ferdinand Magellan  the first European colonizer who claimed the Philippines for Spain In 1521  Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan arrived in the Philippines and claimed the islands for Spain  33  Colonization began when Spanish explorer Miguel L pez de Legazpi arrived from Mexico in 1565 and formed the first European settlements in Cebu  In 1571  after dealing with the local royal families in the wake of the Tondo Conspiracy and defeating the Chinese pirate warlord Limahong  the Spanish established Manila as the capital of the Spanish East Indies  34  35  Spanish rule contributed significantly to bringing political unity to the archipelago  From 1565 to 1821  the Philippines was governed as a territory of the Viceroyalty of New Spain and then was administered directly from Madrid after the Mexican War of Independence  The Manila galleons linking Manila to Acapulco traveled once or twice a year between the 16th and 19th centuries  Trade introduced foods such as corn  tomatoes  potatoes  chili peppers  and pineapples from the Americas  35 Roman Catholic missionaries converted most of the lowland inhabitants to Christianity and founded schools  a university  and hospitals  While a Spanish decree introduced free public schooling in 1863  efforts in mass public education mainly came to fruition during the American period  36  During its rule  the Spanish fought off various indigenous revolts and several external colonial challenges from Chinese pirates  the Dutch  and the Portuguese  In an extension of the fighting of the Seven Years  War  British forces under the command of Brigadier General William Draper and Rear Admiral Samuel Cornish briefly occupied Manila  They found local allies like Diego and Gabriela Silang who took the opportunity to lead a revolt  but Spanish rule was eventually restored following the 1763 Treaty of Paris  31  37  38  In the 19th century  Philippine ports were opened to world trade and shifts were occurring within Philippine society  Many Spaniards born in the Philippines  criollos  and those of mixed ancestry  mestizos  became wealthy  The influx of Spanish and Latino settlers secularized churches and opened up government positions traditionally held by Spaniards born in the Iberian Peninsula  peninsulares   The ideals of revolution also began to spread through the islands  Criollo dissatisfaction resulted in the revolt in Cavite El Viejo in 1872 that was a precursor to the Philippine Revolution  31  39  40  41  42  Jos  Rizal  Marcelo del Pilar  and Mariano Ponce  leaders of the Propaganda Movement Revolutionary sentiments were stoked in 1872 after three priests Mariano G mez  Jos  Burgos  and Jacinto Zamora  collectively known as Gomburza  were accused of sedition by colonial authorities and executed  39  40  This would inspire a propaganda movement in Spain  organized by Marcelo H  del Pilar  Jos  Rizal  and Mariano Ponce  lobbying for political reforms in the Philippines  Rizal was eventually executed on December 30  1896  on charges of rebellion  43  As attempts at reform were meeting with resistance  Andr s Bonifacio in 1892 established the secret society called the Katipunan  a society along the lines of the freemasons  which sought independence from Spain through armed revolt  41  Bonifacio and the Katipunan started the Philippine Revolution in 1896  A faction of the Katipunan  the Magdalo of Cavite province  eventually came to challenge Bonifacio s position as the leader of the revolution and Emilio Aguinaldo took over  In 1898  the Spanish American War began in Cuba and reached the Philippines  Aguinaldo declared Philippine independence from Spain in Kawit  Cavite on June 12  1898 and the First Philippine Republic was established the following year  Meanwhile  the islands were ceded by Spain to the United States for US 20 million in the 1898 Treaty of Paris  44  As it became increasingly clear the United States would not recognize the First Philippine Republic  the Philippine American War broke out  It ended with American control over the islands which were then administered as an insular area  45  In 1935  the Philippines was granted Commonwealth status  Plans for independence over the next decade were interrupted by World War II when the Japanese Empire invaded and established a puppet government  Many atrocities and war crimes were committed during the war such as the Bataan Death March and the Manila massacre that culminated during the Battle of Manila  46  Allied troops defeated the Japanese in 1945  By the end of the war it is estimated over a million Filipinos had died  47  A statue of the Virgin Mary built at the EDSA Shrine after the People Power Revolution On July 4  1946  the Philippines attained its independence  5  Immediately after World War II  the Philippines faced a number of challenges  The country had to be rebuilt from the ravages of war  It also had to come to terms with Japanese collaborators  Meanwhile  disgruntled remnants of the Hukbalahap communist rebel army that had previously fought against and resisted the Japanese continued to roam the rural regions  Eventually this threat was dealt with by Secretary of National Defense and later President Ramon Magsaysay but sporadic cases of communist insurgency continued to flare up long afterward  48  49  In 1965  Ferdinand Marcos was elected president  his wife Imelda Marcos at his side  Nearing the end of his second term and constitutionally barred from seeking a third  he declared martial law on September 21  1972  By using political divisions  the tension of the Cold War  and the specter of communist rebellion and Islamic insurgency as justifications  he was able to govern by decree  50  On August 21  1983  Marcos  chief rival opposition leader Benigno  Ninoy  Aquino  Jr  ignored warnings and returned from exile in the United States  He was assassinated as he was taken off the plane at the Manila International Airport  now called the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in his memory   With political pressure building  Marcos eventually called for snap presidential elections in 1986  48 Corazon Aquino  Benigno s widow  was persuaded to become the presidential candidate and standard bearer of the opposition  The elections were widely thought of as rigged when Marcos was proclaimed the winner  This led to the People Power Revolution  instigated when two long time Marcos allies Armed Forces of the Philippines Vice Chief of Staff Fidel V  Ramos and Secretary of National Defense Juan Ponce Enrile resigned and barricaded themselves in Camp Aguinaldo and Camp Crame  Exhorted by the Cardinal Archbishop of Manila Jaime Sin  people gathered in support of the rebel leaders and protested on Epifanio de los Santos Avenue  EDSA   In the face of mass protests and military defections  Marcos and his allies fled to Hawaii and into exile  Corazon Aquino was recognized as president  49  51  The return of democracy and government reforms after the events of 1986 were hampered by national debt  government corruption  coup attempts  a persistent communist insurgency  and Islamic separatists  The economy improved during the administration of Fidel V  Ramos  who was elected president in 1992  52  However  the economic improvements were negated with the onset of the East Asian financial crisis in 1997  In 2001  amid charges of corruption and a stalled impeachment process  Ramos  successor Joseph Estrada was ousted from the presidency by the 2001 EDSA Revolution and replaced by Gloria Macapagal Arroyo  As a result of the May 2010 elections  Benigno  Noynoy  Aquino III was elected president  Politics and government Main articles  Politics of the Philippines  President of the Philippines  and Constitution of the Philippines Benigno S  Aquino III  the current and 15th president of the Republic of the Philippines The Philippines has a democratic government  53  It is a constitutional republic with a presidential system  It is governed as a unitary state with the exception of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao which is largely free from the national government  The President functions as both head of state and head of government and is the commander in chief of the armed forces  The president is elected by popular vote for a single six year term  during which he or she appoints and presides over the cabinet  3  The bicameral Congress is composed of the Senate  serving as the upper house  with members elected to a six year term  and the House of Representatives  serving as the lower house  with members elected to a three year term  The senators are elected at large while the representatives are elected from both legislative districts and through sectoral representation  3  The judicial power is vested in the Supreme Court  composed of a Chief Justice as its presiding officer and fourteen associate justices  all of whom are appointed by the President from nominations submitted by the Judicial and Bar Council  3  There have been attempts to change the government to a federal  unicameral  or parliamentary government since the Ramos administration  54  55  Security and defense Main articles  Armed Forces of the Philippines and Philippine National Police BRP Gregorio del Pilar  a Hamilton class cutter of the Philippine Navy Philippine defense is handled by the Armed Forces of the Philippines and is composed of three branches  the Air Force  the Army  and the Navy  including the Marine Corps   Civilian security is handled by Philippine National Police under the Department of the Interior and Local Government  DILG   In the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao  the largest separatist organization  the Moro National Liberation Front  is now engaging the government politically  Other more militant groups like the Moro Islamic Liberation Front  the communist New People s Army  and the Abu Sayyaf still roam the provinces  but their presence has decreased in recent years due to successful security provided by the Philippine government  56  57  The Philippines has been an ally of the United States since World War II  A mutual defense treaty between the two countries was signed in 1951  The Philippines supported American policies during the Cold War and participated in the Korean and Vietnam wars  It was a member of the now dissolved SEATO  a group that was intended to serve a role similar to NATO and that included Australia  France  New Zealand  Pakistan  Thailand  the United Kingdom  and the United States  58  After the start of the War on Terror  the Philippines was part of the coalition that gave support to the United States in Iraq  59  The United States designated the country a major non NATO ally  The Philippines is currently working to end its domestic insurgency with help from the United States  International relations The Philippine Embassy in Washington D C   United States  Main article  Foreign relations of the Philippines The Philippines  international relations are based on trade with other nations and the well being of the 11 million overseas Filipinos living outside the country  60  As a founding and active member of the United Nations  the Philippines has been elected several times into the Security Council  Carlos P  Romulo was a former President of the United Nations General Assembly  The country is an active participant in the Human Rights Council as well as in peacekeeping missions  particularly in East Timor  61  62  63  64  In addition to membership in the United Nations  the country is also a founding and active member of ASEAN  Association of Southeast Asian Nations   an organization designed to strengthen relations and promote economic and cultural growth among states in the Southeast Asian region  65  It has hosted several summits and is an active contributor to the direction and policies of the bloc  66  The relations it currently enjoys with other Southeast Asian states are in contrast to its relations with them before the 1970s when it was at war with Vietnam and was heavily disputing Sabah with Malaysia  although  disagreements continue to exist due to the Spratly Islands  67  The Philippines values its relations with the United States  60  It supported the United States during the Cold War and the War on Terror and is a major non NATO ally  Despite this history of goodwill  controversies related to the presence of the now former U S  military bases in Subic Bay and Clark and the current Visiting Forces Agreement have flared up from time to time  60 Japan  the biggest contributor of official development assistance to the country  68  is thought of as a friend  Although historical tensions still exist on issues such as the plight of comfort women much of the animosity inspired by memories of World War II have faded  69  Relations with other nations are generally positive  Shared democratic values ease relations with Western and European countries while similar economic concerns help in relations with other developing countries  Historical ties and cultural similarities also serve as a bridge in relations with Spain and Latin America  Despite issues such as domestic abuse and war affecting overseas Filipino workers and obstacles posed by Islamic insurgency in Mindanao  relations with Middle Eastern countries  including Egypt  Iran  Iraq  Libya  Saudi Arabia  and the United Arab Emirates  are friendly as seen in the continuous employment of more than two million overseas Filipinos living there  With communism no longer the threat it once was  once hostile relations in the 1950s between the Philippines and the People s Republic of China have improved greatly  Issues involving Taiwan  the Spratly Islands  and concerns of expanding Chinese influence  however  still encourage a degree of carefulness  69  Recent foreign policy has been mostly about economic relations with its Southeast Asian and Asia Pacific neighbors  60  The Philippines is a member of the East Asia Summit  EAS   the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation  APEC   the Latin Union  the Group of 24  and the Non Aligned Movement  3  It is also seeking to strengthen relations with Islamic countries by campaigning for observer status in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation  70  71

islands 3  with a total land area  including inland bodies of water  of approximately 300 000 square kilometers  120 000 sq mi   Its 36 289 kilometers  22 549 mi  of coastline makes it the country with the 5th longest coastline in the world  3  74  It is located between 116  40   and 126  34  E  longitude and 4  40  and 21  10  N  latitude and is bordered by the Philippine Sea to the east  the South China Sea to the west  and the Celebes Sea to the south  The island of Borneo is located a few hundred kilometers southwest and Taiwan is located directly to the north  The Moluccas and Sulawesi are located to the south southwest and Palau is located to the east of the islands  3  Most of the mountainous islands are covered in tropical rainforest and volcanic in origin  The highest mountain is Mount Apo  It measures up to 2 954 meters  9 692 feet  above sea level and is located on the island of Mindanao  The Galathea Depth in the Philippine Trench is the deepest point in the country and the third deepest in the world  The trench is located in the Philippine Sea  The longest river is the Cagayan River in northern Luzon  Manila Bay  upon the shore of which the capital city of Manila lies  is connected to Laguna de Bay  the largest lake in the Philippines  by the Pasig River  Subic Bay  the Davao Gulf  and the Moro Gulf are other important bays  The San Juanico Strait separates the islands of Samar and Leyte but it is traversed by the San Juanico Bridge  75    The template below  Wide image  is being considered for merging  See templates for discussion to help reach a consensus    Ancient Filipinos utilized terrace farming to grow crops in the steep mountainous regions of northern Philippines  Situated on the western fringes of the Pacific Ring of Fire  the Philippines experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity  The Benham Plateau to the east in the Philippine Sea is an undersea region active in tectonic subduction  76  Around 20 earthquakes are registered daily  though most are too weak to be felt  The last major earthquake was the 1990 Luzon earthquake  77  There are many active volcanoes such as the Mayon Volcano  Mount Pinatubo  and Taal Volcano  The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991 produced the second largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century  78  Not all notable geographic features are so violent or destructive  A more serene legacy of the geological disturbances is the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River  The white sand beaches that make Boracay a popular vacation getaway are made of coral remnants  Due to the volcanic nature of the islands  mineral deposits are abundant  The country is estimated to have the second largest gold deposits after South Africa and one of the largest copper deposits in the world  79  It is also rich in nickel  chromite  and zinc  Despite this  poor management  high population density  and environmental consciousness have resulted in these mineral resources remaining largely untapped  79 Geothermal energy  however  is another product of volcanic activity that the country has harnessed more successfully  The Philippines is the world s second biggest geothermal producer behind the United States  with 18  of the country s electricity needs being met by geothermal power  80  Flora and fauna Main article  Wildlife of the Philippines The Philippines  rainforests and its extensive coastlines make it home to a diverse range of birds  plants  animals  and sea creatures  81  It is one of the ten most biologically mega diverse countries and is at or near the top in terms of biodiversity per unit area  82  83  84  Around 1 100 land vertebrate species can be found in the Philippines including over 100 mammal species and 170 bird species not thought to exist elsewhere  85 Endemic species include the tamaraw of Mindoro  the Visayan spotted deer  the Philippine mouse deer  the Visayan warty pig  the Philippine flying lemur  and several species of bats  86  Philippine tarsier  Tarsius syrichta   one of the smallest primates  The Philippines lacks large predators  with the exception of snakes  such as pythons and cobras  and birds of prey  such as the national bird  known as the Philippine eagle  87  Other native animals include the palm civet cat  the dugong  and the Philippine tarsier associated with Bohol  With an estimated 13 500 plant species in the country  3 200 of which are unique to the islands  85  Philippine rainforests boast an array of flora  including many rare types of orchids and rafflesia  88  89  The narra is considered as the most important type of hardwood  90  Philippine maritime waters encompass as much as 2 2 million square kilometers  850 000 square miles  producing unique and diverse marine life and is an important part of the Coral Triangle  73  There are 2 400 fish species and over 500 species of coral  81  85  The Apo Reef is the country s largest contiguous coral reef system and the second largest in the world  91  Philippine waters also sustain the cultivation of pearls  crabs  and seaweeds  81  92  Deforestation  often the result of illegal logging  is an acute problem in the Philippines  Forest cover declined from 70  of the country s total land area in 1900 to about 18 3  in 1999  93  94  Many species are endangered and scientists say that Southeast Asia  which the Philippines is part of  faces a catastrophic extinction rate of 20  by the end of the century  95  According to Conservation International   the country is one of the few nations that is  in its entirety  both a hotspot and a megadiversity country  placing it among the top priority hotspots for global conservation   88  Climate Typhoon Megi over the Philippines  Main article  Climate of the Philippines The Philippines has a tropical maritime climate and is usually hot and humid  There are three seasons  tag init or tag araw  the hot dry season or summer from March to May  tag ulan  the rainy season from June to November  and tag lamig  the cool dry season from December to February  The southwest monsoon  from May to October  is known as the Habagat  and the dry winds of the northeast monsoon  from November to April   the Amihan  96  Temperatures usually range from 21 C  70 F  to 32 C  90 F  although it can get cooler or hotter depending on the season  The coolest month is January  the warmest is May  3  97  The average yearly temperature is around 26 6 C  79 88 F   96  In considering temperature  location in terms of latitude and longitude is not a significant factor  Whether in the extreme north  south  east  or west of the country  temperatures at sea level tend to be in the same range  Altitude usually has more of an impact  The average annual temperature of Baguio at an elevation of 1 500 meters  4 900 feet  above sea level is 18 3 C  64 9 F   making it a popular destination during hot summers  96  Likewise  Tagaytay is a favored retreat  Sitting astride the typhoon belt  most of the islands experience annual torrential rains and thunderstorms from July to October  98  with around nineteen typhoons entering the Philippine area of responsibility in a typical year and eight or nine making landfall  99  100  101  Annual rainfall measures as much as 5 000 millimeters  200 inches  in the mountainous east coast section but less than 1 000 millimeters  39 inches  in some of the sheltered valleys  98  The wettest known tropical cyclone to impact the archipelago was the July 1911 cyclone  which dropped over 1 168 millimetres  46 0 in  of rainfall within a 24 hour period in Baguio City  102 Bagyo is the local term for a tropical cyclone in the Philippines  102  Economy Main article  Economy of the Philippines The national economy of the Philippines is the 45th largest in the world  with an estimated 2011 gross domestic product  nominal  of  216 billion  8  Primary exports include semiconductors and electronic products  transport equipment  garments  copper products  petroleum products  coconut oil  and fruits  5  Major trading partners include the United States  Japan  China  Singapore  South Korea  the Netherlands  Hong Kong  Germany  Taiwan  and Thailand  5

economic growth and bouts of economic recession  Only in the 1990s with a program of economic liberalization did the economy begin to recover  60  107  The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis affected the economy  resulting in a lingering decline of the value of the peso and falls in the stock market  But the extent it was affected initially was not as severe as that of some of its Asian neighbors  This was largely due to the fiscal conservatism of the government  partly as a result of decades of monitoring and fiscal supervision from the International Monetary Fund  IMF   in comparison to the massive spending of its neighbors on the rapid acceleration of economic growth  52  There have been signs of progress since  In 2004  the economy experienced 6 4  GDP growth and 7 1  in 2007  its

uneven with Luzon Metro Manila in particular gaining most of the new economic growth at the expense of the other regions  113  although the government has taken steps to distribute economic growth by promoting investment in other areas of the country  Despite constraints  service industries such as tourism and business process outsourcing have been identified as areas with some of the best opportunities for growth for the country  104  114 Goldman Sachs includes the country in its list of the  Next Eleven  economies  115  But China and India have emerged as major economic competitors

Church in Malolos  Bulacan where the First Philippine Republic was founded  One of the most visible Hispanic legacies is the prevalence of Spanish names and surnames among Filipinos  However  a Spanish name and surname does not necessarily denote Spanish ancestry  This peculiarity  unique among the people of Asia  came as a result of a colonial decree  the Claver a edict  for the systematic distribution of family names and implementation of the Spanish naming system on the population  174  The names of many streets  towns  and provinces are also in Spanish  Spanish architecture has left an imprint in the Philippines in the way many towns were designed around a central square or plaza mayor  but many of the buildings bearing its influence were demolished during World War II  25  Some
