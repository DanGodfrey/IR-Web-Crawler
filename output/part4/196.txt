the United States Congress was considering organizing a new territory in the Rocky Mountains  eccentric lobbyist George M  Willing suggested the name  Idaho   which he claimed was derived from a Shoshone language term meaning  the sun comes from the mountains  or  gem of the mountains   Willing later claimed that he had made up the name himself  7  8  Congress ultimately decided to name the area Colorado Territory when it was created in February 1861  Thinking they would get a jump on the name  locals named a community in Colorado  Idaho Springs   Lake Coeur d Alene in North Idaho However  the name  Idaho  did not go away  The same year Congress created Colorado Territory  a county called Idaho County was created in eastern Washington Territory  The county was named after a steamship named Idaho  which was launched on the Columbia River in 1860  It is unclear whether the steamship was named before or after Willing s claim was revealed  Regardless  a portion of Washington Territory  including Idaho County  was used to create Idaho Territory in 1863  Despite this lack of evidence for the origin of the name  many textbooks well into the 20th century repeated as fact Willing s account that the name  Idaho  derived from the Shoshone term  ee da how   The name  Idaho  may be derived from the Plains Apache word   daah    which means  enemy   The Comanches used this word to refer to the Idaho Territory  9  An excerpt from a 1956 Idaho History Textbook   Idaho  is a Shoshoni Indian exclamation  The word consists of three parts  The first is  Ee   which in English conveys the idea of  coming down   The second is  dah  which is the Shoshoni stem or root for both  sun  and  mountain   The third syllable   how   denotes the exclamation and stands for the same thing in Shoshoni that the exclamation mark     does in the English language  The Shoshoni word is  Ee dah how   and the Indian thought thus conveyed when translated into English means   Behold  the sun coming down the mountain   10   edit  Geography Digitally colored elevation map of Idaho  Sixty percent of Idaho s land is held by the National Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management  and

Oregon are to the west  Nevada and Utah are to the south  and Montana and Wyoming are to the east  Idaho also shares a short border with the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north  The landscape is rugged with some of the largest unspoiled natural areas in the United States  For example  at 2 3 million acres  9 300 km    the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness Area is the largest contiguous area of protected wilderness in the continental United States  Idaho is a Rocky Mountain state with abundant natural resources and scenic areas  The state has snow capped mountain ranges  rapids  vast lakes and steep canyons  The waters of the Snake River rush through Hells Canyon  the deepest gorge in the United States  The Shoshone Falls in southern Idaho  Shoshone Falls plunges down rugged cliffs from a height greater than that of Niagara Falls  The major rivers in Idaho are the Snake River  the Clark Fork Pend Oreille River  the Clearwater River  the Salmon River  Other significant rivers include the Coeur d Alene River  the Spokane River  the Boise River  and the Payette River  The Salmon River empties into the Snake in Hells Canyon and forms the southern boundary of Nez Perce County on its north shore  of which Lewiston is the county seat  The Port of Lewiston  at the confluence of the Clearwater and the Snake Rivers is the farthest inland seaport on the West Coast at 465 river miles from the Pacific at Astoria  Oregon  13  Idaho s highest point is Borah Peak  12 662 ft  3 859 m   in the Lost River Range north of Mackay  Idaho s lowest point  710 ft  216 m   is in Lewiston  where the Clearwater River joins the Snake River and continues into Washington  The Sawtooth Range is often considered Idaho s most famous mountain range  14  Other mountain ranges in Idaho include the Bitterroot Range  the White Cloud Mountains  the Lost River Range  the Clearwater Mountains  and the Salmon River Mountains  Map of Idaho Southern Idaho  including the Boise metropolitan area  Idaho Falls  Pocatello  and Twin Falls are in the Mountain Time Zone   A legislative oddity  15 U S C  ch 6  264  theoretically placed this region in the Central Time Zone

commercially and culturally around Washington State through the second largest city  Spokane  Washington   edit  Climate Idaho has much variation in its climate  Although the state s western border is located about 350 miles  560 km  from the Pacific Ocean  the maritime influence is still felt in Idaho  especially in the winter when cloud cover  humidity  and precipitation are at their maximum extent  This influence has a moderating effect in the winter where temperatures are not as low as would otherwise be expected for a northern state with a predominantly elevated altitude  16  The maritime influence is least prominent in the eastern part of the state where the precipitation patterns are often reversed  with wetter summers and drier winters  and seasonal temperature differences more extreme  showing a more semi arid continental climate  Climate in Idaho can be hot  although extended periods over 100  F  38  C  for the maximum temperature are rare  except for the lowest point in elevation  Lewiston  which correspondingly sees very little snow  Hot summer days are tempered by the low relative humidity and cooler evenings during summer months since  for most of the state  the highest diurnal difference in temperature is often in the summer  Winters can be cold  although extended periods of bitter cold weather below zero are unusual  This is what led the railroad tycoon Harriman family to develop the most famous ski resort  Sun Valley  Idaho s all time highest temperature of 118  F  48  C  was recorded at Orofino on July 28  1934  the all time lowest temperature of

including arrowheads  that rank among the oldest dated artifacts in North America  American Indian peoples predominant in the area included the Nez Perce in the north and the Northern and Western Shoshone in the south  An early presence of French Canadian trappers is visible in names and toponyms that have survived to this day  Nez Perc   Coeur d Al ne  Bois   Payette  some preexisting the Lewis and Clark and Astorian expeditions which themselves included significant numbers of French and Metis guides recruited for their familiarity with the terrain  Idaho  as part of the Oregon Country  was claimed by both the United States and Great Britain until the United States gained undisputed jurisdiction in 1846  From 1843 to 1849 present day Idaho was under the de facto jurisdiction of the Provisional Government of Oregon  When Oregon became a state  what is now Idaho was in what was left of the original Oregon Territory not part of the new state  and designated as the Washington Territory  Between then and the creation of the Idaho Territory on July 4  1863 at Lewiston  parts of the present day state were included in the Oregon  Washington  and Dakota Territories  The new territory included present day Idaho  Montana  and most of Wyoming  The Lewis and Clark expedition crossed Idaho in 1805 on the way to the Pacific and in 1806 on the return  largely following the Clearwater River both directions  The first non indigenous settlement was Kullyspell House  established on the shore of Lake Pend Oreille for fur trading in 1809 by David Thompson of the North West Company  17  18  In 1812 Donald Mackenzie  working for the Pacific Fur Company at the time  established a post on the lower Clearwater River near present day Lewiston  This post  known as  MacKenzie s Post  or  Clearwater   operated until the Pacific Fur Company was bought out by the North West Company in 1813  after which it was abandoned  19  20  The first attempts at organized communities  within the present borders of Idaho  were established in 1860  21  22  The first permanent  substantial incorporated community was Lewiston in 1861  After some tribulation as a territory  including the illegal and chaotic transfer of the territorial capital from Lewiston in December 1864 to Boise in January 1865  disenfranchisement of Mormon polygamists upheld by the U S  Supreme Court in 1877  23  and a federal attempt to split the territory between Washington Territory which gained statehood in 1889  a year before Idaho  and the state of Nevada which had been a state since 1863  Idaho achieved statehood in 1890  The economy of the state  which had been primarily supported by metal mining  shifted towards agriculture  forest products and tourism  In recent years  Idaho has expanded its commercial base as a tourism and agricultural state to include science and technology industries  Science and technology have become the largest single economic center  over 25  of the state s total revenue  within the state and are greater than agriculture  forestry and mining combined  24  The Idaho State Historical Society and numerous local historical societies and museums preserve and

 In keeping with this  while there are no large wineries or breweries in Idaho  there are numerous and growing numbers of award winning boutique wineries and microbreweries in the northern part of the state  Today  the largest industry in Idaho is the science and technology sector  It accounts for over 25  of the State s total revenue and 70   of the State s exports  in dollars   Idaho s industrial

development of renewable energy systems  The state is rich in renewable energy resources but has limited fossil fuel resources  The Snake River Plain and smaller river basins provide Idaho with some of the best hydroelectric power resources in the nation and its geologically active mountain areas have significant geothermal power and wind power potential  These realities have shaped much of the state s current energy landscape  Most of the energy consumed in Idaho is imported from other states  Imports account for more than 80  of total energy consumption  including all of Idaho s natural gas and petroleum supplies and more than half of its electricity  Of the electricity consumed in Idaho in 2005  48  came from hydroelectricity  42  was generated by burning coal and 9  was generated by burning natural gas  The remainder came from other renewable sources such as wind  33  The state s numerous river basins allow hydroelectric power plants to provide 556 thousand MWh  which amounts to about three fourths of Idaho s electricity generated in the state  Washington State provides most of the natural gas used in Idaho through one of the two major pipeline systems supplying the state  Although the state relies on out of state sources for its entire natural gas supply  it uses natural gas fired plants to generate 127 thousand MWh  or about ten percent of its output  Coal fired generation and the state s small array of wind turbines supplies the remainder of the state s electricity output  The state produces 739 thousand MWh but still needs to import half of its electricity from out of state to meet demand  34  While Idaho s 515 trillion Btu total energy consumption is low compared with other states and represents just 0 5  of United States consumption  the state also has the nation s 11th smallest population  1 5 million  so its per capita energy consumption of 352 million Btu is currently just above the national average of 333 million Btu  34  As the 13th largest state in land area  distance creates the additional problem of  line loss   When the length of an electrical transmission line is doubled  the resistance to an electric current passing through it is also doubled  In addition  Idaho also has the 6th fastest growing population in the United States with the population expected to increase by 31  from 2008 to 2030  35  This projected increase in population will contribute to a 42  increase in demand by 2030  further straining Idaho s finite hydroelectric resources  36   edit  Transportation Main article  List of Idaho State Highways The

War  many Midwestern and Southern Democrats moved to the Idaho Territory  As a result  the early territorial legislatures were solidly Democrat controlled  In contrast  most of the territorial governors were appointed by Republican presidents and were Republicans themselves  This led to sometimes bitter clashes between the two parties  including a range war with the Democrats backing the sheepherders and the Republicans the cattlemen  That ended with the  Diamondfield  Jack Davis murder trial  In the 1880s  Republicans became more prominent in local politics  Since statehood  the Republican Party has usually been the dominant party in Idaho  as there was a polar shift in social and political stance between the two parties  when the Democrats became more liberal and the Republicans more conservative  At one time  Idaho had two Democratic parties  one being the mainstream and the other called the Anti Mormon Democrats  lasting into the early 20th century  In the 1890s and early 1900s  the Populist Party enjoyed prominence while the Democratic Party maintained a brief dominance in the 1930s during the Great Depression  Since World War II  most statewide elected officials have been Republicans  The last time the Democratic Party held a majority in either house of the state legislature was the House of Representatives in 1958 by one seat  However  Democrats did hold the governorship from 1971 to 1995  despite the state s Republican tilt  Idaho Congressional delegations have also been generally Republican since statehood  Several Idaho Democrats have had electoral success in the House over the years  but the Senate delegation has been a Republican stronghold for decades  Several Idaho Republicans  including current Senator Mike Crapo  have won reelection to the Senate  but only Frank Church has won reelection as a Democrat  Church was the last Idaho Democrat to win a U S  Senate race  in 1974  Walt Minnick s 2008 win in the First Congressional District was the state s first Democratic Congressional victory in 16 years  In modern times  Idaho has been a reliably Republican state in presidential politics as well  It has not supported a Democrat for president since 1964  Even in that election  Lyndon Johnson defeated Barry Goldwater in the state by fewer than two percentage points  compared to a landslide nationally  In 2004  Republican George W  Bush carried Idaho by a margin of 38 percentage points and with 68 4  of the vote  winning in 43 of 44 counties  Only Blaine County  which contains the Sun Valley ski resort  supported John Kerry  who owns a home in the area  In 2008 Barack Obama s 36 1 percent 39  showing was the best for a Democratic presidential candidate in Idaho since 1976  However  Republican margins were narrower in 1992 and 1996  In the 2006 elections  Republicans  led by gubernatorial candidate C  L   Butch  Otter  won all the state s constitutional offices and retained both of the state s seats in the United States House of Representatives  However  Democrats picked up several seats in the Idaho Legislature  notably in the Boise area  40  Republicans lost one of the House seats in 2008 to Minnick  but Republican Jim Risch retained Larry Craig s Senate seat for the GOP by a comfortable margin  41  Further information  Political party strength in Idaho  edit  Important cities
