of China  and to the south  east  and west by the Republic of India  With an area of 147 181 square kilometres  56 827 sq mi  and a population of approximately 27 million  and 2 million absentee workers living abroad  7   Nepal is the world s 93rd largest country by land mass 8  and the 41st most populous country  Kathmandu is the nation s capital and the country s largest metropolis  Kathmandu Valley itself has estimated population of 5 million  Nepal has a rich geography  The mountainous north has eight of the world s ten tallest mountains  including the highest point on Earth  Mount Everest  called Sagarmatha in Nepali  It contains more than 240 peaks over 20 000 ft  6 096 m  above sea level  9  The fertile and humid south is heavily urbanized  By some measures  Hinduism is practised by a larger majority of people in Nepal than in any other nation  10 Buddhism  though a minority faith in the country  is linked historically with Nepal  Many Nepali do not distinguish between Hinduism and Buddhism and follow both religious traditions  There are three different Buddhist traditions  Himalayan Buddhism  Buddhism of Kathmandu Valley  mostly Mahayana and Vajrayana   and also the Theravada Buddhism  A monarchy throughout most of its history  Nepal was ruled by the Shah dynasty of kings from 1768  when Prithvi Narayan Shah unified its many small kingdoms  However  a decade long Civil War by the Communist Party of Nepal  Maoist  and several weeks of mass protests by all major political parties led to the 12 point agreement of November 22  2005  The ensuing elections for the constituent assembly on May 28  2008 overwhelmingly favored the abdication of the Nepali monarch Gyanendra Shah and the establishment of a federal multiparty representative democratic republic  11  The first President of Nepal  Ram Baran Yadav  was sworn in on July 23  2008  12  Contents 1 Etymology 1 1 Nepal Bhasa origin 1 2 Ne Muni 2 History 2 1 Ancient 2 2 Medieval 2

 Nepal  is believed by scholars to be derived from the word  Nepa   which refers to the Newar Kingdom  the present day Kathmandu Valley  In early Sanskrit sources  Atharvaveda Parisista  and in Gupta period inscriptions  the country is referred to as Nepala  The Newars of present day Nepal  the inhabitants of the Kathmandu Valley and its peripheries  were referred as  Nepa   before the advent of Shah dynasty  Ne Muni Local legends say that a Hindu sage named  Ne  established himself in the valley of Kathmandu in prehistoric times and that the word  Nepal  came into existence as the place protected   pala  in Sanskrit  by the sage  Ne   This folk etymology of the name Nepal means   the country looked after by Ne   13  He is said to have performed religious ceremonies at Teku  at the confluence of the Bagmati and Bishnumati rivers  14  and to have selected a pious cowherd to be the first of the many kings of the Gopala Dynasty  13  These rulers are said to have ruled Nepal for over 500 years  15  He selected Bhuktaman to be the first king in the line of the Gopala  Cowherd  Dynasty  14  The Gopala dynasty is said to have ruled for 621 years  Yakshya Gupta was the last king of this dynasty  However  according to the Skanda Purana  a rishi called  Ne  or  Nemuni  used to live in Himalaya  16  In the Pashupati Purana  he is mentioned as a saint and a protector  17  He is said to have practised meditation at the Bagmati and Kesavati rivers 18  and to have taught there  13  History Main article  History of Nepal Lumbini  the birthplace of Buddha  It appears that Kirata people were one of the first to settle in Nepal  they are said to have ruled Nepal for about 2 500 years  19  Ancient Nepal is first mentioned in the late Vedic text  Atharvaveda Parisista as a place exporting blankets  and in the post Vedic Atharva Siras Upanisad  20  In Samudragupta s Allahabad inscription it is mentioned as a bordering country  The  Skanda Purana  has a separate chapter known as  Nepal Mahatmya   which  explains in more details about the beauty and power of Nepal   21  Nepal is also mentioned in Hindu texts such as the Narayana Puja  20  Around 500 BCE  small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the southern regions of Nepal  From one of these  the Shakya polity  arose a prince named Siddharta Gautama  traditionally dated 563 483 BCE   who later renounced his status to lead an ascetic life and came to be known as the Buddha   the enlightened one    It is believed that the 7th Kirata king  Jitedasti  was on the throne in the Nepal valley at the time  By 250 BCE  the southern regions came under the influence of the Mauryan Empire of northern India  and Nepal later on became a nominal vassal state under the Gupta Empire in the fourth century CE  Beginning in the 3rd century CE  rulers called the Licchavis governed the Kathmandu Valley and surrounding central Nepal  There is a good and quite detailed description of the kingdom of Nepal in the account of the renowned Chinese Buddhist pilgrim monk Xuanzang  dating from c  645 CE  22  23  The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late eighth century  probably due to Tibetan dominance  and was followed by a Newari or Thakuri era  from 879 CE  Nepal Samvat 1   although the extent of their control over the country is uncertain  In the 11th century it seems to have included the Pokhara area  Medieval Former royal palace at Basantapur  Kathmandu In the early 12th century  leaders emerged in far western Nepal whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix malla   wrestler    These kings consolidated their power and ruled over the next 200 years  until the kingdom splintered into two dozen petty states  Another Malla dynasty  beginning with Jayasthiti  emerged in the Kathmandu valley in the late 14th century  and much of central Nepal again came under a unified rule  However  in 1482 the realm was divided into three kingdoms  Kathmandu  Patan  and Bhaktapur  Kingdom of Nepal Main article  Kingdom of Nepal Hindu temples in Patan  capital of one of the three medieval Newar kingdoms After centuries of petty rivalry between the three kingdoms  in the mid 18th century  Prithvi Narayan Shah  a Gorkha King  set out to unify the kingdoms  Seeking arms and aid from India  and buying the neutrality of bordering Indian kingdoms  he embarked on his mission in 1765  After several bloody battles and sieges  he managed to unify the Kathmandu Valley and surrounding territory three years later in 1768  However  an actual battle never took place to conquer the Kathmandu valley  it was taken over by Prithvi Narayan and his troops without any effort  during Indra Jatra  a festival of Newars  when all the valley s citizens were celebrating the festival  This event marked the birth of the modern nation of Nepal  A detailed account of Prithvi Narayan Shah s victory of Lalitpur was written by Father Guillespie in 1795  In 1788 the Nepalese overran Sikkim and sent a punitive raid into Tibet  Kangra in northern India was also occupied by the Nepalese  In 1809  Ranjit Singh the ruler of the Sikh state in the Punjab  had intervened and drove the Nepalese army east of the Satluj river  24  At its maximum extent  Greater Nepal extended from the Tista River in the east  to Kangara  across the Sutlej River in the west as well as further south into the Terai plains and north of the Himalayas than at present  A dispute and subsequent war with Tibet over the control of mountain passes forced the Nepalese to retreat and pay heavy reparations to Tibet  Rivalry between Nepal and the British East India Company over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the Anglo Nepalese War  1815 16   At first the British underestimated the Nepalese and were soundly defeated until committing more military resources than they had anticipated needing  They were greatly impressed by the valour and competence of their adversaries  Thus began the reputation of  Gurkhas  as fierce and ruthless soldiers  The war ended in the Treaty of Sugauli  under which Nepal ceded recently captured portions of Sikkim and lands in Terai as well as the right to recruit soldiers  Factionalism inside the royal family had led to a period of instability  In 1846 a plot was discovered revealing that the reigning queen had planned to overthrow Jung Bahadur Rana  a fast rising military leader  This led to the Kot Massacre  armed clashes between military personnel and administrators loyal to the queen led to the execution of several hundred princes and chieftains around the country  Jung Bahadur Rana emerged victorious and founded the Rana lineage  The king was made a titular figure  and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary  The Ranas were staunchly pro British and assisted them during the Indian Sepoy Rebellion in 1857  and later in both World Wars   Some parts of the Terai Region were given back to Nepal by the British as a friendly gesture  because of her military help to sustain British control in India during the Sepoy Rebellion  In 1923  the United Kingdom and Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship  which superseded the Sugauli Treaty signed in 1816  Nepalese royalty in the 1920s Slavery was abolished in Nepal in 1924  25  Nevertheless debt bondage even involving debtors  children has been a persistent social problem in the Terai  In the late 1940s  newly emerging pro democracy movements and political parties in Nepal were critical of the Rana autocracy  Meanwhile  with the invasion of Tibet by China in the 1950s  India sought to counterbalance the perceived military threat from its northern neighbour by taking pre emptive steps to assert more influence in Nepal  India sponsored both King Tribhuvan  ruled 1911 55  as Nepal s new ruler in 1951 and a new government  mostly comprising the Nepali Congress Party  thus terminating Rana hegemony in the kingdom  After years of power wrangling between the king and the government  King Mahendra  ruled 1955 72  scrapped the democratic experiment in 1959  and a  partyless  panchayat system was made to govern Nepal until 1989  when the  Jan Andolan   People s Movement  forced King Birendra  ruled 1972 2001  to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament that took seat in May 1991  26  In 1991 92  Bhutan expelled roughly 100 000 Bhutanese citizens of Nepali descent  most of whom have been living in seven refugee camps in eastern Nepal ever since  27  In 1996  the Communist Party of Nepal  Maoist  started a bid to replace the royal parliamentary system with a people s socialist republic by violent means  This led to the long Nepal Civil War and more than 12 000 deaths  On 1 June 2001  there was a massacre in the royal palace  King Birendra  Queen Aiswarya  and seven other members of the royal family were killed  The perpetrator was Crown Prince Dipendra  who committed suicide  he died 3 days later  shortly thereafter  This outburst was alleged to have been Dipendra s response to his parents  refusal to accept his choice of wife  Nevertheless there are speculation and doubts among Nepalese citizens about who was responsible  Following the carnage  Birendra s brother Gyanendra inherited the throne  On 1 February 2005  Gyanendra dismissed the entire government and assumed full executive powers to quash the violent Maoist movement  26  but this initiative was unsuccessful because a stalemate had developed where the Maoists were firmly entrenched in large expanses of countryside yet could not dislodge the military from numerous towns and the largest cities  In September 2005  the Maoists declared a three month unilateral ceasefire to negotiate  In response to the 2006 democracy movement King Gyanendra agreed to relinquish sovereign power to the people  On 24 April 2006 the dissolved House of Representatives was reinstated  Using its newly acquired sovereign authority  on 18 May 2006 the House of Representatives unanimously voted to curtail the power of the king and declared Nepal a secular state  ending its time honoured official status as a Hindu Kingdom  On 28 December 2007  a bill was passed in parliament to amend Article 159 of the constitution   replacing  Provisions regarding the King  by  Provisions of the Head of the State    declaring Nepal a federal republic  and thereby abolishing the monarchy  28  The bill came into force on 28 May 2008  29  Republic The Communist Party of Nepal  Maoist  won the largest number of seats in the Constituent Assembly election held on 10 April 2008  and formed a coalition government which included most of the parties in the CA  Although acts of violence occurred during the pre electoral period  election observers noted that the elections themselves were markedly peaceful and  well carried out   30  The newly elected Assembly met in Kathmandu on 28 May 2008  and  after a polling of 564 constituent Assembly members  560 voted to form a new government  29  31  with the monarchist Rastriya Prajatantra Party  which had four members in the assembly  registering a dissenting note  At that point  it was declared that Nepal had become a secular and inclusive democratic republic  32  with the government announcing a three day public holiday from 28 to 30 May  The King was thereafter given 15 days to vacate the Narayanhiti Royal Palace  to re open it as a public museum  Nonetheless  political tensions and consequent power sharing battles have continued in Nepal  In May 2009  the Maoist led government was toppled and another coalition government with all major political parties barring the Maoists was formed  Madhav Kumar Nepal of the Communist Party of Nepal  Unified Marxist Leninist  was made the Prime Minister of the coalition government  Geography Main articles  Geography of Nepal and Geology of Nepal Mount Everest  the highest peak on earth  lies in Nepal NASA Landsat 7 Image of Nepal  Nepal shares most of its boundaries with India  Nepal is of roughly trapezoidal shape  800 kilometres  497 mi  long and 200 kilometres  124 mi  wide  with an area of 147 181 km2  56 827 sq mi   See List of territories by size for the comparative size of Nepal  It lies between latitudes 26  and 31 N  and longitudes 80  and 89 E  Nepal is commonly divided into three physiographic areas  Mountain  Hill and Terai  These ecological belts run east west and are vertically intersected by Nepal s major  north to south flowing river systems  The southern lowland plains or Terai bordering India are part of the northern rim of the Indo Gangetic plains  They were formed and are fed by three major Himalayan rivers  the Kosi  the Narayani  and the Karnali as well as smaller rivers rising below the permanent snowline  This region has a subtropical to tropical climate  The outermost range of foothills called Shiwalik or Churia Range cresting at 700 to 1 000 metres  2 297 to 3 281 ft  marks the limit of the Gangetic Plain  however broad  low valleys called Inner Tarai  Bhitri Tarai Uptyaka  lie north of these foothills in several places  Barun Valley   There are many such valleys in the Himalaya created by glacier flows  Kali Gandaki Gorge  the deepest gorge on earth  The Hill Region  Pahad  abuts the mountains and varies from 800 to 4 000 metres  2 625 to 13 123 ft  in altitude with progression from subtropical climates below 1 200 metres  3 937 ft  to alpine climates above 3 600 metres  11 811 ft   The Mahabharat Range reaching 1 500 to 3 000 metres  4 921 to 9 843 ft  is the southern limit of this region  with subtropical river valleys and  hills  alternating to the north of this range  Population density is high in valleys but notably less above 2 000 metres  6 562 ft  and very low above 2 500 metres  8 202 ft  where snow occasionally falls in winter  The Mountain Region  Parbat   situated in the Great Himalayan Range  makes up the northern part of Nepal  It contains the highest elevations in the world including 8 848 metres  29 029 ft  height Mount Everest  Sagarmatha in Nepali  on the border with China  Seven other of the world s eight thousand metre peaks are in Nepal or on its border with China  Lhotse  Makalu  Cho Oyu  Kanchenjunga  Dhaulagiri  Annapurna and Manaslu  Nepal has five climatic zones  broadly corresponding to the altitudes  The tropical and subtropical zones lie below 1 200 metres  3 937 ft   the temperate zone 1 200 to 2 400 metres  3 937 to 7 874 ft   the cold zone 2 400 to 3 600 metres  7 874 to 11 811 ft   the subarctic zone 3 600 to 4 400 metres  11 811 to 14 436 ft   and the Arctic zone above 4 400 metres  14 436 ft   Nepal experiences five seasons  summer  monsoon  autumn  winter and spring  The Himalaya blocks cold winds from Central Asia in the winter and forms the northern limit of the monsoon wind patterns  In a land once thickly forested  deforestation is a major problem in all regions  with resulting erosion and degradation of ecosystems  Nepal is popular for mountaineering  containing some of the highest and most challenging mountains in the world  including Mount Everest  Technically  the south east ridge on the Nepali side of the mountain is easier to climb  so  most climbers prefer to trek to Everest through Nepal  Neotectonics The collision between the Indian subcontinent and the Eurasian continent  which started in Paleogene time and continues today  produced the Himalaya and the Tibetan Plateau  a spectacular modern example of the effects of plate tectonics  Nepal lies completely within this collision zone  occupying the central sector of the Himalayan arc  nearly one third of the 2 400 km  1 500 mi  long Himalayas  33  34  35  36  37  38  The Indian plate continues to move north relative to Asia at the rate of approximately 50 mm  2 0 in  per year  39  Given the great magnitudes of the blocks of the Earth s crust involved  this is remarkably fast  about twice the speed at which human fingernails grow  As the strong Indian continental crust subducts beneath the relatively weak Tibetan crust  it pushes up the Himalayan mountains  This collision zone has accommodated huge amounts of crustal shortening as the rock sequences slide one over another  As such Nepal is prone to frequent earthquakes  a major earthquake happening within every 100 years  40  Erosion of the Himalayas is a very important source of sediment  which flows via several great rivers  the Indus to the Indian Ocean  and the Ganges and Brahmaputra river system  to the Bay of Bengal  41  Environment The dramatic differences in elevation found in Nepal result in a variety of biomes  from tropical savannas along the Indian border  to subtropical broadleaf and coniferous forests in the Hill Region  to temperate broadleaf and coniferous forests on the slopes of the Himalaya  to montane grasslands and shrublands and rock and ice at the highest elevations  At the lowest elevations is the Terai Duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion  These form a mosaic with the Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests  which occur from 500 to 1 000 metres  1 600 to 3 300 ft  and include the Inner Terai Valleys  Himalayan subtropical pine forests occur between 1 000 and 2 000 metres  3 300 and 6 600 ft   Above these elevations  the biogeography of Nepal is generally divided from east to west by the Gandaki River  Ecoregions to the east tend to receive more precipitation and to be more species rich  Those to the west are drier with fewer species  From 1 500 to 3 000 metres  4 900 to 9 800 ft   are temperate broadleaf forests  the eastern and western Himalayan broadleaf forests  From 3 000 to 4 000 metres  9 800 to 13 000 ft  are the eastern and western Himalayan subalpine conifer forests  To 5 500 metres  18 000 ft  are the eastern and western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows  Subdivisions Main articles  Regions of Nepal  Zones of Nepal  and Districts of Nepal Subdivisions of Nepal Nepal is divided into 14 zones and 75 districts  grouped into five development regions  Each district is headed by a permanent chief district officer responsible for maintaining law and order and coordinating the work of field agencies of the various government ministries  The five regions and 14 zones are  Eastern Region  Purwanchal  Koshi Mechi Sagarmatha Central Region  Madhyamanchal

Seti Government and politics Main article  Politics of Nepal Singha Durbar  the seat of Nepalese government Nepal has seen rapid political changes during the last two decades  Up until 1990  Nepal was a monarchy under executive control of the King  Faced with a communist movement against absolute monarchy  King Birendra  in 1990  agreed to a large scale political reform by creating a parliamentary monarchy with the King as the head of state and a Prime Minister as the head of the government  Nepal s legislature was bicameral  consisting of a House of Representatives called the Pratinidhi Sabha and a National Council called the Rastriya Sabha  The House of Representatives consisted of 205 members directly elected by the people  The National Council had 60 members  ten nominated by the king  35 elected by the House of Representatives  and the remaining 15 elected by an electoral college made up of chairs of villages and towns  The legislature had a five year term but was dissolvable by the king before its term could end  All Nepali citizens 18 years and older became eligible to vote  The executive comprised the King and the Council of Ministers  the cabinet   The leader of the coalition or party securing the maximum seats in an election was appointed as the Prime Minister  The Cabinet was appointed by the king on the recommendation of the Prime Minister  Governments in Nepal tended to be highly unstable  falling either through internal collapse or parliamentary dissolution by the monarch  on the recommendation of the prime minister  according to the constitution  no government has survived for more than two years since 1991  The movement in April 2006 brought about a change in the nation s governance  an interim constitution was promulgated  with the King giving up power  and an interim House of Representatives was formed with Maoist members after the new government held peace talks with the Maoist rebels  The number of parliamentary seats was also increased to 330  In April 2007  the Communist Party of Nepal  Maoist  joined the interim government of Nepal  In December 2007  the interim parliament passed a bill making Nepal a federal republic  with a president as head of state  Elections for the constitutional assembly were held on 10 April 2008  the Maoist party led the results but did not achieve a simple majority of seats  42  The new parliament adopted the 2007 bill at its first meeting by an overwhelming majority  and King Gyanendra was given 15 days to leave the Royal Palace in central Kathmandu  He left on 11 June  43  On 26 June  the prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala  who had served as Acting Head of State since January 2007  announced that he would resign on the election of the country s first president by the Constituent Assembly  The first round of voting  on 19 July  saw Parmanand Jha win election as Nepali vice president  but neither of the contenders for president received the required 298 votes and a second round was held two days later  Ram Baran Yadav of the Nepali Congress party defeated Maoist backed Ram Raja Prasad Singh with 308 of the 590 votes cast  44  Koirala submitted his resignation to the new president after Yadav s swearing in ceremony on 23 July  On 15 August 2008  Maoist leader Prachanda  Pushpa Kamal Dahal  was elected Prime Minister of Nepal  the first since the country s transition from a monarchy to a republic  On 4 May 2009  Dahal resigned over on going conflicts with regard to the sacking of the Army chief  Since Dahal s resignation  the country has been in a serious political deadlock with one of the big issues being the proposed integration of the former Maoist combatants  also known as the People s Liberation Army  into the national security forces  45  After Dahal  Jhala Nath Khanal of CPN  UML  was elected the Prime Minister  Khanal was forced to step down as he could not succeed in carrying forward the Peace Process and the constitution writing  On August 2011  Maoist Dr  Babu Ram Bhattarai became third Prime Minister after the election of constituent assembly  46  Nepal has also been noted for its recent speed of development  such as being one of the few countries in Asia to abolish the death penalty 47  and the first country in Asia to rule in favor of same sex marriage  which the government has a seven person committee studying after a November 2008 ruling by the nation s Supreme Court  which ordered full rights for LGBT individuals  including the right to marry  48  Military and foreign affairs Main articles  Nepalese Armed

standing treaty  Indian and Nepalese citizens may travel to each others  countries without a passport or visa  Nepalese citizens may work in India without legal restriction  However  since the Government of Nepal has been dominated by Socialists and India s by more right wing parties  India has been remilitarizing the  porous  Indo Nepali border  in order to stifle the flow of Islamist groups  51  Nepal established relations with the People s Republic of China on August 1  1955  and relations since have been based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence  Nepal has aided China in the aftermath of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake  and China has provided economic assistance for Nepali infrastructure  Both countries have cooperated to host the 2008 Summer Olympics summit of Mt

Tourism Year 2011 Main article  Nepal Tourism Year 2011 The country is currently celebrating Nepal Tourism Year 2011 after an official launch by the nation s President  Dr Ram Baran Yadav  at the Dasarath stadium in the capital amidst a grand celebration on 14 January 2011  Infrastructure Nepal remains isolated from the world s major land  air and sea transport routes although  within the country  aviation is in a better state  with 48 airports  ten of them with paved runways  flights are frequent and support a sizable traffic  The hilly and mountainous terrain in the northern two thirds of the country has made the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive  There were just over 8 500 km  5 282 mi  of paved roads  and one 59 km railway line in the south in 2003  There is only one reliable road route from India to the Kathmandu Valley  The only practical seaport of entry for goods bound for Kathmandu is Calcutta in India  Internally  the poor state of development of the road system  22 of 75 administrative districts lack road links  makes volume distribution unrealistic  Besides having landlocked  rugged geography  few tangible natural resources and poor infrastructure  the long running civil war is also a factor in stunting the economic growth  58  There is less than one telephone per 19 people  Landline telephone services are not adequate nationwide but are concentrated in cities and district headquarters  Mobile telephony is in a reasonable state in most parts of the country with increased accessibility and affordability  there were around 175 000 Internet connections in 2005  After the imposition of the  state of emergency   intermittent losses of service signals were reported  but uninterrupted Internet connections have resumed

though Indo Nepalese migrants were latecomers to Nepal relative to the migrants from the north  they have come to dominate the country not only numerically  but also socially  politically  and economically  60  Among the earliest inhabitants were the Kirat of east mid region  Newar of the Kathmandu Valley and aboriginal Tharu in the southern Terai region  The ancestors of the Brahmin and Chetri caste groups came from India s present Kumaon  Garhwal and Kashmir regions  while other ethnic groups trace their origins to North Burma and Yunnan and Tibet  e g  the Gurung and Magar in the

Buddhism exist in Nepal and the Newa people have their own branch of the faith  Buddhism is also the dominant religion of the thinly populated northern areas  which are mostly inhabited by Tibetan related peoples  such as the Sherpa  The Buddha  born as a Hindu  is also said to be a descendant of Vedic Sage Angirasa in many Buddhist texts  65  The Buddha s family surname is associated with Gautama Maharishi  66  Differences between Hindus and Buddhists have been minimal in Nepal due to the cultural and historical intermingling of Hindu and Buddhist beliefs  Morever traditionally Buddhism and Hinduism were never two distinct religions in the western sense of the word  In Nepal  the faiths share common temples and worship common deities  Among other natives of Nepal  those more influenced by Hinduism were the Magar  Sunwar  Limbu and Rai and the Gurkhas  19  Hindu influence is less prominent among the Gurung  Bhutia  and Thakali groups who employ Buddhist monks for their religious ceremonies  19  57  Most of the festivals in Nepal are Hindu  67  The Machendrajatra festival  dedicated to Hindu Shaiva Siddha  is celebrated by many Buddhists in Nepal as a main festival
