Sokolow had adopted the name of a Mesopotamian site in Ezekiel 3 15   Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv  that lived by the river Chebar  and to where they lived  and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days    23  The name was chosen in 1910 from several suggestions  including  Herzliya   It was found fitting as it embraced the idea of a renaissance in the ancient Jewish homeland  Aviv is Hebrew for  spring   symbolizing renewal  and tel is a man made mound accumulating layers of civilization built one over the other and symbolizing the ancient  24  Theories vary about the etymology of Jaffa or Yafo in Hebrew  Some believe that the name derives from yafah or yofi  Hebrew for  beautiful  or  beauty   Another tradition is that Japheth  son of Noah  founded the city and that it was named after him   edit  History  edit  Jaffa Port of Jaffa in 1906 Lottery for building plots in Tel Aviv  1909 The ancient port of Jaffa changed hands many times in the course of history  Archeological excavations from 1955 to 1974 unearthed towers and gates from the Middle Bronze Age  25  Subsequent excavations  from 1997 onwards  helped date earlier discoveries  25  They also exposed sections of a packed sandstone glacis and a  massive brick wall   dating from the Late Bronze Age as well as a temple  attributed to the Sea Peoples  and dwellings from the Iron Age  25  Remnants of buildings from the Persian and Hellenistic periods were also discovered  25  The city is first mentioned in letters from 1470 BCE that record its conquest by Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III  8  Jaffa is mentioned several times in the Bible  as the port from which Jonah set sail for Tarshish  26  as bordering on the territory of the Tribe of Dan  27  and as the Jaffa Port at which the wood for Solomon s Temple in Jerusalem arrived from Lebanon  28  According to some sources it has been a port for at least 4 000 years  29  In 1099  the Christian armies of the First Crusade  led by Godfrey of Bouillon occupied Jaffa  which had been abandoned by the Muslims  fortified the town and improved its harbor  30  As the County of Jaffa  the town soon became important as the main sea supply route for the Kingdom of Jerusalem  31  Jaffa was captured by Saladin in 1192 but swiftly re taken by Richard Coeur de Lion  who added to its defenses  32  In 1223  Emperor Frederick II added further fortications  32  Crusader domination ended in 1268  when the Mamluk Sultan Baibars captured the town  destroyed its harbor and razed its fortifications  32  33  In 1336  when a new Crusade was being planned  Al Nasir Muhammad had the harbor destroyed to prevent the Franks from landing there  34  For the same reason  both the town and the harbor were destroyed in 1345  34  In the 16th century  Jaffa was conquered by the Ottomans and was administered as a village in the Sanjak of Gaza  33  Napoleon besieged the city in 1799 and killed scores of inhabitants  a plague epidemic followed  decimating the remaining population  33  The surrendering garrison of several thousand Muslims was massacred  35  Builder in Tel Aviv  1920s Jaffa began to grow as an urban center in the early 18th century  when the Ottoman government in Istanbul intervened to guard the port and reduce attacks by Bedouins and pirates  33  However  the real expansion came during the 19th century  when the population grew from 2 500 in 1806 to 17 000 in 1886  8  From 1800 to 1870  Jaffa was surrounded by walls and towers  which were torn down to allow for expansion as security improved  36  The sea wall  2 5 metres  8 2 ft  high  remained intact until the 1930s  when it was built over during a renovation of the port by the British Mandatory authorities  36  During the mid 19th century  the city grew prosperous from trade  especially in silk and Jaffa oranges  with Europe  8  In the 1860s Jaffa s small Sephardic community was joined by Jews from Morocco and small numbers of European Ashkenazi Jews  making by 1882 a total Jewish population of more than 1 500  8  The first Jews to build outside of Jaffa  in the area of modern day Tel Aviv  were Yemenite Jews  These homes  built in 1881  became the core of Kerem HaTeimanim  Hebrew for  the Vineyard of the Yemenites    In 1896 the Yemenite Jews established Mahane Yehuda  and in 1904  Mahane Yossef  These neighbourhoods later became the Shabazi neighbourhood  During the 1880s  Ashkenazi immigration to Jaffa increased with the onset of the First Aliyah  The new arrivals were motivated more by Zionism than religion and came to farm the land and engage in productive labor  8  In keeping with their pioneer ideology  some chose to settle in the sand dunes north of Jaffa  8  The beginning of modern day Tel Aviv is marked by the construction of Neve Tzedek  a neighborhood built by Ashkenazi settlers between 1887 and 1896  6   edit  Ahuzat Bayit The Pagoda House  built in 1924  is an Eclectic Style landmark The Second Aliyah led to further expansion  8  In 1906  a group of Jews  among them residents of Jaffa  followed the initiative of Akiva Arye Weiss and banded together to form the Ahuzat Bayit  lit   homestead   society  The society s goal was to form a  Hebrew urban centre in a healthy environment  planned according to the rules of aesthetics and modern hygiene   8  The urban planning for the new city was influenced by the ideas of the Garden city movement  37  In 1908  the group purchased 5 hectares  12 acres  of dunes northeast of Jaffa  citation needed  Following this purchase  Meir Dizengoff  who later became Tel Aviv s first mayor  decided to join Ahuzat Bayit  38  39  His vision for Tel Aviv involved peaceful co existence with the Arabs  8  Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium in 1936 In April 1909  66 Jewish families gathered on a desolate sand dune on what is now Rothschild Boulevard to parcel out the land by lottery using seashells  This gathering is considered the official date of the establishment of Tel Aviv  although some neighbourhoods  such as Kerem HaTeimanim  already existed  The lottery was organised by Akiva Arye Weiss  president of the building society  The names of the families were inscribed on white shells and the plot number on shells of a different color  40  Within a year  Herzl  Ahad Ha am  Yehuda Halevi  Lilienblum  and Rothschild streets were built  a water system was installed  and 66 houses  including some on six subdivided plots  were completed  37  At the end of Herzl Street  a plot was allocated for a new building for the Herzliya Hebrew High School  founded in Jaffa in 1906  37  On 21 May 1910  the name Tel Aviv was adopted  37  Tel Aviv was planned as an independent Hebrew city with wide streets and boulevards  running water at each house and street lights  41  By 1914  Tel Aviv had grown to more than 1 square kilometre  247 acres   37  However  growth halted in 1917 when the Ottoman authorities expelled the Jews of Jaffa and Tel Aviv  37  A report published in The New York Times by United States Consul Garrels in Alexandria  Egypt described the Jaffa deportation of early April 1917  The orders of evacuation were aimed chiefly at the Jewish population  42   edit  Under the British Mandate Immanuel Church                part of the American Germany Colony  Tel Aviv Jaffo Under British administration  political friction between Jews and Arabs in Palestine increased  On 1 May 1921  the Jaffa Riots erupted resulting in the deaths of 48 Arabs and 47 Jews and injuries to 146 Jews and 73 Arabs  43  In the wake of this violence  many Jews left Jaffa for Tel Aviv  increasing the population of Tel Aviv from 2 000 in 1920 to around 34 000 by 1925  6  44  New businesses opened in Tel Aviv  leading to the decline of Jaffa as a commercial center  37  In 1925  the Scottish biologist  sociologist  philanthropist and pioneering town planner Patrick Geddes drew up a master plan for Tel Aviv that was adopted by the city council led by Meir Dizengoff  This first plan for developing the northern part of the city was called  The Geddes Plan   8  The core idea was the development of a Garden City  The boundaries he worked within  the Yarkon River in the North and Ibn Gvirol Street in the East  are now the boundaries of Tel Aviv s Old North  Tel Aviv continued to expand in 1926  but suffered an economic setback between 1927 and 1930  8  37  The Ben Gurion House was built in 1930 31  part of a new worker s housing development  At the same time  cultural life was given a boost by the establishment of the Ohel Theater and the decision of Habima Theatre to make Tel Aviv its permanent base in 1931  37  The Tel Aviv Port was opened on February 23  1938  and closed on October 25  1965  Tel Aviv gained municipal status in 1934  37  The population rose dramatically during the Fifth Aliyah when the Nazis came to power in Germany  37  As the Jews fled Europe  many settled in Tel Aviv  bringing the population in 1937 to 150 000  compared to Jaffa s 69 000 residents  Within two years  it had reached 160 000  which was over a third of the country s total Jewish population  37  Many new immigrants remained after disembarking in Jaffa  turning the city into a center of urban life  In the wake of the 1936 39 Arab revolt  a local port independent of Jaffa was built in 1938  and Lydda Airport  later Ben Gurion Airport  and Sde Dov Airport opened between 1937 and 1938  8  Tel Aviv s White City  a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2003  emerged in the 1930s  Many of the German Jewish architects trained at the Bauhaus  the Modernist school of architecture closed by the Nazis in 1933  fled Germany  Some  like architect Arieh Sharon  came to Palestine and adapted the architectural outlook of the Bauhaus as well as other similar schools  to local conditions  creating what is claimed to be the largest concentration of buildings in the International Style in the world  6  8  Bauhaus  left  and Eclectic

1947 UN Partition Plan for dividing Palestine into Jewish and Arab states  Tel Aviv  by then a city of 230 000  was slated for inclusion in the Jewish state  Jaffa with  as of 1945  a population of 101 580 people  53 930 of whom were Muslim and 16 800 Christian  making up the Arab population  and 30 820 Jewish  was designated as part of the Arab state  46  The Arabs  however  rejected the plan  8  Between 1947 and 1948  tensions grew on the border between Tel Aviv and Jaffa  with Arab snipers who were firing at Jews from the minaret of the Hassan Bek Mosque  The Haganah and Irgun Jewish forces retaliated with a siege on Jaffa  8  From April 1948  the Arab residents began to leave  When Jaffa was conquered by Israeli forces on 14 May  few remained  8   edit  After Israeli independence Crowd outside Dizengoff House  now Independence Hall  to hear declaration and signing of Israel s Declaration of Independence in 1948 When Israel declared Independence on 14 May 1948  the population of Tel Aviv was over 200 000  2  Tel Aviv was the temporary government center of the State of Israel until the government moved to Jerusalem in December 1949  Due to the international dispute over the status of Jerusalem  most foreign embassies remained in or near Tel Aviv  24  In the early 1980s  13 embassies in Jerusalem moved to Tel Aviv as part of the UN s measures responding to Israel s 1980 Jerusalem Law  47  Today  all national embassies are in Tel Aviv or environs  48  The boundaries of Tel Aviv and Jaffa became a matter of contention between the Tel Aviv municipality and the Israeli government in 1948  49  The former wished to incorporate only the northern Jewish suburbs of Jaffa  while the latter wanted a more complete unification  49  The issue also had international sensitivity  since the main part of Jaffa was in the Arab portion of the United Nations Partition Plan  whereas Tel Aviv was not  and no armistice agreements had yet been signed  49  On 10 December 1948  the government announced the annexation to Tel Aviv of Jaffa s Jewish suburbs  the ex Arab neighborhood of Abu Kabir  the ex Arab village of Salama and some of its agricultural land  and the Jewish  Hatikva  slum  49  On 25 February 1949  the abandoned Arab village of al Shaykh Muwannis was also annexed to Tel Aviv  49  On 18 May 1949  Manshiya and part of Jaffa s central zone were added  for the first time including land that had been in the Arab portion of the UN partition plan  49  The government voted on the unification of Tel Aviv and Jaffa on 4 October 1949  but the decision was not implemented until 24 April 1950 due to the opposition of Tel Aviv mayor Israel Rokach  49  The name of the unified city was Tel Aviv until 19 August 1950  when it was renamed Tel Aviv Yafo in order to preserve the historical name Jaffa  49  Tel Aviv thus grew to 42 square kilometers  16 2 sq mi   In 1949  a memorial to the 60 founders of Tel Aviv was constructed  50  Over the past 60 years  Tel Aviv has developed into a secular  liberal minded center with a vibrant nightlife and caf  culture  8  In the 1960s  some of the older buildings were demolished  making way for the country s first high rises  Shalom Meir Tower was Israel s tallest building until 1999  Tel Aviv s population peaked in the early 1960s at 390 000  representing 16 percent of the country s total  51  A long period of steady decline followed  however  and by the late 1980s the city had an aging population of 317 000  51  High property prices pushed families out and deterred young people from moving in  51  At this time  gentrification began in the poor neighborhoods of southern Tel Aviv  and the old port in the north was renewed  8  New laws were introduced to protect Modernist buildings  and efforts to preserve them were aided by UNESCO recognition of the Tel Aviv s White City as a world heritage site  In the early 1990s  the decline in population was reversed  partly due to the large wave of immigrants from the former Soviet Union  51  Tel Aviv also began to emerge as a high tech center  8  The construction of many skyscrapers and high tech office buildings followed  In 1993  Tel Aviv was categorized as a world city  52  The city is regarded as a strong candidate for global city status  14  A Bauhaus street cafe in Florentin  Tel Aviv  In the Gulf War in 1991  Tel Aviv was attacked by Scud rockets from Iraq  but there were few casualties and no fatalities  The inhabitants of the southeastern suburb of HaTikva erected an angel monument as a sign of their gratitude  that  it was through a great miracle  that many people were preserved from being killed by a direct hit of a Scud rocket   53  On 4 November 1995  Israel s prime minister  Yitzhak Rabin  was assassinated at a rally in Tel Aviv in support of the Oslo peace accord  The outdoor plaza where this occurred  formerly known as Kikar Malchei Yisrael  was renamed Rabin Square  8  Since the First Intifada  Tel Aviv has suffered from Palestinian political violence  The first suicide attack in Tel Aviv occurred on 19 October 1994  on the Line 5 bus  when a bomber killed himself and 21 civilians as part of a Hamas suicide campaign  The most deadly attack occurred on 1 June 2001  during the Second Intifada  when a suicide bomber exploded at the entrance to the Dolphinarium discotheque  killing 21 and injuring more than 100  The most recent attack in the city occurred on 17 April 2006  when nine people were killed and at least 40 wounded in a suicide bombing near the old central bus station  54  In 2009  Tel Aviv celebrated its official centennial  55  In addition to city  and country wide celebrations  digital collections of historical materials were assembled  These include the History section of

dunes and as such has relatively poor soil fertility  The land has been flattened and has no important gradients  its most notable geographical features are bluffs above the Mediterranean coastline and the Yarkon River mouth  58  Because of the expansion of Tel Aviv and the Gush Dan region  absolute borders between Tel Aviv and Jaffa and between the city s neighborhoods do not exist  The city is
