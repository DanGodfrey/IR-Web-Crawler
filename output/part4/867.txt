Stadium  usually shortened to Shea Stadium or just Shea      e     was a stadium in the New York City borough of Queens  in Flushing Meadows Corona Park  6  It was the home baseball park of Major League Baseball s New York Mets from 1964 to 2008  Originally built as a multi purpose stadium  Shea was also the home of the New York Jets football team from 1964 to 1983  It was named in honor of William A  Shea  the man who brought National League baseball back to New York  It was demolished in 2009 to furnish additional parking for the adjacent Citi Field  the current home of the Mets

Shea Stadium go back to the controversial west coast relocation of the Dodgers and the Giants which left New York without a National League presence  New York City official Robert Moses tried to interest Brooklyn Dodgers owner Walter O Malley in this site as the location for a new Dodger stadium  but O Malley refused  unable to agree on location  ownership and lease terms  O Malley preferred to pay construction costs himself so he would own the stadium outright  He wanted total control over revenue from parking  concessions  and other events  The City  by contrast  wanted to build the stadium  rent it  and retain these ancillary revenue rights to pay off its construction bonds  7  Additionally  O Malley wanted to build his new stadium in Brooklyn  while Moses insisted on Flushing Meadows  When Los Angeles offered O Malley what the City of New York wouldn t complete and absolute ownership of the facility he left for southern California in a preemptive bid to install the Dodgers there before a new or existing major league franchise could beat him to it  At the same time  Horace Stoneham moved his New York Giants to the San Francisco Bay Area  ensuring that there would be two west coast NL teams and preserving the longstanding rivalry with O Malley s Dodgers that continues to this day  In 1960  the National League agreed to grant an expansion franchise to the owners of the New York franchise in the abortive Continental League  provided that a new stadium be built  Mayor Robert Wagner  Jr  had to personally wire all National League owners and assure them that the city would build a park  On October 6  1961  the Mets signed a 30 year stadium lease  with an option for a 10 year renewal  Rent for what was originally budgeted as a  9 million facility was set at  450 000 annually  with a reduction of  20 000 each year until it reaches  300 000 annually  The Mets  inaugural season  1962  was played in the Polo Grounds  with original plans calling for the team to move to a new stadium in 1963  In October 1962  Mets official Tom Meany said   Only a series of blizzards or some other unforeseen trouble might hamper construction   That unforeseen trouble surfaced in a number of ways  the severe winter of 1962 1963  along with the bankruptcies of two subcontractors and labor issues  The end result was that both the Mets and Jets played at the Polo Grounds for one more year  A game at Shea during the 1964 season It was originally to be called  Flushing Meadow Park Municipal Stadium  8    the name of the public park on which it was built   but a movement was launched to name it in honor of William A  Shea  the man who brought National League baseball back to New York   edit  Opening After 29 months and  28 5 million  Shea Stadium opened on April 17  1964  with the Pittsburgh Pirates beating the Mets 4 3 before a crowd of 50 312  9   edit  Demolition Shea Stadium logo  commemorating the stadium s final year In accordance with New York City law  Shea Stadium was dismantled  rather than imploded  10  The company with the rights to sell memorabilia was given two weeks after the final game to remove seats  signage and other potentially saleable collectable items before demolition was to begin  The seats were the first   869 per pair plus tax  a combination of  86 and  69   11  followed by other Shea memorabilia such as the foul poles  dugouts  stadium signage  and the giant letters that spell out  SHEA  at the front of the building  Demolition in progress  Top photo  close up view of the stadium during demolition  Bottom photo  demolition as viewed from the IRT Flushing Line  After salvaging operations concluded  actual demolition of the ballpark began on October 14  2008  On October 18  the scoreboard in right field was demolished  with the bleachers  batter s eye and bullpens soon to follow  12  By November 10  the field  dugouts and the rest of the field level seats had been demolished  13  By mid December  all of the Loge level seats and a good portion of the Mezzanine level seating were gone as well  leaving only the outer shell remaining  Plaque commemorating the location of Shea Stadium s home plate  now in Citi Field s parking lot  Demolition work on the upper deck began by January 1  2009  The next day  all that remained of sections 26 48 of the upper deck was the steel framework  By January 8  the steel framework for sections 36 48 of the upper deck had been completely removed  all that remained of the  Live  amp  In Person  advertising banner at the top above Gate A was the extreme right portion with the Shea Stadium Final Season logo  As of January 15  the far left field portion of Shea was completely demolished and the left field upper deck  sections 25 47  was stripped to its steel framework  The remaining letters at the top of the ballpark behind home plate were taken down on January 21  Approximately two thirds of the stadium s outer superstructure was gone by January 24  On January 31  Mets fans all over New York came to Shea for one final farewell to Shea Stadium  Fans took a tour of the site  told stories  and sang songs  14  The last remaining section of seats was demolished on February 18  Fans stood in awe as the remaining structure of Shea Stadium  one section of ramps  was torn down at 11 22 AM that morning  15  16  Shea s home plate  pitcher s mound  and the bases are immortalized in Citi Field s parking lot  and feature engravings of the neon baseball players that once graced the exterior of the stadium  17   edit  Stadium usage  edit  Sports  edit  Baseball Shea Stadium prior to a game in September 1969  Shea Stadium was the home of the New York Mets since its inception in 1964  and hosted the Major League Baseball All Star Game that same year  with Johnny Callison of the Philadelphia Phillies hitting a home run in the ninth inning to win the only Mid Summer Classic held in the Queens ballpark  A month earlier on Father s Day  Callison s teammate  future Hall of Fame member and United States Senator Jim Bunning  pitched a perfect game against the Mets  18  The stadium was often criticized by baseball purists for many reasons  even though it was retrofitted to be a baseball only stadium after the Jets left  The upper deck was one of the highest in the majors  The lower boxes were farther from the field than similar seats in other parks because they were still on the rails that swiveled the boxes into position for football  19  Outfield seating was always rather sparse  in part because the stadium was intended to be fully enclosed  At one time  Shea s foul territory was one of the most expansive in the majors  which was typical for ballparks that were built during this era  19  However  seats added over the years in the lower level greatly reduced the size of foul territory by the dawn of the 21st century  Also on the plus side  Shea always used a natural grass surface  This stood in contrast to multi purpose stadiums such as Three Rivers Stadium and Riverfront Stadium  which were built in the same era and style and used artificial turf instead of natural grass  Shea Stadium hosted postseason baseball in 1969  1973  1986  1988  1999  2000 and 2006  it hosted the World Series in 1969  1973  1986  and 2000  Shea Stadium had the distinction of being the home of the 1969  Miracle Mets     a team led by former Brooklyn Dodger Gil Hodges that defied 100 1 odds and won the World Series  this after recording seven straight seasons in last or next to last place  Shea became famous for the bedlam that took place after the Mets won the decisive Game 5 of the 1969 World Series  as fans stormed the field in celebration  A similar scene took place a few weeks earlier after the Mets defeated the Atlanta Braves in the first National League Championship Series to win the pennant  Tommie Agee  Lenny Dykstra  Todd Pratt  Robin Ventura  and Benny Agbayani have all hit post season  game winning home runs at Shea  Tommie Agee was the only player in the history of the ballpark to hit a home run into the upper deck in left field  The spot was marked with a sign featuring Agee s number  and the date of the event  April 10  1969  Teammate Cleon Jones says the ball was still rising when it hit the seats  so it very likely could have been the longest home run ever hit at Shea Stadium  citation needed  In 1971  Dave Kingman   then with the San Francisco Giants  later to play for the Mets on two occasions   hit a home run that smashed off the windshield of the Giants  team bus  parked behind the left field bullpen  For many years  the Mets  theme song   Meet the Mets   was played at Shea before every home game  Jane Jarvis  a local jazz artist  played the popular songs on the Thomas organ at Mets games for many years at the stadium  20  On October 3  2004  the stadium was the venue of the last game in the history of the Montreal Expos when the Mets defeated the Expos 8 1  21  Their story ended where it had started 35 years earlier  at Shea Stadium  22  The following year  the Expos relocated to Washington  D C   where they were renamed the Nationals  As of June 10  2005  the Mets had played more games at Shea Stadium than the Brooklyn Dodgers did at Ebbets Field  citation needed  The last game played at Shea Stadium was a loss to the Florida Marlins on September 28  2008  However  the Mets were in the thick of the playoff chase until the last day  A win would have meant another game for Shea as the Mets were scheduled to play the Milwaukee Brewers in a one game playoff for the NL Wild Card had they won  Following the game  there was a  Shea Goodbye  tribute in which many players from the Mets glory years entered the stadium and touched home plate one final time so that fans could pay their last respects to the players and the stadium the Mets called home for 45 years  The ceremony ended with Tom Seaver throwing a final pitch to Mike Piazza  then  as the Beatles  In My Life  played on the stadium speakers the two former Met stars walked out of the centerfield gate and closed it behind them  followed by a display of blue and orange fireworks  23  24  A baseball game at Shea Stadium Three National League Division Series were played at Shea Stadium  The Mets won all three  and never lost a Division Series game at Shea  1999 against the Arizona Diamondbacks   Mets win 3 games to 1 2000 against the San Francisco Giants   Mets win 3 games to 1 2006 against the Los Angeles Dodgers   Mets win 3 games to 0 Seven National League Championship Series were played at

Cardinals   Cardinals win 4 games to 3    The decisive seventh game of this series was played at Shea Stadium  marking the only time that the Mets ever lost the deciding game of an NLCS at home  Four World Series were played in Shea Stadium  1969 against the Baltimore Orioles   Mets win 4 games to 1 1973 against the Oakland Athletics   A s win 4 games to 3 1986 against the Boston Red Sox   Mets win 4 games to 3 2000 against the New York Yankees   Yankees win 4 games to 1 The Yankees World Series win in 2000 was the only time that visiting teams won a World Series at Shea Stadium  The Mets won both their World Series titles at Shea Stadium  in Game 5 in 1969  and Game 7 in 1986   Shea Stadium prior to the start of a New York Mets game in 2008  Shea had the best attendance in the National League that year  garnering over 53 000 fans per game on average  The New York Yankees played their home games in Shea Stadium during the 1974 and 1975 seasons while Yankee Stadium was being renovated  The move to Shea had been proposed earlier in the decade  but the Mets  as Shea s primary tenants  refused to sign off on the deal  However  when the city stepped in to pay for renovating Yankee Stadium  the Mets had little choice but to agree to share Shea with the Yankees  Separately  on the afternoon of April 15  1998  the Yankees also played one home game at Shea  against the Anaheim Angels after a beam collapsed at Yankee Stadium two days before  destroying several rows of seats  25  26  With the Mets playing a game at Shea that evening against the Chicago Cubs  the Yankees used the visitor s locker room and dugout and the Angels used the home dugout and old locker room of the New York Jets  27  Former Mets star Darryl Strawberry  then playing for the Yankees  hit a home run during the game  Stadium operators partially raised the Mets  home run apple signal before lowering it back down  much to the delight of the crowd present  28  Shea Stadium also hosted the first extra inning regular season baseball opener ever played in New York  on March 31  1998  29  when the Mets opened their season against their rival Philadelphia Phillies  playing the longest scoreless opening day game in the National League and the longest one in the MLB since 1926  30  31  The Mets won the game 1 0 in the bottom of the 14th  31  During the 1977 New York City blackout the stadium was plunged into darkness at approximately 9 30 p m  during a game between the Mets and the Chicago Cubs  It occurred during the bottom of the sixth inning  with the Mets losing 2 1 and Lenny Randle at bat  Jane Jarvis  Shea s organist  affectionately known as Shea s  Queen of Melody   played  Jingle Bells  and  White Christmas   32  The game was eventually completed on September 16  with the Cubs winning 5 2  33   edit  Football A concept drawing of Shea Stadium in football configuration The New York Jets of the American Football League and later  the National Football League played at Shea for twenty seasons  from 1964 to 1983  excluding their first home game in 1977 played at Giants Stadium   The stadium hosted three Jets playoff games  the American Football League Championship in 1968  beat the Oakland Raiders  27 23   an AFL Divisional Playoff in 1969  lost 13 6 to the Kansas City Chiefs  and the 1981 AFC Wild Card Playoff game  lost 31 27 to the Buffalo Bills   For most of the Jets  tenure at Shea  they were burdened by onerous lease terms imposed at the insistence of the Mets  Until 1978  the Jets could not play their first home game until the Mets  season was finished  Even after that year  the Mets  status as Shea s primary tenants would require the Jets to go on long road trips  switching Shea from baseball to football configuration was a rather complex process  involving electrical  plumbing  field and other similar work   The stadium was also not well maintained in the 1970s  The Jets moved to Giants Stadium for the 1984 season  enticed by the additional 15 000  seats offered there  Fans ripped Shea apart after the last game of the 1983 season  which also was the last NFL appearance for Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw  who threw two touchdown passes to lead the Pittsburgh Steelers to a 34 7 victory  34  Even the scoreboard operator had a field day  displaying the home team as the  N J  Jets   35  It was at Shea Stadium on December 16  1973 that O J  Simpson became the first running back to gain 2 000 yards in a single season 36   and  to date  the only player to do it in 14 games or fewer   In the 1983 season  a Jets game against the Los Angeles Rams featured an 85 yard touchdown run by rookie Eric Dickerson  as well as a brawl between Rams offensive tackle Jackie Slater and Jets defensive end Mark Gastineau when Slater blindsided Gastineau after the Jet performed his infamous  Sack Dance  over fallen Rams quarterback Vince Ferragamo  The NFL s New York Giants played their 1975 season at Shea while Giants Stadium was being built  The Giants were 5 9 that year  2 5 at Shea   Their coach was Bill Arnsparger and their quarterback was Craig Morton  The football field at Shea extended from around home plate all the way to the outfield  with the baseline seating rotating out to fill left and right fields   edit  Soccer The first soccer game held at Shea Stadium occurred during tournament play from the International Soccer League on June 17  1965  37 New York United of the American Soccer League called Shea home in 1980  38   edit  Other events On Sunday  August 15  1965  The Beatles opened their 1965 North American tour there to a record audience of 55 600  39   Beatlemania  was at one of its peaks at the Shea Concert  Film footage taken at the concert shows many teenagers and women crying  screaming  and even fainting  The crowd noise was such that security guards can be seen covering their ears as The Beatles enter the field  The sound of the crowd was so deafening that none of The Beatles  or anyone else  could hear what they were playing  Nevertheless  it was the first concert to be held at a major stadium and set records for attendance and revenue generation  demonstrating that outdoor concerts on a large scale could be successful and profitable  and led the Beatles to return to Shea for a successful encore on 23 August 1966  The attendance record stood until 1973 when it was broken by Led Zeppelin  citation needed  40  The first major music event to play Shea Stadium after The Beatles successful run was the Summer Festival for Peace on August 6  1970  32  It was a day long fundraiser  which featured many of the era s biggest selling and seminal rock  folk  blues and jazz performers including  Janis Joplin  Paul Simon  Creedence Clearwater Revival  Steppenwolf  The James Gang  Miles Davis  Tom Paxton  John Sebastian and others  The next concert venue at Shea Stadium was the historic 1971 concert by Grand Funk Railroad  Humble Pie opened  in 1971  where they broke The Beatles then record for fastest ticket sales  Structural Engineers at the stadium were concerned that the physical excitment of the crowd that night might have caused damage to the stadium  The same film makeers for the documentary of the Rolling Stones concert at Altamont were commissioned to film this event  but the actual final film has  to date  never been releasesd  The stadium has hosted numerous concerts since  the last being a two night engagement by Billy Joel on July 16  and July 18  2008  The concerts were dubbed the  Last Play at Shea   and featured many special guest appearances  including former Beatle Paul McCartney who closed the second show with an emotional rendition of The Beatles classic  Let It Be   Other artists that joined Joel on stage for the show were former Shea performer Roger Daltrey of The Who  Tony Bennett  Don Henley  John Mayer  John Mellencamp  Garth Brooks  and Steven Tyler of Aerosmith  The concerts are the subject of a documentary film of the same name  which uses the concerts and Shea s history to tell the story of changes in American suburban life  41  Before Joel s concerts  the last performer to play there was Bruce Springsteen along with his famed backing band  the E Street Band in early October 2003  32  Other acts that have headlined at Shea are Jethro Tull with opening act Robin Trower in July 1976  billed as Tull v  Boeing due to the stadium s proximity to LaGuardia Airport   The Who with opening act The Clash in October 1982  Simon  amp  Garfunkel in August 1983  The Police with opening acts Joan Jett  amp  The Blackhearts  amp  R E M  in August 1983   a concert that bassist Sting described as  like playing the top of Mount Everest    The Rolling Stones with opening act Living Colour for a six night run in October 1989 and Elton John  amp  Eric Clapton in August 1992  The 1978 International Convention of Jehovah s Witnesses was held at Shea Stadium from July 12 to July 16  1978  32  Shea Stadium was parodied as  Che Stadium  for The Rutles film All You Need is Cash for a sequence that spoofed The Beatles  concert at the stadium During his tour of America in October 1979  Pope John Paul II was also among those hosted by Shea Stadium  42  On the morning of the Pontiff s visit  Shea Stadium was awash in torrential rain  causing ankle deep mud puddles  and threatened to ruin the event  But as the Popemobile entered the stadium  the rain stopped  On December 9  1979  as part of the halftime show of an NFL game between the New York Jets and New England Patriots  a model airplane group put on a remote control airplane display  The grand finale was a red 40 pound lawnmower  Its blade flew into the stands hitting John Bowen of Nashua  New Hampshire  Bowen died six days later  43  Between 1972 and 1980  Shea also hosted 3 wrestling events held by the then World Wrestling Federation  In 1987  Marvel Comics rented Shea Stadium to re enact the wedding of their two characters Spider Man Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson  Recently on VH1 s documentary series 7 Ages of Rock  Shea Stadium was named the most hallowed venue in all of rock music  In Godzilla  The Series the stadium was destroyed in a fight between Godzilla and Crackler  Shea Stadium was used in the 1970s for filming the 1973 movie Bang The Drum Slowly starring Robert DeNiro and Michael Moriarty and the 1978 film The Wiz  In the latter film  the exterior pedestrian ramps were used for a motorcycle chase scene with Michael Jackson  amp  Diana Ross  In Men in Black  a Mets game at Shea was featured in the film  with outfielder Bernard Gilkey dropping a flyball after being distracted by an alien spacecraft in the sky  In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks  the stadium became a staging area for rescuers  its parking lots filled with food  water  medical supplies  even makeshift shelters where relief workers could sleep  Ten days later Shea reopened for the first post attack sporting event in New York where the Mets beat the Braves  behind a dramatic home run by Mets catcher Mike Piazza  44   edit  1975  Four teams  one stadium In 1975  Shea was the center of the New York s sports universe  The Mets  Yankees  Jets and Giants all called Shea home that season  marking the first and only time in professional sports history that two baseball teams and two football teams shared the same facility in the same year  45  As Yankee Stadium was being renovated and Giants Stadium was nearing completion  there were scheduling clashes between the New York teams in baseball from April 1975 through September 1975 and both football teams from October 1975 through December 1975  Even though Shibe Park housed the Phillies  A s  and Eagles collectively from 1940 to 1954  excluding 1941   the 1975 sports calendar in Shea Stadium was unrivaled  The Jets and also the Giants could not play a  home  game at Shea Stadium until the baseball season had ended for the main tenant Mets and the temporary incumbent Yankees  The Mets attracted 1 730 566 to their games while the Yankees attracted 1 288 048 to their  home  games at Shea  Having both the Giants and Jets share Shea Stadium for one season foreshadowed what was to come in the future with the Meadowlands  a k a  Giants Stadium  after the Jets left Flushing Meadows for New Jersey following the 1983 NFL season   edit  Features  edit  Design One of the neon players on the outside of Shea Stadium  Shea was a circular stadium  with the grandstand forming a perfect circle around the field and ending a short distance beyond the foul lines  The remainder of the perimeter was mostly empty space beyond the outfield fences  This space was occupied by the bullpens  scoreboards  and a section of bleachers beyond the left field fence  The stadium boasted 54 restrooms  21 escalators and seats for 57 343  It was big  airy  sparkling  with a massive 86  x 175  scoreboard  Also  rather than the standard light towers  Shea had lamps along its upper reaches  like a convoy of semis with their brights on  which gave the field that unique high wattage glow  Praised for its convenience  even its  elegance   Shea was actually deemed a showplace  These special features helped make Shea more popular during its lifetime than other  cookie cutter  venues  like RFK Stadium  Atlanta Fulton County Stadium  and Three Rivers Stadium  44  The stadium was located close to LaGuardia Airport  For many years  interruptions for planes flying overhead were common at Shea  and the noise was so loud that radio and television broadcasts couldn t be heard  Later  flight plans were altered to alleviate the noise problem  Shea was originally designed to convert from a baseball field into a rectangle field suitable for football using two motor operated stands that allow the field level seats to rotate on underground railroad tracks  After the New York Jets football team moved to Giants Stadium in East Rutherford  New Jersey in 1984  the Mets took over operation of the stadium and retrofitted it for exclusive baseball use  As part of the refitting  Shea Stadium s exterior was painted blue and neon signs of baseball player silhouettes were added to the windscreens prior to the 1988 season  The original scoreboard was removed  and a new one installed in its place  fitting into the shell left behind by the old one   in 1988  Also at that time  the original  wooden  outfield wall was removed and replaced by a padded fence  2  Shea s exterior  pictured here in 1964  was decorated with blue and orange panels from 1964 until their removal in 1980  Banks of ramps that provided access from the ground to the upper levels were built around the outside circumference of the stadium  The ramps were not walled in and were visible from the outside  The ramps were originally partly covered with many rectangular panels in blue and orange  two of the team s colors   These panels can be seen in the 1970s movie The Wiz  it used the exterior pedestrian ramps for a motorcycle chase scene with Michael Jackson and Diana Ross  The 1960s style decorations were removed in 1980  2  The banks of ramps resulted in the outer wall of the stadium jutting out where the banks existed  In some of the recessed bays between the banks  huge neon lights formed the figures of baseball players  The design also allowed for Shea Stadium to be expandable to 90 000 seats  by completely enclosing the grandstand   or to be later enclosed by a dome if warranted  In March 1965  a plan was formally announced to add a glass dome and add 15 000 seats  19  46  The Mets strongly objected to the proposal  47  The idea was dropped after engineering studies concluded that the stadium s foundation would be unable to support the weight of the dome  19  A Shea Stadium crowd watches the Mets defeat the Dodgers on June 1st  2008  Initially  the distances to the right and left field fences were each 341 feet  104 m   There was a horizontal orange line that decided where a batted ball was a home run or still in play  In 1978  Manager Joe Torre helped move the fences in to 338 feet  103 m  in the corners with a wall now in front of the original brick wall to help alleviate disputed calls  48  Originally  all of the seats were wooden  with each level having a different color  The field boxes were yellow  the loge level seats were brown  the mezzanine seats were blue  and the upper deck seats were green  Each level above the field level was divided into box seats  below the portals  and reserved seats  above the portals   The box seats were of a darker shade than the reserved seats  The game ticket was the same color as the seat that it was for  and the signs in the lobby for that section were the same color as the seat and the ticket  Before the 1980 baseball season they were replaced with red  upper deck   green  mezzanine   blue  loge   and orange  field level  plastic seats  Shea Stadium from the air  2005  Citi Field would later be built in the parking area to the right  east  of the stadium  Unlike the crosstown Yankee Stadium  Shea was built on an open field  on top of a garbage landfill   so there was no need to have it conform to the surrounding streets  Before Shea Stadium closed in 2008  it was the only stadium in the Major Leagues with orange foul poles  This tradition is carried on at Citi Field as the foul poles there are the same color  After the Jets left Shea  the exterior of the stadium was painted blue and white  two of the Mets  team colors  In 2003  large murals celebrating the Mets  two world championships were added  covering the two ends of the grandstand  The 1986 mural was removed after the 2006 season because of deterioration  the wall was re painted solid blue  and a window was opened on the Mezzanine level where fans could view the progress of Citi Field   but the 1969 mural survived until the final game in 2008  The skyline from Shea s
