Doctor Who spin offs From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Redirected from Doctor Who  comics   Jump to  navigation  search Doctor Who spin offs refers to material created outside of  but related to  the long running British science fiction television series Doctor Who  Both during the main run of the series from 1963 to 1989 and after its cancellation  numerous novels  comic strips  comic books and other material were generated based on the characters and situations introduced in the show  These spin offs continued to be produced even without a television series to support them and helped keep the show alive in the minds of its fans and the public until the programme was revived in 2005  This entry mainly concentrates on  official  spin offs  that is to say  material sanctioned by the British Broadcasting Corporation  which produces the series  as well as material sanctioned by the copyright holders of characters from the series  One aspect of Doctor Who spin offs which makes them different from many spin offs from other science fiction franchises is that many of the television writers and stars have been directly involved in the production of spin offs  For example  it has become common for a former television actor to reprise their character for an audio play  The degree to which the spin offs are canon is a topic of much discussion by Doctor Who fans  Although the spin offs generally do not intentionally contradict the television series  the various spin off series do occasionally contradict each other  in chronology  in characters which are in one series and not the other  and in characterization  particularly of the Eighth Doctor  The Whoniverse article has more on fan debate regarding canon  Contents 1 Prose fiction 1 1 Novelisations 1 2 Original

1960s  the first being Dr  Who in an Exciting Adventure with the Daleks by David Whitaker  a loose adaptation of the show s second serial  The Daleks  Doctor Who novelisations became something of a tradition beginning in the early 1970s when Target Books  initially published by Universal Tandem  later to become part of W H  Allen  amp  Co and then Virgin Publishing  began publishing them on a regular basis  initially based upon the then current Third Doctor s episodes  but soon expanding to include all past Doctors as well  The initial three novelisations had been published in various editions both inside and outside the United Kingdom  editions appeared in the Netherlands  Canada and the United States   Further foreign editions of the novelisations appeared from the 1970s  with the books being translated for readers in the Netherlands  Brazil  Turkey  the US  where the texts were slightly tweaked to eliminate unfamiliar Anglicisms   Japan  West Germany  Portugal  France and Finland  By 1994  when the final Target book was published  all but six of the broadcast Doctor Who serials had been novelised  as well as a radio serial  Slipback   stories slated for the  missing season  but never produced due to the 18 month hiatus in 1985 1986  The Nightmare Fair  The Ultimate Evil and Mission to Magnus   the spinoff K 9 And Company  and even a 1976 children s story record  The Pescatons   which has the distinction of being the final Doctor Who book published under the Target imprint   The Target logo was retained for later reprints and intermittent new titles up to 1994 and was by this time used exclusively for Doctor Who   Most of these novelisations contained minimal amounts of original material and were  usually  adapted closely from the shooting scripts  with the intent of the books being souvenirs of previously aired shows in the pre VCR era  the decision by the BBC to delete many episodes from the Hartnell  Troughton  and Pertwee eras resulted in many of these books becoming the only way for these  lost  adventures to be experienced prior to the release of soundtracks for those episodes and or recovery of lost episodes  the Pertwee era  in particular  has been rendered intact since the early 1990s  and several Hartnell and Troughton stories are once again complete   Although novelisations became more elaborate in later years  the early books usually followed a set formula and were for a time restricted to a maximum page length as they were considered children s literature  Not all Target novelisations faithfully followed the scripts  John Lucarotti s The Massacre  1987  completely changed the plot of the source serial  The Massacre of St Bartholomew s Eve  Some guide books  notably 1999 s A Critical Guide to Doctor Who on Television by Kenneth Muir  describe the plot of the novel rather than the original serial due to the fact the original serial is one of the many that were lost  Also  when Target launched the novelisation line  there was no inkling that ultimately more than 150 of the show s storylines would be adapted  as a result  there are numerous continuity gaps between early Target books and the scripts and or later published novelisations  one example is Doctor Who and the Doomsday Weapon  based upon Colony in Space  which as written depicts Jo Grant s first adventure with the Doctor  even though the television series introduced her several serials earlier in Terror of the Autons  which was novelised at a later date and ignored the discrepancy   Authors sometimes added epilogues to their novelisations which were at odds with other material  The Curse of Fenric by Ian Briggs suggested a fate for Ace that differed from later original novels  and Philip Martin s adaptation of the Mindwarp segment of The Trial of a Time Lord included an ending that completely contradicted the scripted ending of the televised serial  After Virgin began its New Adventures and Missing Adventures line of original novels in 1991  it also published several additional novelisations both on their own and under the Missing Adventures label  These were two Dalek stories from the Troughton era  The Power of the Daleks and The Evil of the Daleks  which   along with another radio novelisation The Paradise of Death   are considered to be the last of the Target run  Later novelisations tended to be included as part of the original novel series from Virgin  The Ghosts of N Space  a second radio serial featuring Jon Pertwee produced in the mid 1990s was novelised  as were several non BBC spin off video productions such as Shakedown  as one section of a larger original novel  and Downtime  adding an air of official sanction to them  In 1996  BBC Books published a novelisation of the Doctor Who television movie  A one time return to serial novelisations occurred in 2004 when BBC Books novelised the made for Internet adventure  Scream of the Shalka  Several serials remain unnovelised for various reasons  Fan written novelisations of these stories do exist  however  The unnovelised serials are  The Pirate Planet by Douglas Adams City of Death by Graham Williams  Douglas Adams and David Fisher Resurrection of the Daleks by Eric Saward Revelation of the Daleks by Eric Saward Adams  stories were never novelised  reportedly because he wanted to do the job himself  However  soon after his tenure with Doctor Who ended  the author had gained considerable popularity because of his The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy franchise and became  depending upon the source of information  either too busy or too expensive  or both   Adams would later recycle elements of City of Death and the unbroadcast Shada into his Dirk Gently novels  As for Saward s two Dalek serials  Target Books was unable to come to an agreement which would satisfy both Eric Saward and Terry Nation s estate for the novelisations  Virgin tried again at a later date and authors were assigned for both books  but again an agreement was not reached  From 1988  Titan Books released script books of Doctor Who serials  This included an unproduced serial  The Masters of Luxor  written 1963 1964  published 1992  by Anthony Coburn  which would have been the second serial of the programme if it had not been rejected  The story features the Doctor and his companions encountering an ancient civilisation of deactivated robots  There are no plans to novelise episodes from the 2005 present revival of Doctor Who  Instead  the BBC published original novels featuring the Ninth Doctor and Tenth Doctor  with Eleventh Doctor based novels announced for 2010  and a hardback script book containing the shooting scripts for the 2005 series  Scripts for later seasons have not yet been published as of 2010  though 2005 2009 lead writer Russell T Davies has made his scripts available online  In 2007  Penguin Character Books revived the novelisations concept for the spin off series  The Sarah Jane Adventures  As of early 2010  all stories from the series  first season  two from the second  and one from the third  have been adapted  The third season novelisation  adapting  The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith   marked the first appearance of the Doctor in a TV based novelisation since the 1996 TV movie was adapted  1  Shada by Douglas Adams  not originally completed for broadcast after television production was postponed in 1979  but completed with narration for video  then remade as a webcast in 2003  will finally be released on BBC Books in 2012  1   edit  Original fiction The earliest original Doctor Who spin off fiction appeared in children s annuals from 1964  and over the years many short stories  novellas and full length novels have been published   edit  Short stories and novellas The earliest original Doctor Who fiction were short stories that appeared in the official BBC Doctor Who annuals  which were published from 1964 to 1985  and later revived by Marvel Comics as Doctor Who Year Books and as annuals by the BBC in 2005   A 45 page novella titled Doctor Who and the Invasion from Space  published in 1966  is the earliest known original long form prose Doctor Who adventure  2  Short stories also appeared in other venues such as two anniversary specials produced by the editors of the Radio Times  The first of these  1973  was Terry Nation s  We Are the Daleks   while the second  1983  had Eric Saward s  Birth of a Renegade   The former explains the origins of the Daleks and the latter reveals the background of Susan  but both contradict the series and many other stories on the subject  There were also stories in newspapers and comics  story books and even serials published on confectionery wrappers and trading cards  In 1979  Nation wrote  Daleks  The Secret Invasion   a novella included in Terry Nation s Dalek Special  this was the first original Doctor Who related fiction to be published by Target Books  During the 1990s  Virgin Publishing launched a series of Doctor Who based short story anthologies titled Decalog  A total of five volumes were published  and the last two  Decalog 4 and Decalog 5 were published after Virgin had lost the Doctor Who franchise and did not feature the Doctor  Decalog 4 concentrated on the family of Roz Forrester   a companion introduced in the NAs   over a thousand year time span  Also during the 1990s  Marvel Comics commissioned the writers of the various original novels under Virgin s New and Missing Adventures lines  see below  to write short pieces entitled  Preludes  which were run in Doctor Who Magazine  These short stories  never more than one magazine page in length  usually focused on an event just prior to a particular novel  or on a character prior to his or her encounter with the Doctor  Some non novel related short stories titled  Brief Encounters  were also written  including one in which the Seventh Doctor met a future incarnation of himself   The illustration accompanying this story based the future Doctor on actor Nicholas Briggs  who had played the Doctor in unauthorized audio dramas produced by the fan group Audio Visuals  The Briggs Doctor also appeared in the DWM comic strip   BBC Books  after it took over the licence to publish original Doctor Who fiction  published several Decalog style anthologies in the late 1990s under variations of the title Short Trips  Big Finish Productions later obtained a license to produce hardback short story anthologies and appropriated the Short Trips title  Big Finish has also published short story collections featuring Bernice Summerfield  a former companion of the Seventh and Eighth Doctors  In the early 2000s  Telos Publishing produced a series of original Doctor Who novellas  published individually in hardcover  the first  Time and Relative by Kim Newman  was released on November 23  2001  Although the series was reasonably successful  in spite of the odd publication format  which resulted from the BBC having reserved for its own use the rights to publish Doctor Who story collections and Doctor Who books in paperback   the BBC chose not to renew Telos s licence  and the series ended in March 2004  having completed 15 novellas featuring the Doctor  Prior to losing the license  a small number of Telos releases were re issued in paperback form  albeit in a larger format than the BBC Books releases  following a separate agreement with the BBC  Telos has subsequently launched a new series of novellas  Time Hunter  featuring characters created for the Doctor Who novella  The Cabinet of Light  In 2006  BBC Books launched an annual series of Doctor Who novellas as part of the government sponsored  Quick Reads Initiative  which were shorter stories  generally less than one hundred pages  intended to promote literacy in younger readers  The cover formats were the same as that for the New Series Adventures  however the books are published in paperbacks and do not have the same international distribution as the hardcovers  The first Quick Reads release was I Am a Dalek by Gareth Roberts  Released in March 2006  it was actually the first original Tenth Doctor novel to be released  predating the first series of full length Tenth Doctor novels by a month  A second volume appeared in 2007  and a third has been announced for 2008   edit  Novels After years of only novelisations being published  the first full length original Doctor Who related novels appeared in 1986 when Target launched a series of books titled The Companions of Doctor Who which were original works focusing on the Doctor s former assistants  The first two books were Turlough and the Earthlink Dilemma by Tony Attwood  published in July 1986 based upon the character played by Mark Strickson in the early 1980s and Harry Sullivan s War written by Ian Marter  who had actually played Harry Sullivan on the series a decade earlier  published in October 1986  These books sold well  but after a third attempt  a 1987 novelisation of the 1981 Doctor Who spin off  K 9 and Company  the series ended due to rights disputes between the publishers and the BBC  citation needed  Other novels would have featured Tegan  the Brigadier  Victoria and Mike Yates  Victoria eventually was the focus of the novel  and subsequent video  Downtime by Marc Platt  Yates would have appeared in The Killing Stone by actor Richard Franklin  but the novel was never published  although an abridged recording by Franklin based on the book appeared in 2002  In 1989  Target launched another short lived series of  original  novels  this time titled The Missing Episodes and based upon serials commissioned for but never produced for the cancelled 1985 1986 season  Again  only three books were published  the first being The Nightmare Fair by Graham Williams in May 1989  followed by The Ultimate Evil by Wally K  Daly in August 1989  and Mission to Magnus by Philip Martin in July 1990  Virgin Publishing s line of original novels  the New Adventures  featuring the Seventh Doctor began in July 1991 with Timewyrm  Genesys by John Peel  and were billed as telling  stories too broad and deep for the small screen   Virgin s predecessors  Target Books and W  H  Allen Ltd  had by this point been publishing novelisations for twenty years  and even before the series had come to a conclusion  successive editors of the range such as Nigel Robinson and Peter Darvill Evans had identified the need for original material to complement the few stories there were left to be novelised  The first four New Adventures were a single story arc called Timewyrm  and the first volume was controversial for including sexuality and violence of a level not encountered in the Target Books range  A second story arc  the three volume Cat s Cradle followed  after which the NA range settled into a mixture of standalone and arc stories  The New Adventures were joined in 1994 by a companion series  the Missing Adventures  telling  untold  stories with earlier Doctors  set between episodes of the television series  At its height  new novels in both lines were being published monthly  Many authors of these books went on to write for the revival of Doctor Who in 2005  Russell T Davies  Paul Cornell  Gareth Roberts  Matt Jones  and Mark Gatiss  Indeed  if one counts Steven Moffat s contribution to the second Decalog collection  then about 75  of episodes of the new series were written by people who contributed to the Virgin line   The same cannot be said of the BBC Books line  In fact  no writer who made their Doctor Who debut on the BBC Books line has written for the new series  The only writers to have contributed to the BBC line and the new series are those who also wrote for the Virgin line   Gatiss  who wrote two BBC books  and Cornell  who wrote one  Several writers from the BBC line have written tie in novels for the new series  however  including editors Justin Richards and Stephen Cole   In the climate of renewed interest in the series that followed the 1996 telemovie  the BBC decided to reclaim Virgin s licence when it next came up for renewal and publish its own series of Doctor Who novels  The last two Virgin Doctor Who novels were released in April 1997  bringing to an end almost 25 years of Doctor Who publishing outside of the BBC  with the first two BBC published novels released in June that same year  Virgin  meanwhile  continued the New Adventures line for several years afterward  focusing upon the Doctor s former assistant  Professor Bernice Summerfield who had been the first companion created specifically for literature  rather than for television  These books  sometimes referred to informally as The Adventures of Benny Summerfield  gained their own fan following and featured appearances by other characters created specifically for the literary world of Doctor Who  The BBC began releasing two new novels every two months  one featuring the ongoing adventures of the Eighth Doctor and the other an  untold  story of an earlier Doctor  referred to as the Eighth Doctor Adventures  EDAs  and Past Doctor Adventures  PDAs  respectively  Although many authors who wrote for the Virgin line returned to write for the BBC series  direct continuity between the two sets of books was discouraged  at least initially  Later  the editors loosened their policy on links between the Virgin and BBC novels  even publishing direct sequels to novels by the other publisher  for example  Justin Richards  Millennium Shock was a sequel to his earlier Virgin Missing Adventure System Shock  For the most part  however  links between the fictional ranges were kept deliberately oblique so as not to alienate new readers  In 2004  the BBC almost halved the frequency of publication from 22 books a year  one EDA and one PDA per month  to 12  each release now coming out once every other month  When the new television series began in 2005  the EDAs came to an end  with future novels featuring the Eighth Doctor to be part of the PDA range  A new line of New Series Adventures began with three Ninth Doctor novels in May 2005  Another three Ninth Doctor novels followed  after which the series continued in 2006 with original novels featuring the Tenth Doctor  As of the fall of 2007 there is no indication of any future novels being planned featuring the Ninth  or  for that matter  earlier  Doctors  The ninth Doctor novel The Monsters Inside by Stephen Cole is the first spin off novel to be referred to in the television series   in the episode  Boom Town   the Doctor and Rose s trip to the Justicia system is mentioned  In 2007  Paul Cornell s NA novel  Human Nature  was adapted  with significant changes  as the two part story Human Nature and The Family of Blood  By far  the most prolific writer of Doctor Who fiction is Terrance Dicks  who has written well over 70 titles including the majority of Target Books novelizations  as well as original works for both the Virgin and BBC Books series  In March 2007  his first work for the revived series  the Tenth Doctor adventure Made of Steel  was released in the Quick Reads format  This was the first original novel published featuring companion Martha Jones  A number of characters created for original Doctor Who fiction have been spun off into series of their own  such as the comic book Miranda based upon a character created for Lance Parkin s novel Father Time  though the comic was not a success and was cancelled after three issues  First Mad Norwegian Press and later Random Static published a series of Faction Paradox books  based on the characters created by Lawrence Miles for the novel Alien Bodies  and also republished one of the Bernice Summerfield novels originally published by Virgin  Twenty First Century Publishers are due to publish a novel featuring the character Guy de Carnac  who was introduced in the 1995 Doctor Who novel  Sanctuary  citation needed   edit  Comics Comic strip adventures of the Doctor appeared almost from the beginning of the television series  first in the 1960s publication TV Comic  and during the 1970s in the mainly Gerry Anderson related comic Countdown  later renamed TV Action  After TV Action stopped publishing  the strip returned to TV Comic until 1978  Both the First and Second Doctors were  for a time  shown travelling with two youngsters named John and Gillian who are identified as the Doctor s grandchildren  Their place within established continuity has challenged fans ever since  although attempts have been made to reconcile their existence in various spin off fiction venues  The regular Doctor Who Annuals from World Distributors published comics most years from the first annual until they ceased publication in 1985  A comic strip also regularly appeared in the pages of Doctor Who Magazine  This began as a Marvel comic under the name Doctor Who Weekly in 1979  soon changing to Doctor Who Monthly   and the magazine continued to be published after the programme ceased production in 1989  The comic strip has usually featured the current Doctor in a series of adventures independent of the novels and the audios  and with another companion  though several crossovers with the worlds of the audio and literary Doctor Who and the comics have occurred  Creators who have worked on the DWM strip include such notables as writer Alan Moore and artists Dave Gibbons  Mike McMahon and John Ridgway  Selected stories were reprinted in North America by Marvel Comics  which was also the publisher of Doctor Who Magazine at the time  When DWM was published by Marvel  some characters occasionally crossed over between the Doctor Who comic and other titles published by Marvel UK  these include the froglike Venusian businessman Josiah Dogbolter and the robotic bounty hunter Death s Head  In the  Flood Barriers  feature in the trade paperback Doctor Who  The Flood  it is revealed the comic strip was given the opportunity to show the canonical regeneration of the Eighth Doctor into the Ninth Doctor  The publishers of Doctor Who Magazine have also produced a number of special issues  annuals  and other publications containing comics  Two short lived spin off series  Miranda from Comeuppance Comics and Faction Paradox from Mad Norwegian Press  have also appeared  both featuring characters who had debuted in Doctor Who novels  Doctor Who Magazine  which is now owned by Panini Comics continues to produce new comic strip adventures  Panini has also begun to reprint the early DWM strips in trade paperback format  At the height of  Dalekmania  in the 1960s  a comic strip featuring the Daleks written by David Whitaker but credited to Terry Nation appeared in the Gerry Anderson TV Century 21 comic magazine  3  The BBC also published a number of Dalek annuals  written by Whitaker and Nation that contained a mixture of comic strips and short stories  Although much of the material in these strips directly contradicted what was shown on television later  some concepts like the Daleks using humanoid duplicates and the design of the Dalek Emperor did show up later on in the programme  The strip also featured the Mechanoids  seen in The Chase  and one annual featured Sara Kingdom and the Space Security Service  In 2005 a webcomic called The Forge  project Longinus  written by Cavan Scott and Mark Wright and illustrated by Bryan Coyle was produced as a spin off from Scott and Wright s Big Finish Productions Doctor Who audio dramas  and contained a number of unofficial references to the Doctor Who universe   edit  IDW series At the 2007 San Diego Comic Con  IDW Publishing announced their intention to publish a new series of Doctor Who comics  which would follow the adventures of the Tenth Doctor and Martha Jones  The series was scripted by Gary Russell  with art by Nick Roche  and was slated to launch later that year  It was to be composed of new material as well as republished Dave Gibbons drawn comics  each featuring all new coloring  4  Subsequently  this was split into two publications titled Doctor Who  a six issue mini series  and Doctor Who Classics respectively  A second mini series  Doctor Who  The Forgotten  by Tony Lee and Pia Guerra  began its release in August 2008 and deals with the Tenth Doctor recalling previous Doctors  adventures as an aid to fight off forced amnesia  5  6  Married writing team John Reppion and Leah Moore  together with artist Ben Templesmith  did a one shot called  The Whispering Gallery   which was released in February 2009  7  This was the first in a series of one shots  including The Time Machination  by Tony Lee and Paul Grist  in May 2009  and Autopia  by John Ostrander and Kelly Yates  in June  At the New York Comic Con in February 2009  it was announced Tony Lee would be the writer of an ongoing Doctor Who series at IDW  8   edit  Television The first spin off attempt that actually reached the production stage appeared in 1981  when a 50 minute pilot episode for a series to be called K 9 and Company was aired  It focused on the adventures of former Doctor Who companions Sarah Jane Smith and K 9  a robot dog  The pilot  subtitled  A Girl s Best Friend   despite receiving high ratings of 8 4 million  9  was not commissioned for a development into a series  though Sarah Jane and K 9 would later reappear together on the main Doctor Who series and her adventures would be continued in audio form by Big Finish Productions in the 2000s  Since the return of Doctor Who in 2005  the show has been companioned with a documentary series  Doctor Who Confidential  On 17 October 2005  The Independent reported that the BBC had commissioned Davies to produce a 13 part spin off

Jean Marc Lofficier  Virgin Publishing  1997  includes synopses of several proposed film story treatments  including those by Byrne   edit  Video The hunger for more Doctor Who on television  especially between the show s cancellation in 1989 and its return in 2005  was partly answered by direct to video productions by various companies  The BBC has never authorised any Doctor Who video productions but production companies have been able to license individual characters and alien races from the show directly from the writers who created them  and feature them in adventures of their own  Companies who have released videos of this kind include Reeltime Pictures  also known for the long running Myth Makers series of documentaries  and BBV  who have also released a number of Doctor Who related audio adventures on the same basis   The first spinoff of this nature was Wartime  a half hour film produced by Reeltime in the late 1980s and starring John Levene as Benton  a UNIT soldier who appeared on Doctor Who in the early to mid 1970s  In the 1990s  Reeltime distributed P R O B E   a series of four made for video movies featuring Caroline John as her Pertwee era character  Dr  Elizabeth Shaw  BBV  on their part  produced and released a trilogy of movies  Auton  Auton 2  Sentinel and Auton 3 that featured UNIT battling the Nestene Consciousness  Author Terrance Dicks also wrote and produced Shakedown  Return of the Sontarans in 1994  which not only featured the reappearance of one of the series  most famous monsters  but also starred series alums Carole Ann Ford  Sophie Aldred  and Michael Wisher  Jan Chappell played Lisa Deranne  captain of the solar racing yacht Tiger Moth  whose shakedown cruise is interrupted by a Sontaran attack squad furiously searching for a Rutan infiltrator  Another spinoff  Downtime  featured the return of Nicholas Courtney as Brigadier  Ret   Lethbridge Stewart and Elisabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith  along with Deborah Watling as Troughton era companion Victoria Waterfield  More of a nostalgia trip for fans than anything  Downtime provided a more detailed look at Lethbridge Stewart s family and legacy than had ever been seen before  Reeltime Pictures also produced two other Doctor Who universe related videos  Mindgame and Mindgame Trilogy  In 1998 a video was released called Lust in Space in which the  Time Assizes   Time Lords  put Doctor Who on trial for sexism  If it is found to be sexist  then it will be removed from history  None of the actors who had played the part of the Doctor took part  The  evidence  for the trial consists of short clips of interviews of some of the Doctor s female companions  Katy Manning  Jo Grant  and Sophie Aldred  Ace  are brought through time and space to testify in court  Former writers and producers such as Terrance Dicks and John Nathan Turner are cross examined through video interviews on their part in making the show  sexist   There are no clips from Doctor Who in the video  BBV is also known for a number of productions that  while not using any elements from the show itself  tell a similar style of story and feature ex Doctor Who stars in roles similar to those they played in the series  these include a direct to video series starring Colin Baker as  The Stranger   and a separate series of audio dramas starring Sylvester McCoy as  The Dominie   In later episodes of The Stranger  it was made clear that not only was the Stranger not the Doctor but that their backgrounds were not even remotely analogous  Some of this clarification appears to have been the result of BBC pressure  Some contributors to these independent productions in the 1990s later contributed to the television series after its return  They include writer performers Mark Gatiss and Nicholas Briggs and novelist modelmaker Mike Tucker   edit  Audio Main articles  Doctor Who audio productions  Doctor Who audio releases Many audio productions based upon Doctor Who have been produced over the years  The first  in 1976  was a children s audio adventure entitled Doctor Who and the Pescatons by Victor Pemberton  In 1985  during a period when the series was on a sabbatical at the BBC  BBC Radio hired Colin Baker and his TV companion Nicola Bryant to reprise their TV roles for a new production called Slipback  In the 1990s  the BBC began issuing the soundtracks of serials from the 1960s on cassette and compact disc  initially these were the  lost  episodes  but have also included serials from the 1970s and 1980s  There were also two further radio dramas  The Paradise of Death  1993  and The Ghosts of N Space  1996   both featuring Jon Pertwee  which like Slipback were first broadcast on BBC Radio  Beginning in 1999  Big Finish Productions  under licence from the BBC  began a range of audio plays on compact disc  with one released every month  Big Finish have also produced a limited run series of audio plays based around one of the Doctor s former television companions  Sarah Jane Smith  as well as a limited Doctor Who Unbound series that explores possibilities contrary to the established mythos  for instance   What if the Doctor had never left Gallifrey     From 6 August 2005  several of the Eighth Doctor audio dramas are being broadcast on the digital radio station BBC 7   these are Storm Warning  Sword of Orion  The Stones of Venice  Invaders from Mars  Shada and The Chimes of Midnight  A new series of original audio dramas featuring the Eighth Doctor and new companion Lucie Miller began airing on BBC7 on 31 December 2006  These are Blood of the Daleks  Horror of Glam Rock  Immortal Beloved  Phobos  No More Lies and Human Resources  A second series of audios featuring the Eighth Doctor and Lucie Miller were broadcast on BBC7 in 2009  having first been released on CD by Big Finish Productions  Since 2003  Darker Projects produced their own version of Doctor Who featuring an all new Doctor on darker adventures  Currently its flagship  it has been since became independently anonymous from 2009 onwards after getting a new Doctor and a new companion the previous year  In addition  a spot for the  United Trek Federation  at the sixth episode of Star Trek  The Section 31 Files third season features the  Who World Order   In this particular spot  the Who World Order causes tragic acts of computer terrorism by subsituting Doctor Who in place of Star Trek episodes they mention  including Star Trek  Hidden Frontier and The Section 31 Files itself  and dragging one of them off to the  Who Relocation Camps   this causes many to wake and wonder today the day these will literally happen  but this changed with the United Trek Federation protecting them  Also  a young woman brags about her Trek DVDs stolen by the  Dinomonster   who was shot down by  specially trained  agents  In 2009 and 2010  Big Finish Productions released further series of  old  material  firstly audio versions of Doctor Who stage plays from the 1960s to 1980s  This was followed by the  lost  season 23 featuring the Sixth Doctor   these were scripts originally written for the season that was cancelled before returning in the Trial of a Time Lord  The second season of The Lost Stories  to be released in 2010 dated info   includes audio versions of unmade episodes featuring the First Doctor and Second Doctor  the original  Dalek  pilot made for US television  and stories originally commissioned for the cancelled season 27 featuring the Seventh Doctor  There are also several other Doctor Who related audio mini series including Dalek Empire  Dalek Empire II  Dalek War  and Dalek Empire III  Gallifrey  UNIT  Kaldor City and Faction Paradox Protocols  The canonicity of these audio productions is uncertain  even though several were commissioned by and broadcast by the BBC  albeit on radio  in particular Slipback  the Pertwee serials  and the more recent BBC7 McGann series    edit  Stage The universe of Doctor Who has been adapted several times for the stage  The earliest such production was The Curse of the Daleks  written by David Whitaker and Terry Nation and directed by Gillian Howell  which played at Wyndham s Theatre over the December 1965 January 1966 Christmas theatre season  Whitaker s play was intended to link the televised serials The Daleks and Dalek Invasion of Earth and elements later appeared in the Daleks comic strip that later ran in TV21  23  The Daleks also play a major role in the first produced stageplay to feature the Doctor  Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday was written by Terrance Dicks and directed by Mick Hughes and ran at London s Adelphi Theatre over the 1974 75 Christmas season and then toured England until April 1975  Trevor Martin played an alternate version of the Fourth Doctor in this play  which takes place immediately after the Third Doctor s regeneration in Planet of the Spiders  the play was staged before Tom Baker s official debut as the Fourth Doctor in early 1975 although Baker had appeared at the close of Planet of the Spiders   The play co starred former Doctor Who companion Wendy Padbury  playing a different character named Jenny   Also in the cast was Simon Jones as the  Master of Karn   several years before he worked with Doctor Who writer Douglas Adams on The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  The play was not well attended by audiences as it debuted during an upswing of IRA violence in London  24  UNIT was the focus of Recall UNIT  or  The Great Tea Bag Mystery   a play mounted in August 1984 at the Moray House Theatre in Edinburgh  The play was directed and co written by Richard Franklin  who had played Mike Yates in the series  and he reprised the role for the play  along with John Levene who returned as Sergeant Benton  The Daleks once again returned  as did Nicholas Courtney whose recorded voice allowed Brigadier Alistair Lethbridge Stewart to also take part in the play  albeit off stage  25  Doctor Who   The Ultimate Adventure was mounted at Wimbledon Theatre in London for several months starting in March 1989  This musical play paired the Doctor with a set of new companions in a battle against not only the Daleks but the Cybermen as well  Jon Pertwee initially starred in the play for the first half of its run  reprising the Third Doctor  For the second half of the run  Colin Baker starred as the Sixth Doctor  For two performances during Pertwee s tenure  Davis Banks  best known for playing various Cybermen in the TV series  played the Doctor when Pertwee fell ill  26  From October to November 2010  Doctor Who Live toured in arenas across Britain  In July 2011  as part of the Manchester International Festival  a live production  The Crash of the Elysium   2  ran in and around the new BBC developments in Media City  This was an interactive play  aimed at children  where the actors lead the audience through the set  with set piece events occurring at various points  It featured filmed footage of the Eleventh Doctor  and weeping angels   edit  Webcasts A series of audio plays have also been webcast on bbc co uk  beginning with Death Comes to Time in 2001  The first episode had been made for  and then turned down by  BBC Radio 4 and after an experimental webcasting of this pilot generated over a million page hits  the rest of the episodes were produced and webcast  The serial featured Sylvester McCoy reprising his role as the Seventh Doctor  Despite Death Comes to Time s award winning success  political wrangling behind the scenes meant the next two serials made specially for webcasts were by Big Finish Productions  Real Time  2002   with the Sixth Doctor versus the Cybermen and Shada  2003   with Paul McGann as the Eighth Doctor in a script originally written by Douglas Adams and intended for the Fourth Doctor Tom Baker in 1979  but abandoned halfway through filming back then due to a BBC staff strike  Although all of these adventures were intended as purely audio and were later released on CD  as webcasts they were accompanied by a slideshow of partially animated illustrations drawn by artist Lee Sullivan  Death Comes to Time was also released as a special MP3 CD with interactive content  including an option to view the illustrations as well as other bonus material such as cast and crew interviews that were originally available online  In the middle of 2003  BBCi initiated plans to bring webcast production back in house  producing the all new adventure Scream of the Shalka by Paul Cornell  starring Richard E  Grant as the Ninth Doctor and Derek Jacobi as the Master  This differed from the previous webcasts in that it was specifically an audio visual experience and not an audio adventure  it was fully animated to broadcast standard  although the webcast version was slightly simplified for that medium  by the Cosgrove Hall animation company  and webcast over five weeks in November and December 2003  The adventures were originally intended to be an official continuation of the Doctor Who mythos  and Grant was  for a brief time  touted as the New Doctor  However  with the announcement of the new BBC television series  Shalka was relegated to non official status  and Russell T Davies  producer of the 2005 revival series  has referred to Christopher Eccleston as the Ninth Doctor  Plans for further webcasts were shelved as well as a DVD release of the serial  A novelisation was  however  released by BBC Books in February 2004  complete with a lengthy  making of  section  The canonical status of the remaining webcasts is also uncertain  and is made murkier by the fact that the webcasts could be considered canonical since they were broadcast by a branch of the BBC  Most of the webcasts feature elements that contradict series continuity  most notably Death Comes to Time which some fans have used to support their view that the 1996 television movie and 2005 television series  and all related spinoffs  are not canon   edit  Merchandise Main article  Doctor Who merchandise Doctor Who has generated many hundreds of products related to the show since its beginnings in the 1960s  from toys and games to picture cards
