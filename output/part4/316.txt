requires expansion  Created by Frank Miller  Elektra first appeared in Daredevil  168  January 1981   She has appeared in two eponymous ongoing series and several mini series   edit  Fictional character biography According to Marvel Comics  Elektra is the world s most lethal woman and one of Marvel s most cold blooded characters  She has killed more men citation needed than just about any other Marvel character while remaining one of the most popular heroines in the Marvel Universe  Some features or history details in other versions may differ significantly from Frank Miller s original   edit  Family and early life Elektra was born on a Greek island near the Aegean Sea to Hugo Kostas Natchios and his wife Christina Natchios  She had an older brother named Orestez Natchios  in Greek the name should be O         i e  Orestes with Latin alphabet   Two contradictory accounts of her family history have been given in various issues  In Elektra  Root of Evil  1 4  March   June 1995   it is stated that her father was an aspiring diplomat who eventually managed to gain his first assignment as an ambassador to an unspecified country  However  Hugo and his wife had grown apart  Christina had begun a series of extramarital affairs with no apparent interest in keeping them secret  resulting in personal humiliation for her husband  Popular opinion in diplomatic circles stated that a man unable to control his wife had no business deciding on the fate of the world  When Christina became pregnant for a second time  Hugo was certain the child was not his own  Hugo confided to his adolescent son that his mother was a whore who was shaming their family  Orestez promised his father that Christina would never again shame them  Hugo failed to understand the meaning of these words  On August 13 of that year  the couple was on holiday in the Aegean Sea  They were located by a helicopter which opened fire on them both  The assassins left them for dead  The couple was taken to a nearby hospital  Christina gave premature birth to Elektra and then died  Hugo recovered from his wounds  Orestez had hired the assassins in order to indirectly commit matricide  He was horrified by the idea of unintentional patricide and ran away from home  Hugo was the only family left to Elektra  At first  Hugo had no intention to raise this  bastard  child  However  a paternity test confirmed the child to be his own  Hugo was not sorry for losing Christina  He was grateful  however  for her giving him a daughter  He arranged for a beautiful headstone to be placed on her grave  Images of the Erinyes on the headstone implied however that Christina was responsible for her own death  Hugo grew to adore Elektra  He nicknamed her his  Little Amber  and showered her with gifts  Her favorite gift was a pet dog of her own  named Agamemnon  continuing the pattern of Hugo naming members of his family after the Atreidae  The dog was killed when a nine year old Elektra was assaulted by kidnappers  The men were all killed by Orestez  who had grown into an accomplished martial artist after leaving home  He did not explain his presence there  He briefly acquainted himself to his little sister and then left again  However  Orestez had a lasting effect in her life  He advised his father that Elektra needed to learn self defense  Hugo hired a sensei to teach her the martial arts  beginning her acquaintance with fighting   edit  Contradictory accounts A different account was told in Elektra  Vol  2   18  May 1998   The account was told to Wolverine by an old family retainer by the name of  Stavros   Stavros had reportedly met Hugo and Christina during World War II  at the time of Greece s occupation by Nazi Germany  Stavros was leader to a small group of the Greek Resistance movement  A younger Hugo was a leader of a greater covert cell which operated in the same area  A 15 year old Christina was also part of the cell and operated as a messenger  She brought a message to Stavros one day  an order to join her commandant and fight under his orders  Stavros replied to this arrogant message with laughter until Christina drew her gun and threatened his life  The following day  Stavros joined a leader who was able to inspire such determination to his followers  Christina would prove her worth many times during the resistance  She married Hugo after the war  They were not involved in the Greek Civil War  However  the later war cost Christina her life  Christina was in the eighth month of her pregnancy when Hugo had to go to Athens  Attica on  government matters   Stavros was left behind to take care of her  He accompanied her to the clinic to see the family doctor and was then dismissed for an hour  During that hour   a man who considered himself a patriot   but wanted by the Greek Army invaded the clinic  He killed the doctor and attempted to take the patient as a hostage  Christina attempted to convince him to stop the unnecessary violence  but was shot in the chest  She used her old combat training to take the man down  She then had to stop the other patients from assaulting the already defeated man until his arrest yet she was mortally wounded and gave premature birth  Elektra was born on the clinic floor  painted red from the blood of her mother  Christina died before hearing the first cry of her daughter  The issue was scripted by Larry Hama and drawn by Mike Deodato  The two versions of the nature of Christina Natchios  death cannot be reconciled  Furthermore  Elektra  Assassin  1  August 1986  placed ambiguity on the relationship Elektra had with her father  The adult Elektra recalled vague memories of being raped by her father as a 5 year old  Years of counseling and medication had convinced her this was a false memory  but the doubt remained  Another memory had the 6 year old Elektra sitting on Hugo s lap while her teasing father compared her to a cat  likely the Cheshire Cat from Alice s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll  Elektra grew up close to her father but was plagued by dark visions and voices with no known source  She occasionally reacted to them with self harm  Her father eventually sent her away to psychotherapy until becoming more stable  It was uncertain whether Elektra actually became more stable or merely appeared to  The issue was scripted by Frank Miller and drawn by Bill Sienkiewicz  Cover to Daredevil Vol  1  168  Elektra s first appearance  misspelt as  Elecktra    Art by Frank Miller   edit  Activities as an adult Hugo Natchios is known to have eventually served as a Greek ambassador to the United States  19 year old Elektra first attended Columbia University  New York City  New York  There  Elektra met the man who would become her boyfriend  Matt Murdock  A year later  twenty year old Elektra and her father were kidnapped by terrorists  Matt wore a mask for the first time and started a rescue attempt  Elektra used the distraction to strike down some of the terrorists  However  one of the defeated men fell out of a window  The police assumed the terrorists had started throwing their hostages out of the window  They opened fire and killed the man closest to the window  Hugo Natchios  right in front of his daughter s eyes  Elektra lost faith and hope  She quit Columbia and returned to China to study martial arts  Stick  a member of the benevolent organization called the Chaste  recognized the darkness in her soul and attempted to train her himself  but she ultimately sided with the Hand  a sect of mystical ninja  who trained her as an assassin  She later broke away from them and became an independent agent  and in this role she again encountered Matt Murdock  who was now active as Daredevil  She battled Daredevil in order to force him to help her capture the criminal Alarich Wallenquist  and Daredevil saved her from being killed by Eric Slaughter  3  She soon learned of his double identity  and although the pair worked together to fight the Hand  they also came into conflict frequently  Elektra later first battled the Hand alongside Daredevil and Gladiator  4  She then battled Kirigi  5  Cover to Daredevil Vol  1

from terrorizing Ben Urich  7  The Kingpin then assigned her to kill Matt Murdock s partner  Franklin  Foggy  Nelson  When Nelson recognized Elektra as Matt s college girlfriend  she was unable to kill him  Elektra was fatally stabbed by Bullseye with one of her own sai in a battle over which of them would be the Kingpin s assassin  Elektra managed to crawl to Daredevil s house before dying in his arms as Bullseye watched the two  hidden among a crowd that had gathered to see what was going on  8  Later  members of The Hand stole her body and attempted to resurrect her  Daredevil  with the assistance of Stone  a member of Stick s order  intervened  defeating The Hand ninja  Daredevil then tried to revive Elektra himself  Although his attempt failed  it did have the effect of purifying Elektra s soul  Elektra s body subsequently disappeared  as did Stone  9  Years later  Stick would send her to aid the X Man Wolverine  at a time when he had been physically and mentally regressed to a bestial form  She helped retrain him to the point where he could think and vocalize as a human once more  and spent time with him thereafter as he returned to his normal form  including taking him with her on a return to her ancestral home  10  Some time after her partnership with Wolverine ended  it was revealed that when Elektra was resurrected by Stone  Elektra s evil aspect had been physically split apart from her in its own body as a consequence of the ritual performed by Daredevil  Her darker half  calling itself Erynys  fought Elektra and was killed by her  thus returning the dark side to Elektra s soul  11  She was hired by Nick Fury to assassinate Saddam Abed Dassam  the leader of Iraq who was in league with HYDRA  and retrieve the Scorpio Key from them  Fury hired her as a way to avoid accountability in global political circles  Along the way HYDRA tried to hire her  an offer she refused  They then set the Silver Samurai on to her and it appeared she killed him though he appeared alive and well in other comics  When she eventually obtained the Key  she refused to give it to Fury  believing that he could not be trusted with such a powerful weapon  She instead gave it to the police officer who had killed her father stating that he had a debt to her and he would not let her down  12   edit  Wolverine  Enemy of the State Elektra was one of the  good guys  when she worked with S H I E L D  13  HYDRA and The Hand joined forces  killing off various heroes and resurrecting them into their possessed warriors  including the X Man Wolverine  who became their killing machine  14  Based on her relationship with Logan and her ties to the Hand  Nick Fury hired Elektra to lead the mission  paying her in excess of  200 000  more money in one day than the  then

part of a plan she had from the beginning  She explained that she had been resurrected by The Hand and infiltrated the organization  making them believe they had been successful in resurrecting her as a brainwashed warrior  She told him that they would take The Hand and HYDRA down together  They fought off many ninja and were victorious  18 Gorgon  however  attacked Elektra and threw off her mental blocks  enabling him to read her thoughts and see where Fury was being treated for his injuries  he also discovered that the Vatican also hired her  to kill him   Gorgon teleported  with Elektra  to

be her own version of The Hand  He also told Kitty that Elektra was no threat    so far  It was unknown where Elektra really was or what her plans were  but it was during the time following the

also able to keep to the shadows and move with such speed that she can remain unseen even in daylight  thus explaining why she is one of Marvel s top killers  Elektra has demonstrated on occasion the ability to mesmerize others  and as such make them see illusions or other phenomena  Elektra s also has the ability to  throw  her mind into those of others  For instance  she was able to track down her enemy  Ken Wind  by temporarily  borrowing  people s minds and acting through them while she hunted around for her prey  This temporal mind control enables her to metaphorically sniff out the psyche  or intent  of her targets  It saw extensive use during Elektra  Assassin  in which she was heavily reliant on only her ninja powers  It is unknown how long the effect lasts  but Elektra has gone a full four months in someone else s mind while simultaneously swapping two other people s minds  volume  amp  issue needed  Elektra has occasionally demonstrated low level telekinesis  though it is possible that this may be an illusion which victims of her mesmerism are led to see  She can communicate telepathically with individuals possessing similar levels of mental discipline  such as the
