the article  The Vesting Clause  Section One  vests  all legislative powers herein granted  to the Congress  Sections Two and Three deal with the House of Representatives and Senate respectively  The sections set the composition  term lengths  qualifications of members  officers  and methods of filling vacancies for both Houses  Section Two also requires direct taxes to  be apportioned among the several States   according to their respective Numbers  and that a census be held every ten years  Section Three also provides that the Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate but shall have only a tie breaking vote  The House of Representatives is given the sole power of impeachment while the Senate is given the sole power of the trial of impeachments  Section Four gives to state legislatures the power to set the  times  Places and Manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives   but provides for Congressional oversight of elections  The section also provides that Congress shall assemble  at least once in every year  and sets a default date for the initial assembly  later modified by the Twentieth Amendment  Section Five deals with procedure  providing that  Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections  Returns and Qualifications of its own Members  and a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business   although a small number may adjourn and compel the attendance of absent members  The section also gives to each house the power to  determine the rules of its proceedings   including the power to punish or expel a member   Each house is required to  keep a journal of its proceedings  and publish it from time to time except in special circumstances  The section also provides that neither House may adjourn without the consent of the other for more than three days or change its meeting place  without the consent of the other House  Section Six provides that members of Congress shall receive salaries  have a limited privilege from arrest during sessions of Congress  and immunity  for any Speech or Debate in either House   The section also provides that no member may simultaneously serve in Congress and  be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States   and also may not serve in any such office  which shall have been created  or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased  during the member s term in office  Section Seven deals with legislative procedure  providing that all bills for revenue must originate in the House of Representative  The section also introduces the veto power of the President of the United States  and describes its powers and limitations  Section Eight gives to the Congress certain broad enumerated powers  Among these are the power to lay and collect taxes and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States  to borrow money on the credit of the United States  to regulate interstate  foreign  and Indian commerce   5  To coin money  regulate the value thereof  and of foreign coin  and fix the standard of weights and measures  and to create courts inferior to the Supreme Court among many others  The section also gives to Congress the power to  make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers  and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States   Section Nine places limits on powers of Congress and the government  The section provides that the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended  except when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it   prohibits bills of attainder or ex post facto laws  bars the imposition of taxes or duties on articles exported from any state or the granting of preference to ports of one state over another  and prohibits civil officers from accepting titles of nobility without the consent of Congress  The section also provides that  No money shall be drawn from the treasury  but in consequence of appropriations made by law   and that a statement of receipts and expenditures of public money  be published from time to time   This section barred Congress from banning the import of slaves from abroad or from laying a duty of more than 10 dollars on each imported slave until 1808  Congress banned the slave trade on January 1  1808  as soon as constitutionally allowed  Section Ten sets limits on states  reserving certain powers exclusively to the Congress  States are prohibited from coining money or making anything other than gold or silver coin legal tender for payment of debts and are prohibited from entering into treaties or alliances  although compacts with other states are allowed with the permission of Congress  States are also not permitted to lay duties  keep troops or warships in peacetime with Congressional approval  or engage in war unless actually invaded or in imminent danger  States also are barred from laying imposts or duties on imports or exports except for the fulfillment of state inspection laws  which may be revised by Congress  and any net revenue of such duties is remitted to the federal treasury  Finally  states  like Congress  may not pass bills of attainder or ex post facto laws  nor grant any title of nobility   edit  Section 1  Legislative power vested in Congress All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States  which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives  Section 1 is a vesting clause  granting all the federal government s legislative authority to Congress  Similar vesting clauses are found in Articles II and III  which grant  the executive power  to the President and  the judicial power  to the federal judiciary  In legal garb  the working definition of  herein  connotes specificity and exclusivity  The Vesting Clauses thus establishes the principle of separation of powers by specifically giving to each branch of the federal government only those powers it can exercise and no others  1  This means that no branch may exercise powers that properly belong to another  e g   since the legislative power is vested in Congress  the executive and judiciary may not enact laws   2  The language  herein granted  in Article I s vesting clause has been interpreted to mean that the powers Congress are to exercise are exclusively those specifically provided for in Article I  3  The clause  herein granted  was further defined and elaborated by the tenth amendment  Thus  this congressional clause is contrasted by the general vesting of the executive and judicial powers in Articles II and III in the branches of government those articles govern  which has been interpreted to mean that those branches enjoy  residual  or  implied  powers beyond those specifically mentioned  as contrasted with the Congress  which is vested with those legislative powers  herein granted   4  however  there is substantial contemporary disagreement about the precise extent of the powers conferred by the general vesting clauses  As a corollary to the fact that Congress  and only Congress  is vested with the legislative power  Congress  in theory  cannot delegate legislative authority to other branches of government  e g   the Executive Branch   a rule known as the nondelegation doctrine  5  However  the Supreme Court has ruled that Congress does have latitude to delegate regulatory powers to executive agencies as long as it provides an  intelligible principle  which governs the agency s exercise of the delegated regulatory authority  6  In practice  the Supreme Court has only invalidated four statutes on non delegation grounds in its history  three of which were invalidated in the mid 1930s  The fourth  the Line Item Veto Act of 1996  was invalidated in 1998  7  The nondelegation doctrine is primarily used now as a way of interpreting a congressional delegation of authority narrowly  8  in that the courts presume Congress intended only to delegate that which it certainly could have  unless it clearly demonstrates it intended to  test the waters  of what the courts would allow it to do  9  Although not specifically mentioned in the Constitution  Congress has also long asserted the power to investigate and the power to compel cooperation with an investigation  10  The Supreme Court has affirmed these powers as an implication of Congress s power to legislate  11  Since the power to investigate is an aspect of Congress s power to legislate  it is as broad as Congress s powers to legislate  12  However  it is also limited to inquiries that are  in aid of the legislative function   13  Congress may not  expose for the sake of exposure   14  It is uncontroversial that a proper subject of Congress s investigation power is the operations of the federal government  but Congress s ability to compel the submission of documents or testimony from the President or his subordinates is often discussed and sometimes controversial  see executive privilege   although not often litigated  As a practical matter  the limitation of Congress s ability to investigate only for a proper purpose   in aid of  its legislative powers  functions as a limit on Congress s ability to investigate the private affairs of individual citizens  matters that simply demand action by another branch of government  without implicating an issue of public policy necessitating legislation by Congress  must be left to those branches due to the doctrine of separation of powers  15  The courts are highly deferential to Congress s exercise of its investigation powers  however  Congress has the power to investigate that which it could regulate  12  and the courts have interpreted Congress s regulatory powers broadly since the Great Depression  Additionally  the courts will not inquire into whether Congress has an improper motive for an investigation  i e   using a legitimate legislative purpose as a cover for  expos ing  for the sake of exposure    focusing only on whether the matter is within Congress s power to regulate and  thus  investigate  16  Persons called before a congressional investigatory committee are entitled to the constitutional guarantees of individual rights  such as those in the Bill of Rights  17  Congress can punish those who do not cooperate with an investigation via holding violators in contempt of Congress  18   edit  Section 2  House of Representatives  edit  Clause 1  Composition and election of Members The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States  and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature  Section Two provides for the election of the House of Representatives every second year  Since Representatives are to be  chosen       by the People   State Governors are not allowed to appoint temporary replacements when vacancies occur in a state s delegation to the House of Representatives  instead  the Governor of the state is required by clause 4 to issue a writ of election calling a special election to fill the vacancy  The Constitution does not directly guarantee the franchise to anyone  19  rather  it provides that those qualified to vote in elections for the largest chamber of a state s legislature may vote in congressional elections as well  Amendments to the Constitution  however  have restricted the states  ability to set such qualifications  20  The Fifteenth Amendment and Nineteenth Amendment bar the use of race or sex as qualifications to vote in both federal and state elections  Furthermore  the Twenty sixth Amendment provides that states may not set age requirements higher than eighteen years  The Twenty fourth Amendment bars states from using the payment of a tax as a voter qualification in federal elections  Moreover  since the Supreme Court has recognized voting as a fundamental right  21  the Equal Protection Clause places very tight limitations  albeit with uncertain limits  on the states  ability to define voter qualifications  it is fair to say that qualifications beyond citizenship  residency  and age are usually questionable  22  Since clause 3 provides that Members of the House of Representatives are apportioned state by state and that each state is guaranteed at least one Representative  exact population equality between all districts is not guaranteed and  in fact  is currently impossible  because while the size of the House of Representatives is fixed at 435  several states had less than 1 435 of the national population at the time of the last reapportionment in 2000  23  However  the Supreme Court has interpreted the provision of Clause One that Representatives shall be elected  by the People  to mean that  in those states with more than one member of the House of Representatives  each congressional election district within the state must have nearly identical populations  24   edit  Clause 2  Qualifications of Members No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years  and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States  and who shall not  when elected  be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen  The Constitution provides three requirements for Representatives  A Representative must be at least 25 years old  must be an inhabitant of the state in which he or she is elected  and must have been a citizen of the United States for the previous seven years  There is no requirement that a Representative reside within the district in which he represents  although thus is usually the case  there have been occasional exceptions  25  The Supreme Court has interpreted the Qualifications Clause as an exclusive list of qualifications that cannot be supplemented by a house of Congress exercising its Section 5 authority to  judge   the   qualifications of its own members  26  or by a state in its exercise of its Section 4 authority to prescribe the  times  places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives   The Supreme Court  as well as other federal courts  have repeatedly barred states from additional restrictions  such as imposing term limits on members of Congress  allowing members of Congress to be subject to recall elections  or requiring that Representatives live in the congressional district in which they represent  27  28  However  the United States Supreme Court has ruled that certain ballot access requirements  such as filing fees and submitting a certain number of valid petition signatures do not constitute additional qualifications and thus few Constitutional restrictions exist as to how harsh ballot access laws can be   edit  Clause 3  Apportionment of Representatives and taxes Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union  according to their respective Numbers  which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons  including those bound to Service for a Term of Years  and excluding Indians not taxed  three fifths of all other Persons  The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States  and within every subsequent Term of ten Years  in such Manner as they shall by Law direct  The number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand  but each State shall have at Least one Representative  and until such enumeration shall be made  the State of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse  sic  three  Massachusetts eight  Rhode Island and Providence Plantations one  Connecticut five  New York six  New Jersey four  Pennsylvania eight  Delaware one  Maryland six  Virginia ten  North Carolina five  South Carolina five  and Georgia three  The Constitution does not fix the size of the House of Representatives  instead  this clause empowers Congress to determine the size of the House as part of the apportionment process  29  so long as the size of the House does not exceed 1 member for every 30 000 of the country s total population 30  and the size of the state s delegation does not exceed 1 for every 30 000 of the state s population 31   although these limits have not been approached since the Founding 32    The number is currently fixed at 435  which is around a 1 Representative  700 000 Citizen ratio  33  A particular number of Representatives is assigned to each State according to its share of the national population  election districts are not drawn nationally and do not cross state boundaries  34  Congress additionally has the authority to prescribe what method shall be used to allocate Representatives to each state  29  currently  Congress has prescribed the use of the Equal Proportions method  35  The Constitution mandates that a Census be conducted every ten years to determine the populations of the States  and this clause provided for a temporary apportionment of seats until the first Census could be conducted  The population of a state originally included  for congressional apportionment purposes  all  free persons   three fifths of  other persons   i e   slaves  and excluded untaxed Native Americans  Presently  the Census counts illegal immigrants  and Census figures are used to determine congressional seats  The three fifths clause was a compromise between Southern and Northern states in which three fifths of the population of slaves would be counted for enumeration purposes regarding both the distribution of taxes and the apportionment of the members of the United States House of Representatives  This compromise had the effect of increasing the political power of slave holding states by increasing their share of seats in the House of Representatives  and consequently their share in the Electoral College  where a state s influence over the election of the President is tied to the size of its congressional delegation   Following the Civil War  the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments changed this arrangement by  respectively  abolishing slavery  and superseding the three fifths clause by requiring that a state s population for apportionment purposes was to be determined by  counting the whole number of Persons  in the state   excluding Indians not taxed   Since there are at present no such untaxed Native Americans  Indians   36  all persons inhabiting a state   whether citizens or not   count towards the population of that state in determining the state s congressional apportionment  Originally  the amount of direct taxes that could be collected from any State was tied directly to its share of the national population  On the basis of this requirement  application of the income tax to income derived from real estate and specifically income in the form of dividends from personal property ownership such as stock shares was found to be unconstitutional because it was not apportioned among the states  37  that is to say  there was no guarantee that a State with 10  of the country s population paid 10  of those income taxes collected  because Congress had not fixed an amount of money to be raised and apportioned it between the States according to their respective shares of the national population  To permit the levying of such an income tax  Congress proposed and the states ratified the Sixteenth Amendment  which superseded this requirement by specifically providing that Congress could levy a tax on income  from whatever source derived  without it being apportioned among the States or otherwise based on a State s share of the national population   edit  Clause 4  Vacancies When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State  the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such Vacancies  Section 2  Clause 4  provides that when vacancies occur in the House of Representatives  it is not the job of the House of Representatives to arrange for a replacement  but the job of the State whose vacant seat is up for refilling  Moreover  the State Governor may not appoint a temporary replacement  but must instead arrange for a special election to fill the vacancy  The original qualifications and procedures for holding that election are still valid   edit  Clause 5  Speaker and other officers  Impeachment The House of Representatives shall chuse  sic  their Speaker and other Officers  and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment  Section Two further provides that the House of Representatives may choose its Speaker and its other officers  Though the Constitution does not mandate it  every Speaker has been a member of the House of Representatives  38  The Speaker rarely presides over routine House sessions  choosing instead to deputize a junior member to accomplish the task  Finally  Section Two grants to the House of Representatives the sole power of impeachment  Although the Supreme Court has not had an occasion to interpret this specific provision  the Court has suggested that the grant to the House of the  sole  power of impeachment makes the House the exclusive interpreter of what constitutes an impeachable offense  39  Impeachments are tried in the Senate  as discussed below    edit  Section 3  Senate  edit  Clause 1  Composition  Election of Senators The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State  chosen by the Legislature thereof  for six Years  and each Senator shall have one Vote  Section Three provides that each state is entitled to two Senators chosen for a term of six years  The state legislatures originally chose the means of choosing the Senators  This provision has been superseded in 1913 by the Seventeenth Amendment  which provides for the direct election of Senators by the respective states  voters  Generally  Article Five requires that a proposal to amend the Constitution garner a two thirds majority in both Houses of Congress  and then be ratified by three fourths of the state legislatures  Section Three of Article I is one of a handful of clauses on which Article Five places special restrictions to be amended  in this case  Article Five provides that  no State  without its Consent  shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate   Thus  no individual state may have its representation in the Senate adjusted without its consent unless all other states have an identical change  That is to say  an amendment that changed this clause to provide that all states would get only one Senator  or three Senators  or any other number  could be ratified through the normal process  but an amendment that provided for some basis of representation other than strict numerical equality  for example  population  wealth  or land area  would require the assent of every state   edit  Clause 2  Classification of Senators  Vacancies Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of the first Election  they shall be divided as equally as may be into three Classes  The Seats of the Senators of the first Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year  of the second Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year  and of the third Class at the Expiration of the sixth Year  so that one third may be chosen every second Year  and if Vacancies happen by Resignation  or otherwise  during the Recess of the Legislature of any State  the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature  which shall then fill such Vacancies  After the first group of Senators was elected to the First Congress  1789 1791   the Senators were divide into three  classes  as nearly equal in size as possible  as required by this section  This was done in May 1789 by lot  Those Senators grouped in the first class had their term expire after only two years  those Senators in the second class had their term expire after only four years  instead of six  After this  all Senators from those States have been elected to six year terms  and as new States have joined the Union  their Senate seats have been assigned to one of the three classes  maintaining each grouping as nearly equal in size as possible  In this way  election is staggered  approximately one third of the Senate is up for re election every two years  but the entire body is never up for re election in the same year  as contrasted with the House  where its entire membership is up for re election every 2 years   As originally established  Senators were elected by the Legislature of the State they represented in the Senate  If a senator died  resigned  or was expelled  the legislature of the state would appoint a replacement to serve out the remainder of the senator s term  If the State Legislature was not in session  its Governor could appoint a temporary replacement to serve until the legislature could elect a permanent replacement  This was superseded by the Seventeenth Amendment  which provided for the Popular Election of Senators  instead of their appointment by the State Legislature  In a nod to the less populist nature of the Senate  the Amendment tracks the vacancy procedures for the House of Representatives in requiring that the Governor call a special election to fill the vacancy  but  unlike in the House  it vests in the State Legislature the authority to allow the Governor to appoint a temporary replacement until the special election is held  Note  however  that under the original Constitution  the Governors of the states were expressly allowed by the Constitution to make temporary appointments  The current system  under the Seventeenth Amendment  allows Governors to appoint a replacement only if their state legislature has previously decided to allow the Governor to do so  otherwise  the seat must remain vacant until the special election is held to fill the seat  as in the case of a vacancy in the House   edit  Clause 3  Qualifications of Senators No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years  and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States  and who shall not  when elected  be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen  A Senator must be at least 30 years of age  must have been a citizen of the United States for at least nine years before being elected  and must reside in the State he or she will represent at the time of the election  The Supreme Court has interpreted the Qualifications Clause as an exclusive list of qualifications that cannot be supplemented by a House of Congress exercising its Section  5  authority to  Judge       the       Qualifications of its own Members   26  or by a state in its exercise of its Section  4  authority to prescribe the  Times  Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives          28   edit  Clause 4  Vice President as President of Senate  Voting power The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate  but shall have no Vote  unless they be equally divided  Section Three provides that the Vice President is the President of the Senate  In modern times  the Vice President usually presides over the Senate only when a tie in the voting is anticipated   The following section provides for the President pro tempore of the Senate  a Senator elected to the post by the Senate  to preside in the Absence of the Vice President  or when he shall exercise the Office of the President of the United States  but like the Vice President the President pro tempore  traditionally the longest serving member of the majority party  rarely actually presides over the chamber  typically the President pro tempore deputizes junior Senators of the majority party to act as presiding officers   As a non member of the assembly  the Vice President has only a  casting   tie breaking  vote  This is contrasted with the Speaker of the House  who has always been chosen from the Members of the House of Representatives  38  and as a member of the House is entitled to participate in debate vote on all measures  not just when ties occur  although customarily the speaker votes only rarely  and often to make or break a tie  The tie breaking vote has been cast 243 times by 35 different Vice Presidents  Further information  List of tie breaking votes cast by Vice Presidents of the United States  edit  Clause 5  President pro tempore and other officers The Senate shall chuse  sic  their other Officers  and also a President pro tempore  in the Absence of the Vice President  or when he shall exercise the Office of the President of the United States  The Senate may elect a President pro tempore to act in the Vice President s absence  Although the Constitutional text seems to suggest to the contrary  the Senate s practice has been to elect a full time President pro tempore at the beginning of each Congress  as opposed to making it a temporary office only existing during the Vice President s absence  As is true of the Speaker of the House  38  the Constitution does not require that the President pro tempore be a senator  but by convention  a senator is always chosen  since World War II  the senior member of the majority party has filled this position  40  The President pro tempore  as a member of the Senate  is free to make or break a tie vote like the Speaker of the House  but in the event that the possibility of a tie vote is anticipated the Vice President is routinely on hand to ensure that the Executive Branch s policy preference prevails   edit  Clause 6  Trial of Impeachments The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments  When sitting for that Purpose  they shall be on Oath or Affirmation  When the President of the United States is tried  the Chief Justice shall preside  And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present  The Senate is granted the sole power to try impeachments  just as the House of Lords could try impeachments in Great Britain  The Supreme Court has interpreted the Constitution s provision that the Senate has the  sole  power to try impeachments to mean that the Senate has exclusive and unreviewable authority to determine what constitutes an adequate impeachment trial  41  The senators must sit on oath or affirmation  unlike the lords who voted upon their honor  The Chief Justice presides whenever the President of the United States is tried  to avoid the Vice President exercising his duties as President of the Senate and presiding over the trial of the President of the United States  Although this was probably originally intended to avoid a situation where the Vice President was presiding over a debate that could ultimately result in his promotion to the presidency  were the President convicted and removed from office   it also prevents a possibly more likely contemporary scenario  where a President accused of some offense is being tried by the Senate presided over by a Vice President who may well be sympathetic to the President  reducing the independence of the Senate s consideration of the delicate question of whether to remove a sitting chief executive  On the other hand  nothing prevents the curious circumstance of a Vice President presiding over his own impeachment trial as President of the Senate  should he be impeached  although this has never happened   A two thirds supermajority of those Senators  present  is required to convict  although given the obvious importance of impeachment proceedings  there are generally few absent members  In addition  requiring a two thirds majority of those members  present  has the net effect of making a present member s decision not to cast a vote either way the same as a vote against conviction  42  This is as contrasted with typical practice  where a proposition passes  or not  based on whether it receives the appropriate majority of however many votes were cast  irrespective of how many members were present but chose not to vote  43  However  much as impeachment trials generally have few members absent  the importance of impeachment trials is unlikely to produce many abstentions  i e   non votes  by present members   edit  Clause 7  Judgment in cases of impeachment  Punishment on conviction Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office  and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor  Trust or Profit under the United States  but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment  Trial  Judgment and Punishment  according to Law  If any officer is convicted on impeachment  he or she is immediately removed from office  and may be barred from holding any public office in the future  No other punishments may be inflicted pursuant to the impeachment proceeding  but the convicted party remains liable to trial and punishment in the courts for civil and criminal charges  44   edit  Section 4  Congressional elections  edit  Clause 1  Time  place  and manner of holding The Times  Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives  shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof  but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations  except as to the Places of chusing  sic  Senators  This clause generally commits to the States the authority to determine the  times  places and manner of holding elections   which includes the preliminary stages of the election process  such as a primary election   while reserving to Congress the authority to preempt State regulations with uniform national rules  45  Congress has exercised this authority to determine a uniform date for federal elections  the Tuesday following the first Monday in November  46  Because Congress has not enacted any on point regulations  States still retain the authority to regulate the dates on which other aspects of the election process are held  registration  primary elections  etc   and where elections will be held  As for regulating the  manner  of elections  the Supreme Court has interpreted this to mean  matters like notices  registration  supervision of voting  protection of voters  prevention of fraud and corrupt practices  counting of votes  duties of inspectors and canvassers  and making and publication of election returns   47  The Supreme Court has held that States may not exercise their power to determine the  manner  of holding elections to impose term limits on their congressional delegation  28  One of the most significant ways that States regulate the  manner  of elections is their power to draw election districts  Although in theory Congress could draw the district map for each State  48  it has not exercised this level of oversight  Congress has  however  required the States to conform to certain practices when drawing districts  States are currently required to use a single member district scheme  whereby the State is divided into as many election districts for Representatives in the House of Representatives as the size of its representation in that body  that is to say  Representatives cannot be elected at large from the whole State unless the State has only one Representative in the House  nor can districts elect more than 1 Representative   49  Congress once imposed additional requirements that districts be composed of contiguous territory  be  compact   and have equal populations within each State  50  Congress has allowed those requirements to lapse  51  but the Supreme Court has re imposed the population requirement on the States under the Equal Protection Clause 24  and is suspicious of districts that do not meet the other  traditional  districting criteria of compactness and contiguity  52  The restriction on Congress s inability to  make or alter  regulations pertaining to the places of choosing Senators is largely an anachronism  When State Legislatures selected Senators  if Congress had been able to prescribe the place for choosing Senators  it could have in effect told each State where its state capital must be located  This would have been offensive to the concept of each State being sovereign over its own internal affairs  Now that Senators are popularly elected  it is largely a moot point   edit  Clause 2  Sessions of Congress The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year  and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December  unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day  Clause 2 requires that Congress must assemble at least once each year  This was designed to force Congress to make itself available at least once in a year to provide the legislative action the country needed in the face of the transportation and communication challenges present in the 18th century  In modern practice  Congress is in session virtually year round  Originally  the Constitution provided that the annual meeting was to be on the first Monday in December unless otherwise provided by law  The government under the Articles of Confederation had determined  as a transitional measure to the new constitution  that the date for  commencing proceedings  under the U S  Constitution would be March 4  1789  53  Since the first term of the original federal officials began on this date and ended 2  4  or 6 years later  this became the date on which new federal officials took office in subsequent years  This meant that  every other year  although a new Congress was elected in November  it did not come into office until the following March  with a  lame duck  Congress convening in the interim  As modern communications and travel made it less necessary to wait 4 months from Election Day to the swearing in of the elected officials  it became increasingly cumbersome to elect officials in November but wait until March for them to take office  Congress eventually proposed that elected officials take office in January  instead of March  since this required cutting short  by a couple of months  the terms of the elected federal officials at the time of the proposal  Congress proposed the Twentieth Amendment  which established the present dates for when federal officials take office  While the Constitution always granted Congress the authority to meet on a different day without the need to pass an amendment    2 of the Twentieth Amendment  tidied up  the constitutional text by paralleling the original provision requiring that the Congress meet at least once a year in December  and changing it to January 3  unless changed by law   Although the original Constitution allowed Congress to change its annual meeting date by statute  this change eliminated any reference to a requirement in the Constitution that a lame duck Congress meet in the period between the election of a new Congress and its taking office   edit  Section 5  Procedure  edit  Clause 1  Qualifications of Members Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections  Returns and Qualifications of its own Members  and a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business  but a smaller Number may adjourn from day to day  and may be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members  in such Manner  and under such Penalties as each House may provide  Section Five states that a majority of each House constitutes a quorum to do business  a smaller number may adjourn the House or compel the attendance of absent members  In practice  the quorum requirement is all but ignored  A quorum is assumed to be present unless a quorum call  requested by a member  proves otherwise  Rarely do members ask for quorum calls to demonstrate the absence of a quorum  more often  they use the quorum call as a delaying tactic  Sometimes  unqualified individuals have been admitted to Congress  For instance  the Senate once admitted John Henry Eaton  a twenty eight year old  in 1818  the admission was inadvertent  as Eaton s birth date was unclear at the time   In 1934  a twenty nine year old  Rush Holt  was elected to the Senate  he agreed to wait six months  until his thirtieth birthday  to take the oath  The Senate ruled in that case that the age requirement applied as of the date of the taking of the oath  not the date of election   edit  Clause 2  Rules Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings  punish its Members for disorderly Behavior  and  with the Concurrence of two thirds  expel a member  Each House can determine its own Rules  assuming a quorum is present   and may punish any of its members  A two thirds vote is necessary to expel a member  Section 5  Clause 2 does not provide specific guidance to each House regarding when and how each House may change its rules  leaving details to the respective chambers   edit  Clause 3  Record of proceedings Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings  and from time to time publish the same  excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy  and the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall  at the desire of one fifth of those present  be entered on the Journal  Each House must keep and publish a Journal  though it may choose to keep any part of the Journal secret  The decisions of the House not the words spoken during debates are recorded in the Journal  if one fifth of those present  assuming a quorum is present  request it  the votes of the members on a particular question must also be entered   edit  Clause 4  Adjournment Neither House  during the Session of Congress  shall  without the Consent of the other  adjourn for more than three days  nor to any other Place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting  Neither House may adjourn  without the consent of the other  for more than three days  Often  a House will hold pro forma sessions every three days  such sessions are merely held to fulfill the constitutional requirement  and not to conduct business  Furthermore  neither House may meet in any place other than that designated for both Houses  the Capitol   without the consent of the other House   edit  Section 6  Compensation  privileges  and restrictions on holding civil office  edit  Clause 1  Compensation and legal protection Main article  Speech or Debate Clause The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services  to be ascertained by Law  and paid out of the Treasury of the United States  They shall in all Cases  except Treason  Felony and Breach of the Peace  be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses  and in going to and returning from the same  and for any Speech or Debate in either House  they shall not be questioned in any other Place  Senators and Representatives set their own compensation  Under the Twenty seventh Amendment  any change in their compensation will not take effect until after the next congressional election  Members of both Houses have certain privileges  based on those enjoyed by the members of the British Parliament  Members attending  going to or returning from either House are privileged from arrest  except for treason  felony or breach of the peace  One may not sue a Senator or Representative for slander occurring during Congressional debate  nor may speech by a member of Congress during a Congressional session be the basis for criminal prosecution  The latter was affirmed when Mike Gravel published over 4 000 pages of the Pentagon Papers in the Congressional Record  which might have otherwise been a criminal offense  This clause has also been interpreted in Gravel v  United States  408 U S  606  1972  to provide protection to aides and staff of sitting members of Congress  so long as their activities relate to legislative matters   edit  Clause 2  Independence from the executive Main article  Ineligibility Clause See also  Saxbe fix No Senator or Representative shall  during the Time for which he was elected  be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States  which shall have been created  or the Emoluments whereof shall have been encreased during such time  and no Person holding any Office under the United States  shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office  Senators and Representatives may not simultaneously serve in Congress and hold a position in the executive branch  This restriction is meant to protect legislative independence by preventing the president from using patronage to buy votes in Congress  It is a major difference from the political system in the British Parliament  where cabinet ministers are required to be members of parliament  Furthermore  Senators and Representatives cannot resign to take newly created or higher paying political positions  rather  they must wait until the conclusion of the term for which they were elected  If Congress increases the salary of a particular officer  it may later reduce that salary to permit an individual to resign from Congress and take that position  known as the Saxbe fix   The effects of the clause were discussed in 1937  when Senator Hugo Black was appointed an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court with some time left in his Senate term  Just prior to the appointment  Congress had increased the pension available to Justices retiring at the age of seventy  It was therefore suggested by some that the office s emolument had been increased during Black s Senatorial term  and that therefore Black could not take office as a Justice  The response  however  was that Black was fifty one years old  and would not receive the increased pension until at least 19 years later  long after his Senate term had expired   edit  Section 7  Bills  edit  Clause 1  Bills of revenue All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives  but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills  This establishes the method for making Acts of Congress  Accordingly  any bill may originate in either House of Congress  except for a revenue bill  which may originate only in the House of Representatives  In practice  the Senate can simply circumvent this requirement by substituting the text of any bill previously passed by the House with the text of a revenue bill  54  55  When the Senate sends an appropriation bill to the House  the House may return it to the Senate with a blue slip  thereby settling the question in practice  Either House may amend any bill  including revenue and appropriation bills  The Origination Clause stemmed from an English parliamentary convention that all money bills must have their first reading in the House of Commons  It was intended to ensure that the  power of the purse  lies with the legislative body responsible to the people  The clause was also part of a compromise between small and large states  The latter were unhappy with equal representation in the Senate  56   edit  Clause 2  From bills to law Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate  shall  before it become a Law  be presented to the President of the United States  If he approve he shall sign it  but if not he shall return it  with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated  who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal  and proceed to reconsider it  If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill  it shall be sent  together with the Objections  to the other House  by which it shall likewise be reconsidered  and if approved by two thirds of that House  it shall become a Law  But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays  and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively  If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days  Sundays excepted  after it shall have been presented to him  the Same shall be a Law  in like Manner as if he had signed it  unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return  in which Case it shall not be a Law  This clause is known as the Presentment Clause  Before a bill becomes law  it must be presented to the President  who has ten days  excluding Sundays  to act upon it  If the President signs the bill  it becomes law  If he disapproves of the bill  he must return it to the House in which it originated together with his objections  This procedure has become known as the veto  although that particular word does not appear in the text of Article One  The bill does not then become law unless both Houses  by two thirds votes  override the veto  If the President neither signs nor returns the bill within the ten day limit  the bill becomes law  unless the Congress has adjourned in the meantime  thereby preventing the President from returning the bill to the House in which it originated  In the latter case  the President  by taking no action on the bill towards the end of a session  exercises a  pocket veto   which Congress may not override  In the former case  where the President allows a bill to become law unsigned  there is no common name for the practice  but recent scholarship has termed it a  default enactment   57  What exactly constitutes an adjournment for the purposes of the pocket veto has been unclear  In the Pocket Veto Case  1929   the Supreme Court held that  the determinative question in reference to an  adjournment  is not whether it is a final adjournment of Congress or an interim adjournment  such as an adjournment of the first session  but whether it is one that  prevents  the President from returning the bill to the House in which it originated within the time allowed   Since neither House of Congress was in session  the President could not return the bill to one of them  thereby permitting the use of the pocket veto  In Wright v  United States  1938   however  the Court ruled that adjournments of one House only did not constitute an adjournment of Congress required for a pocket veto  In such cases  the Secretary or Clerk of the House in question was ruled competent to receive the bill   edit  Clause 3  Presidential veto Every Order  Resolution  or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary  except on a question of Adjournment  shall be presented to the President of the United States  and before the Same shall take Effect  shall be approved by him  or being disapproved by him  shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives  according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill  In 1996  Congress passed the Line Item Veto Act  which permitted the President  at the time of the signing of the bill  to rescind certain expenditures  The Congress could disapprove the cancellation and reinstate the funds  The President could veto the disapproval  but the Congress  by a two thirds vote in each House  could override the veto  In the case Clinton v  City of New York  the Supreme Court found the Line Item Veto Act unconstitutional because it violated the Presentment clause  First  the procedure delegated legislative powers to the President  thereby violating the nondelegation doctrine  Second  the procedure violated the terms of Section Seven  which state   if he approve  the bill  he shall sign it  but if not he shall return it   Thus  the President may sign the bill  veto it  or do nothing  but he may not amend the bill and then sign it  Every bill  order  resolution  or vote that must be passed by both Houses  except on a question of adjournment  must be presented to the President before becoming law  However  to propose a constitutional amendment  two thirds of both Houses may submit it to the states for the ratification  without any consideration by the President  as prescribed in Article V  Some Presidents have made very extensive use of the veto  while others have not used it at all  Grover Cleveland  for instance  vetoed over four hundred bills during his first term in office  Congress overrode only two of those vetoes  Meanwhile  seven Presidents have never used the veto power  There have been 2 560 vetoes  including pocket vetoes  58   edit  Section 8  Powers of Congress  edit  Enumerated powers Main article  Enumerated powers Congress s powers are enumerated in Section Eight  The Congress shall have power To lay and collect Taxes  Duties  Imposts and Excises  to pay the Debts and provide for the common defence note 1 and general Welfare of the United States  but all Duties  Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States  To borrow Money on the credit of the United States  To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations  and among the several States  and with the Indian Tribes  To establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization  and uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States  To coin Money  regulate the Value thereof  and of foreign Coin  and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures  To provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and current coin of the United States  To establish Post Offices and post Roads  To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts  by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries  To constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court  To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas  and Offenses against the Law of Nations  To declare War  grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal  and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water  To raise and support Armies  but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years  To provide and maintain a Navy  To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces  To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union  suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions  To provide for organizing  arming  and disciplining  the Militia  and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States  reserving to the States respectively  the Appointment of the Officers  and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress  To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever  over such District  not exceeding ten Miles square  as may  by Cession of particular States  and the Acceptance of Congress  become the Seat of the Government of the United States  and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be  for the Erection of Forts  Magazines  Arsenals  dock Yards  and other needful Buildings  And To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers  and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States  or in any Department or Officer thereof  Many powers of Congress have been interpreted broadly  Most notably  the Taxing and Spending  Interstate Commerce  and Necessary and Proper Clauses have been deemed to grant expansive powers to Congress  Congress may lay and collect taxes for the  common defense  or  general welfare  of the United States  The U S  Supreme Court has not often defined  general welfare   leaving the political question to Congress  In United States v  Butler  1936   the Court for the first time construed the clause  The dispute centered on a tax collected from processors of agricultural products such as meat  the funds raised by the tax were not paid into the general funds of the treasury  but were rather specially earmarked for farmers  The Court struck down the tax  ruling that the general welfare language in the Taxing and Spending Clause related only to  matters of national  as distinguished from local  welfare   Congress continues to make expansive use of the Taxing and Spending Clause  for instance  the social security program is authorized under the Taxing and Spending Clause  Congress is permitted to borrow money on the credit of the United States  In 1871  when deciding Knox v  Lee  the Court ruled that this clause permitted Congress to emit bills and make them legal tender in satisfaction of debts  Whenever Congress borrows money  it is obligated to repay the sum as stipulated in the original agreement  However  such agreements are only  binding on the conscience of the sovereign   as the doctrine of sovereign immunity prevents a creditor from suing in court if the government reneges its commitment  59   edit  Commerce Clause Main article  Commerce Clause The Congress shall have Power       To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations  and among the several States  and with the Indian Tribes  The Supreme Court has seldom restrained the use of the commerce clause for widely varying purposes  The first important decision related to the commerce clause was Gibbons v  Ogden  decided by a unanimous Court in 1824  The case involved conflicting federal and state laws  Thomas Gibbons had a federal permit to navigate steamboats in the Hudson River  while the other  Aaron Ogden  had a monopoly to do the same granted by the state of New York  Ogden contended that  commerce  included only buying and selling of goods and not their transportation  Chief Justice John Marshall rejected this notion  Marshall suggested that  commerce  included navigation of goods  and that it  must have been contemplated  by the Framers  Marshall added that Congress s power over commerce  is complete in itself  may be exercised to its utmost extent  and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution   Chief Justice John Marshall established a broad interpretation of the Commerce Clause  The expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause was restrained during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries  when a laissez faire attitude dominated the Court  In United States v  E  C  Knight Company  1895   the Supreme Court limited the newly enacted Sherman Antitrust Act  which had sought to break up the monopolies dominating the nation s economy  The Court ruled that Congress could not regulate the manufacture of goods  even if they were later shipped to other states  Chief Justice Melville Fuller wrote   commerce succeeds to manufacture  and is not a part of it   The U S  Supreme Court sometimes ruled New Deal programs unconstitutional because they stretched the meaning of the commerce clause  In Schechter Poultry Corp  v  United States   1935  the Court unanimously struck down industrial codes regulating the slaughter of poultry  declaring that Congress could not regulate commerce relating to the poultry  which had  come to a permanent rest within the State   As Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes put it   so far as the poultry here in question is concerned  the flow of interstate commerce has ceased   Judicial rulings against attempted use of Congress s Commerce Clause powers continued during the 1930s  It was only in 1937 that the Supreme Court gave up the laissez faire doctrine as it decided a landmark case  National Labor Relations Board v  Jones  amp  Laughlin Steel Company  The legislation in question  the National Labor Relations Act  prevented employers from engaging in  unfair labor practices  such as firing workers for joining unions  The Court ruled to sustain the Act s provisions  The Court  returning to the theories propounded by John Marshall  ruled that Congress could pass laws regulating actions that even indirectly influenced interstate commerce  Further decisions expanded the Congress s powers under the commerce clause  This dramatic change in the Court s thinking was influenced by the threat of President Franklin D  Roosevelt s Court Packing scheme  In the 1990s  the Court acted to restrain Congress s exercise of its power to regulate commerce  In United States v  Lopez  the Court found that Congress could not exercise  Police power  reserved to the States by use of the Commerce Clause  In contrast to United States v  Lopez   the powers defined in the Commerce Clause have been elastically re interpreted to cover non commercial activity not just between but within the states  In 2005  the Supreme Court controversially ruled in Gonzales v  Raich  that the Commerce Clause granted Congress the authority to regulate Cannabis plants grown  processed  and consumed within the state on private property  The court reclassified the plant as a commodity even though it was not sold or exchanged in any transaction   edit  Other powers of Congress Congress may establish uniform laws relating to naturalization and bankruptcy  It may also coin money  regulate the value of American or foreign currency and punish counterfeiters  Congress may fix the standards of weights and measures  Furthermore  Congress may establish post offices and post roads  the roads  however  need not be exclusively for the conveyance of mail   Congress may promote the progress of science and useful arts by granting copyrights and patents of limited duration  Section eight  clause eight of Article One  known as the Copyright Clause  is the only instance of the word  right  used in the original constitution  though the word does appear in several Amendments   60  Though perpetual copyrights and patents are prohibited  the Supreme Court has ruled in Eldred v  Ashcroft  2003  that repeated extensions to the term of copyright do not constitute perpetual copyright  also note that this is the only power granted where the means to accomplish its stated purpose is specifically provided for  Courts inferior to the Supreme Court may be established by Congress  Congress has several powers related to war and the armed forces  Under the War Powers Clause  only Congress may declare war  but in several cases it has  without declaring war  granted the President the authority to engage in military conflicts  Five wars have been declared in American history  the War of 1812  the Mexican American War  the Spanish American War  World War I and World War II  Some historians argue that the legal doctrines and legislation passed during the operations against Pancho Villa constitute a sixth declaration of war  Congress may grant letters of marque and reprisal  Congress may establish and support the armed forces  but no appropriation made for the support of the army may be used for more than two years  This provision was inserted because the Framers feared the establishment of a standing army  beyond civilian control  during peacetime  Congress may regulate or call forth the state militias  but the states retain the authority to appoint officers and train personnel  Congress also has exclusive power to make rules and regulations governing the land and naval forces  Although the executive branch and the Pentagon have asserted an ever increasing measure of involvement in this process  the U S  Supreme Court has often reaffirmed Congress s exclusive hold on this power  e g  Burns v  Wilson  346 U S  137  1953    Congress used this power twice soon after World War II with the enactment of two statutes  the Uniform Code of Military Justice to improve the quality and fairness of courts martial and military justice  and the Federal Tort Claims Act which among other rights had allowed military service persons to sue for damages until the U S  Supreme Court repealed that section of the statute in a divisive series of cases  known collectively as the Feres Doctrine  Congress has the exclusive right to legislate  in all cases whatsoever  for the nation s capital  the District of Columbia  Congress chooses to devolve some of such authority to the elected mayor and council of District of Columbia  Nevertheless  Congress remains free to enact any legislation for the District so long as constitutionally permissible  to overturn any legislation by the city government  and technically to revoke the city government at any time  Congress may also exercise such jurisdiction over land purchased from the states for the erection of forts and other buildings   edit  Necessary and Proper clause Main article  Necessary and Proper Clause The Congress shall have Power       To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers  and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States  or in any Department or Officer thereof  Finally  Congress has the power to do whatever is  necessary and proper  to carry out its enumerated powers and  crucially  all others vested in it  This has been interpreted to authorize criminal prosecution of those whose actions have a  substantial effect  on interstate commerce in Wickard v  Filburn   however  Thomas Jefferson  in the Kentucky Resolutions  supported by James Madison  maintained that a penal power could not be inferred from a power to regulate  and that the only penal powers were for treason  counterfeiting  piracy and felony on the high seas  and offenses against the law of nations  The necessary and proper clause has been interpreted extremely broadly  thereby giving Congress wide latitude in legislation  The first landmark case involving the clause was McCulloch v  Maryland  1819   which involved the establishment of a national bank  Alexander Hamilton  in advocating the creation of the bank  argued that there was  a more or less direct  relationship between the bank and  the powers of collecting taxes  borrowing money  regulating trade between the states  and raising and maintaining fleets and navies   Thomas Jefferson countered that Congress s powers  can all be carried into execution without a national bank  A bank therefore is not necessary  and consequently not authorized by this phrase   Chief Justice John Marshall agreed with the former interpretation  Marshall wrote that a Constitution listing all of Congress s powers  would partake of a prolixity of a legal code and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind   Since the Constitution could not possibly enumerate the  minor ingredients  of the powers of Congress  Marshall  deduced  that Congress had the authority to establish a bank from the  great outlines  of the general welfare  commerce and other clauses  Under this doctrine of the necessary and proper clause  Congress has sweepingly broad powers  known as implied powers  not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution  However  the Congress cannot enact laws solely on the implied powers  any action must be necessary and proper in the execution of the enumerated powers   edit  Section 9  Limits on Congress The next section of Article One provided limits on Congress s powers  The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit  shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight  but a Tax or duty may be imposed on such Importation  not exceeding ten dollars for each Person  The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended  unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it  No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed  No Capitation  or other direct  Tax shall be laid  unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken  61  No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State  No Preference shall be given by any Regulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of another  nor shall Vessels bound to  or from  one State  be obliged to enter  clear  or pay Duties in another  No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury  but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law  and a regular Statement and Account of Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time  No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States  And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them  shall  without the Consent of the Congress  accept of any present  Emolument  Office  or Title  of any kind whatever  from any King  Prince  or foreign State  Although the international slave trade was allowed until 1808  Congress prohibited it on January 1  1808  the first day it was permitted to do so  Until 1808  however  the Constitution permitted Congress to levy a maximum duty of ten dollars per slave imported into the United States  A writ of habeas corpus is a legal action against unlawful detainment that commands a law enforcement agency or other body that has a person in custody to have a court inquire into the legality of the detention  The court may order the person released if the reason for detention is deemed insufficient or unjustifiable  The Constitution further provides that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus may not be suspended  unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it   In Ex parte Milligan  1866   the Supreme Court decided that the suspension of habeas corpus was lawful  but military tribunals did not apply to citizens in states that had upheld the authority of the Constitution and where civilian courts were still operating  A bill of attainder is a law by which a person is immediately convicted without trial  An ex post facto law is a law which applies retroactively  punishing someone for an act that was only made criminal after it was done  The ex post facto clause does not apply to civil matters  62  Section Nine reiterates the provision from Section Two that direct taxes must be apportioned by state populations  Furthermore  no tax may be imposed on exports from any state  Congress may not  by revenue or commerce legislation  give preference to ports of one state over those of another  neither may it require ships from one state to pay duties in another  All funds belonging to the Treasury may not be withdrawn except according to law  Modern practice is that Congress annually passes a number of appropriation bills authorizing the expenditure of public money  The Constitution requires that a regular statement of such expenditures be published  The Title of Nobility Clause prohibits Congress from granting any title of nobility  In addition  it specifies that no civil officer may accept  without the consent of Congress  any gift  payment  office or title from a foreign ruler or state  However  a U S  citizen may receive foreign office before or after their period of public service   edit  Section 10  Limits on the States  edit  Clause 1  Contracts Clause Main article  Contract Clause No State shall enter into any Treaty  Alliance  or Confederation  grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal  coin Money  emit Bills of Credit  make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts  pass any Bill of Attainder  ex post facto Law  or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts  or grant any Title of Nobility  States may not exercise certain powers reserved for the federal government  they may not enter into treaties  alliances or confederations  grant letters of marque or reprisal  coin money or issue bills of credit  such as currency   Furthermore  no state may make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts  which expressly forbids any state government  but not the federal government 63   from  making a tender   i e   authorizing something that may be offered in payment 64   of any type or form of money to meet any financial obligation  65  unless that form of money is coins made of gold or silver  or a medium of exchange backed by and redeemable in gold or silver coins  as noted in Farmers  amp  Merchants Bank v  Federal Reserve Bank 66    Much of this clause is devoted to preventing the States from using or creating any currency other than that created by Congress  In Federalist no  44  Madison explains that      it may be observed that the same reasons which shew the necessity of denying to the States the power of regulating coin  prove with equal force that they ought not to be at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin  Had every State a right to regulate the value of its coin  there might be as many different currencies as States  and thus the intercourse among them would be impeded   67  Moreover  the states may not pass bills of attainder  ex post facto laws  impair the obligation of contracts or grant titles of nobility  The Contract Clause was the subject of much contentious litigation in the 19th century  It was first interpreted by the Supreme Court in 1810  when Fletcher v  Peck was decided  The case involved the Yazoo land scandal  in which the Georgia legislature authorized the sale of land to speculators at low prices  The bribery involved in the passage of the authorizing legislation was so blatant that a Georgia mob attempted to lynch the corrupt members of the legislature  Following elections  the legislature passed a law that rescinded the contracts granted by the corrupt legislators  The validity of the annulment of the sale was questioned in the Supreme Court  In writing for a unanimous court  Chief Justice John Marshall asked   What is a contract   His answer was   a compact between two or more parties   Marshall argued that the sale of land by the Georgia legislature  though fraught with corruption  was a valid  contract   He added that the state had no right to annul the purchase of the land  since doing so would impair the obligations of contract  The definition of a contract propounded by Chief Justice Marshall was not as simple as it may seem  In 1819  the Court considered whether a corporate charter could be construed as a contract  The case of Trustees of Dartmouth College v  Woodward involved Dartmouth College  which had been established under a Royal Charter granted by King George III  The Charter created a board of twelve trustees for the governance of the College  In 1815  however  New Hampshire passed a law increasing the board s membership to twenty one with the aim that public control could be exercised over the College  The Court  including Marshall  ruled that New Hampshire could not amend the charter  which was ruled to be a contract since it conferred  vested rights  on the trustees  The Marshall Court determined another dispute in Sturges v  Crowninshield  The case involved a debt that was contracted in early 1811  Later in that year  the state of New York passed a bankruptcy law  under which the debt was later discharged  The Supreme Court ruled that a retroactively applied state bankruptcy law impaired the obligation to pay the debt  and therefore violated the Constitution  In Ogden v  Saunders  1827   however  the court decided that state bankruptcy laws could apply to debts contracted after the passage of the law  State legislation on the issue of bankruptcy and debtor relief has not been much of an issue since the adoption of a comprehensive federal bankruptcy law in 1898   edit  Clause 2  Export Clause No State shall  without the Consent of the Congress  lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports  except what may be absolutely necessary for executing it s  sic  inspection Laws  and the net Produce of all Duties and Imposts  laid by any State on Imports or Exports  shall be for the Use of the Treasury of the United States  and all such Laws shall be subject to the Revision and Controul of the Congress  Still more powers are prohibited of the states  States may not  without the consent of Congress  tax imports or exports except for the fulfillment of state inspection laws  which may be revised by Congress   The net revenue of the tax is paid not to the state  but to the federal Treasury   edit  Clause 3  Compact Clause No State shall  without the Consent of Congress  lay any Duty of Tonnage  keep Troops  or Ships of War in time of Peace  enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State  or with a foreign Power  or engage in War  unless actually invaded  or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay  Under the Compact Clause  states may not  without the consent of Congress  keep troops or armies during times of peace  They may not enter into alliances nor compacts with foreign states  nor engage in war unless invaded  States may  however  organize and arm a militia  Currently the National Guard and State Militias with federal oversight fulfill this function  The idea of allowing Congress to have say over agreements between states traces back to the numerous controversies that arose between various colonies  Eventually compromises would be created between the two colonies and these compromises would be submitted to the Crown for approval  After the American Revolutionary War  the Articles of Confederation allowed states to appeal to Congress to settle disputes between the states over boundaries or  any cause whatever   The Articles of Confederation also required Congressional approval for  any treaty or alliance  in which a state was one of the parties  There have been a number of Supreme Court cases  especially Virginia v  Tennessee  148 U S  503  1893   concerning what constitutes valid congressional consent to an interstate compact  The Court found that some agreements among states stand even without Congress  consent  According to the Court  the Compact Clause requires congressional consent only if the agreement among the states is  directed to the formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the States  which may encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States   68   edit  Notes   In the hand written engrossed copy of the

third is the judicial  and the rule is that in the actual administration of the government Congress       should exercise the legislative power  the President       the executive power  and the courts or the judiciary the judicial power              See United States v  Lopez  514 U S  549  592  1995     Certain  comments of Hamilton and others about federal power reflected the well known truth that the new Government would have only the limited and enumerated powers found in the Constitution        Even before the passage of the Tenth Amendment  it was apparent that Congress would possess only those powers  herein granted  by the rest of the Constitution       Compare id  with Myers v  United States  272 U S  52  128  1926    The difference between the grant of legislative power under article 1 to Congress which is limited to powers therein enumerated  and the more general grant of the executive power to the President under article 2 is significant  The fact that the executive power is given in general terms strengthened by specific terms where emphasis is appropriate  and limited by direct expressions where limitation is needed  and that no express limit is placed on the power of removal by the executive is a convincing indication that none was intended    and Kansas v  Colorado  206 U S  46  82  1907     I n article 3  which treats of the judicial department  and this is important for our present consideration           1 reads that  the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court             By this is granted the entire judicial power of the nation        There may be  of course  limitations on that grant of power  but  if there are any  they must be expressed  for otherwise the general grant would vest in the courts all the judicial power which the new nation was capable of exercising       See Touby v  United States  500 U S  160  165  1991    From th e language of this section of the Constitution  the Court has derived

In effect  the nondelegation doctrine as a principle of statutory interpretation is used by the courts to  require a clear statement by Congress that it intended to test the constitutional waters     cf  Edward J  DeBartolo Corp  v  Fla  Gulf Coast Bldg   amp  Constr  Trades Council  485 U S  568  575  1988     W here an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems  the Court will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress        This approach not only reflects the prudential concern that constitutional issues not be needlessly confronted  but also recognizes that Congress  like this Court  is bound by and swears an oath to uphold the Constitution  The courts will therefore not lightly assume that Congress intended to infringe constitutionally protected liberties or usurp power constitutionally forbidden it    citing NLRB v  Catholic Bishop  440 U S  490

over the whole range of the national interests concerning which Congress might legislate or decide upon due investigation not to legislate  it has similarly been utilized in determining what to appropriate from the national purse  or whether to appropriate     e g   3 Annals of Congress 490 94  1792   House committee appointed to investigate the defeat of Gen  St  Clair by Indians empowered

enforce it is an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative function  It was so regarded and employed in American Legislatures before the Constitution was framed and ratified        A legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change  and where the legislative body does not itself possess the requisite information which not infrequently is true recourse must be had to others who do possess it  Experience has taught that mere requests for such information often are unavailing  and also that information which is volunteered is not always accurate or complete  so some means of compulsion are essential to obtain what is needed  All this was true before and when the Constitution was framed and adopted  In that period the power of inquiry  with enforcing process  was regarded and employed as a necessary and appropriate attribute of the power to legislate indeed  was treated as inhering in it  Thus there is ample warrant for thinking       that the constitutional provisions which commit the legislative function to the two houses are intended to include this attribute to the end that the function may be effectively exercised       a b See Watkins v  United States  354 U S  178  187  1957    The power of the Congress to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process  That power is broad  It encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes  It includes surveys of defects in our social  economic or political system for the purpose of enabling the Congress to remedy them  It comprehends probes into departments of the Federal Government to expose corruption

rightfully may take other action   and  if the inquiry relates to  a matter wherein relief or redress could be had only by a judicial proceeding  it is not within the range of this power  but must be

that as nearly as is practicable one man s vote in a congressional election is to be worth as much as another s        The history of the Constitution       reveals that those who framed the Constitution meant that       it was population which was to be the basis of the House of Representatives        It would defeat the principle solemnly embodied in the Great Compromise equal representation in the House for equal numbers of people for us to hold that  within the States  legislatures may draw the lines of congressional districts in such a way as to give some voters a

Pennsylvania  41 U S   16 Pet   539  619  1842   dictum     Congress  has  on various occasions  exercised powers which were necessary and proper as means to carry into effect rights expressly given  and duties expressly enjoined thereby  The end being required  it has been deemed a just and necessary implication  that the means to accomplish it are given also  or  in other words  that the power flows as a necessary means to accomplish the end  Thus  for example  although the constitution has declared  that representatives shall be apportioned among the states according to their respective federal numbers  and for this purpose  it has expressly authorized congress  by law  to provide for an enumeration of the population every ten years  yet the power to apportion representatives  after this enumeration is made  is nowhere found among the express powers given to congress  but it has always been acted upon  as irresistibly flowing from the duty positively enjoined by the constitution       See Whelan v  Cuomo  415 F  Supp  251  256  E D N Y  1976    The historical record of the Constitutional Convention supports several conclusions           including that  Congress was given considerable flexibility in determining the actual number of representatives so long as the total did not exceed one representative for every 30 000 inhabitants       See 3 Annals of Cong  539  1792   President Washington s veto of apportionment legislation that would not have exceeded a national average of 1 for every 30 000 inhabitants  but did exceed that ratio for some states   see also U S  Dep t of Commerce v  Montana  Montana II   503 U S  442  449 50  Congress s response to Washington s veto was enacting legislation providing for 1 representative per 33 000 of the national population

Montana  also with 1 representative  had a population at the time of the last reapportionment of 902 195  this is because districts cannot cross state lines  and the formula Congress has prescribed distributed representatives in other ways  in fact  the Montana litigation was the State of Montana s challenge to the formula Congress has chosen   Districts are only equalized as near as possible as compared to other districts within a particular state  For example  under the most recent apportionment California has 53 districts  and all 53 of them must have the same population  but as long as the size of the House is fixed at any particular number it is impossible to ensure that the 53 California districts will each have the same population as the districts in any other State  See Montana II  503 U S  at 463   The constitutional guarantee of a minimum of one Representative for each State inexorably compels a significant departure from the ideal         T he need to allocate a fixed

Elections Clause grants Congress  the power to override state regulations  by establishing uniform rules for federal elections  binding on the States    T he regulations made by Congress are paramount to those made by the State legislature  and if they conflict therewith  the latter  so far as the conflict extends  ceases to be operative   The Clause gives Congress  comprehensive  authority to regulate the details of elections  including the power to impose  the numerous requirements as to procedure and safeguards which experience shows are necessary in order to enforce the fundamental right involved   Congressional authority extends not only to general elections  but also to any  primary election which involves a necessary step in the choice of candidates for election as representatives in Congress     citations omitted   United States v  Manning  215 F  Supp  272  284  W D  La  1963      T he manner of holding elections        must be read as referring to the entire
