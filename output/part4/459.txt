History Main article  History of Palau The archipelago is also known as  The Black Islands   Vintage maps and village drawings  as well as photos of the tattooed and pierced Ibedul of Koror and Lundee  can be found at the Australian Library Online listed in the external links section of this article  Palau was initially settled over 3 000 years ago  and perhaps 4 500 years ago  probably by migrants from the Philippines  A negrito population is attested until about 900 years ago  The modern population  judging by its language  may have come from the Sunda Islands  British traders became prominent visitors in the 18th century  followed by expanding Spanish influence in the 19th century  Following its defeat in the Spanish American War  Spain sold Palau and most of the rest of the Caroline Islands to Germany in 1899  Control passed to Japan in 1914 and during World War II the islands were taken by the United States in 1944  with the costly Battle of Peleliu between September 15 and November 25 when more than 2 000 Americans and 10 000 Japanese were killed  The islands passed formally to the United States under United Nations auspices in 1947 as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands  Four of the Trust Territory districts formed a single federated Micronesian state in 1979  but the districts of Palau and the Marshall Islands declined to participate  Palau  the westernmost cluster of the Caroline Islands  instead opted for independent status in 1978  approved a new constitution and became the Republic of Palau in 1981  5  and signed a Compact of Free Association with the United States in 1982  After eight referendums and an amendment to the Palauan constitution  the Compact was ratified in 1993  The Compact went into effect on October 1  1994  6  marking Palau de jure independent  although it had been de facto independent since May 25  1994  when the trusteeship was cancelled   Legislation making Palau an  offshore  financial center was passed by the Senate in 1998  In 2001  Palau passed its first bank regulation and anti money laundering laws   edit  Politics and government Main article  Politics of Palau Palau s politics takes place in a multi party framework of a presidential representative democratic republic  whereby the President of Palau is both head of state and head of government  Executive power is exercised by the government  while legislative power is vested in both the government and the Palau National Congress  The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature  Palau adopted its own constitution in 1981  and the governments of the United States and Palau concluded a Compact of Free Association in 1986  similar to compacts that the United States had entered into with the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands  7  The compact entered into force on October 1  1994  concluding Palau s transition from trusteeship to independence 7  as the last portion of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands to gain its independence   edit  Free association Main article  Compact of Free Association The Compact of Free Association between the United States and Palau 8  sets forth the free and voluntary association of their Governments  and is primarily focused on the issues of government relations  economic relations  and security and defense relations  9  Palau has no independent military  and relies on the United States for its defense  Under the Compact  the American military has been granted access to the islands for 50 years  The role of the US Navy is quite minimal  limited to a handful of Navy Seabees  construction engineers  but the United States Coast Guard does have a stronger presence in patrolling the waters   edit  Foreign relations As a sovereign nation  Palau conducts its own foreign relations  7  Since independence  Palau has established diplomatic relations with a number of nations  including many of its Pacific neighbors  Palau was admitted to the United Nations on December 15  1994  and has since joined several other international organizations  In September 2006  Palau hosted the first Taiwan Pacific Allies Summit  and its President has gone on several official visits to other Pacific countries  including the Republic of China  Taiwan   The United States maintains the usual diplomatic delegation and an embassy in Palau  but most aspects of the two countries  relationship have to do with Compact funded projects  which are the responsibility of the U S  Department of the Interior s Office of Insular Affairs  10  This has led to some ambiguity in the official status of Palau  citation needed  though regarded as de jure independent  Since 2004  Palau has joined the United States and Israel as the only nations voting consistently against an annual U N  resolution condemning the United States embargo against Cuba which has been in place since 1962  On October 5  2009 Palau formalized Diplomatic and Trade Ties with Malaysia and Lord Morris Davidson was appointed as Palau s first Honorary Consul to Malaysia  Palau is a member of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement  11   edit  Nuclear free constitution In 1981  Palau voted for the world s first nuclear free constitution  This constitution banned the use  storage  and disposal of nuclear  toxic chemical  gas  and biological weapons without first being approved by a 3 4 majority in a referendum  12  This ban held up Palau s transition to independence because while negotiating a Compact of Free Association with the United States  the U S  insisted on the option to operate nuclear propelled vessels and store nuclear weapons within the territory  13  After several referendums that failed to achieve a 3 4 majority  the people of Palau finally approved the compact with the U S  in 1994  14  15   edit  Asylum for former Guantanamo prisoners See also  Uyghur captives in Guantanamo On June 10  2009  Palau announced that it would accept up to all 17 of the remaining Uyghurs detained in Guantanamo  as a humanitarian gesture   16  17  18  19  20  21  Five Uyghur captives were released without being prosecuted in 2004  and transferred to Albania in 2006  The remaining seventeen were released due to lack of evidence in 2008  Stuart Beck  Palau s representative to the United Nations  published an op ed in the New York Times disputing the widely distributed report that Palau s agreement to accept the Uyghurs was tied to Palau s receipt of US 200 million in foreign aid  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  Beck asserted that Palau was receiving funds from the USA connected with accepting the Uyghurs  but it was  90 000 per Uyghur  not   12 million   Beck asserted that the  90 000 was to compensate Palau for its  relocation costs  and was  to cover transportation  food  housing and medical help until the men can get oriented and get jobs   ABC News confirmed that the United States would be paying Palau for each captive who was resettled and quoted a senior official who described the amount as  not very substantial   23  William Cleary  writing in the Pacific Daily News  reported that Palau was in a poor bargaining position to decline the American request  24  He wrote   The detainee transfer deal comes at a time when generous U S  financial aid and economic development grants to Palau under a 15 year old treaty of free association between the two nations have expired  Palauan leaders apparently wanted to demonstrate their commitment to sharing mutual interests and burdens with the USA  as they make the case for renewal of U S  grant assistance   However  Cleary also described the assertions that the captive resettlement was a straight quid pro quo as  misleading   24  He listed the USA s desire to continue to be able to base DoD personnel on Palau  to balance the growing military force of the People s Republic of China as one complicating factor  He also listed Palau s desire to have exemption from growing pressure within the United States to restrict immigration from former protectorates like Palau as another complicating factor  An official  technical working group  from Palau traveled to Guantanamo to meet with the Uyghurs in mid June 2009  25  26  On June 23  the Palau government published a press release which said only eight of the thirteen Uyghurs agreed to meet with the delegation  Their report stated   The team advised President Toribiong that in their opinion only a few of the detainees that were interviewed had any real interest in being relocated to Palau   On June 30  Radio New Zealand International reported only one Uyghur agreed to be temporarily resettled in Palau  27  On September 10  The Times reported that three of the Uyghurs  have accepted the invitation to be transferred to asylum in Palau  28  On September 19  Fox News reported that in the week since the first announcement three further Uyghurs agreed to be transferred to Palau  29  Fox reported that five of the other Uyghurs had refused to speak with Palau officials  On October 31  six Uyghurs were reported to have been transferred to Palau  30  31  32  33  34  Twelve of the thirteen remaining Uyghurs were offered asylum  The thirteenth man was not offered asylum because his mental health had deteriorated too severely for the mental health resources available in Palau  The USA agreed to give Palau additional aid in January 2010  35  Palau had rejected an earlier aid package of  156 million  The new aid package was for  250 million  President Toribiong asserted that the increase in aid was unrelated to Palau agreement to host the Uyghurs   edit  States The sixteen states of Palau  Main article  States of Palau Palau is divided into sixteen states  until 1984

Babeldaob  Koror  and Peleliu  The latter three lie together within the same barrier reef  while Angaur is an oceanic island several miles to the south  About two thirds of the population live on Koror  The coral atoll of Kayangel is situated north of these islands  while the uninhabited Rock Islands  about 200  are situated to the west of the main island group  A remote group of six islands  known as the Southwest Islands  some 375 miles  604 km  from the main islands  are also part of the country and make up the states of Hatohobei and Sonsorol  Palau has a tropical climate all year

environmental degradation  there are several areas of concern  including illegal fishing with the use of dynamite  inadequate facilities for disposal of solid waste in Koror  and extensive sand and coral dredging in the Palau lagoon  Like the other Pacific island nations  a potential major environmental threat is rising sea levels  Water coverage of low lying areas is a threat to coastal vegetation  agriculture  and the purity of the nation s water supply  Palau also has a problem with inadequate water supply and limited agricultural areas to support the size of the population  The nation is also vulnerable to earthquakes  volcanic activity  and tropical storms  Sewage treatment is a problem  along with the handling of toxic waste from fertilizers and biocides  On November 5  2005  President of Palau  Tommy E  Remengesau  Jr  took the lead on a regional environmental initiative called the Micronesia challenge  which would conserve 30  of near shore coastal waters and 20  of forest land by 2020  In addition to Palau  the initiative was joined by the Federated States of Micronesia and Marshall Islands  and the U S  territories of Guam and Northern Mariana Islands  Together  this combined region represents nearly 5  of the marine area of the Pacific Ocean and 7  of its coastlines  On September 25  2009  Palau announced that it would create the world s first  shark sanctuary   37  Palau has banned all commercial shark fishing within its EEZ waters  The sanctuary protects about 600 000 square kilometres  230 000 sq mi  of ocean  38  a similar size to the European country of France  39  40  41 President Johnson Toribiong made the announcement at a meeting of the United Nations  39  42  43  President Toribiong also requested a worldwide ban on fishing for sharks  39  Saltwater crocodiles are also residents of Palau and occur in varying numbers throughout the various mangroves and even in parts of the beautiful rock islands  Although this species is generally considered extremely dangerous  there has only been one fatal human attack in Palau within modern history  and that was in the 1960s  In Palau the largest crocodile measured in at 4 5 metres  15 ft   citation needed   edit  Economy Koror Babeldaob Bridge  Main article  Economy of Palau Palau s economy consists primarily of tourism  subsistence agriculture  and fishing  Tourist activity focuses on scuba diving and snorkeling in the islands  rich marine environment  including its barrier reefs walls and World War II wrecks  The government is the major employer of the work force  relying heavily on financial assistance from the US  Business and tourist arrivals numbered 50 000 in the financial year 2000 2001  The population enjoys a per capita income twice that of Micronesia  Long term prospects for the key tourist sector have been greatly bolstered by the expansion of air travel in the Pacific  the rising prosperity of leading East Asian countries  and the willingness of foreigners to finance infrastructure development  In July 2004  Palau Micronesia Air was launched with service from Palau to Yap  Guam  Micronesia  Saipan  Australia  and the Philippines  By offering low fares it was planned to be a competitor of Continental Micronesia  however it ceased operations in December of the same year  mainly because of rising fuel prices  Palau Micronesia Air has not restarted operations since but has made a codeshare alliance with Asian Spirit  a carrier that operated flights between Palau and the Philippines  Davao  Cebu  and Manila   There were two flights weekly from Manila via Cebu to Palau and one flight weekly from Davao  Just after few months of service  Asian Spirit ceased its Philippines to Palau route  In March 2010  Pacific Flier began providing air services to Clark  Gold Coast and Guam  however  Pacific Flier suspended operations shortly after  in August 2010  44  In November 2006  the Palau Saving Bank officially announced bankruptcy  On December 13 of the same year the Palau Horizon reported that there were a total of 641 depositors that had been affected by the event  Among the 641 accounts  398 held less than  5000 USD  with the remainder ranging from  5000 to 2 million USD  On December 12  79 of the affected people received compensation  one was Taiwanese  while the rest were Palauan  Filipino and US citizens  Mr  Toribiong said   The fund for the payout came from the balance of Palau government s loan from Taiwan   From a total of  1 million USD  which originally was for assisting Palau s development  there was  955 000 USD left at the time of bankruptcy  For the  955 000  Toribiong requested the Taiwanese government use it to repay its loans  Taiwan agreed to the request  The compensation will start its paying to depositor  who held less than  4 000 USD in the account  45  Taxes are moderate  the income tax has 3 brackets with medium rates  9 3   15  and 19 6    corporate tax is 4  and

1990 15 122 2000 21 000 The population of Palau is approximately 21 000  of whom 70  are native Palauans  who are of mixed Melanesian  Micronesian  and Austronesian descent  Many Palauans also have some Asian ancestry  which is the result of intermarriage between settlers and Palauans between the 19th and 20th centuries  Palauans with mixed Japanese ancestry accounted for the largest group  and some also had some Chinese or Korean ancestry  Filipinos form the second largest ethnic group  The official languages of Palau are Palauan and English  except for two states  Sonsorol and Hatohobei  where the local language  along with Palauan  is official  Japanese is also spoken widely amongst older Palauans  and is an official language in the State of Angaur  46  47 Tagalog is not official in

This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Palauan society  much like the island s language  has always been one unique to the island and its people  A very noticeable aspect of Palauan society is that it follows a very strict matrilineal system  Matrilineal practices are seen in nearly every aspect of Palauan traditions  especially in funeral  marriage  inheritance  and the passing of traditional titles  To this day  the Palauan people still hold true to their traditions very seriously  This is very clear in the fact that the traditional government still holds extreme influence over the nation s affairs  In fact  the traditional government has held so much influence  that the federal government has had  on numerous occasions  attempts at limiting its power  Many of these attempts occurred and continue to occur  from 1990 to the present  These attempts  many of which in the form of amendments in the constitution  were put into place because of the corporate sector of the nation  they having felt that the traditional government was encroaching on what they deemed should be free economic zones  One such example occurred in early 2010  where the Idid clan  the ruling clan of the Southern Federation  under the leadership of Bilung  the clan s and Palau s Southern Federation s queen  raised a civil suit against the KSPLA  Koror State Public Lands Authority   In the civil suit  the Idid clan laid claim over Malakal Island  a major economic zone and Palau s most important port  citing claims that went back as far as the German Era  The civil suit  however  ended with the verdict that Idid clan could not use such citations and claims  and resulted in the conclusion that Malakal Island was land that belonged to the KSPLA   edit  Traditional government This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  The present day traditional government of Palau is a direct continuation of the ancient traditional government  composed of practices that span thousands of years  In the traditional government  Palau is divided geographically into different categories  At the smallest level of geographic division is the village or hamlet  then the chiefdom  which is now politically referred to as a state   and finally the federation  or alliance of chiefdoms  In ancient times  there were numerous federations  or alliances  but upon the introduction of firearms by the British in the 17th century  a major imbalance of power occurred  Palau was divided into just two major federations  the northern and southern federations  The Northern Federation is headed by the high chief and chiefess of the ruling clan Uudes of Melekeok state  the Reklai and Ebilreklai  As a result of their position  they are commonly referred to as the king and queen of the Northern Federation  This northern federation comprises the following states  Kayangel  Ngerchelong  Ngardmau  Ngiwal  Ngaraard  Ngatpang  Ngeremlengui  Melekok  Aimeliik  Ngchesar  and Airai  The Southern Federation is likewise represented by the high chief and chiefess of the ruling Idid of Koror state  which also results in their titles as king and queen of the Southern Federation  The Southern Federation comprises the following states  Koror  Peleliu  and Angaur  Despite the presence of these terms however  lesser and lesser Palauans have knowledge of the concept of federations  and the term is slowly dying out  Federations had been established as a way of safeguarding states and hamlets who shared economic  social  and political interests  but now with the advent of modernism and a federal government  there is no need for such safeguarding  It is interesting to note however  that in international relations  the king of Palau is often synonymous with the Ibedul of Koror  This is a result of the fact that Koror is the industrial capital of the nation  and because of such  his position and reputation among the corporate sector of the country has a much greater impact than that of the Reklai of Melekeok  There is also a misconception that the king and queen of Palau  or any chief and his female counterpart for that matter  are married  This is not the case in Palauan society  Traditional leaders and their female counterparts  have always been related and unmarried  marrying relatives in Palauan society has always been a traditional taboo   Usually  a chief and his female counterpart are either brother and sister  or are close cousins  and have their own spouses   edit  Sports Main article  Baseball
