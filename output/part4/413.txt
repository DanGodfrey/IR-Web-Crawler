but has since returned to the living and is now residing on Utopia  Holocaust remained at large in the main Marvel Universe until he joined the Exiles and was killed by another universe s evil version

was considered a dead reality that no longer existed a fact that was frequently mentioned by time line escapees  such as Sugar Man and Blink  However  there were quite a few prequels written that took place before its destruction  Tales From the Age of Apocalypse were intended to be one shot giant size issues that would chronicle a story from the past of each of the Age of Apocalypse titles  Unfortunately  they had poor reception and only two were published  citation needed By the Light told the story of Blink transporting the X Men to the moon where they faced Apocalypse s new horseman of Death  Maximus the Mad  Sinister Bloodlines followed the return of a Brood infected Christopher Summers  Corsair  to Earth and his reunion  after escaping the experimentations of Sinister and Dark Beast  with Scott and Alex  Blink was a four issue miniseries intended to reintroduce the Age of Apocalypse version of Blink as a teaser to the Exiles ongoing series  This story takes place prior to the  Age of Apocalypse  main events  but is largely set in the Negative Zone  Blink becomes lost in the Negative Zone after attempting to incite Blastaar towards war with Apocalypse and instead joins

because an older Nate Grey had time traveled and told Forge about his memories of this event  On the orders of this older Nate Grey  Forge forces the younger Nate to re power the machine and return himself and Sugar Man to Earth 616  This leads to a rift between Forge and Magneto  who believed they should have allowed Nate to stay so that he could help them fight Apocalypse  Later  in X Man  53 and  54  Nate  Jean Grey  and Cyclops run across a temporal rift that brings an infinite processing plant to Earth 616   edit  After the Fall  Age of Apocalypse 10th Anniversary  Main article  Age of Apocalypse  limited series  In 2005  Marvel published an Age of Apocalypse one shot and miniseries to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the fan favorite event  The one shot features stories set before the events depicted in the original  Age of Apocalypse  event  similar in focus to the Tales from the Age of Apocalypse issues  The one shot contains the story of how Colossus and Shadowcat left the X Men to train Generation Next  how Sabretooth met Wild Child  the first appearance of the Silver Samurai  and how the world survived the Human High Council s nuclear attack  The limited series  which takes place after the nuclear attack in X Men  Omega  introduced several characters who were not in the original storyline  Long time characters Cloak and Dagger  Psylocke  and the Morlocks  including Feral  Leech  Marrow  Skids  and Thornn   who were survivors of Mr  Sinister s experiments  are introduced  Newer characters Beak  Icarus  and X 23 are seen along with an alternate version of Xorn  Jean Grey is also revealed to have saved everyone from the nuclear attack by tamping into the Phoenix Force level powers  and is revived from death by Sinister  The Exiles  two of which are from the Age of Apocalypse universe  visited the world as well during this time  this took place in a 2 Part story separate from the 10th Anniversary  AoA  mini seires   the survival of which comes as a surprise to Blink and Sabretooth  Blink was originally removed from The Exiles because her  personal timeline  had been repaired  since her uncorrected fate was to cease to exist  it is implied that her actions with The Exiles combined with Bishop s attempt to correct the timeline and Jean Grey repairing the M Kraan Crystal  resulted in the Age of Apocalypse existing as a separate timeline   edit

The world  which during the previous appearance had seemed to be on the road to recovery  has once again fallen on hard times  similar to when Apocalypse was rulling  with sentinels now roaming the streets  As they follow Dark Beast to one of his labs  they are unknowingly followed by Wildchild and Sabretooth  Earth 295   Dark Beast finds the life seed but before he could hand it over to the X Force members  Nightcrawler teleports in and swipes the seed away  figuring that Dark Beast was up to some evil plot after decades of absence  After a brief quarrel which ended with the life seed destroyed by Sunfire  Psylocke recognizes Sabretooth from her time on the Exiles and convinces Wolverine  Earth 616  that this version of Sabretooth isn t a bad guy  which ends their battle  With the life seed destroyed  Dark Beast sneaks over to the portal back to the 616 Marvel Universe and walks in  leaving X Force stranded in the Age of Apocalypse world  Nightcrawler s team  realizing that the sentinels are descending on their position  evacuates along with X Force  taking them to the X Men s new base in Atlantis  6  Using a version of M O D O K   they discover the body of the slain Celestial which apparently still contains life seeds  However as X Force also learn that the only way to return to the main reality is to seek the help of Gateway who in turn is kept prisoner in the mysterious floating city known as The Sky  the Sentinels soon arrives at Atlantis forcing the group to abandon the complex  As Fantomex leads a small team to the place where the Celestial is  the rest of the team invades The Sky to retrieve Gateway  however they are confronted by the Black Legion and the long thought deceased Weapon X Logan Wolverine Earth 295   who appears using Apocalypse armor  7  Meanwhile  unaware of the problems Wolverine and his team are facing in the fortress  Fantomex and his small crew dive into the heart of the deceased Celestial in order to get the life seed they need to free Warren  After battling some drones  they manage to find the seed and flee with it  losing Gambit in the battle  while  back in the fortress  Wolverine and his crew try to battle Weapon X and the Black Legion  However  Weapon X proves too powerful  since he had offered himself to the Celestials to prevent the planet s judgment and was further augmented by the Celestial technology and while he had ascended in form and power  his mind had become so twisted to the point of sending warriors to kill Charles Lehnsherr  the infant son of Magneto and Rogue  Weapon X easily manages to swat them all and take Jean Grey so he could transform her into Death  a horseman of Apocalypse  To perform the ritual he approaches Storm who was enslaved and transform into a blind seer made of living stone  After taking out the Black Legion and freeing Gateway  Wolverine ask Gateway to open a portal to bring forth Fantomex team  Using Fantomex  they manage to free Jean and open a gateway to their world  Wolverine wants Jean to come too but she refuses and forces them through the gateway with her powers  As X Force returns to their world  they are greeted by Dark Beast  the Horsemen of Apocalypse  and Archangel  now wearing Apocalypse s armor  8   edit  Age of Apocalypse ongoing series In Marvel s recent  Point One   a new team of anti mutant humans calling themselves the X Terminators  pledge to combat the rule of the currently ascended Weapon X and his minions  after X Force s recent attempt to stop the genocidal successor of Apocalypse  The group consists of remaining members of the human race in the Age of Apocalypse who have been pushed to the edge of extinction by mutants  Members of that team are Prophet  William Stryker   Goodnight  a rebuilt Donald Pierce   Deadeye  Zora Risman   Fiend  Francesca Trask   and Horror Show  Graydon Creed    edit  Uncanny X Force 19 1 As Jean Grey and Sabretooth returned from Earth 616  they meet the human coalition  Its also revealed that Jean had ordered much to Magneto s horror  the creation of clones of the Scarlet Witch  so they could use the spell Jean saw previously on Wolverine s mind that de powered 99  of mutantkind  However Weapon X and his forces attack the last human city where Weapon X himself slays both Magneto and Rogue  leaving Jean Grey and Sabretooth the last two X Men alive  Sunfire had given his life to stop Archangel s plans on Earth 616  and Nightcrawler decided to stay on that reality to hunt down Dark Beast  Blob  Iceman and Sugar Man   Jean telepathically nudges clones of the Scarlet Witch to recreate the Decimation and remove all mutants  powers across the globe  However  this was only successful within a radius of 12 feet  so Jean Grey and Sabretooth are both left de powered while Weapon X and his forces remained powered  The human coalition distracts Weapon X with a bomb long enough for the group to escape as the city explodes behind them   edit  What If  There had been various What If  issues revolving around the Age of Apocalypse  In What If   vol  2   77  Legion manages to kill Magneto just as he escapes from the concentration camp he was being held in  Due to Magneto s death  mutants become accepted by the public and the X Men are mutant celebrities  although Xavier senses that something is wrong  Apocalypse attacks a press conference in Washington  D C   with an army of mutants and the X Men are easily defeated  Xavier is forced to bring the now married Jean and Scott out of retirement  Xavier confronts Apocalypse directly while Jean and Scott take on his army  After being taunted that his dream was weak  Xavier kills Apocalypse with a psychic blast that kills himself as well  After sensing Xavier s death  Jean becomes angry and becomes the Phoenix again  causing the area to burn to the ground  Apocalypse s army retreats saying that his dream will live on  even though he is dead  In the aftermath  hatred and persecution of mutants begins to take place  due to the events in D C  Scott reopens the Xavier Institute and carries on Xavier s dream  Apocalypse s forces challenge Scott  saying that only the best dream will survive  In What If   vol  2   81  Tony Stark  Iron Man   head of the human resistance  joins up with Magneto to figure out a way to save Earth from the coming of Galactus  Among Tony s fellow human freedom fighters are the Hulk  Sue Storm  Invisible Woman   and Gwen Stacy  Ultimately  the survivors defeat Galactus by linking all minds on Earth  human and mutant  into one psychic attack  They are left greatly hurt by Galactus  but feeling more unified and capable of stepping past the racism caused by Apocalypse s rule  In 2006  Marvel published a What If  Age of Apocalypse one shot that revealed what would have happened if both Xavier and Magneto were killed by Legion  leaving no one to form the X Men  As explained by Uatu the Watcher  the governments of the world respond to the hundreds of deaths caused by Legion s attack by capturing mutants and sending them into concentration camps  causing non mutant superhumans to flourish  Some mutants  such as Cyclops  who tore out his own eyes to pass as human   flee to the Savage Land  After Apocalypse conquers the world  he gains hundreds of mutant and superhuman followers  including the Absorbing Man  Banshee  Cannonball  the Hulk  Holocaust  Juggernaut  Lady Deathstrike  Namor  the Scarlet Witch  Sebastian Shaw  clones of Spider Man  Storm  and Sunspot  Apocalypse s Horsemen are Hulk  Juggernaut  Namor  and Storm  Apocalypse s followers destroy the mutant sanctuary in the Savage Land and only Sauron and X Man   Nate Summers   escape  They join the Defenders  a group of heroes consisting of Brother Voodoo  the new Sorcerer Supreme   Captain America  wielding Mjolnir   Captain Britain  using Iron Man s armor   Colossus  the Molecule Man  the Thing  using a prosthetic arm   and Wolverine  without adamantium   who have learned the truth about their reality from the sacrifice of Doctor Strange  They have pledged not to change the past  but to overthrow Apocalypse in the present  As they fight back  Nate puts his own plans in motion to change the past  but with tragic consequences  The majority of the Defenders are killed in the struggle against Apocalypse  Nate succeeds in killing Apocalypse with the help of the Molecule Man  Nate then garbs himself in Apocalypse s armor and uses the stolen Eye of Agamotto to open a time portal into the past to stop Legion s actions  Captain America unleashes a bolt from Mjolnir that kills Nate and he and Wolverine walk off  Uatu reveals that by trying to change the past  Nate merely caused events to repeat themselves in yet another reality  as the lightning bolt destroyed Legion  Xavier  Magneto  and hundreds of others  He mentions that this problem is spreading like a cancer across the Multiverse  as reality after reality turns into an Age of Apocalypse   edit  Parodies A one shot titled Marvel Riot was published in December  1995  The one shot featured a parody of the Age of Apocalypse storyline   edit  In other media  edit  Television An Age of Apocalypse like time line is shown in the episode  One Man s Worth  from X Men  The Animated Series  The death of Xavier at the hands of Fitzroy during his college years caused a destructive war between humans and mutants  with Magneto leading the Resistance against the mutant hunting Avengers  Some of the mutants are shown in their Age of Apocalypse costumes from the comics  In the Wolverine and the X Men animated series  after the X Men accomplish their mission in the present to avoid a world ruled by Sentinels  a variant of the Age of Apocalypse reality is shown in the final episode of the first season  Mr  Sinister and Cyclops are depicted in their Age of Apocalypse versions alongside Apocalypse  The series was cancelled before a Season Two revolving around the  Age of Apocalypse  reality could be done  so exactly how it would have been portrayed is unknown   edit  Video games X Men  Reign of Apocalypse is based loosely on the Age of Apocalypse storyline  X Men Legends II  Rise of Apocalypse is heavily influenced by the Age of Apocalypse storyline  including several characters and concepts from the storyline   edit  Trading cards In the VS System trading card game  a series of exclusive cards were
