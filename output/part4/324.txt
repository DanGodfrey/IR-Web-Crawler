1962  and were created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby   edit  Fictional species biography Millions of years ago  the Celestials performed genetic experiments on the reptilian ancestors of the Skrulls  resulting in three branches of Skrulls that eventually warred with one another  The Deviant branch   possessing the innate ability to shapeshift   were triumphant  and afterward wiped out all members of the other two races until only two were left  the Skrull Eternal  Kly bn and Prime Skrull of the original Skrull race  Kly bn implored them to spare his life  as killing him would kill part of their heritage  The Deviants  leader  Sl gur t  fell in love with him  with the two eventually becoming the gods of the Skrull pantheon  As Kly bn could not change  Sl gurt vowed to never keep the same shape for too long  1  Prime Skrull escaped to Earth in the 20th Century and later became a member of the Underground Legion  2  From that point  the Skrulls began to expand their territory  The Deviant branch later split into two more groups  the modern Skrulls and an anomaly called the Dire Wraiths  a parasitic race that could still shapeshift and had use of magic  but were not as technologically advanced as the Skrulls  3  The modern Skrulls originate from the planet of Skrullos  in the Drox System in the Andromeda galaxy  and were originally a mercantile civilization  primarily interested in free trade and willing to share their technology with all races they deemed worthy  When they encountered a new race  they simply transformed themselves to resemble that race  The Skrull empire that resulted from these contacts was based on free trade and mutual cooperation  The empire is controlled by an Emperor and each of the 978 worlds is controlled by a Governor   edit  Kree Skrull War Eventually a Skrull delegation reached the planet Hala  home to the then barbaric Kree and the peaceful Cotati  and held a contest to determine which of the races would represent Hala to the Skrull Empire  Seventeen members of each race were taken to different uninhabited planetoids where they were left with sufficient supplies for one year  At the end of that period  whichever group had done the most with themselves would be adjudged the most worthy  The Kree were taken to Earth s Moon where they built a great city while the Cotati were taken to another barren world in a different solar system and used their abilities to create a beautiful park  Realizing that the Cotati were going to win  the enraged Kree killed all the Cotati  When the Kree revealed that they had solved the question of who would represent Hala to the Skrulls by destroying their opposition  the Skrull delegates were appalled and vowed that Hala would forever be banned from their circle of favored worlds so the Kree massacred them as well  took over the Skrull landing spaceship by force  and developed their own technology from it  Because of the immense distances involved  decades passed before the Skrulls learned of the Kree s activities  By this time it was too late  The Kree were now advanced and audacious enough to attack the Skrulls in their home galaxy  During the millennia that followed  the Kree aggression forced the Skrulls to become a militaristic civilization  and the Skrulls eventually developed the vicious streak needed to conduct intergalactic war  Their entire culture was remade in the warrior image  The Kree Skrull War continued for thousands of years with only brief interruptions  4  The Skrull Throneworld is later moved from Skrullos to the more central Tarnax IV  with their empire encompassing over fifty worlds  5  The Skrulls also created the first Cosmic Cube  which later became the Shaper of Worlds  6  The Kree Accuser Ronan had wrested control of the Kree Empire from the Supreme Intelligence and attacked the Skrulls  reigniting hostilities  The Avengers become involved once the Super Skrull kidnaps Captain Marvel  and in turn they battle a Kree Sentry robot  three of the original Skrulls that had fought the Fantastic Four  S H I E L D  agents  rogue Inhumans and legions of Skrulls  The Supreme Intelligence ends the immediate conflict by revealing to Avengers  ally Rick Jones that he has vast mental potential  which is then used to freeze all combatants in place  The Supreme Intelligence announces that  while the Kree and Skrulls have reached genetic dead ends  the human race displays incredible untapped potential  7  It was revealed years later that the conflict produced a Kree Skrull hybrid  Hulkling  who is the child of one time lovers Captain Marvel and the Skrull Princess Anelle  8   edit  Empire Changing Events The Skrulls became aware of Earth when they discovered a space warp linking Earth and Throneworld  Later they discovered the Earth possesses an equidistant link to Hala  They see Earth as a world to conquer but they are content to hold off a full invasion   Perhaps they are afraid the Kree would learn of the plot   Because of their caution  the Skrulls have sent only a handful of scoutwarriors to infiltrate Earth  but fails to take into account the presence of the modern superhero  In 1958  Skrulls attempted to sabotage Earth s space program  They battled 3 D Man  and set the Cold Warrior against 3 D Man  9  Later a small scouting party used their shape shifting powers to impersonate the Fantastic Four  committing crimes so the country would turn against the Fantastic Four  the only ones with the power to stop them  But the Fantastic Four were able to locate the Skrulls and tricked their leaders into believing the Earth was full of threats  The fleet left and Mr  Fantastic made the Skrulls that were left behind shapeshift into cows and he hypnotized them to remember nothing about their true heritage  10  In retaliation the Skrull Emperor Dorrek VII dispatches Kl rt  a Skrull known as the Super Skrull  to Earth to defeat the Fantastic Four  Kl rt possesses the powers of the entire Fantastic Four  in addition to shapeshifting and hypnotism   and he holds the team at bay until Mister Fantastic discovers the source of his power and uses a miniature device to jam the ray  before the Human Torch imprisons him inside a crater  11  The Super Skrull posed as the jailed Dr  Franklin Storm  after transporting him to the Skrull throneworld  and battled the Fantastic Four as the Invincible Man  another Skrull ultimately caused the death of Dr  Storm by attaching a bomb to his chest before he was transported back  although Storm turned to the floor  saving the Fantastic Four by using his body to shield them from the blast  12  The Fantastic Four later travel to Tarnax IV and find the Skrull responsible for the murder of Susan and Johnny Storm s father  which turned out to be Warlord Morrat   13  Skrulls were involved in other events such as sending the Super Skrull to battle Captain Mar Vell  14  and abducting the Thing as a contestant in the Skrull Games  15  Later the cosmic being the Watcher adjudicates a duel between champions from both races  Colonel Bel Dann of the Kree and Warlord Raksor of the Skrulls  After one year of conflict the duel remains deadlocked and is ultimately abandoned with no resolution  16  Years later during a conflict with Xandar that included the Fantastic Four and the Champions of Xandar  Emperor Dorrek VII s wife  Empress R klll  stages a coup and kills him to become ruling Empress  17  Empress R klll s reign is short lived  however  as the greatest blow to the Skrulls arrieves in the form of the World Devourer Galactus  After his Herald Nova annihilates the Skrull fleet  Galactus devours Tarnax IV  killing billions of Skrulls  including R klll and the Princess Anelle  18  With the destruction of the central government  the Skrull Empire has collapsed into hundreds of bickering factions  Their galaxy is filled with Governors who have declared themselves to be Emperor of the Skrulls and soon a civil war began  The Shi ar maintain a heavy presence in the former empire as well  constantly dealing with packets of resistance   edit  Second Kree Skrull War Later Reed Richards discovered that yet another Governor turned Emperor  Zabyk  had created a genetics bomb  which  when it exploded made all the Skrulls lose their shape shifting abilities  Whatever form they were in they were stuck in at the time of the explosion  19  In desperation  since without their shapeshifting powers they were vulnerable  they managed to kidnap the herald of Galactus  Nova  in an attempt to get Galactus to destroy Kree worlds for them  Their plot failed when the Silver Surfer helped Galactus rescue Nova in exchange for his freedom from Earth  When the Celestials made an appearance  this scared the Skrulls into starting a second war with the Kree to show they were not powerless  The attack was first made by Kylor  one of five governors claiming to be Emperor  He had a spy in the Kree Empire  Nenora  who gave him the early edge  They tried to hide their secret weakness at all costs from the Kree  Kylor was eventually betrayed by Nenora  as was the entire Skrull race  She assumed power of the empire and wished to keep it for herself  It was Empress S byll who stepped up to control the Skrulls and finish the war  She was able to resurrect the Super Skrull and he returned to find the empire in shambles  They tricked the Silver Surfer into attacking a Badoon fleet  which he was not aware were allied with the Kree  Since the Kree waged war on the Surfer  he allied himself with the Skrulls to save Zenn La from destruction  To restore their powers  the Super Skrulls DNA needed to be transferred to S byll  because only a female could spread the ability to the other Skrulls  The Surfer helped them to power a machine that would return the Empress  shape shifting abilities  The device was successful  With this power she was able to restore every Skrull she touched and became the true Empress of the Skrulls  She and Super Skrull waged war with the Kree with the help of the Silver Surfer  She replaced Super Skrull with Captain Reptyl and he helped to change her into a emotionless reptile  But Reptyl was betrayed by one of his own and the Skrull fleet was utterly destroyed by the Kree  S byll and Silver Surfer went alone to attack the Kree homeworld of Hala  Gaining the knowledge that Nenora was actually a Skrull gave them the advantage  S byll gave her shape shifting abilities back to her  crippling her and showing the Kree her true self  A peace treaty was created  The Skrulls eventually broke that peace treaty as they kept their military drive and prefer to fight rather than negotiate  Among the other races contained within the Skrull Empire are the Druff  Guna  Kallusina  Morani  Pheragot  Queega  Tekton  and Yirbek races  Other races remain independent  whether through treaties or open resistance  Such races include the Clegrimites  Gegku  Krylorians  Wilameanis  and Xandarians  The Skrull Xandarian war with the Xandarians recently ended with the destruction of Xandar by the supervillainess Nebula  20   edit  Other Activities Skrulls are meanwhile involved in numerous other activities  They were revealed to have conquered a medieval planet and abandoned it after its inhabitants perished  21  Skrull Prime Ten battled the Fantastic Four and Captain Mar Vell  22  The Skrulls sent their own representative to witness the fate of the Phoenix  at her trial by the Shi ar  There is a lone appearance of Queen Akilll of the Skrull  23  A lone Skrull poisoned Vera Gantor to force the Avengers to seek the Resurrection Stone on his behalf  24  The Skrulls sent their General Zedrao to give the dying Captain Mar Vell the Royal Skrull Medal of Honor  25   edit  Warskrulls A group of genetically bred Skrulls called Warskrulls began infiltrating the Shi ar Empire  26  They used a Nexus Amplifier to assume total physical discorporation of their targets  adopting their super powers along with their physical appearance  They captured and replaced the Starjammers with members of their race as well as key components in government  The Warskrulls  acting under the direction of the paramount among them  posing as a Shi ar called the Chamberlain  began committing murders and even genocide upon various Shi ar affiliated races  such as the P ndyr  in the name of the Shi ar Empire  One Warskrull replaced the Imperial Consort  Professor X  called himself Warlord  and took mental control over Lilandra  the Majestrix of the Shi ar  They were eventually defeated by the combined forces of Deathbird and the X Men and later the Shi ar vowed to weed out any other Warskrulls  27   edit  Infiltrating Earth Some time later a Skrull called Paibok mounts a campaign to invade Earth  using another Skrull called Lyja as an infiltrator  The plan involved secretly replacing the real Alicia Masters  The Thing s blind lover  The plan fell through when she instead seduced Human Torch and the two eventually married one another  The long running facade eventually came to light and the group discovered that the real  human Alicia was actually being held captive by the Skrull nation and Lyja defects  having fallen in love with the Human Torch  The Fantastic Four rescued her  but Lyja seemingly died in the process as she sacrificed herself to save Johnny when Paibok attacked  Paibok later revealed to Devos the Devastator that she was still alive  Paibok  with the assistance of Devos  awoke Lyja from her comatose state  also bestowing her with the power to fly and fire energy blasts from her hands  becoming  Lyja the Lazerfist    These powers were later revealed to come from a special device implanted into her  Joining them in search of vengeance  the three arrived on Earth  and isolated and battled the Torch at Empire State University  Panicking  the Torch burst into his Nova Flame and destroyed the campus  Alongside Devos and Paibok  Lyja witnessed a battle between the Fantastic Four and an alternate Fantastic Four  However  Lyja still bore feelings for the Torch and once again betrayed her cohorts to side with the Fantastic Four which ended with the Fantastic Four destroying the  Skrull War World   the Skrulls  largest attack ship  28   edit  Cadre K A group of Skrulls traveled to Earth where they began plotting to invade the planet once again  They were however at some point approached by Apocalypse who wanted to lure together twelve powerful mutants that he needs to ascend to godhood  At the same time  the body of the Living Monolith  who had been hurled out into the far reaches of space by Thor  is found and brought back to Earth  On Earth  a mutant Skrull named Fiz snuck into Xavier s mansion to tell them urgent news of trouble  the Skrulls have allied themselves with someone powerful and the only thing he knows is that there are twelve mutants that can t be harmed and that something terrible is going to happen  Fiz also reveals the existence of a subtype of Skrulls that possess innate powers like the Earth mutants  Deemed outcasts by the others Skrulls  they were hunted by the Empire  29  After the eventual defeat of Apocalypse  Professor X left into space to train them  giving them the name Cadre K  Cadre K and Xavier returned to Earth during the Ruul s attempt to overtake the planet by turning it into an intergalactic prison  A wounded Z Cann attempted to pass on vital information to Rogue  Their physical contact affected Rogue s powers for some time  The information was received and the X Men were reunited with Bishop  30   edit  Annihilation Main article  Annihilation  comics  The Skrull Empire is the first of the major interstellar empires to be invaded by the forces of Annihilus  The Annihilation Wave s superweapon  the Harvester of Sorrow  physically destroys dozens of Skrull planets  31  In the aftermath the Skrulls unsuccessfully attempt to convince Hulkling to become their new Emperor  8   edit  The Rise and Fall of the Shi ar Empire A group of Warskrulls attacked a remote Shi ar space station and took it over  Disguised as Shi ar  they were taken aboard the space station willingly and slaughtered all those aboard except a few to keep working the ship  The group however was eventually defeated by a group of X Men  Darwin  Havok  Marvel Girl  Rachel Grey   Nightcrawler  Professor X  Warpath   These Warskrulls are however revealed to be cyborgs  32   edit  Secret Invasion Main article  Secret Invasion In the Secret Invasion series by Brian Michael Bendis and Leinil Yu  a flailing Skrull empire  under the leadership of newcomer Queen Veranke  makes an all out effort to infiltrate and conquer Earth  A group of Skrull infiltrators first capture and replace many of Earth s heroes  and these infiltrators are later followed by the main assault group  This wave of Skrulls forms a new version of the Super Skrull  with each possessing the abilities of several different heroes  Their invasion ultimately fails  costing the life of Veranke  and decimating their numbers even further  33  Even their Gods are slain  and the Japanese God of Evil  Amatsu Mikaboshi  takes over their Pantheon  leading to the events of Chaos War  1   edit  Restablishing the Empire After the events of Secret Invasion  the Skrulls  now in smaller numbers  have since began plotting to rise back to power by orchestrating events for their benefits  34   edit  Appearance and abilities Skrulls are green skinned reptilian humanoids with large pointed ears  red or green eyes  and corrugated chins  Skrulls are known for genetic and molecular instability  and genetic diversity  due to Celestial experimentation creating the Skrull  Deviants   now the only surviving Skrulls   The Skrulls are known for their physical malleability and ability to shapeshift to any size  shape  or color at will  taking on the appearance but not the characteristics of other beings and objects within a volume range of  75 to 1 5 times the Skrull s original volume  Skrulls are able to assume virtually any form  be it organic  e g  cows  10   or inorganic  e g  lamp  35    As a result  the Skrulls excel at spying and infiltration  Skrulls are also able to use their shapeshifting abilities to form weapons  e g  blades and clubs  with parts of their bodies  making them dangerous hand to hand combatants  Their sexual dimorphism is roughly the same of a human being  but their sexual orientation is more complex since they can change their genders at will  Indeed  Xavin once casually said that  for a Skrull  changing gender is comparable to a human being changing their hair color  volume  amp  issue needed  The Skrulls later developed the ability to render themselves undetectable when using their shapeshifting abilities  even from telepaths and those with superior senses  36  37  Reed Richards discovered a method to use technology to negate this ability and reveal a disguised Skrull s true form  38  Courtesy of their advanced technology  the Skrulls have also been able to augment their abilities in certain warriors  such as the Super Skrull and War Skrulls   an elite group who with special encoding are able to emulate the powers as well as appearance of their templates  39  It is believed that Skrulls  eyes are incapable of
