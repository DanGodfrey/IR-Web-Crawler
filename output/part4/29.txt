comic book character in the Marvel Comics universe  and one of the first superheroes  debuting in Spring 1939  The character was created by writer artist Bill Everett for Funnies Inc   one of the first  packagers  in the early days of comic books that supplied comics on demand to publishers looking to enter the new medium  Initially created for the unreleased comic Motion Picture Funnies Weekly  the Sub Mariner first appeared publicly in Marvel Comics  1  Oct  1939    the first comic book from Timely Comics  the 1930s 1940s predecessor of the company Marvel Comics  During that period  known to historians and fans as the Golden Age of Comic Books  the Sub Mariner was one of Timely s top three characters  along with Captain America and the original Human Torch  Everett said the character s name was inspired by Samuel Taylor Coleridge s poem   The Rime of the Ancient Mariner   1  Everett came up with  Namor  by writing down noble sounding names backwards and thought Roman Namor looked the best  2  The mutant son of a human sea captain and of a princess of the mythical undersea kingdom of Atlantis  Namor possesses the super strength and aquatic abilities of the  Homo mermanus  race  as well as the mutant ability of flight  along with other superhuman powers  Through the years  he has been alternately portrayed as a good natured but short fused superhero  or a hostile invader seeking vengeance for perceived wrongs that misguided surface dwellers committed against his kingdom  The first known comic book antihero  the Sub Mariner has remained a historically important and relatively popular Marvel character  He has served directly with the Avengers  Fantastic Four  the Invaders  and the X Men as well as serving as a foil to all of them on occasion

planned giveaway comic titled Motion Picture Funnies Weekly  produced by the comic book packager Funnies Inc  The only eight known samples among those created to send to theater owners were discovered in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974  When the giveaway idea fell through  creator Everett used the character for Marvel Comics  1  the first comic book by Funnies  Inc  client Timely Comics  predecessor of Marvel  3  The final panel of the earlier  unpublished eight page Sub Mariner story had included a  Continued Next Week  box that reappeared  sans lettering  in an expanded 12 page story  The series Marvel Comics was retitled Marvel Mystery Comics with issue  2  Dec  1939   Namor s first cover appearance  Marvel Mystery Comics  4  Feb  1940   Art by Alex Schomburg  In his first appearances Namor was an enemy of America  Everett s antihero would eventually battle Carl Burgos  android superhero  the Human Torch  however  as the U S  entered the Second World War  Namor would ally himself with the Torch and the allies against Adolf Hitler and the Axis powers  Other friends included Betty Dean  a New York policewoman introduced in Marvel Mystery Comics  3  and later known as Betty Dean Prentiss   who was a steady companion  and his cousins Namora and Dorma  Namor starred in the Golden Age comic book Sub Mariner Comics  published quarterly  then thrice yearly  and finally bimonthly  from issues  1 32  Fall 1941   June 1949   A backup feature each issue starred the detective superhero the Angel  Along with many other Timely characters  Namor disappeared not long after the end of World War II and the decline in popularity of superhero comics  He also briefly fought crime as a member of the post war superhero team the All Winners Squad  and  through a 1970s retcon  was given a history of having fought with the Allies during World War II in the superhero team the Invaders  Both these super groups were built around the core of Namor  Captain America  and the original Human Torch  Some issues of the 1975 1979 series The Invaders reprinted Golden Age Sub Mariner stories  The Sub Mariner experienced a brief revival in the mid 1950s  starting with Young Men  24  which also briefly revived Captain America and the original Human Torch  and then in Sub Mariner Comics  33 42  April 1954   Oct  1955   During this time  Namora had her own spin off series   edit  Silver Age and after Namor returned in Fantastic Four  4  May 1962   where a member of the titular superhero team  Johnny Storm  the new Human Torch  discovers him living as an amnesiac homeless man in the Bowery section of Manhattan  4  Storm helps him recover his memory  and Namor immediately returns to his undersea kingdom   identified  for the first time in the Marvel canon  as Atlantis  Finding it destroyed from nuclear testing  Namor assumes his people are scattered and that he will never find them  He again becomes an antihero during this period  as  two elements   a thirst for vengeance and a quest for identity   would dominate the Sub Mariner stories of the 1960s  He was both a villain and a hero   striking against the human race who destroyed his home  but also showing a great deal of noblesse oblige to individuals   5  Silver Age Sub Mariner  1  May 1968   Cover art by John Buscema and Sol Brodsky  Initially  Namor variously finds himself allied with the supervillains Doctor Doom and Magneto  but his royal nobility and stubborn independent streak make these alliances of convenience short lived  After various early guest appearances   including in Daredevil  7  April 1965   a rare superhero story drawn by comics great Wally Wood   Namor receives his own starring feature in the split title comic Tales to Astonish  beginning issue  70  Aug  1965   By now  during a period fans and historians call the Silver Age of Comic Books  he is more authoritative  arrogant  and solemn than the impetuous youthful character of the 1940s and mid 1950s  speaking in neo Shakespearean dialogue rather than the more colloquial speech of his youth  often shouting his battle cry   Imperius Rex   He was spun off into his own title  the 1968 74 series The Sub Mariner Some of the later issues of this series are notable for having been written and drawn by the character s creator  Bill Everett  shortly before his death  as well  they reintroduced a now older Namora  and introduced her daughter  Namorita Prentiss  By now more of a reluctant superhero  the Sub Mariner was perfect for the Marvel Age of angst ridden protagonists  Noble yet misunderstood  powerful yet thwarted      he was  portrayed as a regal monarch   a king without a country   6  Following a four issue miniseries a decade later  Prince Namor  the Sub Mariner  Sept  Dec  1984   by co writers Bob Budiansky and J  M  DeMatteis and art by penciler Budiansky and inker Danny Bulanadi  Namor again received an ongoing series in 1990  Namor  the Sub Mariner  which ran 62 issues  April

Jae Lee  with Bob Harras scripting from  33 40  Thereafter came a variety of artists and writers  This series followed Namor as CEO of Oracle  Inc   a corporation devoted to reducing pollution  particularly in the oceans  and provided the stage for the return of the 1970s martial artist superhero Iron Fist  who had been presumed dead  The 12 issue miniseries Namor  June 2003   May 2004   credited to co writers Bill Jemas  then Marvel s president  and Andi Watson  and penciled initially by Salvador Larroca and later by Pat Olliffe and others  explored Namor s youth  charting his

less than a year in publication  8  Never fundamentally either a hero or a villain  Namor has protected his kingdom and sought vengeance on the surface world only when he feels his realm is threatened  Although he has served alongside  or even as a member of  superhero teams   most notably the Defenders  a  non team  in which through mystical means he was forced to ally with Doctor Strange  the Hulk  and the Silver Surfer  the Avengers  and both the World War II and modern day versions of the Invaders   Namor remains an outsider  Marvel revived The Defenders series in December 2011  9  The

details and making it more concise   October 2011  Because of his unusual genetic heritage  Namor is unique among both ordinary humans and Atlanteans  he is sometimes referred to as  Marvel s first mutant   because  while the majority of his observed superhuman powers come from the fact that he s a hybrid of Human and Atlantean DNA  his ability to fly can t be explained by either side  Atlanteans are an off shoot of  baseline  humanity   though  in terms of in continuity chronology  there were many mutants in existence before Namor  Namor possesses a fully amphibious physiology suited for extreme undersea pressures  superhuman strength  speed  agility  durability  flight  and longevity  Namor has the ability to survive underwater for indefinite periods  and specially developed vision which gives him the ability to see clearly in the murky depths of the ocean  Bill Everett  in his first Sub Mariner story  described the character as  an ultra man of the deep  who  lives on land and in the sea  flies in the air   and  has the strength of a thousand  surface  men   No other powers were mentioned  When the series was revived in 1954  Namor lost his ankle wings and with them the power of flight  they  and his full strength  were restored in Sub Mariner  38  Feb  1955   in which Everett additionally wrote a flashback story   Wings on His Feet   detailing their appearance on Namor at age 14  This story was twice reprinted during the Silver Age of Comic Books  in Marvel Super Heroes  17  Nov  1968   and in the book Comix by Les Daniels  Namor possesses wings on his ankles to which he attributes his power of flight  On occasions when they have been lost or badly damaged  he has experienced a loss of flying ability  He could not fly as a child  and the power only manifested when the wings developed in adolescence  Namor has the ability to swim at superhuman speeds  even by Atlantean standards  The exact limit of his speed is unverified  but must at least be an excess of 70 knots  Namor has greater longevity than a normal human being  He is well over 80 years old as he was born in 1920 in the Marvel timeline  but has the appearance of a male in his prime  His identity as a pre World War II superhero is well established  making him less subject to the sliding timescale of the Marvel universe  After he was revived yet again in the 1960s by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby  Namor demonstrated powers of various sealife that had not been shown in earlier stories  However  an editorial note in Marvel Tales  9  July 1967   stated explicitly that  nautical Namor has since lost his power to imitate the characteristics of fish     According to one of Sub Mariner s scripters  Roy Thomas   As for Namor s electrical and other sea creaturely powers  They were used in one or two stories in F F  and the Human Torch series in Strange Tales  then dropped   as one of Stan  Lee  and Jack  Kirby s early  and quite forgivable  mistakes  The explanation  given in a reprint of a Torch Namor bout a few years later  was that he had these powers only for a short time and then lost them   11  In all his incarnations  Namor possesses superhuman strength and  with the possible exceptions of Orka and Tyrak at their full sizes  is the strongest Atlantean ever known  The exact level of his strength is dependent upon his physical contact with water  in which he needn t be submerged  It has been shown as sufficient to effortlessly toss a water filled ocean liner  despite the underwater viscosity  12  His strength diminishes slowly the longer he is out of contact with water  though an extended period on land does not result in his death  as it would for a typical Atlantean  and his power is retained in full as long as he keeps himself wet  Namor also possesses superhuman stamina and resistance to injury due to his hybrid nature  Namor s strength level is such that he has held his own in hand to hand combat with beings as powerful as the Hulk in the past  13  Some stories have mentioned that Namor has gills for breathing underwater  14  and artists such as Salvador Larroca have drawn him with gill slits on either side of his neck  15  In The Sub Mariner  18 22  1969 70   beings from outer space surgically closed Namor s gills for a time  leaving him with the ability to breathe air but unable to breathe underwater  Other sources have stated that his lungs contain oxygen diffusing membranes that allow him to breathe underwater  Due to a unique aspect of his hybrid nature  not shared by Namorita   it was theorized that Namor is vulnerable to oxygen imbalances in his blood that trigger manic depressive mood swings  he can prevent imbalances by regular immersion in water  Namor gives off a sense of charisma which most women tend to find captivating  Many of the ladies that have entered his life made clear their attraction to his masculine  slightly alien personality in ways both subtle and blatant  He reacts to such advances with gratitude tinged with a slight distance born of monarchical etiquette  Namor is a natural leader  trained by the royal family of Atlantis as befitting an heir to the throne  He has historically led troops into battle with expert success  His typical interpersonal behavior with both subject and friend borders on the aloof  however this is more a sense of regal noblesse oblige rather than snobbishness  Namor was given possession of the Time Gem  16  This gem allows the user total control over the past  present  and future  It also allows time travel  can age and de age beings  and can also be used as a weapon by trapping enemies or entire worlds in unending loops of time  After the Hood attempted to steal the Gems  Namor briefly helped Thor recover the Gem from the bottom of the ocean to prevent the Hood acquiring it  before being entrusted with the Power Gem as the Gems were divided amongst the new Illuminati   Steve Rogers replacing Black Bolt   once again  17  Namor was educated by the royal tutors of the Atlantean court  and speaks English  Atlantean  and Lemurian  He is a highly skilled business executive   edit  Formerly depicted abilities In The Fantastic Four  9  Dec  1962   Namor states   I have the powers of all the creatures who live beneath the sea  I can charge the very air with electricity   using the power of the electric eel   In the same issue   the radar sense of the cave fish from the lowest depths of the sea  enables him to sense the presence of Sue Storm when she is invisible  He uses  the power to surround himself with electricity in the manner of an electric eel  again in Strange Tales  107  April 1963   and  125  Oct  1964   in the former he also manifests the power to inflate his body like a puffer fish  These extra powers were ignored  however  when Marvel gave Namor his own feature beginning in Tales to Astonish  70  Aug  1965   Another ability unknown in the Golden Age and rarely displayed is his telepathic rapport with many forms of marine life  He also had a limited empathic rapport with Namorita  But  only as a result of being given one of her  magic earrings   which has long since disappeared   An editorial note in Marvel Tales  9  July 1967   which reprinted the story from Strange Tales  107  stated explicitly that  nautical Namor has since lost his power to imitate the characteristics of fish      His electrical abilities were  however  seen out of comic continuity in 1991 s Spider Man  The Video Game  Furthermore  Namor employed these  lost  powers semi regularly in his 1990s series  under John Byrne s pen  In his first battle against the original Human Torch  Namor twice spouted water from his body in a manner explicitly likened to a sprinkler system  volume  amp  issue needed   edit   Marvel s First Mutant  Marvel has repeatedly identified Namor as  Marvel s first mutant   which is true with regard to the order in which the character appeared in print  However  he is not the oldest mutant in the fictional Marvel Universe timeline  A number of mutants predate him  including Apocalypse  born in the 30th century BC   Selene  active since at least 10 000 BC   Exodus  born in the 12th century AD   Wolverine  late 19th century AD   Mystique and Destiny  dates of birth unknown  but known to have been active at the  Dawn of the 20th century    the demonic mutant Azazel  and a group of mutants known as the Externals  In X Men  6  July 1964   X Men leader Professor Xavier and antagonist Magneto each suspect Namor is a mutant  Later writers in the 1960s and 1970s described him as a hybrid  not a mutant  in order to distinguish him from the mutant X Men  18  When the series was revived in 1990  the series title logo carried the subtitle  Marvel s first and mightiest mutant   Namor is actually a hybrid of Atlantean and Human physiology  although he has principal characteristics that neither Atlanteans  Homo mermanus  nor Humans  Homo sapiens  possess  These include his ability to fly  his strength  which is several times that of an Atlantean   and other seldom seen  since the early 1960s  abilities including electricity generation  radar sense  and telepathic rapport with marine life  In the first issue of the five part Illuminati miniseries  after being experimented on by the Skrulls  it was confirmed that Namor is not only an Atlantean human hybrid but also a mutant   edit  Enemies Attuma   Leader of the Atlantean barbarians  Attuma would threaten Atlantis repeatedly  conquering it on several occasions  and became Namor s nemesis  Byrrah   Childhood friend and rival to Namor  Byrrah was Atlantean royalty that lost the throne to Namor and observed him as unfit for the position  For many years  he would challenge Namor s rule and ally with his enemies to usurp him although  In recent years  he appears to have made peace with Namor and stands by his side as a brother  Captain Barracuda   A modern day pirate employing advanced technology that frequently crossed swords with Namor  and several other heroes   Deep Six   A group formed by Attuma to maintain his rule of Atlantis during one of his periods as its conqueror  His subordinates included Tiger Shark  Orka  Piranha  Sea Urchin  and Nagala  bearing the Serpent Crown   Doctor Doom   Sometimes allies as enemies  Doom and Namor use each other but inevitably turn against each other when their ultimate sensibilities override the benefits of working together  This has been their perpetual relationship since first meeting years ago  Doctor Dorcas   A brilliant scientist that created several of Namor s greatest threats  such as Tiger Shark  Orka  and Piranha   often working alongside the likes of Attuma and Byrrah  He died in a battle with Namor

 Fathom Five sought to wipe out humanity  Its members include Dragonrider  Bloodtide  Manowar  and Sea Leopard  Great White   An albino villain and shark trainer  He ambushed Loa and her father while they were surfing  Loa managed to use her ability to kill the sharks while Great White was defeated by Namor  Karthon the Quester   A faithful servant to Lemurian ruler Naga that sought the Serpent
