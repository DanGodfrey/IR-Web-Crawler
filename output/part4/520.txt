either 1492 and Columbus  or  especially in recent years  with the prehistory of the Native peoples  Officially the United States of America began as an independent nation with the Declaration of Independence in July 1776  European colonists reached the Gulf and Pacific coasts  but the largest settlements were by the English on the East Coast  starting in 1607  By the 1770s the Thirteen Colonies contained two and half million people  They were prosperous  and had developed their own political and legal systems  The British government s threat to American self government led to war in 1775 and the Declaration of Independence in 1776  With major military and financial support from France  the patriots won the American Revolution  In 1789 the Constitution became the basis for the United States federal government  with war hero George Washington as the first president  The young nation continued to struggle with the scope of central government and with European influence  creating the first political parties in the 1790s  and fighting a second war for independence in 1812  U S  territory expanded westward across the continent  brushing aside Native Americans and Mexico  and overcoming modernizers who wanted to deepen the economy rather than expand the geography  Slavery of Africans was abolished in the North  but heavy world demand for cotton let it flourish in the Southern states  Through shipping  manufacturing and supplies  major northern cities were closely tied to the Southern cotton economy and slavery as well  For 50 of the 72 years between the election of George Washington and that of Abraham Lincoln  a slaveholder served as president of the United States and  during that period  only slaveholding presidents were re elected to second terms  1  The 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln  who called for no more expansion of slavery  triggered a crisis as eleven slave states seceded to found the Confederate States of America in 1861  The bloody American Civil War  1861 65  redefined the nation and remains the central iconic event  The South was defeated and  in the Reconstruction era  the U S  ended slavery  extended rights to African Americans  and readmitted secessionist states with loyal governments  The national government was much stronger  and it now had the explicit duty to protect individuals  Reconstruction was never completed by the US government and left the blacks in a world of Jim Crow political  social and economic inferiority  The entire South remained poor while the North and West grew rapidly  Thanks to an outburst of entrepreneurship in the North and the arrival of millions of immigrant workers from Europe  the U S  became the leading industrialized power by 1900  Disgust with corruption  waste  and traditional politics stimulated the Progressive movement  1890s 1920s  which pushed for reform in industry and politics and put into the Constitution women s suffrage and Prohibition of alcohol  the latter repealed in 1933   Initially neutral in World War I  the U S  declared war on Germany in 1917  and funded the Allied victory  The nation refused to follow President Woodrow Wilson s leadership and never joined the League of Nations  After a prosperous decade in the 1920s the Wall Street Crash of 1929 marked the onset of the decade long world wide Great Depression  A political realignment expelled the Republicans from power and installed Democrat Franklin D  Roosevelt and his elaborate and expensive New Deal programs for relief  recovery  and reform  Roosevelt s Democratic coalition  comprising ethnics in the north  labor unions  big city machines  intellectuals  and the white South  dominated national politics into the 1960s  After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941  the U S  entered World War II alongside the Allies and helped defeat Nazi Germany in Europe and  with the detonation of newly invented atomic bombs  Japan in Asia and the Pacific  The Soviet Union and the U S  emerged as opposing superpowers after the war and began the Cold War confronting indirectly in an arms race  the Space Race  and intervention in Europe and eastern Asia  Liberalism reflected in the civil rights movement and opposition to war in Vietnam peaked in the 1960s 70s before giving way to conservatism in the early 1980s  The Cold War ended when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991  leaving the U S  to prosper in the booming Information Age economy that was boosted  at least in part  by information technology  International conflict and economic uncertainty heightened by 2001 with the September 11 attacks and subsequent War on Terror and the late 2000s recession  Contents 1 Pre Columbian era 2 Colonial period 2 1 Spanish  Dutch  and French colonization 2 2 British

when the Native Americans first settled the Americas and the present day United States  The prevailing theory proposes that people migrated from Eurasia across Beringia  a land bridge that connected Siberia to present day Alaska  and then spread southward throughout the Americas  This migration might have begun as early as 30 000 years ago 2  and continued through to about 10 000 years ago  when the land bridge became submerged by the rising sea level caused by the ending of the last glacial period  3  These early inhabitants  called Paleoamericans  soon diversified into many hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes  The pre Columbian era incorporates all period subdivisions in the history and prehistory of the Americas before the appearance of significant European influences on the American continents  spanning the time of the original settlement in the Upper Paleolithic period to European colonization during the Early Modern period  While technically referring to the era before Christopher Columbus  voyages of 1492 to 1504  in practice the term usually includes the history of American indigenous cultures until they were conquered or significantly influenced by Europeans  even if this happened decades or even centuries after Columbus  initial landing  Colonial period The Spanish conquistador Coronado explored parts of the American Southwest from 1540 to 1542  Main article  Colonial history of the United States After a period of exploration by people from various European countries  Spanish  Dutch  English  French  Swedish  and Portuguese settlements were established  In the 16th century  Europeans brought horses  cattle  and hogs to the Americas and  in turn  took back to Europe maize  potatoes  tobacco  beans  and squash  The disease environment was very unhealthy for explorers and early settlers  The Native Americans became exposed to new diseases such as smallpox and measles and died in very large numbers  usually before large scale European settlement began  Spanish  Dutch  and French colonization Spanish explorers were the first Europeans to arrive in what is now the United States with Christopher Columbus  second expedition  which reached Puerto Rico on November 19  1493  others reached Florida in 1513  4  Quickly Spanish expeditions reached the Appalachian Mountains  the Mississippi River  the Grand Canyon 5  and the Great Plains  In 1540  Hernando de Soto undertook an extensive exploration of Southeast  Also in 1540 Francisco V zquez de Coronado explored from Arizona to central Kansas  6  The Spanish sent some settlers  creating the first permanent European settlement in the continental United States at St  Augustine  Florida in 1565  but it attracted few permanent settlers  Much larger and more important Spanish settlements included Santa Fe  Albuquerque  San Antonio  Tucson  San Diego  Los Angeles and San Francisco  7  European territorial claims in North America  c  1750   France   Kingdom of Great Britain   Spain New Netherland was the 17th century Dutch colony centered on New York City and the Hudson River Valley  where they traded furs with the Native Americans to the north and were a barrier to Yankee expansion from New England  The Dutch were Calvinists who built the Reformed Church in America  but they were tolerant of other religions and cultures  The colony was taken over by Britain in 1664  It left an enduring legacy on American cultural and political life  including a secular broadmindedness and mercantile pragmatism in the city  a rural traditionalism in the countryside typified by the story of Rip Van Winkle  and politicians such as Martin Van Buren  Theodore Roosevelt  Franklin D  Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt  8  New France was the area colonized by France from 1534 to 1763  There were few permanent settlers outside Quebec and Acadia  but the Wabanaki Confederacy became military allies of New France through the four French and Indian Wars with the British colonies who were allied with the Iroquois Confederacy  During the French and Indian War  New England fought successfully against Acadia and the British removed Acadians from Acadia  Nova Scotia  and replaced them with New England Planters  9  Eventually  some Acadians resettled in Louisiana  where they developed a distinctive rural Cajun culture that still exists  They became American citizens in 1803 with the Louisiana Purchase  10  Other French villages along the Mississippi and Illinois rivers were absorbed when the Americans started arriving after 1770  British colonization Further information  British colonization of the Americas The Mayflower  which transported Pilgrims to the New World  During the first winter at Plymouth  about half of the Pilgrims died  11  The strip of land along the eastern seacoast was settled primarily by English colonists in the 17th century  along with much smaller numbers of Dutch and Swedes  Colonial America was defined by a severe labor shortage that employed forms of unfree labor such as slavery and indentured servitude  and by a British policy of benign neglect  salutary neglect  that permitted the development of an American spirit distinct from that of its European founders  12  Over half of all European immigrants to Colonial America arrived as indentured servants  13  The first successful English colony was established in 1607  on the James River at Jamestown  It languished for decades until a new wave of settlers arrived in the late 17th century and established commercial agriculture based on tobacco  Between the late 1610s and the Revolution  the British shipped an estimated 50 000 convicts to their American colonies  14  One example of conflict between Native Americans and English settlers was the 1622 Powhatan uprising in Virginia  in which Native Americans had killed hundreds of English settlers  The largest conflict between Native Americans and English settlers in the 17th century was King Philip s War in New England  15  although the Yamasee War may have been bloodier  16  New England was initially settled primarily by Puritans who established the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630  although there was a small earlier settlement in 1620 by a similar group  the Pilgrims  at Plymouth Colony  The Middle Colonies  consisting of the present day states of New York  New Jersey  Pennsylvania  and Delaware  were characterized by a large degree of diversity  The first attempted English settlement south of Virginia was the Province of Carolina  with Georgia Colony the last of the Thirteen Colonies established in 1733  17  The colonies were characterized by religious diversity  with many Congregationalists in New England  German and Dutch Reformed in the Middle Colonies  Catholics in Maryland  and Scotch Irish Presbyterians on the frontier The First Great Awakening  Many royal officials and merchants were Anglicans  Religion expanded greatly after the First Great Awakening  a religious revival in the 1740s led by preachers such as Jonathan Edwards  American Evangelicals affected by the Awakening added a new emphasis on divine outpourings of the Holy Spirit and conversions that implanted within new believers an intense love for God  Revivals encapsulated those hallmarks and forwarded the newly created evangelicalism into the early republic  setting the stage for the Second Great Awakening beginning in the late 1790s  18  Political integration and autonomy Join  or Die  This 1756 political cartoon by Benjamin Franklin urged the colonies to join together during the French and Indian War  The French and Indian War  1754 1763  was a watershed event in the political development of the colonies  The influence of the main rivals of the British Crown in the colonies and Canada  the French and North American Indians  was significantly reduced  Moreover  the war effort resulted in greater political integration of the colonies  as symbolized by Benjamin Franklin s call for the colonies to  Join or Die   Following Britain s acquisition of French territory in North America  King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 with the goal of organizing the new North American empire and stabilizing relations with the native Indians  In ensuing years  strains developed in the relations between the colonists and the Crown  The British Parliament passed the Stamp Act of 1765  imposing a tax on the colonies to help pay for troops stationed in North America following the British victory in the Seven Years  War  The British government felt that the colonies were the primary beneficiaries of this military presence  and should pay at least a portion of the expense  The colonists did not share this view  Rather  with the French and Indian threat diminished  the primary outside influence remained that of Britain  A conflict of economic interests increased with the right of the British Parliament to govern the colonies without representation being called into question  Nathaniel Currier s 1846 depiction of the Boston Tea Party  The Boston Tea Party in 1773 was a direct action by colonists in the town of Boston to protest against the taxes levied by the British government  Parliament responded the next year with the Coercive Acts  which sparked outrage and resistance in the Thirteen Colonies  Colonists convened the First Continental Congress to coordinate their resistance to the Coercive Acts  The Congress called for a boycott of British trade  published a list of rights and grievances  and petitioned the king for redress of those grievances  The Congress also called for another meeting if their petition did not halt enforcement of the Coercive Acts  Their appeal to the Crown had no effect  and so the Second Continental Congress was convened in 1775 to organize the defense of the colonies at the onset of the American Revolutionary War  Formation of the United States of America  1776 1789  Main article  History of the United States  1776 1789  Washington s surprise crossing of the Delaware River in Dec  1776 was a major comeback after the loss of New York City  his army defeated the British in two battles and recaptured New Jersey  The Thirteen Colonies began a rebellion against British rule in 1775 and proclaimed their independence in 1776 as the United States of America  In the American Revolutionary War  1775 1783  the American capture of the British invasion army at Saratoga in 1777 secured the Northeast and encouraged the French to make a military alliance with the United States  France brought in Spain and the Netherlands  thus balancing the military and naval forces on each side as Britain had no allies  19  General George Washington  1732 1799  proved an excellent organizer and administrator  who worked successfully with Congress and the state governors  selecting and mentoring his senior officers  supporting and training his troops  and maintaining an idealistic Republican Army  His biggest challenge was logistics  since neither Congress nor the states had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment  munitions  clothing  paychecks  or even the food supply of the soldiers  As a battlefield tactician Washington was often outmaneuvered by his British counterparts  As a strategist  however  he had a better idea of how to win the war than they did  The British sent four invasion armies  Washington s strategy forced the first army out of Boston in 1776  and was responsible for the surrender of the second and third armies at Saratoga  1777  and Yorktown  1781   He limited the British control to New York and a few places while keeping Patriot control of the great majority of the population  The Loyalists  whom the British counted upon too heavily  comprised about 20  of the population but never were well organized  As the war ended  Washington watched proudly as the final British army quietly sailed out of New York City in November 1783  taking the Loyalist leadership with them  Washington astonished the world when  instead of seizing power for himself  he retired quietly to his farm in Virginia  20  Political scientist Seymour Martin Lipset observes   The United States was the first major colony successfully to revolt against colonial rule  In this sense  it was the first  new nation    21  Trumbull s Declaration of Independence On July 4  1776  the Second Continental Congress  meeting in Philadelphia  declared the independence of  the United States of America  in the Declaration of Independence  July 4 is celebrated as the nation s birthday  The new nation was founded on Enlightenment ideals of liberalism in what Thomas Jefferson called the unalienable rights to  life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness   and dedicated strongly to republican principles  Republicanism emphasized the people are sovereign  not hereditary kings   demanded civic duty  feared corruption  and rejected any aristocracy  22  In the 1780s the national government was able to settle the issue of the western territories  which were ceded by the states to Congress and became territories  with the migration of settlers to the Northwest  soon they became states  Nationalists worried that the new nation was too fragile to withstand an international war  or even internal revolts such as the Shays  Rebellion of 1786 in Massachusetts  Nationalists most of them war veterans organized in every state and convinced Congress to call the Philadelphia Convention in 1787  The delegates from every state wrote a new Constitution that created a much more powerful and efficient central government  one with a strong president  and powers of taxation  The new government reflected the prevailing republican ideals of guarantees of individual liberty and of constraining the power of government through a system of separation of powers  23  Although some delegates had hoped to end slavery  southern delegates negotiated protection of the international slave trade for 20 years  In addition  three fifths of the population of slaves was to be counted toward each state s total population for purposes of Congressional apportionment  As slavery expanded in the South during the following decades  this provision increased the political power of southern representatives in Congress  To assuage the Anti Federalists who feared a too powerful national government  the nation adopted the United States Bill of Rights in 1791  Comprising the first ten amendments of the Constitution  it guaranteed individual liberties such as freedom of speech and religious practice  jury trials  and stated that citizens and states had reserved rights  which were not specified   24  Civil religion The American Revolution was the main source of the non denominational American civil religion that shaped patriotism ever since  It produced a Moses like leader  George Washington   prophets  Thomas Jefferson  Tom Paine  and martyrs  Boston Massacre  Nathan Hale   as well as devils  Benedict Arnold   sacred places  Valley Forge   rituals  raising the Liberty Tree   flags  the Betsey Ross flag   sacred holidays  July 4  and a holy scripture  The Declaration of Independence  the Constitution and the Bill of Rights   25  Early national era  1789 1849  Main article  History of the United States  1789 1849  See also  First Party System and Second Party System Economic growth in America per capita income George Washington a renowned hero of the American Revolutionary War  commander in chief of the Continental Army  and president of the Constitutional Convention became the first President of the United States under the new Constitution in 1789  The major accomplishments of the Washington Administration were creating a strong national government that was recognized without question by all Americans  and  following the plans of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton  assuming the debts of the states  the debt holders received federal bonds   creating the Bank of the United States to stabilize the financial system  setting up a uniform system of tariffs  taxes on imports  and other taxes to pay off the debt and provide a financial infrastructure  To support his programs Hamilton created a new political party the first in the world based on voters the Federalist Party  Thomas Jefferson and James Madison led the opposition  forming an opposition Republican Party  usually called the Democratic Republican Party by historians   Hamilton and Washington presented the country in 1794 with the Jay Treaty that reestablished good relations with Britain  The Jeffersonians vehemently protested  and the voters aligned behind one party or the other  thus setting up the First Party System  The treaty passed  but politics became very heated  26  The Whiskey Rebellion in 1794  when western settlers protested against a federal tax on liquor  was the first serious test of the federal government  Washington called out the state militia and personally led an army  as the insurgents melted away and the power of the national government was firmly established  27  Washington refused to serve more than two terms setting a precedent and in famous his farewell address  he extolled the benefits of federal government and importance of ethics and morality while warning against foreign alliances and the formation of political parties  28  During the first two decades after the Revolutionary War  there were dramatic changes in the status of slavery among the states and an increase in the number of freed blacks  Inspired by revolutionary ideals of the equality of men and their lesser economic reliance on it  northern states abolished slavery  although some had gradual emancipation schemes  States of the Upper South made manumission easier  resulting in an increase in the proportion of free blacks in the Upper South from less than one percent in 1792 to more than 10 percent by 1810  By that date  a total of 13 5 percent of all blacks in the United States were free  29  After that date  with the demand for slaves on the rise with the development of the Deep South for cotton cultivation  the rate of manumissions declined sharply  and an internal slave trade became an important source of wealth for many planters and traders  John Adams  a Federalist  defeated Jefferson in the 1796 election  War loomed with France and the Federalists used the opportunity to try to silence the Republicans with the Alien and Sedition Acts  build up a large army with Hamilton at the head  and prepare for a French invasion  However  the Federalists became divided after Adams sent a successful peace mission to France that ended the Quasi War of 1798  Territorial expansion Thomas Jefferson defeated Adams for the presidency in the 1800 election  30  He is known for the Louisiana Purchase  in 1803  which ended the French presence from the western border of the United States and provided U S  settlers with vast potential for expansion west of the Mississippi River  31  Although the Constitution included a Supreme Court  its functions were vague until John Marshall  the Chief Justice  1801 35   defined them  especially the power to overturn acts of Congress that violated the Constitution  first enunciated in 1803 in Marbury v  Madison  32  In response to multiple grievances  the Congress declared war on Britain in 1812  The grievances included humiliating the Americans in the Chesapeake incident of 1807  continued British impressment of American sailors into the Royal Navy  restrictions on trade with France  and arming hostile Indians in Ohio and the western territories  33  The War of 1812 ended in a draw after bitter fighting that lasted until January 8  1815  during the Battle of New Orleans  The Americans gained no territory but were cheered by a sense of victory in what they called a  second war of independence   The war was a major loss for Native American tribes in the Northwest and Southeast who had allied themselves with Britain and were defeated on the battlefield  As strong opponents of the war  the Federalists held the Hartford Convention in 1814 that hinted at disunion  National euphoria after the victory at New Orleans ruined the prestige of the Federalists and they no longer played a significant role  34  President Madison and most Republicans realized it had been a mistake to let the Bank of the United States close down  for its absence greatly hindered the financing of the war  So they chartered the Second Bank of the United States in 1816  The Republicans also imposed tariffs designed to protect the infant industries that had been created when Britain was blockading the U S  With the collapse of the Federalists as a party  the adoption of many Federalist principles by the Republicans  and the systematic policy of President James Monroe in his two terms  1817 25  to downplay partisanship  the nation entered an Era of Good Feelings  with far less partisanship than before  or after   and closed out the First Party System  35  36  The Monroe Doctrine  expressed in 1823  proclaimed the United States  opinion that European powers should no longer colonize or interfere in the Americas  This was a defining moment in the foreign policy of the United States  The Monroe Doctrine was adopted in response to American and British fears over Russian and French expansion into the Western Hemisphere  37  Settlers crossing the Plains of Nebraska In 1830  Congress passed the Indian Removal Act  which authorized the president to negotiate treaties that exchanged Native American tribal lands in the eastern states for lands west of the Mississippi River  This established Andrew Jackson  a military hero and President  as a proponent of the forcible removal of native populations to the West  The act resulted most notably in the Trail of Tears  a forced migration of several native tribes to the West  with several thousand people dying en route  38  Many of the Seminole Indians in Florida refused to move west  they fought the Army for years in the Seminole Wars  After 1840 the growing abolitionist movement redefined itself as a crusade against the sin of slave ownership  It mobilized support  especially among religious women in the Northeast affected by the Second Great Awakening   William Lloyd Garrison published the most influential of the many anti slavery newspapers  The Liberator  while Frederick Douglass  an ex slave  began writing for that newspaper around 1840 and started his own abolitionist newspaper North Star in 1847  39  The great majority of anti slavery elements rejected its moralism and held that slavery was an unfortunate social evil  not a sin  The Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845  which Mexico had warned meant war  The U S  army  using regulars and large numbers of volunteers  easily won the Mexican American War  1846 48  Public sentiment in the U S  was divided as Whigs and anti slavery elements opposed the war  The 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ceded California  New Mexico  and adjacent areas to the United States  with the residents given full citizenship  Simultaneously gold was discovered  pulling over 100 000 men to northern California in a matter of months in the California Gold Rush  Civil War era  1849 1865  Main article  History of the United States  1849 1865  The Union  blue  free   yellow  slave   The Confederacy  brown  territories in light shades The churches split on slavery  with the Methodists and Baptists dividing into northern and southern denominations  In the North  the Methodists  Congregationalists and Quakers included many abolitionists  especially among women activists  The Catholic  Episcopal and Lutheran denominations ignored the slavery issue  The issue of slavery in the new territories was seemingly settled by the Compromise of 1850 brokered by Whig Henry Clay and Democrat Stephen Douglas  the Compromise included admission of California as a free state  The sore point was the Fugitive Slave Act to make it easier for masters to reclaim runaway slaves  with abolitionists used it to attack slavery  as in Uncle Tom s Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe  The Compromise of 1820 was repealed in 1854 with the Kansas Nebraska Act  promoted by Senator Douglas in the name of  popular sovereignty  and democracy  It permitted settlers to decide on slavery in each territory  and allowed Douglas to say he was neutral on the slavery issue  Antislavery forces rose in anger and alarm  forming the new Republican Party  Pro and anti forces rushed to Kansas to vote slavery up or down  resulting in a mini civil war called Bleeding Kansas  By the late 1850s the young Republican Party dominated nearly all northern states and thus the electoral college  and insisted that slavery would never be allowed to expand  and thus would slowly die out   The southern slave societies had become wealthy based on their cotton and other commodity production  and some particularly profited from the internal slave trade  They were tied to northern cities such as New York City by banking  shipping  and manufacturing  as northerners supplied many goods to planters  By 1860  there were nearly four million slaves  held primarily in the South  nearly eight times as many as the total slaves nationwide in 1790  within the same time period  cotton production in the U S  boomed from less than a thousand tons to nearly one million tons per year  For 50 of the 72 years between the election of George Washington and that of Abraham Lincoln  a slaveholder served as president of the United States and  during that period  only slaveholding presidents were re elected to second terms  1  In addition  southern states benefited by their increased apportionment in Congress due to the partial counting of slaves in their populations  Slave rebellions occurred  including by Gabriel Prosser  1800   Denmark Vesey  1822   and Nat Turner  1831  but they all failed  They led southern states to establish tighter slave oversight as well as reducing rights of free blacks  At the same time  southerners had a growing distrust of Yankees as abolitionists   40  The Supreme Court s 1857 decision in Dred Scott v  Sandford took the Southern position of making slavery legal everywhere  which outraged northerners  Abraham Lincoln with Allan Pinkerton and Major General John Alexander McClernand at the Battle of Antietam  After Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 election  eleven Southern states seceded from the union between late 1860 and 1861  establishing a new government  the Confederate States of America  on February 8  1861  41  Along with the northwestern portion of Virginia  which became West Virginia  four of the five northernmost  slave states  did not secede and became known as the Border States  41  Civil War Further information  American Civil War The Civil War began on April 12  1861  when Confederate forces attacked a U S  military installation at Fort Sumter in South Carolina  42  In response to the attack  on April 15  Lincoln called on the states to send detachments totaling 75 000 troops to recapture forts  protect the capital  and  preserve the Union   which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states  The two armies had their first major clash at the First Battle of Bull Run  which ended in a surprising Union defeat  but  more importantly  proved to both the Union and Confederacy that the war was going to be much longer and bloodier than they had originally anticipated  The war soon divided into two theaters  Eastern and Western  In the western theater  the Union was quite successful  with major battles  such as Perryville  producing strategic Union victories and destroying major Confederate operations  Irish anger at the draft led to the New York Draft Riots of 1863  one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history In the Eastern theater  things did not start well for the Union as the Confederates won at Manassas Junction  Bull Run   just outside Washington  Major General George B  McClellan was put in charge of the Union armies  After reorganizing the new Army of the Potomac  McClellan failed to capture the Confederate capital of Richmond  Virginia in his Peninsula Campaign and retreated after attacks from newly appointed Confederate General Robert E  Lee  Feeling confident in his army after defeating the Union at Second Bull Run  Lee embarked on an invasion of the north that was stopped by McClellan at the bloody Battle of Antietam  Despite this  McClellan was relieved from command for refusing to pursue Lee s crippled army  The next commander  General Ambrose Burnside  suffered a humiliating defeat by Lee s smaller army at the Battle of Fredericksburg late in 1862  causing yet another change in commanders  Lee won again at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863  while losing his top aide  Stonewall Jackson  But Lee pushed too hard and ignored the Union threat in the west  citation needed  Lee invaded Pennsylvania in search of supplies and to cause war weariness in the North  In perhaps the turning point of the war  Lee s army was badly beaten at the Battle of Gettysburg  July 1 3  1863  and barely made it back to Virginia  Battle of Franklin  November 30  1864 Simultaneously on July 4  1863  Union forces under the command of General Ulysses S  Grant gained control of the Mississippi River at the Battle of Vicksburg  thereby splitting the Confederacy  Lincoln made General Grant commander of all Union armies  The last two years of the war was bloody for both sides  with Grant launching a war of attrition against General Lee s Army of Northern Virginia  This war of attrition was divided into three main campaigns  The first of these  the Overland Campaign forced Lee to retreat into the city of Petersburg where Grant launched his second major offensive  the Richmond Petersburg Campaign in which he sieged Petersburg  After a near ten month siege  Petersburg surrendered  However  the defense of Fort Gregg allowed Lee to move his army out of Petersburg  Grant pursued and launched the final  Appomattox Campaign which resulted in Lee surrendering his Army of Northern Virginia on April 9  1865  at Appomattox Court House  41  Other Confederate armies followed suit and the war ended  Based on 1860 census figures  about 8  of all white males aged 13 to 43 died in the war  including about 6  in the North and approximately 18  in the South  43  establishing the American Civil War as the deadliest war in American history  Its legacy includes ending slavery in the United States  restoring the Union  and strengthening the role of the federal government  The social  political  economic and racial issues of the war decisively shaped the Reconstruction era  which lasted through 1877  and brought about changes that would eventually help make the country a united superpower  Reconstruction and a rise in power  1865 1918  Main article  History of the United States  1865 1918  Reconstruction Further information  Reconstruction era of the United States Reconstruction took place for most of the decade following the Civil War  During this era  the  Reconstruction Amendments  were passed to expand civil rights for black Americans  Those amendments included the Thirteenth Amendment  which outlawed slavery  the Fourteenth Amendment that guaranteed citizenship for all people born or naturalized within U S  territory  and the Fifteenth Amendment that granted the vote for all men regardless of race  While the Civil Rights Act of 1875 forbade discrimination in the service of public facilities  the Black Codes denied blacks privileges readily available to whites  44  In response to Reconstruction  the Ku Klux Klan  KKK  emerged around the late 1860s as a white supremacist organization opposed to black civil rights  Congress passed the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1870 and vigorous enforcement closed down the Klan and classified the KKK as a terrorist group  By 1874 other paramilitary groups  such as the White League and Red Shirts organized in numerous chapters in the Deep South  where they acted to suppress black voting and ran Republicans out of office  contributing to Democrats  regaining political power in states across the South during the 1870s  An 1883 Supreme Court decision nullified the Civil Rights Act of 1875 and ended federal efforts to stop private acts of violence designed to suppress legal rights  45  During the era  many regions of the southern U S  were military governed and often corrupt  Reconstruction ended after the disputed 1876 election between Republican candidate Rutherford B  Hayes and Democratic candidate Samuel J  Tilden  With a compromise Hayes won the election  the federal government withdrew its troops from the South  and Southern Democrats soon re entered the national political scene with more power than ever given the addition of freedmen counted fully as citizens  46  By the late nineteenth and early twentieth century  southern states passed new constitutions and voter registration rules that effectively disfranchised black voters  the situation persisted until after the mid 1960s Voting Rights Act and other civil rights legislation provided for enforcement of their rights  Western expansion and Indian wars Completion of the Transcontinental Railroad  1869  at First Transcontinental Railroad  by Andrew J  Russell The latter half of the nineteenth century was marked by the United States  development and settlement of the West  first by wagon trains and then aided by the completion of the transcontinental railroad  and frequent Indian wars as settlers encroached on traditional Native American lands  Gradually the US purchased their lands and extinguished their claims  forcing most tribes onto restricted reservations  According to the U S  Bureau of the Census  1894    The Indian wars under the government of the United States have been more than 40 in number  They have cost the lives of about 19 000 white men  women and children  including those killed in individual combats  and the lives of about 30 000 Indians   47  Gilded Age and Progressivism Further information  Gilded Age and Progressive Era The  Gilded Age  was a term that Mark Twain used to describe the period of the late 19th century when there had been a dramatic expansion of American wealth and prosperity  Reform of the Age included the Civil Service Act  which mandated a competitive examination for applicants for government jobs  Other important legislation included the Interstate Commerce Act  which ended railroads  discrimination against small shippers  and the Sherman Antitrust Act  which outlawed monopolies in business  Twain believed that this age was corrupted by such elements as land speculators  scandalous politics  and unethical business practices  48  By 1890 American industrial production and per capita income exceeded those of all other world nations  In response to heavy debts and decreasing farm prices  wheat and cotton farmers joined the Populist Party  49  An unprecedented wave of immigration from Europe served to both provide the labor for American industry and create diverse communities in previously undeveloped areas  From 1880 to 1914  peak years of immigration  more than 22 million people migrated to the United States  50  The workers  demand for control of their workplace led to the often violent rise of the labor movement in the cities and mining camps  Industrial leaders included John D  Rockefeller in oil and Andrew Carnegie in steel  both became leaders of philanthropy  giving away their fortunes to create the modern system of hospitals  universities  libraries and foundations  Mulberry Street  along which Manhattan s Little Italy is centered  Lower East Side  circa 1900  Almost 97  of residents of the 10 largest American cities of 1900 were non Hispanic whites  51  Dissatisfaction on the part of the growing middle class with the corruption and inefficiency of politics as usual  and the failure to deal with increasingly important urban and industrial problems  led to the dynamic Progressive Movement starting in the 1890s  In every major city and state  and at the national level as well  and in education  medicine  and industry  the progressives called for the modernization and reform of decrepit institutions  the elimination of corruption in politics  and the introduction of efficiency as a criterion for change  Leading politicians from both parties  most notably Theodore Roosevelt  Charles Evans Hughes  and Robert LaFollette on the Republican side  and William Jennings Bryan on the Democratic side  took up the cause of progressive reform  Women became especially involved in demands for woman suffrage  prohibition  and better schools  their most prominent leader was Jane Addams of Chicago  Progressives implemented anti trust laws and regulated such industries of meat packing  drugs  and railroads  Four new constitutional amendments the Sixteenth through Nineteenth resulted from progressive activism  bringing the federal income tax  direct election of Senators  prohibition  and woman suffrage  52  The Progressive Movement lasted through the 1920s  the most active period was 1900 1918  53  Imperialism Further information  American imperialism The United States emerged as a world economic and military power after 1890  The main episode was the Spanish American War  which began when Spain refused American demands to reform its oppressive policies in Cuba  The  splendid little war   as one official called it  involved a series of quick American victories on land and at sea  At the Treaty of Paris peace conference the United States acquired the Philippines  Puerto Rico  and Guam  Cuba became an independent country  under close American tutelage  Although the war itself was widely popular  the peace terms proved controversial  William Jennings Bryan led his Democratic Party in opposition to control of the Philippines  which he denounced as imperialism unbecoming to American democracy  President William McKinley defended the acquisition  and was riding high as the nation had returned to prosperity and felt triumphant in the war  McKinley easily defeated Bryan in a rematch in the 1900 presidential election  After defeating an insurrection by Filipino nationalists  the United States engaged in a large scale program to modernize the economy of the Philippines  and dramatically upgrade the public health facilities  54  By 1908  however  Americans lost interest in an empire  and turned their international attention to the Caribbean  and especially the building of the Panama Canal  The canal opened in 1914  and increased trade with Japan and the rest of the Far East  A key innovation was the Open Door Policy  whereby the imperial powers were given equal access to Chinese business  with no one of them allowed to take control of China  55  World War I Main articles  American entry into World War I and United States home front during World War I American Cemetery at Romagne sous Montfaucon As World War I raged in Europe from 1914  President Woodrow Wilson took full control of foreign policy  declaring neutrality but warning Germany that resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare against American ships would mean war  Germany decided to take the risk and try to win by cutting off Britain  the U S  declared war in April 1917  56  American money  food and munitions arrived quickly  but troops had to be drafted  trained  by summer 1918 American soldiers under General John J  Pershing arrived at the rate of 10 000 a day  while Germany was unable to replace its losses  57  The result was Allied victory in November 1918  President Woodrow Wilson demanded Germany depose the Kaiser and accept his terms  the Fourteen Points  Wilson dominated the 1919 Paris Peace Conference but Germany was treated harshly by the Allies in the Treaty of Versailles  1919  as Wilson put all his hopes in the new League of Nations  Wilson refused to compromise with Senate Republicans over the issue of Congressional power to declare war  and the Senate rejected the Treaty and the League  58  Woman suffrage Further information  Women s suffrage in the United States Alice Paul wrote the Equal Rights Amendment  whose passage would become an important goal of the Women s Liberation Movement half a century later  The women s suffrage movement began with the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention  organized by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott  and the Declaration of Sentiments demanding equal rights for women  Many of the activists became politically aware during the abolitionist movement  The women s rights campaign during  first wave feminism  was led by Mott  Stanton  Susan B  Anthony  among many others  The movement reorganized after the Civil War  gaining experienced campaigners  many of whom had worked for prohibition in the Women s Christian Temperance Union  By the end of the 19th century a few western states had granted women full voting rights  59  though women had made significant legal victories  gaining rights in areas such as property and child custody  60  Around 1912 the feminist movement  which had grown sluggish  began to reawaken  putting an emphasis on its demands for equality and arguing that the corruption of American politics demanded purification by women  because men could not do that job  61  Protests became increasingly common as suffragette Alice Paul led parades through the capital and major cities  Paul split from the large National American Woman Suffrage Association  NAWSA   which favored a more moderate approach and supported the Democratic Party and Woodrow Wilson  led by Carrie Chapman Catt  and formed the more militant National Woman s Party  Suffragists were arrested during their  Silent Sentinels  pickets at the White House  the first time such a tactic was used  and were taken as political prisoners  62  Finally  the suffragettes were ordered released from prison  and Wilson urged Congress to pass a Constitutional amendment enfranchising women  The old anti suffragist argument that only men could fight a war  and therefore only men deserve the right to vote  was refuted by the enthusiastic participation of tens of thousands of American women on the home front in World War I  Across the world  grateful nations gave women the right to vote  Furthermore  most of the Western states had already given the women the right to vote in state and national elections  and the representatives from those states  including the first woman Jeannette Rankin of Montana  demonstrated that woman suffrage was a success  The main resistance came from the south  where white leaders were worried about the threat of black women voting  Nevertheless Congress passed the Nineteenth Amendment in 1919  It became constitutional law on August 26  1920  after ratification by the 36th required state  63  NAWSA became the League of Women Voters and the National Woman s Party began lobbying for full equality and the Equal Rights Amendment which would pass Congress during the second wave of the women s movement in 1972  Politicians responded to the new electorate by emphasizing issues of special interest to women  especially prohibition  child health  and world peace  64  65  The main surge of women voting came in 1928  when the big city machines realized they needed the support of women to elect Al Smith  while rural organizations mobilized women to support Prohibition and vote for Republican Herbert Hoover  66  Roaring Twenties  the Great Depression  and World War II  1918 1945  Main article  History of the United States  1918 1945  Prohibition agents destroying barrels of alcohol in Chicago  1921 Following World War I  the U S  grew steadily in stature as an economic and military world power  The United States Senate did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles imposed by its Allies on the defeated Central Powers  instead  the United States chose to pursue unilateralism  if not isolationism  67  The aftershock of Russia s October Revolution resulted in real fears of communism in the United States  leading to a three year Red Scare  In 1918 the U S  lost 675 000 people to the Spanish flu pandemic  68  In 1920  the manufacture  sale  import and export of alcohol were prohibited by the Eighteenth Amendment  Prohibition encouraged illegal breweries and dealers to make substantial amounts of money selling alcohol illegally  The Prohibition ended in 1933  a failure  Additionally  the KKK re formed during that decade and gathered nearly 4 5 million members by 1924  and the U S  government passed the Immigration Act of 1924 restricting foreign immigration  69  The 1920s were also known as the Roaring Twenties  due to the great economic prosperity during this period  citation needed Jazz became popular among the younger generation  and thus was also called the Jazz Age  Great Depression and New Deal Further information  Great Depression Dorothea Lange s Migrant Mother depicts destitute pea pickers in California  centering on a mother of seven  age 32  in Nipomo  California  March 1936  During most of the 1920s  the United States enjoyed a period of unbalanced prosperity  farm prices and wages fell  while new industries and industrial profits grew  The boom was fueled by an inflated stock market  which later led to the Stock Market Crash on October 29  1929  70  This  along with many other economic factors  triggered a worldwide depression known as the Great Depression  During this time  the United States experienced deflation  unemployment soared from 3  in 1929 to 25  in 1933  and manufacturing output collapsed by one third  In 1932  Democratic presidential nominee Franklin D  Roosevelt promised  a New Deal for the American people   coining the enduring label for his domestic policies  The desperate economic situation  along with the substantial Democratic victories in the 1932 elections  gave Roosevelt unusual influence over Congress in the  First Hundred Days  of his administration  He used his leverage to win rapid passage of a series of measures to create welfare programs and regulate the banking system  stock market  industry and agriculture  along with many other government efforts to end the Great Depression and reform the American economy  The New Deal regulated much of the economy  especially the financial sector  It provided relief to the unemployed through numerous programs  such as the Works Progress Administration  WPA  and  for young men  the Civilian Conservation Corps  Large scale spending projects designed to provide high paying jobs and rebuild the infrastructure were under the purview of the Public Works Administration  Roosevelt turned left in 1935 36  building up labor unions through the Wagner Act  Unions became a powerful element of the merging New Deal Coalition  which won reelection for FDR in 1936  1940 and 1944 by mobilizing union members  blue collar workers  relief recipients  big city machines  ethnic groups  especially Catholics and Jews  and the white South  along with blacks in the North  where they could vote   Many of the programs were dropped in the 1940s when the conservatives regained power in Congress through the Conservative Coalition  Of special importance is the Social Security program  begun in 1935  71  World War II The Japanese hoped to cripple American naval power in the Pacific with the attack on Pearl Harbor  a naval base in Hawaii  Further information  World War II and United States home front during World War II In the Depression years the United States remained focused on domestic concerns while democracy declined across the world and many countries fell under the control of dictators  Imperial Japan asserted dominance in East Asia and in the Pacific  Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy militarized to and threatened conquests  while Britain and France attempted appeasement to avert another war in Europe  U S  legislation in the Neutrality Acts sought to avoid foreign conflicts  however policy clashed with increasing anti Nazi feelings following the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 that started World War II  Roosevelt positioned the U S  as the  Arsenal of Democracy  pledging full scale financial and munitions support for the Allies but no soldiers  72  Japan tried to neutralize America s power in the Pacific by attacking Pearl Harbor on December 7  1941  which catalyzed American support to enter the war and seek revenge  73  The main contributions of the U S  to the Allied war effort comprised money  industrial output  food  petroleum  technological innovation  and  especially 1944 45   soldiers  Much of the focus in Washington was maximizing the economic output of the nation  The overall result was a dramatic increase in GDP  the export of vast quantities of supplies to the Allies and to American forces overseas  the end of unemployment  and a rise in civilian consumption even as 40  of the GDP went to the war effort  This was achieved by tens of millions of workers moving from low productivity occupations to high efficiency jobs  improvements in productivity through better technology and management  and the move into the active labor force of students  retired people  housewives  and the unemployed  and an increase in hours worked  It was exhausting  leisure activities declined sharply  People tolerated the extra work because of patriotism  the pay  and the confidence it was only  for the duration  and life would return to normal as soon as the war was won  Most durable goods became unavailable  and meat  clothing  and gasoline were tightly rationed  In industrial areas housing was in short supply as people doubled up and lived in cramped quarters  Prices and wages were controlled  and Americans saved a high portion of their incomes  which led to renewed growth after the war instead of a return to depression  74  75  American corpses sprawled on the beach of Tarawa  November 1943  The Allies  the U S   Britain and the Soviet Union  as well as China  Canada and other countries fought the Axis powers of Germany  Italy  and Japan  The Allies saw Germany as the main threat  and gave highest priority to Europe  The U S  dominated the war against Japan  and stopped Japanese expansion in the Pacific in 1942  After losing to the Japanese Pearl Harbor and in the Philippines  and drawing the Battle of the Coral Sea  May 1942   the American Navy inflicted a decisive blow at Midway  June 1942   American ground forces assisted in the North African Campaign that eventually concluded with the collapse of Mussolini s fascist government in 1943  as Italy switched to the Allied side  A more significant European front was opened on D Day  June 6  1944  in which American and Allied forces invaded Nazi occupied France from Britain  Into the Jaws of Death  The Normandy landings began the Allied march toward Germany from the west  On the home front  mobilization of the U S  economy was managed by Roosevelt s War Production Board  The wartime production boom led to full employment  wiping out this vestige of the Great Depression  Indeed  labor shortages encouraged industry to look for new sources of workers  finding new roles for women and blacks  76  However the fervor also inspired anti Japanese sentiment  which responded by removing everyone of Japanese descent from the West Coast war zone  77 Research and development took flight as well  best seen in the Manhattan Project  a secret effort to harness nuclear fission to produce highly destructive atomic bombs  78  The Allied pushed the Germans out of France  but faced an unexpected counterattack at the Battle of the Bulge in December  The final German effort failed  and as 1945 opened Allied armies in East and West were converging on Berlin  as the Nazis hurriedly tried to kill the last remaining Jews  The western front stopped short  leaving Berlin to the Soviets as the Nazi regime formally capitulated in May 1945  ending the war in Europe  79  Over in the Pacific  the U S  implemented an island

81  The U S  occupied Japan  and part of Germany   sending Douglas MacArthur to restructure the Japanese economy and political system along American lines  82  Though the nation lost more than 400 000 soldiers  83  the mainland prospered untouched by the devastation of war that inflicted a heavy toll on Europe and Asia  Participation in postwar foreign affairs marked the end of predominant American isolationism  The awesome threat of nuclear weapons inspired both optimism and fear  Nuclear weapons were never used after 1945  as both sides drew back from the brink and a  long peace  characterized the Cold War years  1947 1991  There were  however  regional wars in Korea and Vietnam  84  The Cold War begins  1945 1964  Main article  History of the United States  1945 1964  President Kennedy s Civil Rights Address  June 11  1963  Following World War II  the United States emerged as one of the two dominant superpowers  The U S  Senate on a bipartisan vote approved U S  participation in the United Nations  UN   which marked a turn away from the traditional isolationism of the U S  and toward increased international involvement  The primary American goal of 1945 48 was to rescue Europe from the devastation of World War II and to contain the expansion of Communism  represented by the Soviet Union  The Truman Doctrine of 1947 provided military and economic aid to Greece and Turkey to counteract the threat of Communist expansion in the Balkans  In 1948  the United States replaced piecemeal financial aid programs with a comprehensive Marshall Plan  which pumped money into the economy of Western Europe  and removed trade barriers  while modernizing the managerial practices of businesses and governments  The Plan s  13 billion budget was in the context of a U S  GDP of  258 billion in 1948  and was on top of  12 billion in American aid to Europe between the end of the war and the start of the Marshall Plan  Soviet head of state Joseph Stalin prevented his satellites from participating  and from that point on Eastern Europe  with inefficient centralized economies  fell further and further behind Western Europe in terms of economic development and prosperity  In 1949  the United States  rejecting the long standing policy of no military alliances in peacetime  formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO  alliance  which continues into the 21st century  In response the Soviets formed the Warsaw Pact of communist states  85  In August 1949 the Soviets tested their first nuclear weapon  thereby escalating the risk of warfare  Indeed  the threat of mutually assured destruction prevented both powers from going too far  and resulted in proxy wars  especially in Korea and Vietnam  in which the two sides did not directly confront each other  84  Within the United States  the Cold War prompted concerns about Communist influence  The unexpected leapfrogging of American technology by the Soviets in 1957 with Sputnik  the first Earth satellite  began the Space Race  won by the Americans as Apollo 11 landed astronauts on the moon in 1969  The angst about the weaknesses of American education led to large scale federal support for science education and research  86  In the decades after World War II  the United States became a global influence in economic  political  military  cultural  and technological affairs  Beginning in the 1950s  middle class culture became obsessed with consumer goods  White Americans made up nearly 90  of the population in 1950  87  clarification needed  In 1960  the charismatic politician John F  Kennedy was elected as the first and thus far only Roman Catholic President of the United States  The Kennedy family brought a new life and vigor to the atmosphere of the White House  His time in office was marked by such notable events as the acceleration of the United States  role in the Space Race  escalation of the American role in the Vietnam War  the Cuban missile crisis  the Bay of Pigs Invasion  the jailing of Martin Luther King  Jr  during the Birmingham campaign  and the appointment of his brother Robert F  Kennedy to his Cabinet as Attorney General  Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas  Texas  on November 22  1963  leaving the nation in profound shock  88  Climax of liberalism The climax of liberalism came in the mid 1960s with the success of President Lyndon B  Johnson  1963 69  in securing congressional passage of his Great Society programs  including civil rights  the end of segregation  Medicare  extension of welfare  federal aid to education at all levels  subsidies for the arts and humanities  environmental activism  and a series of programs designed to wipe out poverty  89  90  As recent historians have explained   Gradually  liberal intellectuals crafted a new vision for achieving economic and social justice  The liberalism of the early 1960s contained no hint of radicalism  little disposition to revive new deal era crusades against concentrated economic power  and no intention to fast and class passions or redistribute wealth or restructure existing institutions  Internationally it was strongly anti Communist  It aimed to defend the free world  to encourage economic growth at home  and to ensure that the resulting plenty was fairly distributed  Their agenda much influenced by Keynesian economic theory envisioned massive public expenditure that would speed economic growth  thus providing the public resources to fund larger welfare  housing  health  and educational programs   91  Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King  Jr   22 June 1963  Washington  D C  Johnson was rewarded with an electoral landslide in 1964 against conservative Barry Goldwater  which broke the decades long control of Congress by the Conservative coalition  But the Republicans bounced back in 1966 and elected Richard Nixon in 1968  Nixon largely continued the New Deal and Great Society programs he inherited  conservative reaction would come with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980  Meanwhile  the American people completed a great migration from farms into the cities and experienced a period of sustained economic expansion  At the same time  institutionalized racism across the United States  but especially in the South  was increasingly challenged by the growing Civil Rights movement  The activism of African American leaders Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King  Jr  led to the Montgomery Bus Boycott  which launched the movement  For years African Americans would struggle with violence against them  but would achieve great steps towards equality with Supreme Court decisions  including Brown v  Board of Education and Loving v  Virginia  the Civil Rights Act of 1964  the Voting Rights Act of 1965  and the Fair Housing Act of 1968  which ended the Jim Crow laws that legalized racial segregation between Whites and Blacks  Martin Luther King  Jr   who had won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to achieve equality of the races  was assassinated in 1968  Following his death others led the movement  most notably King s widow  Coretta Scott King  who was also active  like her husband  in the Opposition to the Vietnam War  and in the Women s Liberation Movement  Over the first nine months of 1967  128 American cities suffered 164 riots  92  The late 1960s and early 1970s saw the strengthening of Black Power  however the decade would ultimately bring about positive strides toward integration  The Women s Movement Further information  Second wave feminism Gloria Steinem at a meeting of the Women s Action Alliance  1972  A new consciousness of the inequality of American women began sweeping the nation  starting with the 1963 publication of Betty Friedan s best seller  The Feminine Mystique  which explained how many housewives felt trapped and unfulfilled  assaulted American culture for its creation of the notion that women could only find fulfillment through their roles as wives  mothers  and keepers of the home  and argued that women were just as able as men to do every type of job  In 1966 Friedan and others established the National Organization for Women  or NOW  to act for women as the NAACP did for African Americans  60  93  Protests began  and the new Women s Liberation Movement grew in size and power  gained much media attention  and  by 1968  had replaced the Civil Rights Movement as the U S  s main social revolution  Marches  parades  rallies  boycotts  and pickets brought out thousands  sometimes millions  Friedan s Women s Strike for Equality  1970  was a nation wide success  The Movement was split into factions by political ideology early on  however  with NOW on the left  the Women s Equity Action League  WEAL  on the right  the National Women s Political Caucus  NWPC  in the center  and more radical groups formed by younger women on the far left   Along with Friedan  Gloria Steinem was an important feminist leader  co founding the NWPC  the Women s Action Alliance

introduced a complicated missile defense system known as the Strategic Defense Initiative  dubbed  Star Wars  by opponents  in which  theoretically  the U S  could shoot down missiles with laser systems in space  Though it was never fully developed or deployed  105  the Soviets were genuinely concerned about the possible effects of the program 106  and the research and technologies of SDI paved the way for the anti ballistic missile systems of today  107  The Reagan administration also provided covert funding and assistance to anti Communist resistance movements worldwide  Reagan s interventions against Grenada and Libya were popular in the U S   though his backing of the Contra rebels was mired in controversy  108  The arms for hostages scandal led to the convictions of such figures as Oliver North and John Poindexter  109  Reagan met four times with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev  who ascended to power in 1985  and their summit conferences led to the signing of the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty  Gorbachev tried to save Communism in the Soviet Union first by ending the expensive arms race with America  110  then by shedding the East European empire in 1989  The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991  ending the U S  Soviet Cold War  World superpower  1991 present  Main article  History of the United States  1991 present  The NASDAQ Composite index swelled with the dot com bubble in the optimistic  New Economy   The bubble burst in 2000  The United States emerged as the world s sole remaining superpower and continued to intervene in international affairs during the 1990s  including the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq  Following his election in 1992  President Bill Clinton oversaw one of the longest periods of economic expansion and unprecedented gains in securities values  a side effect of the digital revolution and new business opportunities created by the Internet  He also worked with the Republican Congress to pass the first balanced federal budget in 30 years  In 1998  Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives on charges of  high crimes and misdemeanors  for lying about a sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky  but was later acquitted by the Senate  The failure of impeachment and the Democratic gains in the 1998 election forced House Speaker Newt Gingrich  a Republican  to resign from Congress  111  The presidential election in 2000 between George W  Bush and Al Gore was one of the closest in U S  history  and helped lay the seeds for political polarization to come  The vote in the decisive state of Florida was extremely close and produced a dramatic dispute over the counting of votes  The U S  Supreme Court in Bush v  Gore ended the recount with a 5 4 vote  That meant Bush  then in the lead  carried Florida and the election  112  9 11 and the War on Terror The September 11 attacks led to the War on Terror  Once again the United States was attacked by terrorism with the September 11  2001 attacks  9 11  in which al Qaeda terrorists hijacked four transcontinental airliners and intentionally crashed two of them into the twin towers of the World Trade Center and one into the Pentagon killing 3 000 people  113  President George W  Bush announced a  War on Terror  in response  The United States and NATO launched an invasion of Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban regime that had harbored al Qaeda and its leader Osama bin Laden  The federal government established new domestic efforts to prevent future attacks  The controversial USA PATRIOT Act increased government s power to monitor communications and removed legal restrictions on information sharing between federal law enforcement and intelligence services  A cabinet level agency called the Department of Homeland Security was created to lead and coordinate federal counter terrorism activities  114  Some of these anti terrorism efforts  particularly the U S  government s handling of detainees at the prison at Guantanamo Bay  led to allegations toward the U S  government of human rights violations  115  In 2003  the United States launched an invasion of Iraq  which led to the collapse of the Iraqi government and the eventual capture of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein  with whom the U S  had long standing tense relations  The reasons for the invasion cited by the Bush administration included the spreading of democracy  the elimination of weapons of mass destruction 116   a key demand of the UN as well  though later investigations found parts of the intelligence reports to be inaccurate  117  and the liberation of the Iraqi people  Despite some initial successes early in the invasion  the continued Iraq War fueled international protests and gradually saw domestic support decline as many people began to question whether or not the invasion was worth the cost  118  119  In 2007  after years of violence by the Iraqi insurgency  President Bush deployed more troops in a strategy dubbed  the surge   While the death toll decreased  the political stability of Iraq remained in doubt  120  In 2008  the unpopularity of President Bush and the Iraq war  along with the 2008 financial crisis  led to the election of Barack Obama  the first African American President of the United States  After he took office  Obama began to decrease troop levels in Iraq  and officially ended combat operations in the country on August 31  2010  He kept 50 000 in Iraq to assist Iraqi forces  help protect withdrawing forces  and work on counter terrorism until December 2011  when the war was declared formally over and the last troops left the country  121  122  123  At the same time  Obama increased American involvement in Afghanistan  starting a surge strategy using an additional 30 000 troops  while proposing to begin withdrawing troops in July 2011  124  In May 2011  after nearly a decade in hiding  Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan by U S  armed forces acting under President Obama s direct orders  125  Recent events Lehman Brothers  headquarters pictured  filed for bankruptcy in September 2008 at the height of the U S  financial crisis  In December 2007  the United States  and most of Europe  entered the longest post World War II recession  126  which included a housing market crisis  a subprime mortgage crisis  soaring oil prices  127  an automotive industry crisis  rising unemployment  and the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression  128  129  130  The financial crisis hit a critical point in September 2008 when Lehman Brothers and other important financial institutions failed  131  Starting the following month the federal government lent  245 billion to financial institutions through the Troubled Asset Relief Program  132  which was signed into law under the Bush administration  133  Shortly after taking office  President Obama signed into law a  787 billion economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening recession  In addition to the economic stimulus  the government took steps to rescue the auto industry and prevent future economic meltdowns  These included a bailout of General Motors and Chrysler  putting ownership temporarily in the hands of the government  and the  cash for clunkers  program which temporarily boosted new car sales  134  Congress enacted the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act  a bill that makes sweeping changes to the financial regulatory system  135  In June 2009  the recession officially ended and the U S  economy began to expand once again  136  The unemployment rate peaked at 10 1  in October  followed by a slow economic recovery  137  The beginning of the 2010s saw the rise of various social and political movements across the world  such as the conservative Tea Party movement in the U S   the international populist Occupy movement and the pro democratic Arab Spring movement in the Middle East  The 111th Congress saw the passage of major legislation such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Don t Ask  Don t Tell Repeal Act  which were signed into law by President Obama  Some of these bills were controversial and ran into heated Republican opposition in Congress  In the 2010 midterm elections  the Republicans regained control of the House and installed John Boehner as Speaker  and they also made some gains in the Senate   138  139  140  The new divided Congress presided over a period of elevated gridlock and heated debates over whether or not raise the debt ceiling and whether or not to extend tax cuts for citizens making less than  250 000 annually  141  As a result of growing public frustration with both parties in Congress  their approval rating fell to an all time low of 11   142  As of January 2012  debates continue over the economy  the 8 5  unemployment rate  economic inequality  deficit spending  health care reform  the financial crisis in state government  the role of corporate spending in election campaigns  143  and U S  involvement in Afghanistan  See also
