the Gaza Strip  politically under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian National Authority and the Hamas Government in Gaza  Since the Palestinian Declaration of Independence in 1988  the region is today recognized by three quarters of the world s countries to be part of the State of Palestine  4  although this status is not recognized by the United Nations  Israel and major Western nations  including the United States  Effectively parts of the West Bank are currently governed by the Palestinian National Authority  while other parts are governed by Israeli military authorities  which the UN and international legal bodies often refer to as the Occupied Palestinian Territories  The Gaza Strip is being controlled by Hamas led Palestinian Government  The territories were part of the territory west of the Jordan River of Mandate Palestine  formed in 1922  In March 1946  the territory east of the Jordan River  which had been ruled as a separate province of Mandate Palestine  became the independent kingdom of Transjordan  though general international recognition took a bit longer  From the 1948 Arab Israeli War until the 1967 Six Day War  the West Bank was occupied and annexed by Jordan  annexation recognized only by UK and Pakistan  and the Gaza Strip occupied by Egypt  though limited authority was exercised in Gaza by the All Palestine Government until 1959  The borders of Palestinian territories are currently considered to be delineated by the 1949 Armistice Agreements  5  Since 1967 and until the establishment of the Palestinian National Authority in 1993  the territories became occupied by Israel  and effectively the term Occupied Palestinian territories was coined  In 1980 Israel annexed East Jerusalem  but United Nations Security Council Resolution 478 declared it  null and void  and required that it be rescinded  stating that it was a violation of international law  The annexation lacks international recognition  6  After losing it in 1967  Jordan renounced all territorial claims to East Jerusalem and the West Bank in 1988  In 1993  parts of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank were transferred to the administration of the Palestinian National Authority  becoming Palestinian territories  In 2005  Israel pulled out all its remaining forces of Gaza Strip and dismantled its settlements  Yet  both West Bank and Gaza Strip are currently considered to be occupied by Israel according to the international community  although Israel has denied that it occupies the Gaza Strip  7  6  8  The Palestinian National Authority regards East Jerusalem as part of the West Bank  and consequently a part of the Palestinian territories  while Israel regards it as part of Israel as a result of its annexation in 1980  According to the Israeli Supreme Court  the Fourth Geneva Convention  which prohibits unilateral annexation of occupied territory  does not apply to East Jerusalem  as there was no  legitimate sovereign  there prior  citation needed  The Palestinian National Authority  which maintains a territorial claim to East Jerusalem  never exercised sovereignty over the area  However  this reasoning has not been recognized by any other country  since unilateral annexation of territory conquered during war contravenes the Fourth Geneva Convention  9  10  The Hamas takeover of Gaza politically divided the Palestinian territories  with Abbas s Fatah left largely ruling the West Bank and recognized internationally as the official Palestinian Authority  11  while Hamas has secured its control over the Gaza Strip  In April 2011  the Palestinian parties signed an agreement of reconciliation  but its implementation has stalled since  11  Contents 1 Name 2 Boundaries 3 History 4 Political status 5 Legal status 6 Governorates structure 7 See also 8 References 9 External links  edit  Name See also  Timeline of the name Palestine There are disagreements over what the Palestinian territories should be called  The United Nations  the International Court of Justice  the European Union  International Committee of the Red Cross and the government of the United Kingdom all refer to the  Occupied Palestinian Territories   12  13  14  Journalists also use the description to indicate lands outside the Green Line  citation needed  The term is often used interchangeably with the term occupied territories  although this term is also applied to the Golan Heights  which is internationally recognized as part of Syria and not claimed by the Palestinians  The confusion stems from the fact that all these territories were captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day War and are treated by the UN as territory occupied by Israel  Other terms used to describe these areas collectively include  the disputed territories    Israeli occupied territories   and  the occupied territories   Further terms include  Yesha   Judea Samaria Gaza   Yosh  Judea and Samaria   the Katif Strip  Gaza Strip    administered territories    territories of undetermined permanent status    1967 territories   and simply  the territories   Many Arab and Islamic leaders  who   including some Palestinians  who   use the designation  Palestine  and  occupied Palestine  to imply a Palestinian political or religious claim to sovereignty over the whole former territory of the British Mandate west of the Jordan River  including all of Israel  15  Many who   of them view the land of Palestine as an Islamic Waqf  trust  for future Muslim generations  A parallel exists in the aspirations of David Ben Gurion  16  Menachem Begin  17  18  and other Zionists and Jewish religious leaders who   to establish Jewish sovereignty over all of Greater Israel in trust for the Jewish people  19  20  However  this dispute is not related to religion for many Arabs  but simply an issue of rights  as the land was inhabited by Arabs  as well as a minority of Jews  before the Zionist movement began  Many Israelis who   object to the term  Occupied Palestinian Territories   and similar descriptions  because they maintain such designations disregard Israeli claims to the West Bank and Gaza  or prejudice negotiations involving possible border changes  arguing that the armistice line agreed to after the 1948 Arab Israeli War was not intended as a permanent border  Dore Gold wrote   It would be far more accurate to describe the West Bank and Gaza Strip as  disputed territories  to which both Israelis and Palestinians have claims   21   edit  Boundaries See also  Borders of Israel Map of the Gaza Strip The Palestinian Territories consist of two  or perhaps three  distinct areas  the Gaza Strip  the West Bank and East Jerusalem  Israel regards East Jerusalem not to be a part of the West Bank  but regards it is as part of a unified Jerusalem  which it unilaterally considers the capital of the state  The eastern limit of the West Bank is the border with Jordan  The Israel Jordan peace treaty defined that border as the international border  and Jordan renounced all claims to territory west of it  The border segment between Jordan and the West Bank was left undefined pending a definitive agreement on the status of the territory  22  The southern limit of the Gaza Strip is the border with Egypt  Egypt renounced all claims to land north of the international border  including the Gaza Strip  in the Israel Egypt peace treaty  The Palestinians were not parties to either agreement  The natural geographic boundary of the West Bank  as the name implies  is the Jordan River  The Gaza Strip is bounded by the Mediterranean Sea  Map of the West Bank It is now generally accepted  at least as a basis for negotiation between the sides  that the boundaries between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and the State of Israel are what has historically been referred to as the Green Line  citation needed  The Green Line represents the armistice lines under the 1949 Armistice Agreements  which brought an end to the 1948 Arab Israeli War and expressly declared armistice lines  not international borders  Between the Armistice of 1949 and the Six Day War of 1967  the West Bank and East Jerusalem were occupied and annexed by Jordan and the Gaza Strip was occupied  but not annexed  by Egypt  The term  Palestinian  began to be applied exclusively to the Arab population of these areas only after Israel s victory in the 1967 War  and consequently the terms  Palestinian Territories  and  Occupied Palestinian Territories  also gained wide usage  Until the start of serious negotiations for a settlement of the Israeli Palestinian issues  the Peace Process   the Palestinians refrained from defining the boundaries of what they called  the occupied territories   and which some even called  occupied Palestine   which implied a potential Palestinian claim to the whole of Israel  It was in the context of the negotiations that the term  1967 borders  came to be used  as a basis for negotiation   The 1967 borders  are in fact the 1949 armistice lines  which is the Green Line   which all Arab countries and Palestinians at the time insisted were to be temporary and with no other legal status  The Palestinian negotiators claim a return to those lines as the boundary for a future Palestinian state  The Palestinians also claim that East Jerusalem is a part of the occupied West Bank within the boundaries of the  1967 borders   The Arab League has supported these boundaries as the borders of the future State of Palestine in the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative   edit  History Main article  History of Palestine  region

under the armistice of 1949      Arab territory from 1949 to 1967        Israel in the 1949 armistice lines  In 1922 after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire that ruled Greater Syria for four centuries  1517 1917   the British Mandate for Palestine was established  Large scale Jewish immigration from abroad  mainly from Eastern Europe took place during the British Mandate  though Jewish immigration started during the Ottoman period  23  24  The future of Palestine was hotly disputed between Arabs and Jews  In 1947  the total Jewish ownership of land in Palestine was 1 850 000 dunams or 1 850 square kilometers  which is 7 04  of the total land of Palestine  25  Public property or  crown lands   the bulk of which was in the Negev  belonging to the government of Palestine may have made up as much as 70  of the total land  with the Arabs  Christians and others owning the rest  26  The 1947 United Nations Partition Plan proposed a division of Mandate Palestine between an Arab and a Jewish state  with Jerusalem and the surrounding area to be a corpus separatum under a special international regime  The regions allotted to the proposed Arab state included what became the Gaza Strip  and almost all of what became the West Bank  as well as other areas  The Partition Plan was passed by the UN General Assembly on November 1947  The Partition Plan was accepted by the Jewish leadership  but rejected by the Arab leaders  The Arab League threatened to take military measures to prevent the partition of Palestine and to ensure the national rights of the Palestinian Arab population  One day before the expiration of the British Mandate for Palestine  on 14 May 1948  Israel declared its independence within the borders of the Jewish State set out in the Partition Plan  US President Harry Truman recognized the State of Israel de facto the following day  The Arab countries declared war on the newly formed State of Israel heralding the start of the 1948 Arab Israeli War  After the war  which Palestinians call the Nakba  the 1949 Armistice Agreements established the separation lines between the combatants  leaving Israel in control of some of the areas designated for the Arab state under the Partition Plan  Transjordan in control of the West Bank and East Jerusalem  Egypt in control of the Gaza Strip and Syria in control of the Himmah Area  In 1950 Jordan annexed the West Bank and East Jerusalem  Only the United Kingdom formally recognized the annexation of the West Bank  de facto in the case of East Jerusalem  27  In the Gaza Strip the Arab League formed the All Palestine Government  which operated under Egypt occupation  Article 24 of the Palestinian National Charter of 1964  which established the Palestine Liberation Organization  28  stated   This Organization does not exercise any territorial sovereignty over the West Bank in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan  on the Gaza Strip or in the Himmah Area   i e  the areas of the former Mandate Palestine controlled by Jordan  Egypt and Syria  respectively   Israel captured both territories in the 1967 Six Day War  besides other territory belonging to Egypt and Syria  Since then these territories have been designated Israeli occupied territories  Immediately after the war  on June 19  1967  the Israeli government offered to return the Golan Heights to Syria  the Sinai to Egypt and most of the West Bank to Jordan in exchange for peace  At the Khartoum Summit in September  the Arab parties responded to this overture by declaring  no peace with Israel  no recognition of Israel and no negotiations with Israel   29  UN Security Council Resolution 242 introduced the  Land for Peace  formula for normalizing relations between Israel and its neighbors  This formula was used when Israel returned the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt in 1979 in exchange for a peace treaty  While that treaty mentioned a  linkage  between Israeli Egyptian peace and Palestinian autonomy  the formerly Egyptian occupied territory in Gaza was excluded from the agreement  and remained under Israeli control  The Oslo Accords of the early 1990s between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority  This was an interim organization created to administer a limited form of Palestinian self governance in the territories for a period of five years during which final status negotiations would take place  The Palestinian Authority carried civil responsibility in some rural areas  as well as security responsibility in the major cities of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip  Although the five year interim period expired in 1999  the final status agreement has yet to be concluded despite attempts such as the 2000 Camp David Summit  the Taba summit  and the unofficial Geneva Accords  In 2005  Israeli forces withdrew from the Gaza Strip  ceding full effective internal control of the territory to the Palestinian Authority  Since the Battle of Gaza  2007  the two separate territories  the Gaza Strip and the West Bank  are divided into a Hamas leadership in the Gaza Strip and a Fatah civil leadership in the autonomous areas of the West Bank  Each sees itself as the administrator of all Palestinian Territories and does not acknowledge the other one as the official government of the territories  The Palestinian Territories have therefore de facto split into two entities   edit  Political status Main articles  Palestinian National Authority and Governance of the Gaza Strip The political status of the territories has been the subject of negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization  PLO  and of numerous statements and resolutions by the United Nations   See List of United Nations resolutions concerning Israel   Since 1994  the autonomous Palestinian National Authority has exercised various degrees of control in large parts of the territories  as a result of the Declaration of Principles contained in the Oslo Accords  The United States government considers the West Bank and Gaza as a single entity for political  economic  legal and other purposes  30  The State Department and other US government agencies  such as USAID West Bank and Gaza  31  have been tasked with projects in the areas of democracy  governance  resources  and infrastructure  Part of the USAID mission is to provide flexible and discrete support for implementation of the Quartet Road Map  32  The Road Map is an internationally backed plan that calls for the progressive development of a viable Palestinian State in the West Bank and Gaza  Participating states provide assistance through direct contributions or through the Palestinian State account established by the World Bank  33  Panorama of Gaza City After Hamas won a majority of seats in elections for the Palestinian Parliament  the United States and Israel instituted an economic blockade of the Gaza Strip  34  35  When that failed to topple the new government  a covert operation was launched to eliminate Hamas by force  36  37  38  The covert initiative was exposed when confidential State Department documents were accidentally leaked by the US envoy  The talking points delivered to the Fatah leadership said  Hamas should be given a clear choice  with a clear deadline  they either accept a new government that meets the Quartet principles  or they reject it  The consequences of Hamas  decision should also be clear  If Hamas does not agree within the prescribed time  you should make clear your intention to declare a state of emergency and form an emergency government explicitly committed to that platform  39  Since the Battle of Gaza  2007   the administration of the territories has been contested by two rival factions of the Palestinian National Authority  with Hamas controlling the Gaza Strip and Fatah continuing to administer the West Bank  Both groups claim legitimacy over leadership of the Palestinian territories  Most countries with an interest in the issues  including most of the Arab countries  recognize the administration of Mahmoud Abbas as the legitimate government over both Palestinian Territories  who   During Operation Cast Lead the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1860  2009   which said that the Gaza Strip constitutes an integral part of the territory occupied in 1967 that will be a part of the Palestinian state  40  On 15 December 2011  Iceland recognized Palestine as an independent and sovereign state within the pre 1967 Six Day War borders   ssur Skarph  insson  Minister for Foreign

regards the West Bank and East Jerusalem as territories occupied by Israel  and  although it has withdrawn its military forces  Israel continues to be designated the occupying power in the Gaza Strip by the United Nations  the United States  the United Kingdom and various human rights organizations  42  43  However  the co founder of Hamas  Mahmoud Zahar  has stated that Gaza is no longer occupied since the Israeli withdrawal  44  The final status of the Palestinian Territories as an independent state is supported by the countries that form the Quartet s  Road map for peace   The government of Israel has also accepted the road map but with 14 reservations  45  Customary international law  including the Fourth Geneva Convention  has been widely interpreted as prohibiting Israel from building settlements  due to its clauses prohibiting the transfer of a civilian population into an occupied territory  46  This was reaffirmed December 5  2001  at the Conference of High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention  The participating High Contracting Parties called upon Israel  to fully and effectively respect the Fourth Geneva Convention in the Occupied Palestinian Territory  including East Jerusalem  and to refrain from perpetrating any violation of the Convention  They reaffirm the illegality of the settlements in the said territories and of the extension thereof   42  Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits any change of status in occupied territory concluded through negotiations between the occupying power and local authorities under occupation  Critics point out that implementation of the Oslo Accords has not improved conditions for the population under occupation  47  Israel contends that the settlements are not illegal as the West Bank is considered a  disputed territory  under international law  United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 recognized Israel s rights to  safe and secure borders   which has been interpreted as meaning that Israel had a right to West Bank territory for secure borders  The San Remo Conference  binding under international law  further envisioned the West Bank as being part of a sovereign Jewish state  and arguably encourages  rather than prohibits Jewish settlement in the area  Furthermore  many of the settlements were established on the sites of former Jewish communities that had existed there prior to 1947 on land that was legitimately bought  and ethnically cleansed by Arab forces  Israel views the territory as being the subject of legitimate diplomatic dispute and negotiation under international law  48  49 East Jerusalem  captured in 1967  was unilaterally annexed by Israel  The UN Security Council Resolution 478 condemned the annexation as  a violation of international law   This annexation has not been recognized by other nations  although the United States Congress declared its intention to recognize the annexation  a proposal that has been condemned by other states and organizations   Because of the question of Jerusalem s status  no states base their diplomatic missions there and treat Tel Aviv as the capital  50  though two states have embassies in the Jerusalem suburb of Mevaseret Zion  Israel asserts that these territories are not currently claimed by any other state  and that Israel has the right to control them  Israel s position has not been accepted by most countries and international bodies  and the West Bank  East Jerusalem  and the Gaza Strip are referred to as occupied territories  with Israel as the occupying power  by most international legal and political bodies  51  the rest of the Arab bloc  the UK  52  including the EU  the United States   8    9  dead link    both the General Assembly and Security Council of the United Nations  53  the International Court of Justice  the Conference of High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention  54  and the Israeli Supreme Court  see Israeli West Bank barrier   Some countries and international figures seem to have accorded some credibility to Israel s position  Former U S  President George W  Bush stated  during his presidency  that he did not expect Israel to return entirely to pre 1967 borders  due to  new realities on the ground   55  However  the longstanding policy of the United States called upon Israel to offer territorial compensation  56  Both U S  President Bill Clinton and U K  Prime Minister Tony Blair  who played notable roles in attempts at mediation  noted the need for some territorial and diplomatic compromise on this issue  based on the validity of some of the claims of both sides  57  58  One compromise offered by Clinton would have allowed Israel to keep some settlements in the West Bank  especially those in large blocks near the pre 1967 borders of Israel  In return  Palestinians would have received concessions of land in other parts of the country  59  The United Nations did not declare any change in the status of the territories as of the creation of the Palestinian National Authority between 1993 and 2000  although a 1999 U N  document 51  implied that the chance for a change in that status was slim at that period  During the period between the 1993 Oslo Accords and the Second Intifada beginning in 2000  Israeli officials claimed that the term  occupation  did not accurately reflect the state of affairs in the territories  During this time  the Palestinian population in large parts of the territories had a large degree of autonomy and only limited exposure to the IDF except when seeking to move between different areas  Following the events of the Second Intifada  and in particular  Operation Defensive Shield  most territories  including Palestinian cities  Area A   are back under effective Israeli military control  so the discussion along those lines is largely moot  In the summer of 2005  Israel implemented its unilateral disengagement plan  about 8500 Israeli citizens living in the Gaza Strip were forcibly removed from the territory  some received alternative homes and a sum of money  The Israel Defense Forces vacated Gaza in 2005  but invaded it again in 2006 in response to rocket attacks and the abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas  In January 2010  King Abdullah of Jordan  after a meeting with the Israeli president Shimon Peres at the World Economic Forum in Davos  declared that his country does not want to rule the West Bank and that  the two state solution  to the Israeli Palestinian conflict was the only viable option  If rule over the territory was to be transferred to the kingdom  it would only  replace Israeli military rule with Jordanian military rule    and the Palestinians want their own state   60  In December 2010  Brazil recognized Palestine as a state with its 1967 borders  This move was later followed by Argentina  Peru  Uruguay  Bolivia and Ecuador  This action was later criticized by Israel and the United States  who labelled it  counterproductive   61   edit  Governorates structure Governorates of Palestine Main article  Governorates of the Palestinian National Authority The Constitution of the League of Arab States says the existence and independence of Palestine cannot be questioned de jure even though the outward signs of this independence have remained veiled as a result of force majeure  62  The League supervised the Egyptian trusteeship of the Palestinian government in Gaza after the termination of the British Mandate and secured assurances from Jordan that the 1950 Act of Union was  without prejudice to the final settlement   63  64  By the 1988 declaration  the PNC empowered its central council to form a government in exile when appropriate  and called upon its executive committee to perform the duties of the government in exile until its establishment  65  Under the terms of the Oslo Accords signed between Israel and the PLO  the latter assumed control over the Jericho area of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip on 17 May 1994  On September 28  1995  following the signing of the Israeli Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and Gaza Strip  Israeli military forces withdrew from the West Bank towns of Nablus  Ramallah  Jericho  Jenin  Tulkarem  Qalqilya and Bethlehem  In December 1995  the PLO also assumed responsibility for civil administration in 17 areas in Hebron  66  While the PLO assumed these responsibilities as a result of Oslo  a new temporary interim administrative body was set up as a result of the Accords to carry out these functions on the ground  the Palestinian National Authority  PNA   An analysis outlining the relationship between the PLO  the PNA  or PA   Palestine and Israel in light of the interim arrangements set out in the Oslo Accords begins by stating that   Palestine may best be described as a transitional association between the PA and the PLO   It goes on to explain that this transitional association accords the PA responsibility for local government and the PLO responsibility for representation of the Palestinian people in the international arena  while prohibiting it from concluding international agreements that affect the status of the occupied territories  This situation is said to be accepted by the Palestinian population insofar as it is viewed as a temporary arrangement  67  In March 2008 it was reported that the PA was working to increase the number of countries that recognize Palestine and that a PA representative had signed a bilateral agreement between the State of Palestine and Costa Rica  68  A recent Al Haq position paper said the reality is that the PA has entered into various agreements with international organizations and states  These instances of foreign relations undertaken by the PA signify that the Interim Agreement is part of a larger on going peace process  and that the restrictions on the foreign policy operations of the PA conflict with the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self determination  now a norm with a nature of jus cogens  which includes a right to engage in international relations with other peoples  69   edit  See also Geography portal Asia portal

painful and very difficult step for all of us  especially those  including myself  who were forced to leave their homes and their towns and villages  carrying only some of our belongings and our grief
