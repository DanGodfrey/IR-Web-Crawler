history Main article  Publication history of Dick Grayson Robin  The Boy Wonder The character was first introduced in Detective Comics  38  1940  by Batman creators Bill Finger and Bob Kane  Robin s debut was an effort to make Batman a lighter  more sympathetic character  DC Comics also thought a teenaged superhero would appeal to young readers  being an effective audience surrogate  The name  Robin  The Boy Wonder  and the medieval look of the original costume are inspired by the legendary hero Robin Hood  as well as the red breasted American Robin  which parallels the  winged  motif of Batman  Dick Grayson was born on the first day of spring  son of John and Mary Grayson  a young couple of aerialists  In his first appearance  Dick is a circus acrobat  and with his parents make up the  Flying Graysons   While preparing for a performance  Dick overhears two gangsters attempting to extort protection money from the circus owner  The owner refuses  so the gangsters sabotage the trapeze wires with acid  During the next performance  the trapeze from which Dick s parents are swinging snaps  sending them to their deaths  Before he can go to the police  Batman appears to him and warns him that the two gangsters work for Tony Zucco  a very powerful crime boss  and that revealing his knowledge could lead to his death  When Batman recounts the murder of his own parents  Dick asks to become his aide  After extensive training  Dick becomes Robin  They start by disrupting Zucco s gambling and extortion rackets  They then successfully bait the riled Zucco into visiting a construction site  where they capture him  Robin s origin has a thematic connection to Batman s in that both see their parents killed by criminals  creating an urge to battle the criminal element  Bruce sees a chance to direct the anger and rage that Dick feels in a way that he himself cannot  thus creating a father son bond and understanding between the two  Throughout the 1940s and 1950s  DC

Batman and Damian s Robin will be reversed from the usual Batman Robin relationship  Batman will be lighter  while Robin will be darker  However  Dick s experience as the Dark Knight would harden his

opposed to his mid late twenties  is drawn a bit shorter than in his pre relaunch frame  This is likely due to adding believability to his acrobat past  10  According to various interviews it is stated that Dick was adopted at 16  as opposed to 12  This is due to the DCNU s timeline existing for 5 years  However  since Batman was operating solo an additional five years before being outed  this means Batman met Robin in year five as opposed to year two  11  In the new Nightwing series  Dick is given control of Haley s Circus after Mr  Haley  the owner  dies  12  Love interests Dick Grayson has had several romantic relationships with various female characters throughout his years fighting crime  Starfire  Grayson fell in love with fellow Teen Titans teammate Starfire and nearly married her  but their wedding was interrupted by Raven  whose body was taken over by her evil side at the time   Raven murdered the priest before he could pronounce Dick and Kory husband and wife  The relationship was already on unsteady ground  with Kory fearing that Dick was rushing into marriage and also concerned by the anti alien sentiments that sprang up in response to the news of the impending nuptials  When Grayson rejoined the JLA  it was stated that Dick had moved on  13  In  Titans Tomorrow   a storyline of a potential future  Batwoman  Bette Kane  stated that Starfire would have a wonderful future with Nightwing  14  However  it is later implied during Infinite Crisis that Dick Grayson is deceased in this timeline  15  In the  Kingdom Come  alternate reality  Starfire

members of the Teen Titans  with her serving as his second in command  While the two are best friends and confidantes  17  and express that they love each other  18  their relationship has been portrayed as that of brother and sister  Dick gave Donna away at her wedding to her former husband Terry  and she in turn hosted his own  failed  wedding to Starfire  She even died  albeit not permanently  saving his life  19  Marv Wolfman  creator of the Nightwing persona and longtime Titans writer  indicated that there was once a Dick and Donna romance planned  but the idea was quashed by editorial mandate  Donna personally recruited Dick  now Batman  into an incarnation of the Justice League  20  Though she angrily criticized his decision to follow Bruce in distancing himself from others  21  she trusted him completely as their leader  22  Catalina Flores  After Tarantula killed Blockbuster  23  she had sex with Nightwing on a rooftop  Nightwing s consent was dubious at the time as he was in shock from deep emotional trauma  prompting debate over whether he was raped  24  Writer Devin Grayson herself has given the statement   For the record  I ve never used the word  rape   I just said it was non consensual   This is further confused by the script for Nightwing  93 specifically mentioning  in parentheses  that this scene was a rape  25  Skills  abilities  and resources This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Dick Grayson possesses the peak athletic strength and endurance of a man in his mid twenties who regularly engages in

Tamaran  and American Sign Language  He is also a brilliant and experienced strategist with superlative leadership skills  having served as leader to the Titans  the Outsiders  and even the Justice League  Additionally  Dick s interpersonal skills and efforts to remain in contact with other heroes makes him a master at rallying  unifying  and inspiring the superhero community  a skill in which he has surpassed his mentor  28  Besides his resources as Bruce Wayne s adopted son and heir apparent  Dick s parents also left him a trust fund which Lucius Fox turned into a small fortune  Although it is not comparable to Bruce Wayne s wealth  it has been enough to maintain his Nightwing equipment  purchase the rights to Haly s Circus  saving Dick s former home from financial troubles   and secretly buy his former Bl dhaven apartment building at 1013 Parkthorne Avenue  Costumes The Robin costume worn by Grayson alluded to the American Robin and Robin Hood  The cape was alternately depicted as yellow or green  The costume also featured pointed  pixie boots   which some artists would discard from the portrayal  Grayson s Nightwing costume was made of a version of the Nomex fire resistant  triple weave Kevlar lined material  It was an excellent protection against damage  and was also insulated against electricity  Specifically tailored to his style of fighting  Nightwing s costume had fewer body armor inlays than Batman  anticipating a decreased need for shock absorption and an increased capacity for motion  Against opponents both fast and strong  Nightwing had supplemental body armor overlays he could attach to his gauntlets  boots  shoulders  and mask  Instead of a black cape to keep him hidden  which Grayson dislikes wearing  29  30  the suit was light sensitive  darkening when there was more light in the area  The mask  in the form of his symbol  was fixed in place with spirit gum  and included a built in radio transmitter receiver and Starlite night vision lenses  The third costume  with its stylized blue  wing  across his shoulders and extending to his hands  coloring his two middle fingers  over a black bodysuit  made its first appearance in Nightwing  Ties That Bind  2  October 1995   and was designed by the cover artist Brian Stelfreeze  His suit was also equipped with wings that allow him to glide in the air or fly  With his return to Nightwing  Dick will wear this same suit  albeit with the blue  wing  being red now  Grayson s Batsuit featured a lighter cape to accommodate his more acrobatic fighting style 29  and a utility belt with a bat shaped buckle  31  He also developed  para capes  for his and Damian s costumes which gave them the ability to glide  31  Grayson is noticeably shorter than Bruce Wayne  30  Other

featuring Robin while disregarding incongruities with the single ongoing history that had been followed since inception  The character history of the Earth Two Robin accordingly adopts all of the earliest stories featuring the character from the 1940s and 1950s  while the adventures of the mainstream Robin  who lived on  Earth One   begin later in time and with certain elements of his origin retold  Both were depicted as separate  though parallel  individuals living in their respective universes  Batman Beyond  comics  The 2010 comic book limited series Batman Beyond  set after the events

over Dick s body  Before the next show  Boston tries to convince Dick to perform solo  However  Dick tells him that family means too much to him  Dick poses the question that Boston s seeming

over the role  The plot dealt with the Dynamic Duo facing off against the Wizard  a mysterious hooded villain  Batman  TV series  Actor Burt Ward played Dick Grayson Robin in the Batman television

Woodrow Roosevelt High School   Robin was noted for delivering one liners that would begin with  Holy  and end with  Batman   such as  Holy haberdashery  Batman   or  Holy atomic pile  Batman   Ward also reprised the role for the feature film produced in 1966 in conjunction with the show  as well as for the 1979 NBC television special  Legends of the Superheroes  Birds of Prey  TV series  Dick Grayson was mentioned by Barbara Gordon  in an episode of the short lived television series Birds of Prey  The Graysons On October 1  2008  it was announced that the CW network was preparing a new

Jason Hillhouse provides the voice of Dick Grayson  while Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reprise their respective roles  from the DC animated universe  as Batman and the Joker in the storyboard sequence  Director Tim Burton planned to cast actor Ricky Addison Reed as Robin  but later felt it was unimportant to the story and cut Robin out altogether  Marlon Wayans was originally cast as Robin in the 1992 film Batman Returns  41  however it was felt that the film featured too many characters  so the character was omitted from that film  In an earlier script of Batman Returns  he was portrayed as a technologically savvy street kid who would help Batman following his narrow escape when the Penguin tried to kill him  He would later play a crucial role in Batman s final confrontation with the Penguin  In that script  he was simply called Robin  and has no known real name  He was considered for the role in Batman Forever  but the change in directors from Tim Burton to Joel Schumacher would also mean a change in the choice of actor for the role of Robin  Despite not actually appearing in either film  he was reportedly still paid for the role  Batman Forever Dick Grayson Robin was played by actor Chris O Donnell in 1995 s Batman Forever  His costume in the film uses the familiar red and green coloring of the traditional Robin costume  after first contemplating using the code name

to avenge his family  Batman  amp  Robin In the sequel Batman  amp  Robin  released in 1997  O Donnell reprised the role of Robin  He wears a new costume  similar to that of Nightwing except that it is molded rubber  has a cape  a utility belt  and a mask  the emblazoned logo is a deep red instead of blue  Also  for the finale where he  Batman  and Batgirl unveil new costumes  the logo is changed to an ice blue color  In the film  Robin has grown frustrated with playing second fiddle to Batman and feels held back as his overconfidence causes Batman not to trust him  Nolan series Series director Christopher Nolan stated that as long as he is directing  Robin will not appear in the films  He reasons that the films take place in the early days of  a young Batman   whereas Dick Grayson is  still a little kid at this point   42  Teen Titans In 2007  Robin was confirmed as the lead in a Teen Titans movie for Warner Bros   with Akiva Goldsman as the writer  43  Animation Dick Grayson
