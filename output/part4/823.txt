of fiction consisting of stories that are set in worlds in which history has diverged from the actual history of the world  It can be variously seen as a sub genre of literary fiction  science fiction  and historical fiction  different alternate history works may use tropes from any or all of these genres  It is sometimes abbreviated AH  2  Another occasionally used term for the genre is  allohistory   literally  other history    3  Since the 1950s  this type of fiction has to a large extent merged with science fictional tropes involving cross time travel between alternate histories or psychic awareness of the existence of  our  universe by the people in another  or ordinary voyaging uptime  into the past  or downtime  into the future  that results in history splitting into two or more time lines  Cross time  time splitting and alternate history themes have become so closely interwoven that it is impossible to discuss them fully apart from one another   Alternate History  looks at  what if  scenarios from some of history s most pivotal turning points and presents a completely different version  sometimes based on science and fact  but often based on conjecture  The exploration of how the world would look today if various changes occurred and what these alternate worlds would be like forms the basis of this vast subject matter  In French  Italian  Spanish and German  alternate history novels are called uchronie  This neologism is based on the prefix u   as in the word utopia  a place that does not exist  and the Greek for time  chronos  An uchronie  then  is defined as a time that does not exist  a  non time   This term apparently also inspired the name of the alternate history book list  uchronia net  4  Contents 1 Definition 2 History of alternate

sites  edit  Definition In writing an alternate history  the author makes the conscious choice to change something in our past  According to Steven H Silver  alternate history requires three things  1  the story must have a point of divergence from the history of our world prior to the time at which the author is writing  2  a change that would alter history as it is known  and 3  an examination of the ramifications of that change Example  Nazis produced atomic bomb instead of USA   5  Several genres of fiction have been confused as alternate histories  Science fiction set in what was the future but is now the past  like Arthur C  Clarke s 2001  A Space Odyssey or Nineteen Eighty Four   are not alternate history because the author has not made the conscious choice to change the past  5 Secret history  works that document things that are not known to have happened historically but would not have changed history had they happened  is also not to be confused with alternate history  5  6  Alternate history is related to but distinct from counterfactual history the term used by some professional historians when using thoroughly researched and carefully reasoned speculations on  what might have happened if     as a tool of academic historical research  7   edit  History of alternate history literature  edit  Antiquity and Medieval The earliest example of an alternate history is Book IX  sections 17 19  of Livy s Ab Urbe condita  Livy contemplated an alternative 4th century BC in which Alexander the Great expanded his empire westward instead of eastward  Livy asked   What would have been the results for Rome if she had been engaged in war with Alexander   8  9  10  Joanot Martorell s 1490 epic romance Tirant lo Blanc  written when the loss of Constantinople to the Turks was still a recent and traumatic memory to Christian Europe  tells the story of the valiant knight Tirant The White from Brittany who gets to the embattled remnant of the Byzantine Empire  becomes a Megaduke and commander of its armies  and manages to fight off the invading Ottoman armies of Mehmet II  save the city from Islamic conquest  and even chase the Turks deeper into lands they had conquered before   edit  19th century One of the earliest works of alternate history published in large quantities for the reception of a popular audience may be the French Louis Geoffroy s Histoire de la Monarchie universelle  Napol on et la conqu te du monde  1812 1832   History of the Universal Monarchy  Napoleon And The Conquest Of The World   1836   which imagines Napoleon s First French Empire victorious in the French invasion of Russia in 1811 and in an invasion of England in 1814  later unifying the world under Bonaparte s rule  9  In the English language  the first known complete alternate history is Nathaniel Hawthorne s short story  P  s Correspondence   published in 1845  It recounts the tale of a man who is considered  a madman  due to his perceiving a different 1845  a reality in which long dead famous people are still alive such as the poets Burns  Byron  Shelley  and Keats  the actor Edmund Kean  the British politician George Canning and even Napoleon Bonaparte  The first novel length alternate history in English would seem to be Castello Holford s Aristopia  1895   While not as nationalistic as Louis Geoffroy s Napol on et la conqu te du monde  1812 1823  Aristopia is another attempt to portray a utopian society  In Aristopia  the earliest settlers in Virginia discover a reef made of solid gold and are able to build a Utopian society in North America   edit  Early 20th century and the era of the pulps A number of alternate history stories and novels appeared in the late 19th and early 20th centuries  see  for example  Charles Petrie s If  A Jacobite Fantasy  1926    11  In 1931  British historian Sir John Squire collected a series of essays from some of the leading historians of the period in the anthology If It Had Happened Otherwise  In this work  scholars from major universities as well as important non university based authors turned their attention to such questions as  If the Moors in Spain Had Won  and  If Louis XVI Had Had an Atom of Firmness   The essays range from serious scholarly efforts to Hendrik Willem van Loon s fanciful and satiric portrayal of an independent 20th century Dutch city state on the island of Manhattan  Among the authors included were Hilaire Belloc  Andr  Maurois  and Winston Churchill  One of the entries in Squire s volume was Churchill s  If Lee Had Not Won the Battle of Gettysburg   written from the viewpoint of a historian in a world where the Confederacy had won the American Civil War  considering what would have happened if the north had been victorious  in other words  a character from an alternate world imagining a world more like the real one we live in  although not identical in every detail   This kind of speculative work  which posts from the point of view of an alternate history is variously known as a  recursive alternate history   a  double blind what if  or an  alternate alternate history   12  American humorist author James Thurber parodied alternate history stories about the American Civil War in his 1930 story   If Grant had been drinking at Appomattox   which he accompanied with this very brief introduction   Scribner s magazine is publishing a series of three articles   If Booth Had Missed Lincoln    If Lee Had Won the Battle of Gettysburg   and  If Napoleon Had Escaped to America   This is the fourth  Another example of alternate history from this period  and arguably the first to explicitly posit cross time travel from one universe to another as anything more than a visionary experience  is H G  Wells  Men Like Gods  1923  in which several Englishmen are transferred via an accidental encounter with a cross time machine into an alternate universe featuring a seemingly pacifistic and utopian Britain  When the Englishmen  led by a satiric figure based on Winston Churchill  try to seize power  the utopians simply point a ray gun at them and send them on to someone else s universe  Wells describes a multiverse of alternative worlds  complete with the paratime travel machines that would later become popular with U S  pulp writers  but since his hero experiences only a single alternate world this story is not very different from conventional alternate history  13  The 1930s would see alternate history move into a new arena  The December 1933 issue of Astounding published Nat Schachner s  Ancestral Voices   quickly followed by Murray Leinster s  Sidewise in Time   While earlier alternate histories examined reasonably straightforward divergences  Leinster attempted something completely different  In his  world gone mad   pieces of Earth traded places with their analogs from different timelines  The story follows Professor Minott and his students from a fictitious Robinson College as they wander through analogues of worlds that followed a different history  The world in 1964 in the novel Fatherland where the Germans won World War Two  A somewhat similar approach was taken by Robert A  Heinlein in his 1941 novelette Elsewhen  A professor trains his mind to move his body across timelines  He then hypnotizes his students so they can explore more of them  Eventually each settles in the reality most suitable for him or her  Some of the worlds they visit are mundane  some very odd  and others follow science fiction or fantasy conventions  World War II produced alternate history for propaganda  both British 14  and American 15  authors wrote works depicting Nazi invasions of their respective countries as cautionary tales   edit  Time travel as a means of creating historical divergences The period around the second World War also saw the publication of the time travel novel Lest Darkness Fall by L  Sprague de Camp where an American academic travels to the Italy of the Ostrogoths at the time of the Byzantine invasion led by Belisarius  De Camp s work is concerned with the historical changes wrought by his time traveler  Martin Padway  thereby making the work an alternate history  Padway is depicted as making permanent changes and implicitly forming a new time branch  Time travel as the cause of a point of divergence  creating two histories where before there was one  or simply replacing the future that existed before the time traveling event  has continued to be a popular theme  in Bring the Jubilee  by Ward Moore  the protagonist  who lives in an alternate history in which the Confederate States of America won the Civil War  travels through time and brings about a Union victory in the Battle of Gettysburg  When a story s assumptions about the nature of time travel lead to the complete replacement of the visited time s future rather than just the creation of an additional time line  the device of a  time patrol  is often used  Such an agency has the grim task of saving civilization every day  every hour  with patrol members depicted most notably in Poul Anderson s  Time Patrol  racing uptime and downtime to preserve the  correct  history  This is eventually revealed to be the one in which humanity transforms itself into a benevolent super species that  amongst other achievements  creates time travel to ensure its own existence  This can lead to terrible moral dilemmas  In Delenda Est  the interference of time travelling outlaws causes Carthage to win the Second Punic War and destroy Rome  As a result  there is a completely different 20th century  not better or worse  just completely different   The hero  Patrol Agent Manse Everard  must return to that period  fight the outlaws and change history back  restoring his  and our  familiar history but only at the price of totally destroying the world that has taken its place  and which is equally deserving of existence  The stakes are the highest imaginable  billions of lives balanced against other billions of lives  for one man to decide   Risking your neck in order to negate a world full of people like yourself  is how the hero describes what he eventually undertakes  A more recent example is Making History by Stephen Fry  in which a time machine is used to alter history so that Adolf Hitler was never born  A different leader rose to prominence in Nazi Germany  taking advantage of the economic downturn  This leader turns out to be more intelligent  charismatic and ruthless than Hitler  The outcome of this new leader results in Nazi success in World War II  the extermination of the entire Jewish population  a cold war between Germany and the US  and the prevention of post war attitude changes that led to the decriminalization of homosexuality and the discrediting of racial segregation   edit  Cross time stories   Whether to make the  reason  mandatory for the   cleanup   template is being discussed  See the request for comment to help reach a

story  The Wheels of If   Unknown Fantasy Fiction  October 1940   in which the hero is repeatedly shifted from one alternate history to another  each more remote from our own than the last  This subgenre was used early on for purposes far removed from quasi academic examination of alternative outcomes to historical events  Fredric Brown employed it to satirize the science fiction pulps and their adolescent readers and fears of foreign invasion in the classic What Mad Universe  1949   In Clifford D  Simak s Ring Around the Sun  1953   the hero ends up in an alternate earth of thick forests in which humanity never developed but where a band of mutants is establishing a colony  the story line appears to frame the author s anxieties regarding McCarthyism and the Cold War  citation needed  Also in the late 1940s and the 1950s  however  writers such as H  Beam Piper  Sam Merwin  Jr  and Andre Norton wrote thrillers set in a multiverse in which all alternate histories are co existent and travel between them occurs via a technology involving portals and or paratime capsules  These authors established the convention of a secret paratime trading empire that exploits and or protects worlds lacking the paratime technology via a network of James Bond style secret agents  Piper called them the  paratime police    This concept provided a convenient framing for packing a smorgasbord of historical alternatives  and even of timeline  branches   into a single novel  either via the hero chasing or being chased by the villain s  through multiple worlds or  less artfully  via discussions between the paratime cops and their superiors  or between paratime agents and new recruits  regarding the histories of such worlds  The paratime theme is sometimes used without the police  Poul Anderson dreamed up the Old Phoenix tavern as a nexus between alternate histories  A character from a modern American alternate history Operation Chaos can thus appear in the English Civil War setting of A Midsummer s Tempest  In this context  the distinction between an alternate history and a parallel universe with some points in common but no common history may not be feasible  as the writer may not provide enough information to distinguish  Paratime thrillers published in recent decades often cite the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics  first formulated by Hugh Everett III in 1957  to account for the differing worlds  Some science fiction writers interpret the splitting of worlds to depend on human decision making and free will  while others rely on the butterfly effect from chaos theory to amplify random differences at the atomic or subatomic level into a macroscopic divergence at some specific point in history  either way  science fiction writers usually have all changes flow from a particular historical point of divergence  often abbreviated  POD  by fans of the genre   Prior to Everett  science fiction writers drew on higher dimensions and the speculations of P  D  Ouspensky to explain their characters  cross time journeys  While many justifications for alternate histories involve a multiverse  the  many world  theory would naturally involve many worlds  in fact a continually exploding array of universes  In quantum theory  new worlds would proliferate with every quantum event  and even if the writer uses human decisions  every decision that could be made differently would result in a different timeline  A writer s fictional multiverse may  in fact  preclude some decisions as humanly impossible  as when  in Night Watch  Terry Pratchett depicts a character informing Vimes that while anything that can happen  has happened  nevertheless there is no history whatsoever in which Vimes has ever murdered his wife  When the writer explicitly maintains that all possible decisions are made in all possible ways  one possible conclusion is that the characters were neither brave  nor clever  nor skilled  but simply lucky enough to happen on the universe in which they did not choose the cowardly route  take the stupid action  fumble the crucial activity  etc   few writers focus on this idea  although it has been explored in stories such as Larry Niven s All the Myriad Ways  where the reality of all possible universes leads to an epidemic of suicide and crime because people conclude their choices have no moral import  In any case  even if it is true that every possible outcome occurs in some world  it can still be argued that traits such as bravery and intelligence might still affect the relative frequency of worlds in which better or worse outcomes occurred  even if the total number of worlds with each type of outcome is infinite  it is still possible to assign a different measure to different infinite sets   The physicist David Deutsch  a strong advocate of the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics  has argued along these lines  saying that  By making good choices  doing the right thing  we thicken the stack of universes in which versions of us live reasonable lives  When you succeed  all the copies of you who made the same decision succeed too  What you do for the better increases the portion of the multiverse where good things happen   16  This view is perhaps somewhat too abstract to be explored directly in science fiction stories  but a few writers have tried  such as Greg Egan in his short story The Infinite Assassin  where an agent is trying to contain reality scrambling  whirlpools  that form around users of a certain drug  and the agent is constantly trying to maximize the consistency of behavior among his alternate selves  attempting to compensate for events and thoughts he experiences but he guesses are of low measure relative to those experienced by most of his other selves  Many writers perhaps the majority avoid the discussion entirely  In one novel of this type  H  Beam Piper s Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen  a Pennsylvania State Police officer  who knows how to make gunpowder  is transported from our world to an alternate universe where the recipe for gunpowder is a tightly held secret and saves a country that is about to be conquered by its neighbors  The paratime patrol members are warned against going into the timelines immediately surrounding it  where the country will be overrun  but the book never depicts the slaughter of the innocent thus entailed  remaining solely in the timeline where the country is saved  The cross time theme was further developed in the 1960s by Keith Laumer in the first three volumes of his Imperium sequence  which would be completed in Zone Yellow  1990   Piper s politically more sophisticated variant was adopted and adapted by Michael Kurland and Jack Chalker in the 1980s  Chalker s G O D  Inc trilogy  1987 89   featuring paratime detectives Sam and Brandy Horowitz  marks the first attempt at merging the paratime thriller with the police procedural citation needed   Kurland s Perchance  1988   the first volume of the never completed  Chronicles of Elsewhen   presents a multiverse of secretive cross time societies that utilize a variety of means for cross time travel  ranging from high tech capsules to mutant powers  Harry Turtledove has launched the Crosstime Traffic series for teenagers featuring a variant of H  Beam Piper s paratime trading empire  The concept of a cross time version of a world war  involving rival paratime empires  was developed in Fritz Leiber s Change War series  starting with the Hugo Award winning The Big Time  1958   followed by Richard C  Meredith s Timeliner trilogy in the 1970s  Michael McCollum s A Greater Infinity  1982  and John Barnes  Timeline Wars trilogy in the 1990s  Such  paratime  stories may include speculation that the laws of nature can vary from one universe to the next  providing a science fictional explanation or veneer for what is normally fantasy  Aaron Allston s Doc Sidhe and Sidhe Devil take place between our world  the  grim world  and an alternate  fair world  where the Sidhe retreated to  Although technology is clearly present in both worlds  and the  fair world  parallels our history  about fifty years out of step  there is functional magic in the fair world  Even with such explanation  the more explicitly the alternate world resembles a normal fantasy world  the more likely the story is to be labeled fantasy  as in Poul Anderson s  House Rule  and  Loser s Night   In both science fiction and fantasy  whether a given parallel universe is an alternate history may not be clear  The writer might allude to a POD only to explain the existence and make no use of the concept  or may present the universe without explanation to its existence   edit  Major writers explore alternate histories In 1962  Philip K  Dick published The Man in the High Castle  an alternate history in which Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan won World War II  This book contained an example of  alternate alternate  history  in that one of its characters is the author of a book in which the Allies won the war  It was followed by Vladimir Nabokov s Ada or Ardor  A Family Chronicle  1969   a story of incest that takes place within an alternate North America settled in part by Czarist Russia  and that borrows from Dick s idea of  alternate alternate  history  the world of Nabokov s hero is wracked by rumors of a  counter earth  that apparently is ours   Some critics believe that the references to a counter earth suggest that the world portrayed in Ada is a delusion in the mind of the hero  another favorite theme of Dick s novels   Strikingly  the characters in Ada seem to acknowledge their own world as the copy or negative version  calling it  Anti Terra  while its mythical twin is the real  Terra   Not only history but science has followed a divergent path on Anti Terra  it boasts all the same technology as our world  but all based on water instead of electricity  When a character in Ada makes a long distance call  all the toilets in the house flush at once to provide hydraulic power  Isaac Asimov s short story What If   is about a couple who can explore alternate realities by means of a television like device  This idea can also be found in Asimov s 1955 novel The End of Eternity  In that novel  the  Eternals  can change the realities of the world  without people being aware of it  Guido Morselli described the defeat of Italy  and subsequently France  in World War I in his 1975 novel Past Conditional  Contro passato prossimo  where the static Alpine front line which divided Italy from Austria during that war collapses when the Germans and the Austrians forsake trench warfare and adopt blitzkrieg twenty years in advance  Kingsley Amis set his 1976 novel The Alteration in the 20th century  but major events in the Reformation did not take place  and Protestantism is limited to the breakaway Republic of New England  Martin Luther was reconciled to the Roman Catholic Church and later became Pope Germanian I  The Plot Against America  2004  by Philip Roth looks at an America where Franklin D  Roosevelt is defeated in 1940 in his bid for a third term as President of the United States  and Charles Lindbergh is elected  leading to increasing fascism and anti Semitism in the U S  Michael Chabon  occasionally an author of speculative fiction  contributed to the genre with his 2007 novel The Yiddish Policemen s Union  This book explores a world in which the State of Israel was destroyed in its infancy and many of the world s Jews instead live in a small strip of Alaska set aside by the US government for Jewish settlement  The story follows a Jewish detective solving a murder case in the Yiddish speaking city of Sitka  Stylistically  Chabon borrows heavily from the noir and detective fiction genres  while exploring social issues related to Jewish history and culture   edit  Contemporary alternate history in popular literature The late 1980s and the 1990s saw a boom in popular fiction versions of alternate history  fueled by the emergence of the prolific alternate history author Harry Turtledove  as well as the development of the steampunk genre and two series of anthologies the What Might Have Been series edited by Gregory Benford and the Alternate     series edited by Mike Resnick  This period also saw alternate history works by S M  Stirling  Kim Stanley Robinson  Harry Harrison  Howard Waldrop and others  Since the late 1990s  Harry Turtledove has been the most prolific practitioner of alternate history and has been given the title  Master of Alternate History  by some  17  His books include those of Timeline 191  a k a  Southern Victory   in which Confederate States of America won the American Civil War  and the Worldwar series  in which aliens invaded Earth during World War II  Other stories by Turtledove include A Different Flesh  in which America was not colonized from Asia during the last ice age  In the Presence of Mine Enemies  in which the Nazis won World War II  and Ruled Britannia  in which the Spanish Armada succeeded in conquering Britain in the Elizabethan era  with William Shakespeare being given the task of writing the play that will motivate the Britons to rise up against their Spanish conquerors  He also co authored a book with actor Richard Dreyfuss The Two Georges  in which the United Kingdom retained the American colonies  with George Washington and King George III making peace  He did a two volume series in which the Japanese not only bombed Pearl Harbor but also invaded and occupied the Hawaiian Islands  Perhaps the most incessantly explored theme in popular alternate history focuses on worlds in which the Nazis won World War Two  In some versions  the Nazis and or Axis Powers conquer the entire world  in others  they conquer most of the world but a  Fortress America  exists under siege  while in others  there is a Nazi Japanese Cold War comparable to the US Soviet equivalent in  our  timeline  Fatherland  1992  by Robert Harris  is set in Europe following the Nazi victory  Several writers have posited points of departure for such a world but then have injected time splitters from the future or paratime travel for instance James P  Hogan s The Proteus Operation  Norman Spinrad wrote The Iron Dream in 1972  which is intended to be a science fiction novel written by Adolf Hitler after fleeing from Europe to North America in the 1920s  In Jo Walton s  Small Change  series  the United Kingdom made peace with Hitler before the involvement of the United States in World War II  and fascism slowly strangled the UK  Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and William R  Forstchen have written a novel  1945  in which the U S  defeated Japan but not Germany in World War II  resulting in a Cold War with Germany rather than the Soviet Union  Gingrich and Forstchen neglected to write the promised sequel  instead  they wrote a trilogy about the American Civil War  starting with Gettysburg  A Novel of the Civil War  in which the Confederates win a victory at the Battle of Gettysburg  Also from that general era  Martin Cruz Smith  in his first novel  posited an independent American Indian nation following the defeat of Custer in The Indians Won  1970   18  Beginning with The Probability Broach in 1981  L  Neil Smith wrote several novels that postulated the disintegration of the U S  Federal Government during the Whiskey Rebellion and the creation of a libertarian utopia  A recent time traveling splitter variant involves entire communities being shifted elsewhere to become the unwitting creators of new time branches  These communities are transported from the present  or the near future  to the past or to another time line via a natural disaster  the action of technologically advanced aliens  or a human experiment gone wrong  S  M  Stirling wrote the Island in the Sea of Time trilogy  in which Nantucket Island and all its modern inhabitants are transported to Bronze Age times to become the world s first superpower  In Eric Flint s 1632 series  a small town in West Virginia is transported to 17th century central Europe and drastically changes the course of the Thirty Years  War  which was then underway  John Birmingham s Axis of Time trilogy deals with the culture shock when a United Nations naval task force from 2021 finds itself back in 1942 helping the Allies against the Empire of Japan and the Germans  and doing almost as much harm as good in spite of its advanced weapons   Similarly  Robert Charles Wilson s Mysterium depicts a failed U S  government experiment which transports a small American town into an alternative version of the U S  run by believers in a form of Christianity known as Gnosticism  who are engaged in a bitter war with the  Spanish  in Mexico   The chief scientist at the laboratory where the experiment occurred is described as a Gnostic  and references to Christian Gnosticism appear repeatedly in the book    edit  Alternate history in the contemporary fantasy genre Many fantasies and science fantasies are set in a world that has a history somewhat similar to our own world  but with magic added  Some posit points of divergence  but some also feature magic altering history all along  One example of a universe that is in part historically recognizable but also obeys different physical laws is Poul Anderson s Three Hearts and Three Lions in which the Matter of France is history  and the fairy folk are real and powerful  A partly familiar European history for which the author provides a point of divergence is Randall Garrett s  Lord Darcy  series  a monk systemizing magic rather than science  so the use of foxglove to treat heart disease is called superstition  The other great point of divergence in this timeline occurs in 1199  when Richard the Lionheart survives the Siege of Chaluz and returns to England  making the Angevin Empire so strong it survives into the 20th century  Jonathan Strange  amp  Mr Norrell takes place in an alternative version of England where a separate Kingdom ruled by the Raven King and founded on magic existed in Northumbria for over 300 years  In Patricia Wrede s Regency fantasies  Great Britain has a Royal Society of Wizards  and in Poul Anderson s A Midsummer Tempest William Shakespeare is remembered as the Great Historian  with the novel itself taking place in the era of Oliver Cromwell and Charles I  with an alternate outcome for the English Civil War and an earlier Industrial Revolution  The Tales of Alvin Maker series by Orson Scott Card  a parallel to the life of Joseph Smith  Jr   founder of the Latter Day Saint movement  takes place in an alternate America  beginning in the early 19th century  Prior to that time  a POD occurred  England  under the control of Oliver Cromwell  had banished  makers   or anyone else demonstrating  knacks   an ability to perform seemingly supernatural feats  to the North American continent  Thus the early American colonists embraced as perfectly ordinary these gifts  and counted on them as a part of their daily lives  The political divisions of the continent is considerably altered  with two large English colonies bookending a smaller  American  nation  one aligned with England  and the other governed by exiled Cavaliers  Actual historical figures are seen in a much different light  Ben Franklin is revered as the continent s finest  maker   George Washington was executed at the hands of an English army  and  Tom  Jefferson is the first president of  Apallachee   the result of a compromise between the Continentals and the British  On the other hand  when the  Old Ones  still manifest themselves in England in Keith Roberts s Pavane  which takes place in a technologically backward world after a Spanish assassination of Elizabeth I allowed the Spanish Armada to conquer England  the possibility that the fairies were real but retreated from modern advances makes the POD possible  the fairies really were present all along  in a secret history  Again  in the English Renaissance fantasy Armor of Light by Melissa Scott and Lisa A  Barnett  the magic used in the book  by Dr  John Dee and others  actually was practiced in the Renaissance  positing a secret history of effective magic makes this an alternate history with a POD  Sir Philip Sidney s surviving the Battle of Zutphen  and shortly thereafter saving the life of Christopher Marlowe  Many works of fantasy posit a world in which known practitioners of magic were able to make it function  and where the consequences of such reality would not  in fact  disturb history to such an extent as to make it plainly alternate history  Many ambiguous alternate secret histories are set in Renaissance or pre Renaissance times  and may explicitly include a  retreat  from the world  which would explain the current absence of such phenomena  When the magical version of our world s history is set in contemporary times  the distinction becomes clear between alternate history on the one hand and contemporary fantasy  using in effect a form of secret history  as when Josepha Sherman s Son of Darkness has an elf living in New York City  in disguise  on the other  In works such as Robert A  Heinlein s Magic  Incorporated where a construction company can use magic to rig up stands at a sporting event and Poul Anderson s Operation Chaos and its sequel Operation Luna  where djinns are serious weapons of war with atomic bombs the use of magic throughout the United States and other modern countries makes it clear that this is not secret history although references in Operation Chaos to degaussing the effects of cold iron make it possible that it is the result of a POD  The sequel clarifies this as the result of a collaboration of Einstein and Planck in 1901  resulting in the theory of  rheatics   Henry Moseley applies this theory to  degauss the effects of cold iron and release the goetic forces   This results in the suppression of ferromagnetism and the reemergence of magic and magical creatures  Alternate history shades off into other fantasy subgenres when the use of actual  though altered  history and geography decreases  although a culture may still be clearly the original source  Barry Hughart s Bridge of Birds and its sequels take place in a fantasy world  albeit one clearly based on China  and with allusions to actual Chinese history  such as the Empress Wu  Richard Garfinkle s Celestial Matters incorporates ancient Chinese physics and Greek Aristotelian physics  using them as if factual  A fantasy version of the paratime police was developed by children s writer Diana Wynne Jones in her Chrestomanci quartet  1977 1988   with wizards taking the place of high tech secret agents  Among the novels in this series  Witch Week stands out for its vivid depiction of a history alternate to that of Chrestomanci s own world rather than our own  and yet with a specific POD that turned it away from the  normal  history of most worlds visited by the wizard   Terry Pratchett s works include several references to alternate histories of

exploration in role playing games  Many games use an alternate historical background for their campaigns  In particular  the fourth edition of GURPS uses a setting containing multiple different alternate histories as its default campaign setting  with the supplement GURPS Infinite Worlds detailing a large number of alternate worlds included in the setting  many of them carryovers from the third edition GURPS supplements GURPS Alternate Earths and GURPS Alternate Earths II   edit  Video games This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  For the same reasons that this genre is explored by role playing games  alternate history is also an intriguing backdrop for the storylines of many video games  A famous example of an alternate history game is Command  amp  Conquer  Red Alert  Released in 1996  the game presents a point of divergence in 1946 where Albert Einstein goes back in time to prevent World War II from ever taking place by erasing Adolf Hitler from time after he is released from Landsberg Prison in 1924  He is successful in his mission  but in the process allows Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union to become powerful enough as a direct result of not having a strong rival dictator like Hitler to keep his power in check to launch a massive campaign to conquer Europe  sparking an alternate  and ultimately costlier  version of the Second World War and  eventually  World War III not once but twice  one where the USSR invades the continental US in the 1970s  and a second where a small group of Soviet leaders  attempting to preempt their defeat  go back in time and eliminate Einstein but end up in a conflict with both the West and a third Japanese side  In the Civilization Series  the player guides a civilization from prehistory to the present day  creating radically altered versions of history on a long time scale  Several scenarios recreate a particular period which becomes the  point of divergence  in an alternate history shaped by the player s actions  Popular examples in Sid Meier s Civilization IV include Desert War  set in the Mediterranean theater of World War II and featuring scripted events tied to possible outcomes of battles  Broken Star  set in a hypothetical Russian civil war in 2010  and Rhye s and Fall of Civilization  an  Earth simulator  designed to mirror a history as closely as possible but incorporating unpredictable elements to provide realistic alternate settings  Crimson Skies is one example of an alternate history spawning multiple interpretations in multiple genres  The stories and games in Crimson Skies take place in an alternate 1930s United States  where the nation crumbled into many hostile states following the effects of the Great Depression  the Great War  and Prohibition  With the road and railway system destroyed  commerce took to the skies  Great cargo zeppelins escorted by fighter squadrons are the targets of many ruthless air pirates and enemy countries  This world has featured in a board game  a PC game  an Xbox game  a collectible miniature game and various promotional novels  comics and short stories  The game Freedom Fighters portrays a situation similar to that of the movie Red Dawn and Red Alert 2  though less comically than the latter  The point of divergence is during World War II  where the Soviet Union develops an atomic bomb first and uses it on Berlin  With the balance of power and influence tipped in Russia s favor  history diverges  brief summaries at the beginning of the game inform the player of the Communist bloc s complete takeover of Europe by 1953  a different ending to the Cuban Missile Crisis  and the spread of Soviet influence into South America and Mexico  The plot of the game revolves around a Soviet invasion of the United States and the resistance fighting in New York City  Similarly  the 2007 video game World in Conflict is set in 1989  with the Soviet Union on the verge of collapse  The point of divergence is several months before the opening of the game  when Warsaw Pact forces staged a desperate invasion of Western Europe  As the game begins  a Soviet invasion force lands in Seattle  taking advantage of the fact that most of the US military is in Europe  The game is divided into three parts  the first focuses on the fighting retreat from Seattle towards Fort Teller in the Cascade Mountains  the second is a flashback to the recent fighting in Europe  which culminated in a Soviet attack on Manhattan  the third chronicles the fight to retake Seattle before a Chinese fleet arrives  which could force the US President to destroy the invaders with a nuclear strike  Turning Point  Fall of Liberty  released in February 2008  is an alternate history first person shooter where Winston Churchill died in 1931 from being hit by a taxi cab  Because of this  Great Britain lacks the charismatic leader needed to keep the country together and Nazi Germany successfully conquers Great Britain via Operation Sealion  Germany later conquers the rest of Europe and North Africa while mass producing their wunderwaffe  The Axis launch a surprise invasion of an isolationist United States in 1953  which forces the country to surrender and submit to a puppet government  The game s main character is a member of a resistance force against the Germans  Another alternate history game involving Nazis is War Front  Turning Point in which Adolf Hitler died during the early days of World War II and thus  a much more effective leadership rose to power  Under the command of a new F hrer  who is referred to as  Chancellor   and his real name is never revealed   Operation Sealion succeeds and the Nazis successfully conquer Britain  sparking a cold war between the Allied Powers and Germany  Another example of alternate history is the Resistance series of first person shooter games  The point of divergence is in the years following World War I  where an isolationist Russian Empire   and later  Western Europe   is conquered by an alien race called the Chimera  The aliens later invade the United States  The Fallout Series of computer role playing games is set in a divergent America  where history after World War II diverges from the real world to follow a retro futuristic timeline  For example  fusion power was invented quite soon after the end of the war  but the transistor was either delayed or never was developed  The result was a future that has a 1950s  World of Tomorrow  feel to it  with extremely high technology such as artificial intelligence implemented with thermionic valves and other technologies now considered obsolete  Iron Storm is a first person shooter set in 1964  where the Great War still continues and international corporations sell stocks as if  betting  on an outcome  Since profits are so great  they continually press for stalemate to keep the conflict in an ongoing cycle of minor advances and losses   edit  Comic books This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Alternate history has also appeared in comic books  An early example is Captain Confederacy  which is set in a world where the Confederate States of America won its independence and has created a Captain America type superhero for propaganda purposes  Influential comic writers have also used an alternate history as the background to their story  Alan Moore s 1986

stories based on their own characters  What If     and Elseworlds  respectively   Most set the stories in different times or base them on different genres with some based on a divergence in their

Conqueror has created alternate realities and different versions of himself due to his time travelling  However after stumbling into Limbo he succeeds in eliminating all the other versions of himself

also features elements of steampunk  In 1978   The Sentinels   one of the first serials in UK girls  comic Misty  featured an alternate world where Nazi Germany conquered Britain in 1940  The alternate world was connected with the mainstream world via two apartment blocks called  The Sentinels   People kept stumbling in from both sides  causing terror over unexplained disappearances and worse  mix ups over parallel world doubles  This culminated in the Gestapo mistakenly arresting a man from the mainstream world and people from both worlds uniting for the rescue mission   edit
