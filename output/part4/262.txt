association which operates a major professional ice hockey league of 30 franchised member clubs  1  of which 7 are currently located in Canada and 23 in the United States  Headquartered in New York City  the NHL is widely considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world  2  and one of the major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada  The Stanley Cup  the oldest professional sports trophy in North America  3  is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season  The league was organized on November 26  1917  in Montreal  Canada  during World War I after the suspension of operations of its predecessor organization  the National Hockey Association  NHA   which had been founded in 1909  4  It started with four teams and  through a series of expansions  contractions  and relocations  the league is now composed of 30 active franchises  After a labour dispute that led to the cancellation of the entire 2004 05 season  the league resumed play under a new collective bargaining agreement that included a salary cap  In 2009  the NHL enjoyed record highs in terms of sponsorships  crowds and television audiences  5  The NHL draws many highly skilled players from all over the world and currently has players from about 20 different countries  6  Although Canadians have historically constituted the majority of the players in the NHL  over the past four plus decades the percentages of American and European trained players have increased both because of the NHL s continued expansion from six to thirty clubs since 1967  and the increased availability of highly skilled European players  especially from former Eastern Bloc countries  7  Contents 1 History 1 1 Early years 1 2 Expansion 1 3 Labour issues 2 Organizational

Livingstone out  Perish the thought  That would have been illegal and unfair  Also  it wouldn t have been sporting  We just resigned  and wished him a fine future with his National Association franchise        Montreal Wanderers owner Sam Lichtenhein  as told to sports journalist Elmer Ferguson 8  A series of disputes in the National Hockey Association  NHA  with Toronto Blueshirts owner Eddie Livingstone led the other owners  representing the Montreal Canadiens  Montreal Wanderers  Ottawa Senators  and Quebec Bulldogs to meet at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal to talk about the NHA s future  9  Realizing the league constitution left them unable to force Livingstone out  the four teams voted instead to suspend the NHA  and on November 26  1917  formed the National Hockey League  10  While a full member of the new league  the Bulldogs were unable to play  and the remaining owners created a new team in Toronto to compete with the Canadiens  Wanderers and Senators  11  The first games were played three weeks later on December 19  Joe Malone scored five goals in a 7 4 victory for the Canadiens over the Senators on opening night  he finished the 1917 18 season with 44 goals in 20 games  12  The league nearly collapsed in January 1918 when the Montreal Arena burned down  causing the Wanderers to cease operations and forcing the Canadiens to hastily find a new arena  13  The NHL continued on as a three team league until Quebec returned in 1919  14  Montreal Canadiens in 1942 Toronto won the first league title  then defeated the Pacific Coast Hockey Association s Vancouver Millionaires to win the 1918 Stanley Cup 15  The Canadiens won the league title in 1919  however their Stanley Cup Final against the Seattle Metropolitans was abandoned with the series tied after several players became ill as a result of the Spanish Flu epidemic that resulted in Montreal defenceman Joe Hall s death  16  Montreal defeated the Calgary Tigers of the Western Canada Hockey League  WCHL  in 1924 to win their first Stanley Cup in the NHL  17  The Hamilton Tigers  who had relocated from Quebec in 1920  won the regular season title in 1924 25 but refused to play in the championship series unless they were given a C 200 bonus  18  The league refused and declared the Canadiens the league champion after they defeated the Toronto St  Patricks in the semi final  Montreal was then defeated by the Victoria Cougars for the 1925 Stanley Cup  It was the last time a non NHL team won the trophy  19  as the Stanley Cup became the de facto NHL championship in 1926 after the WCHL ceased operations  20  Team picture of the 1932 33 Stanley Cup champion New York Rangers autographed by club manager coach Lester Patrick The league embarked on rapid expansion in the 1920s  adding the Montreal Maroons and Boston Bruins in 1924  The Bruins were the first American team in the NHL  21  while the Maroons played in the newly completed Montreal Forum that the Canadiens made famous in later decades  22  The New York Americans began play in 1925 after purchasing the assets of the Hamilton Tigers  and were joined by the Pittsburgh Pirates  23 Tex Rickard  owner of Madison Square Garden  was so impressed with the popularity of the Americans that he added the New York Rangers in 1926  24  The Chicago Black Hawks and Detroit Cougars  later Red Wings  were also added after the league purchased the assets of the defunct WCHL  25 Conn Smythe purchased the Toronto St  Patricks in 1927  immediately renamed them the Maple Leafs  and built Maple Leaf Gardens in 1931  26  The Great Depression and the onset of World War II took a toll on the league  The Pirates became the Philadelphia Quakers in 1930  then folded one year later  The Senators likewise became the St  Louis Eagles in 1934  also lasting only one year  27  The Canadiens were nearly sold and relocated to Cleveland  Ohio in 1936 before a trio of local owners purchased the team and kept them in Montreal  28  The Maroons did not survive  however  as they suspended operations in 1938  29  The Americans were suspended in 1942 due to a lack of players  but never revived  30  The league was reduced to six teams for the 1942 43 NHL season  the Boston Bruins  Chicago Black Hawks  Detroit Red Wings  Montreal Canadiens  New York Rangers and Toronto Maple Leafs  These six teams remained constant for 25 years  a period known as the Original Six  The first NHL All Star Game was held in 1934 to benefit Ace Bailey  whose career ended on a vicious hit by Eddie Shore  31  The second was held in 1937 in support of Howie Morenz s family when he died of a coronary embolism after breaking his leg during a game  His teammate Aurel Joliat said that Morenz  died of a broken heart  when he learned he would never play hockey again  32 Maurice  Rocket  Richard became the first player to score 50 goals  doing so in a 50 game season  33  Ten years later he was suspended for the 1955 Stanley Cup playoffs for punching a linesman  an incident that led to the Richard Riot  34  He returned to lead the Canadiens to five consecutive titles between 1956 and 1960  a record no team has matched  35 Willie O Ree broke the NHL s colour barrier on January 18  1958 when he made his debut with the Boston Bruins and became the first black player in league history  36   edit  Expansion By the mid 1960s  the desire for a network television contract in the U S   and concerns that the Western Hockey League was planning to declare itself a major league and challenge for the Stanley Cup  spurred the NHL to undertake its first expansion since the 1920s  The league doubled in size for the 1967 68 season  adding the Los Angeles Kings  Minnesota North Stars  Philadelphia Flyers  Pittsburgh Penguins  California Seals and St  Louis Blues  37  Canadians were outraged that all six teams were placed in the United States  38  and the league responded by adding the Vancouver Canucks in 1970 along with the Buffalo Sabres  who are located on the U S  Canadian border  39  Two years later  the emergence of the newly founded World Hockey Association  WHA  led the league to add the New York Islanders and Atlanta Flames to keep the rival league out of those markets  40  In 1974  the Washington Capitals and Kansas City Scouts were added  bringing the league up to 18 teams  41  The NHL fought the WHA for players  losing 67 to the new league in its first season of 1972 73  42  including Bobby Hull  who signed a ten year   2 5 million contract with the Winnipeg Jets  the largest in hockey history at the time  43  The NHL attempted to block the defections in court  though a countersuit by the WHA led to a Philadelphia judge ruling the NHL s reserve clause to be illegal  eliminating the elder league s monopoly over the players  44  Seven years of battling for players and markets financially damaged both leagues  leading to a 1979 merger agreement that saw the WHA cease operations while the NHL absorbed the Jets  Edmonton Oilers  Hartford Whalers and Quebec Nordiques  45  Wayne Gretzky played one season in the WHA before joining the NHL in 1979 80 with the Oilers  46  He went on to lead the Oilers to four Stanley Cup championships in 1984  1985  1987 and 1988  and set single season records for goals  92 in 1981 82   assists  163 in 1985 86  and points  215 in 1985 86   as well as career records for goals  894   assists  1 963  and points  2 857   46  He was traded to the Kings in 1988  a deal that dramatically improved the NHL s popularity in the United States  and provided the impetus for the 1990s expansion cycles that saw the addition of the San Jose Sharks  Tampa Bay Lightning  Ottawa Senators  Mighty Ducks of Anaheim  Florida Panthers  Nashville Predators  Atlanta Thrashers  Minnesota Wild and Columbus Blue Jackets  47   edit  Labour issues History of the NHL National Hockey League Founding  1917 1942  Original Six  1942 1967  Expansion era  1967 1992  Modern era  1992 present  Ice hockey portal v t e There have been three league wide work stoppages in NHL history  all happening between 1992 and 2005  The first was a strike by the National Hockey League Players Association in April 1992 which lasted for 10 days  but the strike was settled quickly and all affected games were rescheduled  48  A lockout at the start of the 1994 95 season forced the league to reduce the schedule from 84 games to just 48  with the teams playing only intra conference games during the reduced season  48  The resulting collective bargaining agreement was set for renegotiation in 1998 and extended to September 15  2004  49  With no new agreement in hand when the existing contract expired on September 15  2004  league commissioner Gary Bettman announced a lockout of the players union and cessation of operations by the NHL head office  49  The lockout shut down the league for 310 days  the longest in sports history  the NHL was the first professional sports league to lose an entire season  49  The league vowed to install what it dubbed  cost certainty  for its teams  but the NHL Players Association countered that the move was little more than a euphemism for a salary cap  which the union initially said it would not accept  A new collective bargaining agreement was ratified in July 2005 with a term of six years with an option of extending the collective bargaining agreement for an additional year at the end of the term  allowing the NHL to resume as of the 2005 06 season  49  On October 5  2005  the first post lockout NHL season took to the ice with 15 games  and consequently all 30 teams  Of those 15 games  11 were in front of sell out crowds  50  The NHL received record attendance in the 2005 06 season  20 854 169 fans  an average of 16 955 per game  was a 1 2  increase over the previous mark held in the 2001 02 season  51  Also  the Montreal Canadiens  Calgary Flames  Colorado Avalanche  Minnesota Wild  Tampa Bay Lightning  and the Vancouver Canucks sold out all of their home games  51  52  all six Canadian teams played to 98  capacity or better at every home game  51  24 of the 30 clubs finished even or ahead of their 2003 04 mark  The Pittsburgh Penguins had the highest increase at 33   mainly because of 18 year old first overall draft pick Sidney Crosby  51  53  After losing a season to a labour dispute in 2005  attendance figures for League teams have returned to solid ground  the League s TV audience was slower to rebound because of ESPN s decision to drop the sport from its schedule  54  The NHL s post lockout agreement with NBC gave the league a share of revenue from each game s advertising sales  rather than the usual lump sum paid up front for game rights  The NHL is estimated to earn annual revenue of around  2 27 billion  54  The debut of the Winter Classic  an outdoor regular season NHL game held on New Year s Day 2008  was a major success for the league  The game has since become a permanent staple of the NHL schedule  This  along with the transition to a national  Game of the Week  and an annual  Hockey Day in America  regional coverage  has helped increase the NHL s regular season television viewership  which is now carried by NBC and Versus  These improvements led NBC and Versus to sign a ten year broadcast deal paying  200 million per year for both cable and broadcast rights  the deal will lead to further increases in television coverage on both outlets   edit  Organizational structure The NHL Board of Governors is the ruling and governing body of the NHL  In this context  each NHL team is a member of the NHL  and each member appoints a Governor  usually the owner of the club   and two alternates to the Board  The current chairman of the Board is Boston Bruins owner  Jeremy Jacobs  The NHL Board of Governors exists to establish the policies of the NHL  and to uphold its constitution  Some of the responsibilities of the NHL Board of Governors include 55   review and approve any rule changes to the game hiring and firing of the NHL commissioner review and approve the purchase  sale  or relocation of any member club  review and approve the salary caps for member clubs  review and approve any changes to the structure of the game schedule The Board of Governors meets twice per year  in June and December  with the exact date and place to be fixed by the NHL Commissioner   edit  Executives

battling for the puck against Calgary Flames  Daymond Langkow  December 21  2005  Main article  Ice hockey Each National Hockey League regulation game is played between two teams and is 60 minutes long  The game is composed of three 20 minute periods with an intermission of either 15  or 17 minutes  if nationally televised  between periods  56  Television timeouts are taken at the first stoppage of play after 6  10  and 14 minutes of elapsed time unless there is a power play or the first stoppage is the result of a goal scored  In these cases  the timeout will occur at the first stoppage after the penalty expires or the next stoppage after the goal  respectively  A new rule was introduced for the 2007 08 season that if the first stoppage of play is an icing  the TV timeout does not occur  This is to prevent players from getting a break despite not being allowed to change  At the end of the 60 minute regulation time  the team with the most goals wins the game  If a game is tied after regulation time  overtime ensues  During the regular season  overtime is a five minute  four player on four player sudden death period  in which the first team to score a goal wins the game  Until the 2005 06 season  if no team was able to score in the five minute overtime  the game ended in a tie  Beginning in the 2005 06 season  if the game is still tied at the end of overtime  the game enters a shootout  Three players for each team in turn take a penalty shot  The team with the most goals during the three round shootout wins the game  If the game is still tied after the three shootout rounds  the shootout continues but becomes sudden death  Whichever team ultimately wins the shootout is awarded a goal in the game score and thus awarded two points in the standings  The losing team in overtime or shootout is awarded only one  57  Shootout goals and saves are not tracked in hockey statistics  shootout statistics are tracked separately  Shootouts do not occur during the playoffs  In the playoffs  sudden death 20 minute five on five periods are played until one team scores  While in theory a game could continue indefinitely  only four games have reached five overtime periods  two have reached six  and none have gone beyond six  58  There are no television timeouts during playoff overtime periods  the only break is to clean the loose ice at the first stoppage after the period is halfway finished  59   edit  Hockey rink Diagram of an NHL hockey rink  1  penalty boxes 2  team benches 3  scorekeepers  area  Main article  Hockey rink National Hockey League games are played on a rectangular hockey rink with rounded corners surrounded by walls and plexiglass  It measures 25 91 by 60 92 metres  85 by 200 ft  in the NHL  60  approximately the same length but much narrower than International Ice Hockey Federation standards  The center line divides the ice in half  61  and is used to judge icing violations  There are two blue lines that divide the rink roughly into thirds  which divide the ice into two attacking and one neutral zone  61  Near the end of both ends of the rink  there is a thin red goal line spanning the width of the ice  which is used to judge goals and icing calls  Starting in the 2005 2006 season  after testing in the American Hockey League  a trapezoidal area behind each goal net has been introduced  62  The goaltender can only play the puck within the area between the trapezoids or in front of the goal line  if the goaltender plays the puck behind the goal line and outside the trapezoidal area  a two minute minor penalty for delay of game is assessed by the referees  63   edit  Rules Main articles  National Hockey League rules While the National Hockey League follows the general rules of ice hockey  it differs slightly from those used in international games organized by the International Ice Hockey Federation  IIHF  such as the Olympics  Infractions of the rules can lead to either the stoppage of play in the case of offside and icing calls  or a penalty call for more serious infractions  During the 2004 05 lockout  the league changed some of the rules regarding being offside  First  the league removed the  offside pass  or  two line pass  rule  which required a stoppage in play if a pass originating from inside a team s defending zone was completed on the offensive side of the center line  unless the puck crossed the line before the player  64  Furthermore  the league reinstated the  tag up offside  which allows an attacking player a chance to get back onside by returning to the neutral zone  64  The changes to the offside rule were among several rule changes intended to increase overall scoring  64  which had been in decline since the expansion years of the mid nineties and the increased prevalence of the neutral zone trap  Another rule difference between the NHL and the IIHF rules concerns how icings are called  In the NHL  a linesman stops play due to icing if a defending player  other than the goaltender  touches the puck before an attacking player is able to  65  in contrast to the IIHF rules where play is stopped the moment the puck crosses the goal line  As a result of the rule changes following the 2004 05 lockout  when a team is guilty of icing the puck they are not allowed to make a line change  or skater substitution of any sort  except for a clearly injured player  before the following faceoff  65  The NHL and IIHF differ also in penalty rules  The NHL  in addition to the minor and double minor penalties called in IIHF games  calls major penalties which are more dangerous infractions of the rules  such as fighting  and have a duration of five minutes  66  This is in contrast to the IIHF rule  in which players who fight are ejected from the game  67  Usually a penalized team cannot replace a player that is penalized on the ice and is thus shorthanded for the duration of the penalty  68  but if the penalties are coincidental  for example when two players fight  both teams remain at full strength  Also  unlike minor penalties  major penalties must be served to their full completion  regardless of number of goals scored during the power play  68  The NHL and the NHLPA created a stringent anti doping policy in the new CBA of September 2005  The policy provides for a 20 game suspension for a first positive test  a 60 game suspension for a second positive test  and a lifetime suspension for a third positive test  69   edit  Teams Devils Islanders Rangers Flyers Penguins Bruins Sabres Canadiens Senators

League originated in 1917 with four Canadian teams  which after a tumultous first quarter century  found stability in the Original Six era spanning 1942 1967 with four franchises in the United States joining two Canadian clubs  Through a sequence of team expansions  reductions  and relocations the NHL currently consists of 30 teams  23 of which are based in the United States and seven in Canada  The Montreal Canadiens are the most successful franchise with 24 Stanley Cup championships  23 as an NHL team  1 as an NHA team   in the four major professional sports leagues the Montreal Canadiens are only surpassed in the number of championships by the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball  who have three more  The next most successful franchise is the Toronto Maple Leafs with 13 Stanley Cup championships  but they have not won one since 1967  The Detroit Red Wings  with 11 Stanley Cup championships  are the most successful American franchise  The longest streak of winning the Stanley Cup in consecutive years is five  held by the Montreal Canadiens from 1955 56 to 1959 60  the New York Islanders  1980 1983  and the Montreal Canadiens  1976 1979  have four year championship streaks  70  The 1977 edition of the Montreal Canadiens  the second of four straight Stanley Cup champions  was named by ESPN as the second greatest sports team of all time  71  Of all the major leagues in North America  the NHL is the only league to field teams that play in two countries  capital cities  Ottawa  Ontario and Washington  D C  The current league organization divides the teams into two conferences  the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference  Each conference has three divisions  and each division has five teams  The current organization has roots in the 1998 99 season when a league realignment added two divisions to bring the total number of divisions to six  the current team alignment began with the 2000 01 season when the Minnesota Wild and the Columbus Blue Jackets joined the league as expansion teams  Sixteen of the NHL s thirty teams are located in the Eastern Time Zone  Currently  the Detroit Red Wings and Columbus Blue Jackets are the only Eastern Time teams in the Western Conference  and Winnipeg is the only non Eastern Time team in the Eastern Conference  an alignment resulting from the franchise s late move out of Atlanta   The NHLPA denied consent for a conference realignment for the 2012 13 season on January 6  2012   edit  List of teams Division Team City Area Arena Founded Joined Head Coach Captain Eastern Conference Atlantic New Jersey Devils

defunct and relocated National Hockey League teams There have been 19 NHL teams that either folded or relocated  The first team to disband was the Montreal Wanderers in 1918  due to their arena burning down a mere four games into the season  The blaze destroyed all the team s equipment  and as a consequence the players were dispersed among the three remaining teams  72  The first team to relocate was the Quebec Athletic Club  who relocated to Hamilton  Ontario in 1920 to become the Hamilton Tigers  NHL president Frank Calder stripped the franchise from owner Mike Quinn and sold it to a Hamilton based company  73  Three franchises succumbed to the economic pressures of the Great Depression  the Philadelphia Quakers  St  Louis Eagles  and Montreal Maroons  The Brooklyn Americans were the last team to fold in the NHL  In the early 1940s  the franchise was struggling financially  and was suspended prior to the 1942 43 season due to a lack of players during World War II  The franchise formally ceased operations in 1946  74  and their demise began a period in the league s history known as the  Original Six   The 1967 NHL expansion added six teams  but one of those teams  the California Golden Seals  moved to become the Cleveland Barons before merging with the Minnesota North Stars in 1978 when both clubs were on the verge of folding  With six more expansion teams in the 1970s  and the 1979 NHL WHA merger  the league had 21 teams at the end of the decade  Three of the four teams from the merger have since relocated to other cities  the Quebec Nordiques  the original Winnipeg Jets  and the Hartford Whalers  75  The Nordiques became the Colorado Avalanche in 1995  while the Jets became the Phoenix Coyotes in 1996  with the Whalers becoming the Carolina Hurricanes a year later  76  During the 2010 11 playoffs  the Atlanta Thrashers franchise was acquired by True North Sports and Entertainment  who moved the team to Winnipeg for 2011 12  giving the team the revived name Winnipeg Jets  77   edit  Season structure See also  List of NHL seasons and Season structure of the NHL The National Hockey League season is divided into an exhibition season  September   a regular season  from the first week in October through early to mid April  and a postseason  the Stanley Cup playoffs   During the exhibition season  teams may play other teams from the NHL  They also often compete against European clubs  such as clubs from the Russian KHL  During the regular season  clubs play each other in a predefined schedule  The Stanley Cup playoffs  which go from April to the beginning of June  is an elimination tournament where two teams play against each other to win a best of seven series in order to advance to the next round  The final remaining team is crowned the Stanley Cup champion  Beginning in 2007  the NHL regular season has begun in Europe while teams not involved complete their pre season exhibition schedule  In the regular season  each team plays 82 games  41 games at home and 41 on the road  Each team plays 24 games in its division six against each divisional opponent and 40 games against non divisional intra conference opponents four games against every team in the other two divisions of its conference  Each team plays every team in the other conference at least once one game each against 12 teams and two games against the remaining three teams  For three seasons between 2005 and 2008  teams played 32 games within their division eight games against each team in the division and 10 inter conference games one game against each team in two of the three divisions in the opposite conference  78  The two divisions faced from the opposite conference were rotated every year  much like interleague play in Major League Baseball  As with the current system  each team played four games against the other ten teams in its conference outside of its division  The NHL s regular season standings are based on a point system instead of winning percentages  Points are awarded for each game  where two points are awarded for a win  one point for losing in overtime or a shootout  and zero points for a loss in regulation  At the end of the regular season  the team that finishes with the most points in each division is crowned the division champion  The league s overall leader is awarded the Presidents  Trophy  The three division champions along with the five other teams in each conference with the next highest number of points  for a total of eight teams in each conference  qualify for the playoffs  The division winners are seeded one through three  even if a non division winner has a higher point total   and the next five teams with the best records in the conference are seeded four through eight  79  The Stanley Cup playoffs is an elimination tournament  where the teams are grouped in pairs to play best of seven series  the winners moving on to the next round  The first round of the playoffs  or conference quarter finals  consists of the first seed playing the eighth seed  the second playing the seventh  third playing the sixth  and the fourth playing the fifth  79  In the second round  or conference semi finals  the NHL re seeds the teams  with the top remaining conference seed playing against the lowest remaining seed  and the other two remaining conference teams pairing off  In the third round  the conference finals  the two remaining teams in each conference play each other  with the conference champions proceeding to the Stanley Cup Finals  In each round the higher ranked team is awarded home ice advantage  Four of the seven games are played at this team s home venue the first and second  and  when necessary  the fifth and seventh games with the other games played at the lower ranked team s home venue  In the Stanley Cup Finals  the team with the most points during the regular season is given home ice advantage  regardless of where each team ranks in their own conference   edit  Proposed conference realignment Devils Islanders Rangers Flyers Penguins Bruins Sabres Canadiens Senators Maple Leafs Jets Hurricanes Panthers Lightning Capitals Blackhawks Blue Jackets Red Wings Predators Blues Flames Avalanche Oilers Wild Canucks Ducks Stars Kings Coyotes Sharks On December 5  2011  the NHL Board of Governors approved a conference realignment plan that would eliminate the current six division setup and move into a four conference structure 80  Under the new plan  which was designed to better accommodate the effects of time zone differences  each team would have played 36 or 38 intra conference games  depending on whether it is in a seven  or eight team conference  and two games  home and road  against each non conference team  On January 6  2012  the league announced that the NHL Player s Association had rejected the proposed realignment  citing concerns about fairness  travel and the inability to see a draft schedule before approving  and that as a result  it would not implement the realignment until at least 2013 14  81  82  The unnamed conferences would have aligned as follows  Anaheim Ducks Calgary Flames Colorado Avalanche

List of Stanley Cup champions Main article  National Hockey League awards Stanley Cup  on display at the Hockey Hall of Fame  is awarded to the league champion  The National Hockey League presents a number of trophies each year  The most prestigious team award is the Stanley Cup  which is awarded to the league champion at the end of the Stanley Cup playoffs  The team that has the most points in the regular season is awarded the Presidents  Trophy  There are also numerous trophies that are awarded to players based on their statistics during the regular season  they include  among others  the Art Ross Trophy for the league scoring champion  goals and assists   the Maurice  Rocket  Richard Trophy for the goal scoring leader  and the William M  Jennings Trophy for the goalkeeper s  for the team with the fewest goals against them  The other player trophies are voted on by the Professional Hockey Writers  Association or the team general managers  83  These individual awards are presented at a formal ceremony held in late June after the playoffs have concluded  The most prestigious individual award is the Hart Memorial Trophy which is awarded annually to the Most Valuable Player  the voting is conducted by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association to judge the player who is the most valuable to his team during the regular season  The Vezina Trophy is awarded annually to the person deemed the best goalkeeper as voted on by the general managers of the teams in the NHL  The James Norris Memorial Trophy is awarded annually to the National Hockey League s top defenceman  the Calder Memorial Trophy is awarded annually to the top rookie  and the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy is awarded to the player deemed to combine the highest degree of skill and sportsmanship  all three of these awards are voted on by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association  In addition to the regular season awards  the Conn Smythe Trophy is awarded annually to the most valuable player during the NHL s Stanley Cup playoffs  Furthermore  the top coach in the league wins the Jack Adams Award as selected by a poll of the National Hockey League Broadcasters Association  The National Hockey League publishes the names of the top three vote getters for all awards  and then names the award winner during the NHL Awards Ceremony  83  The Hockey Hall of Fame in downtown Toronto One interesting aspect for the trophies in the NHL is that the same trophy is reused every year for each of its awards  The Stanley Cup  much like its CFL counterpart  is unique in this aspect  as opposed to the Vince Lombardi Trophy  Larry O Brien Trophy  and Commissioner s Trophy  which have new ones made every year for that year s champion  Despite only one trophy being used  the names of the teams winning and the players are engraved every year on the Stanley Cup  The same can also be said for the other trophies reissued every year  Players  coaches  officials  and team builders who have had notable careers are eligible to be voted into the Hockey Hall of Fame  Players cannot enter until three years have passed since their last professional game  the shortest such time period of any major sport  One unique consequence has been Hall of Fame members  specifically  Gordie Howe  Guy Lafleur  and Mario Lemieux  coming out of retirement to play once more  84  If a player was deemed significant enough  the three year wait would be waived  only ten individuals have been honoured in this manner  85  In 1999  Wayne Gretzky joined the Hall and became the last player to have the three year restriction waived  85  After his induction  the Hall of Fame announced that Gretzky would be the last to have the waiting period waived   edit  Notable active players The top five point scorers in the 2010 11 season were Daniel Sedin  104   Martin St  Louis  99   Corey Perry  98   Henrik Sedin  94   and Steven Stamkos  91   The top goal scorers were Corey Perry  50   Steven Stamkos  45   Jarome Iginla  43   Daniel Sedin  41   and Ryan Kesler  41   The top four scoring defencemen were Lubomir Visnovsky  Nicklas Lidstrom  Keith Yandle  and Dustin Byfuglien  The top goaltenders  by wins  were Roberto Luongo  38   Carey Price  38   Miikka Kiprusoff  37   Cam Ward  37   and Jimmy Howard  37    edit  Origin of players Wayne Gretzky in a New York Rangers uniform in 1997  In addition to Canadian and American born and trained players  who have historically composed a large majority of NHL rosters  the NHL also draws players from an expanding pool of other nations where organized and professional hockey is played  A steady stream of European players began entering the league in the 1970s  continuing into the 1980s  Most of the first wave of Europeans came from Sweden and Finland  with a small number of defectors from the Soviet Bloc  Since the collapse of the Soviet Bloc  political ideological restrictions on the movement of hockey players from this region have disappeared  leading to a large influx of players mostly from Czech Republic  Slovakia and Russia into the NHL  Swedes  Finns  and other Western Europeans  who were always free to move to North America  came to the league in greater numbers than before  Many of the league s top players today come from these European countries  including  Ilya Kovalchuk  Henrik Sedin  Daniel Sedin  Henrik Lundqvist  Marian Hossa  Nicklas Lidstrom  Marian Gaborik  Teemu Selanne  Zdeno Chara  Pavel Datsyuk  Evgeni Malkin  and Alexander Ovechkin  86  European players were drafted and signed by NHL teams in an effort to bring in more  skilled offensive players   87  although recently there has been a decline in European players as more American players enter the league  88  The addition of European players changed the style of play in the NHL and European style hockey has been integrated in to the NHL game  86  Conversely Canadian coaches and the Canadian style of play have been embraced by many European countries  Because of the continued success of Canadian teams in world tournaments many other countries are trying to model their development programs after Hockey Canada s  89  In the 1998  2002  2006 and 2010 Winter Olympic years  the league voluntarily suspended its all star game and expanded the traditional all star break to allow NHL players an opportunity to represent their respective countries  The 2010 Winter Olympics were held in Vancouver  an NHL city  Currently  as of late 2010 there is no agreement in place between the NHL and the IOC regarding the 2014 Winter Olympic games in Russia  90  The NHL has players from 18 different countries  with the majority  52 0 percent during the 2007 08 NHL season  coming from Canada  91  The following table shows the origins of every player  skaters and goaltenders  who played an NHL regular season game in the given year  The table follows the Hockey Hall of Fame convention of classifying players by the currently

statistical leaders by country  edit  Television and radio  edit  Canada In Canada  National Hockey League games are aired nationally by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation  CBC  and The Sports Network  TSN   CBC airs Hockey Night in Canada  a long standing Canadian tradition dating to 1952  108  109  and even prior to that on radio since the 1920s  The current incarnation of Hockey Night in Canada airs a weekly Saturday night double header during the regular season  with the first game usually featuring at least one Eastern Canadian team  and the second game at least one Western Canadian team  TSN usually televises three or four games per week during the regular season  with their primary night being Wednesdays  Coverage of the first three rounds of the playoffs is split between CBC and TSN  with the former primarily televising any series involving Canadian teams  CBC also broadcasts the Stanley Cup Finals  French language games are broadcast by the R seau des sports  RDS  and R seau Info Sports  RIS   including all Montreal Canadiens games  selected Ottawa Senators games  and the playoffs  Games not aired by CBC or TSN are aired regionally within a team s home market  Sportsnet holds regional broadcasting rights to all but two of the NHL s Canadian franchises   regional rights for the Montreal Canadiens and Winnipeg Jets are held by TSN  who airs the games on regional part time channels   edit  United States Historically  the NHL has never fared well on American television in comparison to the other American professional leagues  While CBC s aforementioned Hockey Night in Canada has been a tradition since the 1950s  the league s American broadcast partners have been in constant flux for decades  ranging from such networks as CBS  SportsChannel America  the USA Network  Fox  ABC  and ESPN  Since the 2005 06 season however  NHL games have aired nationally by the cable channel NBC Sports Network  previously the  Outdoor Life Network  and  Versus   and by the broadcast network NBC  110  Originally  NBC had a revenue sharing agreement with the league to broadcast games  with no money paid up front by the network  110  Versus had about 20 million fewer subscribers than ESPN when the NHL started on Versus  but its owner Comcast switched Versus from a digital tier to basic cable to make NHL games available to more cable subscribers as well as re branded the network as a sports network  110  For Versus  the NHL coverage was a good addition as Versus  ratings grew by about 275  when it showed an NHL game  In January 2011  Comcast officially acquired NBC Universal  and then in April of that year the league negotiated a new 10 year deal with the merged media company  worth nearly  2 billion dollars  Comcast NBC also announced that Versus would become NBC Sports Network  and both the cable channel and NBC would increase its number of games  111  As in Canada  games not broadcast nationally are aired regionally within a team s home market  These regional broadcasters include several of the regional sports networks owned by Comcast SportsNet and Fox Sports Net  XM Satellite Radio is the official satellite radio broadcaster of the NHL  as of July 1  2007  112  Between September 2005 and June 2007  the NHL s broadcasting rights were shared with both XM and Sirius Satellite Radio and were broadcast on just Sirius before the NHL lockout  XM used to broadcast more than 80  of NHL games  including all the play offs and finals  Starting with the 2007 08 season  XM broadcasts every game   edit  NHL Network Main articles  NHL

NHL is considered one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America  along with Major League Baseball  the National Football League  and the National Basketball Association  The league is very prominent in Canada  where hockey is the most popular of these four major sports as well as the CFL  118  Overall  hockey has the smallest total fan base of the four leagues  the smallest revenue from television  and the least sponsorship  119  While the NHL does not hold one of the largest fan bases in North America  it does hold one of the most affluent fan bases  119  Studies by the Sports Marketing Group conducted from 1998 to 2004 show that the NHL s fan base is much more affluent than that of the PGA Tour  120  A study done by the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 2004  found that NHL fans in America were the most educated and affluent of the four major leagues  They were also found to be substantially more computer literate than the other fans  Further it noted that season ticket sales were more prominent in the NHL than the other three because of the ability of the NHL fan to purchase them  something more out of reach for fans of the other leagues  119  According to Reuters in 2010  the largest demographic of NHL fans was highly sought after group males aged 18 34  who were also shown to be more  tech savvy  than most fans  121  The NHL estimates that fully half of its fan base roots for teams in outside markets  Beginning in 2008  under the direction of Chief Operating Officer John Collins  the NHL began a shift toward using digital technology to market to fans to capitalize on this  This has boosted viewership metrics for the NHL  The 2010 Stanley Cup play offs saw the largest audience in the history of the sport  after a regular season that saw record breaking business success  propelled in large part by the NHL s strategy of engaging fans through big events and robust digital offerings   122  This success has resulted in a 66 percent rise in NHL advertising and sponsorship revenue  Collins said  It was a great Stanley Cup run  really across every possible metric      Our fans are consuming more hockey   Merchandise sales were up 22 percent and the number of unique visitors on the NHL com website were up 17 percent during the playoffs after rising 29 percent in the regular season  123   edit  Causes
