United States include water scarcity  pollution  a backlog of investment  concerns about the affordability of water for the poorest  and a rapidly retiring workforce  Increased variability and intensity of rainfall as a result of climate change is expected to produce both more severe droughts and flooding  with potentially serious consequences for water supply and for pollution from combined sewer overflows  8  9  Droughts are likely to particularly affect the 66 percent of Americans whose communities depend on surface water  10  As for drinking water quality  there are concerns about disinfection by products  lead  perchlorates and pharmaceutical substances  but generally drinking water quality in the U S  is good  Cities  utilities  state governments and the federal government have addressed the above issues in various ways  To keep pace with demand from an increasing population  utilities traditionally have augmented supplies  However  faced with increasing costs and droughts  water conservation is beginning to receive more attention and is being supported through the federal WaterSense program  The reuse of treated wastewater for non potable uses is also becoming increasingly common  Pollution through wastewater discharges  a major issue in the 1960s  has been brought largely under control  Most Americans are served by publicly owned water and sewer utilities  Eleven percent of Americans receive water from private  so called  investor owned   utilities  In rural areas  cooperatives often provide drinking water  Finally  up to 15 percent of Americans are served by their own wells  11  12  Water supply and wastewater systems are regulated by state governments and the federal government  At the state level  health and environmental regulation is entrusted to the corresponding state level departments  Public Utilities Commissions or Public Service Commissions regulate tariffs charged by private utilities  In some states they also regulate tariffs by public utilities  At the federal level  drinking water quality and wastewater discharges are regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency  which also provides funding to utilities through State Revolving Funds  13  14  15  Water consumption in the United States is more than double that in Central Europe  with large variations among the states  In 2002 the average American family spent  474 on water and sewerage charges  2  which is about the same level as in Europe  The median household spent about 1 1 percent of its income on water and sewerage  16

outbreaks of disease  including cholera in 1832  1849 and 1866 and typhoid in 1848  17  The fast growing cities did not have sewers and relied on contaminated wells within the city confines for drinking water supply  In the mid 19th century many cities built centralized water supply systems  However  initially these systems provided raw river water without any treatment  Only after John Snow established the link between contaminated water and disease in 1854 and after authorities became gradually convinced of that link  water treatment plants were added and public health improved  Sewers were built since the 1850s  initially based on the erroneous belief that bad air  miasma theory  caused cholera and typhoid  It took until the 1890s for the now universally accepted germ theory of disease to prevail  However  most wastewater was still discharged without any treatment  because wastewater was not believed to be harmful to receiving waters due to the natural dilution and self purifying capacity of rivers  lakes and the sea  Wastewater treatment only became widespread after the introduction of federal funding in 1948 and especially after an increase in environmental consciousness and the upscaling of financing in the 1970s  For decades federal funding for water supply and sanitation was provided through grants to local governments  After 1987 the system was changed to loans through revolving funds   edit  Piped water supply until 1948 In the 1840s and 1850s the largest cities in the U S  built pipelines to supply drinking water from rivers or lakes  However  the drinking water was initially not treated  since the link between waterborne pathogens and diseases was not yet well known  In 1842 New York City was one of the first cities in the U S  to tap water resources outside the city limits  It dammed the Croton River in Westchester County  New York  and built an aqueduct from the reservoir to the city  18  Also in 1842  construction was completed on Chicago s first water works  with water mains made of cedar and a water intake located about 150 feet  46 m  into Lake Michigan  19  In 1848  Boston began construction of a water transmission system  A tributary of the Sudbury River was impounded creating Lake Cochituate  from where the Cochituate Aqueduct transported water to the Brookline Reservoir that fed the city s distribution system  20  In 1853 Washington  DC  followed suit by beginning the construction of the Washington Aqueduct to provide water from the Great Falls on the Potomac River  In 1854  the British physician John Snow found that cholera was spread through contaminated water  As a result of his findings  several cities began to treat all water with sand filters and chlorine before distributing it to the public  Cities also began to construct sewers  21  As a result of water treatment and sanitation  the incidence of cholera and typhoid rapidly decreased  Slow sand filtration was initially the technology of choice for water treatment  later being gradually displaced by rapid sand filtration  In the arid American Southwest  the water demand of rapidly growing cities such as Los Angeles exceeded local water availability  requiring the construction of large pipelines to bring in water from far away sources  The most spectacular example is the first Los Angeles Aqueduct built between 1905 and 1913 to supply water from the Owens Valley over a distance of 375 km   edit  Sanitation until 1948 Most of the first sewer systems in the United States were built as combined sewers  carrying both storm water and sewerage   They discharged into rivers  lakes and the sea without any treatment  The main reason for choosing combined sewers over separate systems  separating sanitary sewers from storm water drains  was a belief that combined sewer systems were cheaper to build than separate systems  Also  there was no European precedent for successful separate sewer systems at the time  17  The first large scale sewer systems in the United States were constructed in Chicago and Brooklyn in the late 1850s  followed by other major U S  cities  17  Few wastewater treatment facilities were constructed in the late 19th century to treat combined wastewater because of the associated difficulties  There were only 27 U S  cities with wastewater treatment works by 1892  most of them  treating  wastewater through land application  Of these 27 cities  26 had separate sanitary and storm water sewer systems  thus facilitating wastewater treatment  because there was no need for large capacitites to accommodate wet weather flows  Furthermore  there was a belief that the diluted combined wastewater was not harmful to receiving waters  due to the natural dilution and self purifying capacity of rivers  lakes and the sea  17  In the early 20th century a debate evolved between those who thought it was in the best interest of public health to construct wastewater treatment facilities and those who believed building them was unnecessary  Nevertheless  many cities began to opt for separate sewer systems  creating favorable conditions for adding wastewater treatment plants in the future  17  Where wastewater was being treated it was typically discharged into rivers or lakes  However  in 1932  the first reclaimed water facility in the U S  was built in Golden Gate Park  San Francisco  for the reuse of treated wastewater in landscape irrigation  Sanitary sewers were not the only sanitation solution applied  They were particularly useful in high density urban areas  However  in some newly built lower density areas  decentralized septic systems were built  They were attractive because they reduced capital expenditures and had fewer operation and maintenance costs compared to wastewater treatment plants  17   edit  After 1948  Enter the federal government In the first half of the 20th century water supply and sanitation were a local government responsibility with regulation at the state level  the federal government played almost no role in the sector at that time  This changed with the enactment of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948  which provided for comprehensive planning  technical services  research  and financial assistance by the federal government to state and local governments for sanitary infrastructure  The Act was amended in 1965  establishing a uniform set of water quality standards and creating a Federal Water Pollution Control Administration authorized to set standards where states failed to do so  17  Comprehensive federal regulations for water supply and sanitation were introduced in the 1970s  in reaction to an increase in environmental concerns  In 1970 the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  was created  In 1972  the Clean Water Act was passed  requiring industrial plants to proactively improve their waste procedures in order to limit the effect of contaminants on freshwater sources  In 1974  the Safe Drinking Water Act was adopted for the regulation of public water systems  This law specified a number of contaminants that must be closely monitored and reported to residents should they exceed the maximum contaminant levels allowed  From then on  drinking water systems were closely monitored by federal  state  and municipal governments for safety and compliance with existing regulations  21  The Clean Water Act set the unprecedented goal of eliminating all water pollution by 1985 and authorized massive expenditures of  24 6 billion in research and construction grants  The funds initially provided an incentive to build centralized wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure instead of decentralized systems   17  However  the 1977 amendments to the Clean Water Act required communities to consider alternatives to the conventional centralized sewer systems  and financial assistance was made available  17  In the mid 1990s decentralized systems served approximately 25 percent of the U S  population  and approximately 37 percent of new housing developments  22  There were disagreements between the federal government and local government about the appropriate level of wastewater treatment  with the former arguing for more stringent standards  For example  in the late 1980s  the City of San Diego and the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  were involved in a legal dispute over the requirement to treat sewage at the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant to secondary standards  The City prevailed  saying that it saved ratepayers an estimated  3 billion and that process had proved successful in maintaining a healthy ocean environment  The city s Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant uses an advanced primary process  23  The requirement to perform secondary treatment on wastewater before ocean discharge was waived by the EPA in 1995   taking into account the city s unique circumstances   24  In 1987 Congress  through the Water Quality Act  passed an amendment of the Clean Water Act  abolishing construction grants and replacing them by a system of subsidized loans using the Clean Water State Revolving Fund  CWSRF   The intention at the time was to completely phase out federal funding after a few years  Funding peaked in 1991 and continued at high levels thereafter  despite the original intentions  New challenges arose  such as the need to address combined sewer overflows for which EPA issued a policy in 1994  In 1997 Congress established the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund  building on the success of the CWSRF  in order to finance investments to improve compliance with more stringent drinking water quality standards   edit  Technical and environmental overview This section provides a brief overview of the water supply and sanitation infrastructure in the U S   water sources of some of the main cities  and the main types of residential water use   edit  Infrastructure The centralized drinking water supply infrastructure in the United States consists of dams and reservoirs  well fields  pumping stations  aqueducts for the transport of large quantities of water over long distances  water treatment plants  reservoirs in the distribution system  including water towers   and 1 8 million miles of distribution lines  25  Depending on the location and quality of the water source  all or some of these elements may be present in a particular water supply system  In addition to this infrastructure for centralized network distribution  14 5  of Americans rely on their own water sources  usually wells  11  12  The centralized sanitation infrastructure in the U S  consists of 1 2 million miles of sewers   including both sanitary sewers and combined sewers    sewage pumping stations and 16 024 publicly owned wastewater treatment plants  26  In addition  at least 17  of Americans are served by on site sanitation systems such as septic tanks  27  Publicly owned wastewater treatment plants serve 189 7m people and treat 32 1bn gallons per day  26  9 388 facilities provide secondary treatment  4 428 facilities provide advanced treatment  and 2 032 facilities do not discharge  26  There are 176 facilities that provide a treatment level that is less than secondary  These include facilities with ocean discharge waivers  and treatment facilities discharging to other facilities meeting secondary treatment or better  880 facilities receive flows from combined sewer systems  26  About 772 communities in the U S  have combined sewer systems  serving about 40 million people  28   edit  Water sources The Wachusett Reservoir is a source of drinking water supply for Boston About 90  of public water systems in the U S  obtain their water from groundwater  However  since systems served by groundwater tend to be much smaller than systems served by surface water  only 34  of Americans  101 million  are supplied with treated groundwater  while 66   195 million  are supplied with surface water  10  For a surface water system to operate without filtration it has to fulfill certain criteria set by the EPA under its Surface Water Treatment Rule  including the implementation of a watershed control program  The water system of New York City has repeatedly fulfilled these criteria  29   edit  Cities supplied primarily by surface water without water treatment Boston  New York City  San Francisco  Portland  Oregon and Denver are among the large cities in the U S  that do not need to treat their surface water sources beyond disinfection  because their water sources are located in the upper reaches of protected watersheds and thus are naturally very pure  30  Boston receives most of its water from the Quabbin and Wachusett Reservoirs and the Ware River in central and western Massachusetts  New York City s water supply is fed by a 2 000 square mile  5 200 km2  watershed in the Catskill Mountains  The watershed is in one of the largest protected wilderness areas in the United States  31 San Francisco obtains 85  of its drinking water from high Sierra snowmelt through the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir in Yosemite National Park  32  However  to supplement the imported water supply  and to help maintain delivery of drinking water in the event of a major earthquake  drought or decline in the snowpack  San Francisco considers the use of alternative locally produced  sustainable water sources such as reclaimed water for irrigation  local groundwater and desalination during drought periods  all as part of its Water Supply Diversification Program  33  The largest source of water supply for Portland  Oregon  is the Bull Run Watershed  34 Denver receives its water almost entirely from mountain snowmelt in a number of highly protected watersheds in more than 9 counties  Its water is stored in 14 reservoirs  the largest of which is the Dillon Reservoir on the Blue River in the Colorado River  Water is diverted from there through the Harold D  Roberts Tunnel under the Continental Divide into the South Platte River Basin  35   edit  Cities supplied primarily by surface water with water treatment Lake Havasu on the Colorado River is the main source of drinking water for both Phoenix  Arizona and Los Angeles Cities that rely on more or less polluted surface water from the lower reaches of rivers have to rely on extensive and costly water purification plants  The Las Vegas metropolitan area  obtains 90  of its water from Lake Mead on the Colorado River  which has been affected by drought  36  To supply a portion of the future water supply  Las Vegas plans to buy water rights in the Snake Valley in White Pine County  250 mi  400 km  north of the city straddling the Utah border and other areas  pumping it to Las Vegas through a US 2 billion pipeline  37 Phoenix also obtains its drinking water primarily from the Colorado River further downstream at Lake Havasu through the Central Arizona Project  Los Angeles obtains about half of its drinking water from the Owens River and Mono Lake through the Los Angeles Aqueduct  38  with additional supplies from Lake Havasu through the Colorado River Aqueduct  39 San Diego imports nearly 90 percent of its water from other areas  specifically northern California and the Colorado River  40  The Schuylkill River provides 40  of the water used in Philadelphia The cities on the Mississippi River are supplied by water from that river except for Memphis  The metropolitan area of Atlanta receives 70  of its water from the Chattahoochee River and another 28  from the Etowah  Flint  Ocmulgee and Oconee rivers  41 Chicago is supplied by water from Lake Michigan and Detroit receives its water from the Detroit River  42 Philadelphia receives 60  of its water from the Delaware River and 40  from the Schuylkill River  43 Washington  DC receives its water from the Potomac River through the Washington Aqueduct  44   edit  Cities supplied primarily by groundwater The South Florida metropolitan area including Miami obtains its drinking water primarily from the Biscayne Aquifer  Given increasing water demand  Miami Dade County is considering the use of reclaimed water to help preserve the Biscayne Aquifer  45 Memphis receives its water from artesian aquifers  46   edit  Cities supplied by a mix of groundwater and surface water Seventy one percent of Houston s supply flows from the Trinity River into Lake Livingston  and from the San Jacinto River into Lake Conroe and Lake Houston  Deep underground wells drilled into the Evangeline and Chicot aquifers provide the other 29 percent of the city s water supply  47   edit  Water use Toilets account for 31  of indoor water use in the U S  Domestic water use  also called home or residential water use  in the United States was estimated by the United States Geological Survey at 29 4 billion US gallons  111 000 000 m3  per day in 2005  1  The bulk of domestic water is provided through public networks  13  or 3 8 billion US gallons  14 000 000 m3  of water is self supplied  1  The average domestic water use per person in the U S  is 98 US gallon  370 L  per day  1  This is about 2 5 times as high as in England  150 Liter  48  and three times as high as in Germany  126 Liter   49  50  One of the reasons for the high domestic water use in the U S  is the high share of outdoor water use  For example  the arid West has some of the highest per capita domestic water use  largely because of landscape irrigation  Per capita domestic water use varied from 51 US gallon  190 L  per day in Maine to 189 US gallon  720 L  per day in Nevada  1  According to a 1999 study  on average all over the U S  58  of domestic water use is outdoors for gardening  swimming pools etc  and 42  is used indoors  51  Indoor use falls into the following categories  31  Toilets 2  Baths 19  Showers 25  Clothes Washers 2  Dishwashers 18  Faucets 3  Other Domestic Uses 51  Only a very small share of public water supply is used for drinking  According to one 2002 survey of 1 000 households  an estimated 56  of Americans drank water straight from the tap and an additional 37  drank tap water after filtering it  52  74  of Americans said they bought bottled water  52  According to a non representative survey conducted among 216 parents  173 Latinos and 43 non Latinos   63  29   never drank tap water  The share is much higher among Latinos  34   than among non Latinos  12    The study concluded that many Latino families avoid drinking tap water because they fear it causes illness  resulting in greater cost for the purchase of bottled and filtered water  53  This notion is also repeated among Asians  53   edit  Institutional overview  edit  Service providers The California Aqueduct brings water from Northern to Southern California See also  List of United States water companies In 2007 there were about 52 000 community public water systems in the United States  which are either publicly owned  cooperatives or privately owned  6  serving a total of about 242 million people in 2000  54  Four thousand systems provide water in localities with more than 10 000 inhabitants  and the remaining 50 000 systems provide water in localities with less than 10 000 inhabitants  6  In 2000 15  of Americans  43 5 million people  relied on their own water source  usually a well  for drinking water  1  55  Utilities in charge of public water supply and sanitation systems can be owned  financed  operated and maintained by a public entity  a private company or both can share responsibilities through a public private partnership  Utilities can either be in charge of only water supply and or sanitation  or they can also be in charge of providing other services  in particular electricity and gas  In the latter case they are called multi utilities  Bulk water suppliers are entities that manage large aqueducts and sell either treated or untreated water to various users  including utilities  Public service providers  Eighty nine percent of Americans served by a public water system are served by a public or cooperative entity  56  57  Usually public systems are managed by utilities that are owned by a city or county  but have a separate legal personality  management and finances  Examples are the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority  the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Denver Water  In some cases public utilities span several jurisdictions  An example is the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission that spans two counties in Maryland  Utility cooperatives are a major provider of water services  especially in small towns and rural areas 58  59  Private utilities  About half of American drinking water utilities  or about 26 700  are privately owned  providing water to 11  of Americans served by public water systems  56  Most of the private utilities are small  but a few are large and are traded on the stock exchange  The largest private water company in the U S  is American Water  which serves 15 million customers in 1 600 communities in the U S  and Canada  60  It is followed by United Water  which serves 7 million customers and is owned by the French firm Suez Environnement  61  Overall  about 33 5 million Americans  11  of the population  get water from a privately owned drinking water utility  56  In addition  20  of all wastewater utilities in the U S  are privately owned  many of them relatively small  About 3  of Americans get wastewater service from private wastewater utilities  In addition  more than 1 300 government entities  typically municipalities  contract with private companies to provide water and or wastewater services  56  Multi utilities  Some utilities in the U S  provide only water and or sewer services  while others are multi utilities that also provide power and gas services  Examples of utilities that provide only water and sewer services are the Boston Water and Sewer Commission  Dallas Water Utilities  the New York City Department of Environmental Protection  Seattle Public Utilities and the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission  Other utilities  such as the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission  provide power in addition to water and sewer services  Other multi utilities provide power and water services  but no sewer services  such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the Orlando Utilities Commission  There are also some utilities that provide only sewer services  such as the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago or the sewer utility in the city of Santa Clara  62  The Central Arizona Project supplies water to 80 municipal  industrial  agricultural and Indian customers in Central and Southern Arizona Bulk water suppliers  There are also a few large bulk water suppliers in the arid Southwest of the United States  which sell water to utilities  The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California  MWD  sells treated water from the Colorado River and Northern California to its member utilities in Southern California through the California Aqueduct  Twenty six cities and water districts serving 18 million people are members of MWD  63  The Central Arizona Water Conservation district supplies water from the Colorado River to 80 municipal  industrial  agricultural and Indian customers in Central and Southern Arizona through the Central Arizona Project Aqueduct  CAP   64   edit  Regulators The economic regulation of water and sanitation service providers in the U S   in particular in relation to the setting of user water rates  is usually the responsibility of regulators such as Public Utility Commissions at the state level  which are organized in the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners  65   see economic regulator   However  while all investor owned utilities are subject to tariff regulation  only few public utilities are subjected to the same regulation  In fact  only 12 states have laws restricting pricing practices by public water and sanitation utilities  66  The environmental and drinking water quality regulation is the responsibility of state departments of health or environment and the EPA  67   edit  Other stakeholders There are a number of Professional associations  trade associations and other non governmental organizations  NGOs  that are actively engaged in water supply and sanitation  Professional associations include the American Water Works Association  AWWA  oriented mainly towards drinking water professionals and the Water Environment Federation  WEF  geared mainly at wastewater professionals  The geographical scope of both is greater than the U S   AWWA has members in 100 countries  68  with a focus on the U S  and Canada  and WEF has member associations in 30 countries  69  There are a number of trade associations in the sector  including  The National Association of Water Companies  NAWC   founded in 1895  which represents the interests of small and large private water and wastewater utilities  70  The National Association of Clean Water Agencies  NACWA   founded in 1970  which represents the interests of wastewater utilities  71  The National Rural Water Association  NRWA   founded in 1976  which represents small water and wastewater utilities  58  The Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies  AMWA   founded in 1981  which represents the interests of large publicly owned drinking water utilities  72  The Water Reuse Association  founded in 2000  which promotes water reclamation  recycling  reuse and desalination  73  The Water Quality Association represents manufacturers and dealers of equipment for water treatment  74  In addition to lobbying  some of these trade associations also provide public education  as well as training and technical assistance to their members  75  76  An example of an NGO active in water supply and sanitation is Food  amp  Water Watch  a consumer rights group created in 2005 which focuses on corporate and government accountability relating to food  water  and fishing  Another example is the Alliance for Water Efficiency  AWE   which was created in 2007 with seed funding from the EPA to  advocate for water efficiency research  evaluation  and education  at the national level  Its Board members  represent water utilities  environmental organizations  plumbing and appliance associations  irrigation manufacturers  the academic community  government  and others   77   edit  Issues Among the main issues facing water users and the water industry in the U S  in 2009 are water scarcity and adaptation to climate change  concerns about combined sewer overflows and drinking water quality  as well as concerns about a gap between investment needs and actual investments  Other issues are concerns about a swiftly retiring workforce  the affordability of water bills for the poor during a recession  and water fluoridation  which is opposed by some mainly on ethical and safety grounds   edit  Water scarcity and climate change With water use in the United States increasing every year  many regions are starting to feel the pressure  At least 36 states are anticipating local  regional  or statewide water shortages by 2013  even under non drought conditions  78  According to the National Academies  climate change affects water supply in the U S  in the following ways  Rising water demands  Hotter summers mean thirstier people and plants  In addition  more evaporation from reservoirs and irrigated farmland will lead to faster depletion of water supplies  Increased drought  Scientific evidence suggests that rising temperatures in the southwestern United States will reduce river flows and contribute to an increased severity  frequency  and duration of droughts  Seasonal supply reductions  Many utilities depend on winter snowpack to store water and then gradually release it through snowmelt during spring and summer  Warmer temperatures will accelerate snowmelt  causing the bulk of the runoff to occur earlier and potentially increasing water storage needs in these areas  9   edit  Pollution Sewer overflows  Combined sewer overflows  CSO  and sanitary sewer overflows affect the quality of water resources in many parts of the U S  About 772 communities have combined sewer systems  serving about 40 million people  mostly in the Northeast  the Great Lakes Region and the Pacific Northwest  28  CSO discharges during heavy storms can cause serious water pollution  A 2004 EPA report to Congress estimated that there are 9 348 CSO outflows in the U S   discharging about 850 billion US gallons  3 2 109 m3  of untreated wastewater and storm water to the environment  79  EPA estimates that between 23 000 and 75 000 sanitary sewer overflows occur each year  resulting in releases of between 3 and 10 billion US gallons  38 000 000 m3  of untreated wastewater  79  The increased frequency and intensity of rainfall as a result of climate change 8  80  will result in additional water pollution from wastewater treatment  storage  and conveyance systems   80  For the most part  wastewater treatment plants and combined sewer overflow control programs have been designed on the basis of the historic hydrologic record  taking no account of prospective changes in flow conditions due to climate change  80  Main article  Drinking water quality in the United States Drinking water quality  There are several aspects of drinking water quality that are of some concern in the United States  including Cryptosporidium  81 disinfection by products  lead  perchlorates and pharmaceutical substances  However  in almost all cases drinking water quality is in conformity with the norms of the Safe Drinking Water Act  which sets Maximum Contaminant Levels for pollutants  In addition  the EPA s Consumer Confidence Rule of 1998 requires most public water suppliers to provide consumer confidence reports  also known as annual water quality reports  to their customers  82  According to the EPA  each year by July 1 anyone connected to a public water system should receive in the mail an annual water quality report that tells where water in a specific locality comes from and what s in it  Consumers can find out about these local reports on a map provided by EPA  83  29  of Americans are reading their water quality reports  Customers are generally satisfied with the information they are receiving from their water companies and their local or state environmental offices  52   edit  Investment gap In its Infrastructure Report Card the American Society of Civil Engineers gave both the U S  drinking water and wastewater infrastructure a grade of D  in 2005  down from D in 2001  According to the report   the nation s drinking water system faces a staggering public investment need to replace aging facilities  comply with safe drinking water regulations and meet future needs   84  Investment needs are about  19 billion year for sanitation and  14 billion year for drinking water  totaling  33 billion year  85  State and local governments invested  28 5 billion in water supply and sanitation in 2005  split roughly half and half between water and sanitation  3  4  This implies an investment gap of  4 5 billion year  If tariff revenues remain constant in real terms  utilities face a funding gap of the same magnitude  However  the funding gap would disappear if municipalities increased water and sanitation spending at a real rate of growth of three percent per year  85  Concerning drinking water supply the EPA estimated in 2003 that  276 8 billion would have to be invested between 2003 and 2023  86  87  Concerning sanitation  the EPA estimated in 2007 that investment of  202 5 billion is needed over the next 20 years to control wastewater pollution  This includes  134 billion for wastewater treatment and collection   54 8 billion for resolving unsatisfactory combined sewer overflows and  9 billion for stormwater management  88  The EPA needs surveys do not capture all investment needs  in particular concerning capital replacement  85   edit  Access More than 99  of the U S  population has access to  complete plumbing facilities   defined as the following services within the housing unit  hot and cold piped water  bathtub or shower  and flush toilet  However  more than 1 7 million people in the United States  670 986 households  still lack basic plumbing facilities  More than a third of them have household incomes below the federal poverty level  They are spread across all racial and ethnic categories  but they are more prominent in the minority groups  Most of the people who lacked plumbing services were elderly  poor  and living in rural areas  Alaska has the highest percentage of households without plumbing   6 32 percent of all its households  89   edit  Pricing and affordability Water meters are a prerequisite for accurate  volumetric billing of water users The median household in the U S  spent about 1 1  of its income on water and sewerage in 2002  However  poor households face a different situation  In 1997 18  of U S  households  many of them poor  paid more than 4  of their income on their water and sewer bill  90  The mean U S  water tariff   excluding sewer tariffs   was  2 72 per 1 000 gallons   0 72 per cubic meter  in 2000  91  with significant variations between localities  Average residential water tariffs for a monthly consumption of 15 cubic meters varied between  0 35 per cubic meter in Chicago and  3 01 in Atlanta in 2007  The combined water and sewer tariff was  0 64 in Chicago and  3 01 in Atlanta  with Atlanta not charging separately for sewer services  92  Annual combined water and sewer bills vary between  228 in Chicago and  1 476 in Atlanta in 2008  93  For purposes of comparison  the average water and sewer bill in England and Wales in 2008 was equivalent to  466  94  The average annual increase in typical residential water bills was approximately 5 3 percent from 2001 through 2009  while the increase in typical residential sewer bills was approximately 5 5 percent according to data from the 50 Largest Cities Water and Wastewater Rate Survey by Black  amp  Veatch  95   edit  Retiring workforce The water community in the US is faced with a swiftly retiring workforce and a tightening market place for new workers  In 2008  approximately one third of executives and managers were expected to retire in the following five years  96  Water and sanitation utilities in the United States had 41 922 employees in 2002  97   edit  Fluoridation Water fluoridation  the controlled addition of moderate concentrations of fluoride to a public water supply to reduce tooth decay  is used for about two thirds of the U S  population on public water systems  98  Almost all major public health and dental organizations support water fluoridation  or consider it safe  99  Nevertheless it is contentious for ethical  safety  and efficacy reasons  100   edit  Responses to address issues  edit  Supply side management Historically the predominant response to increasing water demand in the U S  has been to tap into ever more distant sources of conventional water supply  in particular rivers  Because of environmental concerns and limitations in the availability of water resources  including droughts that may be due to climate change  this approach now is in many cases not feasible any more  Still  supply side management is often being pursued tapping into non conventional water resources  in particular seawater desalination in coastal areas with high population growth  California alone had plans to build 21 desalination plants in 2006 with a total capacity of 450 million US gallons  1 700 000 m3  per day  which would represent a massive 70 fold increase over current seawater desalination capacity in the state  101  In 2007 the largest desalination plant in the United States is the one at Tampa Bay  Florida  which began desalinating 25 million US gallons  95 000 m3  of water per day in December 2007  102  In 2005 over 2 000 desalination plants with a capacity of more than 100m3 day had been installed or contracted in every state in the U S  with a total capacity of more than 6 million m3 day  Only 7  of that capacity was for seawater desalination  while 51  used brackish water and 26  used river water as water source  103  The contracted capacity corresponds to 2 4  of total municipal and industrial water use in the country in 2000  104  The actual share of desalinated water is lower  because some of the contracted capacity was never built or never operated  was closed down or is not operated at full capacity  103   edit  Demand side management Demand side management  including the reduction of leakage in the distribution network and water conservation  are other options that are being considered and  in some cases  also applied to address water scarcity  For example  Seattle has reduced per capita water use from 152 US gallons  580 L  per day in 1990 to 97 US gallons  370 L  per day in 2007 through a comprehensive water conservation program including pricing policies  education  regulations and rebates for water saving appliances  Other cities such as Atlanta and Las Vegas have also launched water conservation programs that are somewhat less comprehensive than the one in Seattle concerning indoor water use  However  Las Vegas has intentionally focused on curbing outdoor water demand  which accounts for 70  of residential water use in the city  through reductions in turf area and incentives for the use of rains sensors  irrigation controllers and pool covers  105  At the federal level  the Energy Policy Act of 1992 set standards for water efficient appliances  replacing the 3 5 US gallons  13 L  per flush  gpf  toilet with a new 1 6 gpf 6 litres per flush maximum standard for all new toilets  By 1994  federal law mandated that showerheads and faucets sold in the U S  release no more than 2 5 and 2 2 US gallons  8 3 L  of water per minute respectively  106  Also in 1994 the AWWA established a clearinghouse for water conservation  efficiency  and demand management  called WaterWiser  to assist water conservation professionals and the general public in using water more efficiently  107  In 2006 the U S  Environmental Protection Agency launched the WaterSense program to encourage water efficiency beyond the standards set by the Energy Policy Act through the use of a special label on consumer products  108  109  Distributional losses in the U S  are typically 10 15  of total withdrawals  although they can exceed 25  of total water use in older systems  105  According to another source unaccounted for water  UFW    which includes system losses  water used for firefighting and water used in the treatment process   was estimated to be only 8  in systems with more than 500 000 connections in 2000  110  In comparison  the level of water losses is 7  in Germany  19  in England and Wales  and 26  in France  Together with Germany water losses in the U S  are thus among the lowest in 16 industrial countries  111  Low water tariffs and inappropriate tariff structures do not encourage water conservation  For example  decreasing block rates  under which the unit rate decreases with consumption  offer hardly any incentive for water conservation  In 2000 about 51  of water tariffs in the U S were uniform  i e  the unit tariff is independent of the level of consumption   12  were increasing block tariffs  the unit rate increases with consumption  and 19  were decreasing block tariffs  91  The use of decreasing block tariffs declined sharply from 45  of all tariff structures in 1992  66  Sewer rates are often flat rates that are not linked to consumption  thus offering no incentive to conserve water  105   edit  Water reuse Reuse of reclaimed water is an increasingly common response to water scarcity in many parts of the United States  Reclaimed water is being reused directly for various non potable uses in the United States  including urban landscape irrigation of parks  school yards  highway medians and golf courses  fire protection  commercial uses such as vehicle washing  industrial reuse such as cooling water  boiler water and process water  environmental and recreational uses such as the creation or restoration of wetlands  as well as agricultural irrigation  112  In some cases  such as in Irvine Ranch Water District in Orange County it is also used for flushing toilets  113  It was estimated that in 2002 a total of 1 7 billion US gallons  6 400 000 m3  per day  or almost 3  of public water supply  were being directly reused  California reused 0 6 and Florida 0 5 billion US gallons  1 900 000 m3  per day respectively  Twenty five states had regulations regarding the use of reclaimed water in 2002  112  Planned direct reuse of reclaimed water was initiated in 1932 with the construction of a reclaimed water facility at San Francisco s Golden Gate Park  Reclaimed water is typically distributed with a color coded dual piping network that keeps reclaimed water pipes completely separate from potable water pipes  114   edit  Pollution control Numerous efforts have been undertaken in the United States to control the pollution of water resources and to make drinking water safe  The most comprehensive federal regulations and standards for the water treatment industry were implemented in the 1970s  in reaction to a huge increase in environmental concerns in the country  In 1972  Congress passed the Clean Water Act  with the unprecedented goal of eliminating all water pollution by 1985 and authorized expenditures of  24 6 billion in research and construction grants  115  In 1974  Congress passed the Safe Drinking Water Act  specifying a number of contaminants that had to be closely monitored and reported to residents should they exceed the maximum contaminant levels  116  Both Acts were complemented by substantial federal grant funding to improve infrastructure in the form of construction grants  In 1987 Congress  through the Water Quality Act  passed an amendment of the Clean Water Act  abolishing construction grants and replacing them by a system of subsidized loans using the Clean Water State Revolving Fund  The intention at the time was to completely phase out federal funding after a few years  Funding for the CWSRF peaked in 1991 and continued at high levels thereafter  despite the original intentions  117  New challenges arose  such as the need to address combined sewer overflows for which EPA issued a policy in 1994  In 1997 Congress established the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund  in order to finance investments to improve compliance with more stringent drinking water quality standards  Today cities make significant investments in the control of combined sewer overflows  including through the construction of storage facilities in the sewerage system in order to allow for the subsequent controlled release of sewage into treatment plants   edit  Federal assistance The United States Congress approves federal funding for water and sanitation  including through State Revolving Funds  One way to address the funding needs of utilities to respond to the various challenges they face without increasing the burden of water bills on users is federal financial assistance  Centralized water and sanitation infrastructure is typically financed through utilities  own revenue or debt  Debt can be in the form of soft loans from State Revolving Funds  SRF   credits from commercial Banks or   in the case of large utilities   from bonds issued directly in the capital market  In the case of water supply  i e  excluding sanitation   42  of investments were financed by private sector borrowing  39  by current revenues  13  by government loans including the Drinking Water SRF  5  by government grants and 1  from other sources  5  Although federal funding for the main of the two SRFs has declined in real terms by 70  between its peak in 1991 and 2006  SRFs play an important role in financing water and sanitation investments  117  118  119  There are two SRFs  The larger Clean Water State Revolving Fund  created in 1987  120  121  122  and the smaller Drinking Water State Revolving Fund  created in 1997  26  They receive federal and state contributions and issue bonds  In turn  they provide soft loans to utilities in their respective states  with average interest rates at 2  for up to 20 years in the case of the Clean Water State Revolving Fund  In addition to the SRFs  the United States Department of Agriculture provides grants  loans and loan guarantees for water supply and sanitation in small communities  those with less than 10 000 inhabitants   together with technical assistance and training  123  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of February 17  2009  provides  4 billion for the Clean Water SRF   2 billion for the Drinking Water SRF and  among others   126 million for water recycling projects through the United States Bureau of Reclamation  124  This exceeds previous levels of financing  since Congress approved only US 1 5 billion of federal funding for State Revolving Funds in 2008  This was much below the historical average of US 3 billion year for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund  1987 2006  121  125  and US  1 2 billion year for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund  1997 2005   26  The share of federal funding for sanitation has declined from almost 50  in the early 1980s to about 20  in the early 1990s  126   edit  See also Bottled water in the United States Environment of the United States  edit  References
