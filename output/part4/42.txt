Moulded into a professional act by manager Brian Epstein  their musical potential was enhanced by the creativity of producer George Martin  They gained popularity in the United Kingdom after their

international stars  leading the  British Invasion  of the United States pop market  The band toured extensively around the world until August 1966  when they performed their final commercial concert

Formation  Hamburg  and UK popularity  1957 1962  In March 1957 John Lennon  then aged sixteen  formed a skiffle group with several friends from Quarry Bank school  They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks  before changing their name to The Quarrymen after discovering that a respected local group was already using the name  3  Fifteen year old Paul McCartney joined as a guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that July  4  In February 1958 McCartney invited his friend George Harrison to watch the group  The fourteen year old auditioned for Lennon on the upperdeck of a bus  playing  Raunchy  by Bill Justis  While Lennon was initially impressed by his playing ability  he thought Harrison was too young for the band  but after about a month of persistence he joined as lead guitarist  5  6  By January 1959  Lennon s schoolfriends had left the group  and he had begun studies at the Liverpool College of Art  7  The three guitarists  billing themselves at least three times as  Johnny and the Moondogs   8  were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer  9  Lennon s art school friend Stu Sutcliffe  who had recently sold one of his paintings and purchased a bass guitar using the proceeds  joined in January 1960  and it was he who suggested changing the band s name to  The Beetles  as a tribute to Buddy Holly and The Crickets  10  According to Beatles expert Mark Lewishon  they used the name  Beatals   through May  when they became  The Silver Beetles   before undertaking a brief tour of Scotland as the backing group for pop singer and fellow Liverpudlian Johnny Gentle  By early July they had changed their name to  The Silver Beatles   and by the middle of August to  The Beatles   11  The lack of a full time drummer posed a problem when the group s unofficial manager  Allan Williams  arranged a resident band booking for them in Hamburg  Germany  but before the middle of August they auditioned and hired Pete Best  and the five piece band left four days later  contracted to club owner Bruno Koschmider  for what would be a 3  month residency  12  Lewisohn writes   They pulled into Hamburg at dusk on 17 August  the time when the red light area comes to life     flashing neon lights screamed out the various entertainment on offer  while scantily clad women sat unabashed in shop windows waiting for business opportunities   13  Initially placing the group at the Indra Club  in October Koschmider moved them to the Kaiserkeller  after he closed the Indra due to noise complaints  14  When he learned they were also performing at The Top Ten Club  a rival venue and thus in breach of contract  Koschmider gave the band one month s termination notice  15  and reported the underage Harrison  16  who had obtained permission to stay in Hamburg by lying to the German authorities about his age  causing his deportation in late November  17  A week later  Koschmider had McCartney and Best arrested for arson after they set fire to a tapestry on the wall in their room  they were also deported  18  Lennon returned to Liverpool in early December  while the newly engaged Sutcliffe remained in Hamburg with his German fianc e  Astrid Kirchherr  through late February  19  Kirchherr took the first semi professional photos of the group  20  and she encouraged Sutcliffe to comb his hair forward in the pilzenkopf or  mushroom head  style popular among university students in Germany and France at the time  21  In 1961  during their second Hamburg engagement  she cut his hair 22  in the  exi   or existentialist style that was later adopted by the other Beatles  23  When he decided to leave the band in early 1961 and resume his art studies in Germany  McCartney took up the bass  24  German producer Bert Kaempfert contracted what was now a four piece group through June 1962  and he used them as Tony Sheridan s backing band on a series of recordings  25  Credited to  Tony Sheridan  amp  The Beat Brothers   the single  My Bonnie   recorded in June and released four months later  reached number 32 on the Musikmarkt chart  and was group s first worldwide release  26  After completing their second Hamburg stint the group enjoyed increasing popularity back home in Liverpool  particularly in Merseyside  where the Merseybeat movement was gaining popularity  However  the band were also growing tired of the monotony of numerous appearances at the same clubs night after night  27  In November  during one of the band s frequent appearances at the Cavern Club  they encountered Brian Epstein  a local record store owner and music columnist  28  Epstein would later recall   I immediatley liked what I heard  They were fresh and they were honest  and they had what I thought was a sort of presence and     star quality   29  Epstein courted the band over the next couple of months and was appointed manager in January 1962  30  He made efforts throughout the winter and spring to get them released from their contract obligations with Bert Kaempfert Productions  31  To secure an early release from the contract  Epstein negotiated for the band to provide one last recording session  at the end of May  during their next visit to Hamburg  31  Tragedy greeted them upon their return there in April  when a distraught Kirchherr met them at the airport with news of Sutcliffe s death the previous day from a brain haemorrhage  32  Kaempfert released them from the record contract the day after the session  a month before it was to expire at the end of June  31  and although Decca Records rejected the band in early February with the comment   Guitar groups are on the way out  Mr  Epstein   33 George Martin signed the group to EMI s Parlophone label in May  32  Abbey Road Studios main entrance The Beatles first recording session under Martin s direction took place at EMI s Abbey Road Studios in London in June 1962  Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best s drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in the studio  34  The band had already been contemplating Best s dismissal  so he was replaced by Ringo Starr  who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them  but had previously performed with them during Best s occasional absences  35  A dissatisfied Martin hired session drummer Andy White   36  who played on the band s first single   Love Me Do  and  P S  I Love You   37  Released in early October   Love Me Do  was a top twenty UK hit  peaking at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart  38  In mid October they made their television d but with a live performance on the regional news programme People and Places  39  and a late November studio session yielded their second single   Please Please Me   40  after which Martin accurately predicted   You ve just made your first No 1   41  In December 1962  the band concluded their fifth and final Hamburg stint  42  By 1963 Epstein  Martin  and the group had agreed that all four members should contribute vocals to their albums  despite Starr s restricted vocal range  to  affirm his status as a full fledged member   43  Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership  and as the band s success grew  their dominant collaboration limited Harrison s opportunities as a lead vocalist  44  Epstein  wanting to maximize their commercial potential  encouraged the group to adopt a professional attitude to performing  45  Lennon recalled him saying   Look  if you really want to get in these bigger places  you re going to have to change   stop eating on stage  stop swearing  stop smoking   46  Lennon said   We used to dress how we liked  on and off stage  He d tell us that jeans were not particularly smart and could we possibly manage to wear proper trousers  but he didn t want us suddenly looking square  He d let us have our own sense of individuality   46  Beatlemania and touring years  1963 1966  Please Please Me and With The Beatles After the moderate success of  Love Me Do    Please Please Me  met with a more emphatic reception  Released in January 1963  it reached number one on every national chart except Record Retailer  where it stalled at number two  47  Martin originally considered recording The Beatles  debut LP live at the Cavern Club  but after deciding that the building s acoustics were inadequate he elected to simulate a  live  album with minimal production in  a single marathon session at Abbey Road   48  Ten songs were recorded for Please Please Me  accompanied by the four tracks already released on their two singles  48  Recalling how the band  rushed to deliver a debut album  bashing out Please Please Me in a day   Allmusic s Stephen Thomas Erlewine comments   Decades after its release  the album still sounds fresh  precisely because of its intense origins   49  Lennon said little thought went into composition at the time  he and McCartney were  just writing songs   la Everly Brothers    la Buddy Holly  pop songs with no more thought of them than that to create a sound  And the words were almost irrelevant   50   The Beatles  logo painted on Starr s drum Released in March 1963  the album reached number one on the top four British charts  initiating a run during which eleven of their twelve studio albums released in the United Kingdom through 1970 reached number one  51  The band s third single   From Me to You   came out in April and was also a chart topping hit  starting an almost unbroken run of seventeen British number one singles for the band  including all but one of the eighteen they released over the next six years  52  On its release in August  the band s fourth single   She Loves You   achieved the fastest sales of any record in the UK up to that time  selling three quarters of a million copies in under four weeks  53  It became their first single to sell a million copies  and remained the biggest selling record in the UK until 1978 when it was surpassed by  Mull of Kintyre   by McCartney s post Beatles band  Wings  54  The popularity of their music brought with it increasing press attention  to which the band members responded with an irreverent and comical attitude that defied what was expected of pop musicians at the time  inspiring even more interest  55  McCartney  Harrison  Swedish pop singer Lill Babs and Lennon on the set of the Swedish television show Drop In  30 October 1963 56  The Beatles  logo  seen on the front of Starr s bass drum during the group s major touring years  57  was based on an impromptu sketch by instrument retailer and designer Ivor Arbiter upon instruction from Epstein that the design should emphasize the word  beat   58  59  The band toured the UK three times in the first half of the year  a four week tour that began in February preceded three week tours in March and May June  As their popularity spread  a frenzied adulation of the group took hold  dubbed  Beatlemania   Although not billed as tour leaders  they overshadowed other acts including Tommy Roe  Chris Montez and Roy Orbison  American artists who had established great popularity in the UK  60  Performances everywhere  both on tour and at many one off shows around the country  were greeted with riotous enthusiasm by screaming fans  61  In late October  a five day tour of Sweden saw the band venture abroad for the first time since the Hamburg chapter  62  Returning to the UK  they were greeted at Heathrow Airport in heavy rain by thousands of fans in  a scene similar to a shark feeding frenzy   attended by fifty journalists and photographers and a BBC Television camera crew  63  The next day  they began yet another British tour  scheduled for six weeks  By now  they were indisputably the headliners  60  Before a concert in Plymouth  police found it necessary to use high pressure water hoses to control the crowds  and there were debates in Parliament concerning the thousands of police officers putting themselves at risk to protect the group  64  65  Please Please Me maintained the top position on the Record Retailer chart for thirty weeks  only to be displaced by their follow up  With The Beatles  which EMI delayed the release of until sales of Please Please Me had subsided  66 With The Beatles was released in late November to record advance orders of 270 000 copies  topping the half million mark in one week  67  It held the top spot for twenty one weeks with a chart life of 40 weeks  68  Making much greater use of studio production techniques than its  deliberately primitive  predecessor  the album was recorded between July and October  69  Erlewine describes With The Beatles as  a sequel of the highest order one that betters the original by developing its own tone and adding depth   70  In a reversal of what had until then been standard practice  the album was released in late November ahead of the impending single  I Want to Hold Your Hand   with the song excluded in order to maximize the single s sales  71 With The Beatles caught the attention of The Times  music critic William Mann  who went as far as to suggest that Lennon and McCartney were  the outstanding English composers of 1963   69  The newspaper published a series of articles in which Mann offered detailed analyses of the music  lending it respectability  72 With The Beatles became the second album in UK chart history to sell a million copies  a figure previously reached only by the 1958 South Pacific soundtrack  73  In writing the sleeve notes for the album  the band s press officer Tony Barrow used the superlative  the fabulous foursome   which the media would widely adopt as   the Fab Four   74   British Invasion   I Want to Hold Your Hand  Sample of the single  I Want to Hold Your Hand   1963  which secured the band s international success when it achieved enormous US popularity a few weeks before their debut in the country Problems listening to this file  See media help  The Beatles  releases in the United States were hindered for over a year by EMI s American subsidiary  Capitol Records  who initially declined to issue Beatles material  including their first three singles  Concurrent negotiations with the independent US labels Vee Jay and Swan led to the eventual release of the singles  but legal issues with royalties and publishing rights proved an obstacle to the successful marketing of the group in the US  75  Capitol began to issue the material in December 1963  76  exercising complete control over format  they compiled distinct US albums from the band s recordings and issued songs of their choosing as singles  77  American chart success began after Epstein arranged for a  40 000 US marketing campaign and secured the support of disk jockey Carrol James  who first played the band s records in mid December 1963  initiating their music s spread across US radio  This caused an increase in demand  leading Capitol to rush release  I Want to Hold Your Hand  later that month  78  Released 26 December 1963   I Want to Hold Your Hand  sold a million copies in the US by 10 January 1964  and by 16 January the single was a number one hit in the States  with the band s previously scheduled debut there just weeks away  79  The Beatles arrive at John F  Kennedy International Airport  7 February 1964 The Beatles left the United Kingdom on 7 February 1964  with an estimated four thousand fans gathered at Heathrow  waving and screaming as the aircraft took off  80  At New York s John F  Kennedy Airport they were greeted by another uproarious crowd estimated at three thousand people  81  They gave their first live US television performance two days later on The Ed Sullivan Show  watched by approximately 73 million viewers in over 23 million households  82 or 34 percent of the American population  and according to the Nielsen rating service  it was  the largest audience that had ever been recorded for an American television program   83  The next morning critical consensus in the US was generally against the group  84  but a day later their first US concert saw Beatlemania erupt at Washington Coliseum  85  Back in New York the following day  they met with another strong reception during their two shows at Carnegie Hall  82  The band then flew to Florida and appeared on the weekly Ed Sullivan Show a second time  before another 70 million viewers  before returning to the UK on 22 February  86  A Hard Day s Night Capitol Records  lack of interest throughout 1963 had not gone unnoticed  A competitor  United Artists Records  encouraged their film division to offer the group a three motion picture deal  primarily for the commercial potential of the soundtracks  87  Directed by Richard Lester  A Hard Day s Night had the group s involvement for six weeks in March April 1964 as they played themselves in a mock documentary  88  The film premiered in London and New York in July and August  respectively  and was an international success  with some critics drawing comparison with the Marx Brothers  89  According to Erlewine  the accompanying soundtrack album  A Hard Day s Night  saw them  truly coming into their own as a band  All of the disparate influences on their first two albums had coalesced into a bright  joyous  original sound  filled with ringing guitars and irresistible melodies   90  That  ringing guitar  sound was primarily the product of Harrison s 12 string electric Rickenbacker  a prototype given him by the manufacturer  which made its debut on the record  Harrison s ringing 12 string inspired Roger McGuinn  who obtained his own Rickenbacker and used it to craft the trademark sound of The Byrds  91  The Beatles held twelve positions on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart during the week of 4 April  including the top five  92  That same week  a third American LP joined the two already in circulation  two of the three reached the first spot on the Billboard album chart  the third peaked at number two  93  The band s popularity generated unprecedented interest in British music  and a number of other UK acts subsequently made their own American debuts  successfully touring over the next three years in what was termed the British Invasion  94  The Beatles  hairstyle  unusually long for the era and mocked by many adults  was widely adopted and became an emblem of rebellion to the burgeoning youth culture  95  McCartney  Harrison and Lennon perform on Dutch television in 1964 The Beatles toured internationally in June and July  Staging thirty seven shows over twenty seven days in Denmark  the Netherlands  Hong Kong  Australia and New Zealand  96  Starr was briefly hospitalised after a tonsillectomy  and Jimmie Nicol sat in on drums for the first five dates  97  In August they returned to the US  with a thirty concert tour of twenty three cities  98  Generating intense interest once again  the month long tour attracted between ten and twenty thousand fans to each thirty minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York  98  In August  journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the group to meet Bob Dylan  99  Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite  Dylan introduced them to cannabis  100  Beatles biographer Jonathan Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting  before which the musicians  respective fanbases were  perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds   Dylan s core audience of  college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings  a dawning political and social idealism  and a mildly bohemian style  contrasted with The Beatles  core audience of  veritable  teenyboppers  kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialized popular culture of television  radio  pop records  fan magazines  and teen fashion  They were seen as idolaters  not idealists   Within six months of the meeting   Lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated Dylan s nasal drone  brittle strum  and introspective vocal persona   Within a year  Dylan would  proceed  with the help of a five piece group and a Fender Stratocaster electric guitar  to shake the monkey of folk authenticity permanently off his back     the distinctions between the folk and rock audiences would have nearly evaporated  and  The Beatles  audience     would be showing signs of growing up   101  In September they refused to play a show in Florida until the local promoter assured them that the audience would not be racially segregated  102  Beatles for Sale  Help  and Rubber Soul According to Gould  the band s fourth studio LP  Beatles for Sale  indicates an emerging conflict between the  intense commercial pressures  of global success  and the group s  creative aspirations   103  Recorded between August and October 1964  104  they had intended the album to continue the format established by A Hard Day s Night which  unlike the band s first two LPs  contained only original songs  103  However  having nearly exhausted their backlog of songs on the previous album  and the challenges posed by constant international touring to the band s songwriting efforts  Lennon admitted   Material s becoming a hell of a problem   and as such six covers from their extensive repertoire were chosen to complete the album  103  Released in early December  its eight original compositions stood out  demonstrating a growing maturity in the Lennon McCartney songwriting partnership  103  In early 1965  while they were his guests for dinner  Lennon and Harrison s dentist secretly added LSD to their coffee  Lennon described the experience   It was just terrifying  but it was fantastic  I was pretty stunned for a month or two   105  He and Harrison subsequently became regular users of the drug  joined by Starr on at least one occasion  106  McCartney was initially reluctant to try it  but eventually did so in the fall of 1966  106  He later became the first Beatle to discuss LSD publicly  declaring in a magazine interview that  it opened my eyes  and  made me a better  more honest  more tolerant member of society   107  Controversy erupted in June 1965 when Elizabeth II appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire  MBE  after Prime Minister Harold Wilson nominated them for the award  108  In protest the honour was at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders some conservative MBE recipients returned their own insignia  109  The US trailer for Help  with  from the rear  Harrison  McCartney  Lennon and  largely obscured  Starr The Beatles  second film  Help   again directed by Lester  was released in July  Described as  mainly a relentless spoof of Bond   110  it inspired a mixed response among both reviewers and the band  McCartney said   Help  was great but it wasn t our film we were sort of guest stars  It was fun  but basically  as an idea for a film  it was a bit wrong   111  The soundtrack was dominated by Lennon  who wrote and sang lead on most of its songs  including the two singles   Help   and  Ticket to Ride   112  The accompanying album  the group s fifth studio LP  contained all original material save for two covers  including the LP s closing track   Dizzy Miss Lizzy   which became the last cover the band would include on an album  with the exception of Let It Be s brief rendition of the traditional Liverpool folk song  Maggie Mae   113 Help  reflects the band s increased use of vocal overdubs and the incorporation of classical instruments into their arrangements  notably the string quartet on the pop ballad  Yesterday   114  Composed by McCartney   Yesterday  would inspire the most recorded cover versions of any song ever written  115  The band s third US visit  on 15 August  opened with the first major stadium concert in history when they performed before a crowd of 55 600 at New York s Shea Stadium  116  A further nine successful concerts followed in other American cities  Towards the end of the tour they were granted an audience with Elvis Presley  a foundational musical influence on the band  who invited them to his home in Beverly Hills  where they discussed the music business and exchanged anecdotes  117  118  In September  The Beatles  an American Saturday morning cartoon series began that echoed A Hard Day s Night s slapstick antics  Original episodes appeared for the next two years  and reruns aired through 1969  119   Norwegian Wood  This Bird Has Flown   Sample of  Norwegian Wood  This Bird Has Flown   from Rubber Soul  1965   The use of a sitar on this song saw the band  beginning to expand the conventional instrumental parameters of the rock group   120  Problems listening to this file  See media help  Released in December 1965  Rubber Soul has been hailed by critics as a major step forward in the maturity and complexity of the band s music  120  Musicologist Ian MacDonald observes that with the album they  recovered the sense of direction that had begun to elude them during the later stages of work on Beatles for Sale   121  Their thematic reach was beginning to expand as they embraced more complex aspects of romance and philosophy  122  Biographers Peter Brown and Steven Gaines attribute the new musical direction to  the Beatles now habitual use of marijuana   123  an assertion confirmed by the band Lennon referred to it as  the pot album   124  and Starr said   Grass was really influential in a lot of our changes  especially with the writers  And because they were writing different material  we were playing differently   124  After Help  s foray into the world of classical music with flutes and strings  Harrison s introduction of a sitar on  Norwegian Wood  This Bird Has Flown   marked a further progression outside the traditional boundaries of rock music  As their lyrics grew more artful  fans began to study them for deeper meaning  There was speculation that  Norwegian Wood  might refer to cannabis  a claim Lennon refuted   I was trying to be sophisticated in writing about an affair     but in such a smokescreen way that you couldn t tell   125  While many of Rubber Soul s more notable songs were the product of Lennon and McCartney s collaborative songwriting  126  it also featured distinct compositions from each  127  though they continued to share official credit  The song  In My Life   of which each later claimed lead authorship  is considered a highlight of the entire Lennon McCartney catalog  128  Harrison called Rubber Soul his  favorite album  124  and Starr referred to it as  the departure record   129  McCartney said   We d had our cute period  and now it was time to expand   130  However  recording engineer Norman Smith later stated that the studio sessions revealed signs of growing conflict within the group  the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious   he wrote  and  as far as Paul was concerned  George could do no right   131  In 2003  Rolling Stone ranked Rubber Soul fifth among  The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time   132  and Allmusic s Richie Unterberger describes it as  one of the classic folk rock records   1  Controversy  studio years and break up  1966 1970  Events leading up to final tour In June 1966  Yesterday and Today a compilation album created by Capitol Records for the US market caused an uproar over its cover  which portrayed the grinning Beatles dressed in butcher s overalls  accompanied by raw meat and mutilated plastic baby dolls  It has been suggested that this was meant as a satirical response to the way Capitol had  butchered  the US versions of their albums  133  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over the original  an unpeeled  first state  copy fetched  10 500 at a December 2005 auction  134  In England  meanwhile  Harrison met sitar maestro Ravi Shankar  who agreed to train him on the instrument  135  During a tour of the Philippines the month after the Yesterday and Today furore  they unintentionally snubbed the nation s first lady  Imelda Marcos  who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace  136  When presented with the invitation  Epstein politely declined on behalf of the group  as it had never been his policy to accept such official invitations  137  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to taking  no  for an answer  The resulting riots endangered the group and they escaped the country with difficulty  138  Immediately afterward  the band members made their first visit to India  139  Almost as soon as they returned home  they faced a fierce backlash from US religious and social conservatives  as well as the Ku Klux Klan  over a comment Lennon had made in a March interview with British reporter Maureen Cleave  140   Christianity will go   Lennon said   It will vanish and shrink  I needn t argue about that  I m right and I will be proved right  We re more popular than Jesus now  I don t know which will go first  rock  n  roll or Christianity  Jesus was alright but his disciples were thick and ordinary  It s them twisting it that ruins it for me   141  The comment went virtually unnoticed in England  but when US teenage fan magazine Datebook printed it five months later on the eve of the group s final US tour it created a controversy with Christians in the American  Bible Belt   140  Epstein publicly criticised Datebook  saying they had taken Lennon s words out of context  and at a press conference Lennon pointed out   If I d said television was more popular than Jesus  I might have got away with it   142  Lennon claimed he was referring to how other people viewed their success  but when prompted by reporters he concluded by saying   If you want me to apologise  if that will make you happy  then okay  I m sorry   142  The nature of their modest on stage amplification meant their music could hardly be heard  as the group s small Vox amplifiers struggled to compete with the volume of sound generated by screaming fans  and they grew increasingly bored with the routine of performing live  143  Realizing that their shows were no longer about the music  they decided to put an end to concert touring  144  Revolver and Sgt  Pepper s Lonely Hearts Club Band  Eleanor Rigby  Sample of  Eleanor Rigby  from Revolver  1966   The album involves innovative compositional

marked a major step forward  Revolver  released in August 1966 a week before the band s final tour  marked another  145  Lewisohn identifies it as   The vital plateau between their  touring years  and  studio years      the album which     shows the Beatles at the peak of their creativity     a masterpiece born out of a sudden artistic and creative freedom  and the remarkable maturation of  the band    146  Described by Gould as  woven with motifs of circularity  reversal  and inversion   Revolver featured sophisticated songwriting  studio experimentation  and a greatly expanded repertoire of musical styles ranging from innovative classical string arrangements to psychedelic rock  145  Abandoning the customary group photograph  its cover design by Klaus Voormann  was a stark  arty  black and white collage that caricatured the Beatles in a pen and ink style beholden to Aubrey Beardsley   145  The album was preceded by the single  Paperback Writer   backed by  Rain   147  The Beatles made short promotional films for both songs  which Harrison described as  the forerunner of videos   148  They aired on The Ed Sullivan Show and Top of the Pops in June 1966  149  Among Revolver s experimental songs was  Tomorrow Never Knows   for whose lyrics Lennon drew from Timothy Leary s The Psychedelic Experience  A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead  The track s creation involved eight tape decks distributed about the EMI building  each manned by an engineer or a Beatle  who randomly varied the movement of a tape loop while Martin created a composite recording by sampling the incoming data  150  McCartney s  Eleanor Rigby  made prominent use of a string octet  Gould described it as  a true hybrid  conforming to no recognizable style or genre of song   151  Harrison was developing as a songwriter  and three of his compositions earned a place on the record  In 2003  Rolling Stone ranked Revolver as the third greatest album of all time  132  During the US tour that followed its release however  the band performed none of its songs  152  As Chris Ingham explains  they were very much  studio creations     and there was no way a four piece rock  n  roll group could do them justice  particularly through the desensitising wall of the fans  screams   Live Beatles  and  Studio Beatles  had become entirely different beasts   153  The final show  at San Francisco s Candlestick Park on 29 August  was their last commercial concert  154  It marked the end of a four year period dominated by touring that included over 1 400 concert appearances internationally  155   Within You Without You  Sample of  Within You Without You  from Sgt  Pepper s Lonely Hearts Club Band  1967   This raga rock song demonstrates the influence of Indian classical music on the band   Strawberry Fields Forever  Sample of  Strawberry Fields Forever   1967   recorded at the beginning of the Sgt  Pepper sessions  Problems listening to these files  See media help  Freed from the burden of touring  the band embraced an increasingly experimental approach as they recorded Sgt  Pepper s Lonely Hearts Club Band  beginning in late November 1966  156  Recording engineer Geoff Emerick recalls their insistence  that everything on Sgt  Pepper had to be different      w e had microphones right down in the bells of brass instruments and headphones turned into microphones attached to violins      w e used giant primitive oscillators to vary the speed of instruments and vocals and we had tapes chopped to pieces and stuck together upside down and the wrong way around   157  Parts of  A Day in the Life  featured a forty piece orchestra  157  According to Emerick  the album   took more than seven hundred hours to record   158  The sessions initially yielded the non album double A side single  Strawberry Fields Forever   Penny Lane  in February 1967  Sgt  Pepper followed in June  the first major pop rock LP to include its complete lyrics  159  The musical complexity of the record  created using only four track recording technology  astounded contemporary artists  160  and was met with critical acclaim  161  Gould writes  The overwhelming consensus is that the Beatles had created a popular masterpiece  a rich  sustained  and overflowing work of collaborative genius whose bold ambition and startling originality dramatically enlarged the possibilities and raised the expectations of what the experience of listening to popular music on record could be  On the basis of this perception  Sgt  Pepper became the catalyst for an explosion of mass enthusiasm for album formatted rock that would revolutionize both the aesthetics and the economics of the record business   162  Front cover of Sgt  Pepper s Lonely Hearts Club Band    T he most famous cover of any music album  and one of the most imitated images in the world   160  In late 1967 Sgt  Pepper was the subject of a scholarly analysis by American literary critic and professor of English Richard Poirier  who observed that his students were  listening to the group s music with a degree of engagement that he  as a teacher of literature  could only envy   163  Poirier identified what he termed the  mixed allusiveness  of the material   It s unwise ever to assume that they re doing only one thing or expressing themselves in only one style     one kind of feeling about a subject isn t enough     any single induced feeling must often exist within the context of seemingly contradictory alternatives   163  McCartney said at the time   We write songs  We know what we mean by them  But      y ou put your own meaning at your own level to our songs   163 Sgt  Pepper s elaborate album cover also attracted interest and study  164  The heavy moustaches worn by the band reflected the growing influence of hippie style  165  Cultural historian Jonathan Harris describes their  brightly coloured parodies of military uniforms  as a knowingly  anti authoritarian and anti establishment  display  166  In 2003  Rolling Stone ranked it number one on its list of the  500 Greatest Albums of All Time   132  On 25 June the band performed their forthcoming single   All You Need Is Love   to an estimated 350 million viewers during Our World  the first live global television link  167  Released a week later during the Summer of Love  the song was adopted as a flower power anthem  168  Two months later the group suffered a loss that threw their career into turmoil  Having only been introduced to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi the previous night in London  on 25 August they travelled to Bangor for his Transcendental Meditation retreat  Two days later  their manager s assistant Peter Brown phoned to inform them that Epstein had died  169  The coroner ruled the death an accidental carbitol overdose  though publicly it was widely rumoured a suicide  170  He had been in a fragile emotional state  stressed by personal issues and his working relationship with the band  worried they might not renew his management contract  due to expire in October  based on discontent with his supervision of business matters  particularly the Seltaeb fiasco  171  His death left the group disorientated and fearful about the future  Lennon recalled   We collapsed  I knew that we were in trouble then  I didn t really have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music and I was scared  I thought  we ve had it now   172  Magical Mystery Tour  White Album and Yellow Submarine The soundtrack to a Beatles television film  Magical Mystery Tour was released in the UK as a six track double extended play disc  EP  in early December 1967  173  76  In the United States  the six songs were issued on an identically titled LP that also included five tracks from the band s recent singles  93  Unterberger says of the US Magical Mystery Tour   The psychedelic sound is very much in the vein of Sgt  Pepper  and even spacier in parts  especially the sound collages of  I Am the Walrus     and calls its five songs culled from the band s 1967 singles  huge  glorious  and innovative   174  In its first three weeks  it set a record for the highest initial sales of any Capitol LP  and is the only Capitol compilation later to be adopted in the band s official canon of studio albums  175  First aired on Boxing Day  the Magical Mystery Tour film brought the group their first major negative UK press  It was dismissed as  blatant rubbish  by the Daily Express  and The Daily Mail called it  a colossal conceit   while The Guardian labelled it  a kind of fantasy morality play about the grossness and warmth and stupidity of the audience   176  Gould decribes it as   a great deal of raw footage showing a group of people getting on  getting off  and riding on a bus   176  Although TV viewership was respectable  broad critical consensus in the UK caused US television networks to lose interest in broadcasting it  177  In January the group filmed a cameo for the animated movie Yellow Submarine  which featured a cartoon version of the band and a soundtrack with eleven of group s songs  including four unreleased studio recordings which made their debut in the film  178  Released in June 1968  it was well received by critics for its humour  music  and innovative visual style  179  A soundtrack album followed seven months later  76  McCartney  Starr  Harrison and Lennon in the trailer for Yellow Submarine  Their cameo was filmed 25 January 1968  three weeks before they left for India  180  In the interim came The Beatles  a double LP popularly known as the White Album for its virtually featureless cover  Creative inspiration for the album came from a new direction when  with Epstein s guiding presence gone  the group turned to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi as their guru  181  At his ashram in Rishikesh  India  a three month  Guide Course  became one of their most creative periods  yielding a large number of songs including most of the thirty recorded for the album  182  Starr left after ten days  likening it to Butlins  and McCartney eventually grew bored with the procedure and departed a month later  183  For Lennon and Harrison  creativity turned to questioning when Yanni Alexis Mardas  the electronics technician dubbed Magic Alex  suggested that the Maharishi was attempting to manipulate the group  181  After Mardas alleged that the Maharishi had made sexual advances to women attendees  Lennon was persuaded and left abruptly  taking the unconvinced Harrison and the remainder of the group s entourage with him  183  In his anger Lennon wrote a pointed song called  Maharishi   which he later modified to avoid a legal suit  resulting in  Sexy Sadie   181  McCartney said   We made a mistake  We thought there was more to him than there was   181   While My Guitar Gently Weeps  Sample of  While My Guitar Gently Weeps  from The Beatles  1968   A rock ballad among songs of a variety of other genres on the album   Helter Skelter  Sample of  Helter Skelter  from The Beatles  1968   The album s music ranges from the musique concr te composition  Revolution 9  to the  proto metal roar  of this song  Problems listening to these files  See media help  During recording sessions for the album  which stretched from late May to mid October 1968  relations among the band s members grew openly divisive  Starr quit for a period  leaving McCartney to play drums on at least two tracks   Back in the U S S R   and  Dear Prudence   184  Lennon s romantic preoccupation with avant garde artist Yoko Ono contributed to tension within the band and he lost interest in co writing with McCartney  185  Flouting the group s well established understanding that they would not allow their partners in the studio  Lennon insisted on bringing Ono to all of the sessions  186  Increasingly contemptuous of McCartney s creative input  he began to identify the latter s compositions as  granny music   dismissing  Ob La Di  Ob La Da  as  granny shit   187  Recalling the White Album sessions  Lennon gave a curiously foreshortened summing up of the band s history from that point on  saying   It s like if you took each track off it and made it all mine and all Paul s    just me and a backing group  Paul and a backing group  and I enjoyed it  We broke up then   188  McCartney also recalled that the sessions marked the start of the break up  saying   Up to that point  the world was a problem  but we weren t   189  Issued in November  the White Album was the band s first Apple Records album release  The new label was a subsidiary of Apple Corps  formed by the group on their return from India  fulfilling a plan of Epstein s to create a tax effective business structure  190  The record attracted more than two million advance orders  selling nearly four million copies in the US in little over a month  and its tracks dominated the playlists of American radio stations  191  Despite its popularity  it did not receive flattering reviews at the time  According to Jonathan Gould  The Beatles  known as the White Album for its radically minimalist cover  Conceived by pop artist Richard Hamilton  it has been interpreted as suggesting both a  clean slate  192  and an ironic relationship with the avant garde  193  The critical response     ranged from mixed to flat  In marked contrast to Sgt  Pepper  which had helped to establish an entire genre of literate rock criticism  the White Album inspired no critical writing of any note  Even the most sympathetic reviewers     clearly didn t know what to make of this shapeless outpouring of songs  Newsweek s Hubert Saal  citing the high proportion of parodies  accused the group of getting their tongues caught in their cheeks  191  General critical opinion eventually turned in favour of the White Album  and in 2003 Rolling Stone ranked it as the tenth greatest album of all time  132  Pitchfork s Mark Richardson describes it as  large and sprawling  overflowing with ideas but also with indulgences  and filled with a hugely variable array of material     its failings are as essential to its character as its triumphs   194  Erlewine comments   The Beatles  two main songwriting forces were no longer on the same page  but neither were George and Ringo   yet  Lennon turns in two of his best ballads   McCartney s songs are  stunning   Harrison had become  a songwriter who deserved wider exposure  and Starr s composition is  a delight   195  By now the interest in their lyrics was taking a serious turn  When Lennon s song  Revolution  had been released as a single in August ahead of the White Album  its messages seemed clear   free your mind   and  count me out  of any talk about destruction as a means to an end  196  In a year characterized by student protests that stretched from Warsaw to Paris to Chicago  the response from the radical left was scathing  197  However  the White Album version of the song   Revolution 1   added an extra word   count me out     in   implying a change of heart since the single s release  The chronology was in fact reversed the ambivalent album version was recorded first but some felt that Lennon was now saying that political violence might indeed be justifiable  198  The Yellow Submarine LP was issued in January 1969  It contained only four previously unreleased songs  along with the title track   All You Need Is Love   and seven instrumental pieces composed by Martin  Because of the paucity of new Beatles music  Allmusic s Unterberger and Bruce Eder suggest the album might be  inessential  but for Harrison s  It s All Too Much    the jewel of the new songs     resplendent in swirling Mellotron  larger than life percussion  and tidal waves of feedback guitar     a virtuoso excursion into otherwise hazy psychedelia   199  Abbey Road  Let It Be and break up Apple Corps building at 3 Savile Row  site of the Let It Be rooftop concert Although Let It Be was The Beatles  final album release  most of it was recorded before Abbey Road  Initially titled Get Back  Let It Be originated from an idea Martin attributes to McCartney  to prepare new material and  perform it before a live audience for the very first time on record and on film  In other words make a live album of new material  which no one had ever done before   200  In the event  much of the album s content came from studio work  many hours of which were captured on film by director Michael Lindsay Hogg  Martin said that rehearsals and recording for the project  which occupied much of January 1969  were  not at all a happy     experience  It was a time when relations between The Beatles were at their lowest ebb   200  Aggravated by both McCartney and Lennon  Harrison walked out for a week  He returned with keyboardist Billy Preston  who participated in the last ten days of sessions and was credited on the  Get Back  single the only other musician to receive such acknowledgment on an official Beatles recording  The band members had reached an impasse on a concert location  rejecting among several concepts a boat at sea  the Tunisian desert and the Colosseum  Ultimately  their final live performance  accompanied by Preston  was filmed on the rooftop of the Apple Corps building at 3 Savile Row  London  on 30 January 1969  200  Engineer Glyn Johns worked for months assembling various iterations of a Get Back album  while the band turned to other concerns  Conflict arose regarding the appointment of a financial adviser  the need for which had become evident without Epstein to manage business affairs  Lennon  Harrison and Starr favoured Allen Klein  who had negotiated contracts for The Rolling Stones and other UK bands during the British Invasion  McCartney wanted John Eastman  brother of Linda Eastman  whom McCartney married on 12 March  eight days before Lennon and Ono wed   201  Agreement could not be reached  so both were appointed  but further conflict ensued and financial opportunities were lost  201  Martin was surprised when McCartney contacted him and asked him to produce another album  as the Get Back sessions had been  a miserable experience  and he had  thought it was the end of the road for all of us     they were becoming unpleasant people to themselves as well as to other people   202  Recording sessions for Abbey Road began in late February  Lennon rejected Martin s proposed format of a  continuously moving piece of music   and wanted his own and McCartney s songs to occupy separate sides of the album  202  The eventual format  with individually composed songs on the first side and the second consisting largely of a medley  was McCartney s suggested compromise  202  On 4 July  while work on the album was in progress  the first solo single by a Beatles member was released  Lennon s  Give Peace a Chance   credited to the Plastic Ono Band  The completion and mixing of  I Want You  She s So Heavy   on 20 August 1969 was the last occasion on which   All four Beatles     were together inside the recording studio from where they had changed the face of popular music   203  Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September  but agreed to withhold a public announcement biographers differ on whether the decision to keep silent was made to avoid undermining sales of the forthcoming album  204  or Klein s contract negotiations with EMI  205   I Want You  She s So Heavy   Sample of  I Want You  She s So Heavy   from Abbey Road  1969   The completion and mixing of this song on 20 August 1969 marked the last time all four Beatles were together in the studio  Problems listening to this file  See media help  Released six days after Lennon s declaration  Abbey Road sold four million copies within two months and topped the UK chart for eleven weeks  206  Its second track  the ballad  Something   was also issued as a single the first and only song by Harrison to appear as a Beatles A side  207 Abbey Road received mixed reviews  although the medley met with general acclaim  208  Unterberger considers it  a fitting swan song for the group  containing  some of the greatest harmonies to be heard on any rock record   209  MacDonald calls it  erratic and often hollow    Had it not been for McCartney s input as designer of the Long Medley     Abbey Road would lack the semblance of unity and coherence that makes it appear better than it is   210  Martin singled it out as his personal favourite of all the band s albums  Lennon said it was  competent  but had  no life in it   211  calling  Maxwell s Silver Hammer   more of Paul s granny music   212  Recording engineer Emerick noted that the replacement of the studio s valve mixing console with a transistorized one yielded a less punchy sound  leaving the group frustrated at the thinner tone and lack of impact and contributing to its  kinder  gentler  feel relative to their previous albums  213  For the still uncompleted Get Back album  the final song  Harrison s  I Me Mine   was recorded on 3 January 1970  Lennon  in Denmark at the time  did not participate  214  To complete the album  now retitled Let It Be  Klein gave the session tapes to American producer Phil Spector in March  Known for his Wall of Sound approach  Spector had recently produced Lennon s solo single  Instant Karma   In addition to remixing the Get Back material  Spector edited  spliced and overdubbed several of the recordings that had been intended as  live   McCartney was unhappy with Spector s treatment of the material and particularly dissatisfied with the producer s orchestration of  The Long and Winding Road   which involved a choir and thirty four piece instrumental ensemble  He unsuccessfully attempted to halt the release of Spector s version  215  McCartney publicly announced his departure from the band on 10 April  a week before the release of his first  self titled solo album  Pre release copies of McCartney s record included a press statement with a self written interview  explaining the end of the Lennon McCartney songwriting partnership and his hopes for the future  216  On 8 May  the Spector produced Let It Be was released  The accompanying single   The Long and Winding Road   was the band s last  it was released in the United States  but not Britain  The Let It Be documentary film followed later in the month  at the Academy Award ceremony the next year  it would win the Academy Award for Best Original Score  217 The Sunday Telegraph called it  a very bad film and a touching one     about the breaking apart of this reassuring  geometrically perfect  once apparently ageless family of siblings   218  More than one reviewer commented that some of the Let It Be tracks sounded better in the film than on the album  218  Observing that Let It Be is the  only Beatles album to occasion negative  even hostile reviews   Unterberger describes it as  on the whole underrated      McCartney in particular offers several gems  the gospel ish  Let It Be   which has some of his best lyrics   Get Back   one of his hardest rockers  and the melodic  The Long and Winding Road   ruined by Spector s heavy handed overdubs   219  McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution of their contractual partnership on 31 December 1970  220  Legal disputes continued long after the band s break up  and the dissolution of the partnership did not take effect until 9 January 1975  221  222  After the break up  1970 present  See also  Collaborations between ex Beatles

compilation albums without input from the band members  starting with the double disc compilation Rock  n  Roll Music  which features remixes by George Martin  The only one to feature previously unreleased material was The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  1977   The first officially issued concert recordings by the group  it contained selections from two shows they played during their 1964 and 1965 US tours  After the international release of the original British albums on CD in 1987  EMI deleted this latter group of compilations including the Hollywood Bowl record from its catalogue  227  The Beatles  music and enduring fame were commercially exploited in various other ways  outside the band members  creative control  In 1974  the musical John  Paul  George  Ringo    amp  Bert  written

a song about the Beatlemania era  The Beatles  studio albums were released on CD by EMI and Apple Corps in 1987  With their release  the band s catalogue was standardized throughout the world

double EP in the UK  236  All the remaining material from the singles and EPs which had not been issued on the original studio albums was gathered on the two volume compilation Past Masters  1988

Unfortunately  they haven t been  so I would feel like a complete hypocrite waving and smiling with them at a fake reunion   239  The following year  EMI Capitol settled a decade long lawsuit filed by the band over royalties  clearing the way to commercially package previously unreleased material  240  241  1990s Live at the BBC  the first official release of previously unissued Beatles

Aspinall  Their former road manager and personal assistant  Aspinall had started then to gather material for a documentary  originally called The Long and Winding Road  242  243  Documenting their history in the band s own words  the Anthology project saw the release of many previously unissued Beatles recordings  McCartney  Harrison and Starr also added new instrumental and vocal parts to two demo songs recorded by Lennon in the late 1970s  244  During 1995 and 1996 the project yielded a five part television series  an eight volume video set and three two CD box sets  The two songs based

was not available through online music services such as iTunes or Napster during the first decade of the 2000s  256  Residual disagreement stemming from Apple Corps  dispute with Apple  Inc   owners and creators of iTunes  over the use of the name  Apple  was partly responsible  although in November 2008  McCartney stated that the main obstacle was that EMI  want something we re not prepared to give them   257  In March 2009  The Guardian reported that  the prospect of an independent  Beatles specific digital music store  had been raised by Harrison s son  Dhani  who said   We re losing money every day      So what do you do  You have to have your own delivery system  or you have to do a good deal with  Apple  Inc  CEO  Steve Jobs       He  says that a download is worth 99 cents  and we disagree   258  On 9 September 2009  the band s entire back catalogue was reissued following an extensive digital remastering process that lasted four years  236  Stereo editions of all twelve original UK studio albums  along with Magical Mystery Tour and the compilation Past Masters  were released on compact disc both individually and as a box set  A second collection  The Beatles in Mono  included all mono titles along with the original 1965 stereo mixes of Help  and Rubber Soul  the 1987 CD issues of these two albums had been remixed by George Martin   259  For a limited time  a brief video documentary about the remastering was included on each stereo CD  260 The Beatles  Rock Band  a music video game in the Rock Band series  was also released on this day  261  In Mojo  Danny Eccleston wrote   Ever since The Beatles first emerged on CD in 1987  there have been complaints about the sound   singling out  Paperback Writer   Rain  as an example of a single which had superior clarity and dynamism on its original 45 RPM vinyl release  Eccleston praised the remastered sound quality  particularly its effects on the group s singing    T he remastered vocals are purer  more natural sounding and give the illusion of sitting slightly higher in the mix   262  In December 2009  The Beatles  catalogue was officially released in FLAC and MP3 format in a limited edition of 30 000 USB flash drives  263  On 16 November 2010  the official canon of thirteen studio albums  Past Masters and the Red and Blue greatest hits albums were made available on iTunes  264  Musical style and development See also  Lennon McCartney In Icons of Rock  An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever  Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz sum up The Beatles  musical evolution  In their initial incarnation as cheerful  wisecracking moptops  the Fab Four revolutionized the sound  style  and attitude of popular music and opened rock and roll s doors to a tidal wave of British rock acts  Their initial impact would have been enough to establish the Beatles as one of their era s most influential cultural forces  but they didn t stop there  Although their initial style was a highly original  irresistibly catchy synthesis of early American rock and roll and R amp B  the Beatles spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock s stylistic frontiers  consistently staking out new musical territory on each release  The band s increasingly sophisticated experimentation encompassed a variety of genres  including folk rock  country  psychedelia  and baroque pop  without sacrificing the effortless mass appeal of their early work  265  In The Beatles as Musicians  Walter Everett points out Lennon and McCartney s contrasting motivations and approaches to composition   McCartney may be said to have constantly developed as a means to entertain a focused musical talent with an ear for counterpoint and other aspects of craft in the demonstration of a universally agreed upon common language that he did much to enrich  Conversely  Lennon s mature music is best appreciated as the daring product of a largely unconscious  searching but undisciplined artistic sensibility   266  Ian MacDonald  comparing the two composers in Revolution in the Head  describes McCartney as  a natural melodist a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony   His melody lines are characterized as primarily  vertical   employing wide  consonant intervals which express his  extrovert energy and optimism   Conversely  Lennon s  sedentary  ironic personality  is reflected in a  horizontal  approach featuring minimal  dissonant intervals and repetitive melodies which rely on their harmonic accompaniment for interest   Basically a realist  he instinctively kept his melodies close to the rhythms and cadences of speech  colouring his lyrics with bluesy tone and harmony rather than creating tunes that made striking shapes of their own   267  MacDonald praises Harrison s lead guitar work for the role his  characterful lines and textural colourings  play in supporting Lennon and McCartney s parts  and describes Starr as  the father of modern pop rock drumming      His faintly behind the beat style subtly propelled The Beatles  his tunings brought the bottom end into recorded drum sound  and his distinctly eccentric fills remain among the most memorable in pop music   268  Influences The Beatles  earliest influences include Elvis Presley  Carl Perkins  Little Richard and Chuck Berry  269  During their co residency with Little Richard at the Star Club in Hamburg  from April to May 1962  he advised them on the proper technique for performing his songs  270  Of Presley  Lennon said   Nothing really affected me until I heard Elvis  If there hadn t been Elvis  there would not have been The Beatles   271  Other early influences include Buddy Holly  Eddie Cochran  Roy Orbison 272  and the Everly Brothers  273  The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success  often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries  including Bob Dylan  Frank Zappa  The Lovin  Spoonful  The Byrds and The Beach Boys  whose 1966 album Pet Sounds amazed and inspired McCartney  274  275  276  Martin stated   Without Pet Sounds  Sgt  Pepper wouldn t have happened     Pepper was an attempt to equal Pet Sounds   277 Ravi Shankar  with whom Harrison studied for six weeks in India in late 1966  had a significant effect on his musical development during the band s later years  278  Genres A H fner  violin  bass guitar and Gretsch Country Gentleman guitar  models played by McCartney and Harrison  respectively   The bass is right handed  McCartney played a left handed version   The Vox AC30 amplifier behind them is the kind the band used in concert  Originating as a skiffle group  279  The Beatles soon embraced 1950s rock and roll  280  and their repertoire ultimately expanded to include a broad variety of pop music  Reflecting the range of styles they explored  Lennon said of Beatles for Sale   You could call our new one a Beatles country and western LP   281  while Jonathan Gould credits Rubber Soul as  the instrument by which legions of folk music enthusiasts were coaxed into the camp of pop   282  Beginning with the use of a string quartet on Help  s  Yesterday   they also incorporated classical music elements in their recordings  As Gould points out  however  it was not  even remotely the first pop record to make prominent use of strings although it was the first Beatles record to do so     it was rather that the more traditional sound of strings allowed for a fresh appreciation of their talent as composers by listeners who were otherwise allergic to the din of drums and electric guitars   283  The band went on to employ string arrangements to various effect  Of Sgt  Pepper s  She s Leaving Home   for instance  Gould writes that it  is cast in the mold of a sentimental Victorian ballad  its words and music filled with the clich s of musical melodrama   284  The band s stylistic range expanded in another direction in 1966 with the B side to the  Paperback Writer  single   Rain   described by Martin Strong in The Great Rock Discography as  the first overtly psychedelic Beatles record   285  Other psychedelic numbers followed  such as  Tomorrow Never Knows   actually recorded before  Rain     Strawberry Fields Forever    Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds  and  I Am the Walrus   The influence of Indian classical music was evident in songs such as Harrison s  Love You To  and  Within You Without You   whose intent  wrote Gould  was  to replicate the raga form in miniature   286  Summing up the band s musical evolution  music historian and pianist Michael Campbell identifies innovation as its most striking feature  He wrote    A Day in the Life  encapsulates the art and achievement of The Beatles as well as any single track can  It highlights key features of their music  the sound imagination  the persistence of tuneful melody  and the close coordination between words and music  It represents a new category of song more sophisticated than pop     and uniquely innovative  There literally had never before been a song classical or vernacular that had blended so many disparate elements so imaginatively   287  Philosophy professor Bruce Ellis Benson agrees   Composers may be able to conceive new rhythms and chord progressions  but these are usually improvisations upon current rhythms and chord progressions  The Beatles     give us a wonderful example of how such far ranging influences as Celtic music  rhythm and blues  and country and western could be put together in a new way   288  In The Songwriting Secrets of The Beatles  Dominic Pedler also emphasizes the importance of the way they combined genres   One of the greatest of The Beatles  achievements was the songwriting juggling act they managed for most of their career  Far from moving sequentially from one genre to another  as is sometimes conveniently suggested  the group maintained in parallel their mastery of the traditional  catchy chart hit while simultaneously forging rock and dabbling with a wide range of peripheral influences from Country to vaudeville  One of these threads was their take on folk music  which would form such essential groundwork for their later collisions with Indian music and philosophy   289  As the personal relationships between the band members grew increasingly strained  their individual tastes became more apparent  The minimalistic cover artwork for the White Album contrasted with the complexity and diversity of its music  which encompassed Lennon s  Revolution 9   whose musique concr te approach was influenced by Yoko Ono  Starr s country song  Don t Pass Me By   Harrison s rock ballad  While My Guitar Gently Weeps   and the  proto metal roar  of McCartney s  Helter Skelter   195  Contribution of George Martin George Martin s close involvement in his role as producer made him one of the leading candidates for the informal title of  fifth Beatle   290  He brought his classical musical training to bear in various ways  291  The string quartet accompaniment to  Yesterday  was his idea the band members were initially unenthusiastic about the concept  but the result was a revelation to them  292  Gould also describes how   as Lennon and McCartney became progressively more ambitious in their songwriting  Martin began to function as an informal music teacher to them   This  coupled with his willingness to experiment in response to their suggestions such as adding  something baroque  to a particular recording facilitated their creative development  292  As well as scoring orchestral arrangements for recordings  Martin often performed  playing instruments including piano  organ and brass  293  Looking back on the making of Sgt  Pepper  Martin said    Sergeant Pepper  itself didn t appear until halfway through making the album  It was Paul s song  just an ordinary rock number and not particularly brilliant as songs go     But when we had finished it  Paul said   Why don t we make the album as though the Pepper band really existed  as though Sergeant Pepper was making the record  We ll dub in effects and things   I loved the idea  and from that moment on it was as though Pepper had a life of its own   294  Recalling how strongly the song contrasted with Lennon s compositions  Martin spoke too of his own stabilizing influence  Compared with Paul s songs  all of which seemed to keep in some sort of touch with reality  John s had a psychedelic  almost mystical quality     John s imagery is one of the best things about his work    tangerine trees    marmalade skies    cellophane flowers      I always saw him as an aural Salvador Dal   rather than some drug ridden record artist  On the other hand  I would be stupid to pretend that drugs didn t figure quite heavily in the Beatles  lives at that time     they knew that I  in my schoolmasterly role  didn t approve     Not only was I not into it myself  I couldn t see the need for it  and there s no doubt that  if I too had been on dope  Pepper would never have been the album it was  Perhaps it was the combination of dope and no dope that worked  who knows  295  Harrison echoed Martin s description of his stabilizing role   I think we just grew through those years together  him as the straight man and us as the loonies  but he was always there for us to interpret our madness we used to be slightly avant garde on certain days of the week  and he would be there as the anchor person  to communicate that through the engineers and on to the tape   296  In the studio See also  The Beatles  recording technology The Beatles made innovative use of technology  expanding the possibilities of recorded music  They urged experimentation by Martin and their recording engineers  regularly demanding that something new be tried because  it might just sound good   297  At the same time they constantly sought ways to put chance occurrences to creative use  Accidental guitar feedback  a resonating glass bottle  a tape loaded the wrong way round so that it played backwards any of these might be incorporated into their music  298  The Beatles  desire to create new sounds on every new recording  combined with Martin s arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as Norman Smith  Ken Townsend  and Emerick  all contributed significantly to their records from Rubber Soul and  especially  Revolver forward  298  Along with studio tricks such as sound effects  unconventional microphone placements  tape loops  double tracking and vari speed recording  they augmented their songs with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time  These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the sitar in  Norwegian Wood  This Bird Has Flown   and the swarmandal in  Strawberry Fields Forever   299  They also used early electronic instruments such as the Mellotron  with which McCartney supplied the flute voices on the  Strawberry Fields  intro  300  and the clavioline  an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe like sound on  Baby  You re a Rich Man   301  Legacy See also  The Beatles  influence on popular culture The Beatles  influence on popular culture was and remains immense  Former Rolling Stone associate editor Robert Greenfield said   People are still looking at Picasso     at artists who broke through the constraints of their time period to come up with something that was unique and original  In the form that they worked in  in the form of popular music  no one will ever be more revolutionary  more creative and more distinctive   261  From the 1920s  the United States had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much of the world  via Hollywood movies  jazz  the music of Broadway and Tin Pan Alley and  later  the rock and roll that first emerged in Memphis  Tennessee  302  The Beatles not only triggered the British Invasion of the US  but themselves became a globally influential phenomenon  303  Their musical innovations  as well as their commercial success  inspired musicians worldwide  303  A large number of artists have acknowledged them as an influence  or have had chart successes with covers of Beatles songs  304  On radio  their arrival marked the beginning of a new era  program directors like Rick Sklar of New York s WABC went so far as to forbid DJs from playing any  pre Beatles  music  305  The Beatles redefined the album as something more than just a few hits padded out with  filler   306  They were primary innovators of the music video  307  The Shea Stadium date with which they opened their 1965 North American tour attracted what was then the largest audience in concert history and is seen as a  landmark event in the growth of the rock crowd   308  Emulation of their clothing and especially their hairstyles  which became a mark of rebellion  had a global impact on fashion  95  The Beatles changed the way people listened to popular music and experienced its role in their lives  309  310  From what began as the Beatlemania fad  the group grew to be perceived by their young fans across the industrialized world as the representatives  even the embodiment  of ideals associated with cultural transfiguration  309  311  As icons of the 1960s counterculture  they became a catalyst for bohemianism and activism in various social and political arenas  fuelling such movements as women s liberation  gay liberation and environmentalism  309  Particularly after the  more popular than Jesus  controversy in 1966  the Beatles felt considerable pressure to say the right things and  began a concerted effort to spread a message of wisdom and higher consciousness   135  Awards and achievements See also  List of awards and

Beatles ranked number one  315  As of 2012  they hold the record for most number one hits on the Hot 100 chart with 20  316  In 2009  the Recording Industry Association of America certified that the

1963 by music publisher Dick James especially for Lennon and McCartney  though it would later acquire songs by other artists  The company was organised with James and his partner  Emmanuel Silver  owning a controlling interest  variously described as 51  or 50  plus one share  McCartney had 20   Reports again vary concerning Lennon s portion 19 or 20  and Brian Epstein s 9 or 10  which he received in lieu of a 25  band management fee  320  321  322  In 1965 the company went public  Five million shares were created  of which the original principals retained 3 75 million  James and Silver each had 937 500 shares  that is  each had 18 75  of the total 5 million   Lennon and McCartney each had 750 000 shares  15  each   and Epstein s management company  NEMS Enterprises  had 375 000 shares  7 5    Of the 1 25 million shares put up for sale  Harrison and Starr each acquired 40 000  323  At the time of the stock offering  Lennon and McCartney renewed their initial three year publishing contracts  binding them to Northern Songs until 1973  324  Harrison created Harrisongs to represent his solo compositions  but signed a three year contract with Northern Songs that gave it the copyright to his work during that period  which included  Taxman  and  Within You Without You   325  The few songs on which Starr received cowriting credit before 1968  such as  What Goes On   were also all Northern Songs copyrights  326  Harrison did not renew his contract with Northern Songs when it ended in March 1968  signing with Apple Publishing instead while retaining the copyright to his work from that point forward  Harrisongs thus owns the rights to his later Beatles songs such as  While My Guitar Gently Weeps  and  Something   That year  as well  Starr created Startling Music  which holds the rights to his solo Beatles compositions   Don t Pass Me By  and  Octopus s Garden   327  328  In March 1969  James arranged to sell his and his partner s shares of Northern Songs to British broadcasting company Associated Television  ATV   founded by impresario Lew Grade  without first informing the band  The Beatles then bid to gain a controlling interest by attempting to work out a deal with a consortium of London brokerage firms that had accumulated a 14  holding  329  The deal collapsed in May over the objections of Lennon  who declared   I m sick of being fucked about by men in suits sitting on their fat arses in the City   330  By the end of May  ATV had acquired a majority stake in Northern Songs  controlling almost the entire Lennon McCartney catalog  as well as any future material until 1973  331  In frustration  Lennon and McCartney sold their shares to ATV in late October 1969  332  Financial losses by ATV s parent company prompted the sale of the division in 1981  when according to Billboard  McCartney offered Grade  a rumored  27 million  for the Northern Songs portion of ATV s catalog  The bid was rejected  and in 1982 ATV was sold to Australian business magnate Robert Holmes   Court for  about  70 million   333  Three years later  Michael Jackson purchased ATV for a reported  47 5 million  The acquisition gave Jackson control over the publishing rights to more than 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney  334  In a deal that earned him a reported  110 million  Jackson merged his music publishing business with Sony in 1995  creating a new company  Sony ATV Music Publishing  in which he held a 50  stake  The merger made the new company  then valued at over half a billion dollars  the third largest music publisher in the world  335  Despite their lack of publishing rights to most of their songs  Lennon s estate and McCartney continue to receive their respective shares of the writers  royalties  which together are 33   of total commercial proceeds in the US and which vary elsewhere around the world between 50 and 55   336  Two of their earliest songs  Love Me Do  and  P S  I Love You  were published by an EMI subsidiary  Ardmore  amp  Beechwood  before Lennon and McCartney signed with James  McCartney acquired their publishing rights from Ardmore in the mid 1980s  337  and they are the only two Beatles songs owned by McCartney s company MPL Communications  338  References   a b Unterberger 2009a    a b Guinness 2012    Spitz 2005  pp  47 52    Spitz 2005  pp  93 99    Miles 1997  p  47    Lewisohn
