Italian Republic  Italian  Repubblica italiana note 1    is a unitary parliamentary republic in South Central Europe  To the north  it borders France  Switzerland  Austria and Slovenia along the Alps  To the south  it consists of the entirety of the Italian Peninsula  Sicily  Sardinia the two largest islands in the Mediterranean Sea and many other smaller islands  The independent states of San Marino and the Vatican City are enclaves within Italy  whilst Campione d Italia is an Italian exclave in Switzerland  The territory of Italy covers some 301 338 km2  116 347 sq mi  and is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate  With 60 6 million inhabitants  it is the fifth most populous country in Europe  and the 23rd most populous in the world  Rome  the capital of Italy  was for centuries a political and religious centre of Western civilisation as the capital of the Roman Empire and site of the Holy See  After the decline of the Roman Empire  Italy endured numerous invasions by foreign peoples  from Germanic tribes such as the Lombards and Ostrogoths  to the Byzantines and later  the Normans  among others  Centuries later  Italy became the birthplace of Maritime republics and the Renaissance  7  an immensely fruitful intellectual movement that would prove to be integral in shaping the subsequent course of European thought  Through much of its post Roman history  Italy was fragmented into numerous city and regional states  such as the Republic of Venice and the Church State   but was unified in 1861  8  following a tumultuous period in history known as  Il Risorgimento    The Resurgence    In the late 19th century  through World War I  and to World War II  Italy possessed a colonial empire  which extended its rule to Libya  Eritrea  Somalia  Ethiopia  Albania  the Dodecanese and a concession in Tianjin  China  9  Modern Italy is a democratic republic  It has been ranked as the world s 24th most developed country 10  and its Quality of life index has been ranked

very wide  19  According to one of the more common explanations  the term Italia  from Latin  Italia  20  was borrowed through Greek from the Oscan V teli   meaning  land of young cattle   cf  Lat vitulus  calf   Umb vitlo  calf    21  The bull was a symbol of the southern Italian tribes and was often depicted goring the Roman wolf as a defiant symbol of free Italy during the Social War  Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus states this account together with the legend that Italy was named after Italus  22  mentioned also by Aristotle 23  and Thucydides  24  The name Italia originally applied only to a part of what is now Southern Italy according to Antiochus of Syracuse  the southern portion of the Bruttium peninsula  modern Calabria  province of Reggio  and part of the provinces of Catanzaro and Vibo Valentia   But by his time Oenotria and Italy had become synonymous  and the name also applied to most of Lucania as well  The Greeks gradually came to apply the name  Italia  to a larger region  but it was during the reign of Emperor Augustus  end of the first century BC  that the term was expanded to cover the entire peninsula until the Alps  25  History Main article  History of Italy Prehistory and antiquity Main articles  Prehistoric Italy and Ancient Rome The Colosseum in Rome  built ca  70   80 AD  is considered one of the greatest works of Roman architecture and engineering  Excavations throughout Italy reveal a modern human presence dating back to the Paleolithic period  some 200 000 years ago  26  The Italic tribes of pre Roman Italy   such as the Umbrians  the Latins  from which the Romans emerged   Volsci  Samnites  the Celts and the Ligures which inhabited northern Italy  and many others   are most of Indo European stock  main historic peoples of non Indo European heritage include the Etruscans  the Elymians and Sicani in Sicily and the prehistoric Sardinians  Between the 17th and the 11th century BC Mycenaean Greeks established contacts with Italy 27  28  29  30  31  32  33  and in the 8th and 7th centuries BC Greek colonies were established all along the coast of Sicily and the southern part of the Italian Peninsula became known as Magna Graecia  Also the Phoenicians established colonies on the coasts of Sardinia and Sicily  Ancient Rome was at first a small agricultural community founded c  the 8th century BC  that grew over the course of the centuries into a colossal empire encompassing the whole Mediterranean Sea  in which Ancient Greek and Roman cultures merged into one civilization  This civilization was so influential that parts of it survive in modern law  administration  philosophy and arts  forming the ground that Western civilization is based upon  In a slow decline since the late 2th century AD  the empire finally broke into two parts in 395 AD  the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire  The western part   under the pressure of the Franks  the Vandals  the Huns  the Goths and other populations from Eastern Europe   finally dissolved in 476 AD  when the last western Emperor was deposed by the Barbarian chief Odoacer  Middle Ages Main article  Italy in the Middle Ages Italy s Naval Jack  featuring the coats of arms of the four major Maritime Republics  Clockwise from upper left  Venice  Genoa  Pisa  Amalfi  After the fall of Rome  Italy was conquered by the Germanic Tribe of the Ostrogoths  but in the 6th century the East Roman Emperor Justinian reconquered it  The invasion of another Germanic tribe  the Lombards  late in the same century reduced the Byzantine presence to a strip of land between Ravenna and Rome plus other lands in southern Italy  breaking the unity of the peninsula until 1870  The Lombard reign of northern and central Italy was absorbed into the Frankish Empire by Charlemagne in the late 8th century  The Frankish kings also helped the formation of the Papal States in central Italy  extending from Rome to Ravenna  although for most of the Middle Ages the Papacy effectively controlled only Latium  The existence of this theocratic state hindered for centuries the unification of the peninsula  Until the 13th century  Italian politics were dominated by the relationship between the German Holy Roman Emperors and the popes  with most of the Italian cities siding for the former  Ghibellini  or for the latter  Guelfi  depending from momentary convenience  It was during this vacuum of authority that the Italy saw the rise of a peculiar institution  the medieval commune  In the anarchic conditions that often prevailed in medieval Italian city states  people organised themselves to restore order and disarm the feuding elites  In the 12th century  a league of comuni  the Lombard League  defeated the German emperor Frederick Barbarossa  leading to a process granting effective independence to most of northern and central Italian cities  Despite the devastation of the numerous wars  Italy maintained  especially in the north and center  a relatively developed urban civilization  During the same period  Italy saw the rise of numerous Maritime Republics  the most notable being Venice  Genoa  Pisa and Amalfi  Heavily involved in the Crusades  they took advantage of political and trading opportunities  Venice and Genoa soon became Europe s main gateways to trade with the East  establishing colonies as far as the Black Sea and often controlling most of the trade with the Byzantine Empire and the Islamic Mediterranean world  The county of Savoy expanded its territory into the peninsula in the late Middle Ages  while Florence developed into a highly organized commercial and financial city state  becoming for many centuries the European capital of silk  wool  banking and jewelry  In the south  Byzantine Sicily had become an Islamic emirate in the 9th century  thriving until the Italo Normans conquered it in the late 11th century together with most of the Lombard and Byzantine states of southern Italy  Through a complex series of events  southern Italy developed as a unified kingdom  first under the House of Hohenstaufen  then under the Capetian House of Anjou and  from the 15th century  the house of Aragon  although Sicily was a separate Aragonese kingdom from the late 13th to the 15th century   In Sardinia  the former Byzantine provinces became independent states known as giudicati  although most of the island was under Genoese or Pisan control until the Aragonese conquered it in the 15th century  Early Modern Main articles  Italian Renaissance  Italian Wars  and Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy The Vitruvian man by Leonardo da Vinci  representing the ideal human proportions as described by Roman architect Vitruvius  is a quintessential masterpiece of the Renaissance  The Black Death pandemic in 1348 left its mark on Italy by killing one third of the population  34  35  However  the recovery from the disaster of the Black Death led to a resurgence of cities  trade and economy which greatly stimulated the successive phases of Humanism and Renaissance  cultural movements both born in the peninsula  and later spread in Europe  In the 14th and 15th centuries  Northern and upper Central Italy were divided into a number of warring city states  the rest of the peninsula being occupied by the larger Papal States and Naples  The strongest among these city states annexed the surrounding territories giving birth to the Signorie  regional states led by merchant families which founded local dynasties  Dominated by merchant oligarchies  they enjoyed a relative freedom and nurtured academic and artistic advancement  Warfare between the states was common  invasion from outside Italy confined to intermittent sorties of Holy Roman Emperors  These wars were primarily fought by armies of mercenaries known as condottieri  bands of soldiers drawn from around Europe  but especially Germany and Switzerland  led largely by Italian captains  36  Decades of fighting eventually saw Florence  Milan and Venice emerge as the dominant players that agreed to the Peace of Lodi in 1454  which saw relative calm brought to the region for the first time in centuries  This peace would hold for the next forty years  and Venice s unquestioned hegemony over the sea also led to unprecedented peace for much of the rest of the 15th century  The Italian Renaissance peaked in the mid 16th century as foreign invasions plunged the region into the turmoil of the Italian Wars  However  the ideas and ideals of the Renaissance endured and even spread into the rest of Europe  setting off the Northern Renaissance  and the English Renaissance  In the meantime  the discovery of the Americas  the new routes to Asia discovered by the Portuguese and the rise of the Ottoman Empire   all factors which eroded the traditional Italian dominance in trade with the East   started the economic decline of the peninsula  The triumph of Napoleon at the Battle of Marengo placed Italy under French control and paved him the way to become Emperor  Following the Italian Wars  1494 to 1559   Italy saw a long period of relative peace  first under Habsburg Spain  1559 to 1713  and then under Habsburg Austria  1713 to 1796   The plague repeatedly returned to haunt Italy throughout the 14th to 17th centuries  In the first half of the 17th century  a plague claimed some 1 7 million victims  or about 14  of Italy s population  37  As Spain declined in the 17th century  so did its Italian possessions in Naples  Sicily  Sardinia  and Milan  Southern Italy was impoverished  stagnant  and cut off from the mainstream of events in Europe  38  Despite that  Italy kept making its contribution to the European culture  giving birth to the Baroque Style  In the 18th century  as a result of the War of Spanish Succession  Austria replaced Spain as the dominant foreign power  while the House of Savoy emerged as a major regional power expanding to Piedmont and Sardinia  In this century  the ideas of the Enlightenment influenced the Italian rulers  paving the way to reforms which started an economic recovery in northern Italy and Tuscany  During the Napoleonic Wars  the northern and central parts of the country were invaded and later partly annexed to the Empire and partly reorganized as a new Kingdom of Italy   essentially a client state of the French Empire    39  while the southern half of the peninsula was administered by Joachim Murat  Napoleon s brother in law  who was crowned as King of Naples  The 1814 Congress of Vienna restored the situation of the late 18th century  but the ideals of the French Revolution could not be eradicated  Italian unification and Liberal Italy Main articles  Italian unification and Military history of Italy during World War I The legendary  handshake of Teano  between Giuseppe Garibaldi and Victor Emmanuel II  on 26 October 1860  General Garibaldi sacrificed republican hopes for the sake of Italian unity under a monarchy  The creation of the Kingdom of Italy was the result of efforts by Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the House of Savoy to establish a united state encompassing the entire Italian Peninsula  In the context of the 1848 liberal revolutions that swept through Europe  an unsuccessful war was declared on Austria  The Kingdom of Sardinia again attacked the Austrian Empire in the Second Italian War of Independence of 1859  with the aid of France  resulting in liberating Lombardy  In 1860 61  Giuseppe Garibaldi led the drive for unification in Naples and Sicily  40  allowing the Sardinian government led by the Count of Cavour to declare a united Italian kingdom on 17 March 1861  In 1866  Victor Emmanuel II allied with Prussia during the Austro Prussian War  waging the Third Italian War of Independence which allowed Italy to annex Venetia  Finally  as France during the disastrous Franco Prussian War of 1870 abandoned its garrisons in Rome  the Savoy rushed to fill the power gap by taking over the Papal States  Italian infantrymen in 1916  More than 650 000 Italian soldiers lost their lives on the battlefields of World War I  The Sardinian Albertine Statute of 1848  extended to the whole Kingdom of Italy in 1861  provided for basic freedoms  but electoral laws excluded the non propertied and uneducated classes from voting  The government of the new kingdom took place in a framework of parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberal forces  In 1913  male universal suffrage was adopted  As Northern Italy quickly industrialized  the South and rural areas of North remained underdeveloped and overpopulated  forcing millions of people to migrate abroad  while the Italian Socialist Party constantly increased in strength  challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment  Starting from the last two decades of the 19th century  Italy developed into a colonial power by forcing Somalia  Eritrea and later Libya and the Dodecanese under its rule  41  During World War I  Italy at first stayed neutral  but in 1915 signed the Treaty of London  entering the Entente on the promise of receiving Trento  Trieste  Gorizia and Gradisca  Istria and northern Dalmatia from the Austro Hungarian Empire   as well as parts of the Ottoman Empire  During the war  more than 650 000 Italian soldiers died  42  and the economy collapsed  Under the Peace Treaties of Saint Germain  Rapallo and Rome  Italy obtained most of the promised territories  including the Hungarian harbour of Fiume  but not Dalmatia  except Zara   allowing nationalists to define the victory as  mutilated   Fascist regime Main articles  Italian Fascism and Military history of Italy during World War II Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler in 1940  The turbulence that followed the devastation of World War I  inspired by the Russian Revolution  led to turmoil and anarchy  The liberal establishment  fearing a socialist revolution  started to endorse the small National Fascist Party  led by Benito Mussolini  In October 1922 the fascists attempted a coup  the  March on Rome    supported by king Victor Emmanuel III  Over the next few years  Mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties  thus forming a dictatorship  In 1935  Mussolini invaded Ethiopia  resulting in an international alienation and leading to Italy s withdrawal from the League of Nations  Consequently  Italy allied with Nazi Germany and Empire of Japan and strongly supported Franco in the Spanish civil war  In 1939  Italy occupied Albania  a de facto protectorate for decades  and entered World War II in June 1940 on the side of the Axis powers  Mussolini  wanting a quick victory like Hitler s Blitzkriegs in Poland and France  invaded Greece in October 1940  but was forced to accept a humiliating stalemate after a few months  At the same time  Italy  after initially conquering British Somalia and parts of Egypt  saw an allied counter attack lead to the loss of all possessions in the Horn of Africa and in North Africa  Italy was then invaded by the Allies in July 1943  leading to the collapse of the Fascist regime and the fall of Mussolini  In September 1943  Italy surrendered  The country remained a battlefield for the rest of the war  as the allies were moving up from the south as the north was the base for loyalist Italian fascist and German Nazi forces  fought also by the Italian resistance movement  The hostilities ended on 2 May 1945  Nearly half a million Italians  including civilians  died in the conflict  43  and the Italian economy had been all but destroyed  per capita income in 1944 was at its lowest point since the beginning of the 20th century  44  Italian Republic Main article  History of the Italian Republic The Constitution of Italy  come into force in 1948  Italy became a republic after a referendum 45  held on 2 June 1946  a day celebrated since as Republic Day  This was also the first time that Italian women were entitled to vote  46 Victor Emmanuel III s son  Umberto II  was forced to abdicate and exiled  The Republican Constitution was approved on 1 January 1948  Under the Paris Peace Treaties of 1947  the eastern border area was lost to Yugoslavia  and  later  the Free Territory of Trieste was divided between the two states  Fears in the Italian electorate of a possible Communist takeover proved crucial for the first universal suffrage electoral outcome on 18 April 1948  when the Christian Democrats  under the leadership of Alcide De Gasperi  obtained a landslide victory  Consequently  in 1949 Italy became a member of NATO  The Marshall Plan helped to revive the Italian economy which  until the late 1960s  enjoyed a period of sustained economic growth commonly called the  Economic Miracle   In 1957  Italy was a founding member of the European Economic Community  EEC   which became the European Union  EU  in 1993  The 1957 Treaties of Rome signing ceremony  Italy is a founding member of the European Union  From the late 1960s until the early 1980s  the country experienced the Years of Lead  a period characterized by economic crisis  especially after the 1973 oil crisis   widespread social conflicts and terrorist massacres carried out by opposing extremist groups  with the alleged involvement of US intelligence  47  48  49  The Years of Lead culminated in the assassination of the Christian Democrat leader Aldo Moro in 1978  an event that deeply affected the whole country  In the 1980s  for the first time since 1945  two governments were led by non Christian Democrat premiers  one liberal  Giovanni Spadolini  and one socialist  Bettino Craxi   the Christian Democrats remained  however  the main government party  During Craxi s government  the economy recovered and Italy became the world s fifth largest industrial nation  gaining entry into the G7 Group  However  as a result of his spending policies  the Italian national debt skyrocketed during the Craxi era  soon passing 100  of the GDP  In the early 1990s  Italy faced significant challenges  as voters   disenchanted with political paralysis  massive public debt and the extensive corruption system  known as Tangentopoli  uncovered by the  Clean Hands  investigation   demanded radical reforms  The scandals involved all major parties  but especially those in the government coalition  the Christian Democrats  who ruled for almost 50 years  underwent a severe crisis and eventually disbanded  splitting up into several factions  The Communists reorganized as a social democratic force  During the 1990s and the 2000s  decade   centre right  dominated by media magnate Silvio Berlusconi  and centre left coalitions alternatively governed the country  which entered a prolonged period of economic stagnation  Geography Main article  Geography of Italy Topographic map of Italy  Italy is located in Southern Europe and comprises the boot shaped Italian Peninsula and a number of islands including the two largest  Sicily and Sardinia  It lies between latitudes 35  and 47  N  and longitudes 6  and 19  E  Although the country comprises the Italian peninsula and most of the southern Alpine basin  some of Italy s territory extends beyond the Alpine basin and some islands are located outside the Eurasian continental shelf  These territories are the comuni of  Livigno  Sexten  Innichen  Toblach  in part   Chiusaforte  Tarvisio  Graun im Vinschgau  in part   which are all part of the Danube s drainage basin  while the Val di Lei constitutes part of the Rhine s basin and the islands of Lampedusa and Lampione are on the African continental shelf  The country s total area is 301 230 km   of which 294 020 km  is land and 7 210 km  is water  Including the islands  Italy has a coastline and border of 7 600 km on the Adriatic  Ionian  Tyrrhenian seas  740 km   and borders shared with France  488 km   Austria  430 km   Slovenia  232 km  and Switzerland  San Marino  39 km  and Vatican City  3 2 km   both enclaves  account for the remainder  Mont Blanc is the highest point in Italy and the European Union  The Apennine Mountains form the peninsula s backbone and the Alps form its northern boundary  where Italy s highest point is located on Mont Blanc  4 810 m 15 782 ft   note 2  The Po  Italy s longest river  652 km 405 mi   flows from the Alps on the western border with France and crosses the Padan plain on its way to the Adriatic Sea  The five largest lakes are  in order of diminishing size  50 Garda  367 94 km2 142 sq mi   Maggiore  212 51 km2 82 sq mi  shared with Switzerland   Como  145 9 km2 56 sq mi   Trasimeno  124 29 km2 48 sq mi  and Bolsena  113 55 km2 44 sq mi   The country is situated at the meeting point of the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate  leading to considerable seismic and volcanic activity  There are 14 volcanoes in Italy  three of which are active  Etna  the traditional site of Vulcan s smithy   Stromboli and Vesuvius  Vesuvius is the only active volcano in mainland Europe and is most famous for the destruction of Pompeii and Herculanum  Several islands and hills have been created by volcanic activity  and there is still a large active caldera  the Campi Flegrei north west of Naples  Environment See also  List of national parks of Italy and List of regional parks of Italy Map of national parks in Italy  After its quick industrial growth  Italy took a long time to confront its environmental problems  After several improvements  it now ranks 84th in the world for ecological sustainability  51 National parks cover about five percent of the country  52  In the last decade  Italy has become one of the world s leading producers of renewable energy  ranking as the world s fourth largest holder of installed solar energy capacity  53  54  and the sixth largest holder of wind power capacity in 2010  55  Renewable energies now make up about 12  of the total primary and final energy consumption in Italy  with a future target share set at 17  for the year 2020  56  Asinara island with the Aragonese Torre della Pelosa  16th century   Sardinia  However  air pollution remains a severe problem  especially in the industrialised north  reaching the tenth highest level worldwide of industrial carbon dioxide emissions in the 1990s  57  Italy is the twelfth largest carbon dioxide producer  58  59  Extensive traffic and congestion in the largest metropolitan areas continue to cause severe environmental and health issues  even if smog levels have decreased dramatically since the 1970s and 1980s  and the presence of smog is becoming an increasingly rarer phenomenon and levels of sulphur dioxide are decreasing  60  Many watercourses and coastal stretches have also been contaminated by industrial and agricultural activity  while due to rising water levels  Venice has been regularly flooded throughout recent years  Waste from industrial activity is not always disposed of by legal means and has led to permanent health effects on inhabitants of affected areas  as in the case of the Seveso disaster  The country has also operated several nuclear reactors between 1963 and 1990 but  after the Chernobyl disaster and a referendum on the issue the nuclear program was terminated  a decision that was overturned by the government in 2008  planning up to four French nuclear power plants  This was in turn struck down by a referendum following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster  61  Deforestation  illegal building developments and poor land management policies have led to significant erosion all over Italy s mountainous regions  leading to major ecological disasters like the 1963 Vajont Dam flood  the 1998 Sarno 62  and 2009 Messina mudslides  Climate Main article  Climate of Italy The coastal areas of Liguria have a Mediterranean climate  The climate of Italy is highly diverse and can be quite different from the stereotypical Mediterranean climate  Most of the inland northern regions of Italy  for example Piedmont  Lombardy and Emilia Romagna  have a climate variously described as humid continental or temperate  The climate of the  Po valley region  is  continental     with harsh winters and hot summers   63  64  The coastal areas of Liguria and most of the peninsula south of Florence generally fit the Mediterranean stereotype  K ppen climate classification Csa   Conditions on peninsular coastal areas can be very different from the interior s higher ground and valleys  particularly during the winter months when the higher altitudes tend to be cold  wet  and often snowy  The coastal regions have mild winters and warm and generally dry summers  although lowland valleys can be quite hot in summer  Administrative divisions Main articles  Regions of Italy

market economy characterized by high per capita GDP and low unemployment rates  In 2010  it was the eighth largest economy in the world and the fourth largest in Europe in terms of nominal GDP  80  and the tenth largest economy in the world and fifth largest in Europe in terms of PPP  81  It is a founding member of the G8  the Eurozone and the OECD  After World War II  Italy was rapidly transformed from an agriculture based economy into one of the world s most industrialized nations 82  and a leading country in world trade and exports  It is a developed country  with the world s 8th highest quality of life 11  and the 23rd Human Development Index  In spite of the recent global economic crisis  Italian per capita GDP at purchasing power parity remains approximately equal to the EU average  83  while the unemployment rate  8 5   stands as one of the EU s lowest  84  The country is well known for its influential and innovative business economic sector  85  an industrious and

monetary union  the Eurozone  dark blue   and of the EU single market  Italy has a smaller number of global multinational corporations than other economies of comparable size  but there is a large number of small and medium sized enterprises  notoriously clustered in several industrial districts  which are the backbone of the Italian industry  This has produced a manufacturing sector often focused on the export of niche market and luxury products  that if on one side is less capable to compete on the quantity  on the other side is more capable of facing the competition from China and other emerging Asian economies based on lower labour costs  with higher quality products  87  The country was the world s 7th largest exporter in 2009  88  Italy s closest trade ties are with the other countries of the European Union  with whom it conducts about 59  of its total trade  Its largest EU trade partners  in order of market share  are Germany  12 9    France  11 4    and Spain  7 4

2010  Italy is both the fifth most visited country and highest tourism earner in the world  90  Vineyards in the hilly area of Langhe  Piedmont  Italy is the world s top wine producer  Despite these important achievements  the Italian economy today suffers from many and relevant problems  After a strong GDP growth of 5 6  per year from the 1950s to the early 1970s  91  and a progressive slowdown in the 1980s and 1990s  the last decade s average annual growth rates poorly performed at 1 23  in comparison to an average EU annual growth rate of 2 28   92  The stagnation in economic growth  and the political efforts to revive it with massive government spending from the 1980s onwards  eventually produced a severe rise in public debt  According to the EU s statistics body Eurostat  Italian public debt stood at 116  of GDP in 2010  ranking as the second biggest debt ratio after Greece  with 126 8    93  However  the biggest chunk of Italian public debt is owned by national subjects  a major difference between Italy and Greece  94  In addition  Italian living standards have a considerable north south divide  The average GDP per capita in the north exceeds by far the EU average  whilst many regions of Southern Italy are dramatically below  95  Italy has often been referred the sick man of Europe  96  97  characterised by economic stagnation  political instability and problems in pursuing reform programs  More specifically  Italy suffers from structural weaknesses due to its geographical conformation and the lack of raw materials and energy resources  in 2006 the country imported more than 86  of its total energy consumption  99 7  of the solid fuels  92 5  of oil  91 2  of natural gas and 15  of electricity   98  99  The Italian economy is weakened by the lack of infrastructure development  market reforms and research investment  and also high public deficit  85  In the Index of Economic Freedom 2008  the country ranked 64th in the world and 29th in Europe  the lowest rating in the Eurozone  Italy still receives development assistance from the European Union every year  Between 2000 and 2006  Italy received  27 4 billion from the EU  100  The country has an inefficient state bureaucracy  low property rights protection and high levels of corruption  heavy taxation and public spending that accounts for about half of the national GDP  101  In addition  the most recent data show that Italy s spending in R amp D in 2006 was equal to 1 14  of GDP  below the EU average of 1 84  and the Lisbon Strategy target of devoting 3  of GDP to research and development activities  102  According to the Confesercenti  a major business association in Italy  organized crime in Italy represented the  biggest segment of the Italian economy   accounting for

article  Demography of Italy Population 1861 2008  Number of inhabitants  Italy has 60 626 442 inhabitants according to 1 1 2011 municipal records  Anagrafe   108  Its population density  at 201 km   520 sq  mile   is higher than that of most Western European countries  However the distribution of the population is widely uneven  The most densely populated areas are the Po Valley  that accounts for almost a half of the national population  and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples  while vast regions such as the Alps and Appennines highlands  the plateaus of Basilicata and the island of Sardinia are very sparsely populated  The population of Italy almost doubled during the 20th century  but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven due to large scale internal migration from the rural South to the industrial cities of the North  a phenomenon which happened as a consequence of the Italian economic miracle of the 1950 1960s  In addition  after centuries of net emigration  from the 1980s Italy has experienced large scale immigration for the first time in modern history  According to the Italian government  there were 4 570 317 foreign residents in Italy as of January 2011  109  High fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s  after which they start to dramatically decline  leading to rapid population aging  At the end of the 2000s  decade   one in five Italians was over 65 years old  110  However  thanks mainly to the massive immigration of the last two decades  in recent years Italy experienced a significant growth in birth rates  111  The total fertility rate has also climbed from an all time low of 1 18 children per woman in 1995 to 1 41 in 2008  112  view talk edit view talk edit Largest cities of ItalyISTAT estimates for 31 December 2010 Rank City

1898 and 1914  the peak years of Italian diaspora  approximately 750 000 Italians emigrated each year  113  Italian communities once thrived in the former African colonies of Eritrea  nearly 100 000 at the beginning of World War II   114  Somalia and Libya  150 000 Italians settled in Libya  constituting about 18  of the total population   115  All of Libya s Italians were expelled from the North African country in 1970  116  In addition  after the communist occupation of Istria in 1945  up to 350 000 ethnic Italians left Titoist Yugoslavia  117  Today  large numbers of people with full or significant Italian ancestry are found in Brazil  25 million   118  Argentina  20 million   119  US  17 8 million   120  France  5 million   121  Uruguay  1 5 million   122  Canada  1 4 million   123  Venezuela  900 000  124  and Australia  800 000   125  As a result of the profound economic and social changes induced by postwar industrialization  including low birth rates  an aging population and thus a shrinking workforce  during the 1980s Italy became to attract rising flows of foreign immigrants  The present day figure of about 4 6 million foreign residents  that make up some 7 5  of the total population  include more than half a million children born in Italy to foreign nationals second generation immigrants  but exclude foreign nationals who have subsequently acquired Italian nationality  this applied to 53 696 people in 2008  126  The official figures also exclude illegal immigrants  the so called clandestini  whose numbers are very difficult to determine  In May 2008 The Boston Globe quoted an estimate of 670 000 for this group  127  Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989  and more recently  the 2004 and 2007 enlargements of the European Union  the main waves of migration came from the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe  especially Romania  Albania  Ukraine and Poland   The second most important area of immigration to Italy has always been the neighbouring North Africa  in particular  Morocco  Egypt and Tunisia   with soaring arrivals as a consequence of the Arab Spring  Furthermore  in recent years  growing migration fluxes from the Far East  notably  China 128  and the Philippines  and Latin America  Ecuador  Peru  have been recorded  Currently  more than one million Romanians  around one tenth of them being Roma 129   are officially registered as living in Italy  representing thus the most important individual country of origin  followed by Albanians and Moroccans with about 500 000 people each  The number of unregistered Romanians is difficult to estimate  but the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network suggested that in 2007 that there might have been half a million or more  130  note 4  Overall  at the

unification of Italy  is based on the Florentine variety of Tuscan and is somewhat intermediate between the Italo Dalmatian languages and the Gallo Romance languages  Its development was also influenced by the Germanic languages of the post Roman invaders  Italy has numerous dialects spoken all over the country and some Italians cannot speak Italian at all  134  However  the establishment of a national education system has led to decrease in variation in the languages spoken across the country  Standardisation was further expanded in the 1950s and 1960s thanks to economic growth and the rise of mass media and television  the state broadcaster RAI helped set a standard Italian   Several linguistic groups are legally recognized  135  and a number of minority languages have co official status alongside Italian in various parts of the country  French is co official in the Valle d Aosta although in fact Franco Provencal is more commonly spoken there  German has the same status in the province of South Tyrol as  in some parts of that province and in parts of the neighbouring Trentino  does Ladin  Slovene is officially recognised in the provinces of Trieste  Gorizia and Udine in Friuli Venezia Giulia  In these regions official documents are bilingual  trilingual in Ladin communities   or available upon request in either Italian or the co official language  Traffic signs are also multilingual  except in the Valle d Aosta where   with the exception of Aosta itself which has retained its Latin form in Italian  as in English    French toponyms are generally

Protestant  Waldensians  Eastern Orthodox and other Christian churches  In the 20th century  Jehovah s Witnesses  Pentecostalism  non denominational Evangelicalism  and Mormonism were the fastest growing Protestant churches  Starting from the 1980s  Immigration from Subsaharan Africa has increased the size of Baptist  Anglican  Pentecostal and Evangelical communities in Italy  while immigration from Eastern Europe has established large Eastern Orthodox communities  At the beginning of 21st century  there were more than 700 000 Eastern Orthodox Christians in Italy  including 180

However  with the creation of the Nazi backed puppet Italian Social Republic  about 15  of Italy s Jews were killed  despite the Fascist government s refusal to deport Jews to Nazi death camps  This  together with the emigration that preceded and followed the Second World War  has left only a small community of around 45 000 Jews in Italy today  Due to rising immigration  there has been an increase in non Christian faiths  In 2009  there were 1 0 million Muslims in Italy 147  forming 1 6 percent of population although  only 50 000 hold Italian citizenship  Independent estimates put the

and the world remain immense  Italy is home to the greatest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites  47  to date  and has rich collections of art  culture and literature from many different periods  The

Italy  Notable artists who fall within these periods include Michelangelo  Leonardo da Vinci  Donatello  Botticelli  Fra Angelico  Tintoretto  Caravaggio  Bernini  Titian and Raphael  Thereafter
