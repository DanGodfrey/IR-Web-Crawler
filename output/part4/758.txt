of PCs after signing a pivotal contract  IBM called Microsoft in July 1980 inquiring about programming languages for its upcoming PC line  2  after failed negotiations with another company  IBM gave Microsoft a contract to develop the OS for the new line of PCs  3  Early history Paul Allen and Bill Gates  childhood friends with a passion in computer programming  were seeking to make a successful business utilizing their shared skills  The January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics featured Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems s  MITS  Altair 8800 microcomputer  Allen noticed that they could program a BASIC interpreter for the device  after a call from Gates claiming to have a working interpreter  MITS requested a demonstration  Since they didn t actually have one  Allen worked on a simulator for the Altair while Gates developed the interpreter  Although they developed the interpreter on a simulator and not the actual device  the interpreter worked flawlessly when they demonstrated the interpreter to MITS in Albuquerque  New Mexico in March 1975  MITS agreed to distribute it  marketing it as Altair BASIC  4  They officially established Microsoft on April 4  1975  with Gates as the CEO  5  Allen came up with the original name of  Micro Soft   as recounted in a 1995 Fortune magazine article  In August 1977 the company formed an agreement with ASCII Magazine in Japan  resulting in its first international office   ASCII Microsoft   6  The company moved to a new home in Bellevue  Washington in January 1979  5  Microsoft Inc  logo history Logo Years Microsoft  blibbet  logo  filed August 26  1982 at the USPTO and used until 1987  7  Microsoft  Pac Man  logo  designed by Scott Baker and used since 1987  with the 1994 2002 slogan  Where do you want to go today    8  9  Microsoft logo as of 2006 2011  with the slogan  Your potential  Our passion   9  Logo by Microsoft with the slogan Be What s Next   2011 present  10  Microsoft entered the OS business in 1980 with its own version of Unix  called Xenix  11  However  it was DOS  Disk Operating System  that solidified the company s dominance  After negotiations with Digital Research failed  IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft in November 1980 to provide a version of the CP M OS  which was set to be used in the upcoming IBM Personal Computer  IBM PC   12  For this deal  Microsoft purchased a CP M clone called 86 DOS from Seattle Computer Products  branding it as MS DOS  which IBM rebranded to PC DOS  Following the release of the IBM PC in August 1981  Microsoft retained ownership of MS DOS  Since IBM copyrighted the IBM PC BIOS  other companies had to reverse engineer it in order for non IBM hardware to run as IBM PC compatibles  but no such restriction applied to the operating systems  Due to various factors  such as MS DOS s available software selection citation needed   Microsoft eventually became the leading PC OS vendor  3  13  The company expanded into new markets with the release of the Microsoft Mouse in 1983  as well as a publishing division named Microsoft Press  14  Paul Allen resigned from Microsoft in February after developing Hodgkin s disease  15  1984 1994  Windows and Office While jointly developing a new OS with IBM in 1984  OS 2  Microsoft released Microsoft Windows  a graphical extension for MS DOS  on November 20  16  Microsoft moved its headquarters to Redmond on February 26  1986  and on March 13 the company went public  17  the ensuing rise in the stock would make an estimated four billionaires and 12 000 millionaires from

clashes with the U S  Government  19  Microsoft announced the release of its version of OS 2 to original equipment manufacturers  OEMs  on April 2  1987  20  meanwhile  the company was at work on a 32 bit OS  Microsoft Windows NT  using ideas from OS 2  it shipped on July 21  1993 with a new modular kernel and the Win32 application programming interface  API   making porting from 16 bit  MS DOS based  Windows easier  Once Microsoft informed IBM of NT  the OS 2 partnership deteriorated  21  Microsoft introduced its office suite  Microsoft Office  in 1990  The software bundled separate office productivity applications  such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel  22  On May 22 Microsoft launched Windows 3 0 with a streamlined user interface graphics and improved protected mode capability for the Intel 386 processor  23  Both Office and Windows became dominant in their respective areas  24  25 Novell  a Word competitor from 1984 1986  filed a lawsuit years later claiming that Microsoft left part of its APIs undocumented in order to gain a competitive advantage  26  On July 27  1994  the U S  Department of Justice  Antitrust Division filed a Competitive Impact Statement that said  in part   Beginning in 1988  and continuing until July 15  1994  Microsoft induced many OEMs to execute anticompetitive  per processor  licenses  Under a per processor license  an OEM pays Microsoft a royalty for each computer it sells containing a particular microprocessor  whether the OEM sells the computer with a Microsoft operating system or a non Microsoft operating system  In effect  the royalty payment to Microsoft when no Microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty  or tax  on the OEM s use of a competing PC operating system  Since 1988  Microsoft s use of per processor licenses has increased   27  1995 2005  Internet and the 32 bit era Bill Gates giving his deposition in 1998 for the United States v  Microsoft trial  Once the U S  Department of Justice 1993 took over from the Federal Trade Commission  a protracted legal wrangling between Microsoft and the department ensued  resulting in various settlements and possible blocked mergers  Microsoft would point to companies such as AOL Time Warner in its defense  19  Following Bill Gates s internal  Internet Tidal Wave memo  on May 26  1995 Microsoft began to redefine its offerings and expand its product line into computer networking and the World Wide Web  28  The company released Windows 95 on August 24  1995  featuring pre emptive multitasking  a completely new user interface with a novel start button  and 32 bit compatibility  similar to NT  it provided the Win32 API  29  30  Windows 95 came bundled with the online service MSN  and for OEMs Internet Explorer  a web browser  Internet Explorer was not bundled with the retail Windows 95 boxes because the boxes were printed before the team finished the web browser  and instead was included in the Windows 95 Plus  pack  31  Branching out into new markets in 1996  Microsoft and NBC Universal created a new 24 7 cable news station  MSNBC  32  Microsoft created Windows CE 1 0  a new OS designed for devices with low memory and other constraints  such as personal digital assistants  33  In October 1997  the Justice Department filed a motion in the Federal District Court  stating that Microsoft violated an agreement signed in 1994 and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows  34  Bill Gates handed over the CEO position on January 13  2000 to Steve Ballmer  an old college friend of Gates and employee of the company since 1980  creating a new position for himself as Chief Software Architect  5  35  Various companies including Microsoft formed the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance in October 1999 to  among other things  increase security and protect intellectual property through identifying changes in hardware and software  Critics decry the alliance as a way to enforce indiscriminate restrictions over how consumers use software  and over how computers behave  a form of digital rights management  for example the scenario where a computer is not only secured for its owner  but also secured against its owner as well  36  37  On April 3  2000  a judgment was handed down in the case of United States v  Microsoft  38  calling the company an  abusive monopoly   39  it settled with the U S  Department of Justice in 2004  17  On October 25  2001 Microsoft released Windows XP  unifying the mainstream and NT lines under the NT codebase  40  The company released the Xbox later that year  entering the game console market dominated by Sony and Nintendo  41  In March 2004 the European Union brought antitrust legal action against the company  citing it abused its dominance with the Windows OS  resulting in a judgment of  497 million   613 million  and to produce new versions of Windows XP without Windows Media Player  Windows XP Home Edition N and Windows XP Professional N  42  43  2006 present  Windows Vista  mobile  SaaS CEO Steve Ballmer at the MIX event in 2008  In an interview about his management style in 2005  he mentioned that his first priority was to get the people he delegates to in order  Ballmer also emphasized the need to continue pursuing new technologies even if initial attempts fail  citing the original attempts with Windows as an example  44  Released in January 2007  the next version of Windows  Windows Vista  focused on features  security  and a redesigned user interface dubbed Aero  45  46 Microsoft Office 2007  released at the same time  featured a  Ribbon  user interface which was a significant departure from its predecessors  Relatively strong sales of both titles helped to produce a record profit in 2007  47  The European Union imposed another fine of  899 million   1 4 billion  for Microsoft s lack of compliance with the March 2004 judgment on February 27  2008  saying that the company charged rivals unreasonable prices for key information about its workgroup and backoffice servers  Microsoft stated that it was in compliance and that  these fines are about the past issues that have been resolved

public  Windows 7 s focus was on refining Vista with ease of use features and performance enhancements  rather than a large reworking of Windows  51  52  53  As the smartphone industry boomed beginning in 2007  Microsoft struggled to keep up with its rivals Apple and Google in providing a modern smartphone operating system  As a result  in 2010  Microsoft revamped their aging flagship mobile operating system  Windows Mobile  replacing it with the new Windows Phone OS  along with a new strategy in the smartphone industry that has Microsoft working more closely with smartphone manufactures  such as Nokia  and to provide a consistent user experience across all smartphones using Microsoft s Windows Phone OS  Microsoft is a founding member of the Open Networking Foundation

progressive the organization deems company policies towards LGBT  lesbian  gay  bisexual and transsexual  employees  rated Microsoft as 87  from 2002 to 2004 and as 100  from 2005 to 2010 after they allowed gender expression  69  Criticism Main article  Criticism of Microsoft Criticism of Microsoft has followed the company s existence because of various aspects of its products and business practices  Ease of use  stability  and security of the company s software are common targets for critics  More recently  Trojan horses and other exploits have plagued numerous users due to faults in the security of Microsoft Windows and other programs  Microsoft is also accused of locking vendors into their products  and of not following and complying with existing standards in its software  70 Total cost of ownership comparisons of Linux as well as Mac OS X to Windows are a continuous point of debate  The company has been in numerous lawsuits by several governments and other companies for unlawful monopolistic practices  In 2004  the European Union found Microsoft guilty in a highly publicized anti trust case  Additionally  Microsoft s EULA for some of its programs is often criticized as being too restrictive as well as being against open source software  Criticism of the company has resulted in it being deemed  the evil empire  by some  71  In a sci fi allusion  Microsoft has also been called  The Borg  after the fictional race of aliens in the Star Trek universe  It reflects the perception that Microsoft often acquires technology from other companies rather than developing it in house 72   as well as to Microsoft s ability to adapt to and overwhelm its opponents  strategies   73  74  75  76  77  78  Corporate affairs The company is run by a board of directors made up of

opening stock price was  21  after the trading day  the price closed at  27 75  As of July 2010  with the company s nine stock splits  any IPO shares would be multiplied by 288  if one was to buy the IPO today given the splits and other factors  it would cost about 9 cents  82  83  84  The stock price peaked in 1999 at around  119   60 928 adjusting for splits   85  The company began to offer a dividend on January 16  2003  starting at eight cents per share for the fiscal year followed by a dividend of sixteen cents per share the subsequent year  switching from yearly to quarterly dividends in 2005 with eight cents a share per quarter and a special one time payout of three dollars per share for the second quarter of the fiscal year  85  86  Though the company had subsequent increases in dividend payouts  the price of Microsoft s stock remained steady for years  86  87  One of Microsoft s business tactics  described by an executive as  embrace  extend and extinguish   initially embraces a competing standard or product  then extends it to produce their own version which is then incompatible with the standard  which in time extinguishes competition that does not or cannot use Microsoft s new version  88  Various companies and governments sue Microsoft over this set of tactics  resulting in billions of dollars in rulings against the company  89  38  43  Microsoft claims that the original strategy is not anti competitive  but rather an exercise of its discretion to implement features it believes customers want  90  Financial Standard and Poor s and Moody s have both given a AAA rating to Microsoft  whose assets were valued at  41 billion as compared to only  8 5 billion in unsecured debt  Consequently  in February 2011 Microsoft released a corporate bond amounting to  2 25 billion with relatively low borrowing rates compared to government bonds  91  For the first time in 20 years Apple Inc  surpassed Microsoft in Q1 2011 quarterly profits and revenues due to a slowdown in PC sales and continuing huge losses in Microsoft s Online Services Division  which contains its search engine Bing   Microsoft profits were  5 2 billion  while Apple Inc  profits were  6 billion  on revenues of  14 5 billion and  24 7 billion respectively  92  Microsoft s Online Services Division has been continuously loss making since 2006 and in Q1 2011 it lost  726 million  This follows a loss of  2 5 billion for the year 2010  93  Environment Microsoft is ranked on the 17th place in Greenpeace s Guide to Greener Electronics that ranks 18 electronics manufacturers according to their policies on toxic chemicals  recycling and climate change  94  Microsoft s timeline for phasing out BFRs and phthalates in all products is 2012 but its commitment to phasing out PVC is not clear  As yet  January 2011  it has no products that are completely free from PVC and BFRs  95  Microsoft s main U S  campus received a silver certification from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design  LEED  program in 2008  and it installed over 2 000 solar panels on top of its buildings in its Silicon Valley campus  generating approximately 15 percent of the total energy needed by the facilities in April 2005  96  Microsoft makes use of alternative forms of transit  It created one of the worlds largest private bus systems  the  Connector   to transport people from outside the company  for on campus transportation  the  Shuttle Connect  uses a large fleet of hybrid cars to save fuel  The company also subsidises regional public transport as an incentive  96  97  In February 2010 however  Microsoft took a stance against adding additional public transport and high occupancy vehicle  HOV  lanes to a bridge connecting Redmond to Seattle  the company did not want to delay the construction any further  98  Microsoft was ranked number 1 in the list of the World s Best Multinational Workplaces by the Great Place to Work Institute in 2011  99  Marketing In 2004  Microsoft commissioned research firms to do independent studies comparing the total cost of ownership  TCO  of Windows Server 2003 to Linux  the firms concluded that companies found Windows easier to administrate than Linux  thus those using Windows would administrate faster resulting in lower costs for their company  i e  lower TCO   100  This spurred a wave of related studies  a study by the Yankee Group concluded that upgrading from one version of Windows Server to another costs a fraction of the switching costs from Windows Server to Linux  although companies surveyed noted the increased security and reliability of Linux servers and concern about being locked into using Microsoft products  101  Another study  released by the OSDL  claimed that the Microsoft studies were  simply outdated and one sided  and their survey concluded that the TCO of Linux was lower due to Linux administrators managing more servers on average and other reasons  102  As part of the  Get the Facts  campaign Microsoft highlighted the  NET trading platform that it had developed in partnership with Accenture for the London Stock Exchange  claiming that it provided  five nines  reliability  After suffering extended downtime and unreliability 103  104  the LSE announced in 2009 that it was planning to drop its Microsoft solution and switch to a Linux based one in 2010  105  106  Microsoft adopted the so called  Pac Man Logo   designed by Scott Baker  in 1987  Baker stated  The new logo  in Helvetica italic typeface  has a slash between the o and s  to emphasize the  soft  part of the name and convey motion and speed   107  Dave Norris ran an internal joke campaign to save the old logo  which was green  in all uppercase  and featured a fanciful letter O  nicknamed the blibbet  but it was discarded  108  Microsoft s logo with the  Your potential  Our passion   tagline below the main corporate name  is based on a slogan Microsoft used in 2008  In 2002  the company started using the logo in the United States and eventually started a TV campaign with the slogan  changed from the previous tagline of  Where do you want to go today    8  9  109  During the private MGX  Microsoft Global Exchange  conference in 2010  Microsoft unveiled the company s next tagline   Be What s Next    as well as a new logo scheduled for use sometime in the future  10  See also Microsoft portal
