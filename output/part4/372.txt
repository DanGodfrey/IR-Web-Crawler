Chris Claremont and Dave Cockrum   edit  Fictional character biography The Phoenix Force is an immortal and mutable manifestation of the prime universal force of life and passion  Born of the void between states of being  the Phoenix Force is a child of the universe  It is the nexus of all psionic energy which does  has  and ever will exist in all realities of the omniverse  the Guardian of Creation  and of the dangerously powerful M Kraan Crystal  The Phoenix is among the most feared beings in all of existence   having the power to cut and re grow any part of the universe  as well as destroy it entirely  which is part of the Phoenix s purpose   The Judgment of the Phoenix   to burn away the obsolete  The Phoenix Force is described as being  the embodiment of the very passion of Creation   the spark that gave life to the Universe  the flame that will ultimately consume it   During its time as a sentient and nameless entity  it traveled the cosmos just like other cosmic beings  At first  the Phoenix Force was a formless mass of energy  but thousands of years ago  it came to Earth  and met a magician named Feron  who worshipped the legendary Phoenix   whose daydream like visions prompted the Phoenix to adopt the firebird form it has today  He asked the Phoenix to help him by lending its energy to project a stone pillar  which resembled a lighthouse  across the multiverse  The pillar became the lighthouse base for the British super team Excalibur  a team its future host Rachel Summers herself would join   Afterwards  Feron was attacked by Necrom in an attempt to steal the power of the Phoenix  Feron  strengthened by the Phoenix Force  was able to fight back but Necrom was able to steal a fraction of the Phoenix Force s essence forcing it to flee back to space in agonized confusion  The Phoenix Force returned to Earth when it felt the mind of a human transcend the physical realm  a mind that resonated with the Phoenix Force s energy  A young Jean Grey had telepathically linked her mind to her dying friend  Annie Richards  to keep Annie s soul from moving to the afterlife  In doing so  Jean s mind was being dragged along to the  other side  with Annie  Phoenix lent its energy to break the connection  and kept close watch on young Jean  as it felt a kinship with the young mutant  Years later when Jean was dying on a space shuttle  her mind called out for help and the Phoenix Force answered and saved her  transforming Jean into Phoenix  2  The Phoenix remained with the X Men for only a short time  She prevented the complete destruction of the universe by repairing the damaged energy matrix at the core of the M Kraan Crystal  3  During a skirmish with the X Men s first and most deadly foe  Magneto  Phoenix and Beast were separated from the other X Men  with each group believing the other to have perished  4  Phoenix went on a European vacation to gather herself in this new  lonely world  In Greece  Phoenix meets a young and handsome man named Nikos  whom she spends several days with  He is revealed to be Mastermind  a mutant with the powers of illusion  He begins to plant the seeds of dissent within her fragile psyche by comparing her to a god and insisting she can do whatever she wants  5  She would later encounter him again in Scotland  under the guise of Jason Wynguarde  a handsome 18th Century loyalist  believing him to be both the work of the reality warping mutant Proteus and the lover to one of her ancestors  6   edit  The Rise of Dark Phoenix After an encounter with the Hellfire Club and manipulation by Mastermind and the White Queen  the Phoenix was transformed into their Black Queen  7  She broke free of Mastermind s control  but had been transformed into Dark Phoenix  She battled the X Men and fled to the stars  devoured the energies of the D Bari star system to satisfy her  hunger  as Dark Phoenix  annihilating the five billion inhabitants of its fourth planet  and destroyed a nearby Shi Ar observatory vessel which opened fire on her before returning to Earth  There  she was defeated in psionic combat by Professor Xavier  and regained control  The group was then teleported to space by the Shi Ar and given a trial by combat  Just as victory seemed certain for the Imperial Guard  she once again became Dark Phoenix  and ultimately committed apparent suicide on Earth s moon before the eyes of a horrified Cyclops  8  As originally written  the Jean Grey incarnation of the Phoenix was Jean herself  having attained her ultimate potential as a psi  becoming a being of pure energy and reforming herself as Phoenix  9  only to become slowly corrupted by the manipulation of such foes as Mastermind and Emma Frost  unable to adapt to her enormous power  Jean was driven mad  In order to return Jean to the fold several years later  this storyline was retconned to reveal the existence of the cosmic Phoenix Force entity  which had created a duplicate body of Jean  believed itself to be Jean  and acted in her place while the real Jean lay in a coma in the ocean  where the Avengers and Fantastic Four would later discover her  10  This allowed Jean to be revived as a member of X Factor  The extent to which the duplicate and Jean are separate entities depends on who is writing the character s  at the time  some instances portraying them as inherently separate  while others demonstrate a shared consciousness  Part of the Phoenix Force encountered a manifestation of Death after committing suicide  and then returned itself to Jean in the cocoon  Horrified by what it had done  Jean rejected it and it went on to join with Jean s clone  Madelyne Pryor  11  This portion of the Phoenix remained with Madelyne until she also committed suicide and the Phoenix consciousness rejoined with the awakened Jean  Another possessor of the Phoenix Force is Rachel Summers  Jean s daughter from the Days of Future Past alternate future  The Phoenix Force accepted her as a host  allowing her to use limited amounts of its immense powers to enhance her own  The Phoenix battles and defeats a malnourished Galactus  Art by Alan Davis  During an encounter with Galactus  Rachel Summers at the time completely overtaken by the Phoenix Force battled Galactus in an effort to save a planet he was preparing to devour  12  The Phoenix Force disrupted Galactus  feeding process and thus was able to eventually defeat the depleted world devourer in battle  Galactus accused the Phoenix Force of hypocrisy and revealed to it that every time it exercised its powers on such vast scales  it robbed energy used to birth future generations  Realizing this to be true  the Phoenix vowed never again to use its powers to such an extent   edit  Into the Future When Rachel s body finally healed  it was just as the Phoenix discovered that its actions on the physical plane were causing potential life to be used up  so it woke her and told her that her powers would be somewhat lessened  as the Phoenix was returning to its natural state  13  14  Returning to Earth with all her memories  Rachel finally managed to get back to the future she had come from  While she could not change her past  she and her teammates were able to change the directives of all the Sentinels of the era to preserve all life  thereby ending the genocide that had prevailed for years  15  On the way back to our time  however  Captain Britain was lost in the timestream and Rachel was eventually forced to switch places with him  because she really did not belong in our time  anyway  volume  amp  issue needed  She emerged from the timestream about 1900 years in the future and formed the Clan Askani  which was responsible for bringing her brother Nathan to their time to fight Apocalypse  volume  amp  issue needed  She later enconters Diamanda Nero which was Apocalypse s High Councilor and viceroy  She even wanted to overpower him  but was left powerless after shortly being bonded to the Phoenix Force  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Phoenix Resurrection Later  as an interdimensional portal transported four villains from the 616 Marvel Universe into the Ultraverse dimension  the Phoenix Force was pulled into the Ultraverse as well and was critically damaged  Needing a human host to help heal the damage  the Phoenix Force bonded with Prime  volume  amp  issue needed  and later with Amber Hunt  volume  amp  issue needed  The injury to the Phoenix Force drove it insane and Amber was unable to control it  She attacked her friends and would have destroyed the planet  if not for the arrival of the X Men and new Ultra hero Foxfire  who after a long battle were able to separate the Phoenix from Amber and send the cosmic entity back to the Earth 616 universe  volume  amp  issue needed  Jean Grey would begin to manifest Phoenix firebirds and tap into its cosmic reserves shortly before her death at the hands of Xorn  16   edit  Endsong and Warsong The Phoenix Force would return to Earth during the mini series X Men  Phoenix   Endsong  where it resurrected Jean Grey from her grave  It is not long before she remembers what she has come for   Scott Summers  a k a  Cyclops   She needs to feed from the energy from his optic blasts  and confused by Jean s emotions thinks she s in love with Scott  When she realizes Scott is in love with Emma Frost  former White Queen of the Hellfire Club and headmistress of the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning   Through a number of incidents  including Jean having Wolverine kill her a number of times  Jean trapping herself in a glacier  the Phoenix Force jumping into Emma Frost  and parts of the X Men being trapped in a Shi Ar generated event horizon  Jean Grey managed to assert herself and gain control of the Phoenix Force  with emotional support of all the X Men  Jean then declares that she and the Phoenix force are truly one entity now  have transcended into the White Phoenix of the Crown  This is signified by a new white and gold costume  17  As a result of a Shi Ar attack on the Phoenix Force  the entity is currently in an incomplete state and Jean must now search out the remaining parts of the Phoenix Force  The consequences of this were partially addressed in X Men  Phoenix   Warsong in which a small part of the Phoenix Force joined with the Stepford Cuckoos  After nearly losing control to the Phoenix power  the Stepford Cuckoos developed a secondary mutation  in which their hearts turned to diamond and they were able to imprison the piece of the Phoenix Force  18   edit  End of Greys With the failed attack on the Phoenix Force which ended with Jean Grey escaping their suicide bomb attack and returned to the White Hot Room to restore herself  the Shi ar still wanted to permanently prevent the ascension of the Phoenix Force  In hopes of eliminating the possibility of a new Omega level psionic mutant becoming a host for the Phoenix Force  the Shi ar sent to Earth a commando unit with the purpose to wipe out the Grey genome and kill Quentin Quire  These Death Comandos arrived at Rachel s family reunion site and killed all the members of the Grey family besides Rachel and Cable who weren t present  Afterward  at the graves of the Grey family  Rachel vowed a terrible vengeance on the Shi ar and was quoted as saying   I m not my mom  I m not the Phoenix  I m my own woman  And by the time I m done    they ll wish I WERE the Phoenix   19   edit  Kingbreaker During the last issue of Kingbreaker  the Phoenix mysteriously abandons Rachel and Korvus during battle with Vulcan s new guard  leaving them both without its power  As it leaves Rachel mutters  Please  not now  Mom   implying that Jean is calling back the missing pieces of the Phoenix Force  and perhaps planning another resurrection  Rachel later says that it was almost like the phoenix was never with her for she  Can t feel it    I can t hear it   It s like it was never there   20   edit  The Sisterhood Roughly around the same time  back on Earth in San Francisco the Red Queen and her Sisterhood attack the X Men  first trapping a sleeping Emma in a psychic barricade by Lady Mastermind  Inside what appears to be the White Hot Room or possibly just Emma s own mind  a woman resembling Jean Grey appears to Emma and helps her break free of Regan s influence with what appears to be a miniature version of the Phoenix energy raptor  thus letting her assist Logan  who has been robbed of a lock of Jean s hair that was in his possession  Madelyne uses the hair sample to locate Jean s gravesite  and then attempts to repeat a resurrection ritual with her corpse  but Cyclops had ordered Domino to substitute the body for someone elses and it somehow causes Madelyne to either discorporate or become absorbed into the fake  21   edit  Utopia During a conflict with several Predators X  genetically engineered mutant hunters   the Stepford Cuckoos are overwhelmed and knocked unconscious as the fragment of the Phoenix they captured forcefully escape from the girls  diamond hearts  much to the horror of Cyclops and the rest of the X Men  22   edit  Second Coming A promotional image for the event of Second Coming was released depicting two versions of Hope Summers  the so called Mutant Messiah   one angelic  emphasizing her role as a savior  the other as evil and surrounded by the Phoenix Force  depicting her as a destroyer  23  During the final confrontation with Bastion  Hope turns into what appears to be the Phoenix and blasts Bastion as Wolverine  Colossus  and Emma watch shocked  Bastion however manages to grasp Hope s neck  and states that despite his original programming  he will take great pleasure in killing her  Cyclops blasts his arm  and Wolverine jumps on him  as he tries killing him  for Kurt   Hope touches the ground again  saying she s ready now  going full Phoenix Force  blasted Bastion and the dome all at once  24  Later at a celebratory bonfire  Emma notices the flames around Hope take the shape of the Phoenix and Emma recalls the Sisterhood attack where Jean freed her from Lady Mastermind s illusion  25   edit  Generation Hope While fighting the fifth so called  Light   who was out of control  Hope attempts to take some of his powers only to exhausts herself and collapses  She is then contacted by the Phoenix Force who refers Hope as her  child  and that the other lights needed her  Hope then regains consciousness and went back to face Kenji Uedo  Due to Phoenix s words  it s implied that the five lights are all connected to the Phoenix Force  26   edit  Age of X The Age of X reality was created when Legion s mind reacted to Doctor Nemesis  attempt to restore its sanity  27  A new persona  with new powers  was born creating the new reality in order to protect Legion s many personalities  This new manifestation of Legion s power took the appearance of Moira MacTaggert  in order to confuse Xavier and protect Legion  In this reality Jean Grey s Phoenix Force ability manifested causing a tremendous amount of destruction and death in Albany  28  Though she was presumed deceased when the Air Force bombed the area  a new phoenix shape emerged from the rubble  29  Under the name of Revenant  it is not known whether she is Jean Grey  presumably dead after the Albany incident 28   or a totally new incarnation  She joins Magneto and became part of the Force Warriors  30  She also states she got lost on her way home and she does not look like herself  31  When the truth about the Age of X was finally revealed  Legion apologizes to everyone before rewriting the universe and putting everything back the way it was  However  Revenant who should not even exist is brought back to Utopia also  32  Later  as all mutants began to regain their true memories  Revenant is revealed to be actually the mind of Rachel Summers given human form  33   edit  Fear Itself During the Fear Itself storyline  the Phoenix Force appeared once again to Emma Frost  who s in Utopia s infirmary after she was overwhelmed by the cosmic powers of Juggernaut who had become the Worthy known as Kuurth  Breaker of Stone   The Phoenix soon began mocking Emma that Scott Summers would never love her as he loved Jean Grey revealing also that Jean had reborn and that Emma Frost already knows it  This Phoenix however seems to be a side effect of when Emma invaded Juggernaut s mind and began feeding into Emma s fears  As the Phoenix manages to convince Emma that Hope is Jean reincarnated  it tells Emma that she knows what to do  Emma  in a trance like state  takes her pillow and heads towards Hope  about to smother her to death  34   edit  Avengers vs  X Men It has been confirmed that the Phoenix Force will return in the upcoming 12 issue story arc Avengers vs  X Men  The event has the Phoenix Force returning to Earth to look for a new host in Hope Summers  the  Mutant Messiah   which will lead to a confrontation between the Avengers and the X Men on how to deal with its arrival  35  It has also been revealed that the Phoenix Force will be revealed to have a previously unknown connection with the Iron Fist legacy  citation needed   edit  List of hosts Jean Grey  The most powerful and complete Phoenix Force and Host combination  Together they have become the White Phoenix of the Crown  Death has stated that Jean is the rightful owner of the Phoenix Force  and that she is not just a host  she is the Phoenix and the Phoenix is her  Rook shir  A Shi ar that wielded the Phoenix Force through a giant blade  called the Blade of the Phoenix  He almost decimated the Shi ar Empire  Feron  Ancestor of the modern day Feron whose daydream like visions prompted the Phoenix to adopt the firebird form it has today  Necrom  Possessed a fraction of the Phoenix Force that would be later become known as the Anti Phoenix  Madelyne Pryor  A clone of Jean Grey that was brought to life by a fraction of the Phoenix Force  Rachel Summers  Jean Grey s daughter from an alternate timeline  Professor X  Charles Xavier briefly possessed a fraction of the Phoenix Force during his time with the Starjammers  Diamanda Nero  She briefly became the host of the Phoenix after her fight with Rachel  However  she was not truly able to contain the Phoenix  Prime was briefly possessed by the Phoenix Force while it was in the Malibu Universe Amber Hunt was possessed by the Phoenix Force while it was in the Malibu Universe  Emma Frost  Emma briefly became the host for Phoenix  However  she was not truly able to contain the Phoenix due to not having Omega level power  See X Men  Phoenix   Endsong  She does not consider herself a true avatar like Jean but rather a substitute for the wounded entity  Stepford Cuckoos  Possessed a fraction of the Phoenix Force that they had to imprison inside of their diamond hearts  See X Men  Phoenix   Warsong The Cuckoos lose their connection to the Phoenix fragment  as of Uncanny X Men  517  as it escapes their diamond hearts  leaving for parts unknown  Korvus  Descendant of Rook shir  Wielder of the Blade of the Phoenix  Currently the Blade is powerless after the connection to the Phoenix fragment was somehow lost  Other characters were only possessed by the Phoenix Force during out of continuity tales  This includes Nightcrawler  Storm and Gabriel Summers in separate What If    stories  as well as Cyclops in the X Men   Teen Titans inter company crossover  Quentin Quire was revealed to be a host in the Here Comes Tomorrow storyline in the visions of Deathlok  36  and in the timeline of Nocturne  the Phoenix Force possessed Colossus  soulless body and reshaped it into female form   edit  Powers and abilities The Phoenix Force has the ability to manipulate cosmic energies and to tap into the life force reserved for future generations  thus denying them existence  It can wield this energy to project beams of immense destructive force  It can transmigrate throughout time and space by folding its energy back into itself  causing it to collapse akin to a black hole and then reform itself upon reaching its destination  It can directly absorb energy such as Cyclops  optic blasts or even the entire energy of a sun  It is also capable of absorbing the energy and life force from a foe  As it is the nexus of all psionic energy  it has mental abilities of cosmic scope  including telepathy and telekinesis  The extent of the Phoenix Force s abilities has not been fully clarified  Jean Grey as The White Phoenix of the Crown was able to change the future of a universe by reaching back in time and pushing her husband Cyclops to move on with his life and held a universe in the palm of her hands  volume  amp  issue needed  Another major display of the power of the Phoenix was during the Secret Wars II  when the omnipotent Beyonder wanted to destroy all life  Rachel Summers  who served as the avatar of the Phoenix Force at that time  sought out to kill the Beyonder  The Beyonder expressed both amazement and disappointment to Rachel  claiming that she denies herself her own glory when she can be so much more  With that  the Beyonder gave Rachel the full access to the power of the Phoenix as well as some of his own  Rachel was on par with Jean Grey when she became Phoenix  With such power  Rachel was able to absorb the consciousness of every sentient mortal being in the universe  and when expelling the sum total of the power back at the Beyonder  the input felt overwhelming even to his senses  However  she was still stated as considerably below his level  that destroying the universe would not kill him  and simply not be lower than amoeba compared to him  volume  amp  issue needed  Often the Phoenix seeks out hosts who have strong inherent psionic abilities so they can withstand its power  When the Phoenix Force enters a host  a small fragment of its power is left behind when it leaves  Even a small fragment can be stronger than an inexperienced host using the Phoenix Force s powers  as seen by Rachel Summers  who had full access to the Force  but her opponent Necrom threw moons at her with only a fragment  volume  amp  issue needed  When bonded with a host  the Phoenix Force amplifies their abilities to incalculable levels  It can manipulate matter on a sub atomic level and transmute elements  e g   turning wood to gold  stone to crystal  etc    It can teleport others across space and can also open inter dimensional portals to instantaneously access distant locales of the Universe  If an avatar of the Phoenix Force is harmed or killed  it will form an  egg  of cosmic power  incubate in the White Hot Room  and hatch out completely healed  Also  as one of the oldest cosmic beings the Phoenix Force possesses a high level of cosmic awareness and prescience   edit  Other versions  edit  31st century Giraud  the 9th Phoenix  Main article  Phoenix  Guardians of the Galaxy  In the 31st century in the Guardians of the Galaxy comics series  ordinary human Giraud of New Haven becomes host to the Phoenix Force  As Phoenix  Giraud is a rarity for a Phoenix host  since he is an ordinary human with no magic or psionic abilities   only those powers granted him directly by the Phoenix Force  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Age of Apocalypse In the Age of Apocalypse reality  after Jean Grey s death at the hands of Havok  nuclear bombs set to destroy America were suddenly destroyed by a bird like display of fiery psionic power  It was Jean  awakened as the Phoenix  known as  Mutant Alpha   the legendary ultimate mutant   Sinister captured Phoenix  and brainwashed her into becoming one of his Sinister Six  He then turned Phoenix against the X Men  displaying the personality of Dark Phoenix  Phoenix generated so much heat that even Sunfire was nearly burned to death  but Psylocke used her psychic knife to bring her to her senses  Jean used the Phoenix Force to incinerate her former  master   and became leader of the X Men in Magneto s absence   edit  Amalgam Comics The Phoenix is combined with DC Comics character Kinetix to make Phoenetix in Spider Boy Team Up  1  37   edit  Earth X Though the origins and history of Phoenix of Earth 9997 match that of her Earth 616 counterpart  the following information has been revealed by both 3 D Man  Kyle Richmond  and the Watchman  X 51   The Phoenix Force was originally a citizen of the first universe that existed prior to the Big Bang that created the current universe in which Earth 9997 resides  This original universe collapsed due to the manipulations and reproduction of the Celestial race  There were a number of survivors who were referred to as  The Elders of the Universe   the Phoenix Force being one of these elders  It was later revealed that the Elders plotted to reunify the fragmented universe  and all its parallel universe and alternate history counterparts  through the Realm of the Dead and with the aid of Death  volume  amp  issue needed  The Phoenix Force was a part of this plot to reverse the damage the Celestials had already created  It was foreseen that eventually Death would be destroyed and that an Elder of the Universe would have to live in the Realm of the Dead in order to facilitate the collection of souls  which was at least one important step in reunifying the broken universe  As the Elders were all nearly immortal and could not die  the Phoenix Force had to bond itself to a being that would be capable of sacrificing itself for others  This being  was Jean Grey of the X Men  who during a mission in space was the lone pilot of a space shuttle traveling through a radiation storm while her comrades were in a shielded room  Unable to bond with the severely burned body of Jean Grey  it became a binary being with her  assuming her identity  personality and physical form and sealing her charred body in a cocoon to heal  When the shuttle crashed the cocoon remained at the bottom of Jamaica Bay  and the Phoenix Force took Jean s place  volume  amp  issue needed  Eventually the Phoenix sacrificed her life and the real Jean Grey returned  The Phoenix ended up in Death s realm  still in the guise of Jean Grey  and was one of the few beings in this realm that were aware that they were indeed dead  Citizens in the Realm of the Dead believe that they and those are around them are still alive  while others who are not present are deceased   She eventually joined up with Mar Vel s army to battle Death and her army  During this time  Scott Summers  new Mr  S  leader of the X Men  who was assisting Mar Vel in the land of the living  was able to establish a mental rapport with the Phoenix  although the real Jean Grey still lived on Earth 9997  Scott always referred to the Phoenix as  Jean   and kept him informed as to the goings on in the Realm of the Dead and  later  Mar Vel s Paradise  This soon became a great aid to Reed Richards and others who were trying to determine why the mortally wounded would no longer die following Death s death  volume  amp  issue needed  After the creation of Mar Vel s Paradise  Phoenix became one of the Avenging Host  a group of former champions who were transmogrified by technology once belonging to the High Evolutionary  They were to act as guardian angels to those in Paradise and help those in the Realm of the Dead realize that they were indeed dead so that they could travel over to Paradise and live out their perfect afterlife  During her time as one of the Avenging Host  its members began to doubt Mar Vel s intentions  believing that he was no aware that he had no idea what occurred outside Paradise  that as it grew it threatened to consume the Negative Zone  Their doubts in Mar Vel s quest were further strengthened when they began to realize that no new dead were appearing in Death s former realm  Phoenix would relay this information to Scott Summers  prompting the heroes of Earth 9997 to seek out Jude  the Entropic Man to become the new death  When Cap  3 D Man  Comet Man  Benny Becksley and Thanos learned that each  Paradise  created for the realms citizens were simply wish fulfillment  the Avenging Host aided in freeing each citizen from their private  heaven  and resolved to confront Mar Vel about his intentions  volume  amp  issue needed  The host  and Rick Jones  were all summoned and put on trial by Mar Vel  Confronted by Mar Vel with Captain America  Phoenix and the rest of the host were killed by their leader when Cap refused to take Mar Vel s power  Shortly after their death  the Kree army invaded Paradise and a large battle erupted  During the combat  Reed Richards arrived from the Negative Zone and confronted Mar Vel himself  During their talk  Mar Vel resurrected the Avenging Host to aid the citizens of Paradise defeat the Kree invaders  After the battles conclusion  Reed Richards being given the cosmic consciousness and Mar Vel leaving Paradise  Phoenix s current whereabouts are unknown  It is presumable that she remains in Paradise guarding those who have chosen to remain in this realm  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Legacy of Fire In a reality similar to the Marvel Mangaverse  the Phoenix Force is not just an entity  but a weapon  The Phoenix Sword as it was called was guarded and wielded by the sorceress Madelyne Pyre  who inherited the sword from her mother  When Madelyne s time as wielder of the sword was nearly up  she trained little sister Jena in the arts of fighting and magic  When their reality s version of Shadow King stole the Phoenix Sword  Jena tried to get it back  and Shadow King stabbed her with the sword  But in doing so  he inadvertently passed the powers of the Phoenix Sword to the dying Jena  who became the Phoenix Force s first host  She used the powers of Phoenix to vanquish Shadow King  and is now the guardian of her dimension  38   edit  Marvel Zombies Phoenix appears in the second Marvel Zombies mini series  The zombie survivors of the first series  who now possess the powers of Galactus  have been joined by other  cosmic level  zombies including an unnamed Dark Phoenix who appears to be Jean Grey  She is responsible  along with the others for eating most of the sentient life in the universe  A long trip back to earth and a delaying action fought by the last human colony leads to Jean and the others regaining their sense of morality and control over their own hunger  In fighting to defend the colony  Jean is destroyed by the hunger crazed Hulk  39   edit  Ultimate Marvel The Phoenix being attacked by its creations  In the Ultimate Universe  Jean Grey was placed in a mental institute after she began hearing voices and seeing visions of an omnipotent Phoenix God  After her release  she later thought she had contacted a celestial God entity which destroyed worlds  volume  amp  issue needed  As a result  the Hellfire Club believed that it would be in their best interests to summon the Phoenix and merge it with Jean Grey via a ritual  With Jean acting as the Phoenix Force s human avatar  she would be worshipped in a greater world  While the ritual was successful  the Phoenix had different plans and promptly slew the Hellfire Club  In the Ultimate X Men  Hellfire and Brimstone arc  the Phoenix Force makes its first appearance as the entity personality within Jean s body  volume  amp  issue needed  Subsequently  Jean managed to gain some control over Phoenix  though not without using dangerous amounts of its power and causing extreme destruction  In the process  she telekinetically lifted a mass of land and atomized it  destroyed a helicopter and ten men within  created a giant Phoenix Raptor  and subdued a woman named Spiral  volume  amp  issue needed  Charles Xavier was confronted by Lilandra Neramani  the leader of a religious group known as the Church of Shi Ar Enlightenment  who worship a God known as the Phoenix  Lilandra claims that the Phoenix God is the force that created life itself  first creating the stars  planets  as well as everything else in the universe  Many millennia later  the Phoenix created life forms on those planets and watched them grow and prosper  However  as time went by  the civilizations grew more advanced and sophisticated  and soon became jealous of the Phoenix  They wanted its raw  unimaginable  and limitless power for themselves  Soon after  the inhabitants of the planets waged war upon the Phoenix  trying to control it  as well as its power  They amassed a great army  bringing together a hundred civilizations  But the Phoenix fought strongly for thousands of years until the life forms found a way to imprison it since it could not be killed  But as conventional methods could not imprison it  they created vortex to suck in the asteroids and planets around it  creating a spherical cage  but at a cost the Phoenix would be trapped in it forever  As the millennia went by  the Phoenix Force s cage began to evolve  oceans formed  mountains rose  plants grew and life forms began to sprout upon it  Soon those life forms evolved into humans and the cage in which the Phoenix resided became known as Earth  The Shi Ar Church believed that the Phoenix was the very core of the planet  volume  amp  issue needed  As a result of their meeting  Lilandra asks for permission to study Jean Grey to determine whether or not she truly is the embodiment of the Phoenix Force  During the examination  the Phoenix entity apparently asserts itself in an evil form but is seemingly suppressed by Professor Xavier s more experienced psychic powers and his emotional outreach to Jean Grey s normal personality  volume  amp  issue needed  After the suppression of what seems to be the Phoenix Force  Lilandra and Charles are informed by Gerald  Lilandra s assistant  that Jean s test has proven to be negative  Gerald also reveals that Jean Grey s parents have a connection to the Shi Ar Church and postulates that Jean s subconscious has manifested a false Phoenix persona after being subjected to Phoenix Force stories in her youth  Feeling that she has lost her mind Jean slips into a depressed state and begins seeing green creatures latched on to her body  However  it is then revealed to the reader that Jean has actually tested positive as the carrier of the Phoenix

a funeral  this version of Angel carries Jean s corpse into the sky  where 1602 Cyclops tearfully burns her to ashes with his eye beams  The fire briefly formed a shape similar to the Phoenix before vanishing  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  What If  The timeline shown in What If v2   79 diverged from the main reality on the fateful day when the X Men s shuttle passed through cosmic radiation during re entry to Earth  Jean Grey had been knocked out and could no longer pilot anymore  So it was Storm who volunteered to steer the capsule with her elemental powers  However  she was not as successful as Jean  and all of the X Men  except for Wolverine  died during the crash  Storm seemingly survived and emerged from the wreckage as Stormphoenix  now displaying absolute control over all aspects of the weather  She erected a benevolent dictatorship on Earth  drawing young mutants to her side and freezing the super beings who opposed her in the atmosphere  As she grew more cruel and detached from humanity  the remaining heroes as well as her acolyte  Kitty  and her mentor  Ahadi hatched a plan to get rid of her  They examined the space capsule and found the real Storm  who had been placed in a healing cocoon and submerged in the Hudson Bay  Kitty took over her body and they confronted Stormphoenix as the fake she was  Shocked back to its senses  the Phoenix left Earth  but the real Storm died in the process  The What If Special for X Men  Rise and Fall of the Shi Ar Empire looks at what would have happened if Vulcan had inherited the powers of Phoenix via the M Kraan Crystal  In this reality it was Vulcan who ended up inside the M Kraan Crystal  instead of Professor X  Through the M Kraan Crystal  Vulcan ascends to the White Hot Room where he meets the Phoenix Corps  one of them being Kid Omega  who says that Vulcan does not belong there  Vulcan takes Kid Omega s powers  He slays all the Phoenix Corps taking all their powers along  He goes out of the Crystal and takes the pieces of the Phoenix Force out of Rachel and Korvus  Wielding supposedly the full Phoenix Force  he soon destroys the Shi Ar Empire  Xavier  Nightcrawler  Polaris  Warpath  Darwin  the Starjammers  Gladiator and Lilandra  Only Rachel and Havok survive  because they escape through a teleportation portal that mysteriously appears next to them  They are not sure who or what caused a stargate to seemingly open  Then Vulcan destroys 1 3 of the Annihilation Wave along with Annhilius himself  Nova pleas to Ronan the Accuser to escape  However  like he did to the Shi Ar Empire  Vulcan destroys the Kree Empire  The Watchers comment  that the Phoenix  consumed  a galaxy  it was the 7th galaxy to fall  Rachel and Havok arrived at Earth and with Cyclops and Cable engage Vulcan  The match takes place in the island that was torn to pieces  Krakoa  however  apparently wielding the Phoenix Force holds no limits to what it can do as Krakoa is now alive and intact  However  as the battle erupts Vulcan begins to lose control  Rachel warns Gabriel  that the Phoenix Force reacts poorly to negative emotions  The consequences of losing total control will not only consume himself but the entire reality  Finally letting go of the rage and hate he holds  he proceeds to halt his rampage  and accept his death  Then all the actions are revealed  It is none other than Jean Grey who is the White Phoenix of the Crown  It was Jean that opened the teleportation portal so Rachel and Havok could escape to Earth  she also shows Gabriel that wielding the ultimate power will not give him what he truly wanted  being loved  After his death  Vulcan is shown as a child once again  and he goes to the White Hot Room where he s comforted by Jean  She jokingly tells him that she always had a soft spot for Summers men  Note  All the actions are narrated by the M Kraan Crystal s guardian Jhaf   edit  Crossovers Phoenix has appeared in the following intercompany crossovers  Dark Phoenix teamed up with Darkseid in the Teen Titans X Men crossover between DC and Marvel Comics  respective teams  The story was made by Chris Claremont  Walt Simonson and Terry Austin in 1983  The story follows Darkseid conversing with Metron for the Anti Life Equation at the edge of the Universe  Metron and Darkseid make a deal  and Dark Phoenix becomes part of that equation  The Teen Titans try to stop Darkseid  with the help of the X Men  who later go head to head with Deathstroke the Terminator  The Dark Phoenix breaks free from Darkseid s grasp  is briefly hosted by Cyclops  and eventually dies again  The team up is generally considered non canonical by fans  With good reason  as unless stated otherwise by the companies themselves  inter company crossovers generally take place outside of the normal continuity  volume  amp  issue needed  The Phoenix Force was transported to the Ultraverse where it possessed the pyrokinetic ultra Amber Hunt  The X Men  Ultraforce  Exiles  and numerous other characters team up to stop the Phoenix from destroying the world  40   edit  In other media  edit  Television The Phoenix displaying its power via Jean Grey in X Men animated series  The entire saga of the Phoenix is retold and adapted in the third season of the X Men animated series  subdivided into the five part  Phoenix Saga   in which Jean acquires the power of the Phoenix and the battle for the M Kraan Crystal occurs  and the  Dark Phoenix Saga   showcasing the battle with the Hellfire Club  the Phoenix Force s transformation into Dark Phoenix  and the battle to decide her fate  These particular episodes are as close as the cartoon came to directly duplicating the comic book storylines   the  Dark Phoenix Saga  is so accurate to the original stories that the episodes have the additional credit   Based on stories by Chris Claremont    Notably  however  as the Phoenix Force retcon had occurred before the creation of the series  the episodes were made with this change in mind   rather than having Jean develop her powers independently  as was the original intent of the comics   or be replaced by the cosmic Phoenix Force entity  as events were later retconned   the two concepts were merged  into Jean s actual body being possessed by the Phoenix Force  leading to a true struggle between two independent entities  Jean is shown piloting a shuttle  and when her telekenetic shield fails Phoenix enters her body  Rather than destroying an inhabited system   which was the cause for the decision to kill off the character in the comics   the animated story had her destroy a deserted system and only disable the attacking Shi Ar cruiser  These changes made it possible for aspects of the original ending of Uncanny X Men  137  in which Jean survives  to be used  Jean does still commit suicide  taking control of the Shi Ar s laser beam to fire on herself  rather than finding an ancient weapon   but with her death  the Phoenix Force is purified  and then uses its powers to resurrect Jean  drawing on the combined life force of the assembled X Men to bring her back to life  Jean retained her original basic powers  whereas in the aborted comic book ending  she would have been lobotomized by the Shi Ar and lost them entirely  She was voiced by Catherine Disher  citation needed  The Phoenix Force makes a cameo in the last episode of X Men  Evolution  During a confrontation with Professor X  now a Horsemen of Apocalypse  the Phoenix briefly forms from the shield Jean made during their psychic battle  Following Apocalypse s defeat  her other cameo is part of Professor Xavier s glimpse of the future  and shows Jean Grey screaming out as she becomes the Phoenix  41  The Phoenix makes an appearance in Wolverine and the X Men  vague  In this series  the Phoenix Force is an entity that has afflicted psychic mutants since the Homo Superior race first appeared  It enters the host at birth  growing with it  Once it reaches maturity  the Phoenix Force takes over its host  going on to cause mass destruction  42  It is revealed that it is Jean who causes the explosion as she transforms into The Phoenix  Initially Emma original intent was to use the Stepford Cuckoos to lure the Phoenix out of Jean  body to prevent any damage  However the Hellfire Club revealed their intention to take the power for themselves  Betrayed  Frost  Jean and Cyclops fight the Phoenix and Emma seemingly sacrifices herself to stop it by absorbing the Phoenix into her body  turning to diamond then shattering into pieces  Without a host  the Phoenix Force Vanishes  edit  Films Famke Janssen plays Jean Grey in three movies  beginning with X Men  During the film  Jean uses Cerebro for the first time  which causes strain on her mind and abilities  Later  she is affected by Magneto s machine which enhances the mutant gene in humans  In the second film  X2  X Men United  Jean Grey s powers have been evolving since the Liberty Island incident in the first movie  As Jean Grey uses her powers  a fiery aura appears in her eyes  In the climax of the movie  she is engulfed in a fiery aura as she holds back a tsunami of water from a burst dam to save the other X Men  In the final scene  a giant flying fiery bird can be seen reflected in the water  In the third X Men movie  X Men  The Last Stand  Jean  becomes  Dark Phoenix  Jean is the only known class five mutant  At a young age  Xavier locked some of Jean s powers away as she could not control her near infinite abilities  This causes a split in Jean s psyche between Jean Grey and the Phoenix  what her split personality calls itself  and drives her to insanity  During the movie  Jean and the Phoenix battle for dominance  Jean tells Wolverine she thinks she killed Scott  although this is never confirmed  Phoenix destroys Xavier and joins Magneto  Jean Phoenix abstains from a battle on Alcatraz until the military reinforcements show up and try to shoot her  Phoenix then gains full control and in her fury demolishes the island  ripping it and everything on it apart on the molecular level  Wolverine climbs his way to Jean s side while his flesh is peeled from his Adamantium covered bones  his healing factor being the only thing keeping him alive  He calls to Jean  but there is only the Phoenix and it shows contempt for his actions  Logan tells Jean that he would only die for her and that he loves her  His heartfelt words pull Jean to the fore  she asks him to save her  He stabs her with his claws  killing her and ending the destruction  Jean s tombstone lies on the X Mansion ground  beside the markers of Scott and Xavier   edit  Video games Jean Grey appears as  Phoenix  in the X Men  Mutant Academy games for the Sony PlayStation under the codename Phoenix and also as  Dark Phoenix  in X Men  Next Dimension  Jean Grey also appears as a playable character in X Men Legends  and even wears the green and yellow gold Phoenix costume in one or more of the levels  In X Men Legends II  Rise of Apocalypse  Jean Grey  who is a playable character  has some attacks related to the Phoenix Force  such as the ability to resurrect another character during game play  and the player can also select for her both the original and Dark Phoenix costumes  In addition to Jean Grey  the PlayStation Portable version of this game also includes the Dark Phoenix separately as an unlockable bonus character  Her attacks are mainly related to the Phoenix Force itself  and is arguably the most powerful playable character in the game  In Marvel  Ultimate Alliance  the Dark Phoenix made an appearance in the ending of the game if the player chooses to save Nightcrawler instead of saving Jean in Mephisto s realm  Since Jean Grey does not die in the Infinity Vortex  she will return to Earth in the form of the Dark Phoenix to take vengeance upon those who did not save her  In Spider Man 2  Enter Electro  a costume called Spider Phoenix represents Spider Man as host of the Phoenix Force  though Spider Man cannot use Phoenix s powers in game  In Marvel  Ultimate Alliance 2  Jean Grey is playable  and has her Phoenix costume as her primary outfit  Two of her 4 power attacks take base from the Phoenix  resulting in fire mixing with telekinesis  and a massive fire blast  Jean Grey appears as  Phoenix  as a playable character in the crossover fighting game Marvel vs Capcom 3  Fate of Two Worlds  She has the ability to resurrect herself as the Dark Phoenix   edit  References   Dark Phoenix is number 9   IGN   X Men Vol  1  101
