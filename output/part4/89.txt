or commit suicide     Domino src  Early Years Not too much is known about Deadpool s childhood  Sometime after his mother died from cancer  his father was killed by a drunken friend  and he was kicked out of the United States Army Special Forces   Wade  joined Project X  1   Little was known of Wilson s subsequent mercenary activities  At one point he was active in Tangier  Morocco where he romanced a woman named Francie  When this relationship soured  he traveled throughout Asia  and was hired in Japan by a crime lord  the Boss  to infiltrate a sumo wrestling ring owned by a rival criminal  the Oyakata  Wilson spent three years as a wrestler under the Oyakata s tutelage and became romantically involved with his mentor s daughter  Sazae  When the Boss finally ordered the Oyakata s murder  Wilson refused to complete his assignment  allegedly the first time he had ever done so  and relocated to the United States  2  In America  Wilson met and fell in love with mutant teenage prostitute Vanessa Carlysle  with whom he shared dreams of a better life  Wilson was subsequently hired by Middle Eastern interests to assassinate a blind British government operative named Althea  also known as Blind Al  but upon arrival at the Zaire base where she was stationed  he killed everyone except for Al who had fled  Wilson s employers sought vengeance for his failure by targeting Vanessa  who was rescued by Zoe Culloden  an employee of the inter dimensional firm Landau  Luckman  Lake  and LeQuare  Culloden was keeping Wilson under surveillance  believing he was destined to play a vital part in a potential threat to the world  Learning that he had contracted cancer  Wilson broke up with his girlfriend Vanessa rather than force her to remain with a terminally ill man  He even gave up his chemo treatments  not wishing to prolong things  Weapon X In Canada  he was offered hope in the form of Department K  a special weapons development branch of the Canadian government  Wilson became a test subject in Department K s branch of the joint U S  Canadian superhuman enhancement project  the Weapon X Program  his cancer was temporarily arrested via the implantation of a healing factor derived from another Department K agent  the mutant adventurer Wolverine  Wilson was active in a covert field unit alongside the near invulnerable Sluggo and the cyborgs Kane and Slayback  Vanessa herself was later affiliated with the team after having manifested mutant shapeshifting abilities  calling herself Copycat  During one mission  Wilson killed his teammate Slayback  As a result  he was rejected from the Weapon X Program and sent to the Hospice  allegedly a government facility where failed superhuman operatives were treated  However  unknown to the Canadian government  the Hospice s patients served as experimental subjects for Doctor Killebrew and his sadistic assistant Ajax  known then as The Attendant   with the patients placing bets in a  deadpool  as to how long each subject would live  Killebrew subjected Wilson to various torturous experiments for his own deranged satisfaction  In due course  Wilson formed a romantic relationship with the cosmic entity Death  who regarded him as a kindred spirit  Wilson started trying to kill himself  to join Death   going so far as to start taunting Ajax by saying his real name  Francis  over and over  which earned him the respect of his fellow Hospice patients  Then Ajax  angered by Wilson s taunts  lobotomized Worm  the closest thing Wilson had to a friend  At Death s prompting  Wilson killed Worm to end his suffering  However  under Killebrew s rules any patient who killed another was to be executed  Ajax subsequently tore out Wilson s heart and left him for dead  but Wilson s thirst for vengeance was so strong that it jump started his healing factor  regenerating his heart  although not curing his scarred body  Wilson then escaped the now empty room and attacked the guards  making his way to Ajax  Wilson shot him in the chest with two automatic rifles  leaving him for dead  Taking the name Deadpool  he escaped from the Hospice with his fellow patients  Deadpool and Copycat in Deadpool   The Circle Chase  04 Added by Copycat989 Mercenary Following his escape  Deadpool served for a time as an enforcer alongside the surgically altered criminal Hammerhead  He soon returned to his freelance mercenary activities  donning a costume in keeping with his new identity  At some point during his mercenary career he was employed as an assassin by Wilson Fisk  the Kingpin of crime  He also clashed with Wolverine  at that time a spy for the Canadian government  At some point during these years  Deadpool caught up with Blind Al and kept her a prisoner in his home  Al s attempts to escape only resulted in death for those whose help she sought  leaving her no choice but to resign herself to captivity  Some years after escaping the Hospice  Deadpool  perhaps seeking compensation for the injuries inflicted upon him by Killebrew  returned to the Canadian government and was treated by Doctor Walter Langkowski  the bestial Sasquatch of Canada s super team Alpha Flight  He also acquired a teleportation device around this time  Deadpool soon found government work unsuited to his temperament  and he abandoned this endeavor  Hired by the criminal genius known as the Wizard  Deadpool at first went to the wrong address and received a job impersonating the criminal Hobgoblin  When again contacted by The Wizard  he joined with fellow criminals the Taskmaster and the Constrictor  Frank Schlichting  in a short lived version of the Frightful Four  When this plan also failed  Deadpool sought to reclaim his position as the Kingpin s assassin  only to be challenged by fellow assassin Bullseye  Deadpool began frequenting the mercenary hangout called the Hellhouse  where the diminutive Patch issued assignments  There he routinely clashed with T Ray  a voodoo sorcerer and assassin of whom he maintained a constant dislike  He found employment with the time traveling arms merchant Tolliver  in whose service he was reunited with Sluggo and Copycat  Unbeknown to Deadpool  Tolliver subsequently sent Copycat to impersonate another mutant mercenary  Domino  Deadpool also recruited a man named Weasel to act as his weapon supplier  and the two became fast friends  despite numerous acts of violence against him  After some time in Tolliver s service  Deadpool was sent to kill Cable  the mutant soldier from the future who was in fact Tolliver s father and in whose company Copycat was impersonating Domino  However  Deadpool met defeat at the hands of Cable and his new charges  the young mutants in training known as the New Mutants 3   When Cable reorganized the New Mutants as X Force  Tolliver was seemingly slain in battle with them  setting off a search by his various mercenaries for the advanced technology he had left behind  Deadpool s participation in the search was interrupted by the surprising interference of Slayback  who had cybernetically reconstituted himself after being slain by Deadpool and was eager for revenge  In the course of the ensuing battle  Copycat was gravely injured  and Deadpool sacrificed part of his healing ability to save her life 4   Deadpool helped X Force member Siryn against the Juggernaut and her uncle  Black Tom Cassidy  who had forced Killebrew into their service  Deadpool developed a strong attachment to Siryn  who only partially returned his feelings  The Genesis Coalition hired Deadpool to capture Silver Sable   a mission that also threw him into battle against Daredevil  whom was then no longer going by his real identity  He took the fight to the sewers where he was  convinced  to hand over the information regarding his mission  for triple his commission  He was also put on retainer  in case he thought about choosing to take a mission against Sable s interests again  Unsure of his worthiness  Deadpool sought out Copycat  only to find she was now dating Kane  Deadpool fought both Kane and Wolverine  who had been sent to check on Kane by a mutual friend  Deadpool was subsequently abducted by information brokers seeking a cure for the Legacy Virus but was rescued by Wolverine and the mutant mercenary Maverick  Mithras Deadpool was approached by Zoe Culloden of the rechristened Landau  Luckman  amp  Lake who believed he was destined to be the Mithras  one who would help usher in a golden age for Earth  Skeptical  Deadpool turned Zoe away  only to be hit with a string of personal failures  These included the alienation of Weasel and Blind Al  whom had been meeting  against Deadpool s instructions   a defeat at the hands of T Ray and loss of good grace at Hellhouse  He met up with Bullseye to do a pro bono job in Greece  where the assassin told him that he was losing his edge   as shown by the fact he only wounded the people he was supposed to be killing  Deadpool disputed the fact  even going as far as to accuse the now dead guards of moving the castle he was supposed to blow up with a sheep rocket  when he hit the tower instead  Bullseye told Deadpool that he wouldn t kill him for one reason   he made him laugh  At this point  it was revealed that they had worked together before  in the Army   where Bullseye nearly lost his pinky toe because they were laughing so much on a mission  Hoping to turn over a new leaf  he found that killing was not so easily left behind when  at the behest of the ghosts of his fellow former Weapon X inmates  he killed Ajax  The former Attendant had been tracking down and killing them all  one by one  mainly wanting to kill Deadpool  This was possible partly due to the help of Dr Killbrew  who lost his life to Ajax  Before he was remotely kidnapped by his teleportation belt and Ajax  he told Blind Al that she was now free  After being employed by L  L  amp  Lake  he was hired to be part of a Heroes for Hire mission  much to the annoyance of Colleen  Misty Knight  Luke Cage and Iron Fist  When he found that he would have to climb a mountain to their castle destination   and that HFH lacked a flier   he teleported up instead  He was immediately seen at the top  losing the essence of surprise  The HFH attacked  finding an iteration of Wild Pack waiting for them  After the rest of Heroes for Hire were defeated  Deadpool teleported to safety  Later Deadpool located and freed Misty and Colleen from the room they were being held in by Madcap  bringing their weapons to them as well  When asked where he concealed them  he replied with  Do you reeeeally want to know  It involves an awful lot of lubricant   Deadpool and the girls then met up with Luke Cage who turned out to be working toward an alternate agenda  Claiming he could smell a traitor when he saw one  Deadpool opened fire  Cage managed to escape minutes later  Deadpool acknowledges his existence in a comic book  Added by Arijos0222 Continued Mercenary Life Having lost his optimism toward being able to better himself  Deadpool returned to his mercenary life  Troubled by recent events  he sought the counsel of deranged psychiatrist Doctor Bong  who advised him to work out his difficulties in a fight with Wolverine  The fight indeed cleared Deadpool s mind  but his psyche was dealt a stunning blow by the resurrection of Mercedes Wilson whom Deadpool still believed to be his wife  T Ray revealed himself not only as the one responsible for her resurrection  but also as the  true  Wade Wilson  The revelation did not break Deadpool s spirit as T Ray had hoped  for the mercenary still harbored hopes of bettering himself  Swearing vengeance  T Ray departed with Mercedes Wilson  In the course of an assassination assignment against author Duncan Vess  Deadpool again clashed with Wolverine who had sensed something strange about Vess  The pair found themselves battling Vess  vengeful kinsmen after the author was revealed to be a werewolf  and they parted on good terms  Weeks later  Deadpool would be forced to capture Wolverine in exchange for medical treatment for Siryn  who had been injured in a mission with X Force  Siryn was cured  and Wolverine easily outfought his captors  Seeking a new place for himself  Deadpool briefly shared an apartment with fellow mercenaries Titania and the Constrictor  However  Titania proved to be Copycat in disguise  and the apartment was destroyed by the The Wizard and the Taskmaster  both seeking revenge on Deadpool  He then established a secret warehouse headquarters and took on a young sidekick who called himself Kid Deadpool  Chris Cassera   Sadly the youth was also seeking vengeance against Deadpool for his part in Cassera s father s death  and blew up the warehouse  Deadpool  unlike most characters  is aware that he is in a comic book and able to express his thoughts via captions  Added by Arijos0222 Deadpool was tracked down by Sabretooth and invited to join a new Weapon X Program  Impressed by Weapon X s upgrade to his healing factor  he agreed to join  but soon found the organization s methods to be too bloody  even for him 5   After the death of Copycat at the hands of Sabretooth  he confronted the Director  only to have his healing factor reversed to the point where he again lost physical cohesion and died  The lingering effects of Deadpool s healing factor upgrade resurrected him  leaving him an amnesiac  A chance encounter with Weasel later restored his memory  and he discovered that four other individuals had laid claim to the Deadpool name in his absence  These impostors were aspects of his own personality given form by a device called the Gemini Star  wielded by T Ray  who had been hired by the intergalactic villain Thanos  Thanos himself was enamored of Death and became jealous of Deadpool s relationship with her  T Ray intended to use the Gemini Star to manifest and extinguish every aspect of Deadpool s personality  leaving him an empty shell  however Deadpool damaged the device  causing his personality fragments to be absorbed into T Ray and render Ray comatose  With T Ray out of the way  Deadpool claimed his identity as the true Wade Wilson once again  Agent X Following an assignment to kill the Four Winds crime family  Deadpool gained prominent status as a mercenary and formed a company called DP  Inc   aided by business partner Sandi Brandenberg  His success was short lived  however  when the Black Swan  a fellow assassin who had actually slain the Four Winds himself  sought vengeance for Deadpool s wrongful claim  Both men were believed dead after an explosive confrontation  but the Swan s telepathic power caused the memories and skills of both himself and Deadpool to merge into the corpse of his underling Nijo  Deadpool s healing factor resurrected Nijo  whose mind was created from an amalgam of Deadpool and the Swan  Injured and an amnesiac  Nijo found his way to Sandi s apartment  Sandi believed Nijo to be Deadpool and nursed him back to health  The man took the name Alex Hayden and together they started  Agency X   with Hayden dubbed Agent X after the company  Most believed that Hayden was Deadpool with a case of amnesia  The truth was discovered when the Black Swan showed up with a  tabula rasa  Deadpool in tow  who Hayden immediately shot in the head  Deadpool s own personality was slowly growing back  unwittingly accelerated by Hayden s bullet to his head  You and Wilson have my skills  Mr Hayden  In return  I received a taste for Radiohead and an encyclopedic knowledge of pornographic knock knock jokes  Yes  I d like to switch back if possible    Black Swan In an attempt to regain the parts of his mind he had lost  as well as remove the pieces of their minds he wanted rid of  Swan proposed a three way mind meld  Hayden agreed  however the Swan  being an evil cad  attempted to double cross the others and kill them as soon as the process was complete  but while he concentrated on Hayden  Deadpool stabbed him in the back  Deadpool  Hayden and Hayden s allies Outlaw and Taskmaster had The Swan stuffed so that the healing factor couldn t resurrect him   Hayden would later use the corpse as a surfboard  6   With Cable Both Deadpool and Cable became involved with a terrorist plot aimed at unleashing the shape shifting  Fa ade Virus  upon the world  Both were infected with the virus  with merging their DNA structures being the only way they could survive  As a result  each man had some of the other s DNA sequences within them  From then on  whenever Cable used his teleporter to  bodyslide   both he and Deadpool teleported together    sometimes literally  a  bodyslide by one  resulted in them being badly integrated into a single body  forcing a messy separation  which  thanks to the DNA shared with Wade  Cable was also able to recover from   An additional result of the Fa ade Virus in his system was that Deadpool s skin was temporarily cured of the hideous tumor scarring  This result was corrected when Cable shut down all infections of the virus worldwide  Cable  amp  Deadpool Added by Artful Dodger Cable was achieving the peak of his abilities  seeking to become a world leader ushering a new era of peace  Cyclops worried about his son  and hired Wade to find and assemble pieces of a teleporter meant to stop Cable if it came to that  In an attempt to unite the world  Cable deliberately set the world s leaders against him  by threatening to throw their missiles into the sun  Deadpool and the X Men mounted their attack on Providence  whereupon Deadpool promptly turned on the X Men  siding with Cable  Cable confessed to wanting to become a martyr  to show the governments that they could achieve something by working together  In an attack by the Silver Surfer  Cable burnt out his powers and narrowly escaped death when Deadpool removed the telepathic and telekinetic parts of his brain via mini teleporter  Cable was badly injured  and Wade then set out to recover some techno organic matter to replace the damage  Deadpool encountered Agent X and the Fixer during his mission and was ultimately successful  which sadly left him unemployed thereafter  Cable felt guilty for Deadpool s status as a renegade mercenary being corrupted by his heroism  and began to covertly hire him for missions  without revealing that he was the one doing so  Deadpool would later rescue Cable again  teleporting through several alternate worlds to retrieve him when he became lost 7   Cable returned the favor by repairing Deadpool s brain damage before his powers burnt out once more  leaving his personality and powers unchanged  As the super hero registration act  HR421  came into law  Deadpool decided to try and get hired to be a S H I E L D  licensed bounty hunter  hunting down super powered individuals to get them to register with S H I E L D  His initial attempts were unsuccessful  but he was hired nonetheless  being ordered by the president to hunt Cable  Wade was unsuccessful 8   Trying to fix his again damaged reputation  Deadpool kidnapped Taskmaster and forced him to fight to convince four Government higher ups  who were also kidnapped  to hire him again  Deadpool won the fight  but wasn t hired  being cited as too immature 9   Deadpool awoke days later to find that he had been shrunk with Pym Particles by Weasel  who was attempting to help Wade take on the Rhino  Deadpool tried  and was instead made into a key chain and taken to the Three Strikes Bar  where he was humiliated repeatedly  After being flushed down a toilet  Deadpool managed to return and beat up each and every one of them  including Rhino   whilst still only a few inches high 10   Agent X was captured by Hydra  and Deadpool was approached by Agency X to find and rescue him  Still only inches tall  Deadpool went with Weasel to the Hydra base in Afghanistan  where they met Bob  Agent of Hydra  and used him to free Agent X  who had been turned into a 500 pound slob by Hydra s Morphogenetic Actuator   Deadpool was changed back to normal size in the process and was asked to take over Agency X whilst Nijo got back into shape  Deadpool and Agent X Added by Artful Dodger Returning to Agency X  they found that Outlaw and Sandi had been taken hostage by T Ray  Deadpool was almost killed when he attempted to save the girls but instead stabbed T Ray in the head with a katana   forged by the same guy who made the one on Heroes   1   Providence was attacked by the Hetacomb  and Deadpool came to help  He arrived too late to fight the alien  but was able to help Cable to fight off the Marauders  In the end  Deadpool realized Cable wouldn t trust him with important tasks  and was sent home alone while Cable seemingly perished with Providence  Deadpool went to Rumekistan to pay his final respects to Cable  and while he was there  was asked to stop Wolverine from destroying a Hydra base  Minutes before Wolverine found Weasel at the base  Wade found him in a teleportation capable suit  calling himself the  Penetraitor   Quickly decapitating Deadpool  Wolverine began to kill the Hydra agents  leaving ones that were strapped into suits similar to the Penetraitor s  They activated the suits to escape  but disappeared  Weasel explained that they were rigged to send the users to Guantanamo Bay  and Bob was able to reattach Deadpool s head  Bob  Weasel  and Wade returned to Rumekistan to finish paying their final respects  when Deadpool and Bob disappeared in a flash of light due to the now damaged suit Weasel wore 11   They appeared in Europe  circa World War II  where they encountered Captain America and Bucky  aiding them in their quest to defeat Arnim Zola and his creations  Time slips created problems during the trip  and Cap and Bucky once forgot who Bob and Deadpool were  attacking them  The time slips were created by Weasel s efforts to return them to the present  Eventually two teams of the Fantastic Four were able to return them to the present 12   Deadpool went on several missions for Dr Strange  patching the mystical hole he created in T Ray s head by stabbing other mystical creatures with the same sword  The final act to seal the rift was to find T Ray s soul and bring him back to life  Wade reluctantly set out to do so  seeking help from Brother Voodoo along the way  T Ray was eventually returned to life  and both realized they needed each other 13   Upon returning to Agency X headquarters  Irene Merryweather came asking for aid in locating a energy generator for Rumekistan which was based in the Savage Land  When arriving  the team encountered a mind controlled Ka Zar  and had to fight the forces of Brainchild  During the conflict  Deadpool accidentally used Weasel s Penitraitor technology to warp some dinosaurs to the Latverian embassy in New York  So upon defeating Brain Child they had to return to New York to help the Avengers return the dinosaurs  who happened to be infected with symbiotes at the time   Deadpool saved the day by absorbing the consciousness of the symbiotes and killing himself  albeit briefly  14   Despite being hailed as something of a hero after the stunt with the symbiotes  Deadpool slipped easily back into his old ways when attempted to kill Wolverine  For once  Deadpool planned every stage of the attack  orchestrating a series of hits that came close to killing both of them  Just before Wolverine was to be drowned  Daken interfered  cutting off Wade s hands so that he could kill his father himself  Daken was shot with a carbonadium bullet by Bucky Barnes  who had originally hired Deadpool  The entire hit was planned by Wolverine so that he could capture his son  so Deadpool received no money 15   Deadpool fighting a Super Skrull Added by Artful Dodger Secret Invasion When the Skrull invasion began  Wade was held captive  and trained Skrulls to embrace insanity so as to better handle his abilities  He escaped when the Skrulls turned on one another and transmitted stolen intel to Nick Fury  Wilson s real plan   which was intercepted by Norman Osborn  who lead the Avengers and HAMMER  Since Fury never received the data  Wilson went unpaid for his efforts 16   After months of unemployment  Colonel Zeke hired him to kill Doctor Druek Lovosno  who had kidnapped Zeke s wife  Deadpool found that Doctor Lovosno had found a way to preserve youth  amp  beauty indefinitely  but they had to devour human flesh to do so  Wade was captured  meant to be a renewable source of food for the young zombies  Luckily he tasted terrible  so he was released after promising them the alternative of Zeke and his mercenaries  and blew up the castle they were in during the firefight 17   Dark Reign Deadpool and Bob  Agent of Hydra Added by Artful Dodger With no money left after the third unpaid job in a row  Deadpool had to steal away on a freighter bound for America  Mid Atlantic  the ship was sunk by Tiger Shark tearing through the hull  He awoke on a beach in Mexico  missing an arm and with his costume in tatters  and planned to kill Tiger Shark while he recovered  Tiger Shark found him first  and tried to kill him with an oversized machete  The resulting fight brought the Mexican police  who shot and seemingly killed Wade while Tiger Shark escaped  He woke up to find himself in a body bag on a pier  which he felt was a nice change from waking up in a body bag in the morgue  Tiger Shark came out the water and attacked again when Bob appeared with his gun blazing  Tiger Shark dives back into the water  and after a couple hours of waiting for him to resurface  Bob and Deadpool retire to a motel  There  Bob reveals that he was sent to kill Deadpool  same as Tiger Shark  who was on his way to the room   Wade manages to shoot Tiger Shark through the motel window and interrogate Bob for the name of his employer  Norman Osborn  Norman was aware that the intel Wade unwillingly provided was the only reason he was put into a position of power  and wanted Deadpool eliminated to secure his position  Wade had no idea who Norman was 18   Wilson traveled back to New York with the idea that Osborn should have paid him for that intel  and attempted to break into the Avengers tower  Osborn had been ready for him with a trap  and sent the Thunderbolts to intercept him  Deadpool managed to disable all of the Thunderbolts with the exception of Black Widow  who he began to fall for  While professing his love  he was shot by Paladin and escaped  He teleported to the Taskmaster s  Unoccupied office building  where he regrouped and got the bullets out of his body whilst telling  Tasky  about how much he adored Black Widow and his plan for two Deadpools 19   Hiring a plane to fly a banner professing his love for  BW  as well as his phone number  Taskmaster was able to pinpoint the call made to that number to find the Thunderbolt s headquarters  The Thunderbolts used the call to find Taskmaster s position as well  believing him to be Deadpool  As they left to intercept him  Deadpool called their number and flirted with Widow while he shot at them from the plane  Crashing the plane and losing that phone  he teleported back to Taskmaster to get a new phone before teleporting directly to her  since she wasn t with her team  While fighting and kissing her  he managed to ask Taskmaster  dressed as Deadpool  to stall her team while he spent time with her  After losing Rock Paper Scissors  Deadpool had to instead take care of the Thunderbolts while Taskmaster went after Black Widow  Taskmaster was captured by her  and was about to have his head cut off by Headsman when Wade rescued him  Osborn wanted to see Deadpool killed  and was in attendance when Taskmaster was about to have his head chopped  so Deadpool went after him after releasing Taskmaster  Wade nearly had Osborn when Black Widow shot him through the heart  enabling Headsman to cut off his head 20   After recovering  Deadpool thanked Taskmaster for his help by paying him via ATM using Osborn s wallet  Taskmaster claimed he didn t put Wade s head back on  and Deadpool believed it was Widow s way of telling him she loved him back  He would later pop up behind Osborn during a national television appearance holding a sign that said   Respawn lol  20   Out of work yet again  Wade posted his services on Craigslist  He was hired to kill a pizza boy for making fun of a girl in childhood  Wade managed to shoot him  then stealing all of the homeowner s possessions in the house he had broken into to order the pizza  While checking out the TV  he saw a news story where he was denounced as a traitor to the human race for joining the Skrulls  When he went to get the keys to the car in the garage  he was greeted by Hawkeye  really Bullseye  and eventually gets shot in the head with an arrow  Planning to grind him up so that he can t regenerate  Lester underestimated Wade s healing factor  and was surprised when Deadpool attacked  When Deadpool won the fight  Bullseye paid him to never tell anyone else 21   Wade used his new found riches to buy a pirate boat  and as a short and very unsuccessful stint as a pirate  decided to become a hero instead 22   Deadpool    X Men    Added by Black Diesel He made his way to Utopia to become an X Man  and they quickly rejected him  Since they couldn t just let him go  they pretended to bring him in on a probationary membership under the watch of Domino  Deadpool tried to get in the X Men s good graces by killing Mark Kincaid  who had been claiming that the X Men had kidnapped his daughter and were holding her against her will  part of Norman Osborn s plot to weaken the X Men   When his plan began to fall apart  Osborn instead tried to use the situation to further discredit the X Men by killing Kincaid and blaming Deadpool  who had publicly and falsely claimed X Men membership   but Deadpool had set everything up to make the X Men heroes again in the eyes of the public  This allowed the X Men to reluctantly give Wade full membership 23   Secret Avengers Deadpool decides to continue his efforts to try to be a hero and goes to Las Vegas where he meets up with his old friend Weasel and steals his job as The House  a robotic hero Weasel had created  He would expose the casino he works for as crooks and leave much  much richer  Later  he finds himself in a standoff between armed hit men  all with Healing factors  and an Arab arms dealer  Deadpool quickly kills them all with the help of what appear to be the Secret Avengers who ask him to be on the team  What Deadpool doesn t know is these are actually clones of the team created by Dr  Bong  Then the real Steve Rogers and his Secret Avengers show up  Deadpool fights and almost kills the real Steve Rogers  Later Deadpool winds up teaming up with the real Secret Avengers to take Dr  Bong s operation down with a last display of fireworks  Move along Green Lantern  here s the Deadpool Corps  Added by Moshikal15 Deadpool Corps Deadpool was recruited by an entity known as The Contemplator to save the multiverse  To do this he would have to assemble a team of alternate universe Deadpools  He visited a string of universes where his alternates were significantly different from him  recruiting Lady Deadpool  Kidpool  Dogpool  and Headpool along the way  With his team assembled  he revealed his plan to save the multiverse to them 24  25   Deadpool s X Force costume  Added by Scion of Balance X Force Deadpool joined Wolverine and Archangel s X Force team to proactively eliminate threats to the mutant race with the only rule being that no one  not even the X Men  could ever know that they exist 26   After one of their first missions  which ended with the team killing Apocalypse  who was reincarnated as an innocent child  Deadpool called a meeting to discuss his moral doubts about killing a child  During this meeting  Archangel told Wolverine that  despite being employed by Archangel for over a year  Deadpool never cashed any of the checks for his services 27   Later  in the Deathlock team up  X force is taken into the Deathlock world to look for the origin of the mind controlled army  There is also some bad tension between Deadpool and Fantomex  which leads to them going different ways  Deadpool ends up being the one to kill the world Father by cutting his head off then putting a sword through it to show the rest of the team  Fantomex is surprised  and they leave in silence  Fear Itself Allow me to introduce myself  My name s Deadpool  and I m a    traveling walrus tamer  I takes the wild and nasty walruses  ya see  and I beats their faces in till they re tame    Deadpool src  During the invasion of the Serpent and his Worthy  Deadpool attempted to cash in on the fear that was running rampant throughout the world  To this end  he stole a magic hammer belonging to a pair of werewolf hunters  and then gave it to the dimwitted Walrus  convincing the hapless mort that he d been chosen to serve as one of the Worthy  His plan was to send the Walrus rampaging through the town of Cimarron  New Mexico  and then show up and  rescue  the town and collect a hefty fee  The hammer  however  proved to have the ability to negate Deadpool s healing factor during a full moon  and what should have been an easy fight proved nearly fatal  Initially  he tried to run away  but was confronted by the werewolf hunters  who informed him that the hammer was needed to stop an impending attack by a pack of werewolves  Convinced of the necessity of retrieving the hammer  Deadpool returned to town  and tricked the Walrus into entering the sheriff s office  thus taking it out of the light of the full moon and deactivating its powers  He then promptly shot the Walrus in the shoulder  took back the hammer  and effectively saved the town  though he found to his dismay that the town s cache of Confederate gold had long ago been stolen  and thus they could not pay him  Deadpool in space  Added by ADour The best there is After defeating the intergalactic mercenary  Macho Gomez  Deadpool went in a space oddesy where he saved two entrie planets and killed Id  the Selfish Moon of Ego  After he came back to Earth  he fought the vengeful Blind Al  Weasel  Taskmaster  Big Bertha and Sluggo  under the leadership of Macho  After a drawn out fight and killing Sluggo  Wade paused and asked his so thought friends  Is this what you want    After which they proceeded to shoot him until unconsciousness  Thanks to his healing factor  Deadpool recovered  After talking with Bob about how he treats his friends  Wade realizes what he truly wants is to die  Deadpool in Crossmore Added by ADour Institutionalized Unsuccesfully commiting suicide and battling the Hulk  Wade is sent to the english prison of Crossmore  where he meets doctor Ellen Whitby  who had been secretly obssessed with him for several years  Out of a one sided love  she helped him escape  Despite this  Wade rejects her for being completely insane  After leaving he is encounters the local law enforcement which inadvertantly leads to Wade taking the Queen of England hostage  After having a talk with the Queen  she convinces Deadpool that Whitby is his responsability  After going to her apartment  he finds many of his own severed body parts in the fridge  After confronting Whitby she kills herself  and Wade throws the frozen body parts in a dumpster and leaves  Afterward  the parts thaw and heal together to form an even more deformed and very sadistic clone of Deadpool  Battling Evil Deadpool Added by ADour Evil Deadpool Both Deadpools manage to get to New Jersey on their own  Wade met Evil Deadpool at his favourite chimichanga restaurant  which Evil Deadpool blew up  After a long fight and running out of bullets  the Deadpools agree to meet and fight at Canarsie Park  After another fight and another explosion  Evil Deadpool escapes while Wade is confronted by Captain America and then escapes  Meanwhile  Evil Deadpool goes to Mister Negative to ask him for a job  murdering a police chief s children   After careful contemplation of Evil Deadpool s next move  he decides that his motivation must be to one up the orginal Deadpool  After some planning  Wade proceeds to publicly kidnap a random child in hope that this would draw out Evil Deadpool  However  Evil Deadpool had already predicted this and kidnaps the police chief s children and sends a message to the parents that he had done so  leading to the chief to believe the real Deadpool had kidnapped his children   and then takes out Captain Amreica who had been watching Wade  and knew that Wade was never anywhere near those children   After Cap recovers and Interpol becomes involved  Cap informs the chief that Deadpool couldn t have kidnapped his children and so all are led to believe he has an accomplice  After some time passes  Wade realizes that he has been played  frees the child and escapes  Using a teleportation device  Evil Deadpool lures the police chief and Deadpool into a trap to make it appear that Deadpool had killed the chief and his children  this fails however and the chief escapes with his children  Evil Deadpool then explains to Wade that his motivations were to show him that no matter what good he accomplishes people will only ever see him as a monster  Just then  Captain America and the police arrive at the scene and tell both to stand down  Evil Deadpool raises his weapon at them and is shot down in a hail of bullets  After he is down  it is seen that he was hit with a special dart that none of the police claim to have fired  and all of Evil Deadpool s scars fade until he appears a regular human and dies  After witnessing that there is a way to kill him  Wade steals Evil Deadpool s teleportation device and escapes  Search for death Wilson starts a plan to get that serum which neutralises mutant powers  so he can finally be with his beloved Death  To do this  he manipulates X Force  Kingpin and The Hand  Daken and Tombstone  the last one manages to get to a scientist who finally makes the cure using a hair of Wilson from his baby book  meanwhile X Force battles the Hand  Powers and AbilitiesEdit Powers Regenerative Healing Factor  Deadpool possesses a superhuman healing factor derived from that of the mutant Wolverine that allows him to regenerate damaged or destroyed bodily tissue with far greater speed and efficiency than an ordinary human  Deadpool is able to heal injuries such as slashes  puncture wounds  bullet wounds  and severe burns within moments  His healing factor is significantly more powerful than Wolverines as he can regrow missing limbs and organs and has survived blades through his brain on several occasions  His head or any other limb can be reattached using this ability  but has to be placed in the proper place 28   As Deadpool had cancer at the time of the gene therapy which endowed him with these abilities  it bound to the  healing factor  so that in a sense the cancer is his healing factor  which is why his skin is still horribly scarred  Unlike Wolverine s natural healing factor  Deadpool s is mentally driven to a partial extent  Foreign Chemical Resistance  Deadpool s body is highly resistant to most drugs and toxins  For example  it is extremely difficult  though not impossible  for him to become intoxicated  Blind Al made several references to Deadpool being hung over since he once drunkenly spoke to the Telletubbies on the TV he was watching   He can  however  be affected by certain drugs  such as tranquilizers  if he is exposed to a large enough dosage  Disease Immunity  The unique regenerative qualities of Deadpool s healing factor also extend to his immune system  rendering him immune to the effects of all known diseases and infections  Extended Longevity  Deadpool s healing factor provides him with an extended lifespan by slowing the effects of the aging process to an unknown degree  His life span is extended to such a degree  that an alternate reality version of him was alive and still in business as Deadpool 800 years in the future 29   Deadpool has established a relationship with the personification of Death and as a result has been cursed by Thanos  to be unable to die  Added by Zetta666 Telepathic Immunity  The healing factor causes his brain cells to be in a constant state of flux and regeneration  rendering him immune to psychics such as Professor X and Emma Frost  Recently Deadpool has not demonstrated this ability  He was able to be telepathically linked to the rest of the X Force team by Psylocke and has fallen under mind control of Shadow King  Peak human Strength  Deadpool possesses great  though not unnatural  physical strength  However  he does have at least the strength of an Olympic level weightlifter  He is capable of lifting at least 420 lbs  but no more than 800 lbs  Superhuman Stamina  Deadpool s musculature generates considerably less fatigue toxins than the muscles of an ordinary human being  granting him superhuman levels of stamina in all physical activities  He can physically exert himself at peak capacity for several days fatigue begins to impair him  Superhuman Agility  Deadpool s agility  balance  and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete  Superhuman Reflexes  His reflexes are similarly enhanced  superior to those of even the finest human athlete  Power Grids Official Ratings 30  Intelligence  2 Strength 4  Speed  7   2 Durability 4  Energy Projection  1 Fighting Skills 6    Teleporter Fan Ratings Intelligence  2

combat techniques  He has been shown fighting such amazingly skilled fighters as Wolverine and Taskmaster and even defeating them in hand to hand combat 31   This shows that Deadpool himself is among the most skilled fighters in the Marvel universe  Master Assassin  He is a master of assassination techniques  espionage methods  covert operations  infiltration methods  escape artistry  marksmanship  and is highly skilled with many bladed weapons  frequently carrying two swords strapped to his back   and a number of other weapons including firearms  Skilled Linguist  He is fluent in Japanese citation needed   German citation needed   Spanish citation needed   Russian citation needed   Pashto citation needed   Urdu citation needed  amongst other languages citation needed   Medium Awareness  Possibly as a result of his mental state  he is aware that he is fictional and in a comic book Strength level Deadpool possesses great  though not unnatural  physical strength  He does possesses the strength of an Olympic level weightlifter  While the exact amount of weight he can lift isn t known  he is able to lift at least 420 lbs  but no more than 800 lbs Weaknesses Deformity  Deadpool s artificial healing factor accelerated his cancer  resulting in his freakishly scarred face  Mental state  His healing abilities render his brain unreadable to telepaths  but its constant healing of it also makes him highly unstable and prone to violent outbursts without the slightest provocation  at least against those he knows could handle them  Annoying  Wade s mental state has also proven to make him a very irritating person to be around  Many heroes often find themselves at wits  end around him  this makes for poor ability to cooperate with him in team efforts  ParaphernaliaEdit Equipment Deadpool has utilized different teleportation devices to whisk him out of  and occasionally into  danger  as well as a holographic image inducer that he can use to disguise his true appearance as necessary  Transportation Teleportation Device  Deadpool was able to  bodyslide  to where ever Cable is present  through Providence  At different periods Deadpool has possessed different teleportation technologies  Weapons Deadpool employs any number of weapons depending on his current assignment  Most often  Deadpool uses guns  grenades  sai  knives  and katanas  Wade can use any weapon known to man and learn how to use the weapon in less than 5 minutes  Wade is mainly seen using a gun  Deadpool has also been shown as having a magic satchel  often pulling weapons out of nowhere  citation needed  TriviaEdit Deadpool became one of the villains sent to find the so called Identity Disc possessed by AIM 32   Wade was hired at one point to assist the local resistance in Rumekistan against Flag Smasher and Citizen V  Deadpool has friends  such as Weasel and Blind Al that he was loyal to and cared about  Due to his insanity  he would mistreat them at times  such as stabbing Weasel in the leg over the last Cheesy Puff or confining Blind Al in a room filled with sharp objects  After becoming temporarily merged with Cable  Wade seemed to be immune to Cable s telepathy despite Cable s psionic powers becoming greatly increased  The Healing Factor causes his brain cells to be in a constant state of flux and regeneration  rendering him immune to psychics  This constant flux is not what causes him to have his witty banter and ADD type personality   That s just the way I am  bitch   as Deadpool once put it  Deadpool and his brain  Added by Deadpool2325 Deadpool commonly develops obsessions with words and people  repeatedly mentioning the words duodenum and chimichanga  the phrase  Sphincter says what    and is frequently preoccupied by thoughts of Bea Arthur  Ernest Borgnine  and the Olsen Twins  A recurring gag of his is when he calls guns  doorknobs   While holding a pair of guns in his hands  he spoke a famous line   Doorknobs don t kill people  I kill people   According to the villainous Taskmaster  whose abilities allowed him to analyze and copy the mercenary s fighting style  Deadpool always dodges to the left  Deadpool was cursed for a short time by Loki  who had claimed to be his father  the curse made him look like Tom Cruise  rendered his face totally invulnerable  and his life to  fall to ruin   The curse was removed when Deadpool reconciled with his true father  who he met in a bar without ever realizing who it was  This seems to contradict an issue of  Cable  amp  Deadpool  when a conversation between Cable and Deadpool about their pasts and parents  Deadpool s father is shown dying when he was a teenager  however when questioned on the truth of the story by Cable  Deadpool responds   I ll tell you the truth when you tell me   Deadpool s speech and thought balloons and captions are usually colored yellow  to represent his distinctive voice  although nobody knows exactly what is distinctive about his voice  only that it sounds different   Cable of Earth 5701 has described his voice as having a  gravelly  Demi Moore  quality before  killing  him  Blind Al has also stated that Deadpool s voice sounds like a distinct mixture of  gasoline and gravel   In his earliest appearances  his speech balloons were normal balloons with red borders  soon changed to yellow borders   in later appearances  the interior would be colored yellow and the text would be written in a slightly mangled font  Deadpool is one of the few Marvel comic book characters that have broken the  fourth wall  and called attention to his nature as a comic book character  During Deadpool s adventure to save the multiverse from the Awareness his worst fear was revealed to be truly and utterly alone  Deadpool s name IS Wade Wilson  as that s the name he used to sign up with the army  However due to both T Ray and Deadpool being insane  neither s word can actually be trusted  In Deadpool s words  It depends on which writer you liked best   The X Man Gambit has such respect for Deadpool s fighting abilities that he once paid him off rather than risk battling him  admitting that fighting Deadpool is tantamount to suicide  Domino once said that Deadpool s most lethal weapon is his mouth  He will blabber nonsense during the whole fight  distracting and maiming the opponent until the latter  surrenders or commits suicide   Deadpool and Deathstroke  Added by Mrblonde267 Deadpool clearly bares a lot of unmistakable similarities to Deathstroke  Deadpool commonly uses the name  Wade Wilson   similar to  Slade Wilson   Deathstroke from the antimatter universe appears and has similar characteristics related to Deadpool  such as Deadpool s  merc with a mouth  wisecracks  a black spot on his mask over his eye somewhat resembling Deadpool s  the two wear nearly identical costumes  although they have completely opposite attitudes  While this character didn t seem to be as skilled at fighting as Deathstroke  his healing factor seemed far more effective  with Slade becoming annoyed at how hard he was to kill   This character tries to introduce his name multiple times but is always interrupted  The most he was able to get out was  Dea    It could be implied Deadpool is the Marvel counterpart of Deathstroke  who was created 11 years earlier  Marvel seemingly acknowledged this in the Cable Deadpool series  where Deadpool sometimes answers a letters column  Deadpool claimed that he didn t want to be in a Marvel DC crossover  because people might mistake him for a certain DC character  The two of them actually met during a Mr  Mxyzptlk influenced crossover event  in which the two of them fought with conflicting contracts to both kill and save Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne  Cows  scare the      outta  him believing they re stare to be chilling   waiting   He may also be scared of chickens  just like Domino is  this could have been an attempt to find common ground with her though 33   Deadpool has stated that due to his mask and disfigured face it is hard for him to enter public places  One place he stated is Taco Bell  Appearances in Other MediaEdit Deadpool in Hulk Vs Deadpool in X Men
