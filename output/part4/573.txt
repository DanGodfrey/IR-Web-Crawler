The United States Coast Guard  USCG  is a branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven U S  uniformed services  The Coast Guard is a maritime  military  multi mission service unique among the US military branches for having a maritime law enforcement mission  with jurisdiction in both domestic and international waters  and a federal regulatory agency mission as part of its mission set  It operates under the Department of Homeland Security during peacetime  and can be transferred to the Department of the Navy by the President at any time  or by Congress during time of war  Founded by Alexander Hamilton as the Revenue Cutter Service on 4 August 1790  it is the United States  oldest continuous seagoing service  As of August 2009 update  the Coast Guard had approximately 42 000 men and women on active duty  7 500 reservists  30 000 auxiliarists  and 7 700 full time civilian employees  4  The Coast Guard s legal authority differs from the other four armed services  it operates simultaneously under Title 10 of the United States Code and its other organic authorities  e g   Titles 6  14  19  33  46  etc  Because of its legal authority  the Coast Guard can conduct military operations under the Department of Defense or directly for the President in accordance with Title 14 USC 1 3  The Coast Guard s enduring roles are maritime safety  security  and stewardship  To carry out those roles the Coast Guard has eleven statutory missions as defined in 6 U S C    468  which include enforcing US law in the world s largest exclusive economic zone of 3 4 million square miles  5  The Coast Guard motto is Semper Paratus  Latin for  Always Ready  or  Always Prepared    Contents 1 Mission 1 1 Role 1 2 Missions 1 2 1 Non homeland security missions 1 2 2

protection  MEP   and the maintenance of river  intracoastal and offshore aids to navigation  ATON   While most military services are either at war or training for war  the Coast Guard is deployed every day  With a decentralized organization and much responsibility placed on even the most junior personnel  the Coast Guard is frequently lauded for its quick responsiveness and adaptability in a broad range of emergencies  In a 2005 article in Time magazine following Hurricane Katrina  the author wrote   the Coast Guard s most valuable contribution to  a military effort when catastrophe hits  may be as a model of flexibility  and most of all  spirit   Wil Milam  a rescue swimmer from Alaska told the magazine   In the Navy  it was all about the mission  Practicing for war  training for war  In the Coast Guard  it was  take care of our people and the mission will take care of itself   6   edit  Missions A Coast Guard rescue swimmer assisting with the rescue of a pregnant woman during

Search and Rescue Committee See Joint Rescue Coordination Centers While not the oldest  search and rescue  SAR  is one of the Coast Guard s best known missions  The National Search and Rescue Plan 8  designates the Coast Guard as the federal agency responsible for maritime SAR operations  and the United States Air Force as the federal agency responsible for inland SAR  Both agencies maintain rescue coordination centers to coordinate this effort  and have responsibility for both military and civilian search and rescue   edit  National Response Center Operated by the Coast Guard  the National Response Center  NRC  is the sole U S  Government point of contact for reporting all oil  chemical  radiological  biological  and etiological discharges into the environment anywhere in the United States and its territories  In addition to gathering and distributing spill data for Federal On Scene Coordinators and serving as the communications and operations center for the National Response Team  the NRC maintains agreements with a variety of federal entities to make additional notifications regarding incidents meeting established trigger criteria  The NRC also takes Terrorist Suspicious Activity Reports and Maritime Security Breach Reports  Details on the NRC organization and specific responsibilities can be found in the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan  9 The Marine Information for Safety and Law Enforcement  MISLE  database system is managed and used by the United States Coast Guard  USCG for tracking pollution and safety incidents

defined in 10 U S C    101 a  4   The term  armed forces  means the Army  Navy  Air Force  Marine Corps  and Coast Guard  The Coast Guard is further defined by 14 U S C    1  The Coast Guard as established 28 January 1915  shall be a military service and a branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times  The Coast Guard shall be a service in the Department of Homeland Security  except when operating as a service in the Navy  Coast Guard organization and operation is as set forth in Title 33 of the Code of Federal Regulations  On 25 February 2003  the Coast Guard was placed under the Department of Homeland Security  The Coast Guard reports directly to the Secretary of Homeland Security  However  under 14 U S C    3 as amended by section 211 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006  upon the declaration of war and when Congress so directs in the declaration  or when the President directs  the Coast Guard operates under the Department of Defense as a service in the Department of the Navy  As members of the military  Coast Guardsmen on active and reserve service are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice and receive the same pay and allowances as members of the same pay grades in the other uniformed services  The service has participated in every major U S  conflict from 1790 through today  including landing troops on D Day and on the Pacific Islands in World War II  in extensive patrols and shore bombardment during the Vietnam War  and multiple roles in Operation Iraqi Freedom  Maritime interception operations  coastal security  transportation security  and law enforcement detachments have been its major roles in recent conflicts in Iraq  On 17 October 2007  the Coast Guard joined with the U S  Navy and U S  Marine Corps to adopt a new maritime strategy called A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower that raised the notion of prevention of war to the same philosophical level as the conduct of war  10  This new strategy charted a course for the Navy  Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent regional crises  manmade or natural  from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impacts to the United States  During the launch of the new U S  maritime strategy at the International Seapower Symposium at the U S  Naval War College in 2007  Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Thad Allen said the new maritime strategy reinforced the time honored missions the service has carried out in the United States since 1790   It reinforces the Coast Guard maritime strategy of safety  security and stewardship  and it reflects not only the global reach of our maritime services but the need to integrate and synchronize and act with our coalition and international partners to not only win wars     but to prevent wars   Allen said  10   edit  Authority as a law enforcement agency USCG helicopter firing warning shots at smugglers in a boat  2  14 U S C    2 authorizes the Coast Guard to enforce federal law  This authority is further defined in 14 U S C    89  which gives law enforcement powers to all Coast Guard commissioned officers  warrant officers  and petty officers  Unlike the other branches of the United States Armed Forces  which are prevented from acting in a law enforcement capacity by the Posse Comitatus Act and Department of Defense policy  under 18 U S C    1385 the Coast Guard is exempt from and not subject to the restrictions of the Posse Comitatus Act  Further law enforcement authority is given by 14 U S C    143 and 19 U S C    1401  which empower U S  Coast Guard active and reserve commissioned officers  warrant officers  and petty officers as federal customs officers  This places them under 19 U S C    1589a  which grants customs officers general law enforcement authority  including the authority to   1  carry a firearm   2  execute and serve any order  warrant  subpoena  summons  or other process issued under the authority of the United States   3  make an arrest without a warrant for any offense against the United States committed in the officer s presence or for a felony  cognizable under the laws of the United States committed outside the officer s presence if the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing a felony  and  4  perform any other law enforcement duty that the Secretary of Homeland Security may designate  The U S  Government Accountability Office Report to the House of Representatives  Committee on the Judiciary on its 2006 Survey of Federal Civilian Law Enforcement Functions and Authorities  identified the U S  Coast Guard as one of 104 federal components that employed law enforcement officers  11  The report also included a summary table of the authorities of the U S  Coast Guard s 192 special agents and 3 780 maritime law enforcement boarding officers  12  Coast Guardsmen have the legal authority to carry their service issued firearms on and off base  This is rarely done in practice  however  at many Coast Guard stations  commanders prefer to have all service issued weapons in armories  Still  one court has held that Coast Guard boarding officers are qualified law enforcement officers authorized to carry personal firearms off duty for self defense  13   edit  History Main article  History of the United States Coast Guard Marines holding a sign thanking the U S  Coast Guard after the battle of Guam  The roots of the Coast Guard lie in the United States Revenue Cutter Service established by Alexander Hamilton under the Department of the Treasury on 4 August 1790  The first Coast Guard station was in Newburyport  Massachusetts  Until the re establishment of the United States Navy in 1798  the Revenue Cutter Service was the only naval force of the early United States  It was established to collect taxes from a brand new nation of patriot smugglers  When the officers were out at sea  they were told to crack down on piracy  while they were at it  they might as well rescue anyone in distress  14   First Fleet  is a term occasionally used as an informal reference to the U S  Coast Guard  although there is no indication that the United States has ever officially used this designation with reference either to the Coast Guard or any element of the U S  Navy  The informal appellation honors the fact that between 1790 and 1798  there was no United States Navy and the cutters which were the predecessor of the U S  Coast Guard were the only warships protecting the coast  trade  and maritime interests of the new republic  15  The modern Coast Guard can be said to date to 1915  when the Revenue Cutter Service merged with the United States Life Saving Service and Congress formalized the existence of the new organization  In 1939  the U S  Lighthouse Service was brought under its purview  In 1942  the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation was transferred to the Coast Guard  In 1967  the Coast Guard moved from the Department of the Treasury to the newly formed Department of Transportation  an arrangement that lasted until it was placed under the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 as part of legislation designed to more efficiently protect American interests following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001  In times of war  the Coast Guard or individual components of it can operate as a service of the Department of the Navy  This arrangement has a broad historical basis  as the Guard has been involved in wars as diverse as the War of 1812  the Mexican American War  and the American Civil War  in which the cutter Harriet Lane fired the first naval shots attempting to relieve besieged Fort Sumter  The last time the Coast Guard operated as a whole within the Navy was in World War II  More often  military and combat units within the Coast Guard will operate under Navy or joint operational control while other Coast Guard units will remain under the Department of Homeland Security   edit  Organization Main article  Organization of the United States Coast Guard The current headquarters of the Coast Guard is at 2100 Second Street  SW  in Washington  D C  near Nationals Park  where it will continue to have a presence at least into 2015  16  The new Department of Homeland Security headquarters complex is being built on the grounds of the former St  Elizabeths Hospital in the Anacostia section of Southeast Washington  across the Anacostia River from the current Coast Guard headquarters  As part of this consolidation  the Coast Guard will be the first DHS agency to locate its headquarters in the new complex  estimated to occur in late 2013 or early 2014  17   edit  Shore establishments Shore establishment commands exist to support the mission of the seaborne or airborne fleets through the use of facilities on land  The headquarters is in Washington DC  Other shore establishments are Coast Guard Stations  Coast Guard Air Stations  Aids to Navigation Stations and the United States Coast Guard Yard  Training centers include the United States Coast Guard Academy  Training Center Petaluma  Training Center Cape May and Training Center Yorktown   edit  Personnel The formal name for a uniformed member of the Coast Guard is  Coast Guardsman   irrespective of gender   Coastie  is an informal term commonly used to refer to current or former Coast Guard personnel   Team Coast Guard  refers to the four components of the Coast Guard as a whole  Regular  Reserve  Auxiliary  and Coast Guard civilian employees  In 2008  the term  Guardian  was introduced  but is being phased out of use  Sailor is a term used for the sea going members of the Coast Guard  Admiral Papp stated that it was his belief that no Commandant had the authority to change what members of the Coast Guard are called as the term Coast Guardsman is found in Title 14 of the USC  which in 1915 established the Coast Guard  18   edit  Commissioned Officers Commissioned officers in the Coast Guard have pay grades ranging from O 1 to O 10  with O 10 being the highest and use the same rank structure as the Navy  Officers holding the rank of Ensign  O 1  through Lieutenant Commander  O 4  are considered junior officers  Commanders  O 5  and Captains  O 6  are considered senior officers  and Rear Admirals  O 7  through Admiral  O 10  are considered flag officers  The Commandant is the only member of the Coast Guard to hold the rank of Admiral  19  The Coast Guard does not have medical officers or chaplains  Instead  U S  Navy chaplains and U S  Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officers are assigned to the Coast Guard to perform these functions  These officers wear Coast Guard uniforms but replace the Coast Guard insignia with that of their own service  20  Commissioned Officer grade structure of the United States Coast Guard Admiral  ADM  Vice Admiral

are considered Petty Officers and follow career development paths very similar to those of U S  Navy petty officers  Coast Guard Petty Officers  however  tend to have far more responsibilities within a rate than their Navy counterparts  and many US Coast Guard rates encompass several individual US Navy rates  specialties  into one Coast Guard rate  This is due to the Coast Guard s low numbers and highly selective enlistment requirements when compared with the other services  Petty officers in pay grade E 7 and higher are named Chief Petty Officers and must attend the Coast Guard Chief Petty

Guard Women s Reserve created on 23 November 1942 with the signing of Public Law 773 by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt  24  The name is a contraction of the Coast Guard motto Semper Paratus and its English translation   Always Ready   The name also refers to a spar in nautical usage  Like the other women s reserves such as the Women s Army Corps and the WAVES  it was created to free men from stateside service in order to fight overseas  Its first director was Captain Dorothy C  Stratton and she is credited with creating the name for the organization  The cutter USCGC Spar is named after the SPARS  25   edit  Training  edit  Officer training The United States Coast Guard Academy is a four year service academy located in New London  Connecticut  Approximately 225 cadets graduate each year  receiving a Bachelor of Science degree and a commission as an Ensign in the Coast Guard  Graduates are obligated to serve a minimum of five years on active duty  Most graduates are assigned to duty aboard Coast Guard cutters immediately after graduation  either as Deck Watch Officers  DWOs  or as Engineer Officers in Training  EOITs   Smaller numbers are assigned directly to flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola  Florida or to shore duty at Coast Guard Sectors  Districts  or Area headquarters units  In addition to the Academy  prospective officers  who already hold a college degree  may enter the Coast Guard through Officer Candidate School  OCS   also located at the Coast Guard Academy  OCS is a rigorous seventeen week course of instruction which prepares candidates to serve effectively as officers in the Coast Guard  In addition to indoctrinating students into a military lifestyle  OCS provides a wide range of highly technical information necessary for performing the duties of a Coast Guard officer  Graduates of OCS are usually commissioned as Ensigns  but some with advanced graduate degrees may enter as Lieutenants  junior grade  or Lieutenants  Graduating OCS officers entering Active Duty are required to serve a minimum of three years  while graduating Reserve officers are required to serve four years  Graduates may be assigned to a cutter  flight training  a staff job  or an operations ashore billet  OCS is the primary channel through which the USCG enlisted grades ascend to the commissioned officer corps  Lawyers  engineers  intelligence officers  military aviators  graduates of maritime academies  and certain other individuals may also receive an officer s commission through the Direct Commission Officer  DCO  program  Depending on the specific program and the background of the individual  the course is three  four or five weeks long  The first week of the five week course is an indoctrination week  The DCO program is designed to commission officers with highly specialized professional training or certain kinds of previous military experience  Unlike the other military services  the Coast Guard does not have a Reserve Officers  Training Corps  ROTC  program   edit  Recruit training Newly enlisted personnel are sent to eight weeks of recruit training at Coast Guard Training Center Cape May in Cape May  New Jersey  New recruits arrive at Sexton Hall and remain there for three days of initial processing which includes haircuts  shots  uniform issue  and other necessary entrance procedures  During this initial processing period  the new recruits are led by temporary Company Commanders  These temporary Company Commanders are tasked with teaching the new recruits how to march and preparing them to enter into their designated  Company   The temporary Company Commanders typically do not enforce any physical activity such as push ups or crunches  When the initial processing is complete  the new  Seaman Recruits  are introduced to their permanent Company Commanders who will remain with them until the end of training  There is typically a designated  Lead  Company Commander and two support Company Commanders  The balance of the eight week boot camp is spent in learning teamwork and developing physical skills  An introduction of how the Coast Guard operates with special emphasis on the Coast Guard s Core Values is an important part of the training  The current nine Recruit Training Objectives are  Self discipline Military skills Marksmanship Vocational skills and academics Military bearing Physical fitness and wellness Water survival and swim qualifications Esprit de corps Core values  Honor  Respect  and Devotion to Duty   edit  Service schools Following graduation from recruit

ethical conduct and moral behavior in all of our personal actions  We are loyal and accountable to the public trust  Respect  We value our diverse workforce  We treat each other with fairness  dignity

responsibility  accept accountability  and are committed to the successful achievement of our organizational goals  We exist to serve  We serve with pride  40   edit  The Guardian Ethos In 2008  the Coast Guard introduced the Guardian Ethos  As the Commandant  Admiral Allen noted in a message to all members of the Coast Guard    T he Ethos     defines the essence of the Coast Guard and could be viewed as the contract the Coast Guard and its members make with the nation and its citizens  41  The Ethos is as follows  I am America s Maritime Guardian  I serve the citizens of the United States  I will protect them  I will defend them  I will save them  I am their Shield  For them I am Semper Paratus  I live the Coast Guard Core Values  I am a Guardian  We are the United States Coast Guard   edit  The Coast Guard Ethos In an ALCOAST message effective 1 December 2011 the Commandant  Admiral Papp  directed that the language of Guardian Ethos be superseded by the Coast Guard Ethos in an effort to use terminology that would help with the identity of personnel serving in the Coast Guard  The term Coast Guardsman is the correct form of address used in 14USC and is the form that has been used historically  I am a Coast Guardsman  I serve the people of the United States  I will protect them  I will defend them  I will save them  I am their shield  For them I am Semper Paratus  I live the Coast Guard core values  I am proud to be a Coast Guardsman  We are the United States Coast Guard  42   edit  Creed of the United States Coast Guardsman The Creed of the United States Coast Guardsman was written by Vice Admiral Harry G  Hamlet  who served as Commandant of the Coast Guard from 1932 to 1936  43  44  I am proud to be a United States Coast Guardsman  I revere that long line of expert seamen who by their devotion to duty and sacrifice of self have made it possible for me to be a member of a service honored and respected  in peace and in war  throughout the world  I never  by word or deed  will bring reproach upon the fair name of my service  nor permit others to do so unchallenged  I will cheerfully and willingly obey all lawful orders  I will always be on time to relieve  and shall endeavor to do more  rather than less  than my share  I will always be at my station  alert and attending to my duties  I shall  so far as I am able  bring to my seniors solutions  not problems  I shall live joyously  but always with due regard for the rights and privileges of others  I shall endeavor to be a model citizen in the community in which I live  I shall sell life dearly to an enemy of my country  but give it freely to rescue those in peril  With God s help  I shall endeavor to be one of His noblest Works    A UNITED STATES COAST GUARDSMAN   edit  Coast Guard Ensign Coast Guard Ensign  The Coast Guard Ensign  flag  was first flown by the Revenue Cutter Service in 1799 to distinguish revenue cutters from merchant ships  The order stated the Ensign would be  sixteen perpendicular stripes  for the number of states in the United States at the time   alternate red and white  the union of the ensign to be the arms of the United States in a dark blue on a white field   45  This ensign became familiar in American waters and served as the sign of authority for the Revenue Cutter Service until the early 20th century  The ensign was originally intended to be flown only on revenue cutters and boats connected with the Customs Service but over the years it was found flying atop custom houses as well  and the practice became a requirement in 1874  On 7 June 1910  President William Howard Taft issued an Executive Order adding an emblem to  or  defacing   the ensign flown by the Revenue cutters to distinguish it from what is now called the Customs Ensign flown from the custom houses  The emblem was changed to the official seal of the U S  Coast Guard in 1927  46  47  The purpose of the ensign is to allow ship captains to easily recognize those vessels having legal authority to stop and board them  It is flown only as a symbol of law enforcement authority and is never carried as a parade standard  48   edit  Coast Guard Standard Parade Standard of the U S  Coast Guard  The Coast Guard Standard is used in parades and carries the battle honors of the U S  Coast Guard  It was derived from the jack of the Coast Guard ensign which used to fly from the stern of revenue cutters  The emblem is a blue eagle from the coat of arms of the United States on a white field  Above the eagle are the words  UNITED STATES COAST GUARD  below the eagle is the motto   SEMPER PARATUS  and the inscription  1790    edit  Racing Stripe Service Mark  also known as Racing Stripe   The racing stripe is borne by U S  Coast Guard cutters  aircraft  and many boats  Red hulled icebreaker cutters bear a narrow white bar  a narrow blue bar  and broad white bar  with the Coast Guard shield centered  Conversely  black hulled cutters  such as buoy tenders and inland construction tenders  use the standard racing stripe  Auxiliary vessels maintained by the Coast Guard also carry the Racing Stripe  but in inverted colors  i e   broad blue stripe over narrow white and CG red stripes  and the Auxiliary shield  The Racing Stripe  officially known as the Service Mark  was designed in 1964 by the industrial design office of Raymond Loewy Associates to give the Coast Guard a distinctive  modern image  First used in 1967  it consists of a narrow blue stripe  a narrow white stripe between  and a broad CG red bar with the Coast Guard shield centered  49  50  51  The stripes are canted at a 64 degree angle  coincidentally the year the Racing Stripe was designed  52  Similar Racing Stripe designs have been adopted for the use of other coast guards and maritime authorities  such as the Canadian Coast Guard  the Italian Guardia Costiera  the French Maritime Gendarmerie  the Indian Coast Guard  the German Federal Coast Guard  the Philippine Coast Guard  the Netherlands Coastguard  the European Maritime Safety Agency  the Australian Customs Service  and many other law enforcement and rescue agencies   edit  Semper Paratus The official march of

wore the same uniforms as the U S  Navy with distinctive Coast Guard insignia  primarily distinctive cap devices for officers and chief petty officers  incorporation of the Coast Guard shield in lieu of line or staff corps insignia for officers  and different buttons on dress uniforms  In 1972  the current Coast Guard  Service Dress Blue   SDB  uniform was introduced for wear by both officers and enlisted personnel  the transition was completed during 1974  The uniform consists of a blue four pocket single breasted jacket and trousers  A light blue button up shirt with a pointed collar  two front button flap pockets  and shoulder loops  along with a tie of the same shade as the jacket are worn with the uniform  Officer rank insignia parallels that of the U S  Navy but with the gold Navy  line  star being replaced with the gold Coast Guard Shield and with the Navy blue background color replaced by Coast Guard blue  Enlisted rank insignia is also similar to the Navy with the Coast Guard shield replacing the eagle on collar and cap devices  Group Rate marks  stripes  for junior enlisted members  E 3 and below  also follow U  S  Navy convention with white for seaman  red for fireman  and green for airman  In a departure from the U  S  Navy conventions  all Petty Officers E 6 and below wear red chevrons and all Chief Petty Officers wear gold  Unlike the U S  Navy  there are no khaki uniforms  and all personnel wear the same color uniform  54  The SDB uniform may be worn year round for business within the Coast Guard and for social occasions where the civilian equivalent is coat and tie  55  The  Tropical Blue  variation  worn in warm weather  omits the jacket and tie  and features a short sleeve shirt with rank insignia on shoulder boards for officers  and pin on collar insignia for Petty Officers  The Tropical Blue uniform may be worn year round for general office wear and for visits between commands  It may be worn in lieu of the SDB uniform  but not to functions where civilian dress is coat and tie  55  Coast Guardsmen in a change of command ceremony  Coast Guard officers also have a  Dress White  uniform  nearly identical to the  choker white  uniform worn by naval officers  aside from service specific insignia and sword design   typically used for formal parade and change of command ceremonies  For similar occasions enlisted members wear either Service Dress Blue or Full Dress Blue  Full Dress Blue replaces the light blue shirt with a white shirt  and full size medals are worn on the jacket  A white belt may be worn for honor guards  Mess dress uniforms are worn by members for formal  black tie  evening ceremonies  Like the officers  Dress White uniform  the mess dress uniforms are identical to those of the U S  Navy  aside from Coast Guard specific insignia  Admiral Allen in the Operational Dress Uniform  ODU   The current working uniform of the Coast Guard is the Operational Dress Uniform  ODU   The ODU may be worn year round primarily as a field utility and watchstanding uniform  and may be worn in an office environment  The ODU is similar to the Battle Dress Uniform of other armed services  both in function and style  However  the ODU is in a solid dark blue with no camouflage pattern and does not have lower pockets on the blouse  The first generation ODU  wearable until July 1  2012 is worn tucked in  The second generation ODU is worn untucked and has black Coast Guard insignias embroidered on the left shirt pocket as well as the side pockets of the trousers  The ODU is worn with composite toed boots in most circumstances  but low cut brown boat shoes may be prescribed for certain vessel boarding operations  A standard baseball style ball cap is worn  embroidered in gold block lettering with  U S  Coast Guard   Units may also additionally authorize ball caps with the unit name embroidered for wear while on the unit  A foul weather parka is the outerwear worn with the ODU  The former dark blue working uniform has been withdrawn from use by the Coast Guard but may be worn by Auxiliarists until no longer serviceable  Coast Guard personnel serving in expeditionary combat units such as Port Security Units  Law Enforcement Detachments  and others  wear the Camouflage Utility Uniform  CUU  with the woodland or desert pattern color scheme based on the operational commander s guidance  An eight point cap is worn with rank insignia  The camouflaged utility sun hat may be worn when prescribed by the operational commander  without rank insignia  All Coast Guardsmen wear the combination cap with all uniforms except the ODU and CUU  Company commanders  the Coast Guard s equivalent of drill sergeants  at Training Center Cape May wear the traditional  Smokey Bear  campaign hat  A 2006 issuePDF  27 MB  of the Reservist magazine was devoted to a detailed and easy to understand graphical description of all the uniforms displayed as prescribed at that time   edit  Issues The Coast Guard faces several issues in the near future  Lack of coverage affects many areas with high maritime traffic  For example  local officials in Scituate  Massachusetts  have complained that there is no permanent Coast Guard station  and the presence of the Coast Guard in winter is vital  One reason for this lack of coverage is the relatively high cost of building storm proof buildings on coastal property  the Cape Hatteras station was abandoned in 2005 after winter storms wiped out the 12 foot  3 7 m  sand dune serving as its protection from the ocean  Faced with these issues the Coast Guard has contracted with General Dynamics C4 System to provide a complete replacement of their 1970s era radio equipment  Rescue 21 is the United States Coast Guard s advanced command  control and communications system  Created to improve the ability to assist mariners in distress and save lives and property at sea  the system is currently being installed in stages across the United States  The nation s existing maritime search and rescue  SAR  communications system has been in operation since the early 1970s  Difficult to maintain  increasingly unreliable and prone to coverage gaps  this antiquated system no longer meets the safety needs of America s growing marine traffic  In addition  it is incapable of supporting the Coast Guard s new mission requirements for homeland security  which require close cooperation with Department of Defense agencies as well as federal  state and local law enforcement authorities  Modernizing this system enhances the safety and protection of America s waterways  Lack of strength to meet its assigned missions is being met by a legislated increase in authorized strength from 39 000 to 45 000  In addition  the volunteer Auxiliary acts as an air and surface resource in support of a variety of missions conducted by Coast Guard units  Aging vessels are another problem  with the Coast Guard still operating some of the oldest naval vessels in the world  In 2005  the Coast Guard terminated contracts to upgrade the 110 foot  33 5 m  Island Class Cutters to 123 foot  37 m  cutters because of warping and distortion of the hulls  In late 2006  Admiral Thad Allen  Commandant of the Coast Guard  decommissioned all eight 123 foot  37 m  cutters due to dangerous conditions created by the lengthening of the hull  to include compromised watertight integrity  The Coast Guard has  as a result of the failed 110 ft  34 m  conversion  revised production schedules for the Fast Response Cutter  FRC   Of the navies and coast guards of the world s 40 largest navies  the U S  Coast Guard has the 38th oldest surface fleet  56  Live fire exercises by Coast Guard boat and cutter crews in the U S  waters of the Great Lakes attracted attention in the U S  and Canada  The Coast Guard had proposed the establishment of 34 locations around the Great Lakes where live fire training using vessel mounted machine guns were to be conducted periodically throughout the year  The Coast Guard said that these exercises are a critical part of proper crew training in support of the service s multiple missions on the Great Lakes  including law enforcement and anti terrorism  Those that raised concerns about the firing exercises commented about safety concerns and that the impact on commercial shipping  tourism  recreational boating and the environment may be greater than what the Coast Guard had stated  The Coast Guard took public comment and conducted a series of nine public meetings on this issue  After receiving more than 1 000 comments  mostly opposing the Coast Guard s plan  the Coast Guard announced that they were withdrawing their proposal for target practice on the Great Lakes  although a revised proposal may be made in the future  57  58  59  60  61

Guard Reserve The United States Coast Guard Reserve is the reserve military force of the Coast Guard  63  The Coast Guard Reserve was founded on 19 February 1941  Coast Guard reservists normally drill two days a month and an additional twelve days of active duty each year  Coast Guard reservists possess the same training and qualifications as their active duty counterparts  and as such  can be found augmenting active duty Coast Guard units every day  During the Vietnam War and shortly thereafter  the Coast Guard considered abandoning the reserve program  but the force was instead reoriented into force augmentation  where its principal focus was not just reserve operations  but to add to the readiness and mission execution of every day active duty personnel  Since 11 September 2001  over 8 500 reservists have been activated and served on tours of active duty  to include deployments to the Persian Gulf and also as parts of Department of Defense combatant commands such as the U S  Northern Command and Central Command  Coast Guard Port Security Units are entirely staffed with reservists  except for five to seven active duty personnel  Additionally  most of the staffing the Coast Guard provides to the Navy Expeditionary Combat Command are reservists  The Reserve is managed by the Acting Director of Reserve and Leadership  CG 13   RDML David R  Callahan   edit  Coast Guard Auxiliary Main article  United States Coast Guard Auxiliary The United States Coast Guard Auxiliary is the uniformed volunteer component of the Coast Guard  established on 23 June 1939 by an act of

missions  64  Auxiliarists are subject to direction from the Commandant of the Coast Guard making them unique among all federal volunteers  e g  Air Force s Civil Air Patrol and FBI s Infragard   As of May 2010  there were approximately 30 000 active Auxiliarists  65  The Coast Guard has assigned primary responsibility for many recreational boating safety tasks to the Auxiliary  including public boating safety education and voluntary vessel safety checks  Prior to 1997  Auxiliarists were limited to those tasks and on water patrols supporting recreational boating safety  In 1997  however  new legislation authorized the Auxiliary to participate in any and all Coast Guard missions except direct military and direct law enforcement  66  Auxiliarists may support the law enforcement mission of the Coast Guard but may not directly participate in it  and Auxiliarists and their vessels are not permitted to carry a weapon while serving in any Auxiliary capacity  Auxiliarists use their own
