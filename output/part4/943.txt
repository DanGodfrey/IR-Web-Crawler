east coast of the Tasman Sea  As of June 2010  the greater metropolitan area had an approximate population of 4 6 million people  1  Inhabitants of Sydney are called Sydneysiders  comprising a cosmopolitan and international population  4  The site of the first British colony in Australia  Sydney was established in 1788 at Sydney Cove by Arthur Phillip  commodore of the First Fleet as a penal colony  5  The city is built on hills surrounding Port Jackson which is commonly known as Sydney Harbour  where the iconic Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge feature prominently  The hinterland of the metropolitan area is surrounded by national parks  and the coastal regions feature many bays  rivers  inlets and beaches including the famous Bondi Beach  Within the city are many notable parks  including Hyde Park and the Royal Botanic Gardens  Sydney ranks among the top 10 world centres  6  7  8  9  In 2010  Sydney was ranked 7th in Asia and 28th globally for economic

17  The traditional Indigenous inhabitants of Sydney Cove are the Cadigal people  whose land once stretched from south of Port Jackson to Petersham  18  While estimates of the population numbers prior to the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788 remains contentious  approximately 4 000 8 000 Aboriginal people lived in the Sydney region prior to contact with British settlers  The British called the Indigenous people the  Eora   19  because being asked where they came from  these people would answer   Eora   meaning  here   or  from this place  in their language  18  There were three language groups in the Sydney region  which were divided into dialects spoken by smaller clans  The principal languages were Darug  the Cadigal  original inhabitants of the City of Sydney  spoke a coastal dialect of Darug   Dharawal and Guringai  Each clan had a territory  the location of said territory determined the resources available  Although urbanisation has destroyed much evidence of these settlements  such as shell middens   a number of Sydney rock engravings  carvings and rock art remain visible in the Hawkesbury sandstone of the Sydney basin  20  A Direct North General View of Sydney Cove  painted by convict and artist Thomas Watling in 1794 In 1770  British sea Captain Lieutenant James Cook landed in Botany Bay on the Kurnell Peninsula  It is here that Cook made first contact with an Aboriginal community known as the Gweagal  21  Under instruction from the British government  a convict settlement was founded by Arthur Phillip  who arrived at Botany Bay with a fleet of 11 ships on 18 January 1788  This site was soon determined to be unsuitable for habitation  owing to poor soil and a lack of reliable fresh water  Phillip subsequently founded the colony one inlet further up the coast  at Sydney Cove on Port Jackson on 26 January 1788  However the official proclamation of the founding and naming of Sydney took place only on 7 February 1788 when he named it after the British Home Secretary  Thomas Townshend  Lord Sydney  in recognition of Sydney s role in issuing the charter authorising Phillip to establish a colony  The original name was intended to be Albion until Phillip decided upon Sydney  22  However in 1789  shortly after the arrival in Botany Bay of the French expedition led by La Perouse  a catastrophic epidemic disease smallpox or possibly chicken pox spread through the Eora people and surrounding groups  with the result that local Aborigines died in their thousands  and bodies could often be seen bobbing in the water in Sydney Harbour  23  Colonial historian and First Fleet officer Watkin Tench  whose accounts are primary sources about the early years of the colony  suggested that the epidemic may have been caused by Aborigines disturbing the grave of a French sailor who died shortly after arrival in Australia  supposedly of smallpox  and had been buried at Botany Bay  24  Sydney harbour in 1932 In April 1789 a disease  thought to be smallpox  killed an estimated 500 to 1000 Aboriginal people between Broken Bay and Botany Bay  19  There was violent resistance to British settlement  notably by the warrior Pemulwuy in the area around Botany Bay  and conflicts were common in the area surrounding the Hawkesbury River  By 1820 there were only a few hundred Aborigines and Governor Macquarie had begun initiatives to  civilise  Christianise and educate  the Aborigines by removing them from their clans  19  Macquarie s tenure as Governor of New South Wales was a period when Sydney was improved from its basic beginnings  Roads  bridges  wharves and public buildings were constructed by British and Irish convicts  and by 1822 the town had banks  markets  well established thoroughfares and an organised constabulary  The 1830s and 1840s were periods of urban development including the development of the first suburbs  as the town grew rapidly when ships began arriving from Britain and Ireland with immigrants looking to start a new life in a new country  On 20 July 1842 the municipal council of Sydney was incorporated and the town was declared the first city in Australia  with John Hosking the first elected mayor  25  The first of several Australian gold rushes started in 1851  and the port of Sydney has since seen many waves of people arriving from around the world  Rapid suburban development began in the last quarter of the 19th century with the advent of steam powered tramways and railways  With industrialisation Sydney expanded rapidly  and by the early 20th century it had a population of more than a million  In 1929  the novelist Arthur Henry Adams called it the  Siren City of the South  and the  Athens of Australia   26  The Great Depression hit Sydney badly  One of the highlights of the Depression era  however  was the completion of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932  27  There has traditionally been a rivalry between Sydney and Melbourne since the gold rushes of the 1850s made the capital of Victoria  Australia s largest and richest city  28  Sydney overtook Melbourne in population in the early years of the 20th century  29  and has remained the largest city in Australia since this time  During the 1970s and 1980s Sydney s CBD with a great number of financial institutions including the headquarters of the Reserve Bank surpassed Melbourne as the nation s financial capital  30  Throughout the 20th century  especially in the decades immediately following World War II  Sydney continued to expand as large numbers of European and later Asian immigrants populated the metropolitan area   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of Sydney  edit  Topography Sydney s urban area is in a coastal basin  which is bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the East  the Blue Mountains to the West  the Hawkesbury River to the North and the Royal National Park to the South  It lies on a submergent coastline  where the ocean level has risen to flood deep river valleys  ria  carved in the hawkesbury sandstone  Port Jackson  better known as Sydney Harbour  is one such ria  31  The Sydney area is not affected by significant earthquakes  The urban area has around 70 harbour and ocean beaches  including the famous Bondi Beach  Sydney s urban area covers 1 687 km2  651 sq mi  as of 2001  32  The Sydney Statistical Division  used for census data  is the unofficial metropolitan area 33  and covers 12 145 km2  4 689 sq mi   34  This area includes the Central Coast  the Blue Mountains  and national parks and other unurbanised land  Geographically  Sydney lies over two regions  the Cumberland Plain  a relatively flat region lying to the south and west of the harbour  and the Hornsby Plateau  a sandstone plateau lying mainly to the north of the harbour and dissected by steep valleys  The parts of the city with the oldest European development are located in the flat areas south of the harbour  The North Shore was slower to develop because of its hilly topography and lack of access across the harbour  The Sydney Harbour Bridge was opened in 1932 and linked the North Shore to the rest of the city  35   edit  Geology Main article  Sydney Basin Sydney is mostly Triassic rock  with a some recent igneous dykes and the volcanic neck  The Hawkesbury sandstone is some 200 metres  660 ft  thick  with shale lenses and fossil riverbeds dotted throughout it  Almost all of the rocks exposed around Sydney will be sandstone  The sand that was to become this sandstone was laid down in the Triassic period  about two hundred million years ago  a time when plants were ferns  reptiles were becoming dinosaurs  and mammals did not exist yet  The Sydney Basin sits on the east coast of Australia  which is made up of a basin filled with near horizontal sandstones and shales of Permian to Triassic age that overlie older basement rocks of the Lachlan Fold Belt  The sedimentary rocks have been subject to uplift with gentle folding and minor faulting during the formation of the Great Dividing Range  Erosion by coastal streams have created a landscape of deep cliffed gorges and remains of plateaus across  The Sydney Basin Bioregion includes coastal landscapes of cliffs  beaches and estuaries  36  The sandstone that characterises Sydney was laid down almost 200 million years ago  The sand was washed from Broken Hill  and laid down in a bed that is about 200 metres  660 ft  thick  Currents washed through it  leaching out most of the minerals and leaving a very poor rock that made an insipid soil  They washed out channels in some places  while in others  the currents formed sand banks that show a characteristic current bedding or cross bedding that can often be seen in cuttings  Sydney is on low rolling hills with wide valleys  situated in a rain shadow zone below the Blue Mountains  37   edit  Climate Further information  Climate of Sydney  New South Wales Avalon beach during spring Sydney has a temperate climate with warm summers and mild winters  Rainfall is spread throughout the year  38  The weather is moderated by proximity to the ocean  and more extreme temperatures are recorded in the inland western suburbs  The warmest month is January  with an average air temperature range at Observatory Hill of 18 6 25 8  C  65 78  F   An average of 14 6 days a year have temperatures of more than 30  C  86 0  F   In winter  temperatures rarely drop below 5  C  41  F  in coastal areas  The coldest month is July  with an average range of 8 0 16 2  C  46 61  F   Rainfall is fairly evenly spread through the year  but is slightly higher during the first half of the year  when easterly winds dominate  citation needed  The average annual rainfall  with moderate to low variability  is 1 217 mm  48 in   falling on an average 138 days a year  39  Snowfall was last reported in the Sydney City area in 1836  40  However  a July 2008 fall of graupel  or soft hail  mistaken by many for snow  has raised the possibility that the 1836 event was not snow  either  41  Extreme temperatures have ranged from 45 3  C  113 5  F  on 14 January 1939 at the end of a four day heatwave across Australia and 2 1  C  35 8  F   the lowest recorded minimum at Observatory Hill  42  The city is not affected by cyclones  The El Ni o Southern Oscillation plays an important role in determining Sydney s weather patterns  drought and bushfire on the one hand  and storms and flooding on the other  associated with the opposite phases of the oscillation  Many areas of the city bordering bushland have experienced bushfires  these tend to occur during the spring and summer  The city is also prone to severe hail storms and wind storms  One such storm was the 1999 hailstorm  which severely damaged Sydney s eastern and city suburbs  The storm produced massive hailstones of at least 9 cm  3 5 in  in diameter and resulting in insurance losses of around A 1 7 billion in less than five hours  43  The next notable event was in the first weeks of February 2010 when Sydney received some of the highest rainfalls in 25 years  which caused flash flooding and traffic chaos  43  The Bureau of Meteorology has reported that 2002 through 2005 were the warmest summers in Sydney since records began in 1859  44  The summer of 2007 08  however  proved to be one of the coolest summers on record  45  Warmer and drier conditions came back in 2009 and 2010 that recorded above average temperatures  2011 recorded above average rainfall  46  In 2009 the dry conditions brought a severe dust storm towards eastern Australia  47  48  Average annual temperature of the sea is above 21  C  70  F   from 19  C  66  F  in July to 24  C  75  F  in January  49  Climate data for Sydney Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year

limited role of the Cumberland County Council from 1945 1964  there has never been an overall governing body for the Sydney metropolitan area  instead  the metropolitan area is divided into local government areas  LGAs  which are comparable to boroughs in cities such as London  These areas have elected councils which are responsible for functions delegated to them by the New South Wales State Government  such as planning and garbage collection  NSW Parliament House  The State Government controls most citywide activities  The City of Sydney includes the central business area and some adjoining inner suburbs  and has in recent years been expanded through amalgamation with adjoining local government areas  such as South Sydney  It is led by the elected Lord Mayor of Sydney and a council  The Lord Mayor  however  is sometimes treated as a representative of the whole city  for example during the Olympics  99  Most citywide government activities are controlled by the state government  These include public transport  main roads  traffic control  policing  education above preschool level  and planning of major infrastructure projects  100  Because a large proportion of the New South Wales population lives in Sydney  state governments have traditionally been reluctant to allow the development of citywide governmental bodies  which would tend to rival the state government  For this reason  Sydney has always been a focus for the politics of both state and federal parliaments  For example  the boundaries of the City of Sydney LGA have been significantly altered by state governments on at least four occasions since 1945  with expected advantageous effect to the governing party in the New South Wales Parliament at the time  101  The 38 LGAs commonly described as making up Sydney are  Ashfield Auburn Bankstown Blacktown Botany Bay Burwood Camden Campbelltown Canada Bay Canterbury Fairfield The Hills Holroyd Hornsby Hunter s Hill Hurstville Kogarah Ku ring gai Lane Cove Leichhardt Liverpool Manly Marrickville Mosman North Sydney Parramatta Penrith Pittwater Randwick Rockdale Ryde Strathfield Sutherland Sydney Warringah Waverley Willoughby Woollahra The classification of which councils make up Sydney varies  The Local Government Association of New South Wales considers all LGAs lying entirely in Cumberland County as part of its  Metro  group  which excludes Camden  classed in its  Country  group   102  The Australian Bureau of Statistics defines a Sydney Statistical Division  the population figures of which are used in this article  that includes all of the above councils as well as Wollondilly  the Blue Mountains  Hawkesbury  Gosford and Wyong  103   edit  Education The University of Sydney  established in 1850  is the oldest university in Australia Main article  Education in Sydney Sydney is home to some of Australia s most prominent educational institutions  104  The University of Sydney  established in 1850  is Australia s oldest university and the largest in Sydney  Other public universities located in Sydney include the University of Technology  Sydney  the University of New South Wales  Macquarie University  the University of Western Sydney and the Australian Catholic University  two out of six campuses   Other universities which operate secondary campuses in Sydney include the University of Notre Dame Australia  the University of Wollongong and Curtin University of Technology  There are four multi campus government funded Technical and Further Education  TAFE  institutes in Sydney  which provide vocational training at a tertiary level  the Sydney Institute of Technology  Northern Sydney Institute of TAFE  Western Sydney Institute of TAFE and South Western Sydney Institute of TAFE  Sydney has public  denominational and independent schools  Public schools  including pre schools  primary and secondary schools  and special schools are administered by the New South Wales Department of Education and Training  There are four state administered education areas in Sydney  that together co ordinate 919 schools  citation needed  Of the 30 selective high schools in the state  25 are in Sydney  105   edit  Infrastructure  edit  Health systems Health services are delivered through a mix of public and private systems  funded by government  from tax revenue  and private health insurance  The government of New South Wales operates several large public hospitals in the Sydney metropolitan region  Management of these hospitals and other specialist health facilities is coordinated by the eight metropolitan Local Health Districts  LHDs   These eight LHDs cover the Sydney metropolitan region  and seven more cover rural and regional NSW  In addition  two specialist networks focus on Children s and Paediatric Services  and Forensic Mental Health  A third network operates across the public health services provided in three Sydney facilities operated by St Vincent s Health  these include St Vincent s Hospital and the Sacred Heart Hospice at Darlinghurst and St Joseph s at Auburn  The largest teaching hospitals are  the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital  The Prince of Wales Hospital and the Royal North Shore Hospital   edit  Transport Main article  Public transport in Sydney The Anzac Bridge  spanning Johnstons Bay between Pyrmont and Glebe Island in proximity to Sydney s central business district  with the Sydney Harbour Bridge in the background A Waratah CityRail A set train at Sydney s Central Station  Domestic Terminal at Sydney Airport  Most Sydney residents travel by car through the system of roads  freeways and tollways  known as motorways   The most important trunk routes in the urban area are the nine Metroads  which include the 110 km  68 mi  Sydney Orbital Network  Sydney is also served by train  taxi  bus and ferry networks  Trains in Sydney are run by CityRail  a state run corporation  Trains run as suburban commuter rail services in the outer suburbs  then converge in an underground city loop service in the central business district  In the years following the 2000 Olympics  CityRail s performance declined significantly  106  In 2005  CityRail introduced a revised timetable and employed more drivers  107  A large infrastructure project  the Clearways project  is scheduled to be completed by 2010  108  109  110  In 2007 a report found Cityrail performed poorly compared to many metro services from other world cities  111  Figures released by RailCorp show that during the period of 2011 2012  95 4  of trains arrived on time 112  and 99 6  of services ran as scheduled  113  However  a survey conducted in September 2011 revealed that 6 of the 13 lines had a maximum load that exceeded 135   of the seated capacity  during the peak morning commute  114  Sydney has one privately operated light rail line  Metro Light Rail  running from Central Station to Lilyfield along a former goods train line  The Metro Monorail runs in a loop around the main shopping district and Darling Harbour  Sydney was once served by an extensive tram network  which was progressively closed in the 1950s and 1960s  115  Most parts of the metropolitan area are served by buses  many of which follow the pre 1961 tram routes  In the city and inner suburbs the state owned Sydney Buses has a monopoly  In the outer suburbs  service is contracted to many private bus companies  Construction of a network of rapid bus transitways in areas not previously well served by public transport began in 1999  and the first of these  the Liverpool Parramatta Rapid Bus Transitway  opened in February 2003  State government owned Sydney Ferries runs numerous commuter and tourist ferry services on Sydney Harbour and the Parramatta River  116  Sydney Airport  in the suburb of Mascot  is Sydney s main airport  and is one of the oldest continually operated airports in the world  117  The smaller Bankstown Airport mainly serves private and general aviation  There is a light aviation airfield at Camden  RAAF Base Richmond lies to the north west of the city  The question of the need for a Second Sydney Airport has raised much controversy  A 2003 study found that Sydney Airport can manage as Sydney s sole international airport for 20 years  with a significant increase in airport traffic predicted  118  The resulting expansion of the airport would have a substantial impact on the community  including additional aircraft noise affecting residents  Land has been acquired at Badgerys Creek for a second airport  the site acting as a focal point of political argument  119  Sydney s notably low population density can be traced in part to its public transport network  The city  founded in 1788 acquired its public transport system relatively early on in its life   rail services began in 1855  Working class suburbs could thus be built far from the city centre  whereas in older cities the need to maintain walking distance between residential and employment centres kept sprawl to a minimum  120   edit  Utilities Water storage and supply for Sydney is managed by the Sydney Catchment Authority  which is an agency of the NSW Government that sells bulk water to Sydney Water and other agencies  Water in the Sydney catchment is chiefly stored in dams in the Upper Nepean Scheme  the Blue Mountains  Woronora Dam  Warragamba Dam and the Shoalhaven Scheme  121  Historically low water levels in the catchment have led to water use restrictions and the NSW government is investigating alternative water supply options  including grey water recycling and the construction of a seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant at Kurnell  122  As of May 2009  the plant was 80  completed  and was due to start supplying fresh water to Sydney at the end of the year  123  In late January 2010  the NSW government announced that desalination plant was operating and people in different regions were being supplied with desalinated water  Sydney Water also collects the wastewater and sewage produced by the city  Two distributors supply electricity to Sydney  Ausgrid  previously Energy Australia   and Endeavour Energy  previously Integral Energy   There are several retailers including TRUenergy  Origin Energy  AGL Energy  and others  Several companies supply natural gas to Sydney through retailers  AGL  TRUenergy  Origin Energy and others  The natural gas supply for the city is sourced from the Cooper Basin in South Australia  Numerous telecommunications companies operate in Sydney providing terrestrial and mobile telecommunications
