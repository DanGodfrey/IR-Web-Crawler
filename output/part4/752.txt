of Hewlett Packard executive leadership  edit  Founding Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard graduated with degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1935  The company originated in a garage in nearby Palo Alto during a fellowship they had with a past professor  Frederick Terman at Stanford during the Great Depression  Terman was considered a mentor to them in forming Hewlett Packard  7  In 1939  Packard and Hewlett established Hewlett Packard  HP  in Packard s garage with an initial capital investment of US 538  8  Hewlett and Packard tossed a coin to decide whether the company they founded would be called Hewlett Packard or Packard Hewlett 9  Packard won the coin toss but named their manufacturing enterprise the  Hewlett Packard Company   citation needed  HP incorporated on August 18  1947  and went public on November 6  1957  Of the many projects they worked on  their very first financially successful product was a precision audio oscillator  the Model HP200A  Their innovation was the use of a small incandescent light bulb  known as a  pilot light   as a temperature dependent resistor in a critical portion of the circuit  the negative feedback loop which stabilized the amplitude of the output sinusoidal waveform  This allowed them to sell the Model 200A for  54 40 when competitors were selling less stable oscillators for over  200  The Model 200 series of generators continued until at least 1972 as the 200AB  still tube based but improved in design through the years  One of the company s earliest customers was Walt Disney Productions  which bought eight Model 200B oscillators  at  71 50 each  for use in certifying the Fantasound surround sound systems installed in theaters for the movie Fantasia   edit  Early years This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Original 1954 Hewlett Packard trademark The company was originally rather unfocused  working on a wide range of electronic products for industry and even agriculture  Eventually they elected to focus on high quality electronic test and measurement equipment  From the 1940s until well into the 1990s the company concentrated on making electronic test equipment  signal generators  voltmeters  oscilloscopes  frequency counters  thermometers  time standards  wave analyzers  and many other instruments  A distinguishing feature was pushing the limits of measurement range and accuracy  many HP instruments were more sensitive  accurate  and precise than other comparable equipment  Following the pattern set by the company s first product  the 200A  test instruments were labelled with three to five digits followed by the letter  A   Improved versions went to suffixes  B  through  E   As the product range grew wider HP started using product designators starting with a letter for accessories  supplies  software  and components   edit  The 1960s HP is recognized as the symbolic founder of Silicon Valley  although it did not actively investigate semiconductor devices until a few years after the  Traitorous Eight  had abandoned William Shockley to create Fairchild Semiconductor in 1957  Hewlett Packard s HP Associates division  established around 1960  developed semiconductor devices primarily for internal use  Instruments and calculators were some of the products using these devices  HP partnered in the 1960s with Sony and the Yokogawa Electric companies in Japan to develop several high quality products  The products were not a huge success  as there were high costs in building HP looking products in Japan  HP and Yokogawa formed a joint venture  Yokogawa Hewlett Packard  in 1963 to market HP products in Japan  10  HP bought Yokogawa Electric s share of Hewlett Packard Japan in 1999  11  HP spun off a small company  Dynac  to specialize in digital equipment  The name was picked so that the HP logo  hp  could be turned upside down to be a reverse reflect image of the logo  dy  of the new company  Eventually Dynac changed to Dymec  then was folded back into HP in 1959  12  HP experimented with using Digital Equipment Corporation minicomputers with its instruments  but after deciding that it would be easier to build another small design team than deal with DEC  HP entered the computer market in 1966 with the HP 2100   HP 1000 series of minicomputers  These had a simple accumulator based design  with registers arranged somewhat similarly to the Intel x86 architecture still used today  The series was produced for 20 years  in spite of several attempts to replace it  and was a forerunner of the HP 9800 and HP 250 series of desktop and business computers   edit  The 1970s Hewlett Packard logo  mid 1970s The HP 3000 was an advanced stack based design for a business computing server  later redesigned with RISC technology  The HP 2640 series of smart and intelligent terminals introduced forms based interfaces to ASCII terminals  and also introduced screen labeled function keys  now commonly used on gas pumps and bank ATMs  The HP 2640 series included one of the first bit mapped graphics displays that when combined with the HP 2100 21MX F Series microcoded Scientific Instruction Set 13  enabled the first commercial WYSIWYG Presentation Program  BRUNO that later became the program HP Draw on the HP 3000  Although scoffed at in the formative days of computing  HP would eventually surpass even IBM as the world s largest technology vendor  in terms of sales  14   The new Hewlett Packard 9100A personal computer is ready  willing  and able     to relieve you of waiting to get on the big computer   HP is identified by Wired magazine as the producer of the world s first marketed  mass produced personal computer  the Hewlett Packard 9100A  introduced in 1968  15  HP called it a desktop calculator  because  as Bill Hewlett said   If we had called it a computer  it would have been rejected by our customers  computer gurus because it didn t look like an IBM  We therefore decided to call it a calculator  and all such nonsense disappeared   An engineering triumph at the time  the logic circuit was produced without any integrated circuits  the assembly of the CPU having been entirely executed in discrete components  With CRT display  magnetic card storage  and printer  the price was around  5000  The machine s keyboard was a cross between that of a scientific calculator and an adding machine  There was no alphabetic keyboard  Steve Wozniak  co founder of Apple  originally designed the Apple I computer while working at HP and offered it to them under their right of first refusal to his work  but they did not take it up as the company wanted to stay in scientific  business  and industrial markets  citation needed  The company earned global respect for a variety of products  They introduced the world s first handheld scientific electronic calculator in 1972  the HP 35   the first handheld programmable in 1974  the HP 65   the first alphanumeric  programmable  expandable in 1979  the HP 41C   and the first symbolic and graphing calculator  the HP 28C  Like their scientific and business calculators  their oscilloscopes  logic analyzers  and other measurement instruments have a reputation for sturdiness and usability  the latter products are now part of spin off Agilent s product line   The company s design philosophy in this period was summarized as  design for the guy at the next bench   citation needed  The 98x5 series of technical desktop computers started in 1975 with the 9815  and the cheaper 80 series  again of technical computers  started in 1979 with the 85  16  These machines used a version of the BASIC programming language which was available immediately after they were switched on  and used a proprietary magnetic tape for storage  HP computers were similar in capabilities to the much later IBM Personal Computer  although the limitations of available technology forced prices to be high  citation needed   edit  The 1980s The garage in Palo Alto where Hewlett and Packard began their company In 1984  HP introduced both inkjet and laser printers for the desktop  Along with its scanner product line  these have later been developed into successful multifunction products  the most significant being single unit printer scanner copier fax machines  The print mechanisms in HP s tremendously popular LaserJet line of laser printers depend almost entirely on Canon s components  print engines   which in turn use technology developed by Xerox  HP develops the hardware  firmware  and software that convert data into dots for the mechanism to print  citation needed  HP transitioned from the HP3000 to the HP9000 series minicomputers with attached storage such as the HP 7935 hard drive holding 404 MiB  On March 3  1986  HP registered the HP com domain name  making it the ninth Internet  com domain ever to be registered  17  In 1987  the Palo Alto garage where Hewlett and Packard started their business was designated as a California State historical landmark   edit  The 1990s Hewlett Packard logo used until 2008 In the 1990s  HP expanded their computer product line  which initially had been targeted at university  research  and business users  to reach consumers  HP also grew through acquisitions  buying Apollo Computer in 1989 and Convex Computer in 1995  Later in the decade  HP opened hpshopping com as an independent subsidiary to sell online  direct to consumers  in 2005  the store was renamed  HP Home  amp  Home Office Store   From 1995 to 1998  Hewlett Packard were sponsors of the English football team Tottenham Hotspur  In 1999  all of the businesses not related to computers  storage  and imaging were spun off from HP to form Agilent  Agilent s spin off was the largest initial public offering in the history of Silicon Valley  18  The spin off created an  8 billion company with about 30 000 employees  manufacturing scientific instruments  semiconductors  optical networking devices  and electronic test equipment for telecom and wireless R amp D and production  In July 1999  HP appointed Carly Fiorina as CEO  the first female CEO of a company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average  Fiorina served as CEO during the technology industry downturn of the early 2000s  During her tenure  the market value of HP halved and the company incurred heavy job losses  19  The HP Board of Directors asked Fiorina to step down in 2005  and she resigned on February 9  2005   edit  The 2000s Hewlett Packard Deskjet 3845 printer The current two

officially merged with Compaq  Prior to this  plans had been in place to consolidate the companies  product teams and product lines  21  In 1998 Compaq had already taken over the Digital Equipment Corporation  That is why HP still offers support for PDP 11  VAX and AlphaServer  The merger occurred after a proxy fight with Bill Hewlett s son Walter  who objected to the merger  Compaq itself had bought Tandem Computers in 1997  which had been started by ex HP employees   and Digital Equipment Corporation in 1998  Following this strategy  HP became a major player in desktops  laptops  and servers for many different markets  After the merger with Compaq  the new ticker symbol became  HPQ   a combination of the two previous symbols   HWP  and  CPQ   to show the significance of the alliance and also key letters from the two companies Hewlett Packard and Compaq  the latter company being famous for its  Q  logo on all of its products   In the year 2004 HP released the DV 1000 Series  including the HP Pavilion dv 1658 and 1040 two years later in May 2006  HP began its campaign  The Computer is Personal Again  The campaign was designed to bring back the fact that the PC is a

going to be purchased by either HTC  Dell  RIM or HP  The addition of Palm handsets to the HP product line provides some overlap with the current iPAQ mobile products but will significantly increase their mobile presence as those devices have not been selling well  The addition of Palm brings HP a library of valuable patents as well the mobile operating platform known as webOS  On July 1  2010  the acquisition of Palm was final  26  The purchase of Palm  Inc  s webOS began a big gamble   to build HP s own ecosystem  27  On July 1  2011  HP launched its first tablet named HP TouchPad

commercial and government markets  31  They also contemplated spinning off their personal computer division into a separate company  32  HP s consideration of a fundamental restructuring to quit the  PC  business  while continuing to sell servers and other equipment to business customers  would have been similar to what IBM did in 2005  33  However  after a brief review  HP decided their PC

Newsweek revealed that HP s general counsel  at the behest of chairwoman Patricia Dunn  contracted a team of independent security experts to investigate board members and several journalists in order to identify the source of an information leak  85  In turn  those security experts recruited private investigators who used a spying technique known as pretexting  86  The pretexting involved investigators impersonating HP board members and nine journalists  including reporters for CNET  the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal  in order to obtain their phone records  The information leaked related to HP s long term strategy and was published as part of a CNET article 87  in January 2006  Most HP employees accused of criminal acts have since been acquitted  88   edit  Hardware Hewlett Packard has also been at the center of a fiasco in recent years  In November 2007  Hewlett Packard released a BIOS update covering a wide range of laptops with the intent to speed up the computer fan as well as have it run constantly  whether the computer was on or off  89  The reason was to prevent the overheating of defective NVIDIA graphics processing units  GPUs  that had been shipped to many of the original equipment manufacturers  including Hewlett Packard  Dell  and Apple  90  In July 2008  HP revealed an extension to the initial one year warranty covering a few of the affected computers  but leaving many more without the protection  despite research showing that these computers were also affected  91  Since this point  several websites have been documenting the issue  most notably www hplies com and nvidiasettlement com  a forum dedicated to what they refer to as Hewlett Packard s  multi million dollar cover up  of the issue  There have been several small claims lawsuits filed in several states  as well as suits filed in other countries  Hewlett Packard also faced a class action lawsuit in 2009 over its i7 processor computers  The complainants stated that their systems locked up within 30 minutes of powering on  consistently  Even after being replaced with newer i7 systems  the lockups continued  92   edit  HP and Oracle lawsuit On June 15  2011  HP filed a lawsuit in California Superior Court in Santa Clara  claiming that Oracle had breached an agreement to support the Itanium microprocessor used in HP s high end enterprise servers  93  On June 15  2011  HP sent a  formal legal demand  letter to Oracle in an attempt to force the world s No  3 software maker to reverse its decision to discontinue software development on Intel Itanium microprocessor  94   edit  Notable people Michael Capellas  Compaq CEO Chairman   HP President   95  Rahul Sood  VoodooPC Founder   96  Steve Jobs  Summer job   97  Steve Wozniak  calculator designer
