Major film studio From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search A major film studio is a movie production and distribution company that releases a substantial number of films annually and consistently commands a significant share of box office revenues in a given market  In the North American  Western  and global markets  the major film studios  often simply known as the majors  are commonly regarded as the six diversified media conglomerates whose various movie production and distribution subsidiaries command approximately 90 percent of the U S  and Canadian box office  The term may also be applied more specifically to the primary movie business subsidiary of each respective conglomerate  The  Big Six  majors  whose movie operations are based in or around Hollywood  are all centered in film studios active during Hollywood s Golden Age of the 1930s and 1940s  In three cases 20th Century Fox  Warner Bros   and Paramount the studios were one of the  Big Five  majors during that era as well  In two cases Columbia and Universal the studios were also considered majors  but in the next tier down  part of the  Little Three   In the sixth case  Walt Disney Studios was an independent production company during the Golden Age  it was an important Hollywood entity  but not a major  Most of today s Big Six control subsidiaries with their own distribution networks that concentrate on arthouse pictures  e g   Fox Searchlight  or genre films  e g   Sony s Screen Gems   several of these specialty units were shut down or sold off between 2008 and 2010  The six major movie studios are contrasted with smaller movie production and or distribution companies  which are known as independents or  indies   The leading independent producer distributors Lionsgate  The Weinstein Company  Relativity Media  FilmDistrict  CBS Films  and former major studio MGM are sometimes referred to as  mini majors   From 1998 through 2005  DreamWorks SKG commanded a large enough market share to arguably qualify it as a seventh major  despite its relatively small output  In 2006  DreamWorks was acquired by Viacom  Paramount s corporate parent  In late 2008  DreamWorks once again became an independent production company  its films are distributed by Touchstone Pictures  The major studios are today primarily backers and distributors of films whose actual production is largely handled by independent companies either long running entities or ones created for and dedicated to the making of a specific film  The specialty divisions often simply acquire distribution rights to pictures with which the studio has had no prior involvement  While the majors do a modicum of true production  their activities are focused more in the areas of development  financing  marketing  and merchandising  Contents 1 Today s Big Six 2 The  mini majors  2 1 The studios 2 2 The standings 3 History 3 1 The majors before the Golden Age 3 2 The majors during the Golden Age 3 3

North American movie studio based outside of the Los Angeles metropolitan area before its relocation  Now known as Lionsgate  it was founded in 1997 by financier Frank Giustra  2   The company is unrelated to Lion s Gate Films  the Los Angeles based production company run by filmmaker Robert Altman in the 1970s   3  In 2003  the company doubled in size with the acquisition of Artisan Entertainment  4  In January 2012  Lionsgate acquired Summit Entertainment  which was the highest grossing mini major the previous three years  5  Summit was founded as an independent overseas sales company in 1991  moved into production in the mid 1990s  and was reconstituted as a full fledged studio in 2006  6  It saw its first major success with Twilight in autumn 2008  followed shortly after by its first Oscar winning production  The Hurt Locker  Through its acquisition of Summit  Lionsgate added the highly profitable Twilight franchise to its Saw and Tyler Perry franchises  7  Lionsgate also owns a minority stake in the independent distribution company Roadside Attractions  8  The Weinstein Company was founded in late 2005 by brothers Harvey and Bob Weinstein after their departure from Miramax  which they had founded in 1979  In 1993  they sold control of Miramax to the Walt Disney Company  continuing to run the studio in quasi independent fashion under the Disney umbrella  When the Weinsteins left Disney  they retained the right to the Dimension Films brand  which is used by The Weinstein Company  as it was by Miramax  for genre films  After the success of 1408  released in June 2007  the studio went two years without a hit  9  It experienced several high level executive defections in 2008  and announced major layoffs that November  10  The Weinsteins have a long standing relationship with Quentin Tarantino all of the feature films he has directed through 2009 have been distributed either by Miramax  when it was led by the brothers  or The Weinstein Company  The successful release of his Inglourious Basterds in August 2009 was seen as a  turnaround  for the studio  11  MGM  after decades as a major studio  continues to distribute motion pictures and television content as a minor  privately held media company  In April 2005  it was purchased from Kirk Kerkorian s Tracinda Corporation by a consortium including Sony  cable company Comcast  Providence Equity Partners  and three other private investment firms  While Sony continues to hold a minority equity stake in the company  MGM has a deal with 20th Century Fox for the distribution of home video and overseas theatrical product  12  MGM is also the majority shareholder of the latest incarnation of United Artists  whose other lead owners are Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner  Via its original 1981 merger with UA  MGM controls the rights to the James Bond franchise  Columbia codistributed the first two Bond films starring Daniel Craig after the 2005 purchase  13  After a third Bond film with Craig was put on hold when MGM slipped into deep financial trouble  Sony reached an agreement with MGM in April 2011 to distribute the next entry in the series  14  DreamWorks was founded in 1994 by Steven Spielberg  Jeffrey Katzenberg  and David Geffen  Once again independent after two and a half years under the Viacom Paramount corporate umbrella  it is now backed by India s Reliance ADA Group  15  DreamWorks will not be a full service studio it will produce and finance films  but as it did for most of its first era as an independent  it will arrange distribution through the majors  In February 2009  after dropping out of a deal with Universal  DreamWorks struck such a deal with Disney  though Paramount will be releasing the DreamWorks pictures developed there through mid 2011  16  The first independent DreamWorks film to be released under the new deal  via Touchstone  was I Am Number Four in February 2011  Katzenberg  who is completely divested from the new DreamWorks  now runs DreamWorks Animation as a totally separate business  The company maintains a close knit distribution deal with Paramount that runs through 2012  17  In 2007  CBS Corporation started a new movie division  CBS Films  focusing on star driven projects with midrange budgets of  50 million or less  18  The company released its first film  Extraordinary Measures  in January 2010  19   edit  The standings In 2011  a record five mini majors each pulled in more than 1  of the total domestic box office  Summit s  415 2 million in grosses and 4 1  market share put it atop the mini majors for the third straight year  Weinstein and its Dimension subsidiary together pulled in  291 8 million  a 2 9  share  Relativity was third with  228 3 million and 2 2   Lionsgate was fourth with  183 4 million and 1 8   and FilmDistrict was fifth with  126 1 million and 1 2   In 2010  Summit led with  519 9 million in grosses and a 5 0  market share  Lionsgate was close behind with  513 9 million in grosses  good for a 4 9  share  They were far ahead of the other mini majors  none of which reached  100 million in grosses or a 1  share  20  In 2009  Summit s mini major leading figures were  480 4 million in grosses and a 4 5  market share  Lionsgate s  401 5 million in grosses gave it a 3 8  share  Two other companies commanded market shares greater than 1   Weinstein Dimension  2 0   and Overture Films  1 5    21  In 2008  Lionsgate topped the mini majors with  441 5 million in grosses  a 4 5  market share  Three other companies had over  100 million in box office grosses  Summit  2 4  market share   MGM UA  1 7  market share   and Overture  1 1  market share   22  In 2007  Lionsgate and MGM UA were virtually tied for the position of most successful mini major in terms of market share  each with 3 8   No other independent studio had even a 1  market share  23  In 2006  Lionsgate had a 3 6  market share  The Weinstein Company had a 2 5  market share  and MGM UA had a 1 8  market share  24  In 2005  the still independent DreamWorks SKG had 5 7  and Lionsgate had 3 2   Of MGM UA s four significant money earners during 2005  it released three before its acquisition by the Sony led consortium  MGM UA s total market share for the year was 2 1   The Weinstein Company  in its first three months of operation  gained 0 5  of the year s total market share  25  In 2004  DreamWorks SKG had 10 0   more than the Paramount Motion Pictures Group   Newmarket had 4 3   due almost entirely to The Passion of the Christ   Lionsgate had 3 2   and MGM UA had 2 1   26   edit  History  edit  The majors before the Golden Age In 1909  Thomas Edison  who had been fighting in the courts for years for control of fundamental motion picture patents  won a major decision  This led to the creation of the Motion Picture Patents Company  widely known as the Trust  Comprising the nine largest U S  film companies  it was  designed to eliminate not only independent film producers but also the country s 10 000 independent  distribution  exchanges and exhibitors   27  Though its many members did not consolidate their filmmaking operations  the New York based Trust was arguably the first major North American movie conglomerate  The independents  fight against the Trust was led by Carl Laemmle  whose Chicago based Laemmle Film Service  serving the Midwest and Canada  was the largest distribution exchange in North America  Laemmle s efforts were rewarded in 1912 when the U S  government ruled that the Trust was a  corrupt and unlawful association  and must be dissolved  On June 8  1912  Laemmle organized the merger of his production division  IMP  Independent Motion Picture Company   with several other filmmaking companies  creating the studio that would soon be named Universal  By the end of the year  Universal was making movies at two Los Angeles facilities  the former Nestor Film studio in Hollywood  and another studio in Edendale  The first Hollywood major was in business  28  In 1916  a second powerful Hollywood studio was established when Adolph Zukor merged his Famous Players movie production house with the Jesse L  Lasky Company to form Famous Players Lasky  The combined studio acquired Paramount Pictures as a distribution arm and eventually adopted its name  Paramount quickly surpassed Universal as Hollywood s dominant company  In 1916 as well  William Fox relocated his Fox Film Corporation from the East Coast to Hollywood and began expanding  29  Between 1924  when Metro Pictures combined with Goldwyn Pictures and Louis B  Mayer Productions to form MGM  Metro Goldwyn Mayer   and 1928  the year in which the U S  film industry converted en masse to sound film  Hollywood had a Big Two  Paramount and Loew s Incorporated  owner of America s largest theater circuit and parent company to MGM  Through 1927  the next three largest studios were Fox  Universal  and First National  founded in 1917   Propelled by the great success of The Jazz Singer  1927   the first important feature length  talkie   small Warner Bros   founded in 1919  quickly entered the big leagues and acquired First National in 1928  Fox  in the forefront of sound film along with Warners  was also acquiring a sizable circuit of movie theaters to exhibit its product   edit  The majors during the Golden Age For more details on this topic  see Studio system  Between late 1928  when RCA s David Sarnoff engineered the creation of the RKO  Radio Keith Orpheum  studio  and the end of 1949  when Paramount divested its theater chain roughly the period considered Hollywood s Golden Age there were eight Hollywood studios commonly regarded as the  majors   Of these eight  the so called Big Five were integrated conglomerates  combining ownership of a production studio  distribution division  and substantial theater chain  and contracting with performers and filmmaking personnel  Loew s MGM  Paramount  Fox  which became 20th Century Fox after a 1935 merger   Warner Bros   and RKO  The remaining majors were sometimes referred to as the Little Three or the  major minors   Two Universal and Columbia  founded in 1919  were organized similarly to the Big Five  except for the fact that they never owned more than small theater circuits  a consistently reliable source of profits   The third of the lesser majors  United Artists  founded in 1919   owned a few theaters and had access to production facilities owned by its principals  but it functioned primarily as a backer distributor  loaning money to independent producers and releasing their films  During the 1930s  the eight majors averaged a total of 358 feature film releases a year  in the 1940s  the four largest companies shifted more of their resources toward high budget productions and away from B movies  bringing the yearly average down to 288 for the decade  30  Among the significant characteristics of the Golden Age was the stability of the Hollywood majors  their hierarchy  and their near complete domination of the box office  At the midpoint of the Golden Age  1939  the Big Five had market shares ranging from 22   MGM  to 9   RKO   each of the Little Three had around a 7  share  In sum  the eight majors controlled 95  of the market and all the smaller companies combined had a total of 5   Ten years later  the picture was largely the same  the Big Five had market shares ranging from 22   MGM  to 9   RKO   the Little Three had shares ranging from 8   Columbia  to 4   United Artists   In sum  the eight majors controlled 96  of the market and all the smaller companies combined had a total of 4   31   edit  The majors after the Golden Age  edit  1950s 1960s The end of the Golden Age had been signaled by the majors  loss of a federal antitrust case that led to the divestiture of the Big Five s theater chains  Though this had virtually no immediate effect on the eight majors  box office domination  it somewhat leveled the playing field between the Big Five and the Little Three  In November 1951  Decca Records purchased 28  of Universal  early the following year  the studio became the first of the classic Hollywood majors to be taken over by an outside corporation  as Decca acquired majority ownership  32  The 1950s saw two substantial shifts in the hierarchy of the majors  RKO  perennially the weakest of the Big Five  declined rapidly under the mismanagement of Howard Hughes  who had purchased a controlling interest in the studio in 1948  By the time Hughes sold it to the General Tire and Rubber Company in 1955  the studio was a major by outdated reputation alone  In 1957  virtually all RKO movie operations ceased and the studio was dissolved in 1959   Revived on a small scale in 1981  it was eventually spun off and now operates as a minor independent company   In contrast  there was United Artists  which had long operated under the financing distribution model the other majors were now progressively shifting toward  Under Arthur Krim and Robert Benjamin  who began managing the company in 1951  UA became consistently profitable  By 1956 when it released one of the biggest blockbusters of the decade  Around the World in 80 Days it commanded a 10  market share  By the middle of the next decade  it had reached 16  and was the second most profitable studio in Hollywood  Despite RKO s collapse  the majors still averaged a total yearly release slate of 253 feature films during the decade  30  The 1960s were marked by a spate of corporate takeovers  MCA  under Lew Wasserman  acquired Universal in 1962  Gulf Western took over Paramount in 1966  and the Transamerica Corporation purchased United Artists in 1967  Warner Bros  underwent large scale reorganization twice in two years  a 1967 merger with the Seven Arts company preceded a 1969 purchase by Kinney National  under Stephen J  Ross  MGM  in the process of a slow decline  changed ownership twice in the same span as well  winding up in the hands of financier Kirk Kerkorian  The majors almost entirely abandoned low budget production during this era  bringing the annual average of features released down to 160  30  The decade also saw an old name in the industry secure a position as a leading player  In 1923  Walt Disney had founded the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio with his brother Roy and animator Ub Iwerks  Over the following three decades Disney became a powerful independent focusing on animation and  from the late 1940s  an increasing number of live action movies  In 1954  the company now Walt Disney Productions established Buena Vista Film Distribution to handle its own product  which had been distributed for years by various majors  primarily United Artists and then RKO   Disney s 1937 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs  released by RKO  was the second biggest hit of the 1930s   In its first year  Buena Vista had a major success with 20 000 Leagues Under the Sea  the third biggest movie of 1954  In 1964  Buena Vista had its first blockbuster  Mary Poppins  Hollywood s biggest hit in half a decade  The company achieved a 9  market share that year  more than Fox and Warner Bros  Though over the next two decades  Disney Buena Vista s share of the box office would again hit similar marks  its relatively small output and exclusive focus on family movies meant that it was not generally considered a major   edit  1970s 1980s The early 1970s were difficult years for all the majors  Movie attendance  which had been declining steadily since the Golden Age  hit an all time low in 1971  In 1973  MGM president James T  Aubrey Jr  drastically downsized the studio  slashing its production schedule and eliminating its distribution arm  UA would distribute the studio s films for the remainder of the decade   From fifteen releases in 1973  the next year MGM was down to five  its average for the rest of the 1970s would be even lower  33  Like RKO in its last days under Hughes  MGM remained a major in terms of brand reputation  but little more  MGM  however  was not the only studio to trim its release line  By the mid 1970s  the industry had rebounded and a significant philosophical shift was in progress  As the majors focused increasingly on the development of the next hoped for blockbuster and began routinely opening each new movie in many hundreds of theaters  an approach called  saturation booking    their collective yearly release average fell to 81 films during 1975 84  30  The classic set of majors was shaken further in late 1980  when the disastrously expensive flop of Heaven s Gate effectively ruined United Artists  The studio was sold the following year to Kerkorian  who merged it with MGM  After a brief resurgence  the combined studio again declined  From the mid 1980s on  MGM UA has been at best a  mini major   to use the present day term  Meanwhile  a new member was finally admitted to the club of major studios and two significant contenders emerged  With the establishment of its Touchstone Pictures brand and increasing attention to the adult market in the mid 1980s  Disney Buena Vista secured acknowledgment as a full fledged major  Film historian Joel Finler identifies 1986 as the breakthrough year  when Disney rose to third place in market share and remained consistently competitive for a leading position thereafter  34  The two contenders were both newly formed companies  In 1978  Krim  Benjamin  and three other studio executives departed UA to found Orion Pictures as a joint venture with Warner Bros  It was announced optimistically as the  first major new film company in 50 years   35 Tri Star Pictures was created in 1982 as a joint venture of Columbia Pictures  then owned by the Coca Cola Company   HBO  then owned by Time Inc    and CBS  In 1985  Rupert Murdoch s News Corporation acquired 20th Century Fox  the last of the five relatively healthy Golden Age majors to remain independent throughout the entire Golden Age and after  In 1986  the combined share of the six classic majors at that point Paramount  Warner Bros   Columbia  Universal  Fox  and MGM UA fell to 64   the lowest since the beginning of the Golden Age  Disney was in third place  behind only Paramount and Warners  Even including it as a seventh major and adding its 10  share  the majors  control of the North American market was at a historic ebb  Orion  now completely independent of Warner Bros   and Tri Star were well positioned as mini majors  each with North American market shares of around 6  and regarded by industry observers as  fully competitive with the majors   36  Smaller independents garnered 13  more than any studio aside from Paramount  In 1964  by comparison  all of the companies beside the then seven majors and Disney had combined for a grand total of 1   In the first edition of Finler s The Hollywood Story  1988   he wrote   It will be interesting to see whether the old established studios will be able to bounce back in the future  as they have done so many times before  or whether the newest developments really do reflect a fundamental change in the US movie industry for the first times since the 20s   37   edit  1990s present With the exception of MGM UA whose position was effectively filled by Disney the old established studios did bounce back  The purchase of Fox by Murdoch s News Corp  presaged a new round of corporate acquisitions  Between 1989 and 1994  Paramount  Warners  Columbia  and Universal all changed ownership in a series of conglomerate purchases and mergers that brought them new financial and marketing muscle  Paramount s parent company Gulf   Western was renamed Paramount Communications in 1989 and was merged with Viacom five years later  Warners merged with Time Inc  to give birth to the conglomerate Time Warner  Coke sold Columbia to Japanese electronics firm Sony also in 1989  And Universal s parent MCA was purchased by Matsushita  By the early 1990s  both Tri Star and Orion were essentially out of business  the former consolidated into Columbia  the latter bankrupt and sold to MGM  The most important contenders to emerge during the 1990s  New Line  the Weinsteins  Miramax  and DreamWorks SKG  were likewise sooner or later brought into the majors  fold  though DreamWorks and the Weinstein brothers are now independent again  The development of in house pseudo indie subsidiaries by the conglomerates sparked by the 1992 establishment of Sony Pictures Classics and the success of Pulp Fiction  1994   Miramax s first project under Disney ownership significantly undermined the position of the true independents  The majors  release schedule rebounded  the six primary studio subsidiaries alone put out a total of 124 films during 2006  the three largest secondary subsidiaries  New Line  Fox Searchlight  Focus Features  accounted for another 30  Box office domination was fully restored  in 2006  the six major movie conglomerates combined for 89 8  of the North American market  Lionsgate and Weinstein were almost exactly half as successful as their 1986 mini major counterparts  sharing 6 1   MGM came in at 1 8   and all of the remaining independent companies split a pool totalling 2 3   38  Only one of the major studios changed corporate hands during the first decade of the 2000s  though it did so twice  Universal was acquired by Vivendi in 2000  and then by General Electric four years later  More developments took place among the majors  subsidiaries  The very successful animation production house Pixar  whose films were distributed by Buena Vista  was acquired by Disney in 2006  In 2008  New Line Cinema lost its independent status within Time Warner and became a subsidiary of Warner Bros  Time Warner also announced that it would be shutting down its two specialty units  Warner Independent and Picturehouse  39  In 2008 as well  Paramount Vantage s production  marketing  and distribution departments were folded into the parent studio  40  though it retained the brand for release purposes  41  42  Universal sold off its genre specialty division  Rogue Pictures  to Relativity Media in 2009  43  Disney closed down Miramax s operations in January 2010  44  and sold off the unit and its library that July to an investor group led by Ronald N  Tutor of the Tutor Perini construction firm and Tom Barrack of the Colony Capital
