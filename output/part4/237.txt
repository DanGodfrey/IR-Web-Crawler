their nationality with ethnicity  but with citizenship  Aside from the Native American population  nearly all Americans or their ancestors immigrated within the past five centuries  23  Despite its multi ethnic composition 24  25   the culture held in common by most Americans is referred to as mainstream American culture  a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of Western European immigrants  24  It also includes influences of African American culture  26  Westward expansion integrated the Creoles and Cajuns of Louisiana and the Hispanos of the Southwest and brought close contact with the culture of Mexico  Large scale immigration in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries from Southern and Eastern Europe introduced a variety of elements  Immigration from Asia  Africa  and Latin America has also had impact  A cultural melting pot  or pluralistic salad bowl  describes the way in which generations of Americans have celebrated and exchanged distinctive cultural characteristics  24  In addition to the United States  Americans and people of American descent can be found internationally  As many as 4 million Americans are estimated to be living abroad

African American and Black Hispanic and Latino Americans African Americans  also referred to as Black Americans or Afro Americans  and formerly as American Negroes  are citizens or residents of the

although some are or are descended from immigrants from African  Caribbean  Central American or South American nations  40  As an adjective  the term is usually spelled African American  41  More recent immigrants from Africa may  or may not  self identify as  African American   42  43  and may experience conflict with American born African Americans  44  45  46  47  African American history starts in the 17th century with indentured servitude in the American colonies and progresses onto the election of Barack Obama as the 44th and current President of the United States  Between those landmarks there were other events and issues  both resolved and ongoing  that were faced by African Americans  Some of these were slavery  reconstruction  development of the African American community

sub groups are immigrants or descendants of immigrants from Cambodia  Mainland China  India  Japan  Korea  Laos  Pakistan  the Philippines  the island of Taiwan  Thailand  and Vietnam  Asians overall have higher income levels than all other racial groups in the United States  including whites  and the trend appears to be increasing in relation to those groups  55  Additionally  Asians have a higher education attainment level than all other racial groups in the United States  56  57  For better or worse  the group has been called a model minority  58  59  60  While Asian American have been

and Alaska Natives Indigenous peoples of the Americas  such as American Indians and Inuit  made up 0 8  of the population in 2008  numbering 2 4 million  52  An additional 2 3 million declared part American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry  70  The legal and official designation of who is Native American by descent aroused controversy by demographers  tribal nations and government officials for many decades  The blood quantum laws are complex and contradictory in admittance of new tribal members  or for census takers to accept any respondent s claims without official documents from the US Bureau of Indian Affairs  Genetic scientists estimated that over 15 million other Americans may be one quarter or less of American Indian descent  Once thought to face extinction in race or culture  there has been a remarkable revival of Native American identity and tribal sovereignty in the 20th century  The Cherokee are at 800 000 full or part blood degrees  70 000 Cherokee live in Oklahoma in the Cherokee Nation  and 15 000 in North Carolina on remnants of their ancestral homelands  The second largest tribal group is the Navajo  who call themselves  Din   and live on a 16 million acre  65 000 km   Indian reservation covering northeast Arizona  northwest New Mexico  and southeast Utah  It is home to half of the 450 000 Navajo Nation members  The third largest group are the Lakota  Sioux  Nation located in the states of Minnesota  Montana  Nebraska  Wyoming  and North and South Dakota   edit  Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders numbered 427 810 in 2008  or 0 14  of the population  52  Additionally  nearly as many report partial Native Hawaiian ancestry  for a total of 829 949 people of full or part Native Hawaiian ancestry  71  This group constitutes the smallest minority race in the United States  Although the numbers show that just more than half are  full blooded   most Native Hawaiians on the island chain of Hawaii are said to be highly mixed with Asian  European and other ancestries  Only 1 out of 50 Native Hawaiians can be legally defined as  full blood  and some demographers believe that by the year 2025  the last full blooded Native Hawaiian will die off  leaving a culturally distinct  but racially mixed population  However  there is more individual self designation of Native Hawaiian than before the US annexed the islands in 1898  Native Hawaiians are receiving ancestral land reparations  Throughout Hawaii  the preservation and universal adaptation of Native Hawaiian customs  Hawaiian language  cultural schools solely for legally Native Hawaiian students  and historical awareness has gained momentum for Native Hawaiians   edit  National personification  Uncle Sam  is a national personification of the United States  The image bears resemblance to the real Samuel Wilson  The female personification is  Columbia   A national personification is an anthropomorphization of a nation or its people  it can appear in both editorial cartoons and propaganda  Uncle Sam is a national personification of the United States and sometimes more specifically of the American government  with the first usage of the term dating from the War of 1812  He is depicted as a stern elderly white man with white hair and a goatee beard  and dressed in clothing that recalls the design elements of flag of the United States   for example  typically a top hat with red and white stripes and white stars on a blue band  and red and white striped trousers  Columbia is a poetic name for the Americas and the feminine personification of the United States of America  made famous by African American poet Phillis Wheatley during the American Revolutionary War in 1776  It has inspired the names of many persons  places  objects  institutions  and companies in the Western Hemisphere and beyond   edit  Language Main articles  English language  American English  and English only movement Languages  2007

taught second language  72  73  Some Americans advocate making English the country s official language  as it is in at least twenty eight states  74  Both Hawaiian and English are official languages in Hawaii by state law  75  While neither has an official language  New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish  as Louisiana does for English and French  76  Other states  such as California  mandate the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents including court forms  77  Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native

largest temple of the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints Touro Synagogue  built in 1759 in Newport  Rhode Island  America s oldest surviving synagogue Religion in the United States has a high adherence level  compared to other developed countries  and diversity in beliefs  The First Amendment to the country s Constitution prevents the Federal government from making any  law respecting an establishment of religion   and guarantees the free exercise of religion  The Supreme Court has interpreted this as preventing the government from having any authority in religion  A majority of Americans report that religion plays a  very important  role in their lives  a proportion unusual among developed nations  although similar to the other nations of the Americas  78  Many faiths have flourished in the United States  including both later imports spanning the country s multicultural immigrant heritage  as well as those founded within the country  these have led the United States to become the most religiously diverse country in the world  79  The majority of Americans  76   identify themselves as Christians  mostly within Protestant and Catholic denominations  accounting for 51  and 25  of the population respectively  80  Non Christian religions  including Buddhism  Hinduism  Islam  and Judaism   collectively make up about 4  to 5  of the adult population  80  81  82  Another 15  of the adult population identifies as having no religious belief or no religious affiliation  80  According to the American Religious Identification Survey  religious belief varies considerably across the country  59  of Americans living in Western states  the  Unchurched Belt   report a belief in God  yet in the South  the  Bible Belt   the figure is as high as 86   80  83  Several of the original Thirteen Colonies were established by settlers who wished to practice their own religion without discrimination  the Massachusetts Bay Colony was established by English Puritans  Pennsylvania by Irish and English Quakers  Maryland by English and Irish Catholics  and Virginia by English Anglicans  Although some individual states retained established religious confessions well into the nineteenth century  the United States was the first nation to have no official state endorsed religion  84  Modeling the provisions concerning religion within the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom  the framers of the Constitution rejected any religious test for office  and the First Amendment specifically denied the federal government any power to enact any law respecting either an establishment of religion or prohibiting its free exercise  thus protecting any religious organization  institution  or denomination from government interference  The decision was mainly influenced by European Rationalist and Protestant ideals  but was also a consequence of the pragmatic concerns of minority religious groups and small states that did not want to be under the power or influence of a national religion that did not represent them  85   edit  Culture Main article  Culture of the United States The development of the culture of the United States of America has been marked by a tension between two strong sources of inspiration  European ideals  especially British  and domestic originality  such as Jeffersonian democracy  Thomas Jefferson s Notes on the State of Virginia was perhaps the first influential domestic cultural critique by an American  American culture encompasses traditions  ideals  customs  beliefs  values  arts  folklore and innovations developed both domestically and imported via colonization and immigration from the British Isles  Prevalent ideas and ideals which evolved domestically such as important national holidays  uniquely American sports  proud military tradition  and innovations in the arts and entertainment give a strong sense of national pride among the population as a whole  American Shepherd with his horse and dog   edit  See also
