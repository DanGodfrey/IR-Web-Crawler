constitutionally socialist state that existed in Eurasia between 1922 and 1991  The Soviet Union was a single party state ruled by the Communist Party from its foundation until 1990  1  A federal 2 union of 15 subnational Soviet republics  the Soviet state was structured under a highly centralized government and economy  The Russian Revolution of 1917 caused the downfall of the Russian Empire  Following the Russian Revolution  there was a struggle for power between the Bolshevik party  led by Vladimir Lenin  and the anti communist White movement  In December 1922  the Bolsheviks won the civil war  and the Soviet Union was formed with the merger of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic  the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic  the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic  Following the death of Vladimir Lenin in 1924  Joseph Stalin took power  3  leading the USSR through a large scale industrialization program  Stalin established a planned economy and suppressed political opposition to him and the Communist party  3  In June 1941  Nazi Germany and its allies invaded the Soviet Union  breaking the non aggression pact  which the latter had signed in 1939  After four years of brutal warfare  the Soviet Union emerged victorious as one of the world s two superpowers  the other being the United States  The Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellite states engaged in the Cold War  a prolonged global ideological and political struggle against the United States and its Western Bloc allies  which it ultimately abandoned in the face of economic troubles and both domestic and foreign political unrest  4  5  In the late 1980s  the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev tried to reform the state with his policies of perestroika and glasnost  but the Soviet Union collapsed and was formally dissolved in December 1991 after the abortive August coup attempt  6  The Russian Federation assumed its

the world s largest state  Covering a sixth of the Earth s land surface  its size was comparable to that of North America  The European portion accounted for a quarter of the country s area  and was the cultural and economic center  The eastern part in Asia extended to the Pacific Ocean to the east and Afghanistan to the south  and was much less populous  It spanned over 10 000 kilometres  6 200 mi  east to west across 11 time zones  and almost 7 200 kilometres  4 500 mi  north to south  It had five climate zones  tundra  taiga  steppes  desert  and mountains  The Soviet Union had the world s longest border  measuring over 60 000 kilometres  37 000 mi   two thirds of it a coastline of the Arctic Ocean  Across the Bering Strait was the United States  The Soviet Union bordered Afghanistan  China  Czechoslovakia  Finland  Hungary  Iran  Mongolia  North Korea  Norway  Poland  Romania  and Turkey from 1945 to 1991  The Soviet Union s longest river was the Irtysh  Its highest mountain was Communism Peak  now Ismail Samani Peak  in Tajikistan  at 7 495 metres  24 590 ft   The world s largest lake  the Caspian Sea  lay mainly within the Soviet Union  The world s largest freshwater and deepest lake  Lake Baikal  was in the Soviet Union  History Main article  History of the Soviet Union The last Russian Tsar  Nicholas II  ruled the Russian Empire until his abdication in March 1917  due in part to the strain of fighting in World War I  A short lived Russian provisional government took power  to be overthrown in the 1917 October Revolution  N S  November 1917  by revolutionaries led by the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin  The Soviet Union was officially established in December 1922 with the union of the Russian  Ukrainian  Byelorussian  and Transcaucasian Soviet republics  each ruled by local Bolshevik parties  Despite the foundation of the Soviet state as a federative entity of many constituent republics  each with its own political and administrative entities  the term  Soviet Russia    strictly applicable only to the Russian Federative Socialist Republic   was often incorrectly applied to the entire country by non Soviet writers and politicians  Revolution and foundation Main articles  History of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union  1917 1927   Russian Revolution  1917   February Revolution  Russian Provisional Government  October Revolution  and Russian Civil War Modern revolutionary activity in the Russian Empire began with the Decembrist Revolt of 1825  Although serfdom was abolished in 1861  it was done on terms unfavorable to the peasants and served to encourage revolutionaries  A parliament the State Duma was established in 1906 after the Russian Revolution of 1905  but the Tsar resisted attempts to move from absolute to constitutional monarchy  Social unrest continued and was aggravated during World War I by military defeat and food shortages in major cities  Vladimir Lenin addressing a crowd in 1920  A spontaneous popular uprising in Saint Petersburg  in response to the wartime decay of Russia s economy and morale  culminated in the February Revolution and the toppling of the imperial government in March 1917  The tsarist autocracy was replaced by the Russian Provisional Government  which intended to conduct elections to the Russian Constituent Assembly and to continue fighting on the side of the Entente in World War I  At the same time  workers  councils  known as Soviets  sprang up across the country  The Bolsheviks  led by Vladimir Lenin  pushed for socialist revolution in the Soviets and on the streets  In November 1917  during the October Revolution  they seized power  In December  the Bolsheviks signed an armistice with the Central Powers  though by February 1918  fighting had resumed  In March  the Soviets quit the war for good and signed the Treaty of Brest Litovsk  A long and bloody Russian Civil War ensued between the Reds and the Whites  starting in 1917 and ending in 1923 with the Reds victorious  It included foreign intervention  the execution of Nicholas II and his family  and the famine of 1921  which killed about five million  8  In March 1921  during a related conflict with Poland  the Peace of Riga was signed  splitting disputed territories in Belarus and Ukraine between the Republic of Poland and Soviet Russia  The Soviet Union had to resolve similar conflicts with the newly established Republic of Finland  the Republic of Estonia  the Republic of Latvia  and the Republic of Lithuania  Unification of republics On 28 December 1922  a conference of plenipotentiary delegations from the Russian SFSR  the Transcaucasian SFSR  the Ukrainian SSR and the Byelorussian SSR approved the Treaty of Creation of the USSR 9  and the Declaration of the Creation of the USSR  forming the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  10  These two documents were confirmed by the 1st Congress of Soviets of the USSR and signed by the heads of the delegations  11 Mikhail Kalinin  Mikha Tskhakaya  Mikhail Frunze  Grigory Petrovsky  and Aleksandr Chervyakov  12  on 30 December 1922  On 1 February 1924  the USSR was recognized by the British Empire  The same year  a Soviet Constitution was approved  legitimizing the December 1922 union  An intensive restructuring of the economy  industry and politics of the country began in the early days of Soviet power in 1917  A large part of this was done according to the Bolshevik Initial Decrees  government documents signed by Vladimir Lenin  One of the most prominent breakthroughs was the GOELRO plan  which envisioned a major restructuring of the Soviet economy based on total electrification of the country  The plan was developed in 1920 and covered a 10 to 15 year period  It included construction of a network of 30 regional power plants  including ten large hydroelectric power plants  and numerous electric powered large industrial enterprises  13  The plan became the prototype for subsequent Five Year Plans and was fulfilled by 1931  14  Stalin era Main article  History of the Soviet Union  1927 1953  Stalin and Nikolai Yezhov  the head of the NKVD  After Yezhov was executed he was edited out of this image  From its beginning  the government in the Soviet Union was based on the one party rule of the Communist Party  Bolsheviks   15  After the economic policy of War Communism during the Russian Civil War  the Soviet government permitted some private enterprise to coexist alongside nationalized industry in the 1920s and total food requisition in the countryside was replaced by a food tax  see New Economic Policy   Soviet leaders argued that one party rule was necessary to ensure that  capitalist exploitation  would not return to the Soviet Union and that the principles of Democratic Centralism would represent the people s will  Debate over the future of the economy provided the background for a power struggle in the years after Lenin s death in 1924  Initially  Lenin was to be replaced by a  troika  consisting of Grigory Zinoviev of Ukraine  Lev Kamenev of Moscow  and Joseph Stalin of Georgia  On 3 April 1922  Stalin was named the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  Lenin had appointed Stalin the head of the Workers  and Peasants  Inspectorate  which gave Stalin considerable power  By gradually consolidating his influence and isolating and out maneuvering his rivals within the party  Stalin became the undisputed leader of the Soviet Union and  by the end of the 1920s  established totalitarian rule  In October 1927  Grigory Zinoviev and Leon Trotsky were expelled from the Central Committee and forced into exile  In 1928  Stalin introduced the First Five Year Plan for building a socialist economy  While encompassing the internationalism expressed by Lenin throughout the Revolution  it also aimed to build socialism in one country  In industry  the state assumed control over all existing enterprises and undertook an intensive program of industrialization  In agriculture  collective farms were established all over the country  Famines ensued  causing millions of deaths  surviving kulaks were persecuted and many sent to Gulags to do forced labour  16  Social upheaval continued in the mid 1930s  Stalin s Great Purge resulted in the execution or detainment of many  Old Bolsheviks  who had participated in the October Revolution with Lenin  According to declassified Soviet archives  in 1937 and 1938  the NKVD arrested more than one and a half million people  of whom 681 692 were shot   an average of 1 000 executions a day  17  The excess deaths during the 1930s as a whole were in the range of 10 11 million  18  Yet despite the turmoil of the mid to late 1930s  the Soviet Union developed a powerful industrial economy in the years before World War II  The 1930s The early 1930s saw closer cooperation between the West and the USSR  From 1932 to 1934  the Soviet Union participated in the World Disarmament Conference  In 1933  diplomatic relations between the United States and the USSR were established  In September 1934  the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations  After the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936  the USSR actively supported the Republican forces against the Nationalists  who were supported by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany  In December 1936  Stalin unveiled a new Soviet Constitution  The constitution was seen as a personal triumph for Stalin  who on this occasion was described by Pravda as a  genius of the new world  the wisest man of the epoch  the great leader of communism   By contrast  western historians and historians from former Soviet occupied countries have viewed the constitution as a meaningless propaganda document  The late 1930s saw a shift towards the Axis powers  In 1938  after the United Kingdom and France had concluded the Munich Agreement with Germany  the USSR dealt with the Nazis as well  both militarily and economically during extensive talks  The two countries concluded the German Soviet Nonaggression Pact and the German Soviet Commercial Agreement  The nonaggression pact made possible Soviet occupation of Lithuania  Latvia  Estonia  Bessarabia  northern Bukovina  and eastern Poland  In late November of the same year  unable to coerce the Republic of Finland by diplomatic means into moving its border 25 kilometres  16 mi  back from Leningrad  Joseph Stalin ordered the invasion of Finland  In the east  the Soviet military won several decisive victories during border clashes with the Japanese Empire in 1938 and 1939  However  in April 1941  USSR signed the Soviet Japanese Neutrality Pact with the Empire of Japan  recognizing the territorial integrity of Manchukuo  a Japanese puppet state  World War II Soviet soldiers in Berlin  May 1945  Main article  Eastern Front  World War II  Although it has been debated whether the Soviet Union intended to invade Germany once it was strong enough  19  Germany itself broke the treaty and invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941  starting what was known in the USSR as the  Great Patriotic War   The Red Army stopped the seemingly invincible German Army at the Battle of Moscow  aided by an unusually harsh winter  The Battle of Stalingrad  which lasted from late 1942 to early 1943  dealt a severe blow to the Germans from which they never fully recovered and became a turning point of the war  After Stalingrad  Soviet forces drove through Eastern Europe to Berlin before Germany surrendered in 1945  The German Army suffered 80  of its military deaths in the Eastern Front  20  Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin  U S  President Franklin D  Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill  left to right  confer in Tehran in 1943  The same year  the USSR  in fulfillment of its agreement with the Allies at the Yalta Conference  denounced the Soviet Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1945 21  and invaded Manchukuo and other Japan controlled territories on 9 August 1945  22 This conflict ended with a decisive Soviet victory  contributing to the unconditional surrender of Japan and the end of World War II  The Soviet Union suffered greatly in the war  losing around 27 million people  23  Despite this  it emerged as a superpower in the post war period  Once denied diplomatic recognition by the Western world  the Soviet Union had official relations with practically every nation by the late 1940s  A member of the United Nations at its foundation in 1945  the Soviet Union became one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council  which gave it the right to veto any of its resolutions  see Soviet Union and the United Nations   The Soviet Union maintained its status as one of the world s two superpowers for four decades through its hegemony in Eastern Europe  military strength  economic strength  aid to developing countries  and scientific research  especially in space technology and weaponry  Cold War Main article  Cold War During the immediate postwar period  the Soviet Union rebuilt and expanded its economy  while maintaining its strictly centralized control  It aided post war reconstruction in the countries of Eastern Europe  while turning them into satellite states  binding them in a military alliance  the Warsaw Pact  in 1955  and an economic organization  The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance or Comecon  from 1949 to 1991  the latter a counterpart to the European Economic Community  24  Later  the Comecon supplied aid to the eventually victorious Chinese Communist Party  and saw its influence grow elsewhere in the world  Fearing its ambitions  the Soviet Union s wartime allies  the United Kingdom and the United States  became its enemies  In the ensuing Cold War  the two sides clashed indirectly using mostly proxies  Khrushchev era Main article  History of the Soviet Union  1953 1964  The maximum territorial extent of countries in the world under Soviet influence  after the Cuban Revolution of 1959 and before the official Sino Soviet split of 1961 Stalin died on 5 March 1953  Without a mutually agreeable successor  the highest Communist Party officials opted to rule the Soviet Union jointly  Nikita Khrushchev  who had won the power struggle by the mid 1950s  denounced Stalin s use of repression in 1956 and eased repressive controls over party and society  This was known as de Stalinization  Moscow considered Eastern Europe to be a buffer zone for the forward defense of its western borders  and ensured its control of the region by transforming the East European countries into satellite states  Soviet military force was used to suppress anti communist uprisings in Hungary and Poland in 1956  In the late 1950s  a confrontation with China regarding the USSR s rapprochement with the West and what Mao Zedong perceived as Khrushchev s revisionism led to the Sino Soviet split  This resulted in a break throughout the global Communist movement  with Communist regimes in Albania  Cambodia and Somalia choosing to ally with China in place of the USSR  Lunokhod 1 rover landed on the moon on 17 November 1970 During this period  the Soviet Union continued to realize scientific and technological

cultural and economic life in the Soviet Union  That included some openness and contact with other nations and new social and economic policies with more emphasis on commodity goods  allowing living standards to rise dramatically while maintaining high levels of economic growth  Censorship was relaxed as well  Khrushchev s reforms in agriculture and administration  however  were generally unproductive  In 1962  he precipitated a crisis with the United States over the Soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba  The Soviet Union backed down after the United States initiated a naval blockade  causing Khrushchev much embarrassment and loss of prestige  He was removed from power in 1964  Brezhnev era Main article  History of the Soviet Union  1964 1982  Following the ousting of Khrushchev  another period of collective leadership ensued  consisting of Leonid Brezhnev as General Secretary  Alexei Kosygin as Premier and Nikolai Podgorny as Chairman of the Presidium  lasting until Brezhnev established himself in the early 1970s as the preeminent Soviet leader  In 1968 the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies invaded Czechoslovakia to halt the Prague Spring reforms  Leonid Brezhnev and Jimmy Carter sign SALT II treaty  18 June 1979  in Vienna  Brezhnev presided over a period of d tente with the West  see SALT I  SALT II  Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty  while at the same time building up Soviet military might  In October 1977  the third Soviet Constitution was unanimously adopted  The prevailing mood of the Soviet leadership at the time of Brezhnev s death in 1982 was one of aversion to change  The long period of Brezhnev s rule had come to be dubbed one of  standstill   with an aging and ossified top political leadership  Reforms and dissolution Main articles  Cold War  1985 1991   History of the Soviet Union  1982 1991   Dissolution of the Soviet Union  1991 Soviet coup d  tat attempt  and Commonwealth of Independent States Gorbachev in one to one discussions with U S  President Ronald Reagan  Two developments dominated the decade that followed  the increasingly apparent crumbling of the Soviet Union s economic and political structures  and the patchwork attempts at reforms to reverse that process  Kenneth S  Deffeyes argued in Beyond Oil that the Reagan administration encouraged Saudi Arabia to lower the price of oil to the point where the Soviets could not make a profit selling their oil  so that the USSR s hard currency reserves became depleted  26  Brezhnev s next two successors  transitional figures with deep roots in his tradition  did not last long  Yuri Andropov was 68 years old and Konstantin Chernenko 72 when they assumed power  both died in less than two years  In an attempt to avoid a third short lived leader  in 1985  the Soviets turned to the next generation and selected Mikhail Gorbachev  Gorbachev made significant changes in the economy and party leadership  called perestroika  His policy of glasnost freed public access to information after decades of heavy government censorship  Soviet troops withdrawing from Afghanistan in 1988 Gorbachev also moved to end the Cold War  In 1988  the Soviet Union abandoned its nine year war in Afghanistan and began to withdraw its forces  In the late 1980s  he refused military support to the Soviet Union s former satellite states  resulting in the toppling of multiple communist regimes  With the tearing down of the Berlin Wall and with East Germany and West Germany pursuing unification  the Iron Curtain came down  In the late 1980s  the constituent republics of the Soviet Union started legal moves towards potentially declaring sovereignty over their territories  citing Article 72 of the USSR constitution  which stated that any constituent republic was free to secede  27  On 7 April 1990  a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two thirds of its residents voted for it in a referendum  28  Many held their first free elections in the Soviet era for their own national legislatures in 1990  Many of these legislatures proceeded to produce legislation contradicting the Union laws in what was known as the  War of Laws   In 1989  the Russian SFSR  which was then the largest constituent republic  with about half of the population  convened a newly elected Congress of People s Deputies  Boris Yeltsin was elected its chairman  On 12 June 1990  the Congress declared Russia s sovereignty over its territory and proceeded to pass laws that attempted to supersede some of the USSR s laws  The period of legal uncertainty continued throughout 1991 as constituent republics slowly became de facto independent  A referendum for the preservation of the USSR was held on 17 March 1991  with the majority of the population voting for preservation of the Union in nine out of the 15 republics  The referendum gave Gorbachev a minor boost  In the summer of 1991  the New Union Treaty  which would have turned the Soviet Union into a much looser Union  was agreed upon by eight republics  Yeltsin stands on a tank to defy the August Coup in 1991  The signing of the treaty  however  was interrupted by the August Coup an attempted coup d  tat by hardline members of the government and the KGB who sought to reverse Gorbachev s reforms and reassert the central government s control over the republics  After the coup collapsed  Yeltsin was seen as a hero for his decisive actions  while Gorbachev s power was effectively ended  The balance of power tipped significantly towards the republics  In August 1991  Latvia and Estonia immediately declared the restoration of their full independence  following Lithuania s 1990 example   while the other twelve republics continued discussing new  increasingly looser  models of the Union  On 8 December 1991  the presidents of Russia  Ukraine and Belarus signed the Belavezha Accords  which declared the Soviet Union dissolved and established the Commonwealth of Independent States  CIS  in its place  While doubts remained over the authority of the accords to do this  on 21 December 1991  the representatives of all Soviet republics except Georgia signed the Alma Ata Protocol  which confirmed the accords  On 25 December 1991  Gorbachev yielded to the inevitable and resigned as the President of the USSR  declaring the office extinct  He turned the powers that had been vested in the presidency over to Yeltsin  the President of Russia  The following day  the Supreme Soviet  the highest governmental body of the Soviet Union  dissolved itself  This is generally recognized as marking the official  final dissolution of the Soviet Union as a functioning state  Many organizations  such as the Soviet Army and police forces  remained in place in the early months of 1992  but were slowly phased out and either withdrawn from or absorbed by the newly independent states  Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991  Russia was internationally recognized 29  as its legal successor on the international stage  To that end  Russia voluntarily accepted all Soviet foreign debt and claimed overseas Soviet properties as its own  Since then  the Russian Federation has assumed the Soviet Union s rights and obligations  Politics Main articles  Politics of the Soviet Union and State ideology of the Soviet Union There were three power hierarchies in the Soviet Union  the legislative branch represented by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union  the government represented by the Council of Ministers  and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  CPSU   the only legal party and the ultimate policymaker in the country  30  Communist Party Main article  Communist Party of the Soviet Union The 1983 annual military parade in Moscow  commemorating the 66th anniversary of the October Revolution  The banner at the top reads   Glory to the CPSU   At the top of the Communist Party was the Central Committee  elected at Party Congresses and Conferences  The Central Committee in turn voted for a Politburo  called the Presidium between 1952 1966   Secretariat and the General Secretary  First Secretary from 1953 to 1966   the highest office in the USSR  31  Depending on the degree of power consolidation  it was either the Politburo as a collective body or the General Secretary  who always was one of the Politburo members  that effectively led the party and the country 32   except for the period of the highly personalized authority of Stalin  exercised directly through his position in the Council of Ministers rather than the Politburo after 1941   33  They were not controlled by the general party membership  as the key principle of the party organization was democratic centralism  demanding strict subordination to higher bodies  and elections went uncontested  endorsing the candidates proposed from above  34  The Communist Party maintained its dominance over the state largely through its control over the system of appointments  All senior government officials and most deputies of the Supreme Soviet were members of the CPSU  Of the party heads themselves  Stalin in 1941 1953 and Khrushchev in 1958 1964 were Premiers  Upon the forced retirement of Khrushchev  the party leader was prohibited from this kind of double membership  35  but the later General Secretaries for at least some part of their tenure occupied the largely ceremonial position of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet  the nominal head of state  The institutions at lower levels were overseen and at times supplanted by primary party organizations  36  In practice  however  the degree of control the party was able to exercise over the state bureaucracy  particularly after the death of Stalin  was far from total  with the bureaucracy pursuing different interests that were at times in conflict with the party  37  Nor was the party itself monolithic from top to bottom  although factions were officially banned  38  Government The Grand Kremlin Palace  seat of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR  in 1982 Main article  Government of the Soviet Union The Supreme Soviet  successor of the Congress of Soviets and Central Executive Committee  was nominally the highest state body for most of the Soviet history  39  at first acting as a rubber stamp institution  approving and implementing all decisions made by the party  However  the powers and functions of the Supreme Soviet were extended in the late 1950s  1960s and 1970s  including the creation of new state commissions and committees  It gained additional powers when it came to the approval of the Five Year Plans and the Soviet state budget  40  The Supreme Soviet elected a Presidium to wield its power between plenary sessions  41  ordinarily held twice a year  and appointed the Supreme Court  42  the Procurator General 43  and the Council of Ministers  known before 1946 as the Council of People s Commissars   headed by the Chairman  Premier  and managing an enormous bureaucracy responsible for the administration of the economy and society  41  State and party structures of the constituent republics largely emulated the structure of the central institutions  although the Russian SFSR  unlike the other constituent republics  for most of its history had no republican branch of the CPSU  being ruled directly by the union wide party until 1990  Local authorities were organized likewise into party committees  local Soviets and executive committees  While the state system was nominally federal  the party was unitary  44  The state security police  the KGB and its predecessor agencies  played an important role in Soviet politics  It was instrumental in the Stalinist terror  45  but after the death of Stalin  the state security police was brought under strict party control  Under Yuri Andropov  KGB chairman in 1967 1982 and General Secretary from 1982 to 1983  the KGB engaged in the suppression of political dissent and maintained an extensive network of informers  reasserting itself as a political actor to some extent independent of the party state structure  46  culminating in the anti corruption campaign targeting high party officials in the late 1970s and early 1980s  47  Separation of power and reform Main article  Perestroika The Soviet constitutions  which were promulgated in 1918  1924  1936 and 1977  48  did not limit state power  No formal separation of powers existed between the Party  Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers  49  that represented executive and legislative branches of the government  The system was governed less by statute than by informal conventions  and no settled mechanism of leadership succession existed  Bitter and at times deadly power struggles took place in the Politburo after the deaths of Lenin 50  and Joseph Stalin  51  as well as after Khrushchev s dismissal  52  itself due to a coup in both the Politburo and the Central Committee  53  All Soviet party leaders before Gorbachev died in office  except Georgy Malenkov 54  and Khrushchev  both dismissed from the party leadership amid internal struggle within the party  53  An armored personnel carrier surrounded by anti coup demonstrators in Moscow during the 1991 August Coup In 1988 1990  facing considerable opposition  Mikhail Gorbachev enacted reforms shifting power away from the highest bodies of the party and making the Supreme Soviet less dependent on them  The Congress of People s Deputies was established  the majority of whose members were directly elected in competitive elections held in March 1989  The Congress now elected the Supreme Soviet  which became a full time parliament  much stronger than before  For the first time since the 1920s  it refused to rubber stamp proposals from the party and Council of Ministers  55  In 1990  Gorbachev introduced and assumed the position of the President of the Soviet Union  concentrated power in his executive office  independent of the party  and subordinated the government  56  now renamed the Cabinet of Ministers of the USSR  to himself  57  Tensions grew between the union wide authorities under Gorbachev  reformists led in Russia by Boris Yeltsin and controlling the newly elected Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR  and Communist Party hardliners  On 19 21 August 1991  a group of hardliners staged an abortive coup attempt  Following the failed coup  the State Council of the Soviet Union became the highest organ of state power  in the period of transition   58  Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary  only remaining President for the final months of the existence of the USSR  59  Judicial system Main articles  Law of the Soviet Union and Socialist law The judiciary was not independent of the other branches of government  The Supreme Court supervised the lower courts  People s Court  and applied the law as established by the Constitution or as interpreted by the Supreme Soviet  The Constitutional Oversight Committee reviewed the constitutionality of laws and acts  The Soviet Union used the inquisitorial system of Roman law  where the judge  procurator  and defense attorney collaborate to establish the truth  60  Political divisions Main articles  Soviet Republic  system of government  and Republics of the Soviet Union Constitutionally  the Soviet Union was a union of Soviet Socialist Republics  SSRs  and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic  RSFSR   although the rule of the highly centralized Communist Party made the union merely nominal  30  The Treaty on the Creation of the USSR was signed in December 1922 by four founding republics  the RSFSR  Transcaucasian SFSR  Ukrainian SSR and Belorussian SSR  In 1924  during the national delimitation in Central Asia  the Uzbek and Turkmen SSRs were formed from parts of the RSFSR s Turkestan ASSR and two Soviet dependencies  the Khorezm and Bukharan SSR  In 1929  the Tajik SSR was split off from the Uzbek SSR  With the constitution of 1936  the constituents of the Transcaucasian SFSR  namely the Georgian  Armenian and Azerbaijan SSRs  were elevated to union republics  while the Kazakh and Kirghiz SSRs were split off from the RSFSR  61  In August 1940  the Soviet Union formed the Moldavian SSR from parts of the Ukrainian SSR and parts of Bessarabia annexed from Romania  It also annexed the Baltic states as the Estonian  Latvian and Lithuanian SSRs  The Karelo Finnish SSR was split off from the RSFSR in March 1940 and merged back in 1956  Between July 1956 and September 1991  there were 15 union republics  see map below   62  On 16 November 1988  the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR passed the Estonian Sovereignty Declaration that asserted Estonia s sovereignty and declared the supremacy of Estonian laws over those of the Soviet Union  63  In March 1990  the newly elected Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR declared independence  followed by the Georgian Supreme Soviet in April 1991  Although the symbolic right of the republics to secede was nominally guaranteed by the constitution and the union treaty  30  Soviet authorities at first refused to recognize it  After the August coup attempt  most of the other republics followed suit  The Soviet Union ultimately recognized the secession of Estonia  Latvia and Lithuania on 6 September 1991  The remaining republics were recognized as independent with the Soviet Union s final dissolution in December 1991  64    Republic Map of the Union Republics between 1956 1991 1 Russian SFSR 2 Ukrainian SSR 3 Belorussian SSR 4 Uzbek SSR 5

the Soviet Union The DneproGES  one of many hydroelectric power stations in the Soviet Union The Soviet Union became the first country to adopt a planned economy  whereby production and distribution of goods were centralized and directed by the government  The first Bolshevik experience with a command economy was the policy of War Communism  which involved nationalization of industry  centralized distribution of output  coercive requisition of agricultural production  and attempts to eliminate the circulation of money  as well as private enterprises and free trade  As it had aggravated a severe economic collapse caused by the war  in 1921  Lenin replaced War Communism with the New Economic Policy  NEP   legalizing free trade and private ownership of smaller businesses  The economy quickly recovered  65  Following a lengthy debate among the members of Politburo over the course of economic development  by 1928 1929  upon gaining control of the country  Joseph Stalin abandoned the NEP and pushed for full central planning  starting forced collectivization of agriculture and enacting draconian labor legislation  Resources were mobilized for rapid industrialization  which greatly expanded Soviet capacity in heavy industry and capital goods during the 1930s  65  Preparation for war was one of the main driving forces behind industrialization  mostly due to distrust of the outside capitalistic world  66  As a result  the USSR was transformed from a largely agrarian economy into a great industrial power  leading the way for its emergence as a superpower after World War II  67  During the war  the Soviet economy and infrastructure suffered massive devastation and required extensive reconstruction  68  By the early 1940s  the Soviet economy had become relatively self sufficient  for most of the period until the creation of Comecon  only a very small share of domestic products was traded internationally  69  After the creation of the Eastern Bloc  external trade rose rapidly  Still the influence of the world economy on the USSR was limited by fixed domestic prices and a state monopoly on foreign trade  70  Grain and sophisticated consumer manufactures became major import articles from around the 1960s  69  During the arms race of the Cold War  the Soviet economy was burdened by military expenditures  heavily lobbied for by a powerful bureaucracy dependent on the arms industry  At the same time  the Soviet Union became the largest arms exporter to the Third World  Significant amounts of Soviet resources during the Cold War were allocated in aid to the other socialist states  69  From the 1930s until its collapse in the late 1980s  the way the Soviet economy operated remained essentially unchanged  The economy was formally directed by central planning  carried out by Gosplan and organized in five year plans  In practice  however  the plans were highly aggregated and provisional  subject to ad hoc intervention by superiors  All key economic decisions were taken by the political leadership  Allocated resources and plan targets were normally denominated in rubles rather than in physical goods  Credit was discouraged  but widespread  Final allocation of output was achieved through relatively decentralized  unplanned contracting  Although in theory prices were legally set from above  in practice the actual prices were often negotiated  and informal horizontal links  between producer factories etc   were widespread  65  A number of basic services were state funded  such as education and healthcare  In the manufacturing sector  heavy industry and defense were assigned higher priority than the production of consumer goods  71  Consumer goods  particularly outside large cities  were often scarce  of poor quality and limited choice  Under command economy  consumers had almost no influence over production  so the changing demands of a population with growing incomes could not be satisfied by supplies at rigidly fixed prices  72  A massive unplanned second economy grew up alongside the planned one at low levels  providing some of the goods and services that the planners could not  Legalization of some elements of the decentralized economy was attempted with the reform of 1965  65  At the same time the party elite  aka  nomenclature   enjoyed separate system of supply of goods which provided them with ample supply of high quality goods under lowest prices  the very existence of which was kept secret from the general public  Although statistics of the Soviet economy are notoriously unreliable and its economic growth difficult to estimate precisely  73  74  by most accounts  the economy continued to expand until the mid 1980s  During the 1950s and 1960s  the Soviet economy experienced comparatively high growth and was catching up to the West  75  However  after 1970  the growth  while still positive  steadily declined  much more quickly and consistently than in other countries  despite a rapid increase in the capital stock  the rate of increase in capital was only surpassed by Japan   65  Overall  between 1960 and 1989  the growth rate of per capita income in the Soviet Union was slightly above the world average  based on 102 countries   citation needed  However  given the very high level of investment in physical capital  high percentage of people with a secondary education  and low population increase  the economy should have grown much faster  dubious   discuss  According to Stanley Fischer and William Easterly  the Soviet growth record was among  the worst in the world   By their calculation  per capita income of Soviet Union in 1989 should have been twice as high as it was  if investment  education and population had their typical effect on growth  The authors attribute this poor performance to low productivity of capital in the Soviet Union  76  Steven Rosenfielde states that the standard of living actually declined as a result of Stalin s despotism  and while there was a brief improvement following his death  lapsed into stagnation  77  In 1987  Mikhail Gorbachev tried to reform and revitalize the economy with his program of perestroika  His policies relaxed state control over enterprises  but did not yet allow it to be replaced by market incentives  ultimately resulting in a sharp decline in production output  The economy  already suffering from reduced petroleum export revenues  started to collapse  Prices were still fixed  and property was still largely state owned until after the dissolution of the Soviet Union  65  72  For most of the period after World War II up to its collapse  the Soviet economy was the second largest in the world by GDP  PPP   78  though in per capita terms the Soviet GDP was behind that of the First World countries  79  Energy A Soviet stamp depicting the 30th anniversary of the International Atomic Energy Agency Main article  Energy policy of the Soviet Union The need for fuel declined in the Soviet Union from the 1970s to the 1980s  80  both per ruble of gross social product and per ruble of industrial product  At the start  this decline grew very rapidly  but gradually slowed down between 1970 and 1975  From 1975 and 1980  it grew even slower  clarification needed  only 2 6 percent  81  David Wilson  a historian  believed that the gas industry would account for 40 percent of Soviet fuel production by the end of the century  His theory did not come to fruition because of the USSR s collapse  82  The USSR  in theory  would have continued to have an economic growth rate of 2 2 5 percent during the 1990s because of Soviet energy fields clarification needed   83  However  the energy sector faced many difficulties  among them the country s high military expenditure and hostile relations with the First World  pre Gorbachev era   84  In 1991  the Soviet Union had a pipeline network of 82 000 kilometres  51 000 mi  for crude oil and another 206 500 kilometres  128 300 mi  for natural gas  85 Petroleum and petroleum based products  natural gas  metals  wood  agricultural products  and a variety of manufactured goods  primarily machinery  arms and military equipment  were exported  86  In the 1970s and 1980s  the Soviet Union heavily relied on fossil fuel exports to earn hard currency  69  At its peak in 1988  it was the largest producer and second largest exporter of crude oil  surpassed only by Saudi Arabia  87  Science and technology Main article  Science and technology in the Soviet Union A Soviet stamp showing the orbit of Sputnik The Soviet Union placed great emphasis on science and technology within its economy  88  however  the most remarkable Soviet successes in technology  such as producing the world s first space satellite  typically were the responsibility of the military  71  Lenin believed that the USSR would never overtake the developed world if it remained as technologically backward as it was  Soviet authorities proved their commitment to Lenin s belief by developing massive networks  research and development organizations  By 1989  Soviet scientists were among the world s best trained specialists in several areas  such as energy physics  selected areas of medicine  mathematics  welding and military technologies  Due to rigid state planning and bureaucracy  the Soviets remained far behind technologically in chemistry  biology  and computers when compared to the First World  Project Socrates  under the Reagan administration  determined that the Soviet Union addressed the acquisition of science and technology in a manner that was radically different from what the US was using  In the case of the US  economic prioritization was being used for indigenous research and development as the means to acquire science and technology in both the private and public sectors  In contrast  the Soviet Union was offensively and defensively maneuvering in the acquisition and utilization of the worldwide technology  to increase the competitive advantage that they acquired from the technology  while preventing the US from acquiring a competitive advantage  However  in addition  the Soviet Union s technology based planning was executed in a centralized  government centric manner that greatly hindered its flexibility  It was this significant lack of flexibility that was exploited by the US to undermine the strength of the Soviet Union and thus foster its reform  89  90  91  Transport Main article  Transport in the Soviet Union The Soviet era flag of Aeroflot Transport was a key component of the nation s economy  The economic centralisation of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure on a massive scale  most notably the establishment of Aeroflot  an aviation enterprise  92  The country had a wide variety of modes of transport by land  water and air  85  However  due to bad maintenance  much of the road  water and Soviet civil aviation transport were outdated and technologically backward compared to the First World  93  Soviet rail transport was the largest and most intensively used in the world  93  it was also better developed than most of its Western counterparts  94  By the late 1970s and early 1980s  Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the burden from the railways and to improve the Soviet state budget  95  The road network and automobile industry 96  remained underdeveloped  97  and dirt roads were common outside major cities  98  Soviet maintenance projects proved unable to take care of even the few roads the country had  By the early to mid 1980s  the Soviet authorities tried to solve the road problem by ordering the construction of new ones  98  Meanwhile  the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than road construction  99  The underdeveloped road network led to a growing demand for public transport  100  Despite improvements  several aspects of the transport sector were still riddled with problems due to outdated infrastructure  lack of investment  corruption and bad decision making  Soviet authorities were unable to meet the growing demand for transport infrastructure and services  The Soviet merchant fleet was one of the largest in the world  85  Demographics Main article  Demographics of the Soviet Union The population of the USSR  red  and the post Soviet states  blue  from 1961 to 2009  The first fifty years of the 20th century in tsarist Russia and the Soviet Union were marked by a succession of disasters  each accompanied by large scale population losses  Excess deaths over the course of World War I and the Russian Civil War  including the postwar famine  amounted to a combined total of 18 million  101  some 10 million in the 1930s  18  and more than 26 million in 1941 5  The postwar Soviet population was 45 to 50 million smaller than it would have been if pre war demographic growth had continued  23  The crude birth rate of the USSR decreased from 44 0 per thousand in 1926 to 18 0 in 1974  largely due to increasing urbanization and the rising average age of marriages  The crude death rate demonstrated a gradual decrease as well   from 23 7 per thousand in 1926 to 8 7 in 1974  In general  the birth rates of the southern republics in Transcaucasia and Central Asia were considerably higher than those in the northern parts of the Soviet Union  and in some cases even increased in the post World War II period  a phenomenon partly attributed to slower rates of urbanization and traditionally earlier marriages in the southern republics  102  Soviet Europe moved towards sub replacement fertility  while Soviet Central Asia continued to exhibit population growth well above replacement level fertility  103  The late 1960s and the 1970s witnessed a reversal of the declining trajectory of the rate of mortality in the USSR  and was especially notable among men of working age  but was also prevalent in Russia and other predominantly Slavic areas of the country  104  An analysis of the official data from the late 1980s showed that after worsening in the late 1970s and the early 1980s  adult mortality began to improve again  105  The infant mortality rate increased from 24 7 in 1970 to 27 9 in 1974  Some researchers regarded the rise as largely real  a consequence of worsening health conditions and services  106  The rises in both adult and infant mortality were not explained or defended by Soviet officials  and the Soviet government simply stopped publishing all mortality statistics for ten years  Soviet demographers and health specialists remained silent about the mortality increases until the late 1980s  when the publication of mortality data resumed and researchers could delve into the real causes  107  Education Main article  Education in the Soviet Union Soviet pupils on a visit to Milovice  Czechoslovakia in 1985  Before 1917  education was not free in the Russian Empire and was therefore either inaccessible or barely accessible for many children from lower class working and peasant families  Estimates from 1917 recorded that 75 85 percent of the Russian population was illiterate  Anatoly Lunacharsky became the first People s Commissariat for Education of Soviet Russia  At the beginning  the Soviet authorities placed great emphasis on the elimination of illiteracy  People who were literate were automatically hired as teachers  For a short period  quality was sacrificed for quantity  By 1940  Joseph Stalin could announce that illiteracy had been eliminated  In the aftermath of the Great Patriotic War  the country s educational system expanded dramatically  This expansion had a tremendous effect  In the 1960s  nearly all Soviet children had access to education  the only exception being those living in remote areas  Nikita Khrushchev tried to make education more accessible  making it clear to children that education was closely linked to the needs of society  Education also became important in creating the New Soviet Man  108  Only 20 percent of all applicants were accepted  The rest entered the labor market or learned a skill at a vocational technical school or technicum dubious   discuss   Students from families of dubious political reliability were barred from higher education  109  The Brezhnev administration introduced a rule that required all university applicants to present a reference from the local Komsomol party secretary  110  According to statistics from 1986  the number of students per 10 000 population was 181 for the USSR  compared to 517 for the US  111  Ethnic groups 1974 USSR geographic location of ethnicities The Soviet Union was a very ethnically diverse country  with more than 100 distinct ethnic groups  The total population was estimated at 293 million in 1991  According to a 1990 estimate  the majority were Russians  50 78    followed by Ukrainians  15 45   and Uzbeks  5 84    112  All citizens of the USSR had their own ethnic affiliation  The ethnicity of a person was chosen at the age of sixteen 113  by the child s parents  If the parents did not agree  the child was automatically assigned the ethnicity of the mother  Partly due to Soviet policies  some of the smaller minority ethnic groups were considered part of larger ones  such as the Mingrelians of the Georgian SSR  who were classified with the linguistically related Georgians  114  Some ethnic groups voluntarily assimilated  while others were brought in by force  Russians  Belarusians  and Ukrainians shared close cultural ties  while other groups did not  With multiple nationalities living in the same territory  ethnic antagonisms developed over the years  115  Health Main article  Health care in the Soviet Union In 1917  before the Bolshevik uprising  health conditions were significantly behind the developed countries  As Lenin later noted   Either the lice will defeat socialism  or socialism will defeat the lice   116  The Soviet principle of health care was conceived by the People s Commissariat for Health in 1918  Health care was to be controlled by the state and would be provided to its citizens free of charge  Article 42 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution gave all citizens the right to health protection and free access to any health institutions in the USSR  However  the Soviet Union s health care system was not able to fulfill all the needs of its people  117  Before Leonid Brezhnev rose to power  Soviet socialised medicine was held in high esteem by many foreign specialists  This changed however  from Brezhnev s accession and Mikhail Gorbachev s tenure as leader  the Soviet health care system was heavily criticised for many basic faults  such as the quality of service and the unevenness in its provision  118 Minister of Health Yevgeniy Chazov  during the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  while highlighting such Soviet success as having the most doctors and hospitals in the world  recognised the system s deficiencies and felt that billions of Soviet rubles were squandered  119  After the communist takeover  the life expectancy for all age groups went up  This statistic was used by authorities to prove that the socialist system was superior to the capitalist system  These improvements continued into the 1960s  when the life expectancy in the Soviet Union surpassed that of the United States  It remained stable during most years  although in the 1970s  it went down slightly  probably because of alcohol abuse  Most western sources put the blame on growing alcohol abuse and poor health care  this theory was also implicitly accepted by the Soviet authorities  At the same time  infant mortality began to rise  After 1974  the government stopped publishing statistics on this  This trend can be partly explained by the number of pregnancies rising drastically in the Asian part of the country where infant mortality was highest  while declining markedly in the more developed European part of the Soviet Union  120  Language Main article  Languages of the Soviet Union The Soviet government headed by Vladimir Lenin gave small language groups their own writing systems  121  The development of these writing systems was very successful  even though some flaws were detected  During the later days of the USSR  countries with the same multilingual situation implemented similar policies  A serious problem when creating these writing systems was that the languages differed dialectally greatly from each other  122  When a language had been given a writing system and appeared in a notable publication  that language would attain  official language  status  There were many minority languages which never received their own writing system  therefore their speakers were forced to have a second language  123  There are examples where the Soviet government retreated from this policy  most notable under Stalin s regime  where education was discontinued in languages which were not widespread enough  These languages were then assimilated into another language  mostly Russian  124  During the Great Patriotic War  World War II   some minority languages were banned  and their speakers accused of collaborating with the enemy  125  As the most widely spoken of the Soviet Union s many languages  Russian de facto functioned as an official language as the  language of interethnic communication   Russian                                  but only assumed the de jure status as the official national language in 1990  126  Religion The Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow during its 1931 demolition  General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev makes a toast with Russian Orthodox clergymen and a rabbi at a celebration of the 60th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1977  Main article  Religion in the Soviet Union A L  Eliseev writes that a meeting of the antireligious commission of the Central Committee of the All Union Communist Party  Bolsheviks  took place on 23 May 1929 under the Chairmanship of E  laroslavskii  There  believers in the country were estimated at 80 percent  It cannot be ruled out that this percentage was somewhat understated  to prove the successfulness of the struggle with religion 127  Christianity and Islam had the greatest number of adherents among the Soviet state s religious citizens  128 Eastern Christianity predominated among Christians  with Russia s traditional Russian Orthodox Church being the Soviet Union s largest Christian denomination  About 90 percent of the Soviet Union s Muslims were Sunnis  with Shiites concentrated in the Azerbaijani Soviet Socialist Republic  128  Smaller groups included Roman Catholics  Jews  Buddhists  and a variety of Protestant sects  128  Religious influence had been strong in the Russian Empire  The Russian Orthodox Church enjoyed a privileged status as the church of the monarchy and took part in carrying out official state functions  129  The immediate period following the establishment of the Soviet state included a struggle against the Orthodox Church  which the revolutionaries considered an ally of the former ruling classes  130  In Soviet law  the  freedom to hold religious services  was constitutionally guaranteed  although the ruling Communist Party regarded religion as incompatible with the Marxist spirit of scientific materialism  130  In practice  the Soviet system subscribed to a narrow interpretation of this right  and in fact utilized a range of official measures to discourage religion and curb the activities of religious groups  130  The 1918 Council of People s Commissars decree establishing the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic  RSFSR  as a secular state also decreed that  the teaching of religion in all  places  where subjects of general instruction are taught  is forbidden  Citizens may teach and may be taught religion privately   131  Among further restrictions  those adopted in 1929  a half decade into Stalin s rule  included express prohibitions on a range of church activities  including meetings for organized Bible study  130  Both Christian and non Christian establishments were shut down by the thousands in the 1920s and 1930s  By 1940  as many as 90 percent of the churches  synagogues  and mosques that had been operating in 1917 were closed  132  Convinced that religious anti Sovietism had become a thing of the past  the Stalin regime began shifting to a more moderate religion policy in the late 1930s  133  Soviet religious establishments overwhelmingly rallied to support the war effort during the Soviet war with Nazi Germany  Amid other accommodations to religious faith  churches were reopened  Radio Moscow began broadcasting a religious hour  and a historic meeting between Stalin and Orthodox Church leader Patriarch Sergius I of Moscow was held in 1943  133  The general tendency of this period was an increase in religious activity among believers of all faiths  134  The Soviet establishment again clashed with the churches under General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev s leadership in 1958 1964  a period when atheism was emphasized in the educational curriculum  and numerous state publications promoted atheistic views  133  During this period  the number of churches fell from 20 000 to 10 000 from 1959 to 1965  and the number of synagogues dropped from 500 to 97  135  The number of working mosques also declined  falling from 1 500 to 500 within a decade  135  Religious institutions remained monitored by the Soviet government  but churches  synagogues  temples  and mosques were all given more leeway in the Brezhnev era  136  Official relations between the Orthodox Church and the Soviet government again warmed to the point that the Brezhnev government twice honored Orthodox Patriarch Alexy I with the Order of the Red Banner of Labor  137  A poll conducted by Soviet authorities in 1982 recorded 20 percent of the Soviet population as  active religious believers   138  Culture Main article  Culture of the Soviet Union See also  Soviet cuisine The culture of the Soviet Union passed through several stages during the USSR s 70 year existence  During the first eleven years following the Revolution  1918 1929   there was relative freedom and artists experimented with several different styles to find a distinctive Soviet style of art  Lenin wanted art to be accessible to the Russian people  On the other hand  hundreds of intellectuals  writers  and artists were exiled or executed  and their work banned  for example Nikolay Gumilev  shot for conspiring against the Bolshevik regime  and Yevgeny Zamyatin  banned   139  The government encouraged a variety of trends  In art and literature  numerous schools  some traditional and others radically experimental  proliferated  Communist writers Maksim Gorky and Vladimir Mayakovsky were active during this time  Film  as a means of influencing a largely illiterate society  received encouragement from the state  much of director Sergei Eisenstein s best work dates from this period  Later  during Stalin s rule  Soviet culture was characterised by the rise and domination of the government imposed style of socialist realism  with all other trends being severely repressed  with rare exceptions  for example Mikhail Bulgakov s works  Many writers were imprisoned and killed  140  Following the Khrushchev Thaw of the late 1950s and early 1960s  censorship was diminished  Greater experimentation in art forms were again permissible  with the result that more sophisticated and subtly critical work began to be produced  The regime loosened its emphasis on socialist realism  thus  for instance  many protagonists of the novels of author Yury Trifonov concerned themselves with problems of daily life rather than with building socialism  An underground dissident literature  known as samizdat  developed during this late period  In architecture the Khrushchev era mostly focused on functional design as opposed to the highly decorated style of Stalin s epoch  In the second half of the 1980s  Gorbachev s policies of perestroika and glasnost significantly expanded freedom of expression in the media and press  141  See also Soviet Union portal Communism portal Eurasian Union Index of Soviet Union related articles

The new evidence shows that administrative command planning and Stalin s forced industrialisation strategies failed in the 1930s and beyond  The economic miracle chronicled in official hagiographies and until recently faithfully recounted in Western textbooks has no basis in fact  It is the statistical artefact not of index number relativity  the Gerschenkron effect  but of misapplying to the calculation of growth cost prices that do not accurately measure competitive value  The standard of living declined during the 1930s in response to Stalin s despotism  and after a brief improvement following his death  lapsed into stagnation  Glasnost and post communist revelations interpreted as a whole thus provide no basis for Getty  Rittersporn  amp  Zemskov s relatively favourable characterisation of the methods  economic achievements and human costs of Stalinism  The evidence demonstrates that the suppression of markets and the oppression of vast segments of the population were economically counterproductive and humanly calamitous  just as anyone conversant with classical economic theory should have expected      Central Intelligence Agency  1991    GDP   Million 1990
