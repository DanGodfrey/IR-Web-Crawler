character  Mystique   and with Cockrum s permission  she first appeared in Ms  Marvel No 16  May 1978   11  12  Former X Men writer Claremont has stated that he originally intended Mystique and Destiny to be Nightcrawler s biological parents  with Mystique having morphed into a man for the act of conception   13  but Marvel didn t agree  because at that time the Comics Code Authority and Marvel policy prohibited the explicit portrayal of gay or bisexual characters  14  15  Much later  16  the two were confirmed to have been a couple  13   edit  Fictional character biography  edit  Destiny Despite the fact that Mystique s exact age remains unknown  her earliest meeting with her lover Destiny is stated to have occurred somewhere around  the dawn of the 20th century   17   edit  Early espionage activities and contacts The decades long quest clarification needed  of Mystique and Destiny apparently required them to constantly travel  They encountered Shadowcat and Rachel Summers  who had time traveled from the future and sought to prevent a plot by Nazi agents Baron Wolfgang von Strucker and Geist   Ghost   a member of Nazi intelligence  and their ally Amahl Farouk  Shadow King  The three had conspired to question the rights of the British Monarch to the throne and then to replace him with Oswald Mosley of the British Fascist Party  a likely ally for Nazi Germany  Irene and Raven contacted an acquaintance of theirs  called Logan  to help the time travelers  Irene and Raven advised Shadowcat and Logan against proceeding in their contemplated assassination of Adolf Hitler and other prominent leaders and officials of the Nazi Party  Raven was laconic in only stating   All of us have learned to kill  Logan  But more importantly  we have learned not to kill  And to know the difference   At some point  Raven reportedly lost contact with Irene  She managed to locate her working as an archivist in the Alamogordo nuclear research facilities in New Mexico  Raven was uncertain of Irene s motivation  but apparently trusted her enough not to press for answers   edit  Sabretooth Cover to Sabretooth  2  Art by Mark Texeira  Raven meets Victor Creed  the man known as Sabretooth  At the time  she uses the identity of deceased German secret agent Leni Zauber  Both Leni and Victor had been assigned with the assassination of a scientist in East Berlin  Raven completes the mission in place of Leni  and then she and Victor have to hide in a safe location for a while  They became lovers  but she soon fakes her death in order to leave him  18  The result of this short lived affair is reportedly the birth of Graydon Creed  her earliest known child  A number of stories report that soon after his birth  Raven gives him up for adoption  Others depict Mystique making arrangements for him from a distance  Graydon reportedly spends most of his childhood in a boarding school  Raven keeps track of his activities until he reaches adolescence  Being the child of two mutants  Graydon assumes he is a mutant himself  However  he eventually proves to be a Homo Sapien instead of a Homo Superior  Raven is disappointed and soon abandons him  Graydon grows to hate his parents  and eventually extends his hatred to all mutants  He later becomes leader of the mutant hating organization Friends of Humanity  and then a politician  Graydon  at the height of his political ascension  was assassinated by an unknown shooter  19  The shooter was later revealed to be a time traveling version of Mystique  as part of a convoluted time paradox involving Jean Grey  Iceman  Toad  and Juggernaut  20   edit  Nightcrawler For several years Mystique was also reported to be the mother of Nightcrawler  but the exact events were uncertain  Much later another writer  Chuck Austen  eventually revealed that the father was a demonic looking mutant from biblical times called Azazel  volume  amp  issue needed  At that time  Raven is married to Baron Christian Wagner  older sources give his name as Count Eric Wagner  an affluent member of German nobility  He proves to be a loving husband  but rather disappointing as a lover  His infertility adds to their marital problems  Raven starts using her shapeshifting powers in order to secretly have sexual encounters with others  She is apparently both seeking sexual satisfaction and attempting to conceive another child  She is eventually seduced by fellow mutant Azazel  Azazel states that he is ruler of  an island nation off the coast of Bermuda  La Isla des Demonas   The Island of Demons  He is apparently a fellow shapeshifter  and also has the power of teleportation  He is later revealed to also have the power of immortality and to be the father of an ancient race of mutants known as the Neyaphem  active since at least 2000 BC  His natural form is that of a young man with black hair  yellow eyes  red skin  and a pointed tail  He later claimed to have been posing as a demon and to have used many aliases   Because I am Semihazah  Duma  Keriel  Mastema  Beliar  Gadreel  and Beelzebub  And most commonly called Satan   Many of these aliases have also been claimed by several notable true demons of the Marvel Universe  Raven soon becomes pregnant  Her husband becomes suspicious and his own father suggests a blood test to verify if the child is his  Mystique uses a dagger to murder him and then buries him  She eventually gives birth to a young boy with black hair  yellow eyes  blue skin  and a pointed tail  The locals consider the mother and child to be demons  and attempt to kill them  Mystique manages to escape but abandons her second known son  He is found and raised by Gypsy sorceress Margali Szardos and named Kurt Wagner   edit  Rogue Mystique later becomes the adoptive mother of the girl Rogue  when she was just four years old  Rogue had ran away from her home in rural Caldecott County  Mississippi  The girl was living alone in a wooded area  brandishing a shotgun and trusting no one when Mystique found her  Destiny foresees that Rogue will be important to them and Mystique seeks her out  gains her trust  and takes her in  She and Destiny raise the girl over approximately a decade  and Mystique grows to be very protective of her  Mystique had concealed her superhuman powers and criminal intentions so well over the years that  as Raven Darkh lme  she is able to rise rapidly through the United States Civil Service to the trusted position of Deputy Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA  in the United States Department of Defense  This position gives her access to military secrets and to advanced weaponry  both of which she uses for her own criminal and subversive purposes  In this position  she attempts the theft of the Centurion weaponry from S H I E L D  21  She also beat Ms  Marvel s lover Michael Barnett to death  and sought to kill Ms  Marvel  22  To help her in her criminal activities  Mystique organizes her own incarnation of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants  which originally consisted of herself  Avalanche  the Blob  Destiny  and Pyro  This incarnation of the Brotherhood first gains notoriety when it attempts to assassinate Senator Robert Kelly  a notoriously anti mutant politician  The X Men battle the Brotherhood and thus thwart the assassination attempt  thereby averting a series of events which would have resulted in the death of most super powered humans  and the subjugation of North America by the mutant hunting robots  the Sentinels  as chronicled in the  Days of Future Past  storyline   23  The Brotherhood later clashed with the X Men on other occasions  Rogue is trained by Mystique and eventually joins the Brotherhood  Her mutant power is the ability to absorb the psyche  memories  personality  strengths  and any skills or powers of whomever she touches  Rogue proves to be a powerful member of the team  She goes on many missions with the Brotherhood and  with her help  the team is almost able to defeat the Avengers  24  On a mission with the Avengers  Rogue fights Carol Danvers  Ms  Marvel  Rogue tries stealing Carol s powers  but Carol fights too hard and Rogue ends up absorbing Carol s memories and powers permanently  while Carol is left an empty shell  Professor Xavier later restores Carol s memories  but not the emotions that went with them  Rogue  meanwhile  feels like she is losing her mind  grappling with Danvers  psyche and at times not knowing which memories are really hers  Feeling like she is in danger of losing control of herself  Rogue runs away from home and seeks help from the X Men  hoping that Professor X will be able to treat her  While the other X Men are initially hesitant in accepting their former enemy  Xavier welcomes her and gives her a spot on the team  Worried that Rogue has left because Xavier has brainwashed her  Mystique goes to rescue her  leading an attack on the X Men  Rogue stops her  saying that she has left of her own free will  Mystique is doubtful and hurt  but Rogue ultimately convinces her by saying that Xavier was probably the only person who could help with her powers and give her a chance at a normal life  as she feared the absorbed personality of Carol Danvers would otherwise drive her insane  Mystique grudgingly agrees and lets Rogue stay with the X Men  Though she remains close to Rogue  coming to help her at times  Mystique comes to resent Xavier  Mystique is captured by Carol Danvers at the Pentagon at one point  25  She leads the Brotherhood in clashes with Dazzler  26  and leads the Brotherhood in battle with the X Men as well  27  Mystique later visits Forge  and protests Henry Peter Gyrich s use of Forge s neutralizer  28   edit  Freedom Force Later  anti mutant sentiment among normal humans rises and the federal government launches its own covert anti mutant program  Project Wideawake  Believing that the times have become too dangerous for the Brotherhood to continue its criminal activities  Mystique goes to Doctor Valerie Cooper  special assistant to the head of the National Security Council  and offers the Brotherhood s services to the government  Cooper agrees to convey the offer to the President on the condition that the Brotherhood passes a test she imposes  the capture of Magneto  The Brotherhood  now renamed Freedom Force  succeeds in bringing Magneto to the authorities  though only because he voluntarily surrenders to them so he can go on trial for his crimes and soon afterward officially enter the government s employ  29  In return for entering government service as Freedom Force s leader  Mystique and her team receive a presidential pardon for all criminal charges against them  but the pardon would be revoked if any member of Freedom Force were found committing a crime  Mystique leads Freedom Force in capturing the Avengers on behalf of the federal government  30  She clashes with X Factor in seeking to arrest Rusty Collins  31  With Freedom Force  she fights the X Men in Dallas  and is present at the X Men s apparent demise  32  With Freedom Force  she battles Cyclops and Marvel Girl  33  With Freedom Force she seeks to arrest Rusty Collins again  and battles the New Mutants  34  She finally succeeds in capturing Collins as well as Skids  35  She leads Freedom Force against the Reavers on Muir Island  On this particularly disastrous mission  Freedom Force loses two of its members  Stonewall and Mystique s lover Destiny  36  The death of her lover leaves Mystique psychologically scarred  and she never truly recovers  Mystique is later nearly killed by Dr  Valerie Cooper  who is under the Shadow King s mental control  37  She then impersonates Dr  Valerie Cooper  38  Mystique is eventually discovered impersonating Dr  Cooper  and saves Xavier s life by killing the Shadow King s human host  Jacob Reisz  39  She finally reconciles with Rogue  40  In time  she comes to terms with Destiny s death  41  She teams with Spiral and Wolverine in thwarting Mojo s near destruction of the universe  42  Mystique later briefly stays as a guest at Xavier s mansion  She begins going insane  and leaves the mansion under the care of Forge  43   edit  X Factor Mystique resurfaces several months later  in a failed attempt to kill Legion for his murdering of Destiny  Mystique has an implant put in her skull by Forge in order for the government to be able to keep track of her  She is then forced to become a member of the government sponsored team X Factor after being arrested for trying to blow up a dam  In truth  Mystique had been trying to save the dam  which the U S  Government wanted to destroy so that they could blame it on mutants  She joins coincidentally to the departure of X Factor member Wolfsbane  Her membership leads to tension with her teammates when Sabretooth is added to the team months later as a sleeper agent  for the main purpose of killing Mystique before she could uncover the truth about the conspiracy she had discovered  She slowly develops a romantic relationship with team leader Forge  though he later thought that she was just using him   volume  amp  issue needed  Part of the conspiracy involves Mystique s son Graydon Creed running for President  under an anti mutant platform  volume  amp  issue needed  At the same time  both Graydon and Mystique learn that her lover Destiny had married and had children during one of the couple s separations  Irene s children are now adults with their own children  one of which is a mutant  Graydon has the mutant teen savagely beaten by members of the Friends of Humanity  as a warning towards his mother  Mystique is furious and wants to kill her son  but stops when she is given a message that Graydon s backers want her to kill him and turn her son into a martyr  volume  amp  issue needed  Mystique then seeks to save her son from being betrayed by his backers  but fails miserably  Graydon dies and his death ushers in a new wave of anti mutant violence  Ultimately  Sabretooth acts on his orders to kill the members of X Factor as  Operation Zero Tolerance  is activated  Even though she could have left her teammates to die  Mystique attacks Sabretooth  an act of intervention that distracts Sabretooth long enough to keep him from finishing off the already injured team  Mystique then flees the scene after arranging for the members of X Factor to receive emergency medical treatment for the wounds Sabretooth inflicted  volume  amp  issue needed  Mystique goes into hiding  taking the identity of the senator s wife Mallory Brickman  using her husband s influence to set the FBI on Sabretooth  She prevents Rogue from giving up her mutant powers and she continues her investigation of the U S  Government over her son s death  leading to her aiding Toad and his most recent incarnation of the Brotherhood of Mutants on a mission to raid a government base  The mission fails thanks to Machine Man  who fights the Brotherhood and forces the team to flee  Mystique flees to Europe  at which point her life changes dramatically  While taking the form of a blonde haired woman during a trip to the beach  Mystique is confronted by a famous photographer who tells the mutant that he wants to make her the next big fashion model  volume  amp  issue needed  Amused  Mystique accepts and quickly becomes the fashion industry s newest top model  Using her money  Mystique moves back to New York and into an expensive penthouse apartment  At peace  Mystique buys a telescope and uses it to take in her penthouse s view of New York  This proves to be a huge mistake  as a nearby building is being used by Skrulls loyal to Apocalypse to build the machinery needed for an upcoming scheme of the villains  When one of the Skrulls catches Mystique by her window with her telescope  they assume the worst and frame Mystique for the murder of a Japanese diplomat  With help from Shadowcat and Rogue  Mystique is cleared and leaves town  However  before she leaves  Shadowcat finds one of Destiny s diaries  left there by Destiny herself before she died  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Breakdown Mystique then reaches a breakthrough regarding her investigation of the U S  conspiracy against mutant kind  but fate causes Mystique to suffer a massive blow  While gaining the critical intelligence on the identity of those who were involved in her son s death and the attempt to kill her via Sabretooth  Mystique suddenly loses her powers while pretending to be a man in a busy office workplace  Arrested  Mystique s life is torn apart as the U S  Government acts on their intelligence regarding Mystique  and uses it to destroy all of the alternate identities that Mystique has established over the years and arrange for Mystique to be unable to access any of the money she and Destiny had hidden away over the years  This causes Mystique to lose any self control she might once have had  as the loss of her powers and the loss of her freedom causes her to lash out at everyone around her  Most notably  Rogue feels the brunt of her mother s wrath as Rogue has no sympathy for Mystique s plight  The relationship sours most notably when Rogue refuses to tell Mystique that the X Men are going to fight the High Evolutionary  who was responsible for depowering all mutants  in order to restore everyone s powers  The X Men defeat Evolutionary and restore everyone s powers  allowing Mystique to escape jail  Mystique is later sent back in time by the original X Factor s sentient ship  Raven finds that she is destined to be part of a great time paradox  where she finds herself with a time delay weapon  which she is about to program to kill Graydon  Mystique is confused  because she remembers that she set up the weapon  but never got around to programming it  After some deliberation  she decides to activate the weapon to kill Graydon  Mystique s sanity is further damaged by the revelation that her lover and soulmate Destiny was one of the founding members of the anti mutant conspiracy Mystique had dedicated countless years to fighting  and had willfully withheld medical treatment to mutant children that would have resulted in them not growing up deformed due to their mutations  This led to Raven once again going mad  due to the futility of her mission to change the world for the better  Raven becomes nihilistically obsessed with death and genocide  as she reforms the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants for another assassination attempt on Senator Kelly  and kidnaps Moira MacTaggert and impersonates her in order to access her research on the Legacy Virus  While not the gifted scientist that Moira was  Mystique s insanity and experience with bio terrorism allows her not only to use samples of Moira s Legacy Virus infected blood to create a biological weapon that would infect humans and not mutants  but most importantly  allows her to come up with a cure for the Legacy Virus after repeated readings of all of the doctor s research which  when filtered through Mystique s insane mind  results in her being able to pick up on insights that Moira had missed when researching  The assassination attempt on Kelly ends in failure  when the mutant villain Pyro betrays his teammates to save Kelly s life  Mystique blows up MacTaggert s research facility  fatally injuring the doctor  Mystique then shoots Moira s foster daughter Wolfsbane with a prototype of Forge s neutralizer gun  depowering her  Rogue arrives and confronts her mother  When Mystique reveals her plan to Rogue of using a modified form of the Legacy Virus on the humans  Rogue realizes that her mother is ill and tries to help her  Mystique pretends to accept Rogue s help before stabbing her in the gut  As Mystique confronts the other X Men  Rogue s healing factor revives her  Sneaking behind Mystique  Rogue uses the bone claws she had absorbed from Wolverine and stabs her in the back  Mystique is hospitalized  where she tells the X Men that Destiny had predicted a dark future for mutant kind  and that the future Destiny foretold kept on unfolding despite all that Mystique had done to prevent it  She believes that the only way to save them is to get rid of the humans  for a planet of mutants might survive  while mutants divided against each other and with humanity shunning them as outcasts would be doomed  Mystique is sent to prison  but quickly escapes  She then allies herself with Martinique Jason  the daughter of the original Mastermind  in an attempt to wrest control of the military organization known as the X Corps from its founder  Banshee  Outfitted with a device that gives her the ability to generate an electrical charge  Mystique creates the identity of a supervillain named Surge and joins the X Corps  While Mastermind s daughter mind controls the other members of the organization  Mystique brings Banshee s organization down and slits his throat  leaving him in critical condition   edit  Double agent Charles Xavier is later forced to make Mystique his secret agent  as his previous one  Prudence Leighton  has died and Mystique is the only one suitable enough to complete the missions  Xavier poses as Magneto to rescue Mystique from the Department of Homeland Security and from execution at the hands of Johny Kitano  Special Magistrate for Homo Superior crimes against humanity  and a mutant himself  44  At this time  Mystique claims that there is an imposter out to frame her  taking control over the Brotherhood and sending them on their recent missions  the assassination of Moira and the infiltration of X Corps   Whether she is speaking the truth has not been revealed  The two never truly trust each other  but as long as Mystique completes the missions without killing anybody  Xavier keeps her safe from the authorities  who are out to execute her  Working with Xavier is Forge  with whom Mystique had a brief romance while she was in X Factor  One of Xavier s enemies  the Quiet Man  who is actually Prudence Leighton inhabiting the body of her assassin  45  contacts Mystique and offers to give her an interference transmitter which would keep her safe from the authorities  the same type of device Xavier is using  if she killed Xavier  Creating a plan that would free her from both men  Mystique pretends to try killing Xavier while secretly working with the mutant thief Fantomex  after alerting Forge to stop her at the last moment  Her plan is to have the Quiet Man see this and believe that she really has attempted to kill Xavier and is still working for him  However  the other X Men also believe that Mystique has tried killing Xavier and seek her out  46  Rogue manages to track her down  She disowns her adoptive mother  saying she has tried to forgive Mystique for stabbing her  but that this is too much  She goes on to say that Mystique isn t her mother  that she is a monster  Mystique tries apologizing to Rogue for how she has hurt her  but Rogue is distraught with rage and attacks her foster mother  Mystique manages to escape by blowing up the house and going through the window  changing her form to shield her fall  46  Mystique goes to the Quiet Man  who is planning on having her killed due to outliving her usefulness  After a battle  Mystique kills the Quiet Man  saves her former field handler Shortpack  and discovers the Quiet Man s interference transmitter has been a fake all along  Later  Forge catches Mystique trying to steal his interference transmitter  After some angry words  he smashes it and tells her he never wants to see her again  The two share a sad goodbye kiss and Mystique leaves  After Mystique is gone  Forge realizes that she had already switched his transmitter for the fake one  45   edit  Joining the X Men Mystique later infiltrates the X Men  posing as a young girl named Foxx and joining Gambit s training squad  the Chevaliers  47  She attempts to seduce Rogue s boyfriend Gambit to break them up so she can set her daughter up with a young mutant named Augustus  a man with whom she believes Rogue could be the happiest  48  Though severely tempted by  Foxx s  advances  Gambit resists  Mystique ultimately reveals herself to him  telling him that she is trying to relieve the tension between him and Rogue  because of the two being unable to touch due to her ability to absorb someone s essence upon skin to skin contact   Mystique then metamorphoses into Rogue and tells Gambit that he would not be cheating on Rogue if he had sex with her in Rogue s form  49  When the telepath Emma Frost discovers who Foxx really is  the X Men confront Mystique  Mystique tells them that she had been lonely and wants to join the X Men  Emma also discovers that Gambit had known who Foxx really was all along  and a furious Rogue believes the two have been having an affair  Mystique would not reveal if she and Gambit did anything  but tells Rogue that if he truly loves her he would not have been tempted  and that she deserves better than him  Gambit denies anything had happened  50  Later  the X Men vote and decide to have Mystique join them on a probationary status  though Rogue is one of the ones who vote against her joining   Meanwhile  Nightcrawler asks her to leave for a while regardless of the vote  saying that he needs more time adjusting to the idea of her being a member first  Mystique ultimately agrees and leaves  51  However  after M Day  she joins the X Men and brings Augustus  Pulse  along with her  Both have been crucial in the latest downfall of Apocalypse  Rogue believes that Mystique s transformation is yet another act  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Marauders Mystique is a great assistance in the battle against the Children of the Vault  killing Sangre by pumping thermite bullets into his aquatic body  After the Hecatomb battle on Providence  Rogue s team  sans Cable  return to Rogue s former childhood home in Caldecott County  Mississippi  which Mystique owns for some downtime  Mystique consummates her flirtation with Iceman  and even alerts the X Men  who come to treat Rogue s illness  that there are intruders in the area  Only after Lady Mastermind drops her illusions do the X Men realize that it is an all out attack  and that both Lady Mastermind and Omega Sentinel  the latter being possessed by Malice  have defected sides  During the Marauders  initial ambush  Mystique prevents Scalphunter from shooting Rogue  She then reveals herself as a traitor as well when she shoots her adopted daughter and  standing over her body  orders the remaining Marauders to kill the X Men   edit  Messiah Complex Mystique remains with the Marauders during the hunt for the first new mutant baby  but is revealed to have murdered Sinister in a plot involving the baby and Rogue s killing touch  She also appears to be working with Gambit  who  like her  has plenty of ulterior motives to want to betray Mister Sinister  When Sinister approaches Mystique as she is with the comatose Rogue  Mystique shoves Sinister onto Rogue  killing him through fatal skin to skin contact  Then  in keeping with the words of the Destiny Diaries  she touches the baby s face to Rogue s  believing that this will heal her foster daughter  While the baby is not affected by Rogue s power  to Mystique s surprise  Rogue does not awaken as the Destiny Diaries predicted  Believing their plan to have failed  Mystique and Gambit cry at Rogue s bedside  As they grieve  Rogue finally awakens  After hearing all that Mystique has done  and sick of her manipulations  Rogue says she s tired of people getting hurt whenever Mystique is around  and tries to kill her with her touch  When Mystique is merely rendered unconscious  Rogue discovers that the baby s powers have restored her own to normal  The baby s touch has purged her of the Strain 88 virus and all the residual psyches she had absorbed over her life  including Hecatomb  However  she now has the consciousness and the memories of the one person she wants nothing more to do with  Mystique  Sickened by what she has absorbed  Rogue tells Gambit that she needs to be alone  and leaves   edit  Get Mystique Mystique is the focus of the next Wolverine story arc  appropriately titled  Get Mystique   52  The story begins with a brief flashback revealing that Logan and Mystique first met in Mexico in 1921  Back in the

over the border to Afghanistan  There she impersonates Wolverine and kills a local village girl  tricking the villagers into going after Wolverine  53  Mystique does not appear to be suffering from

into a windshield of an automobile  Wolverine then gets a call from his ally Maverick stating The Red Right Hand can be found in Mexico  Mystique  riddled with bullets  shoots Lord Deathstrike in the head but it doesn t affect him as he is in a ghost like  non corporeal state and phases into the solid ground beneath them  Mystique then confronts Wolverine and claims that her role in his recent exile to hell was something she doesn t regret  She then continues to disparage him  stating that his own pursuit of her for her crimes is hypocritical seeing as how he s killed and betrayed many in his years  She claims the only reason she is helping him is in honor of her deceased son Nightcrawler and his devotion to Wolverine  nothing else  Mystique insists that he for once listen to what she has to say but he states that he s heard enough and walks toward her with his claws popped  Perturbed  Mystique draws a pistol and curses him out then is quickly gutted by Wolverine and finally killed  her body lying in a pool of blood  Lord Deathstrike collects Mystique s body and auctions it off to the highest bidder  Her corpse is sold for 5 million to group of ninjas  It is implied these are possibly agents of league of assassins known as  The Hand  given their reputation for restoring fallen warriors  They are not in the traditional red garb but  The Hand  has on occasion been shown to wear black or white uniforms  61   edit  Back In Japan Mystique is seen alive again posing as Sabretooth at L A X  Airport  62  In the form of Sabretooth she has agreed to assist the Hellfire Club in their destruction of the Jean Grey School  presumably as a way of getting revenge on Wolverine as he is the schools headmaster  volume  amp  issue needed  It is revealed that when the Hand revived Mystique  her powers were enhanced and she is now capable of changing her scent to match the forms she takes   63   edit  Powers and abilities Mystique is a mutant shapeshifter with the ability to psionically shift the formation of her biological cells at will to change her appearance and thereby assume the form of other humans  She can also alter her voice to duplicate exactly that of another person  Originally  it was clearly stated that Mystique s powers were limited to appearances only  she could not assume the powers of the people she morphed into or alter her body to adapt to different situations  In addition  she cannot change her overall body mass when taking on the appearance of a person larger or smaller than she is  Her body is not limited to purely organic appearances  She has the ability to create the appearance of clothes out of her own body  Mystique is shown in at least one instance transforming a metallic part of her costume into a functioning blaster pistol  Whether this is a function of her powers or of the costume piece itself is unclear  She can transform part of her body into a separated  clear and hard substance that appears to be glass  as she does when she appears to be wearing glasses  As a shape shifter  Mystique is able to constantly alter and rejuvenate her body s cells and thereby retain her youthful appearance despite being alive for over one hundred years  This changes in 2001 s X Men Forever miniseries  in which Mystique is exposed to dangerous levels of radiation in order to save the life of Toad  The process morphs Mystique s appearance to match her more reptilian physique from the 2000s film trilogy  and boosts her powers so that she can now morph her body into taking certain desired physical traits depending on her situation at the time  Examples of this new ability include night vision  wings on her back  talons in her fingers  and natural body armor  volume  amp  issue needed  She can even compress nearly two dimensional like a sheet of paper to glide on air currents  similar to Mister Fantastic  which she uses to survive an explosion  46  She has moved her vital organs out of place in order to survive a gunshot to her torso  She has  once with strain  given herself two heads and four arms to facilitate a gun fight on two fronts  as well as shapeshifted into herself as a child  She is also now able to hold a shape when knocked unconscious  64  Damage to her biological tissue is known to heal at a relatively fast rate and she can form a resistance to poisons upon contracting them  Recently she has stated that her body mass is not fixed and can change when she does  65  While she retains her advanced powers  she now appears in her old form without scales  Her powers grant her immunity to diseases  enhanced agility  and agelessness  2  Mystique is a cunning strategist in terrorist and commando operations  and adept at martial arts and information technology  She has a talent for finding  stealing  and understanding cutting edge weaponry  She is a talented actress  She has some natural resistance to telepathic intrusion and wears devices to prevent her mind from being read by telepathy  Furthermore  with over a century s experience in posing as other people she has picked up the uncanny skill of being able to identify people posing as others based on body language and changes in behavioral cues   edit  Other versions  edit  Absorbed by Rogue A copy of Mystique s mind  including her memories and personality  exists within the mind of Rogue ever since the events of  X Men  Messiah Complex   She converses with Rogue  She also requests that Rogue turn over control of their body  Eventually she is erased by Professor Xavier  66   edit  Age of Apocalypse In the Age of Apocalypse timeline  Mystique is the ferrywoman to Avalon  It is her task to meet the refugees and make sure they meet the guide to Avalon  Cain  Though she works against Apocalypse  she is not much of a hero  She charges a heavy tariff to ferry the refugees to Avalon  taking all of their valuables  This plagues her conscience and she is reluctant to go to Avalon  as she feels that she is not fit to enter  Ultimately  she gets past her guilt to guide her son  Nightcrawler  to Avalon and find Destiny  She and her son form X Calibre to defeat Apocalypse s agents  the Pale Riders and the Shadow King   edit  Cable s Future Mystique inquires of Cable  How does  history  judge the part we play here and now in protecting the remnants of mutant kind   He says  History is short on specifics  and that it only remembers broad movements  not individuals  She hints at wanting to know how she is remembered  and he comments that her name did survive in a database of his time  Her name is synonymous with traitor  comparing her name to Judas Iscariot  However  he does add that the information from his time is part of his history  as it was 2 000 years old  67   edit  Exiles Mystiq  Raphael Raven Darkholme   Art by Tom Grummett  In the Earth 797 reality  Mystique is apparently a man and goes by the name of Raphael Raven Darkholme  and his alias is Mystiq   Much like the main Mystique  he has a relationship with Destiny but due to his gender has a child with her  Claremont s original plan for Nightcrawler s origin   They are both killed in unknown circumstances and Raphael often goes to their grave sites  On such an occasion  he is about to be attacked by soldiers when the Exiles  Sabretooth  who had been stranded on this Earth  saves his life  Saying he is in his debt  he joins the Exiles when they come to pick up their teammate   edit  House of M In the House of M  Mystique is an agent of S H I E L D  and a member of its elite unit  the Red Guard  alongside Jessica Drew  68  Toad  and her children Rogue and Nightcrawler  She s also involved in an affair with Wolverine  the Red Guard s leader  When this unit  in pursuit of their
