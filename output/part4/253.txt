band  1909  Benny was born Benjamin Kubelsky 1  on February 14  1894  in Chicago  Illinois  2  and grew up in neighboring Waukegan  Illinois  He was the son of Meyer Kubelsky and Emma Sachs Kubelsky  Meyer was a Jewish saloon owner  later to become a haberdasher  who had emigrated to America from Poland  3  4  5  6  7  Emma had emigrated from Lithuania  Benny began studying the violin  an instrument that would become his trademark  when he was just six  with his parents  hopes that he would be a great classical violinist  He loved the violin  but hated practice  By age 14  he was playing in local dance bands as well as in his high school orchestra  Benny was a dreamer and a poor student and he was expelled from high school  He did equally badly in business school and at his father s trade  At age 17  he began playing the instrument in local vaudeville theaters for  7 50 a week  8  He was joined by Ned Miller  a young composer and singer  on the vaudeville circuit  9  They became life long friends and Miller eventually joined the cast of The Jack Benny Program in the 1960s  In 1911  Benny was playing in the same theater as the young Marx Brothers  whose mother Minnie was so enchanted with Benny s musicianship that she invited him to be their permanent accompanist  The plan was foiled by Benny s parents  who refused to let their son  then 17  go on the road  but it was the beginning of his long friendship with Zeppo Marx  Benny s future wife Mary Livingstone was a distant cousin of the Marx Brothers  The following year  Benny formed a vaudeville musical duo with pianist Cora Salisbury  a buxom 45 year old widow who needed a partner for her act  This provoked famous violinist Jan Kubelik  who thought that the young vaudeville entertainer with a similar name  Kubelsky  would damage his reputation  Under pressure from Kubelik s lawyer  Benjamin Kubelsky agreed to change his name to Ben K  Benny  sometimes spelled Bennie   When Salisbury left the act  Benny found a new pianist  Lyman Woods  and re named the act  From Grand Opera to Ragtime   They worked together for five years and slowly added comedy elements to the show  They even reached the Palace Theater  the  Mecca of Vaudeville   but bombed  Benny left show business briefly in 1917 to join the U S  Navy during World War I  and he often entertained the troops with his violin playing  One evening  his violin performance was booed by the troops  so with prompting from fellow sailor and actor Pat O Brien  he ad libbed his way out of the jam and left them laughing  He got more comedy spots in the revues and was a big hit  and earned himself a reputation as a comedian as well as a musician  Shortly after the war  Benny started a one man act   Ben K  Benny  Fiddle Funology   8  But then he heard from another lawyer  this time that of Ben Bernie  another patter and fiddle performer who also threatened to sue  So Benny adopted the common sailor s nickname Jack  By 1921  the fiddle became more of a prop and the low key comedy took over  Benny had several romantic encounters  including one with a dancer  Mary Kelly  whose devoutly Catholic family forced her to turn down Benny s proposal because he was Jewish  Benny was introduced to Mary Kelly by Gracie Allen  Some years after their split  Kelly resurfaced as a dowdy fat girl and Jack gave her a part in an act of three girls  one homely  one fat and one who couldn t sing  This lasted until  at Mary Livingstone s request  Mary Kelly was let go  In 1922  Jack accompanied Zeppo Marx to a Passover seder where he met Sadye  Sadie  Marks  whom he married in 1927 after meeting again on a double date  She was working in the hosiery section of the Hollywood Boulevard branch of the May Company and Benny would court her there  8  Called on to fill in for the  dumb girl  part in one of Benny s routines  Sadie proved a natural comedienne and a big hit  Adopting Mary Livingstone as her stage name  Sadie became Benny s collaborator throughout most of his career  They later adopted a daughter  Joan  In 1929  Benny s agent Sam Lyons convinced MGM s Irving Thalberg to catch Benny s act at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles  Benny was signed to a five year contract and his first film role was in The Hollywood Revue of 1929  His next movie  Chasing Rainbows  was a flop and after several months  Benny was released from his contract and returned to Broadway in Earl Carroll s Vanities  At first dubious about the viability of radio  Benny was eager to break into the new medium  In 1932  after a four week nightclub run  he was invited onto Ed Sullivan s radio program  uttering his first radio spiel  This is Jack Benny talking  There will be a slight pause while you say   Who cares       8   edit  Radio  edit  History Benny in 1933  when he was newly arrived at NBC and the host of The Chevrolet Program  Benny had been only a minor vaudeville performer  but he became a national figure with The Jack Benny Program  a weekly radio show which ran from 1932 to 1948 on NBC and from 1949 to 1955 on CBS  It was consistently among the most highly rated programs during most of that run  10  11  On April 6  1932  the NBC Commercial Program Department arranged for an audition of Jack Benny for Ayer and its client Canada Dry  after which its head  Bertha Brainard made an assessment of this new comic   We think Mr  Benny is excellent for radio  and while the audition was unassisted as far as orchestra was concerned  we believe he would make a great bet for an air program   With Canada Dry Ginger Ale as a sponsor  Benny came to radio on The Canada Dry Program  beginning May 2  1932  on the NBC Blue Network and continuing there for six months until October 26  moving the show to CBS on October 30  With Ted Weems leading the band  Benny stayed on CBS until January 26  1933  The commercial ran twice a week from 9 30 to 10 00  it ran for almost a year  12  Arriving at NBC on March 17  Benny did The Chevrolet Program until April 1  1934  He continued with sponsor General Tire through the end of the season  In October  1934  General Foods  the makers of Jell O and Grape Nuts  became the sponsor most identified with Jack  for the next ten years  American Tobacco s Lucky Strike was his longest lasting radio sponsor  from October  1944  through the end of his original radio series  The show switched networks to CBS on January 2  1949  as part of CBS president William S  Paley s notorious  raid  of NBC talent in 1948 49  There it stayed for the remainder of its radio run  which ended on May 22  1955  CBS aired repeats of old radio episodes from 1956 to 1958 as The Best of Benny   edit  Characters This article may contain original research  Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding references  Statements consisting only of original research may be removed  More details may be available on the talk page   December 2010  Jack Benny  Mary Livingstone  and Eddie Anderson  Rochester  in a group portrait  Benny s comic persona changed in the course of his career  At some time he developed the tightwad cheapskate persona  13  this stage character was just about everything the actual Jack Benny was not  citation needed  cheap  petty  vain  and self congratulatory  His comic rendering of these traits became the linchpin to the Benny show s success  Benny set himself up as the comedic foil  allowing his supporting characters to draw laughs at the expense of his character s flaws  By allowing such a character to be seen as human and vulnerable  in an era where few male characters were allowed such obvious vulnerability  Benny made what might have been a despicable character into a lovable Everyman character  Benny himself said on several occasions   I don t care who gets the laughs on my show  as long as the show is funny   In her book  Benny s daughter Joan said her father always said it doesn t matter who gets laughs  because come the next day they will say   Remember the Jack Benny Show  last night  it was good  or it was bad   Jack felt he got the credit or blame either way  not the actor saying the lines  so it had better be funny  The supporting characters who amplified that vulnerability only too gladly included wife Mary Livingstone as his wisecracking and not especially deferential female friend  not quite his girlfriend  since Benny would often try to date movie stars like Barbara Stanwyck  and occasionally had stage girlfriends such as  Gladys Zybisco    rotund announcer Don Wilson  who also served as announcer for Fanny Brice s hit  Baby Snooks   bandleader Phil Harris as a jive talking  wine and women type whose repartee was rather risqu  for its time  boy tenor Dennis Day  who was cast as a sheltered  na ve youth who still got the better of his boss as often as not  this character was originated by Kenny Baker  but perfected by Day   and  especially  Eddie Anderson as valet chauffeur Rochester van Jones who was as popular as Benny himself  Singer Larry Stevens was Dennis Day s replacement from 11 5 44 to 3 10 46 while Day was in the Navy  And that was itself a radical proposition for the era  unlike the protagonists of Amos  n  Andy  Rochester was a black man allowed to one up his vain  skinflint boss  In more ways than one  with his mock befuddled one liners and his sharp retorts  he broke a comedic racial barrier  Unlike many black supporting characters of the time  Rochester was depicted and treated as a regular member of Benny s fictional household  Benny  in character  tended if anything to treat Rochester more like an equal partner than as a hired domestic  even though gags about Rochester s flimsy salary were a regular part of the show  Rochester seemed to see right through his boss s vanities and knew how to prick them without overdoing it  often with his famous line  Oh  Boss  come now   Benny deserves credit for allowing this character and the actor who played him  it is difficult  if not impossible  to picture any other performer giving Rochester what Anderson gave him  to transcend the era s racial stereotype and for not discouraging his near equal popularity  A New Year s Eve episode  in particular  shows the love each performer had for the other  quietly toasting each other with champagne  That this attention to Rochester s race was no accident became clearer during World War II  when Benny would frequently pay tribute to the diversity of Americans who had been drafted into service  After the war  once the depths of Nazi race hatred had been revealed  Benny made a conscious effort to remove the most stereotypical aspects of Rochester s character  In 1948  it became apparent to Benny how much the times had changed when a 1941 script for  The Jack Benny Program  was re used for one week s show  The script included mention of several African American stereotypes  i e  a reference to Rochester carrying a razor   and prompted a number of listeners  who didn t know the script was an old one  to send in angry letters protesting the stereotypes  Thereafter  Benny insisted that his writers should make sure that no racial jokes or references should be heard on his show  Benny also often gave key guest star appearances to African American performers such as Louis Armstrong and The Ink Spots  Group photograph of Eddie Anderson  Dennis Day  Phil Harris  Mary Livingstone  Jack Benny  Don Wilson  and Mel Blanc  The rest of Benny s cast included character actors and comedians  Sheldon Leonard  later a hugely successful television producer and creator  as a tight lipped racetrack tout Joseph Kearns  best remembered as cantankerous Mr  Wilson on the television version of Dennis the Menace  as Ed  the superannuated guard to Jack s money vault Verna Felton as Dennis Day s mother Frank Nelson  usually as an oily desk clerk or floorwalker  always greeting Benny with an eager Yeeeeeeesss   singer bandleader Bob Crosby  who succeeded Phil Harris in the early 1950s   Artie Auerbach as the Yiddish accented Mr  Kitzel   hoo  hoo  hoo     Bea Benaderet  as Gertrude the switchboard operator  Mel Blanc  who provided several characters  voices  including the railroad station announcer who said   Train leaving on track five for Anaheim  Azusa and Cu    camonga    This running gag became so well known  including use in several Bugs Bunny cartoons  which Mel Blanc also voiced   that it eventually led to a statue of Benny in Cucamonga  Blanc also was featured with Benny in the classic Si Sy routine and on radio as the sound of Benny s Maxwell automobile  Blanc is perhaps best remembered as Benny s perpetually frustrated violin teacher  Professor LeBlanc  who was as likely to throw his own and Benny s instrument into the fireplace as he was to have a nervous breakdown before he was out the door  Other musical contributions came starting in 1946 from the singing quartet the Sportsmen  members  Bill Days  Max Smith  Marty Sperzel and Gurney Bell  singing the middle Lucky Strike commercial  In the early days of the program  the supporting characters were often vaudevillian ethnic stereotypes whose humor was grounded in dialects  As the years went by  the humor of these figures became more character based  Benny s method of bringing a character into a skit  by announcing his name  also became a well known Benny shtick   Oh  Dennis     or  Oh  Rochester     typically answered by   Yes  Mr  Benny  Boss     edit  Situations This statue of Jack Benny in Rancho Cucamonga  located inside the Epicenter Stadium at Jack Benny Way and Rochester Avenue  commemorates the program s famed running gag   Train leaving on track five for Anaheim  Azusa and Cu ca monga   The Jack Benny Program evolved from a variety show blending sketch comedy and musical interludes into the situation comedy form we know even now  crafting particular situations and scenarios from the fictionalization of Benny the radio star  Any situation from hosting a party to income tax time to a night on the town was good for a Benny show  and somehow the writers and star would find the right ways and places to insert musical interludes from Phil Harris and Dennis Day  With Day  invariably  it would be a brief sketch that ended with Benny ordering Day to sing the song he planned to do on that week s show  One extremely popular scenario that became an annual tradition on The Jack Benny Program was the  Christmas Shopping  episode  in which Benny would head to a local department store  Each year  Benny would buy a ridiculously cheap Christmas gift for Don Wilson from a store clerk played by Mel Blanc  Benny would then have second  then third  and even fourth  thoughts about his gift choice  driving Blanc  or  in two other cases  his wife and his psychiatrist  as well  to hilarious insanity by exchanging the gift  pestering about the Christmas card or wrapping paper countless times throughout the episode  in many cases  the clerk would commit suicide  or attempt and fail to commit suicide   Look what you done  You made me so nervous  I missed    as a result  In the 1946 Christmas episode  for example  Benny buys shoelaces for Don  and then is unable to make up his mind whether to give Wilson shoelaces with plastic tips or shoelaces with metal tips  After Benny exchanges the shoelaces repeatedly  Mel Blanc is heard screaming insanely   Plastic tips  Metal tips  I can t stand it anymore   A variation in 1948 concerned Benny buying an expensive wallet for Don  but repeatedly changing the greeting card inserted prompting Blanc to shout   I haven t run into anyone like you in 20 years  Oh  why did the governor have to give me that pardon      until Benny realizes that he should have gotten Don a wallet for  1 98  whereupon the put upon clerk immediately responds by committing suicide  Over the years  in these Christmas episodes  Benny bought and repeatedly exchanged cuff links  golf tees  a box of dates  a paint set  water colors or oils   and even a gopher trap  In 1936  after a few years broadcasting from New York  Benny moved the show to Los Angeles  allowing him to bring in guests from among his show business friends   such as Frank Sinatra  James Stewart  Judy Garland  Barbara Stanwyck  Bing Crosby  Burns and Allen  George Burns was Benny s closest friend   and many others  Burns and Allen and Orson Welles guest hosted several episodes in March and April 1943 when Benny was seriously ill with pneumonia  while Ronald Colman and his wife Benita Hume appeared frequently in the 1940s as Benny s long suffering neighbors  On the January 8  1950 broadcast  journalist Drew Pearson was the subject of a joke gone wrong  Announcer Don Wilson was to say he heard Jack bought a new suit on Drew Pearson  but said Pearson s name wrong  Don said  Drear Pewson   Later on in the show  comedic actor Frank Nelson was asked by Benny if he was the doorman  Changing the script  by suggestion of the writers   Nelson said   Well who do you think I am     Drear Pewson   The audience laughed for almost 30 seconds   edit  Sponsors In the early days of radio  and in the early television era  often as not   the airtime was owned by the sponsor  and Benny made a point of incorporating the commercials into the body of the show  Sometimes the sponsors were the butt of jokes  though Benny did not deploy this device as frequently as his friend and  rival  Fred Allen did at the time  or as his cast member Phil Harris later did on his own successful radio sitcom  Nevertheless  for many years Benny insisted in contract negotiations that his writers pen the sponsor s commercial in the middle of the program  leaving the sponsor to provide the opening and closing spots  and the resulting ads were cleverly and wittily worked into the storyline of the show  For example  on one program  Don Wilson accidentally misread Lucky Strike s slogan   Be happy  go Lucky   as  Be Lucky  go happy   prompting a story arc over several weeks that had Wilson unable to attend the show due to being severely traumatized by the error  In fact  the radio show was generally not announced as The Jack Benny Program  Instead  the primary name of the show tied to the sponsor  Benny s first sponsor was Canada Dry Ginger Ale from 1932 to 1933  Benny s sponsors included Chevrolet from 1933 to 1934  General Tire in 1934  and Jell O from 1934 to 1942  The Jell O Program Starring Jack Benny was so successful in selling Jell O  in fact  that General Foods could not manufacture it fast enough when sugar shortages arose in the early years of World War II  and the company had to stop advertising the popular dessert mix  General Foods switched the Benny program from Jell O to Grape Nuts from 1942 to 1944  and it became  naturally  The Grape Nuts Program Starring Jack Benny  Benny s longest running sponsor  however  was the American Tobacco Company s Lucky Strike cigarettes  from 1944 to 1955  when the show was usually announced as The Lucky Strike Program starring Jack Benny   edit  Writers Benny was notable for employing a small group of writers  most of whom stayed with him for many years  This was very much in contrast to other successful radio or television comedians  such as Bob Hope  who would change writers frequently  Historical accounts  like those by longtime Benny writer Milt Josefsberg  indicate that Benny s role was essentially that of both head writer and director of his radio programs  though he was not credited in either capacity  In contrast to Fred Allen  who initially personally wrote all of his own radio scripts  and continued to extensively rewrite scripts produced in later years by a writing staff   Jack Benny was often described by his writers as a consummate comedy editor rather than a writer per se  He would often debate the precise wording of jokes  and always sought to ensure the preservation of the integrity of the show s characters above easy gags  citation needed  Jack Benny has a reputation for being a master of timing  Since his days at the radio  he often explored the limits of timing for comedic purposes  like pausing a disproportionate amount of time before answering a question  13  14   edit  Theme music During his early radio shows  there was no recurring theme  the program instead opening each week with a different then current popular song  Throughout the Jello and Grapenuts years  announcer Don Wilson would announce the name of the show  some of the cast  and then state  The orchestra opens the program with  name of song    The orchestra number would continue softly as background for Don Wilson s opening commercial  Starting in the Lucky Strike era  Benny adopted a medley of  Yankee Doodle Dandy  and  Love in Bloom  as his theme music  opening every show   Love in Bloom  later became the theme of his television show as well  His radio shows often ended with the orchestra playing  Hooray for Hollywood   The TV show ended with one of two bouncy instrumentals written for the show by his musical arranger and conductor  Mahlon Merrick  Benny would sometimes joke about the propriety of  Love in Bloom  as his theme song  On a segment often played in Tonight Show retrospectives  Benny talks with Johnny Carson about this  Benny says he has no objections to the song in and of itself  only as his theme  Proving his point  he begins reciting the lyrics slowly and deliberately   Can it be the trees  That fill the breeze  With rare and magic perfume  Now what the hell has that got to do with me    edit   Your money or your life  Harry Truman and Jack Benny 3 September 1959 In an episode broadcast March 28  1948  Benny borrowed neighbor Ronald Colman s Oscar  and was returning home when accosted by a mugger  voiced by comedian Eddie Marr   After asking for a match to light a cigarette  the mugger demanded   Don t make a move  this is a stickup  Now  come on  Your money or your life   Benny paused  and the studio audience knowing his skinflint character laughed  The robber then repeated his demand   Look  bud  I said your money or your life   And that s when Benny snapped back  without a break   I m thinking it over   This time  the audience laughed louder and longer than they had during the pause  The punchline came to Benny staff writers John Tackaberry and Milt Josefsberg almost by accident  Writer George Balzer described the scene to author Jordan R  Young  for The Laugh Crafters  a 1999 book of interviews with veteran radio and television comedy writers      they had come to a point where they had the line   Your money or your life   And that stopped them    Milt is pacing up and down  trying to get a follow    And he gets a little peeved at Tack  and he says   For God s sakes  Tack  say something   Tack  maybe he was half asleep in defense of himself  says   I m thinking it over   And Milt says   Wait a minute  That s it   And that s the line that went in the script    By the way  that was not the biggest laugh that Jack ever got  It has the reputation of getting the biggest laugh  But that s not true  The actual length of the laugh the joke got was five seconds when originally delivered and seven seconds when the gag was reprised on a follow up show  In fact  the joke is probably not so memorable for the length of the laugh it provoked  but because it became the definitive  Jack Benny joke  the joke that best illustrated Benny s  stingy man  persona  The punchline  I m thinking it over   simply would not have worked with any other comedian but Benny  The actual longest laugh known to collectors of The Jack Benny Program lasted in excess of 32 seconds  The International Jack Benny Fan Club 15  reports that  at the close of the program broadcast on December 13  1936  sponsored by Jell O  guest Andy Devine says that it is the  last number of the eleventh program in the new Jelly series   The audience  who loved any sort of accidental flub in the live program  is still laughing after 32 seconds  at which point the network cut off the program to prevent it from running overtime  According to Jack himself  Mary Livingstone got the biggest laugh he ever heard on the show  on the April 25  1948 broadcast  The punchline was the result of the following exchange between Don Wilson and noted opera singer Dorothy Kirsten  Don Wilson  Oh  Miss Kirsten  I wanted to tell you that I saw you in  Madame Butterfly  Wednesday afternoon  and I thought your performance was simply magnificent  Dorothy Kirsten  Well  thanks  awfully  It s awfully nice and kind of you  Mr  Wilson  But  uh  who could help singing Puccini  It s so expressive  And particularly in the last act  starting with the allegro vivacissimo  Don Wilson  Well  now  that s being very modest  Miss Kirsten  But not every singer has the necessary bel canto and flexibility or range to cope with the high tessitura of the first act  Dorothy Kirsten  Thank you  Mr  Wilson  And don t you think that in the aria   Un bel d  vedremo   that the strings played the con molto passione exceptionally fine and with great sostenuto  Jack Benny  Well  I thought   Mary Livingstone  to Jack   Oh  shut up  According to Jack  the huge laugh resulted from the long buildup  and the audience s knowledge that Jack  with his pompous persona  would have to break into the conversation at some point  A nearly identical exchange occurred over a year earlier  among renowned violinist Isaac Stern  actor Ronald Colman  Jack Benny  and Mary Livingstone  The quartet s back and forth  which centered on Stern s recent public performance of a Mendelssohn piece  was heard on an episode first broadcast on February 16  1947  The resulting laughter lasted some 18 seconds  after which Jack retorted   Mary  that s no way to talk to Mr  Stern   Later in life  when performing as a stand up comedian in Las Vegas  Jack had just begun to tell an old joke about the salesman  the farmer and the farmer s daughter   So the salesman and the farmer s daughter come to the front door  and the farmer opens the door   At this point  Sammy Davis  Jr  walks onstage behind Jack  the audience screams  and Sammy proceeds to speak and sing and dance about 25 minutes or so  while Jack continues to stand at center stage  quietly watching the spectacle  When Davis finally walks offstage and the audience s applause dies down  Jack continues to watch Davis offstage for a few moments  then as the audience is finally quiet continues       So the farmer said    And that s about as far as that joke got  because the audience laughed for minutes afterward   edit  The Benny Allen  feud  In 1937 Benny began his famous radio  feud  with rival Fred Allen  Allen kicked the  feud  off on his own show  after child violinist Stewart Canin gave a performance credible enough that Allen wisecracked about  a certain alleged violinist  who should by comparison be ashamed of himself  Benny  who either listened to the Allen show or was told about the crack  answered in kind on his own show  And the two comedians were off and running  For a decade  the two went at it back and forth  so convincingly that fans of either show could have been forgiven for believing they had become blood enemies  In fact  the two men were good friends and each other s greatest admirers  Benny and Allen often appeared on each other s show during the thick of the  feud   numerous surviving episodes of both comedians  radio shows feature each other  in both acknowledged guest spots and occasional cameos  Benny in his eventual memoir  Sunday Nights at Seven  and Allen in his Treadmill to Oblivion later revealed that each comedian s writing staff often met together to plot future takes on the mock feud  If Allen zapped Benny with a satirisation of Benny s show   The Pinch Penny Program    Benny shot back with a parody of Allen s early favourite  Town Hall Tonight  Benny s parody   Clown Hall Tonight   And their playful sniping   Benny was born ignorant  and he s been losing ground ever since   was also advanced in the films Love Thy Neighbor and It s in the Bag   Perhaps the climax of the  feud  came during Fred Allen s parody of popular quiz and prize show Queen for a Day  which was barely a year old when Allen decided to have a crack at it on The Fred Allen Show   an episode that has survived for today s listeners to appreciate  Calling the sketch  King for a Day   Allen played the host and Benny a contestant who sneaked onto the show using the alias Myron Proudfoot  Benny answered the prize winning question correctly and Allen crowned him  king  and showered him with a passel of almost meaningless prizes  Allen proudly announced   Tomorrow night  in your ermine robe  you will be whisked by bicycle to Orange  New Jersey  where you will be the judge in a chicken cleaning contest   To which Benny joyously declared   I m king for a day   At this point a professional pressing iron was wheeled on stage  to press Benny s suit properly  It didn t matter that Benny was still in the suit  Allen instructed his aides to remove Benny s suit  one item at a time  ending with his trousers  each garment s removal provoking louder laughter from the studio audience  As his trousers began to come off  Benny howled   Allen  you haven t seen the end of me   At once Allen shot back   It won t be long now   The laughter was so loud and chaotic at the chain of events that the Allen show announcer  Kenny Delmar  was cut off the air while trying to read a final commercial and the show s credits   Allen was notorious for running overtime often enough  largely thanks to his ad libbing talent  and he overran the clock again this time   Benny was profoundly shaken by Allen s sudden death of a heart attack in 1956  In a statement released on the day after Allen s death  Benny said   People have often asked me if Fred Allen and I were really friends in real life  My answer is always the same  You couldn t have such a long running and successful feud as we did  without having a deep and sincere friendship at the heart of it    edit  The CBS talent raid On the advice of MCA s Lew Wasserman  Jack Benny formed a holding company   Amusement Enterprises   a tax break major entertainers usually enjoyed in those years   which allowed him to bundle his entire program and personnel into a single commodity  The company also gave Benny the opportunity to produce and package other radio programs  including his 1947 summer replacement series starring Jack Paar   and invest in other entertainment ventures  including the production of a 1949 feature film  The Lucky Stiff  starring Dorothy Lamour  and as a key financial backer of the 1948 Broadway version of Mister Roberts  starring Henry Fonda  While Benny was top of the proverbial heap on NBC  CBS czar William S  Paley cast a hungry eye upon the comedian  Paley apparently had good reason to believe Benny could be had  In the summer of 1948  he successfully negotiated a deal with Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll  buying their holding company  which owned the Amos  n  Andy radio show  and the rights to those characters   moving the entire  package  from NBC to CBS that fall  he then learned that NBC balked at buying a  Jack Benny  package deal when  Jack Benny  was not the star s real name  Paley reached out to Benny and offered him a deal that would allow that package buy  But Paley  according to CBS historian Robert Metz  also learned that Benny chafed under NBC s almost indifferent attitude toward the talent that attracted the listeners  NBC  under the leadership of David Sarnoff  seemed at the time to think that listeners were listening to NBC because of NBC itself  To Paley  according to Metz  that was foolish thinking at best  Paley believed listeners were listening because of the talent  not because of which platform hosted them  When Paley said as much to Benny  the comedian agreed  Because Paley took a personal interest in the Benny negotiations  as opposed to Sarnoff who had never met his top rated star  Benny was convinced to make the jump  He convinced a number of his fellow NBC performers  notably Burns and Allen  Edgar Bergen  Red Skelton and Kate Smith  to join him  To sweeten the deal for a very nervous sponsor  Paley also agreed to make up the difference to American Tobacco if Benny s Hooper rating  the radio version of today s Nielsen ratings  on CBS fell to a certain level below his best NBC Hooper rating  Benny s CBS debut on January 2  1949 bested his top NBC rating by several points while also pumping up the ratings of the show that followed  Amos  n  Andy  NBC  with its smash Sunday night lineup now broken up  offered lucrative new deals to two of those Sunday night hits  The Fred Allen Show and The Phil Harris Alice Faye Show  Benny s bandleader and his singing actress wife now starred in their own hit sitcom  meaning Harris was featured on shows for two different networks  Benny and Sarnoff eventually met several years later and became good friends  Benny said that if he had had this kind of relationship with Sarnoff earlier  when he was Sarnoff s number one radio star  he never would have left NBC  This section may stray from the topic of the article  Please help improve this section or discuss this issue on the talk page   March 2012  Also in the late 40 s  young British comedian Alfred Hawthorne Hill became Benny Hill after his comedic hero Jack Benny   edit  Television Jack Benny and Mary Livingstone  1960  Benny first appeared on television in a brief appearance on the inaugural broadcast of Los Angeles station KTTV  Channel 11  on January 1  1949  KTTV was the Los Angeles CBS Television outlet at the time  citation needed  The television version of The Jack Benny Program ran from October 28  1950 to 1965  Initially scheduled as a series of five  specials  during the 1950 1951 season  the show appeared every six weeks for the 1951 1952 season  every four weeks for the 1952 1953 season and every three weeks in 1953 1954  For the 1953 1954 season  half the episodes were live and half were filmed during the summer  to allow Benny to continue doing his radio show  From the fall of 1954 to 1960  it appeared every other week  and from 1960 to 1965 it was seen weekly  In September 1954  CBS premiered Chrysler s Shower of Stars co hosted by Jack Benny and William Lundigan  It enjoyed a successful run from 1954 until 1958  Both television shows often overlapped the radio show  In fact  the radio show alluded frequently to its television counterparts  Often as not  Benny would sign off the radio show in such circumstances with the line  Well  good night  folks  I ll see you on television   When Benny moved to television  audiences learned that his verbal talent was matched by his controlled repertory of dead pan facial expressions and gesture  The program was similar to the radio show  several of the radio scripts were recycled for television  as was somewhat common with other radio shows that moved to television   but with the addition of visual gags  Lucky Strike was the sponsor  Benny did his opening and closing monologues before a live audience  which he regarded as essential to timing of the material  As in other TV comedy shows  canned laughter was sometimes added to  sweeten  the soundtrack  as when the studio audience missed some close up comedy because of cameras or microphones in their way  The television viewers learned to live without Mary Livingstone  who was afflicted by a striking case of stage fright  Livingstone appeared rarely if at all on the television show  for the last few years of the radio show  she pre recorded her lines and Jack and Mary s daughter  Joan  stood in for the live broadcast as the pre recordings were played   and finally retired from show business permanently in 1958  as her friend Gracie Allen had done  Benny s television program relied more on guest stars and less on his regulars than his radio program  In fact  the only radio cast members who appeared regularly on the television program as well were Don Wilson and Eddie Anderson  Day appeared sporadically  and Harris had left the radio program in 1952  although he did make a guest appearance on the television show  Bob Crosby  Phil s  replacement   frequently appeared on television through 1956   A frequent guest was the Canadian born singer violinist Gisele Mackenzie  Benny was able to attract guests who rarely  if ever  appeared on television  In 1953  both Marilyn Monroe and Humphrey Bogart made their television debuts on Benny s program  16  17  Canadian singer Gisele MacKenzie  who toured with Benny in the early 1950s  guest starred seven times on The Jack Benny Program  Benny was so impressed with MacKenzie s talents that he served as co executive producer and guest starred on her 1957 1958 NBC variety show  The Gisele MacKenzie Show  18  Benny did many television specials after leaving his regularly scheduled show  This is a promotional postcard for one of them  In 1964  Walt Disney was a guest  primarily to promote his production of Mary Poppins  Benny persuaded Disney to give him over 100 free admission tickets to Disneyland for his friends  but later in the show Disney apparently sent his pet tiger after Benny as revenge  at which point Benny opened his umbrella and soared above the stage like Mary Poppins  19  In due course the ratings game finally got to Benny  too  CBS dropped the show in 1964  citing Benny s lack of appeal to the younger demographic the network began courting  and he went to NBC  his original network  in the fall  only to be out rated by CBS s Gomer Pyle  U S M C  The network dropped Benny at the end of the season  He continued to make occasional specials into the 1970s  His last television appearance was in 1974  on a The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast for Lucille Ball  The videotaped show was telecast just a few weeks after his death  In his unpublished autobiography  I Always Had Shoes  portions of which were later incorporated by Jack s daughter  Joan  into her memoir of her parents  Sunday Nights at Seven   Benny said that he  not NBC  made the decision to end his TV series in 1965  He said that while the ratings were still very good  he cited a figure of some 18 million viewers per week  although he qualified that figure by saying he never believed the ratings services were doing anything more than guessing  no matter what they promised   advertisers were complaining that commercial time on his show was costing nearly twice as much as what they paid for most other shows  and he had grown tired of what was called the  rate race   Thus  after some three decades on radio and television in a weekly program  Jack Benny went out on top  In fairness  Benny himself shared Fred Allen s ambivalence about television  though not quite to Allen s extent   By my second year in television  I saw that the camera was a man eating monster   It gave a performer close up exposure that  week after week  threatened his existence as an interesting entertainer   8  In a joint appearance with Phil Silvers on Dick Cavett s show  Benny recalled that he had advised Silvers not to appear on television  However  Silvers ignored Benny s advice and proceeded to win several Emmy awards as Sergeant Bilko on the popular series The Phil Silvers Show  while Benny claimed he never won any of the television honors   edit  Filmography See Jack Benny filmography  edit  Movies Benny also acted in movies  including the Academy Award winning The Hollywood Revue of 1929  Broadway Melody of 1936  as a benign nemesis for Eleanor Powell and Robert Taylor   George Washington Slept Here  1942   and notably  Charley s Aunt and To Be or Not to Be  He and Livingstone also appeared in Ed Sullivan s Mr  Broadway  1933  as themselves  Benny often parodied contemporary movies and movie genres on the radio program  and the 1940 film Buck Benny Rides Again features all the main radio characters in a funny Western parody adapted from program skits  The failure of one Benny vehicle  The Horn Blows at Midnight  became a running gag on his radio and television programs  although contemporary viewers may not find the film as disappointing as the jokes suggest  Benny may have had an unbilled cameo role in Casablanca  claimed by a contemporary newspaper advertisement 20  and reportedly in the Casablanca press book 21    When asked in his column  Movie Answer Man   critic Roger Ebert first replied   It looks something like him  That s all I can say   21  In response to a follow up question in his next column  he stated   I think you re right   22  Benny also was caricatured in several Warner Brothers cartoons including Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur  1939  as Casper the Caveman   I Love to Singa  Slap Happy Pappy  and Goofy Groceries  1936  1940  and 1941 respectively  as Jack Bunny 23    Malibu Beach Party  1940  as himself   24  and The Mouse that Jack Built  1959   The last of these is probably the most memorable  Robert McKimson engaged Benny and his actual cast  Mary Livingstone  Eddie Anderson  and Don Wilson  to do the voices for the mouse versions of their characters  with Mel Blanc the usual Warner Brothers cartoon voicemeister reprising his old vocal turn as the always aging Maxwell  always a phat phat bang  away from collapse  In the cartoon  Benny and Livingstone agree to spend their anniversary at the Kit Kat Club  which they discover the hard way is inside the mouth of a live cat  Before the cat can devour the mice  Benny himself awakens from his dream  then shakes his head  smiles wryly  and mutters   Imagine  me and Mary as little mice   Then  he glances toward the cat lying on a throw rug in a corner and sees his and Livingstone s cartoon alter egos scampering out of the cat s mouth  The cartoon ends with a classic Benny look of befuddlement  It was rumored that Benny requested that  in lieu of monetary compensation  he receive a copy of the finished film   edit  Running gags Jack Benny rehearses with members of the California Junior Symphony Orchestra  1959 Benny teamed with Fred Allen for the best remembered running gag in classic radio history  in terms of character dialogue  But Benny alone sustained a classic repertoire of running gags in his own right  including a skinflint radio and television persona  a perpetual listed age of 39  and ineptitude at violin playing  most frequently demonstrated by futile attempts to perform Rodolphe Kreutzer s Etude No  2 in C major  A skit heard numerous times on radio  and seen many times on television  had Mel Blanc as a Mexican in a sombrero and serape sitting on a bench  Jack Benny sits down and begins a conversation  To each question asked by Benny  Blanc replies Si  When Benny asks his name  Blanc replies Sy  which would prompt the exchange  Sy   Si  And when Benny asks where Blanc is going  Blanc replies   to see his sister   Sue  Sue   Si    who of course sews for a living  Sew   Si    A running gag in Benny s private life concerned George Burns  To Benny s eternal frustration  he could never get Burns to laugh  Burns  on the other hand  could crack Benny up with the least effort  An example of this occurred at a party when Benny pulled out a match to light a cigar  Burns announced to all   Jack Benny will now perform the famous match trick   Benny had no idea what Burns was talking about  so he proceeded to light up  Burns observed   Oh  a new ending   and Benny collapsed in helpless laughter  Benny even had a sound based running gag of his own  his famous basement vault alarm  allegedly installed by Spike Jones  ringing off with a shattering cacophony of whistles  sirens  bells  and blasts  before ending invariably with the sound of a foghorn  The alarm rang off even when Benny opened his safe with the correct combination  The vault also featured a guard named Ed  voiced by Joseph Kearns  who had been on post down below before  apparently  the end of the Civil War  the end of the Revolutionary War  the founding of Los Angeles  on Jack s 38th birthday  and even the beginning of humanity  In one appearance  Ed asked Benny   By the way  Mr  Benny   what s it like on the outside   Benny responded      winter is nearly here  and the leaves are falling   Ed responded   Hey  that must be exciting   To which Benny replied  in a stunningly risqu  joke for the period    Oh  no people are wearing clothes now   In one episode of the Benny radio show  Ed the Guard actually agreed when Jack invited him to take a break and come back to the surface world  only to discover that modern conveniences and transportation  which hadn t been around the last time he d been to the surface  terrorized and confused him   Poor Ed thought a crosstown bus was  a red and yellow dragon    Finally  Ed decides to return to his post fathoms below and stay there  The basement vault gag was also used in the cartoon The Mouse that Jack Built and an episode 25  of The Lucy Show  A separate sound gag involved a song Benny had written   When You Say I Beg Your Pardon  Then I ll Come Back to You   Its inane lyrics and insipid melody guaranteed that it would never be published or recorded  but Benny continued to try to con  extort  or otherwise inveigle some of his musical guests  including The Smothers Brothers and Peter  Paul and Mary  to perform it  None ever made it all the way through  In keeping with his  stingy  schtick  on one of his television specials he remarked that  to his way of looking at things  a  special  is when the price of coffee is marked down  The explanation usually given for the  stuck on 39  running joke is that he had celebrated his birthday on air when he turned 39  and decided to do the same the following year  because  there s nothing funny about 40   Upon his death  having celebrated his 39th birthday 41 times  some newspapers continued the joke with headlines such as  Jack Benny Dies   At 39   Another popular running gag concerned the social habits of Benny s on air orchestra  who were consistently portrayed as a bunch of drunken ne er do wells  Led first by Phil Harris and later by Bob Crosby  the orchestra  and in particular band member Frank Remley  were jokingly portrayed as often being too drunk to play properly  using an overturned bass drum to play cards on just minutes before a show  and so enamored by liquor that the sight of a glass of milk would make them sick  Remley was portrayed in various unflattering situations  such as being thrown into a garbage can by a road sweeper who had found him passed out in the street at 4 am  and on a wanted poster at the Beverly Hills police station  Crosby also got consistent laughs by frequently joking about his more famous brother Bing s vast wealth   edit  The Maxwell Jack Benny shakes hands with Harry S  Truman from the seat of a c  1908 Maxwell Roadster Starting on the radio show  a running joke was that Benny drove a Maxwell automobile  a brand that went out of business in 1925  Benny s old car was so worn out that it would barely run  but the miserly Benny insisted he could get a few more miles out of it  When a sound effects man missed a cue for the automobile engine  Mel Blanc quickly improvised a vocal imitation of a sputtering car engine that was so funny it became a regular feature of the show  By 1943  Jack Benny s Maxwell had become such a well known aspect of popular culture that it was referenced in the Spike Jones record  The Sound Effects Man   When the Jack Benny Program began appearing on television in 1950  a 1916 Maxwell Model 25 Tourer became one of the production s standard props  Benny s Maxwell later became a 1923 Tourer  In addition to on the program  Benny would often make public appearances in Maxwells  He appeared behind the wheel of one in the film It s a Mad  Mad  Mad  Mad World and drove a Maxwell onto the stage in one of his last television specials  Benny and his archaic auto were featured in a series of television and print ads for Texaco from the 1950s through the 1970s  A series of gags were built around the premise that Benny appreciated the value of  Sky Chief  brand gasoline in keeping his car running smoothly  but was too cheap to buy more than one gallon at a time   edit  Final years A mod Benny from his January 1974 special  After his broadcasting career ended  Benny performed live as a stand up comedian and returned to films in 1963 with a cameo appearance in It s a Mad  Mad  Mad  Mad World  Benny was preparing to star in the film version of Neil Simon s The Sunshine Boys when his health failed  In fact  he prevailed upon his longtime best friend  George Burns  to take his place on a nightclub tour while preparing for the film   Burns ultimately had to replace Benny in the film as well and went on to win an Academy Award for his performance   Benny made one of his final television appearances in the fall of 1972 on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson when Carson celebrated his 10th anniversary   An audio recording featuring highlights of Benny s appearance is featured on the album Here s Johnny  Magic Moments From The Tonight Show released in 1973   During this appearance  he stated that he loved the violin so much   if God came to me and said  Jack  starting tomorrow I will make you one of the world s great violinists  but no more will you ever be able to tell a joke   I really believe that I would accept that   He also related something Isaac Stern once told him   You know  Jack  when you walk out in front of a symphony orchestra in white tie and tails and your violin  you actually look like one of the world s great violinists  It s a damned shame you have to play   Jokes aside  Benny was a serious  dedicated violinist who could play aside Stern and not embarrass himself  26   edit  Death In October 1974  Benny canceled a performance in Dallas after suffering a dizzy spell  coupled with numbness in his arms  Despite a battery of tests  Benny s ailment could not be determined  When he complained of stomach pains in early December  a first test showed nothing  but a subsequent one showed he had inoperable pancreatic cancer  Choosing to spend his final days at home  he was visited by close friends including George Burns  Bob Hope  Frank Sinatra  Johnny Carson and John Rowles  He died on December 26  1974  George Burns  Benny s best friend for more than fifty years  attempted to deliver a eulogy  He broke down shortly after he began and was unable to continue  Bob Hope also delivered a eulogy in which he stated   This is the only time Jack s timing was all wrong  He left us much too soon   Two days after his death  he was interred in a crypt at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City  California  Benny s will arranged for flowers  specifically a single long stemmed red rose  to be delivered to his widow  Mary Livingstone  every day for the rest of her life  Livingstone died nine years later on June 30  1983  In trying to explain his successful life  Benny summed it up by stating  Everything good that happened to me happened by accident  I was not filled with ambition nor fired by a drive toward a clear cut goal  I never knew exactly where I was going   8  Upon his death  his family donated to UCLA his personal  professional  and business papers  as well as a collection of his television shows  The university established the Jack Benny Award in his honor in 1977 to recognize outstanding people in the field of comedy  Johnny Carson was the first award recipient  27  Benny also donated a Stradivarius violin purchased in 1957 to the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra  28  29  Benny had commented   If it isn t a  30 000 Strad  I m out  120   30   edit  Honors Jack Benny has one star each on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for TV  film  and radio   edit  Posthumous tributes When the price of a standard first class US postal stamp was increased to 39 cents in 2006  fans petitioned for a Jack Benny stamp to honor his stage persona s perpetual age  The U S  Postal Service had issued a stamp depicting Jack Benny in 1991  as part of a booklet of stamps honoring comedians  however  the stamp was issued at the then current rate of 29 cents  Jack Benny Middle School in Waukegan  Illinois  is named after the famous comedian  Its motto matches his famous statement as  Home of the  39ers
