consensus of definition among scholars or devotees  its origin is an open question  Some offer works like the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh  earliest Sumerian text versions BCE ca  2150 2000  as the primal text of science fiction  Others argue that science fiction began in the late Middle Ages  1  or that science fiction became possible only with the Scientific Revolution  notably discoveries by Galileo and Newton in astronomy  physics  and mathematics  Some place the origin with the gothic novel Frankenstein  Science fiction developed and boomed in the 20th century  as the deep penetration of science and inventions into society created an interest in literature that explored technology s influence on people and society  Today  science fiction has significant influence on world culture

science fiction  edit  Early precursors The Epic of Gilgamesh There have been attempts by various historians to claim an ancient history for the genre of science fiction  This claim is now a minority opinion  with the majority placing these works at best as examples of proto science fiction  citation needed Lester del Rey has stated that the first work of science fiction was the first recorded work of literature  The Epic of Gilgamesh  earliest Sumerian text versions BCE ca  2150 2000   Gilgamesh features a flood scene that in some ways resembles work of apocalyptic science fiction  however  it is probably better categorized as fantastic literature  as there is little of science or technology in it  citation needed Greek works with science fiction like elements include   besides Lucian s True History   Aristophanes  The Clouds and The Birds  and Plato s descriptions of Atlantis  Early elements of science fiction are also found in ancient Indian epics such as the Ramayana  which had mythical Vimana flying machines that were able to fly within the Earth s atmosphere  and able to travel into space and travel submerged under water  along with a weapon which could destroy an entire city  The ancient Hindu mythological epic  the Mahabharatha  mentions the story of the King Revaita  who travels to heaven to meet the creator Brahma and is shocked to learn that many ages have passed when he returns to Earth  anticipating the concept of time travel  2  3  Portions of the Biblical text  Revelation  4  read literally like science fiction and science fantasy   There was a great earthquake  The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair  the whole moon turned blood red  and the stars in the sky fell to earth  as figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind  The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up  and every mountain and island was removed from its place   5  The first page of Beowulf Works of fantastic literature from Ovid s Metamorphoses telling of Daedalus and Icarus to Beowulf and the Nibelungenlied to Dante s The Divine Comedy and Shakespeare s The Tempest have also been claimed to contain science fictional elements  The Tempest contains one Renaissance prototype for the mad scientist story  the Faust legend is another   and it was adapted as the science fiction film Forbidden Planet  In the Divine Comedy  Dante travels to other planets and Stars  which make up heaven and are inhabitated by different peoples  for example  Mars with the souls of martyrs  citation needed  L  Sprague de Camp and a number of other authors cite Lucian s 2nd century satirical True History about an interplanetary trip as an early  if not the earliest  example of science fiction or proto science fiction  6  7  8  9  10  The position of the English critic Kingsley Amis seems ambivalent  While he wrote that  It is hardly science fiction  since it deliberately piles extravagance upon extravagance for comic effect   citation needed  he implicitly acknowledged its SF character by comparing its plot to early 20th century space operas   I will merely remark that the sprightliness and sophistication of True History make it read like a joke at the expense of nearly all early modern science fiction  that written between  say  1910 and 1940   11  Typical science fiction themes and topoi in True History include  7  travel to outer space  encounter with alien life forms  including the experience of a first encounter event  interplanetary warfare and imperialism  colonization of planets  motif of giganticism  creatures as products of human technology  robot theme   worlds working by a set of alternate  physical  laws and an explicit desire of the protagonist for exploration and adventure  Kaguya hime returning to the Moon in The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter The early Japanese tale of  Urashima Tar   involves traveling forwards in time to a distant future  12  and was first described in the Nihongi  720   13  It was about a young fisherman named Urashima Taro who visits an undersea palace and stays there for three days  After returning home to his village  he finds himself three hundred years in the future  where he is long forgotten  his house in ruins  and his family long dead  12  The 10th century Japanese narrative The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter may also be considered proto science fiction  The protagonist of the story  Kaguya hime  is a princess from the Moon who is sent to Earth for safety during a celestial war  and is found and raised by a bamboo cutter in Japan  She is later taken back to the Moon by her real extraterrestrial family  A manuscript illustration depicts a round flying machine similar to a flying saucer  14  Arabic manuscript of the One Thousand and One Nights Several stories within the One Thousand and One Nights  Arabian Nights  also feature science fiction elements  One example is  The Adventures of Bulukiya   where the protagonist Bulukiya s quest for the herb of immortality leads him to explore the seas  journey to the Garden of Eden and to Jahannam  and travel across the cosmos to different worlds much larger than his own world  anticipating elements of galactic science fiction  15  along the way  he encounters societies of jinns  16 mermaids  talking serpents  talking trees  and other forms of life  15  In  Abdullah the Fisherman and Abdullah the Merman   the protagonist gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater submarine society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land  in that the underwater society follows a form of primitive communism where concepts like money and clothing do not exist  Other Arabian Nights tales deal with lost ancient technologies  advanced ancient civilizations that went astray  and catastrophes which overwhelmed them  17   The City of Brass  features a group of travellers on an archaeological expedition 18  across the Sahara to find an ancient lost city and attempt to recover a brass vessel that Solomon once used to trap a jinn  19  and  along the way  encounter a mummified queen  petrified inhabitants  20  life like humanoid robots and automata  seductive marionettes dancing without strings  21  and a brass horseman robot who directs the party towards the ancient city   The Ebony Horse  features a robot 22  in the form of a flying mechanical horse controlled using keys that could fly into outer space and towards the Sun  23  while the  Third Qalandar s Tale  also features a robot in the form of an uncanny boatman  22   The City of Brass  and  The Ebony Horse  can be considered early examples of proto science fiction  14  24  Other examples of early Arabic proto science fiction include Al Farabi s Opinions of the residents of a splendid city about a utopian society  Al Qazwini s futuristic tale of Awaj bin Anfaq about a man who travelled to Earth from a distant planet  and certain Arabian Nights elements such as the flying carpet  25  According to Roubi  1  the final two chapters of the Arabic theological novel F dil ibn N tiq  c  1270   also known as Theologus Autodidactus  by the Arabian polymath writer Ibn al Nafis  1213 1288  can be described as science fiction  The theological novel deals with various science fiction elements such as spontaneous generation  futurology  apocalyptic themes  eschatology  resurrection and the afterlife  but rather than giving supernatural or mythological explanations for these events  Ibn al Nafis attempted to explain these plot elements using his own extensive scientific knowledge in anatomy  biology  physiology  astronomy  cosmology and geology  For example  it was through this novel that Ibn al Nafis introduces his scientific theory of metabolism  1  and he makes references to his own scientific discovery of the pulmonary circulation in order to explain bodily resurrection  26  The novel was later translated into English as Theologus Autodidactus in the early 20th century   edit  European proto science fiction Literature that resembles modern science fiction emerged in Europe from the 16th century  The discoveries in the sciences and the dawning of the Enlightenment inspired literature informed by these advances  One of the earliest instances is the superior country imagined in Thomas More s 1516 novel Utopia  More s name for a perfect world would be borrowed by many later science fiction writers  and the Utopia motif is a common one in science fiction  It is notable that More and Francis Bacon  leading humanist and philosopher of science  wrote works of proto science fiction  Bacon s fantasy The New Atlantis was published in 1627  The Age of Reason followed scientific developments that gave speculative writers ideas for their stories  Imaginary voyages to the moon in the 17th century  first in Johannes Kepler s Somnium  The Dream  1634   and then in Francis Godwin s The Man in the Moone  1638  arguably the first work of science fiction in English  and in Cyrano de Bergerac s Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon  1656   27  Space travel also figures prominently in Voltaire s Microm gas  1752   which is also notable for the suggestion that people of other worlds may be in some ways more advanced than those of earth  Other early works of significance include the alternate world found in the Arctic by a young noblewoman in Margaret Cavendish s 1666 novel  The Description of a New World  Called the Blazing World  the account of life in the future in Louis S bastien Mercier s L An 2440  and the descriptions of alien cultures and  weird science  in Jonathan Swift s Gulliver s Travels  1726  and in Ludvig Holberg s Niels Klim s Underground Travels  an early example of the Hollow Earth genre  In 1733  Samuel Madden wrote Memoirs Of the Twentieth Century  in which the narrator in 1728 is given a series of state documents from 1997 1998 by his guardian angel  a plot device which is reminiscent of later time travel novels although the story does not explain how the angel obtained these documents  Simon Tyssot de Patot s Voyages et Aventures de Jacques Mass   1710  features a Lost World and his La Vie  Les Aventures et Le Voyage de Groenland du R v rend P re Cordelier Pierre de M sange  1720  features a Hollow Earth  Nicolas Edm  Restif de la Bretonne s La D couverte Australe par un Homme Volant  1781  features prophetic inventions  Mary Shelley s Frankenstein  1818  features the archetypal  mad scientist  experimenting with advanced technology  28  In his book Billion Year Spree  Brian Aldiss claims Frankenstein represents  the first seminal work to which the label SF can be logically attached   It is also the first of the  mad scientist  subgenre  Although normally associated with the gothic horror genre  the novel introduces science fiction themes such as the use of technology for achievements beyond the scope of science at the time  and the alien as antagonist  furnishing a view of the human condition from an outside perspective  Aldiss argues that science fiction in general derives its conventions from the gothic novel  Mary Shelley s short story  Roger Dodsworth  The Reanimated Englishman   1826  sees a man frozen in ice revived in the present day  incorporating the now common science fiction theme of cryonics whilst also exemplifying Shelley s use of science as a conceit to drive her stories  Another futuristic Shelley novel  The Last Man  is also often cited as the first true science fiction novel  28  In 1835 Edgar Allan Poe published a short story   The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall  in which a flight to the moon in a balloon is described  It has an account of the launch  the construction of the cabin  descriptions of strata and many more science like aspects  29  In addition to Poe s account the story written in 1813 by the Dutch Willem Bilderdijk is remarkable  In his novel Kort verhaal van eene aanmerkelijke luchtreis en nieuwe planeetontdekking  Short account of a remarkable journey into the skies and discovery of a new planet  Bilderdijk tells of a European somewhat stranded in an Arabic country where he boasts he is able to build a balloon that can lift people and let them fly through the air  The gasses used turn out to be far more powerful than expected and after a while he lands on a planet positioned between earth and moon  The writer uses the story to portray an overview of scientific knowledge concerning the moon in all sorts of aspects the traveller to that place would encounter  Quite a few similarities can be found in the story Poe published some twenty years later  In 1836 Alexander Veltman published Predki Kalimerosa  Aleksandr Filippovich Makedonskii  The forebears of Kalimeros  Alexander  son of Philip of Macedon   which has been called the first original Russian science fiction novel and the first novel to use time travel  30  In it the narrator rides to ancient Greece on a hippogriff  meets Aristotle  and goes on a voyage with Alexander the Great before returning to the 19th century  Somehow influenced by the scientific theories of 19th century  but most certainly by the idea of human progress  Victor Hugo wrote in The Legend of the Centuries  1859  a long poem in two part that can be viewed like a dystopia utopia fiction  called 20th century  It shows in a first scene the body of a broken huge ship  the greatest product of the prideful and foolish mankind that called it Leviathan  wandering in a desert world where the winds blow and the anger of the wounded Nature is  humanity  finally reunited and pacified  has gone toward the stars in a starship  to look for and to bring liberty into the light  Other notable proto science fiction authors and works of the early 19th century include  Jean Baptiste Cousin de Grainville s Le Dernier Homme  1805  The Last Man   Historian F lix Bodin s Le Roman de l Avenir  1834  and Emile Souvestre s Le Monde Tel Qu il Sera  1846   two novels which try to predict what the next century will be like  Jane C  Loudon s The Mummy   A Tale of the Twenty Second Century  1836   in which Cheops is revived by scientific means into a world in political crisis  where technology has advanced to gas flame jewelry and houses that migrate on rails   amp c  Louis Geoffroy s Napoleon et la Conqu te du Monde  1836   an alternate history of a world conquered by Napoleon  C I  Defontenay s Star ou Psi de Cassiop e  1854   an Olaf Stapledon like chronicle of an alien world and civilization  Astronomer Camille Flammarion s La Pluralit  des Mondes Habit s  1862  which speculated on extraterrestrial life  Edward Bulwer Lytton s The Coming Race  1871   a novel where the main character discovers a highly evolved subterranean civilization   edit  Verne and Wells See also  Scientific romance Jules Verne H  G  Wells The European brand of science fiction proper began later in the 19th century with the scientific romances of Jules Verne and the science oriented novels of social criticism of H  G  Wells  31  Verne s adventure stories  notably A Journey to the Center of the Earth  1864   From the Earth to the Moon  1865   and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea  1869  mixed daring romantic adventure with technology that was either up to the minute or logically extrapolated into the future  They were tremendous commercial successes and established that an author could make a career out of such whimsical material  L  Sprague de Camp calls Verne  the world s first full time science fiction novelist   Wells s stories  on the other hand  use science fiction devices to make didactic points about his society  In The Time Machine  1895   for example  the technical details of the machine are glossed over quickly so that the Time Traveller can tell a story that criticizes the stratification of English society  The story also uses Darwinian evolution  as would be expected in a former student of Darwin s champion  Huxley   and shows an awareness  and criticism  of Marxism  In The War of the Worlds  1898   the Martians  technology is not explained as it would have been in a Verne story  and the story is resolved by a deus ex machina  The differences between Verne and Wells highlight a tension that would exist in science fiction throughout its history  The question of whether to present realistic technology or to focus on characters and ideas has been ever present  as has the question of whether to tell an exciting story or make a didactic point  Leaving the opera in the year 2000  hand coloured lithograph by Albert Robida  late 19th century  Wells and Verne had quite a few rivals in early science fiction  Short stories and novelettes with themes of fantastic imagining appeared in journals throughout the late 19th century and many of these employed scientific ideas as the springboard to the imagination  Erewhon is a novel by Samuel Butler published in 1872 and dealing with the concept that machines could one day become sentient and supplant the human race  Although better known for Sherlock Holmes  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle also wrote early science fiction  particularly using the character of Professor Challenger  as did Rudyard Kipling and Bangla science fiction writers such as Roy Rodgers and Begum Roquia Sakhawat Hussain  who wrote the earliest known feminist science fiction work  Sultana s Dream  Another early feminist science fiction work at the time was Charlotte Perkins Gilman  Herland  Wells and Verne both had an international readership and influenced writers in America  especially  Soon a home grown American science fiction was thriving  European writers found more readers by selling to the American market and writing in an Americanised style   edit  American proto science fiction In the last decades of the 19th century  works of science fiction for adults and children were numerous in America  though it was not yet given the name  science fiction   There were science fiction elements in the stories of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Fitz James O Brien  Edgar Allan Poe is often mentioned with Verne and Wells as the founders of science fiction  A number of his short stories  and the novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket are science fictional  An 1827 satiric novel by philosopher George Tucker A Voyage to the Moon is sometimes cited as the first American science fiction novel  32  One of the most successful works of early American science fiction was the second best selling novel in the U S  in the 19th century  Edward Bellamy s Looking Backward  1888   its effects extending far beyond the field of literature  Looking Backward extrapolates a future society based on observation of the current society  In 1894  Will Harben published  Land of the Changing Sun   a dystopian fantasy set at the center of the earth  In Harben s tale  the earth s core is populated by a scientifically advanced civilization  living beneath the glow of a mechanical sun  Mark Twain explored themes of science in his novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur s Court  By means of  transmigration of souls    transposition of epochs   and bodies  Twain s Yankee is transported back in time and his knowledge of 19th century technology with him  Written in 1889  A Connecticut Yankee seems to predict the events of World War I  when Europe s old ideas of chivalry in warfare were shattered by new weapons and tactics  American author L  Frank Baum s series of 14 books  1900 1920  based in his outlandish Land of Oz setting  contained depictions of strange weapons  Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz  Glinda of Oz   mechanical men  Tik Tok of Oz  and a bevy of not yet realized technological inventions and devices including perhaps the first literary appearance of handheld wireless communicators  Tik Tok of Oz   Jack London wrote several science fiction stories  including The Red One  a story involving extraterrestrials   The Iron Heel  set in the future from London s point of view  and The Unparalleled Invasion  a story involving future germ warfare and ethnic cleansing   He also wrote a story about invisibility and a story about an irresistible energy weapon  These stories began to change the features of science fiction  Edward Everett Hale wrote The Brick Moon  a Verne inspired novel notable as the first work to describe an artificial satellite  Written in much the same style as his other work  it employs pseudojournalistic realism to tell an adventure story with little basis in reality  Edgar Rice Burroughs  1875 1950  began writing science fiction for pulp magazines just before World War I  getting his first story Under the Moons of Mars published in 1912  He continued to publish adventure stories  many of them science fiction  throughout the rest of his life  The pulps published adventure stories of all kinds  Science fiction stories had to fit in alongside murder mysteries  horror  fantasy and Edgar Rice Burroughs  own Tarzan   edit  Early 20th century The next great science fiction writers after H  G  Wells were Olaf Stapledon  1886 to 1950   whose four major works Last and First Men  1930   Odd John  1935   Star Maker  1937   and Sirius  1940   introduced a myriad of ideas that writers have since adopted  and J  H  Rosny a n   born in Belgium  the father of  modern  French science fiction  a writer also comparable to H  G  Wells  who wrote the classic Les Xipehuz  1887  and La Mort de la Terre  1910   However  the Twenties and Thirties would see the genre represented in a new format   edit  Birth of the pulps See also  Pulp magazine The development of American science fiction as a self conscious genre dates in part from 1926  when Hugo Gernsback founded Amazing Stories magazine  which was devoted exclusively to science fiction stories  33  Though science fiction magazines had been published in Sweden and Germany before  Amazing Stories was the first English language magazine to solely publish science fiction  Since he is notable for having chosen the variant term scientifiction to describe this incipient genre  the stage in the genre s development  his name and the term  scientifiction  are often thought to be inextricably linked  Though Gernsback encouraged stories featuring scientific realism to educate his readers about scientific principles  such stories shared the pages with exciting stories with little basis in reality  Film poster for Metropolis Published in this and other pulp magazines with great and growing success  such scientifiction stories were not viewed as serious literature but as sensationalism  Nevertheless  a magazine devoted entirely to science fiction was a great boost to the public awareness of the scientific speculation story  Amazing Stories competed with several other pulp magazines  including Weird Tales  which primarily published fantasy stories   Astounding Stories  and Wonder Stories  throughout the 1930s  It was in the Gernsback era that science fiction fandom arose through the medium of the  Letters to the Editor  columns of Amazing and its competitors  Fritz Lang s movie Metropolis  1927   in which the first cinematic humanoid robot was seen  and the Italian Futurists  love of machines are indicative of both the hopes and fears of the world between the big European wars  Metropolis was an extremely successful film and its art deco inspired aesthetic became the guiding aesthetic of the science fiction pulps for some time   edit  Modernist writing Writers attempted to respond to the new world in the post World War I era  In the 1920s and 30s writers entirely unconnected with science fiction were exploring new ways of telling a story and new ways of treating time  space and experience in the narrative form  The posthumously published works of Franz Kafka  who died in 1924  and the works of modernist writers such as James Joyce  T  S  Eliot  Virginia Woolf and others featured stories in which time and individual identity could be expanded  contracted  looped and otherwise distorted  While this work was unconnected to science fiction as a genre  it did deal with the impact of modernity  technology  science  and change  upon people s lives  and decades later  during the New Wave movement  some modernist literary techniques entered science fiction  Czech playwright Karel  apek s plays The Makropulos Affair  R U R   The Life of the Insects  and the novel War with the Newts were modernist literature which invented important science fiction motifs  R U R  in particular is noted for introducing the word robot to the world s vocabulary  A strong theme in modernist writing was alienation  the making strange of familiar surroundings so that settings and behaviour usually regarded as  normal  are seen as though they were the seemingly bizarre practices of an alien culture  The audience of modernist plays or the readership of modern novels is often led to question everything  At the same time  a tradition of more literary science fiction novels  treating with a dissonance between perceived Utopian conditions and the full expression of human desires  began to develop  the dystopian novel  For some time  the science fictional elements of these works were ignored by mainstream literary critics  though they owe a much greater debt to the science fiction genre than the modernists do  Sincerely Utopian writing  including much of Wells  has also deeply influenced science fiction  beginning with Hugo Gernsback s Ralph 124C 41   Yevgeny Zamyatin s 1920 novel We depicts a totalitarian attempt to create a utopia that results in a dystopic state where free will is lost  Aldous Huxley bridged the gap between the literary establishment and the world of science fiction with Brave New World  1932   an ironic portrait of a stable and ostensibly happy society built by human mastery of genetic manipulation  In the late 1930s  John W  Campbell became editor of Astounding Science Fiction  and a critical mass of new writers emerged in New York City in a group of science fiction fans  many of whom soon became professional writers  called the Futurians  which included Isaac Asimov  Damon Knight  Donald A  Wollheim  Frederik Pohl  James Blish  Judith Merril  and others  34  Other important writers during this period included Robert A  Heinlein  Arthur C  Clarke  and A  E  van Vogt  Campbell s tenure at Astounding is considered to be the beginning of the Golden Age of science fiction  characterized by hard science fiction stories celebrating scientific achievement and progress  33  This lasted until postwar technological advances  new magazines like Galaxy under Pohl as editor  and a new generation of writers began writing stories outside the Campbell mode  George Orwell wrote perhaps the most highly regarded of these literary dystopias  Nineteen Eighty Four  in 1948  He envisions a technologically governed totalitarian regime that dominates society through total information control  Zamyatin s We is recognized as an influence on both Huxley and Orwell  Orwell published a book review of We shortly after it was first published in English  several years before writing 1984  Ray Bradbury s Fahrenheit 451  Ursula K  Le Guin s The Dispossed An Ambiguous Utopia  much of Kurt Vonnegut s writing  and many other works of later science fiction continue this dialogue between utopia and dystopia   edit  Science fiction s impact on the public Orson Welles  Mercury Theatre produced a radio version of The War of the Worlds which  famously  panicked large numbers of people who believed the program to be a real newscast  35  Revisionist  claims cast doubt as to how much anecdotes of mass panic had any reflection in reality  Inarguably  though  the idea of visitors or invaders from outer space became embedded in the consciousness of everyday people  During World War II  pilots speculated as to the origins of the  Foo fighters  they saw around them in the air  Meanwhile  the Germans had developed flying bombs known as V1s and V2s reminiscent of the  rocket ships  ever present in pulp science fiction  presaging space flight  Jet planes and the atom bomb were developed   Deadline   a Cleve Cartmill short story about a ficitonal atomic bomb project prompted the FBI to visit the offices of Astounding Science Fiction  When the story of a flying saucer crash in Roswell  New Mexico in 1947  science fiction had become modern folklore   edit  The Golden Age See also  Golden Age of Science Fiction The period of the 1940s and 1950s is often referred to as the Golden Age of Science Fiction   edit  Astounding Magazine With the emergence in 1937 of a demanding editor  John W  Campbell  Jr   at Astounding Science Fiction  and with the publication of stories and novels by such writers as Isaac Asimov  Arthur C  Clarke  and Robert A  Heinlein  science fiction began to gain status as serious fiction  Campbell exercised an extraordinary influence over the work of his stable of writers  thus shaping the direction of science fiction  Asimov wrote   We were extensions of himself  we were his literary clones   Under Campbell s direction  the years from 1938 1950 would become known as the  Golden Age of science fiction   33  though Asimov points out that the term Golden Age has been used more loosely to refer to other periods in science fiction s history  Campbell s guidance to his writers included his famous dictum   Write me a creature that thinks as well as a man  or better than a man  but not like a man   He emphasized a higher quality of writing than editors before him  giving special attention to developing the group of young writers who attached themselves to him  Ventures into the genre by writers who were not devoted exclusively to science fiction also added respectability  Magazine covers of bug eyed monsters and scantily clad women  however  preserved the image of a sensational genre appealing only to adolescents  There was a public desire for sensation  a desire of people to be taken out of their dull lives to the worlds of space travel and adventure  An interesting footnote to Campbell s regime is his contribution to the rise of L  Ron Hubbard s religion Scientology  Hubbard was considered a promising science fiction writer and a protege of Campbell  who published Hubbard s first articles about Dianetics and his new religion  As Campbell s reign as editor of Astounding progressed  Campbell gave more attention to ideas like Hubbard s  writing editorials in support of Dianetics  Though Astounding continued to have a loyal fanbase  readers started turning to other magazines to find science fiction stories   edit  The Golden Age in other media With the new source material provided by the Golden Age writers  advances in special effects  and a public desire for material that treated with the advances in technology of the time  all the elements were in place to create significant works of science fiction film  As a result  science fiction film came into its own in the 1950s  producing films like Destination Moon  Them   Invasion of the Body Snatchers  Forbidden Planet  and many others  Many of these movies were based on stories by Campbell s writers  The Thing was adapted from a Campbell story  Them and Invasion of the Body Snatchers were based on Jack Finney novels  Destination Moon on a Heinlein novel  and The Beast from 20 000 Fathoms was derived from a Ray Bradbury short story  John Wyndham s cosy catastrophes  including The Day of the Triffids and The Kraken Wakes  provided important source material as well  At the same time  science fiction began to appear on a new medium   television  In 1953 The Quatermass Experiment was shown on British television  the first significant science fiction show  though it could also be described as horror  citation needed  In the United States  science fiction heroes like Captain Video  Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers were shown  programs that more closely resembled pre Campbellian science fiction   edit  End of the Golden Age Seeking greater freedom of expression  writers started to publish their articles in other magazines  including The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction  If  a resurrected Amazing Stories  and most notably  Galaxy  Under editors H L  Gold and then Frederik Pohl  Galaxy stressed a more literary form of science fiction that took cues from more mainstream literature  It was less insistent on scientific plausibility than Campbell s Astounding  The rise of Galaxy signaled the end of Golden Age science fiction  though most of the Golden Age writers were able to adapt to the changes in the genre and keep writing  Some  however  moved to other fields  Isaac Asimov and several others began to write scientific fact almost exclusively   edit  The New Wave and its aftermath  edit  Precursors to the New Wave Samuel Beckett s The Unnamable and Waiting for Godot were influential upon writing in the 1950s  In the former all sense of place and time are dispensed with  all that remains is a voice poised between the urge to continue existing and the urge to find silence and oblivion   The only other major writer to use  The Unnamable  as a title was H  P  Lovecraft   In the latter  time and the paradoxes of cause and effect become thematic  Beckett s influence on the intelligentia as well as the general influence of existentialism and the legal battles to publish books then classified as obscene made science fiction more sophisticated  especially in Britain  William S  Burroughs  1914 1997  was the writer who finally brought science fiction together with the modernist trend in literature  With the help of Jack Kerouac Burroughs published Naked Lunch  the first of a series of novels employing a semi dadaistic technique called the Cut up and modernistic deconstructions of conventional society  pulling away the mask of normality to reveal nothingness beneath  Burroughs showed visions of society as a conspiracy of aliens  monsters  police states  drug dealers and alternate levels of reality  The linguistics of science fiction merged with the experiments of modernism in a beat generation gestalt  The philosophy of Philip K  Dick would have been impossible without Burroughs   edit  The New Wave See also  New Wave  science fiction  In 1960  British novelist Kingsley Amis published New Maps of Hell  a literary history and examination of the field of science fiction  This serious attention from a mainstream  acceptable writer did a great deal of good  eventually  for the reputation of science fiction  Another major milestone was the publication  in 1965  of Frank Herbert s Dune  a dense  complex  and detailed work of fiction featuring political intrigue in a future galaxy  strange and mystical religious beliefs  and the eco system of the desert planet Arrakis  Another was the emergence of the work of Roger Zelazny  whose novels such as Lord of Light and his famous The Chronicles of Amber showed that the lines between science fiction  fantasy  religion  and social commentary could be very fine  Also in 1965 French director Jean Luc Godard s film Alphaville used the medium of dystopian and apocalyptic science fiction to explore language and society  In Britain  the 1960s generation of writers  dubbed  The New Wave   were experimenting with different forms of science fiction  27  stretching the genre towards surrealism  psychological drama and mainstream currents  The 60s New Wave was centred around the writing in the magazine New Worlds after Michael Moorcock assumed editorial control in 1963  William Burroughs was a big influence  The writers of the New Wave also believed themselves to be building on the legacy of the French New Wave artistic movement  Though the New Wave was largely a British movement  there were parallel developments taking place in American science fiction at the same time  The relation of the British New Wave to American science fiction was made clear by Harlan Ellison s original anthology Dangerous Visions  which presented science fiction writers  both American and British  writing stories that pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable in a science fiction magazine  Isaac Asimov  writing an introduction to the anthology  labeled it the Second Revolution  after the first revolution that produced the Golden Age  The New Wave and their contemporaries placed a greater emphasis on style and a more highbrow form of storytelling  They also sought controversy in subjects older science fiction writers had avoided  For the first time sexuality  which Kingsley Amis had complained was nearly ignored in science fiction  was given serious consideration by writers like Samuel R  Delany  Ursula K  Le Guin  Norman Spinrad  and Theodore Sturgeon  Contemporary political issues were also given voice  as John Brunner and J G  Ballard wrote cautionary tales about  respectively  overpopulation and apocalypse  Asimov noted that the Second Revolution was far less clear cut than the first  attributing this to the development of the anthology  which made older stories more prominent  But a number of Golden Age writers changed their style as the New Wave hit  Robert A  Heinlein switched from his Campbellian Future History stories to stylistically adventuresome  sexually open works of fiction  notably Stranger in a Strange Land and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress  Isaac Asimov wrote the New Wave ish The Gods Themselves  Many others also continued successfully as styles changed  Science fiction films took inspiration from the changes in the genre  Stanley Kubrick s 2001  A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange gave visual form to the genre s new style  A myriad of other films  including THX 1138 and Soylent Green  depicted a dystopian future  Ursula K  Le Guin extrapolated social and biological changes that were anthropological in nature  36 Philip K  Dick explored the metaphysics of the mind in a series of novels and stories that rarely seemed dependent on their science fictional content  LeGuin  Dick  and others like them became associated with the concept of soft science fiction more than with the New Wave  Soft science fiction was contrasted to the notion of hard science fiction  Though scientific plausibility had been a central tenet of the genre since Gernsback  writers like Larry Niven and Poul Anderson gave hard science fiction new life  crafting stories with a more sophisticated writing style and more deeply characterized protagonists  while preserving a high level of scientific sophistication  37   edit  Science fiction in the 1980s  edit  Cyberpunk Main article  Cyberpunk By the early 1980s  the New Wave had faded out as an important presence in the science fiction landscape  As new personal computing technologies became an integral part of society  science fiction writers felt the urge to make statements about its influence on the cultural and political landscape  Drawing on the work of the New Wave  the Cyberpunk movement developed in the early 80s  Though it placed the same influence on style that the New Wave did  it developed its own unique style  typically focusing on the  punks  of their imagined future underworld  Cyberpunk authors like William Gibson turned away from the traditional optimism and support for progress of traditional science fiction  38  William Gibson s Neuromancer  published in 1984  announced the cyberpunk movement to the larger literary world and was a tremendous commercial success  Other key writers in the movement included Bruce Sterling  John Shirley  and later Neal Stephenson  Though Cyberpunk would later be cross pollinated with other styles of science fiction  there seemed to be some notion of ideological purity in the beginning  John Shirley compared the Cyberpunk movement to a tribe  39  During the 1980s  a large number of cyberpunk manga and anime works were produced in Japan  the most notable being the 1982 manga Akira and its 1988 anime film adaptation  the 1985 anime Megazone 23  and the 1989 manga Ghost in the Shell which was also adapted into an anime film in 1995   edit  Contemporary science fiction and its future See also  Postcyberpunk Contemporary science fiction has been marked by the spread of cyberpunk to other parts of the marketplace of ideas  No longer is cyberpunk a ghettoized tribe within science fiction  but an integral part of the field whose interactions with other parts have been the primary theme of science fiction at the turn of the century  Notably  cyberpunk has influenced film  in works such as Johnny Mnemonic and The Matrix series  in anime such as Akira and Ghost in the Shell  and the emerging medium of video games  with the critically acclaimed Deus Ex and Metal Gear series  This entrance of cyberpunk into mainstream culture has led to the introduction of cyberpunk s stylistic motifs to the masses  particularly the cyberpunk fashion style  Emerging themes in the 1990s included environmental issues  the implications of the global Internet and the expanding information universe  questions about biotechnology and nanotechnology  as well as a post Cold War interest in post scarcity societies  Neal Stephenson s The Diamond Age comprehensively explores these themes  Lois McMaster Bujold s Vorkosigan novels brought the character driven story back into prominence  40  The cyberpunk reliance on near future science fiction has deepened  In William Gibson s 2003 novel  Pattern Recognition  the story is a cyberpunk story told in the present  the ultimate limit of the near future extrapolation  Cyberpunk s ideas have spread in other directions  though  Space opera writers have written work featuring cyberpunk motifs  including David Brin s Kiln People and Ken MacLeod s Fall Revolution series  This merging of the two disparate threads of science fiction in the 1980s has produced an extrapolational literature in contrast to those technological stories told in the present  John Clute writes that science fiction at the turn of the century can be understood in two ways   a vision of the triumph of science fiction as a genre and as a series of outstanding texts which figured to our gaze the significant futures that  during those years  came to pass      or     indecipherable from the world during those years     fatally indistinguishable from the world it attempted to adumbrate  to signify    edit  See also Speculative fiction  section History  section Emergent distinction from Science Fiction and pre existing genre schema  Science fiction film
