References 9 Bibliography 10 External links  edit  Humans The practice of castration has its roots before recorded human history  1  Castration was frequently used for religious or social reasons in certain cultures in Europe  the Middle East  South Asia  Africa  and East Asia  After battles in some cases  winners castrated their captives or the corpses of the defeated to symbolize their victory and  seize  their power  Castrated men   eunuchs   were often admitted to special social classes and were used particularly to staff bureaucracies and palace households  in particular  the harem  Castration also figured in a number of religious castration cults  Other religions  for example Judaism  were strongly opposed to the practice  The Leviticus Holiness code  for example  specifically excludes eunuchs or any males with defective genitals from the priesthood  just as castrated animals are excluded from sacrifice  Eunuchs in China had been known to usurp power in many eras of Chinese history  most notably in the Later Han  late Tang and late Ming Dynasty  There are similar recorded Middle Eastern events  In ancient times  castration often involved the total removal of all the male genitalia  This involved great danger of death due to bleeding or infection and  in some states  such as the Byzantine Empire  was seen as the same as a death sentence  Removal of only the testicles had much less risk  Either surgical removal of both testicles or chemical castration may be carried out in the case of prostate cancer  2 Testosterone depletion treatment  either surgical removal of both testicles or chemical castration  is used to slow down the cancer  greatly reduce sex drive or interest in those with sexual drives  obsessions  or behaviors  or any combination of those that may be considered deviant  Castration in humans has been proposed  and sometimes used  as a method of birth control in certain poorer regions  Male to female transsexuals often undergo orchiectomy  as do some other transgender people  Orchiectomy may be performed as part of a more general sex reassignment surgery  either before or during other procedures  It may also be performed on someone who does not desire  or cannot afford  further surgery   edit  Punishment Involuntary castration appears in the history of warfare  sometimes used by one side to torture or demoralize their enemies  It was practiced to extinguish opposing male lineages and thus allow the victor to sexually possess the defeated group s women  Edward Gibbon s famous work Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire reports castration of defeated foes at the hands of the Normans during their invasions of Sicily and Italy  Castration has been used in modern conflicts  such as the Janjaweed militiamen currently  as of 2005 update   attacking citizens of the Darfur region in Sudan  often castrating villagers and leaving them to bleed to death  3  According to legend  during the reign of the legendary Emperor Shun and Yu in China  in 2281 BC castration was passed into law as a punishment  which remained so until the reign of Gaozu  589 600 AD   However  it was still practiced after his reign  4  According to historians  it was incorporated into Chinese law during the Zhou Dynasty  5  It was one of the five physical punishments that could be legally inflicted on criminals in China  6  Records of castrations in China date to the Shang dynasty  when the Shang Kings castrated prisoners of war  7  8  During the reign of King Mu of Zhou the Minister of Crime  Marquis Lu  reformed the law in 950 BC to make it easier for people to be sentenced to castration instead of death  9  In China  castration included penis removal as well as removal of the testicles  Both organs were cut off with a knife at the same time  10  In Han dynasty China castration continued to be used as a punishment for various offences  11  12 Sima Qian  the famous Chinese historian  was castrated by order of the Han Emperor of China for dissent  13  In another incident multiple people  including a chief scribe and his underlings  were subjected to castration  14  Another famous victim of castration was the medieval French philosopher  scholar  teacher  and  later  monk Pierre Ab lard  He was castrated by relatives of his lover  H lo se  Bishop Wimund  a 12th century English adventurer and invader of the Scottish coast  was castrated  William Wallace  the Scottish resistance leader  was castrated as part of his execution  for resistance to English rule  Some legends say that Genghis Khan was castrated by a Tangut princess using a knife  who wanted revenge against his treatment of the Tanguts and to stop him from raping her  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  When the Chinese overthrew Mongol rule and established the Ming dynasty  many Mongols were castrated and turned into eunuchs  22  During the Miao Rebellions  Ming Dynasty   Chinese commanders castrated thousands of Miao boys when their tribes revolted  and then distributed them as eunuch slaves as gifts to various officials  23  In 1778  Thomas Jefferson wrote a bill in Virginia reducing the punishment for rape  polygamy or sodomy from death to castration  24  Aqa Mohammad Khan Qajar  who established the Qajar Dynasty in Iran  in 18th century   was a victim of castration by officers of the previous kingdom  When he conquered Lotf Ali Khan  the last king of the Zand Dynasty  Qajar had Khan castrated in revenge  The sons and grandsons of the rebel Yaqub Beg in China were all castrated  Surviving members of Yaqub Beg s family included his 4 sons  4 grandchildren  2 grandsons and 2 granddaughters   and 4 wives  They either died in prison in Lanzhou  Gansu  or were killed by the Chinese  His sons Yima Kuli  K ati Kuli  Maiti Kuli  and grandson Aisan Ahung were the only survivors in 1879  They were all underage children  and put on trial  sentenced to an agonizing death if they were complicit in their father s rebellious  sedition   or if they were innocent of their fathers crimes  were to be sentenced to castration and serving as a eunuch slave to Chinese troops  when they reached 11 years old  and handed over to the Imperial Household to be executed or castrated  25  26  27  In 1879  it was confirmed that the sentence of castration was carried out  Yaqub Beg s son and grandsons were castrated by the Chinese court in 1879 and turned into eunuchs to work in the Imperial Palace  28  The British officer John Masters recorded in his autobiography that Pathan women in the North West Frontier Province  1901 1955  of British India during the Anglo Afghan Wars would castrate non Muslim soldiers who were captured  like British and Sikhs  29  30  Wim Deetman has been criticised by the Dutch parliament for failing to include evidence of castration 31  in his report on sexual abuse by the Roman Catholic church  when children were  punished  by castration in the 1950 s for reporting sexual abuse by Roman Catholic priests   edit  Slave trade Early on in Korea  castration consisted of daubing a boy s genitals with human feces and having a dog bite them off  32  During the Yuan Dynasty  eunuchs became a desirable commodity for tributes  and dog bites were replaced by more sophisticated surgical techniques  33   edit  Preventive measure  Voluntary  chemical or surgical castration has been in practice in many countries reports are available from American and European countries in particular for over eighty years  chemical for circa thirty  as an option for treatment for people who have broken laws of a sexual nature  allowing them to return to the community from otherwise lengthy detentions  citation needed  The effectiveness and ethics of this treatment are heavily debated  A temporary chemical castration has been studied and developed as a preventive measure and punishment for several repeated sex crimes  such as rape or other sexually related violence  34  35  Physical castration appears to be highly effective as  historically  it results in a 20 year re offense rate of less than 2 3  vs  80  in the untreated control group  according to a large 1963 study involving a total of 1036 sex offenders by the German researcher A  Langel ddeke  among others 36  much lower than what was otherwise expected  Compare to overall sex offender recidivism rates  In modern times  the Czech Republic practices surgically castrating convicted sex offenders  According to the reports compiled by Council of Europe  a human rights forum  the central European country physically castrated at least 94 prisoners in the 10 years up to April 2008  The Czech Republic defends this procedure as voluntary and effective  37  According to Dr  Martin Holl   director of the Psychiatric Hospital Bohnice in Prague  none of the nearly 100 sex offenders who had been physically castrated had committed further offenses  38  One serial offender stated that being castrated was the  best decision  he ever made   On the one hand you have to protect the potential victims and on the other hand I wanted to be protected from myself  I wanted to live like a normal person   39  Don Grubin  a professor at Newcastle University s Institute of Neuroscience who also runs a chemical castration program backed by the U K  s Ministry of Justice  was initially opposed to physical castration  After visiting the Czech Republic  however  he agreed that some form of castration might be of benefit to some sex offenders  39  40   edit  Trafficking of boys for prostitution An article in the Gulf Times revealed a major sex trade in mostly Nepalese boys who were lured to India and sold to brothels in Mumbai  Hyderabad  New Delhi  Lucknow and Gorakhpur  One victim was lured from Nepal at the age of 14  sold into slavery  locked up  beaten  starved  and forcibly circumcised  He reported that he was held in a brothel with 40 to 50 other boys  many of whom were castrated  He escaped and made his way back to Nepal  Two Non Government Organisations  one that works with homosexuals in Nepal  and one that works to rescue and rehabilitate trafficked women and children  were co operating to help and rescue these boys  41   edit  Sexual fetish Castration play is one of many fetishes within the BDSM community  although it is not a mainstream activity  In castration play  one simulates the after effects of castration without actually performing castration  It leads to the removal or destruction of the testicles as a sexual fantasy in some cases   edit  Music In Europe  when women were not permitted to sing in church or cathedral choirs in the Roman Catholic Church  boys might be castrated to prevent their voices breaking at puberty and to develop a special high voice  The first documents mentioning castrati are Italian church records from the 1550s  42  In the baroque and classical music eras these singers were highly appreciated by opera composers as well  Mozart s Exultate Jubilate  Allegri s Miserere and other famous pieces from this period now sung by sopranos and countertenors were written for castrati  Some of the alto parts of Handel s Messiah were first sung by a castrato  Famous castrati include Farinelli  Senesino  Carestini  and Caffarelli  Joseph Haydn was almost castrated  The last castrato was Alessandro Moreschi  1858 1922  who served in the Sistine Chapel Choir  43  In the late 19th century  the Roman Catholic Church  which had always considered castration to be mutilation of the body and therefore a severe sin  officially condemned the production of castrati   edit  Religion A number of religious cults have included castration as a central theme of their practice  These include  The cult of Cybele  in which devotees castrated themselves in ecstatic emulation of Attis  see Gallus  By the end of the third century  many male followers of Early Christianity considered castration as an acceptable way to counter sinful desires of the flesh  Origen is reported by Eusebius 44  to have castrated himself based on his reading of the Gospel of Matthew 19 12 and other passages in Matthew and Mark that appear to endorse voluntary amputation to avoid sin  although there is some doubt concerning this story  Schaff considers the account genuine but cites Baur et al  in opposition  45  Origen argues against such literal interpretations of the passages from Matthew and Mark in his First Principles  Notwithstanding  the first canon of the First Council of Nicea in 325 AD suspended clergy members who practiced voluntary castration  No mention  however  is made in this canon law concerning laity  Ongoing failure to acknowledge this vital distinction still seems to fuel debate within Church circles  Bishop Melito of Sardis  d  ca 180  was a eunuch  according to the church history of Eusebius of Caesarea  though  significantly the word  virgin  was substituted in Rufino s Latin translation of Eusebius  Boston Corbett was inspired by this same verse 19 12 to castrate himself  Corbett was the 19th century American soldier who is generally believed to have fired the shot that killed John Wilkes Booth   Skoptsy Heaven s Gate While Deuteronomy 23 1 expels castrated men from the assembly of Israel  Isaiah 56 3 gives a much more accepting view of eunuchs  and in Acts 8 34 8 39  a eunuch is baptized  Orthodox Judaism 46  forbid the castration of either humans or animals  In ancient Judaism  castrated animals were deemed unfit for sacrifice in the Temple  Lev 22 24   Castrated members of the priestly caste were forbidden to enter certain parts of the temple  to approach the altar  or to make sacrifices  although they could eat their share of the offerings  Lev  21 16 24   Islam also forbid the castration of either humans or animals  Harming  hurting  or torturing human and animal is discouraged in Islam  however the practice derived from older tradition can be found in Islamic society  For example the Ottoman Empire slaves were castrated to be employed as guardians in harems   edit  Medical consequences A subject of castration who is altered before the onset of puberty will retain a high voice  non muscular build  and small genitals  He may well be taller than average  as the production of sex hormones in puberty more specifically  estrogen via aromatization of testosterone stops long bone growth  The person may not develop pubic hair and will have a small sex drive or none at all  Castrations after the onset of puberty will typically reduce the sex drive considerably or eliminate it altogether  Castrated people are automatically sterile  because the testes  for males  and ovaries  for females  produce sex cells needed for sexual reproduction  Once removed the subject is infertile  The voice does not change  Some castrates report mood changes  such as depression or a more serene outlook on life  although this might not be to chemical changes but instead emotional changes due to the implications of the procedure  Body strength and muscle mass can decrease somewhat  Body hair sometimes may decrease  Castration prevents male pattern baldness if it is done before hair is lost  However  castration will not restore hair growth after hair has already been lost due to male pattern baldness  47  Historically  eunuchs who additionally underwent a penectomy reportedly suffered from urinary incontinence associated with the removal of the penis  48  Without hormone replacement therapy  HRT   typical symptoms  similar to those experienced by menopausal women  include hot flashes  gradual bone density loss resulting in osteopenia or osteoporosis  and potential weight gain or redistribution of body fat to the hips chest  Replacement of testosterone in the form of gel  patches  or injections can largely reverse these effects  although breast enlargement has also been reported as a possible side effect of testosterone usage  49   edit  Psychoanalysis and literary theory The concept of castration plays an important role in psychoanalysis  see  for example  castration anxiety  Castration  as a metaphor  also plays an important role in psychoanalytically influenced literary theory  for example Harold Bloom s The Anxiety of Influence   edit  Chemical castration Main article  Chemical castration In the case of chemical castration  ongoing regular injections of anti androgens are required  Chemical castration seems to have a greater effect on bone density than physical castration citation needed   Since the development of teriparatide  this severe bone loss has been able to be reversed in nearly every case citation needed   At this time there is a limitation on the use of this medication to 24 months until the long term use is better evaluated citation needed   With the advent of chemical castration  physical castration is not generally recommended by the medical community unless medically necessary or desired  citation needed  though some have undergone the procedure voluntarily  50   edit  Veterinary practice Castration is commonly performed on domestic animals not intended for breeding  Domestic animals are usually castrated to avoid unwanted or uncontrolled reproduction  to reduce or prevent other manifestations of sexual behaviour such as territorial behaviour or aggression  e g  fighting between groups of entire  uncastrated  males of a species   or to reduce other consequences of sexual behaviour that may make animal husbandry more difficult  such as boundary fence enclosure destruction when attempting to get to nearby females of the species  Male horses are usually castrated  gelded  using emasculators  because stallions are rather aggressive and troublesome  The same applies to male mules  although they are sterile  Male cattle are castrated to improve fattening and docility in feedlots or for use as oxen  Breeding individuals are kept entire and used for breeding  they may fetch higher prices when sold  Livestock may be castrated when used for food to increase growth or weight or both of individual male animals citation needed  and because of the undesirable taste and odor of the meat from sexually mature males  In domestic pigs the taint  called boar taint  is caused by androstenone and skatole concentrations stored in the fat tissues of the animal after sexual maturity  51  Boar taint is only found in a small minority of pigs and can be controlled through breeding selection  diet and management  52  It is released when the fat is heated and has a distinct odor and flavor that is widely considered unpalatable to consumers  53  Consequently  in commercial meat production  male pigs are either castrated shortly after birth or slaughtered before they reach sexual maturity  53  Recent research in Brazil has shown that castration of pigs is unnecessary because most pigs do not have the  boar taint   This is due to many breeds of pigs simply not having the heredity for the boar taint and the fact that pigs are normally slaughtered at a young market weight  54  In the case of pets  castration is usually called neutering  and is encouraged to prevent overpopulation of the community by unwanted animals  and to reduce certain diseases such as prostate disease and testicular cancer in male dogs  oophorectomy in female pets is often called spaying   Testicular cancer is rare in dogs  but prostate problems are somewhat common in unaltered male dogs when they get older  citation needed  Neutered individuals have a much lower risk of developing prostate problems in comparison  citation needed  Unaltered male cats are more likely to develop an obstruction in their urethra  preventing them from urinating to some degree citation needed   however  neutering does not seem to make much difference statistically because many neutered toms also have the problem  citation needed  A specialized vocabulary has arisen for neutered animals of given species  Barrow  pig  Bullock  cattle  Capon  chicken  Gelding  horse  Gib  cat  ferret  Ox  cattle  Stag  cattle  sheep  Steer  cattle  Wether  sheep  goat  An incompletely castrated male in livestock species  horse and cattle  is known as a rig  The term stag is used for a male animal castrated after the secondary sex characteristics have developed to such a point as to give it the appearance of sexual maturity  Methods of veterinary castration include instant surgical removal  the use of an elastrator tool to secure a band around the testicles that disrupts the blood supply  the use of a Burdizzo tool or emasculators to crush the spermatic cords and disrupt the blood supply  pharmacological injections and implants and immunological techniques to inoculate the animal against its own sexual hormones  Certain animals  like horses and swine  are usually surgically treated with a scrotal castration  which can be done with the animal standing while sedated and after local anaesthetic has been applied   while others  like dogs and cats  are anaesthetised and recumbent when surgically castrated with a pre scrotal incision in the case of dogs  or a pre scrotal or scrotal incision used for cats  In veterinary practice an  open  castration refers to a castration in which the inguinal tunic is incised and not sutured  A  closed  castration refers to when the procedure is performed so that the inguinal tunic is sutured together after incision   edit  Parasitic infection Main article  Parasitic castration Some parasitic nematodes chemically castrate their hosts  For example  Microphallus pseudopygmaeus chemically castrates its host  the snail Onoba aculeus  and causes it to grow larger than normal   edit  See also Ashley Treatment Birth control Castration anxiety Castrato  a castrated male singer
