is the holder of a public office created by the United States Constitution  1  The Vice President  together with the President of the United States  is indirectly elected by the people through the Electoral College to a four year term of office  2  The Vice President is the first person in the presidential line of succession  and would ascend to the Presidency upon the death  resignation  or removal of the President  3  Under the Constitution  the Vice President is President of the United States Senate  4  In that capacity  he is allowed to vote in the Senate when necessary to break a tie  While Senate customs have created supermajority rules that have diminished this Constitutional power  the Vice President still retains the ability to influence legislation  e g  the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005   4  5  6  Pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment  the Vice President presides over the joint session of Congress when it convenes to count the vote of the Electoral College  2  While the Vice President s only constitutionally prescribed functions aside from Presidential succession relate to his role as President of the Senate  the office is commonly viewed as a component of the executive branch of the federal government  The United States Constitution does not expressly assign the office to any one branch  causing a dispute amongst scholars whether it belongs to the executive branch  the legislative branch  or both  7  8  9  10  The modern view of the Vice President as a member of the executive branch is due in part to the assignment of executive duties to the Vice President by either the President or Congress  though such activities are only recent historical developments  7  9  Contents 1 Origin 2 Roles of the Vice President 2 1 President of the United States Senate 2 1 1

Delegates to the Philadelphia Convention gave each state a number of presidential electors equal to that state s combined share of House and Senate seats  Yet the delegates were worried that each elector would only favor his own state s favorite son candidate  resulting in deadlocked elections that would produce no winners  To counter this presumed difficulty  the delegates gave each presidential elector two votes  required at least one of those votes be for a candidate from outside the elector s state  and mandated that the winner of the election obtain an absolute majority with respect to the total number of electors  With these rules in place  the delegates hoped each electors  second vote would go to a statesman of national character  11  However  fearing electors might throw away their second vote to bolster their favorite son s chance of winning  the Philadelphia delegates specified that the runner up in the election would become Vice President  Creating this new office imposed a political cost on discarded votes  and thus required electors staidly cast their second ballots  11   edit  Roles of the Vice President The Constitution limits the formal powers and role of Vice President to becoming President should the President become unable to serve  due to the death  resignation  or medical impairment of the President   prompting the well known expression  only a heartbeat away from the Presidency   and to acting as the presiding officer of the U S  Senate   edit  President of the United States Senate As President of the Senate  the Vice President has two primary duties  to cast a vote in the event of a Senate deadlock and to preside over and certify the official vote count of the U S  Electoral College  For example  in the first half of 2001  the Senators were divided 50 50 between Republicans and Democrats and Dick Cheney s tie breaking vote gave the Republicans the Senate majority   edit  Regular duties As President of the Senate  Article I  Section 3  Clause 4   the Vice President oversees procedural matters and may cast a tie breaking vote  There is a strong convention within the U S  Senate that the Vice President not use his position as President of the Senate to influence the passage of legislation or act in a partisan manner  except in the case of breaking tie votes  As President of the Senate  John Adams cast twenty nine tie breaking votes  a record that no successor except for John C  Calhoun even threatened  Adams s votes protected the President s sole authority over the removal of appointees  influenced the location of the national capital  and prevented war with Great Britain  On at least one occasion Adams persuaded senators to vote against legislation that he opposed  and he frequently addressed the Senate on procedural and policy matters  Adams s political views and his active role in the Senate made him a natural target for critics of George Washington s administration  Toward the end of his first term  as a result of a threatened resolution that would have silenced him except for procedural and policy matters  he began to exercise more restraint in the hope of realizing the goal shared by many of his successors  election in his own right as President of the United States  In modern times  the Vice President rarely presides over day to day matters in the Senate  in his place  the Senate chooses a President pro tempore  or  president for a time   to preside in the Vice President s absence  the Senate normally selects the longest serving senator in the majority party  The President pro tempore has the power to appoint any other senator to preside and in practice  junior senators from the majority party are assigned the task of presiding over the Senate at most times  Except for this tie breaking role  the Standing Rules of the Senate vest no significant responsibilities in the Vice President  Rule XIX  which governs debate  does not authorize the Vice President to participate in debate  and grants only to members of the Senate  and  upon appropriate notice  former presidents of the United States  the privilege of addressing the Senate  without granting a similar privilege to the sitting Vice President  Thus  as Time magazine wrote during the controversial tenure of Vice President Charles G  Dawes   once in four years the Vice President can make a little speech  and then he is done  For four years he then has to sit in the seat of the silent  attending to speeches ponderous or otherwise  of deliberation or humor   12   edit  Recurring  infrequent duties The President of the Senate also presides over counting and presentation of the votes of the Electoral College  This process occurs in the presence of both houses of Congress  generally on January 6 of the year following a U S  presidential election  13  In this capacity  only four Vice Presidents have been able to announce their own election to the presidency  John Adams  Thomas Jefferson  Martin Van Buren  and George H  W  Bush  At the beginning of 1961  it fell to Richard Nixon to preside over this process  which officially announced the election of his 1960 opponent  John F  Kennedy  In 2001  Al Gore announced the election of his opponent  George W  Bush  In 1969  Vice President Hubert H  Humphrey would have announced the election of his opponent  Richard Nixon  however  on the date of the Congressional joint session  January 6   Humphrey was in Norway attending the funeral of Trygve Lie  the first elected Secretary General of the United Nations  14  In 1933  incumbent Vice President Charles Curtis announced the election of House Speaker John Nance Garner as his successor  while Garner was seated next to him on the House dais  The President of the Senate may also preside over most of the impeachment trials of federal officers  However  whenever the President is impeached  the US Constitution requires the Chief Justice of the United States to preside over the Senate for the trial  The Constitution is silent as to the presiding officer in the instance where the Vice President is the officer impeached   edit  Succession and the Twenty Fifth Amendment John Tyler was the first Vice President to assume the Presidency following the death of his predecessor  In doing so  he insisted that he was the President  not merely an acting President  The U S  Constitution provides that should the president die or become disabled while in office  the  powers and duties  of the office are transferred to the Vice President  Initially  it was unclear whether the Vice President actually became the new President or merely an acting President  This was first tested in 1841 with the death of President William Henry Harrison  Harrison s Vice President  John Tyler  asserted that he had succeeded to the full Presidential office  powers  and title  and declined to acknowledge documents referring to him as  Acting President   Despite some strong calls against it  Tyler took the oath of office as the tenth President  Tyler s claim was not challenged legally  and so the Tyler precedent of full succession was established  This was made explicit by Section 1 of the Twenty fifth Amendment to the U S  Constitution  ratified in 1967  Section 2 of the Twenty fifth Amendment provides for Vice Presidential succession  Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President  the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress  Gerald Ford was the first Vice President selected by this method  after the resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew in 1973  after succeeding to the Presidency  Ford nominated Nelson Rockefeller as Vice President  President Lyndon Johnson is sworn in following the assassination of President John Kennedy  Another issue was who had the power to declare that an incapacitated president is unable to discharge his duties  This question had arisen most recently with the illnesses of President Dwight D  Eisenhower  Section 3 and Section 4 of the amendment provide means for the Vice President to become Acting President upon the temporary disability of the president  Section 3 deals with self declared incapacity of the president  Section 4 deals with incapacity declared by the joint action of the Vice President and of a majority of the Cabinet  While Section 4 has never been invoked  Section 3 has been invoked three times  on July 13  1985 when Ronald Reagan underwent surgery to remove cancerous polyps from his colon  and twice more on June 29  2002 and July 21  2007 when George W  Bush underwent colonoscopy procedures requiring sedation  Prior to this amendment  Vice President Richard Nixon informally replaced President Dwight Eisenhower for several weeks on each of three occasions when Eisenhower was ill   edit  Informal roles The extent of any informal roles and functions of the Vice President depend on the specific relationship between the President and the Vice President  but often include tasks such as drafter and spokesperson for the administration s policies  adviser to the President  and being a symbol of American concern or support  The influence of the Vice President in this role depends almost entirely on the characteristics of the particular administration  Dick Cheney  for instance  was widely regarded as one of President George W  Bush s closest confidants  Al Gore was an important adviser to President Bill Clinton on matters of foreign policy and the environment  Often  Vice Presidents will take harder line stands on issues to ensure the support of the party s base while deflecting partisan criticism away from the President  citation needed  Under the American system the President is both head of state and head of government  and the ceremonial duties of the former position are often delegated to the Vice President  The Vice President may meet with other heads of state or attend state funerals in other countries  at times when the administration wishes to demonstrate concern or support but cannot send the President himself  Not all Vice Presidents are happy in their jobs  John Nance Garner  who served as Vice President from 1933 to 1941 under President Franklin D  Roosevelt  claimed that the Vice Presidency  isn t worth a pitcher of warm piss   15  Other statutorily granted roles include membership of both the National Security Council and the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution   edit  Office as stepping stone to the Presidency In recent decades  the Vice Presidency has frequently been used to launch bids for the Presidency  The transition of the office to its modern stature occurred primarily as a result of Franklin Roosevelt s 1940 nomination  when he captured the ability to nominate his running mate instead of leaving the nomination to the convention  Prior to that  party bosses often used the Vice Presidential nomination as a consolation prize for the party s minority faction  A further factor potentially contributing to the rise in prestige of the office was the adoption of Presidential preference primaries in the early 20th century  By adopting primary voting  the field of candidates for Vice President was expanded by both the increased quantity and quality of presidential candidates successful in some primaries  yet who ultimately failed to capture the Presidential nomination at the convention  Of the thirteen Presidential elections from 1956 to 2004  nine featured the incumbent President  the other four  1960  1968  1988  2000  all featured the incumbent Vice President  Former Vice Presidents also ran  in 1984  Walter Mondale   and in 1968  Richard Nixon  against the incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey   The first Presidential election to include neither the incumbent President nor the incumbent Vice President on a major party ticket since 1952 came in 2008 when President George W  Bush had already served two terms and Vice President Cheney chose not to run  Richard Nixon is also the only non sitting Vice President to be elected President  as well as the only person to be elected President and Vice President twice each   edit  Selection process  edit  Eligibility John Adams  the first Vice President of the United States The Twelfth Amendment states that  no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice President of the United States   16  Thus  to serve as Vice President  an individual must  Be a natural born U S  citizen  Be at least 35 years old Have resided in the U S  at least 14 years  17   edit  Disqualifications Additionally  Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment denies eligibility for any federal office to anyone who  having sworn an oath to support the United States Constitution  later has rebelled against the United States  This disqualification  originally aimed at former supporters of the Confederacy  may be removed by a two thirds vote of each house of the Congress  Under the Twenty second Amendment  the President of the United States may not be elected to more than two terms  However  there is no similar such limitation as to how many times one can be elected Vice President  Scholars disagree whether a former President barred from election to the Presidency is also ineligible to be elected Vice President  as suggested by the Twelfth Amendment  18  19  The issue has never been tested in practice  Also  Article I  Section 3  Clause 7 allows the Senate  upon voting to remove an impeached federal official from office  to disqualify that official from holding any federal office   edit  Residency limitation While it is commonly held that the President and Vice President must be residents of different states  this is not actually the case  Nothing in the Constitution prohibits both candidates being from a single state  Instead  the limitation imposed is on the members of the Electoral College  who must cast a ballot for at least one candidate who is not from their own state  In theory  the candidates elected could both be from one state  but the electors of that state would run the risk of denying their vice presidential candidate the absolute majority required to secure the election  even if the presidential candidate is elected  This would then place the vice presidential election in the hands of the Senate  In practice  however  residency is rarely an issue  Parties have avoided nominating tickets containing two candidates from the same state  Further  the candidates may themselves take action to alleviate any residency conflict  For example  at the start of the 2000 election cycle Dick Cheney was a resident of Texas  where he was the CEO of Halliburton  Cheney quickly changed his residency back to Wyoming  where he had previously served as a U S  Representative  when Texas governor and Republican presidential nominee George W  Bush asked Cheney to be his vice presidential candidate   edit  Nominating process The vice presidential candidates of the major national political parties are formally selected by each party s quadrennial nominating convention  following the selection of the party s presidential candidates  The official process is identical to the one by which the presidential candidates are chosen  with delegates placing the names of candidates into nomination  followed by a ballot in which candidates must receive a majority to secure the party s nomination  In practice  the presidential nominee has considerable influence on the decision  and in the 20th century it became customary for that person to select a preferred running mate  who is then nominated and accepted by the convention  In recent years  with the presidential nomination usually being a foregone conclusion as the result of the primary process  the selection of a vice presidential candidate is often announced prior to the actual balloting for the presidential candidate  and sometimes before the beginning of the convention itself  The first presidential aspirant to announce his selection for Vice President before the beginning of the convention was Ronald Reagan who  prior to the 1976 Republican National Convention announced that Richard Schweiker would be his running mate  Reagan s supporters then sought to amend the convention rules so that Gerald R  Ford would be required to name his vice presidential running mate in advance as well  The proposal was defeated  and Reagan did not receive the nomination in 1976  Often  the presidential nominee will name a vice presidential candidate who will bring geographic or ideological balance to the ticket or appeal to a particular constituency  The vice presidential candidate might also be chosen on the basis of traits the presidential candidate is perceived to lack  or on the basis of name recognition  To foster party unity  popular runners up in the presidential nomination process are commonly considered  The ultimate goal of vice presidential candidate selection is to help and not hurt the party s chances of getting elected  An overly dynamic selection can backfire by outshining the presidential candidate  Classic examples of this came in 1988  when Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis chose experienced Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen  and 2008  when Republican candidate John McCain picked Alaska Governor Sarah Palin  However  Palin also hurt McCain in that after interviews with Katie Couric  there were concerns about her becoming a political liability amid doubts about her fitness to become President should McCain be disabled or die  20  In these and in other cases the selection was seen to have hurt the nominee  In 1984  Walter Mondale picked Geraldine Ferraro whose nomination became a drag on the ticket due to repeated questions about her husband s finances  Questions about Dan Quayle s experience and temperament did not help the 1988 presidential campaign of George H W  Bush  but he still won  James Stockdale  the choice of third party candidate Ross Perot in 1992  was seen as incompetent by many  but the Perot Stockdale ticket still won about 19  of the vote  The first Presidential candidate to choose his Vice Presidential candidate was President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1940  21  The last not to name a Vice Presidential choice  leaving the matter up to the convention  was Democrat Adlai Stevenson in 1956  The convention chose Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver over Massachusetts Senator  and later president  John F  Kennedy  At the tumultuous 1972 Democratic convention  presidential nominee George McGovern selected Senator Thomas Eagleton as his running mate  but numerous other candidates were either nominated from the floor or received votes during the balloting  Eagleton nevertheless received a majority of the votes and the nomination  though he later resigned from the ticket  resulting in Robert Sargent Shriver becoming McGovern s final running mate  both lost to the Nixon Agnew ticket by a wide margin  carrying only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia  In cases where the presidential nomination is still in doubt as the convention approaches  the campaigns for the two positions may become intertwined  In 1976  Ronald Reagan  who was trailing President Gerald R  Ford in the presidential delegate count  announced prior to the Republican National Convention that  if nominated  he would select Senator Richard Schweiker as his running mate  This move backfired to a degree  as Schweiker s relatively liberal voting record alienated many of the more conservative delegates who were considering a challenge to party delegate selection rules to improve Reagan s chances  citation needed  In the end  Ford narrowly won the presidential nomination and Reagan s selection of Schweiker became moot   edit  Election  oath  and tenure A map of the United States showing the number of electoral votes allocated to each state  270 electoral votes are required for a majority out of 538 overall  Main article  Electoral College  United States  Vice Presidents are elected indirectly in the United States  A number of electors  collectively known as the Electoral College  officially select the President  On Election Day  voters in each of the states and the District of Columbia cast ballots for these electors  Each state is allocated a number of electors  equal to the size of its delegation in both Houses of Congress combined  Generally  the ticket that wins the most votes in a state wins all of that state s electoral votes and thus has its slate of electors chosen to vote in the Electoral College  The winning slate of electors meet at its state s capital on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December  about six weeks after the election  to vote  They then send a record of that vote to Congress  The vote of the electors is opened by the sitting Vice President  acting in his capacity as President of the Senate and read aloud to a joint session of the incoming Congress  which was elected at the same time as the President  Four Vice Presidents  L R  outgoing Pres  Lyndon B  Johnson  the 37th Vice President   incoming Pres  Richard Nixon  36th   Everett Dirksen  Spiro Agnew incoming Vice President  39th   and the outgoing Vice President Hubert Humphrey  38th   January 20  1969 Pursuant to the Twentieth Amendment  the Vice President s term of office begins at noon on January 20 of the year following the election  This date  known as Inauguration Day  marks the beginning of the four year terms of both the President and Vice President  Although Article VI requires that the Vice President take an oath or affirmation of allegiance to the US Constitution  unlike the President  the United States Constitution does not specify the precise wording of the oath of office for the Vice President  Several variants of the oath have been used since 1789  the current form  which is also recited by Senators  Representatives and other government officers  has been used since 1884    I  A  B   do solemnly swear  or affirm  that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies  foreign and domestic  that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same  that I take this obligation freely  without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion  and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter  So help me God  22    The term of office for Vice President is four years  While the Twenty Second Amendment generally restricts the President to two terms  there is no similar limitation on the office of Vice President  meaning an eligible person could hold the office as long as voters continued to vote for electors who in turn would renew the Vice President s tenure  A Vice President could even serve under different administrations  as George Clinton and John C  Calhoun have done   edit  Original election process and reform Under the original terms of the Constitution  the electors of the Electoral College voted only for office of President rather than for both President and Vice President  Each elector was allowed to vote for two people for the top office  The person receiving the greatest number of votes  provided that such a number was a majority of electors  would be President  while the individual who received the next largest number of votes became Vice President  If no one received a majority of votes  then the House of Representatives would choose among the five highest vote getters  with each state getting one vote  In such a case  the person who received the highest number of votes but was not chosen President would become Vice President  In the case of a tie for second  then the Senate would choose the Vice President  23  The original plan  however  did not foresee the development of political parties and their adversarial role in the government  In the election of 1796  for instance  Federalist John Adams came in first  but because the Federalist electors divided their second vote amongst several Vice Presidential candidates  Democratic Republican Thomas Jefferson came second  Thus  the President and Vice President were from opposing parties  Predictably  Adams and Jefferson clashed over issues such as states s rights and foreign policy  24  A greater problem occurred in the election of 1800  in which the two participating parties each had a secondary candidate they intended to elect as Vice President  but the more popular Democratic Republican party failed to execute that plan with their electoral votes  Under the system in place at the time  Article II  Section 1  Clause 3   the electors could not differentiate between their two candidates  so the plan had been for one elector to vote for Thomas Jefferson but not for Aaron Burr  thus putting Burr in second place  This plan broke down for reasons that are disputed  and both candidates received the same number of votes  After 35 deadlocked ballots in the House of Representatives  Jefferson finally won on the 36th ballot and Burr became Vice President  25  This tumultuous affair led to the adoption of the Twelfth Amendment in 1804  which directed the electors to use separate ballots to vote for the President and Vice President  26  While this solved the problem at hand  it ultimately had the effect of lowering the prestige of the Vice Presidency  as the office was no longer for the leading challenger for the Presidency  The separate ballots for President and Vice President became something of a moot issue later in the 19th century when it became the norm for popular elections to determine a state s Electoral College delegation  Electors chosen this way are pledged to vote for a particular presidential and vice presidential candidate  offered by the same political party   So  while the Constitution says that the President and Vice President are chosen separately  in practice they are chosen together  If no vice presidential candidate receives an Electoral College majority  then the Senate selects the Vice President  in accordance with the United States Constitution  This could in theory lead to a situation in which the incumbent Vice President   in his role as President of the Senate   would be called upon to give his tie breaking vote for himself or his successor  The election of 1836 is the only election so far where the office of the Vice President has been decided by the Senate  During the campaign  Martin Van Buren s running mate Richard Mentor Johnson was accused of having lived with a black woman  Virginia s 23 electors  who were pledged to Van Buren and Johnson  refused to vote for Johnson  but still voted for Van Buren   The election went to the Senate  where Johnson was elected 33 17   edit  Salary The Vice President s salary is  230 700  27  The salary was set by the 1989 Government Salary Reform Act  which also provides an automatic cost of living adjustment for federal employees  The Vice President does not automatically receive a pension based on that office  but instead receives the same pension as other members of Congress based on his position as president of the Senate  28  The Vice President must serve a minimum of five years to qualify for a pension  29  Since 1974  the official residence of the Vice President and his family has been Number One Observatory Circle  on the grounds of the United States Naval Observatory in Washington  D C   edit  Vacancy John C  Calhoun was the first Vice President to resign from office  See also  Impeachment in the United States  Twenty fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution  and List of Vice Presidents of the United States Article I  Section 2  Clause 5 and Article II  Section 4 of the Constitution both authorize the House of Representatives to serve as a  grand jury  with the power to impeach high federal officials  including the President  for  treason  bribery  or other high crimes and misdemeanors   Similarly  Article I  Section 3  Clause 6 and Article II  Section 4 both authorize the Senate to serve as a court with the power to remove impeached officials from office  given a two thirds vote to convict  No Vice President has ever been impeached  least of all convicted  in 1973  Spiro Agnew came the closest  Facing the possibility of impeachment after federal investigators probed his having allegedly received kickbacks from Maryland contractors when he was serving as County Executive of Baltimore County  he instead resigned and pleaded no contest to a single count of income tax evasion  Prior to ratification of the Twenty fifth Amendment in 1967  no provision existed for filling a vacancy in the office of Vice President  As a result  the Vice Presidency was left vacant 16 times  sometimes for nearly four years  until the next ensuing election and inauguration eight times due to the death of the sitting president  resulting in the Vice Presidents becoming President  seven times due to the death of the sitting Vice President  and once due to the resignation of Vice President John C  Calhoun to become a senator  Calhoun resigned because he had been dropped from the ticket by President Andrew Jackson in favor of Martin Van Buren  Already a lame duck Vice President  he was elected to the Senate by the South Carolina state legislature and resigned the Vice Presidency early to begin his Senate term because he believed he would have more power as a senator  Since the adoption of the Twenty Fifth Amendment  the office has been vacant twice while awaiting confirmation of the new Vice President by both houses of Congress  The first such instance occurred in 1973 following the resignation of Spiro Agnew as Richard Nixon s Vice President  Gerald Ford was subsequently nominated by President Nixon and confirmed by Congress  The second occurred 10 months later when Nixon resigned following the Watergate scandal and Ford assumed the Presidency  The resulting Vice Presidential vacancy was filled by Nelson Rockefeller  Ford and Rockefeller are the only two people to have served as Vice President without having been elected to the office  Once the election is over  the Vice President s usefulness is over  He s like the second stage of a rocket  He s damn important going into orbit  but he s always thrown off to burn up in the atmosphere    An aide to Vice President Hubert Humphrey  30  The Twenty Fifth Amendment also made provisions for a replacement in the event that the Vice President died in office  resigned  or succeeded to the presidency  The original Constitution had no provision for selecting such a replacement  so the office of Vice President would remain vacant until the beginning of the next Presidential and Vice Presidential terms  This issue had arisen most recently with the assassination of then President John Kennedy on November 22  1963  and was rectified by Section 2 of the Twenty Fifth Amendment   edit  Growth of the office For more details on this topic  see Office of the Vice President of the United States    My country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived     John Adams  to his wife Abigail 31  For much of its existence  the office of Vice President was seen as little more than a minor position  Adams  the first Vice President  was the first of many who found the job frustrating and stupefying  31 Thomas R  Marshall  the 28th Vice President  lamented   Once there were two brothers  One ran away to sea  the other was elected Vice President of the United States  And nothing was heard of either of them again   32  His successor  Calvin Coolidge  was so obscure that Major League Baseball sent him free passes that misspelled his name  and a fire marshal failed to recognize him when Coolidge s Washington residence was evacuated  33  When the Whig Party asked Daniel Webster to run for the Vice Presidency on Zachary Taylor s ticket  he replied  I do not propose to be buried until I am really dead and in my coffin   34  This was the second time Webster declined the office  which William Henry Harrison had first offered to him  Ironically  both of the Presidents making the offer to Webster died in office  meaning the three time Presidential candidate could have become President if he had accepted either  Since Presidents rarely died in office  however  the better preparation for the Presidency was considered to be the office of Secretary of State  in which Webster served under Harrison  Tyler  and later  Taylor s successor  Fillmore  Though prominent as a Missouri Senator  Harry Truman had been Vice President only three months when he became President  he was never informed of Franklin Roosevelt s war or postwar policies while Vice President  For many years  the Vice President was given few responsibilities  Garret Hobart  the first Vice President under William McKinley  was one of the very few Vice Presidents at this time who played an important role in the administration  A close confidant and adviser of the President  Hobart was called  Assistant President   35  However  until 1919  Vice Presidents weren t included in meetings of the President s Cabinet  This precedent was broken by President Woodrow Wilson when he asked Thomas R  Marshall to preside over Cabinet meetings while Wilson was in France negotiating the Treaty of Versailles  36  President Warren G  Harding also invited his Vice President  Calvin Coolidge  to meetings  The next Vice President  Charles G  Dawes  did not seek to attend Cabinet meetings under President Coolidge  declaring that  the precedent might prove injurious to the country   37  Vice President Charles Curtis was also precluded from attending by President Herbert Hoover  Vice President Dick Cheney met with Vice President elect Joe Biden at Number One Observatory Circle on November 13  2008  representing a transition between Vice Presidencies  In 1933  Franklin D  Roosevelt raised the stature of the office by renewing the practice of inviting the Vice President to cabinet meetings  which every President since has maintained  Roosevelt s first Vice President  John Nance Garner  broke with him at the start of the second term on the Court packing issue and became Roosevelt s leading political enemy  Garner s successor  Henry Wallace  was given major responsibilities during the war  but he moved further to the left than the Democratic Party and the rest of the Roosevelt administration and was relieved of actual power  Roosevelt kept his last Vice President  Harry Truman  uninformed on all war and postwar issues  such as the atomic bomb  leading Truman to remark  wryly  that the job of the Vice President was to  go to weddings and funerals   Following Roosevelt s death and Truman s ascension to the presidency  the need to keep Vice Presidents informed on national security issues became clear  and Congress made the Vice President one of four statutory members of the National Security Council in 1949  Richard Nixon reinvented the office of Vice President  He had the attention of the media and the Republican party  when Dwight Eisenhower ordered him to preside at Cabinet meetings in his absence  Nixon was also the first Vice President to assume temporary control of the executive branch  which he did after Eisenhower suffered a heart attack on September 24  1955  ileitis in June 1956  and a stroke in November 1957  President Jimmy Carter was the first President to formally give his Vice President  Walter Mondale  an office in the West Wing of the White House  Though Walter Mondale s tenure was the beginning of the modern day power of the Vice Presidency  the tenure of Dick Cheney saw a rapid growth in the office of the Vice President  Vice President Cheney held a tremendous amount of power and frequently made policy decisions on his own  without the knowledge of the President  38  After his tenure  and during the 2008 Presidential campaign  both Vice Presidential candidates  Sarah Palin  and Joe Biden  stated that the office had expanded too much under Cheney s tenure and both had planned to reduce the role to simply being an adviser to the President  39   edit  Post Vice Presidency Six Vice Presidents  the incumbent and five former Vice Presidents  are currently living  Walter Mondale with Jimmy Carter  Born  1928 01 05  5 January 1928  age 84  George H  W  Bush with Ronald Reagan  Born  1924 06 12  12 June 1924  age 87  Dan Quayle with George H  W  Bush  Born  1947 02 04  4 February 1947  age 65  Al Gore with Bill Clinton  Born  1948 03 31  31 March 1948  age 63  Dick Cheney with George W  Bush  Born  1941 01 30  30 January 1941  age 71  Incumbent Joe Biden with Barack Obama  Born  1942 11 20  20 November 1942  age 69  Recently  many former Vice Presidents have pursued very active careers after leaving office  Hubert H  Humphrey was re elected to the Senate in 1970  Walter Mondale ran unsuccessfully for president in 1984  and then sought unsuccessfully to return to the Senate in 2002  George H W  Bush won the presidency  and his Vice President  Dan Quayle  briefly sought the Republican nomination in 2000  Former Vice President Al Gore also ran for the Presidency in 2000  Following his unsuccessful run for the Presidency  Gore became very active in issues relating to the environment  and vigorously fights for the recognition of global warming and climate change  Cheney had previously explored the possibility of running for President before serving as Vice President  but chose not to run for President after his two terms as Vice President  Following his tenure  he has been very critical of the Obama administration  especially its treatment of terror detainees  which was something that Cheney had great authority and experience over throughout his tenure  Former presidents and vice presidents who are elected or re elected to the Senate are entitled to the largely honorific position of Deputy President pro tempore  So far  the only former vice president to have held this title is Hubert H  Humphrey following his return to the Senate  Walter Mondale would have been entitled to the position had his 2002 Senate bid been successful  While former Vice Presidents are eligible for pensions  they are not entitled to Secret Service personal protection  40  However  former Vice Presidents traditionally receive Secret Service protection for up to six months after leaving office  by order of the Secretary of Homeland Security  41  In 2008  a bill titled the  Former Vice President Protection Act  was passed by the House of Representatives  42  It would have provided six month Secret Service protection by law to a former Vice President and family  but was not passed by the Senate  According to the Department of Homeland Security  protection for former Vice President Cheney has been extended numerous times because threats against him have not decreased since his leaving office  43  Former Democratic Vice Presidents are ex officio  superdelegates  to the Democratic National Convention   edit  List of officeholders Main article  List of Vice Presidents of the United States  edit  References   U S  Const
