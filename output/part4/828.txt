fiction  fantasy  horror fiction and related genres  which together constitute speculative fiction  SF   a  Such elements may include a lesbian  gay  bisexual  transsexual  or transgender  LGBT  character as the protagonist or a major character  or exploration of varieties of sexual experience that deviate from the conventional  Science fiction and fantasy have traditionally been puritanical genres aimed at a male readership  and can be more restricted than non genre literature by their conventions of characterisation and the effect that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender  However  speculative fiction also gives authors and readers the freedom to imagine societies that are different from real life cultures  This freedom makes speculative fiction a useful means of examining sexual bias  by forcing the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions  It has also been claimed that LGBT readers identify strongly with the mutants  aliens  and other outsider characters found in speculative fiction by whom   Before the 1960s  explicit sexuality of any kind was rare in speculative fiction  as the editors who controlled what was published attempted to protect their perceived key market of adolescent male readers  As the readership broadened  it became possible to include characters who were undisguised homosexuals  though these tended to be villains  and lesbians remained almost entirely unrepresented  In the 1960s  science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by the civil rights movement and the emergence of a counterculture  New wave and feminist science fiction authors realised cultures in which homosexuality  bisexuality and a variety of gender models were the norm  and in which sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality were commonplace  From the 1980s onwards  homosexuality gained much wider mainstream acceptance  and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional speculative fiction stories  Works emerged that went beyond simple representation of homosexuality to explorations of specific issues relevant to the LGBT community  This development was helped by the growing number of openly gay or lesbian authors and their early acceptance by speculative fiction fandom  Specialist gay publishing presses and a number of awards recognising LGBT achievements in the genre emerged  and by the twenty first century blatant homophobia was no longer considered acceptable by most readers of speculative fiction  There was a concurrent increase in representation of homosexuality within non literary forms of speculative fiction  The inclusion of LGBT themes in comic books  television and film continues to attract media attention and controversy  while the perceived lack of sufficient representation  along with unrealistic depictions  provokes criticism from LGBT sources  Contents 1 Critical analysis 2 Literature 2 1 Proto SF 2 2 The pulp era  1920 30s

mythology  which often features homosexuality  is a source for much modern speculative fiction and mythic figures continue to appear in fantasy stories  1  See also  LGBT themes in horror fiction and LGBT themes in mythology As genres of popular literature  science fiction and fantasy often seem more constrained than non genre literature by their conventions of characterisation and the effects that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender  1  Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre oriented toward a male readership  2  Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror  2  and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives  3  On the other hand  science fiction and fantasy can also provide more freedom than realistic literature to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that permeate many cultures  1  Homosexuality is now an accepted and common feature of science fiction and fantasy literature  its prevalence due to the influence of lesbian feminist and gay liberation movements  4  In speculative fiction  extrapolation allows writers to focus not on the way things are  or were   as non genre literature does  but on the way things could be different  It provides science fiction with a quality that science fiction critic Darko Suvin has called  cognitive estrangement   the recognition that what we are reading is not the world as we know it  but a world whose differences force us to reconsider our own with an outsider s perspective  5  6  When the extrapolation involves sexuality or gender  it can force the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions  the freedom to imagine societies different from real life cultures makes SF an effective tool for examining sexual bias  2  In science fiction  such estranging features include technologies that significantly alter sex or reproduction  In fantasy  such features include figures such as mythological deities and heroic archetypes  who are not limited by preconceptions of human sexuality and gender  allowing them to be reinterpreted  1  SF has also depicted a plethora of alien methods of reproduction and sex  2  some of which can be viewed as homo  or bisexual through a human binary gender lens  In spite of the freedom offered by the genres  gay characters often remain contrived and stereotypical  7  8  and most SF stories take for granted the continuation of heteronormative institutions  9  Alternative sexualities have usually been approached allegorically  or by including LGBT characters in such a way as to not contradict mainstream society s assumptions about gender roles  10  Works that feature gay characters are more likely to be written by women writers  and to be viewed as being aimed at other women or girls  big name male writers are less prone to explore gay themes  11  Speculative fiction has traditionally been  straight   12  Samuel R  Delany has written that the science fiction community is predominantly made up of white male heterosexuals  but that the proportion of minorities  including gay people  is generally higher than found in a  literary  group  13  The inclusion of homosexuality in SF has been described in Science Fiction Culture as  sometimes lagging behind the general population  sometimes surging ahead   14 Nicola Griffith has written that LGBT readers tend to identify strongly with the outsider status of mutants  aliens  and characters who lead hidden or double lives in science fiction  15  In comparison  Geoff Ryman has claimed that the gay and SF genre markets are incompatible  with his books being marketed as one or the other  but never both  16  and David Seed said that SF purists have denied that SF that focuses on soft science fiction themes and marginalised groups  including  gay SF   is  real  science fiction  17  Gay and lesbian science fiction have at times been grouped as distinct subgenres of SF  18  and have some tradition of separate publishers and awards   edit  Literature  edit  Proto SF Illustration by D  H  Friston that accompanied the first publication of lesbian vampire novella Carmilla in The Dark Blue magazine in 1872 True History by the Greek writer Lucian  A D  120 185  has been called the earliest surviving example of science fiction 19  20  and the first ever  gay science fiction story   21  The narrator is suddenly enveloped by a typhoon and swept up to the moon  which is inhabited by a society of men that are at war with the sun  After the hero distinguishes himself in combat  the king gives him his son the prince in marriage  The all male society reproduces  male children only  by giving birth from the thigh or by growing a child from a plant produced by planting the left testicle in the moon s soil  22  In other proto SF works  sex itself  of any type  was equated with base desires or  beastliness   as in Gulliver s Travels  which contrasts the animalistic and overtly sexual Yahoos with the reserved and intelligent Houyhnhnms  2  The frank treatment of sexual topics of pre nineteenth century literature was abandoned in most speculative fiction  2  although Wendy Pearson has written that issues of gender and sexuality have been central to SF since its inception but were ignored by readers and critics until the late twentieth century  23  Early works that contained LGBT themes and showed the gay characters to be morally impure include the first lesbian vampire story  Carmilla   1872  by Sheridan Le Fanu b  24  and The Picture of Dorian Gray  1890  by Oscar Wilde  which shocked contemporary readers with its sensuality and overtly homosexual characters  25  An Anglo American Alliance  a 1906 novel by Gregory Casparian  was the first SF themed novel to openly portray a lesbian romantic relationship  26   edit  The pulp era  1920 30s  Cover of first edition of Odd John  1935  During the pulp era  27  explicit sexuality of any kind was rare in genre science fiction and fantasy  2  For many years  the editors who controlled what was published felt that they had to protect the adolescent male readership that they identified as their principal market  2  Although the covers of some 1930s pulp magazines showed scantily clad women menaced by tentacled aliens  the covers were often more lurid than the magazines  contents  2  In such a context  writers like Edgar Pangborn  who featured passionate male friendships in his work  were exceptional  almost until the end of their careers  including so much as a kiss would have been too much  Implied or disguised sexuality was as important as that which was openly revealed  2  As such  genre SF reflected the social mores of the day  paralleling common prejudices  2  This was particularly true of pulp fiction  more so than literary works of the time  2  As the demographics of the readership broadened  it became possible to include characters who were more or less undisguised homosexuals  but these  in accordance with the attitudes of the times  tended to be villains  evil  demented  or effeminate stereotypes  The most popular role for the homosexual was as a  decadent slaveholding lordling  whose corrupt tyranny was doomed to be overthrown by the young male heterosexual hero  22  During this period  lesbians were almost entirely unrepresented as either heroes or villains  22  One of the earliest examples of genre science fiction that involves a challenging amount of unconventional sexual activity is the early novel Odd John  1935   by Olaf Stapledon  John is a mutant with extraordinary mental abilities who will not allow himself to be bound by many of the rules imposed by the ordinary British society of his time  The novel strongly implies that he seduces an older boy who becomes devoted to him but also suffers from the affront that the relationship creates to his own morals  28   edit  The Golden Age  1940 50s  June 1953 s issue of Universe In the Golden Age of Science Fiction  27  the genre  resolutely ignored the whole subject  of homosexuality  according to Joanna Russ  29  As the readership for science fiction and fantasy began to age in the 1950s  however  writers like Philip Jose Farmer and Theodore Sturgeon were able to introduce more explicit sexuality into their work  Until the late 1960s  however  few other writers depicted alternative sexuality or revised gender roles  or openly investigated sexual questions  2  14  The majority of LGBT characters were depicted as caricatures  such as  man hating amazons   and attempts at portraying homosexuals sympathetically or non stereotypically were met with hostility  30  Sturgeon wrote many stories during the Golden Age of Science Fiction that emphasised the importance of love  regardless of the current social norms  In his short story  The World Well Lost   1953   c  first published in Universe magazine  homosexual alien fugitives and unrequited  and taboo  human homosexual love are portrayed  The tagline for the Universe cover was   His  most daring story   31  its sensitive treatment of homosexuality was unusual for science fiction published at that time  and it is now regarded as milestone in science fiction s portrayal of homosexuality  32  According to an anecdote related by Samuel R  Delany  when Sturgeon first submitted the story  the editor  John W  Campbell  not only rejected it but phoned every other editor he knew and urged them to reject it as well  33  34  Sturgeon would later write Affair with a Green Monkey  which examined social stereotyping of homosexuals  and in 1960 published Venus Plus X  in which a single gender society is depicted and the protagonist s homophobia portrayed unfavourably  22  Images of homosexual male societies remained strongly negative in the eyes of most SF authors  For example  when overpopulation drives the world away from heterosexuality in Charles Beaumont s short story  The Crooked Man   1955   first published in Playboy  inhumane homosexuals begin to oppress the heterosexual minority  In Anthony Burgess s The Wanting Seed  1962  homosexuality is required for official employment  Burgess treats this as one aspect of an unnatural state of affairs which includes violent warfare and the failing of the natural world  22  Although not usually identified as a genre writer  William S  Burroughs produced works with a surreal narrative that estranged the action from the ordinary world as science fiction and fantasy do  In 1959 he published Naked Lunch  the first of many works such as The Nova Trilogy and The Wild Boys in which he linked drug use and homosexuality as anti authoritarian activities  1   edit  The New Wave era  1960 70s  In a little more than a decade  from the late 1960s to 1980  the number of works which contained homosexuality in science fiction and fantasy more than doubled all that had come previously  Eric Garber  Lyn Paleo   Preface  in Uranian worlds  35  By the late 1960s  science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by the civil rights movement and the emergence of a counterculture  36  Within the genres  these changes were incorporated into a movement called  the New Wave   27  a movement more sceptical of technology  more liberated socially  and more interested in stylistic experimentation  36  New Wave writers were more likely to claim an interest in  inner space  instead of outer space  They were less shy about explicit sexuality and more sympathetic to reconsiderations of gender roles and the social status of sexual minorities  Under the influence of New Wave editors and authors such as Michael Moorcock  editor of the influential New Worlds   sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality and gender multiplied in science fiction and fantasy  becoming commonplace  2  36  37  The introduction of gay imagery has also been attributed to the influence of lesbian feminist and gay liberation movements in the 1960s  38  In the 1970s  lesbians and gay men became a more visible presence in the SF community and as writers  notable gay authors included Joanna Russ  Thomas M  Disch and Samuel R  Delany  39  Feminist SF authors imagined cultures in which homo  and bisexuality and a variety of gender models were the norm  2 Joanna Russ s The Female Man  1975  and the award winning story  When It Changed   showing a female only lesbian society that flourished without men  were enormously influential  38  Russ is largely responsible for introducing radical lesbian feminism into science fiction  40  she has stated that being openly lesbian was bad for her career and sales  11  Similar themes are explored in James Tiptree Jr  s award winning  Houston  Houston  Do You Read   d   which presents a female only society after the extinction of men from disease  The society lacks stereotypically  male  problems such as war  but is stagnant  The women reproduce via cloning and consider men to be comical  Tiptree was a closeted bisexual woman writing secretly under a male pseudonym  41  42  43  and explored the sexual impulse as her main theme  2  Other feminist utopias do not include lesbianism  Ursula K  Le Guin s The Left Hand of Darkness  1969  depicts trans species sexuality  in which individuals are neither  male  nor  female  but can have both male and female sexual organs and reproductive abilities  making them in some senses bisexual  2  In The Language of the Night  a collection of Le Guin s criticism  she admits to having  quite unnecessarily locked the Gethenians into heterosexuality     the omission  of the homosexual option  implies that sexuality is heterosexuality  I regret this very much   44  Le Guin often explores alternative sexuality in her works  45  and has subsequently written many stories that examine the possibilities SF allows for non traditional homosexuality  46  such as the bisexual bonding between clones in  Nine Lives   e  37  47  Sexual themes and fluid genders also figure in the works of John Varley  who came to prominence in the 1970s  2  Many of his stories contain mentions of same sex love and gay and lesbian characters  48  In his  Eight Worlds  suite of stories and novels  humanity has achieved the ability to change sex on a whim  Homophobia is shown to initially inhibit uptake of this technology  as in his story  Options   as it engenders drastic changes in relationships  with bisexuality eventually becoming the norm for society  49  His Gaea trilogy features lesbian protagonists  and almost all the characters are to some degree bisexual  50  Cover from the first edition of Aye  and Gomorrah  and other stories Samuel R  Delany was one of the first openly gay science fiction authors  12  51  in his earliest stories the gay sexual aspect appears as a  sensibility   rather than in overt sexual references  In some stories  such as Babel 17  1966   same sex love and same sex intercourse are clearly implied but are given a kind of protective colouration because the protagonist is a woman who is involved in a three person marriage with two men  The affection all three characters share for each other is in the forefront  and sexual activity between or among them is not directly described  In Dhalgren  1975   his most famous science fiction novel  Delany peoples his large canvas with characters of a wide variety of sexualities  52  Once again  sexual activity is not the focus of the novel although there are some of the first explicitly described scenes of gay sex in SF and Delany depicts characters with a wide variety of motivations and behaviours  53  Delany s Nebula winning short story  Aye  and Gomorrah  posits the development of neutered human astronauts and then depicts the people who become sexually oriented toward them  By imagining a new gender and resultant sexual orientation  the story allows readers to reflect on the real world while maintaining an estranging distance  Further award winning stories featuring gay characters  such as  Time Considered as a Helix of Semi Precious Stones   were to follow  all collected in Delany s short story retrospective Aye  and Gomorrah  and other stories  37  Delany faced censorship from book distribution companies for treatment of these topics  2  In later works  gay themes become increasingly central to Delany s works  attracting controversy  54  and some blur the line between science fiction and gay pornography  55  Delany s SF series Return to Neveryon was the first novel from a major US publisher to deal with the impact of AIDS  56  and he later won the William Whitehead Memorial Award for lifetime achievement in gay and lesbian writing  57  Reading over any large body of science fiction referring to gay men and women  one can t avoid seeing it as a system of stereotypes with a few more or less effective tries at a kind of fashionable liberalism Samuel Delany   Introduction  in Uranian worlds  7  Other big name SF authors approached LGBT themes in individual works  In Time Enough for Love  1973  by Robert A  Heinlein  the main character argues strongly for the future liberty of homosexual sex  but sex for the purpose of procreation remains held as the ideal  2  46  The female bisexuality in Stranger in a Strange Land  1961  has been described as mere titilation and male homosexuality in the same work was a  wrongness  deserving pity  58  Heinlein s use of sexuality is discussed in an essay entitled  The Embarrassments of Science Fiction  by SF writer Thomas Disch  59  Disch was publicly gay from 1968  this came out occasionally in his poetry and particularly in his novel On Wings of Song  1979   His other major SF novels also contained bisexual characters  in his mosaic novel 334  gay people are referred to as  republicans  in contrast to the straight  democrats   However  he did not try to write to a particular community   I m gay myself  but I don t write  gay  literature   60  Elizabeth Lynn is an openly lesbian science fiction and fantasy writer who has written numerous works featuring positive gay protagonists  61  Her Chronicles of Tornor novels  1979 80   the first of which won the World Fantasy Award  were among the first fantasy novels to have gay relationships as an unremarkable part of the cultural background  and included explicit and sympathetic depictions of same sex love  62  the third novel is of particular lesbian interest  61  Her SF novel A Different Light  1978  featured a same sex relationship between two men  63  and inspired the name of the LGBT bookstore and chain  A Different Light   64  65  The  magical lesbian tale   The Woman Who Loved the Moon  also won a World Fantasy Award and is the title story in the Lynn s The Woman Who Loved the Moon  a collection also containing other gay speculative fiction stories  61  66   edit  Modern SF  post New Wave  Lesbians and gay men have become less alien in the world of SF in the last little while  we have  indeed  experienced a minor boom in the publishing of stories of  alternative sexuality   Despite this  we remain aliens within that world in many of the same ways that our characters are aliens within those stories  Wendy Pearson  Science Fiction Studies  67  After the pushing back of boundaries in the 1960s and 70s  homosexuality gained much wider acceptance  and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional SF stories with little comment  This was helped by the growing number of openly gay or lesbian authors  37  such as David Gerrold  Geoff Ryman  16 Nicola Griffith and Melissa Scott  68  In the 1980s  blatant homophobia was no longer considered acceptable to most readers  37  However  depictions of unrealistic lesbians continue to propagate for the titillation of straight men in genre works  69  In the 1990s  stories depicting alternative sexualities experienced a resurgence  67  Cyberpunk  a genre arising in the mid 1980s  has been seen as heteronormative and masculine to a large extent  although feminist and  queer  interpretations are mooted by some critics  70  71  Melissa Scott  a lesbian writer  has written several cyberpunk works that prominently feature LGBT characters  including Lambda award winning Trouble and Her Friends  1994  and Shadow Man  1995   the latter having also been inducted into the Gaylactic Spectrum Hall of Fame  72  73  Scott has reported that reviewers called some of these works  too gay  for mixing cyberpunk clich s with political themes  68  Many of Scott s other SF works also contain LGBT themes  she said that she chooses to write about gay themes using SF because these genres allow her to explore situations in which LGBT people are treated better or worse than in reality  and that it also gives an estranging distance for readers averse to such themes  who might otherwise feel accused of similar discriminatory practices as those in the books  68  Uranian Worlds  by Eric Garber and Lyn Paleo  was compiled in 1983 and is an authoritative guide to science fiction literature featuring gay  lesbian  transgender  and related themes  The book covers science fiction literature published before 1990  2nd edition  1990   providing a short review and commentary on each piece  35  74  A number of LGBT themed anthologies of speculative short fiction have been published since the 1980s  the first being the science fiction themed Kindred Spirits  1984   edited by Jeffrey M  Elliot  These anthologies often focus on particular sexual identities  such as the New Exploits of Lesbians series with titles in the fantasy  Magical lesbians  Fairy tale lesbians  and horror  Twilight lesbians  areas  Others are grouped around particular genres  such as the award winning Bending the Landscape series edited by Nicola Griffith and Stephen Pagel  in which each of the three volumes focus upon science fiction  fantasy or horror  or the horror oriented Queer Fear anthologies  edited by Michael Rowe  Gay characters became common enough that Diana Wynne Jones  The Tough Guide to Fantasyland contains an entry on gay mages as a fantasy cliche  75  Such characters are found in Mercedes Lackey s works  76  such as the Lambda award winning The Last Herald Mage trilogy  1989   in which the protagonists are gay 1  and have magical powers  Their relationships are an integral part of the story  which takes places in the fictional country of Valdemar  Much of the extended series provides non heterosexual role models for younger readers  77  David Gerrold is an openly gay science fiction writer with a number of LGBT themed works  The Man Who Folded Himself examines the narcissistic love of a time traveler who has gay orgies with alternate versions of himself  including female and lesbian versions  78  Gerrold s multi award winning Jumping Off the Planet  2000  is the first book in a young adult series  in which a father kidnaps his three sons and goes to the moon  one son is gay  and rejected from college as he is ineligible for a scholarship available to straight people who agree to have their sexual orientation changed to prevent overpopulation  Gerrold received a Nebula award for a semi autobiographical short story  The Martian Child   1994   in which a gay man adopts a child  The story was later expanded to book length  and a feature film was produced in which the protagonist was straight  causing criticism  79  80  81  Geoff Ryman has produced a string of award winning novels and short stories that prominently feature LGBT characters  The Child Garden s  1989  protagonist cannot conform to the future society due to her resistance to genetic manipulation and her lesbian nature  which leads her into a relationship to a similarly outcast lesbian polar bear  Lust follows a gay man who finds that his sexual fantasies are magically coming true  Was  1992  includes a gay actor with AIDS and a mentally challenged abused child  linked by their connection to The Wizard of Oz books and film  82  In a Locus magazine interview Ryman claimed that the gay and SF genre markets are incompatible   In 1990  if you had asked me which was the worst thing to be labeled as  gay or an SF writer  I d have said gay  kills you stone dead in the market  Then Was came out     They had it in the gay section of bookstores and they had stuff in gay magazines  but they didn t say SF   at which point I realized that being a science fiction writer is worse than being gay   16  The post publication revelation that Dumbledore  a secondary character in the Harry Potter series  was gay caused some controversy  in spite of his sexuality never having been shown in the books  83  The Nightrunner Series  by Lynn Flewelling  is a fantasy series about a spy thief and his prot g  who become embroiled in political intrigues and magical mysteries in the fictional land of Skala  The two main male characters  Seregil and Alec  eventually form a romantic relationship by the ending of the second book  Stalking Darkness  It s Always Spring Break Somewhere In The Galaxy  a comic science fiction adventure by Raven c s  McCracken  features a rock and roll band made up of college age technical prodigies who invent interstellar space travel  Two of the four main characters  Lisa and Christine  have an ongoing tangled romantic sexual relationship throughout the book  The Mortal Instruments Series by Cassandra Clare contains a homosexual relationship between two side characters  Alec and Magnus  Although their relationship isn t a focus point of the series  Alec s struggle with coming out to his parents and friends does feature  The character Magnus claims to be bisexual   edit  Comics and manga See also  LGBT themes in comics For much of the 20th century  gay relationships were discouraged from being shown in comics which were seen mainly as directed towards children  Until 1989  the Comics Code Authority  CCA   which imposed de facto censorship on comics sold through news stands in the United States  forbade any suggestion of homosexuality  84  Artists had to drop subtle hints while not stating directly a character s orientation  85  Overt gay and lesbian themes were first found in underground and alternative titles which did not carry the CCA s seal of approval  The CCA came into being in response to Fredric Wertham s Seduction of the Innocent  in which comic book creators were accused of attempting to negatively influence children with images of violence and sexuality  including subliminal homosexuality  Wertham claimed Wonder Woman s strength and independence made her a lesbian  86  and stated that  The Batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies   87  In recent years the number of LGBT characters has increased greatly in mainstream superhero comics  however  LGBT characters continue to be relegated to supporting roles  and generate criticism for the treatment gay characters receive  88   edit  Marvel Alpha Flight s Northstar was the first major gay character in the Marvel universe and remains the most famous gay character in mainstream comics  Created by Marvel comics in 1979 as a member of the original Alpha Flight superhero team  Northstar s sexual identity was hinted at early in his history  in 1983 in issues 7 and 8 of Alpha Flight  but not openly stated  his apparent lack of interest in women was chalked up to his obsessive drive to win as a ski champion  89  90  The character was finally revealed to be gay in 1992 s Alpha Flight issue 106 and his outing made national headlines  91  In 2002  Marvel Comics revived The Rawhide Kid in their Marvel MAX imprint  92  introducing the first openly gay comic book character to star in his own magazine  93  The first edition of the Rawhide Kid s gay saga was called Slap Leather  According to a CNN  com article  the character s sexuality is conveyed indirectly  through euphemisms and puns  and the comic s style is campy  93  Conservative groups quickly protested the gay take on the character and claimed that children would be corrupted by it  and the covers carried an  Adults only  label  Marvel s policy had stated that all series emphasizing solo gay characters must carry an  Adults Only  label  in response to conservative protests  But in 2006  Marvel editor in chief Joe Quesada claimed that this policy was no longer in force  94  and Marvel received GLAAD s 2005 Best Comic Book Award for its superhero comic book Young Avengers  which included gay characters but was published as a mainstream book with no warning label  94  95   edit  DC DC has been noted to have greater representation of LGBT characters than its rival Marvel comics  although still drawing criticism for its use of stereotypes  Firebrand  a superhero debuting in 1941  is thought by some to be an early example  with his pink or transparent costume  96  Writer Roy Thomas penned thought balloons that suggested Firebrand had been involved in a gay relationship with his sidekick and bodyguard Slugger Dunn  96  although these hints never moved beyond subtext  A more modern example is the violent vigilante superhero Midnighter  The Batman like Midnighter was shown as being in a relationship with the Superman like Apollo during their time as members of the superhero team The Authority  97  Midnighter and Apollo are now married and have an adopted daughter   Midnighter has gone on to star in his own title  In 2006  DC Comics could still draw widespread media attention by announcing a new  lesbian incarnation of the well known character Batwoman  98  99  100  even though openly lesbian minor characters such as Gotham City police officer Renee Montoya already existed in the franchise  101  102  Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson  Panel from Batman  84  June 1954   page 24  In addition to true LGBT characters  there has been controversy over various homosexual interpretations of the most famous superhero comic book characters  Batman s relationship with Robin has famously come under scrutiny  in spite of the majority of creators associated with the creator denying that the character is gay  103  Psychologist Fredric Wertham  who in Seduction of the Innocent asserted that  Batman stories are psychologically homosexual   claimed to find a  subtle atmosphere of homoeroticism which pervades the adventures of the mature  Batman  and his young friend  Robin    87  It has also been claimed that Batman is interesting to gay audiences because  he was one of the first fictional characters to be attacked on the grounds of his presumed homosexuality   and  the 1960s TV series remains a touchstone of camp   104 Frank Miller has described the relationship between Batman and the Joker as a  homophobic nightmare   105  he views the character as sublimating his sexual urges into crime fighting  105  Some continue to play off the homosexual interpretations of Batman  One notable example occurred in 2000  when DC Comics refused to allow permission for the reprinting of four panels  from Batman  79  92  105 and 139  to illustrate Christopher York s paper All in the Family  Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s  106  Another happened in the summer of 2005  when painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of watercolors depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses  107  DC threatened both artist and the Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts gallery with legal action if they did not cease selling the works and demanded all remaining art  as well as any profits derived from them  108   edit  Manga Yaoi and Yuri  also known as Boys  Love and Girls  Love  respectively  as well as Sh nen ai and Sh jo ai in the West  although these are not used in Japan due to pedophilic undertones  are Japanese genres which have homosexual romance themes  across a variety of media  Yaoi and yuri have spread beyond Japan  both translated and original yaoi and yuri is now available in many countries and languages  The characters of yaoi and yuri do not tend to self identify as homosexual or bisexual  109  110  111  As with much manga and anime  SF and fantasy tropes and environments are common  For example Ai no Kusabi  a 1980s yaoi light novel series described as a  magnum opus  of the Boys Love genre  112  involves a science fictional caste system  Simoun has been described as being  a wonderful sci fi series  113  which does not have to rely on its yuri content to appeal to the audience  114  Yaoi has been criticised for stereotypical and homophobic portrayals of its characters  115  116  117  118  and failing to address gay issues  116  119 Homophobia  when it is presented as an issue at all  120  is used as a plot device to  heighten the drama   121  or to show the purity of the leads  love  116  Matt Thorn has suggested that as BL is a romance narrative  having strong political themes may be a  turn off  to the readers  122  Critics state that the genre challenges heteronormativity via the  queer  bish nen  123  124  There is also a style of manga called Bara  which is typically written by gay men for a gay male adult audience  Bara often has more realistic themes than yaoi and is more likely to acknowledge homophobia and the taboo nature of homosexuality in Japan  While western commentators sometimes group bara and yaoi together  writers and fans consider them separate genres  125   edit  Film and television In general  speculative fiction on television and film has lagged behind literature in its portrayals of homosexuality  126  Sexual relationships in major speculative fiction franchises have generally been depicted as heterosexual in nature  Inter species and inter ethnic relationships have been commonly depicted  while homosexual and transgendered  LGBT  relationships are more rare   edit  Film LGBT characters in films began to appear more regularly only in the 1980s  126  Films in the late 1920s and early 1930s reflected the liberal attitudes of the day and could include sexual innuendos and references to homosexuality  127  but from the 1930s until 1968 the film industry in the US followed the Production Code  a set of censorship guidelines written by a Jesuit priest  The code spelled out what was morally acceptable for a public audience  references to sexual  perversions  such as homosexuality were forbidden  128  129  Virtually all motion pictures produced in the United States adhered to the code  130  and similar censorship was common in other countries  for example an early version of the first lesbian vampire film Dracula s Daughter  131  a film described in The Celluloid Closet as presenting  homosexuality as a predatory weakness   132  was rejected by the British Board of Film Censors in 1935  who said in part     Dracula s Daughter would require half a dozen     languages to adequately express its beastliness    133  Horror author Anne Rice has named Dracula s Daughter as a direct inspiration for her own homoerotic vampire fiction  134  naming a bar in her novel Queen of the Damned  Dracula s Daughter  in honor of the film  135  Films produced under such censorship could only introduce homosexuality as a disguised undercurrent  and still flirted with controversy in doing so  such as in the cult horror film White Zombie  136  137  The less stringent rules of the post Hayes film industry allowed sexuality to be more open  and cinema as a whole became more sexually explicit from the 1980s in particular  2  but aimed to purely to entertain rather than exploring underlying sexual dynamics  Much of the sex in speculative fiction film is merely intended to titillate  2  a review of fantasy films identified 10 15  as softcore pornography  138  but it remained rare to see gay characters in speculative fiction films  Horror films  that had sex as one of their major preoccupations  continued to be more leniently censored  due to the perception of being unserious and lightweight  Vampires in particular have been described as obvious erotic metaphors and as a result  numerous vampire films since the 1970s strongly imply or explicitly show lesbianism  following the inspiration of lesbian vampire story Carmilla  139  The prototypical hollywood vampire  Dracula  was shown to be openly gay in the spoof film Does Dracula Suck  in 1969  139  Gay genre films remain rare  140  and science fiction films  inclusion of gay characters continues to relegate them to supporting roles  such as the  stereotypical  limp wristed  frantic homosexual  minor character in the 1996 blockbuster Independence Day  141  a film whose main theme has been described as being the anxiety surrounding male friendships and homosexual panic  142  It is also interesting to note that the film s director  Roland Emmerich  is openly gay  Still in this bleak panorama there are some curious cases like Cthulhu  2007  a horror thriller film based on the works of H  P  Lovecraft  in which the main character is gay but it isn t the main thing  although it is important in the development of the character s psychology  The film is plagued with monsters and disturbing happenings  Also  in V for Vendetta there are two secondary characters   one gay  one lesbian   shown as victims of the totalitarian dystopia   edit  Television LGBT characters began appearing on television with increasing frequency only in the 1990s  126  The 1994 television science fiction show  Babylon 5 introduced a bisexual character  Susan Ivanova whose relationship with a fellow female telepath was revealed in season 2  1995   Advocate magazine called this relationship out as the closest that the Star Trek franchise or any  Star Trek clone   as he called the show  had come to a  gay creature much less a gay human being   143  Babylon 5 continued to explore the state of same sex relationships in the future with the introduction of a male male marriage and subsequent honeymoon as cover for two of the main characters who were on a covert mission to a Mars colony in season 4  144  Willow and Tara s first on screen kiss in the episode  The Body   The Xena  Warrior Princess fantasy television series introduced its main characters  Xena and Gabrielle  as close companions  fan speculation about lesbian overtones led to them becoming lesbian icons  although the lesbian content remained at the subtext level  145  146  The series has been cited as  trail blazing  and breaking down barriers  allowing the production of subsequent programming such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer  147  which introduced a number of LGBT characters  The most famous is the major character  Willow and her partners Tara and Kennedy  148  Although praised for their  healthy relationship  and being the first lesbian relationship between major characters on prime time television  others criticised the use of witchcraft as a metaphor for lesbian sex  149  Tara s death directly after reconciliatory sex with Willow caused an outcry amongst the LGBT community  who saw it as a  homophobic clich    149 Andrew Wells  a recurring villain and eventual ally  was strongly implied to be gay  although closeted  150  The series was influential on subsequent television speculative fiction  including Torchwood  151  152  The series won a number of LGBT themed awards  153  and was regarded as groundbreaking in its portrayal of gay youth  154  155  Torchwood is a British science fiction drama television programme  part of the long running Doctor Who franchise  which began airing in 2006 on BBC Three  The series explores several themes in its narrative  in particular LGBT themes  Various characters are portrayed as sexually fluid  through those characters  the series examines homosexual and bisexual relationships  Although the nature of their sexual flexibility is not explicitly discussed  the characters offer varying perspectives on orientation  156  with The Sun describing all of the characters on Torchwood as bisexual  157  Series creator Russell T Davies has said that he hopes to defy audience expectations of monosexual characters   Without making it political or dull  this is going to be a very bisexual programme  I want to knock down the barriers so we can t define which of the characters is gay  We need to start mixing things up  rather than thinking   This is a gay character and he ll only ever go off with men    156  Davies has also described Jack Harkness as omnisexual   He ll shag anything with a hole  Jack doesn t categorise people  if he fancies you  he ll do it with you   158  The inclusion of significant LGBT characters in modern speculative fiction television series has not been universal  For example the Star Trek franchise s lack of same sex relationships has long been a sore spot with LGBT fandom  6  159  some of whom have organised boycotts against the franchise to protest its failure to include LGBT characters  They also point out that Gene Roddenberry had made statements in later life favourable to acceptance of homosexuality and the portrayal of same sex relationships in Star Trek  but that the franchise s coverage has remained meagre  159  Within the Star Trek canon  there have been no officially recognized LGBT characters in the television spin offs  The International Review of Science Fiction ran a feature entitled  Prisoners of Dogma and Prejudice  Why There Are no G L B T Characters in Star Trek  Deep Space 9  160  However  gender identity has occasionally been treated as an  issue  within the new Star Trek series  to be dealt with as a theme in individual episodes  such as the 1995 Star Trek  Deep Space Nine episode  Rejoined   which was the first episode of the show to feature a same sex relationship and romantic same sex kiss between women  Subsequently  the Star Trek franchise has portrayed a few same sex kisses  but always in the context of either the evil  mirror universe    The Emperor s New Cloak   or body possession   Warlord  and others   and often for comedic purposes between otherwise heterosexual characters  In a 2000 Fandom interview  Star Trek screenwriter Ronald D  Moore suggested that the reason why no gay characters existed in the television franchise was because someone wanted it that way  and no amount of support from fans  cast or crew was going to make any difference  161  In recent years  a few of the Star Trek novels and comics  which are officially licensed but not considered canon  have featured serious direct same sex relationships  including portraying a minor canon character as gay  162   edit  Slash fiction Main articles  Slash fiction and Femslash The platonic close male relationships in television and film science fiction have been reinterpreted by fans as slash fiction   Kirk Spock being the earliest example  163  Slash cannot be commercially distributed due to copyright  and until the 1990s was either undistributed or published in zines  164  With the advent of the internet  the slash fiction community of fans and writers began to cluster at sites such as fanfiction net  165  and websites and fanzines dedicated to popular speculative fiction franchises such as X files and Star Trek have become common  The use of characters from major SF franchises in  gay readings  has caused legal action  LucasFilm has sent cease and desist orders to prevent gay reinterpretations of Star Wars characters  166  and Anne Rice is notorious for attempts to stop production of slash fiction based on her Vampire Chronicles characters  although many of the characters are bisexual in canon  167  Slash fiction has been described as important to the LGBT community and the formation of queer identities  as it represents a resistance to the expectation of compulsory heterosexuality  168  but has also been noted as being unrepresentative of the gay community  being more a medium to express feminist dissatisfactions with SF  169  According to polls  most of slash fandom is made up of heterosexual women with a college degree  170  These demographics are older than the yaoi fans and they tend to be more easily disturbed about slash depicting underage sexuality  171  but this is becoming less true due to the popularity of Harry Potter inspired slash fiction  172  Femslash is a subgenre of slash fiction which focuses on romantic and or sexual relationships between female fictional characters  173  Typically  characters featured in femslash are heterosexual in the canon universe  however  similar fan fiction about lesbian characters are commonly labeled as femslash for convenience  174  There is less femslash than there is slash based on male couples   it has been suggested that heterosexual female slash authors generally do not write femslash  175  and that it is rare to find a fandom with two sufficiently engaging female characters  176  Janeway Seven is the main Star Trek femslash pairing  as only they have  an on screen relationship fraught with deep emotional connection and conflict   177  There is debate about whether fanfiction about canon lesbians such as Willow and Tara of Buffy the Vampire Slayer counts as  slash   their relationship storylines are more coy than heterosexual ones  which entices Willow Tara femslash authors to fill in the gaps in the known relationship storyline  178  It is  relatively recently  that male writers have begun writing femslash  179   edit  Reaction of the speculative fiction community Logo of the Gaylactic Network There has been a long history of tolerance of LGBT people in SF fandom  The presence of gay members was noted by attendees of early conventions  but generally not discussed   the idea that gay or lesbian members would seek recognition within the SF community was  unthinkable   and an accusation in the 1940s by a fanzine editor that the Los Angeles Science Fiction Association was  full of gay members  caused a scandal in fan circles  11  180  Prominent SF fan Forrest Ackerman is regarded as one of the first members of fandom to openly support the gay and lesbian movements  He was known for writing early lesbian fiction and aided in the publication of The Ladder  the journal of the recently formed lesbian group the Daughters of Bilitis  180  He claims the group named him an honorary lesbian for his support  and to have pseudonymously written the earliest work of  lesbian SF  in 1947 in Vice Versa  the lesbian fanzine edited by Lisa Ben  180  As the number of works featuring LGBT characters increased  so did the visibility of LGBT fans  At least as early as the 1980 Worldcon  Noreascon Two   there were gatherings of gay and gay friendly members of the SF community  including Samuel R  Delany  Marion Zimmer Bradley and Melissa Scott  181  However  such meetings did not necessarily indicate whole hearted acceptance within the fan community  and gay and lesbian fans were not regarded as a unified interest group  Informal gatherings at conferences and the attempted creation of a newsletter for LGBT fans drew little notice  182  Networking between gay fans continued  finally coalescing at the 1986 Worldcon into a plan of action  This led to the first Gaylaxicon science fiction convention being held in 1988 and subsequently to the creation of the Gaylactic Network and the Gaylactic Spectrum Awards by the science fiction community  182  183  184  185  Gay themed discussions are now a staple at conventions such as WisCon  for example  WisCon 30 featured a panel discussing  Why Women Write About Gay Men   and the 38th World Science Fiction Convention in Boston had a discussion panel entitled  The Closed Open Mind   Homophobia in Science Fiction and Fantasy Stories   33  Other SF authors  such as Orson Scott Card  have been criticised by the LGBT community for their works or opinions  which have been described as homophobic  186  Some lesbian science fiction is targeted specifically to a lesbian audience  rather than science fiction fans  and published by small feminist or lesbian presses such as Bella Books  187  188  A notable author writing science fiction published by lesbian presses is Katherine V  Forrest  189   edit  LGBT speculative fiction awards The Lambda Literary Award Medal Design 2008 A number of awards exist that recognise works at the intersection of LGBT and speculative fiction  190  The Gaylactic Spectrum Awards honour works in science fiction  fantasy and horror which include positive explorations of gay  lesbian  bisexual or transgendered characters  themes  or issues  The awards were instituted in 1999 and are given for best novel  short fiction and other works of the previous year  Works produced before the awards  inception are eligible for entry into the Hall of Fame  191  The Lambda Literary Awards include awards for science fiction  fantasy and horror  The awards were first presented in 1989  with separate categories for speculative fiction for lesbians and gay men  In 1993 these categories were merged and the combined award has undergone several name changes since then  Although the awards are given based on the quality of the writing and the LGBT themes  the author s sexual orientation is also a factor  192  The James Tiptree  Jr  Award honours works of science fiction or fantasy that expand or explore one s understanding of gender  193  Thus  it often goes to works which deal directly or tangentially with gay  lesbian  bisexual or transgender issues  194  Golden Crown Literary Society Awards  or  Goldies   are given to works containing lesbian themes or depictions of lesbian characters  Awards are given in numerous categories  including speculative fiction  or  SciFi Fantasy Horror   and paranormal romance  195
