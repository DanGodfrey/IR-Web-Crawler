December 28  1973  was born in Scarborough  Maine  11  They were married July 23  1939  in Cumberland County  Maine  11  Stephen King was born September 21  1947  in Portland  Maine  When King was two years old  his father left the family under the pretense of  going to buy a pack of cigarettes   leaving his mother to raise King and his adopted older brother  David  by herself  sometimes under great financial strain  The family moved to De Pere  Wisconsin  Fort Wayne  Indiana and Stratford  Connecticut  When King was eleven years old  the family returned to Durham  Maine  where Ruth King cared for her parents until their deaths  She then became a caregiver in a local residential facility for the mentally challenged  12  King was raised Methodist  13  As a child  King apparently witnessed one of his friends being struck and killed by a train  though he has no memory of the event  His family told him that after leaving home to play with the boy  King returned  speechless and seemingly in shock  Only later did the family learn of the friend s death  Some commentators have suggested that this event may have psychologically inspired some of King s darker works  14  but King makes no mention of it in his memoir On Writing  15  King s primary inspiration for writing horror fiction was related in detail in his 1981 non fiction Danse Macabre  in a chapter titled  An Annoying Autobiographical Pause   King makes a comparison of his uncle successfully dowsing for water using the bough of an apple branch with the sudden realization of what he wanted to do for a living  While browsing through an attic with his elder brother  King uncovered a paperback version of an H P  Lovecraft collection of short stories entitled The Lurker in the Shadows that had belonged to his father  The cover art an illustration of a yellow green Demon hiding within the recesses of a Hellish cavern beneath a tombstone was  he writes  the moment in his life which  that interior dowsing rod responded to   King told Barnes  amp  Noble Studios during a 2009 interview   I knew that I d found home when I read that book   16  Education and early career King attended Durham Elementary School and graduated from Lisbon Falls High School  in Lisbon Falls  Maine  He displayed an early interest in horror as an avid reader of EC s horror comics  including Tales from the Crypt  he later paid tribute to the comics in his screenplay for Creepshow   He began writing for fun while still in school  contributing articles to Dave s Rag  the newspaper that his brother published with a mimeograph machine  and later began selling stories to his friends which were based on movies he had seen  though when discovered by his teachers  he was forced to return the profits   The first of his stories to be independently published was  I Was a Teenage Grave Robber   serialized over three published and one unpublished issue of a fanzine  Comics Review  in 1965  17  That story was published the following year in a revised form as  In a Half World of Terror  in another fanzine  Stories of Suspense  edited by Marv Wolfman  18  From 1966  King studied English at the University of Maine  graduating in 1970 with a Bachelor of Arts in English  That same year his first daughter  Naomi Rachel  was born  He wrote a column for the student newspaper  The Maine Campus  titled  Steve King s Garbage Truck   took part in a writing workshop organized by Burton Hatlen  1  and took odd jobs to pay for his studies  including one at an industrial laundry  He sold his first professional short story   The Glass Floor   to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967  12  The Fogler Library at the University of Maine now holds many of King s papers  After leaving the university  King earned a certificate to teach high school but  being unable to find a teaching post immediately  initially supplemented his laboring wage by selling short stories to men s magazines such as Cavalier  Many of these early stories have been published in the collection Night Shift  In 1971  King married Tabitha Spruce  a fellow student at the University of Maine whom he had met at the University s Fogler Library after one of Professor Hatlen s workshops  1  That fall  King was hired as a teacher at Hampden Academy in Hampden  Maine  He continued to contribute short stories to magazines and worked on ideas for novels  12  It was during this time that King developed a drinking problem  which stayed with him for more than a decade  King and his wife  Tabitha  have three children  Naomi  Joe and Owen  Tabitha  Joe and Owen are also published writers  1970s 80s work In 1973  King s novel Carrie was accepted by publishing house Doubleday  King threw an early draft of the novel in the trash after becoming discouraged with his progress writing about a teenage girl with psychic powers  His wife retrieved the manuscript and encouraged him to finish it  19  His advance for Carrie was  2 500  with paperback rights earning  400 000 at a later date  King and his family moved to southern Maine because of his mother s failing health  At this time  he began writing a book titled Second Coming  later titled Jerusalem s Lot  before finally changing the title to  Salem s Lot  published 1975   In a 1987 issue of The Highway Patrolman magazine  he stated   The story seems sort of down home to me  I have a special cold spot in my heart for it   20  Soon after the release of Carrie in 1974  his mother died of uterine cancer  His Aunt Emrine read the novel to her before she died  King has written of his severe drinking problem at this time  stating that he was drunk delivering the eulogy at his mother s funeral  15  After his mother s death  King and his family moved to Boulder  Colorado  where King wrote The Shining  published 1977   The family returned to western Maine in 1975  where King completed his fourth novel  The Stand  published 1978   In 1977  the family  with the addition of Owen Phillip  his third and last child   traveled briefly to England  returning to Maine that fall where King began teaching creative writing at the University of Maine  He has kept his primary residence in Maine ever since  In 1985 King wrote his first work for the comic book medium  21  writing a few pages of the benefit X Men comic book Heroes for Hope Starring the X Men  The book  whose profits were donated to assist with famine relief in Africa  was written by a number of different authors in the comic book field  such as Chris Claremont  Stan Lee  and Alan Moore  as well as authors not primarily associated with that industry  such as Harlan Ellison  22  The following year  King wrote the introduction to Batman  400  an anniversary issue in which he expressed his preference for that character over Superman  23  24  The Dark Tower books Main article  The Dark Tower  series  Stephen King at the Harvard Book Store  January 8  2007 In the late 1970s  King began what became a series of interconnected stories about a lone gunslinger  Roland  who pursues the  Man in Black  in an alternate reality universe that is a cross between J R R  Tolkien s Middle earth and the American wild west as depicted by Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone in their spaghetti westerns  The first of these stories  The Dark Tower  The Gunslinger  was first published in five installments by The Magazine of Fantasy  amp  Science Fiction under the editorship of Edward L  Ferman  beginning in 1977 and the last in 1981  The Gunslinger was continued as a large 7 book epic called The Dark Tower  which were written and published infrequently over four decades  In 1982  the fantasy small press Donald M  Grant  known for publishing the entire canon of Robert E  Howard  printed these stories for the first time together in hardcover form with color and black and white illustrations by fantasy artist Michael Whelan  as The Gunslinger  Each chapter was named for the story previously published in magazine form  King dedicated the hardcover edition to his editor at F amp SF  Ed Ferman  who  took a chance on these stories   The original print run was only 10 000 copies  which was  by this time  a comparatively low run for a first printing of a King novel in hardcover  His 1980 novel  Firestarter  had an initial print run in trade hardcover at 100 000 copies  and his 1983 novel  Christine  had a trade hardcover print run of 250 000 copies  both by the much larger publisher Viking  The Gunslinger s initial release was not highly publicized  and only specialty science fiction and related bookstores carried it on their shelves  The book was generally not available in the larger chain stores  except by special order  Rumors spread among avid fans that there was a King book out that few readers knew about  let alone had actually read  When the initial 10 000 copies sold out  Grant printed another 10 000 copies in 1984  but these runs were still far short of the growing demand among fans for this book  The Dark Tower  The Gunslinger was the beginning of his magnum opus fantasy epic  Both the first and second printings of The Gunslinger garner premium prices on the collectible book market  notably among avid readers and collectors of Stephen King  horror literature  fantasy literature  American western literature  and fans of the artwork of Michael Whelan  In 1987  King released the second installment  The Dark Tower II  The Drawing of the Three  in which Roland draws three people from 20th century United States into his world through magical doors  Grant published The Drawing of the Three with illustrations by Phil Hale in a slightly larger run of 30 000 copies  which was still well below King s typical initial hardcover print run of a new book   It  published in 1986  had an initial print run of 1 000 000 copies  King s largest to date   King had believed that the Dark Tower books would only be of interest to a select group of his fans  and he had resisted releasing it on a larger scale  Finally  in the late 1980s  bowing to pressure from his publishers and fans who were searching for the books  at this point fewer than 50 000 of his millions of readers would have been able to own any of the Dark Tower books   King agreed to release The Gunslinger and all subsequent Dark Tower books in trade paperback and mass market formats  The series reached seven books  with the final installment called The Dark Tower VII  The Dark Tower  in 2004  In the early 2000s King revised the original book  The Gunslinger  because he felt the voice and imagery of the original stories of the late 1970s did not seem to fit the voice of the final installment of 2004  King felt the style of the work had markedly changed during the intervening 27 years  The revised version was published in 2003 by his former hardcover publisher Viking  Grant published its hardcover limited edition of the revised version of The Gunslinger along with a prequel story set in the Dark Tower world called  The Little Sisters of Eluria   originally published in 1998 in the collection Legends  Short Novels by the Masters of Modern Fantasy  in 2009  Adaptations In October 2005  King signed a deal with Marvel Comics to publish a seven issue  miniseries spin off of the series called The Gunslinger Born  The series  which focuses on a young Roland Deschain  is plotted by Robin Furth  with dialogue by Peter David  and illustrated by Eisner Award winning artist Jae Lee  The first issue was published on February 7  2007  and King  David  Lee and Marvel Editor in Chief Joe Quesada appeared at a midnight signing at a Times Square  New York comic book store to promote it  25  26  The work had sold over 200 000 copies by March 2007  The success of The Gunslinger Born led to an ongoing series of miniseries published by Marvel  with Furth and David continuing to collaborate  featuring both adapted material from the Dark Tower books and new material approved by King  it also led to a second series of King adaptations in the same format  serializing the events of The Stand  Although The Hollywood Reporter announced in February 2007 that plans were underway for Lost co creator J  J  Abrams to do an adaptation of King s epic Dark Tower series  5  Abrams stated in a November 2009 interview with MTV that he would not be adapting the series  27  Akiva Goldsman  Ron Howard and Brian Grazer will produce a feature film based on The Dark Tower series  with Howard slated to direct  Richard Bachman Main article  Richard Bachman In the late 1970s early 1980s  King published a handful of short novels Rage  1977   The Long Walk  1979   Roadwork  1981   The Running Man  1982  and Thinner  1984  under the pseudonym Richard Bachman  The idea behind this was to test whether he could replicate his success again and to his fears that his popularity was an accident  An alternate explanation was that publishing standards at the time allowed only a single book a year  28  He picked up the name from the hard rock band Bachman Turner Overdrive  of which he is a fan  29  Richard Bachman was exposed as King s pseudonym by a persistent Washington D C  bookstore clerk  Steve Brown  who noticed similarities between the works and later located publisher s records at the Library of Congress that named King as the author of one of Bachman s novels  30  This led to a press release heralding Bachman s  death  supposedly from  cancer of the pseudonym   31  King dedicated his 1989 book The Dark Half  about a pseudonym turning on a writer  to  the deceased Richard Bachman   and in 1996  when the Stephen King novel Desperation was released  the companion novel The Regulators carried the  Bachman  byline  In 2006  during a press conference in London  King declared that he had discovered another Bachman novel  titled Blaze  It was published on June 12  2007  In fact  the original manuscript had been held at King s alma mater  the University of Maine in Orono  for many years and had been covered by numerous King experts  King completely rewrote the original 1973 manuscript for its publication  King has used other pseudonyms  such as John Swithen for The Fifth Quarter  Car accident and thoughts of retirement On June 19  1999 at about 4 30 p m   King was walking on the shoulder of Route 5  in Lovell  Maine  Driver Bryan Smith  distracted by an unrestrained dog moving in the back of his minivan  struck King  who landed in a depression in the ground about 14 feet from the pavement of Route 5  15  According to Oxford County Sheriff deputy Matt Baker  King was hit from behind and some witnesses said the driver was not speeding  reckless  or drinking  32  King was conscious enough to give the deputy phone numbers to contact his family but was in considerable pain  The author was first transported to Northern Cumberland Hospital in Bridgton and then flown by helicopter to Central Maine Medical Center  in Lewiston  His injuries a collapsed right lung  multiple fractures of his right leg  scalp laceration and a broken hip kept him at CMMC until July 9  His leg bones were so shattered doctors initially considered amputating his leg  but stabilized the bones in the leg with an external fixator  33  After five operations in ten days and physical therapy  King resumed work on On Writing in July  though his hip was still shattered and he could only sit for about forty minutes before the pain became worse  Soon it became nearly unbearable  34  King s lawyer and two others purchased Smith s van for  1 500  reportedly to prevent it from appearing on eBay  The van was later crushed at a junkyard  much to King s disappointment  as he dreamed of beating it with a baseball bat once his leg was healed  King later mentioned during an interview with Fresh Air s Terry Gross that he wanted to completely destroy the vehicle himself with a pickaxe  35  During this time  Tabitha King was inspired to redesign his studio  King visited the space while his books and belongings were packed away  What he saw was an image of what his studio would look like if he died  providing a seed for his novel Lisey s Story  36  In 2002  King announced he would stop writing  apparently motivated in part by frustration with his injuries  which had made sitting uncomfortable and reduced his stamina  He has since resumed writing  but states on his website that   I m writing but I m writing at a much slower pace than previously and I think that if I come up with something really  really good  I would be perfectly willing to publish it because that still feels like the final act of the creative process  publishing it so people can read it and you can get feedback and people can talk about it with each other and with you  the writer  but the force of my invention has slowed down a lot over the years and that s as it should be   37  2000s work In 2000  King published a serialized novel  The Plant  online  bypassing print publication  At first it was presumed by the public that King had abandoned the project because sales were unsuccessful  but he later stated that he had simply run out of stories  38  The unfinished epistolary novel is still available from King s official site  now free  Also in 2000  he wrote a digital novella  Riding the Bullet  and has said he sees e books becoming 50  of the market  probably by 2013 and maybe by 2012   But he also warns   Here s the thing people tire of the new toys quickly   39  In August 2003 King began writing a column on pop culture appearing in Entertainment Weekly  usually every third week  The column is called  The Pop of King   a play on the nickname  The King of Pop  commonly given to Michael Jackson  40  In 2006  King published an apocalyptic novel  Cell  The book features a sudden force in which every cell phone user turns into a mindless killer  King noted in the book s introduction that he does not use cell phones  In 2007  Marvel Comics began publishing comic books based on King s Dark Tower series  followed by adaptations of The Stand in 2008 and The Talisman in 2009  In 2008  King published both a novel  Duma Key  and a collection  Just After Sunset  The latter featured 13 short stories  including a novella  N   which was later released as a serialized animated series that could be seen for free  or  for a small fee  could be downloaded in a higher quality  it then was adopted into a limited comic book series  In 2009  King published Ur  a novella written exclusively for the launch of the second generation Amazon Kindle and available only on Amazon com  and Throttle  a novella co written with his son Joe Hill  which later was released as an audiobook Road Rage  which included Richard Matheson s short story  Duel   On November 10 that year  King s novel  Under the Dome  was published  It is a reworking of an unfinished novel he tried writing twice in the late 1970s and early 1980s  and at 1 074 pages  it is the largest novel he has written since 1986 s It  It debuted at  1 in The New York Times Bestseller List  41  On February 16  2010  King announced on his website that his next book will be a collection of four previously unpublished novellas  The book is called Full Dark  No Stars  In April of that year  King published Blockade Billy  an original novella issued first by independent small press Cemetery Dance Publications and later released in mass market paperback by Simon  amp  Schuster  This baseball related suspense novella is not set to be reprinted in Full Dark  No Stars  The following month  DC Comics premiered American Vampire  a monthly comic book series written by King with short story writer Scott Snyder  and illustrated by Rafael Albuquerque  which represents King s first original comics work  42  43  44  King s next novel  11 22 63  was published November 8  2011  45  46  and the eighth Dark Tower volume  The Wind Through the Keyhole  was published in 2012  47  Collaborations King has written two novels with acclaimed horror novelist Peter Straub  The Talisman and a sequel  Black House  King has indicated that he and Straub will likely write the third and concluding book in this series  the tale of Jack Sawyer  but has set no time for its completion  King also wrote the nonfiction book  Faithful  with novelist and fellow Red Sox fanatic Stewart O Nan  In 1996 King collaborated with Michael Jackson to create Ghosts  a 40 minute musical video in which the singer portrays a recluse living in a mansion confronting an unwelcoming group of townsfolk initially calling for his exodus from their community   Throttle   a novella written in collaboration with his son Joe Hill  appears in the anthology He Is Legend  Celebrating Richard Matheson   Gauntlet Press  2009   48  The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer  My Life at Rose Red  was a paperback tie in for the King penned miniseries Rose Red  The book was published under anonymous authorship  and written by Ridley Pearson  This spin off is a rare occasion of another author being granted permission to write commercial work using characters and story elements invented by King  King has written a musical play with John Mellencamp titled Ghost Brothers of Darkland County  King played guitar for the rock band Rock Bottom Remainders  several of whose members are authors  Other members include Dave Barry  Ridley Pearson  Scott Turow  Amy Tan  James McBride  Mitch Albom  Roy Blount  Jr   Matt Groening  Kathi Kamen Goldmark  Sam Barry  and Greg Iles  None of them claim to have any musical talent  King is a fan of the rock band AC DC  who did the soundtrack for his 1986 film  Maximum Overdrive  He is also a fan of The Ramones  who wrote the title song for Pet Sematary and appeared in the music video  King referred to the band several times in various novels and stories and The Ramones referenced King on the song  It s Not My Place  In the 9 to 5 World    which is on 1981 s Pleasant Dreams  In addition he wrote the liner notes for their tribute album We re a Happy Family  In 1988  the band Blue  yster Cult recorded an updated version of their 1974 song  Astronomy   The single released for radio play featured a narrative intro spoken by King  49  On Sunday  October 25  2009 the DC Comics Vertigo blog news feed released that King will team up with short story writer Scott Snyder and artist Rafael Albuquerque in a new monthly comic book series from Vertigo in March 2010 called American Vampire  42  King is to write the background history of the very first American vampire  Skinner Sweet  in the five issues of the first arc  Scott Snyder will write the story of Pearl  Both stories are to weave together to form the first story arc  In 2010  King collaborated with musician Shooter Jennings and his band Hierophant  providing the narration for their most recent album  Black Ribbons  Works Main articles  Stephen King bibliography and Short fiction by Stephen King Analysis Writing style King s formula for learning to write well is   Read and write four to six hours a day  If you cannot find the time for that  you can t expect to become a good writer   He sets out each day with a quota of 2000 words and will not stop writing until it is met  He also has a simple definition for talent in writing   If you wrote something for which someone sent you a check  if you cashed the check and it didn t bounce  and if you then paid the light bill with the money  I consider you talented   50  Shortly after his accident  King wrote the first draft of the book Dreamcatcher with a notebook and a Waterman fountain pen  which he called  the world s finest word processor   51  When asked why he writes  King responds   The answer to that is fairly simple there was nothing else I was made to do  I was made to write stories and I love to write stories  That s why I do it  I really can t imagine doing anything else and I can t imagine not doing what I do   52  He is also often asked why he writes such terrifying stories and he answers with another question   Why do you assume I have a choice   53  King often uses authors as characters  or includes mention of fictional books in his stories  novellas and novels  such as Paul Sheldon who is the main character in Misery and Jack Torrance in The Shining  See also List of fictional books in the works of Stephen King for a complete list  In September 2009 it was announced he would serve as a writer for Fangoria  54  Influences King has called Richard Matheson  the author who influenced me most as a writer   15  Both authors casually integrate characters  thoughts into the third person narration  just one of several parallels between their writing styles  In a current edition of Matheson s The Shrinking Man  King is quoted   A horror story if there ever was one   a great adventure story it is certainly one of that select handful that I have given to people  envying them the experience of the first reading   King refers to H  P  Lovecraft several times in Danse Macabre   Gramma   a short story made into a film in the 1980s anthology horror show The New Twilight Zone  mentions Lovecraft s notorious fictional creation Necronomicon  also borrowing the names of a number of the fictional monsters mentioned therein   I Know What You Need  from the 1976 collection Night Shift  and  Salem s Lot also mention the tome  In On Writing  King is critical of Lovecraft s dialogue writing skills  using passages from The Colour Out of Space as particularly poor examples  There are also several examples of King referring to Lovecraftian characters in his work  such as Nyarlathotep and Yog Sothoth  King acknowledges the influence of Bram Stoker  particularly on his novel  Salem s Lot  which he envisioned as a retelling of Dracula  55  Its related short story  Jerusalem s Lot   is reminiscent of Stoker s The Lair of the White Worm  citation needed  King has also referenced author Shirley Jackson   Salem s Lot opens with a quotation from Jackson s The Haunting of Hill House  and a character in Wolves of the Calla references the Jackson book We Have Always Lived in the Castle  King is a fan of John D  MacDonald  and dedicated the novella  Sun Dog  to MacDonald  saying  I miss you  old friend   For his part  MacDonald wrote an admiring preface to Night Shift  and even had his famous character  Travis McGee  reading Cujo in one of the last McGee novels and Pet Sematary in the last McGee novel  The Lonely Silver Rain  In 1987 King s Philtrum Press published Don Robertson s novel  The Ideal  Genuine Man  In his forenote to the novel  King wrote   Don Robertson was and is one of the three writers who influenced me as a young man who was trying to  become  a novelist  the other two being Richard Matheson and John D  MacDonald    56  Robert A  Heinlein s book The Door into Summer is repeatedly mentioned in King s Wolves of the Calla  In an interview with King  Published in the USA Weekend in March 2009  the author stated   People look on writers that they like as an irreplaceable resource  I do  Elmore Leonard  every day I wake up and   not to be morbid or anything  although morbid is my life to a degree   don t see his obituary in the paper  I think to myself   Great  He s probably working somewhere  He s gonna produce another book  and I ll have another book to read   Because when he s gone  there s nobody else   57  King partly dedicated his book Cell to film director George Romero  and wrote an essay for the Elite DVD version of Night of the Living Dead  Critical response Although critical reaction to King s work has been mostly positive  he has occasionally come under fire from academic writers  Science fiction editors John Clute and Peter Nichols 58  offer a largely favorable appraisal of King  noting his  pungent prose  sharp ear for dialogue  disarmingly laid back  frank style  along with his passionately fierce denunciation of human stupidity and cruelty  especially to children   all of which rank  him among the more distinguished  popular  writers   In his analysis of post World War II horror fiction  The Modern Weird Tale  2001   critic S  T  Joshi 59  devotes a chapter to King s work  Joshi argues that King s best known works  his supernatural novels   are his worst  describing them as mostly bloated  illogical  maudlin and prone to deus ex machina endings  Despite these criticisms  Joshi argues that since Gerald s Game  1993   King has been tempering the worst of his writing faults  producing books that are leaner  more believable and generally better written  Joshi suggests that King s strengths as a writer include the accessible  everyman  quality of his prose  and his unfailingly insightful observations about the pains and joys of adolescence  Joshi cites two early non supernatural novels Rage  1977  and The Running Man  1982  as King s best  suggesting both are riveting and well constructed suspense thrillers  with believable characters  In 1996  King won an O  Henry Award for his short story  The Man in the Black Suit   In his short story collection A Century of Great Suspense Stories  editor Jeffrey Deaver noted that King  singlehandedly made popular fiction grow up  While there were many good best selling writers before him  King  more than anybody since John D  MacDonald  brought reality to genre novels  He s often remarked that  Salem s Lot was  Peyton Place meets Dracula   And so it was  The rich characterization  the careful and caring social eye  the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again  Before King  many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious blue penciled by their editors   Stuff like that gets in the way of the story   they were told  Well  it s stuff like that that has made King so popular  and helped free the popular name from the shackles of simple genre writing  He is a master of masters   60  In 2003  King was honored by the National Book Awards with a lifetime achievement award  the Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters  with his work being described thus  Stephen King s writing is securely rooted in the great American tradition that glorifies spirit of place and the abiding power of narrative  He crafts stylish  mind bending page turners that contain profound moral truths some beautiful  some harrowing about our inner lives  This Award commemorates Mr  King s well earned place of distinction in the wide world of readers and book lovers of all ages  Some in the literary community expressed disapproval of the award  Richard Snyder  the former CEO of Simon  amp  Schuster  described King s work as  non literature   and critic Harold Bloom denounced the choice  The decision to give the National Book Foundation s annual award for  distinguished contribution  to Stephen King is extraordinary  another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life  I ve described King in the past as a writer of penny dreadfuls  but perhaps even that is too kind  He shares nothing with Edgar Allan Poe  What he is is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentence by sentence  paragraph by paragraph  book by book basis  61  However  others came to King s defense  such as writer Orson Scott Card  who responded  Let me assure you that King s work most definitely is literature  because it was written to be published and is read with admiration  What Snyder really means is that it is not the literature preferred by the academic literary elite   62  In Roger Ebert s review of the 2004 movie Secret Window  he stated   A lot of people were outraged that  King  was honored at the National Book Awards  as if a popular writer could not be taken seriously  But after finding that his book On Writing had more useful and observant things to say about the craft than any book since Strunk and White s The Elements of Style  I have gotten over my own snobbery   63  In 2008  King s book On Writing was ranked 21st on Entertainment Weekly list of  The New Classics  The 100 Best Reads from 1983 to 2008   64  Appearances and adaptations in other media Main article  Media based on Stephen King works King and his wife Tabitha own Zone Radio Corp  a radio station group consisting of WZON 103 1 FM and 620 AM  65  King has stated that his favorite book to film adaptations are Stand by Me  The Shawshank Redemption  and The Mist  66  King s first film appearance was in George Romero s Knightriders as a buffoonish audience member  His first featured role was in Creepshow  playing Jordy Verrill  a backwoods redneck who  after touching a fallen meteorite in hopes of selling it  grows moss all over his body  He has since made cameos in several adaptations of his works  He appeared in Pet Sematary as a minister at a funeral  in Thinner as a pharmacist  in Rose Red as a pizza deliveryman  as a news reporter in The Storm of the Century  in The Stand as  Teddy Wieszack   in the Shining miniseries as a band member  in The Langoliers as Tom Holby and in Sleepwalkers as the cemetery caretaker  He has also appeared in The Golden Years  in Chappelle s Show and  along with fellow author Amy Tan  on The Simpsons as himself  In addition to acting  King tried his hand at directing with Maximum Overdrive  in which he also made a cameo appearance as a man using an ATM that is on the fritz  King produced and acted in a miniseries  Kingdom Hospital  which is based on the Danish miniseries Riget by Lars von Trier  He also co wrote The X Files season 5 episode  Chinga  with the creator of the series Chris Carter  King made an appearance as a contestant on Celebrity Jeopardy  in 1995  playing to benefit the Bangor Public Library  King provided the voice of Abraham Lincoln in the audiobook version of Assassination Vacation  In 2010  King appeared in a cameo role as a cleaner named Bachman  a reference to his pen name Richard Bachman  on the FX series Sons of Anarchy  67  The Syfy TV series Haven is based on King s novella  The Colorado Kid  68  Political activism In April 2008  King spoke out against HB 1423  a bill pending in the Massachusetts state legislature that would restrict or ban the sale of violent video games to anyone under the age of 18  Although King stated that he had no personal interest in video games as a hobby  he criticized the proposed law  which he sees as an attempt by politicians to scapegoat pop culture  and to act as surrogate parents to others  children  which he asserted is usually  disastrous  and  undemocratic   He also saw the law as inconsistent  as it would forbid a 17 year old  legally able to see Hostel  Part II  from buying or renting Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas  which is violent but less graphic  While conceding that he saw no artistic merit in some violent video games  King also opined that such games reflect the violence that already exists in society  which would not be lessened by such a law  and would be redundant in light of the ratings system that already exists for video games  King argued that such laws allow legislators to ignore the economic divide between the rich and poor  and the easy availability of guns  which he felt were the more legitimate causes of violence  69  A controversy emerged on May 5  2008  when a conservative blogger posted a clip of King at a Library of Congress reading event  King  talking to high school students  had said   If you can read  you can walk into a job later on  If you don t  then you ve got the Army  Iraq  I don t know  something like that   70  The comment was described by the blog as  another in a long line of liberal media members bashing the military   and likened to John Kerry s similar remark from 2006  71  King responded later that day  saying   That a right wing blog would impugn my patriotism because I said children should learn to read  and could get better jobs by doing so  is beneath contempt   I live in a national guard town  and I support our troops  but I don t support either the war or educational policies that limit the options of young men and women to any one career military or otherwise   King again defended his comment in an interview with the Bangor Daily News on May 8  saying   I m not going to apologize for promoting that kids get better education in high school  so they have more options  Those that don t agree with what I m saying  I m not going to change their minds   72  King s website states that he is a supporter of the Democratic Party  During the 2008 presidential election  King voiced his support for Democratic candidate Barack Obama  73  King was quoted as calling conservative commentator Glenn Beck  Satan s mentally challenged younger brother   74  On March 8  2011  King spoke at a political rally in Sarasota aimed against Governor Rick Scott  R FL   voicing his opposition to the Tea Party movement  75  Personal life King s home in Bangor King and his wife own and occupy three different houses  one in Bangor  one in Lovell  Maine  and they regularly winter in their waterfront mansion located off the Gulf of Mexico  in Sarasota  Florida  He and Tabitha have three children and three grandchildren  12  Shortly after publication of The Tommyknockers  King s family and friends staged an intervention  dumping evidence of his addictions taken from the trash including beer cans  cigarette butts  grams of cocaine  Xanax  Valium  NyQuil  dextromethorphan  cough medicine  and marijuana  on the rug in front of him  As King related in his memoir  he then sought help and quit all forms of drugs and alcohol in the late 1980s  and has remained sober since  15  Tabitha King has published nine of her own novels  Both King s sons are published authors  Owen King published his first collection of stories  We re All in This Together  A Novella and Stories  in 2005  Joseph Hillstrom King  who writes under the professional name Joe Hill  published a collection of short stories  20th Century Ghosts  in 2005  His debut novel  Heart Shaped Box  was published in 2007 and will be adapted into a feature film by director Neil Jordan  76  King s daughter Naomi is a Unitarian Universalist Church minister in Plantation  Florida with her same sex partner  Rev  Dr  Thandeka  77  King is a fan of baseball  and of the Boston Red Sox in particular  he frequently attends the team s home and away games  and occasionally mentions the team in his novels and stories  He helped coach his son Owen s Bangor West team to the Maine Little League Championship in 1989  He recounts this experience in the New Yorker essay  Head Down   which also appears in the collection Nightmares  amp  Dreamscapes  In 1999  King wrote The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon  which featured former Red Sox pitcher Tom Gordon as the protagonist s imaginary companion  In 2004  King co wrote a book titled Faithful  Two Diehard Boston Red Sox Fans
