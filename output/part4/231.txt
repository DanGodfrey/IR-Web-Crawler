region at the time of European contact  4 French explorer Jacques Marquette was the first European to reach the Wisconsin River and record its name  arriving in 1673 and calling the river Meskousing in his journal  5  This spelling was later corrupted to Ouisconsin by other French explorers  and over time this version became the French name for both the Wisconsin River and the surrounding lands  English speakers anglicized the spelling to its modern form when they began to arrive in greater numbers during the early 19th Century  The current spelling was made official by the legislature of Wisconsin Territory in 1845  6  Throughout the course of its many variations  the Algonquian word for Wisconsin and its original meaning have both grown obscure  Interpretations may vary  but most implicate the river and the red sandstone that line its banks  One leading theory holds that the name originated from the Miami word Meskonsing  meaning  it lies red   a reference to the setting of the Wisconsin River as it flows by the reddish sandstone of the Wisconsin Dells  7  Numerous other theories have also been widely publicized  including claims that name originated from one of a variety of Ojibwa words meaning  red stone place    gathering of the waters   or  great rock   8   edit  History Wisconsin in 1718  Guillaume de L Isle map  approximate state area highlighted  Main article  History of Wisconsin Wisconsin has been home to a wide variety of cultures over the past twelve thousand years  The first people arrived around 10000 BCE during the Wisconsin Glaciation  These early inhabitants  called Paleo Indians  hunted now extinct ice age animals exemplified by the Boaz mastodon  a prehistoric mastodon skeleton unearthed along with spear points in southwest Wisconsin  9  After the ice age ended around 8000 BCE  people in the subsequent Archaic period lived by hunting  fishing  and gathering food from wild plants  Agricultural societies emerged gradually over the Woodland period between 1000 BCE to 1000 CE  Toward the end of this period  Wisconsin was the heartland of the  Effigy Mound culture   which built thousands of animal shaped mounds across the landscape  10  Later  between 1000 and 1500 CE  the Mississippian and Oneota cultures built substantial settlements including the fortified village at Aztalan in southeast Wisconsin  11  The Oneota may be the ancestors of the modern Ioway and Ho Chunk tribes  who shared the Wisconsin region with the Menominee at the time of European contact  12  Other American Indian groups living in Wisconsin when Europeans first settled included the Ojibwa  Sauk  Fox  Kickapoo  and Pottawatomie  who migrated to Wisconsin from the east between 1500 and 1700  13  Jean Nicolet  depicted in a 1910 painting by Frank Rohrbeck  was probably the first European to explore Wisconsin  The mural is located in the Brown County Courthouse in Green Bay  The first European to visit what became Wisconsin was probably the French explorer Jean Nicolet  He canoed west from Georgian Bay through the Great Lakes in 1634  and it is traditionally assumed that he came ashore near Green Bay at Red Banks  14 Pierre Radisson and M dard des Groseilliers visited Green Bay again in 1654 1666 and Chequamegon Bay in 1659 1660  where they traded for fur with local American Indians  15  In 1673  Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet became the first to record a journey on the Fox Wisconsin Waterway all the way to the Mississippi River near Prairie du Chien  16  Frenchmen like Nicholas Perrot continued to ply the fur trade across Wisconsin through the 17th and 18th centuries  but the French made no permanent settlements in Wisconsin before Great Britain won control of the region following the French and Indian War in 1763  Even so  French traders continued to work in the region after the war  and some  beginning with Charles de Langlade in 1764  now settled in Wisconsin permanently rather than returning to British controlled Canada  17  Wisconsin became a territorial possession of the United States in 1783 after the American Revolutionary War  However  the British remained in de facto control until after the War of 1812  which finally established an American presence in the area  18  Under American control  the economy of the territory shifted from fur trading to lead mining  The prospect of easy mineral wealth drew immigrants from throughout the U S  and Europe to the lead deposits located at Mineral Point  Wisconsin and nearby areas  Some miners found shelter in the holes they had dug and earned the nickname  badgers   leading to Wisconsin s identity as the  Badger State   19  The sudden influx of white miners prompted tension with the local Native American population  The Winnebago War of 1827 and the Black Hawk War of 1832 led to the forced removal of American Indians from most parts of the state  20  Following these conflicts  Wisconsin Territory was organized in 1836  Continued white settlement led to statehood in 1848  The Little White Schoolhouse in Ripon  Wisconsin held the nation s first meeting of the Republican Party Politics in early Wisconsin were defined by the greater national debate over slavery  A free state from its foundation  Wisconsin became a center of northern abolitionism  The debate became especially intense in 1854 after a runaway slave from Missouri named Joshua Glover was captured in Racine  Glover was taken into custody under the Federal Fugitive Slave Law  but a mob of abolitionists stormed the prison where Glover was held and helped him escape to Canada  The Wisconsin Supreme Court ultimately declared the Fugitive Slave Law unconstitutional in a trial stemming from the incident  21  The Republican Party  founded on March 20  1854  by anti slavery expansion activists in Ripon  Wisconsin  grew to dominate state politics in the aftermath of these events  22  During the Civil War  around 91 000 troops from Wisconsin fought for the Union  23  Drawing of Industrial Milwaukee in 1882 Wisconsin s economy also diversified during the early years of statehood  While lead mining diminished  agriculture became a principal occupation in the southern half of the state  Railroads were built across the state to help transport grains to market  and industries like J I  Case  amp  Company in Racine were founded to build agricultural equipment  Wisconsin briefly became one of the nation s leading producers of wheat during the 1860s  24  Meanwhile  the lumber industry dominated in the heavily forested northern sections of Wisconsin  and sawmills sprang up in cities like La Crosse  Eau Claire  and Wausau  These economic activities had dire environmental consequences  By the close of the 19th century  intensive agriculture had devastated soil fertility  and lumbering had deforested most of the state  25  This forced both wheat agriculture and the lumber industry into a precipitous decline  The Daniel E  Krause Stone Barn in Chase  Wisconsin was built in 1903 as dairy farming spread across the state Beginning in the 1890s  farmers in Wisconsin shifted from wheat to dairy production in order to make more sustainable and profitable use of their land  Many immigrants carried cheese making traditions that  combined with the state s suitable geography and dairy research led by Stephen Babcock at the University of Wisconsin  helped the state build a reputation as  America s Dairyland   26  Meanwhile  conservationists including Aldo Leopold helped reestablish the state s forests during the early 20th century  27  paving the way for a more renewable lumber and paper milling industry as well as promoting recreational tourism in the northern woodlands  Manufacturing also boomed in Wisconsin during the early 20th century  driven by an immense immigrant workforce arriving from Europe  Industries in cities like Milwaukee ranged from brewing and food processing to heavy machine production and toolmaking  leading Wisconsin to rank 8th among U S  states in total product value by 1910  28  Wisconsin Governor Robert La Follette addressing an assembly in Decatur  Illinois  1905  The early 20th century was also notable for the emergence of progressive politics championed by Robert M  La Follette  Between 1901 and 1914  Progressive Republicans in Wisconsin created the nation s first comprehensive statewide primary election system  29  the first effective workplace injury compensation law  30  and the first state income tax  31  making taxation proportional to actual earnings  The progressive Wisconsin Idea also promoted the statewide expansion of the University of Wisconsin through the UW Extension system at this time  32  Later  UW economics professors John R  Commons and Harold Groves helped Wisconsin create the first unemployment compensation program in the United States in 1932  33  Wisconsin took part in several political extremes in the mid to late 20th century  ranging from the anti communist crusades of Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s to the radical antiwar protests at UW Madison that culminated in the Sterling Hall bombing in August 1970  Recent politics have been comparatively moderate  but the state has continued to push forward new ideas  most notably becoming a leader in welfare reform under Republican Governor Tommy Thompson during the 1990s  34  The state s economy also underwent further transformations towards the close of the century  as heavy industry and manufacturing declined in favor of a service economy based on medicine  education  agribusiness  and tourism  Two U S  Navy battleships  BB 9 and BB 64  were named USS Wisconsin in honor of this state   edit  State Symbols State Motto  Forward State Song  On Wisconsin  State Flower  Wood Violet

bluffs carved in sedimentary rock by water from melting Ice Age glaciers  Wisconsin is bordered by the Montreal River  Lake Superior and Michigan to the north  by Lake Michigan to the east  by Illinois to the south  and by Iowa to the southwest and Minnesota to the northwest  A border dispute with Michigan was settled by two cases  both Wisconsin v  Michigan  in 1934 and 1935  The state s boundaries include the Mississippi River and St  Croix River in the west  and the Menominee River in the northeast  Wisconsin is the northernmost state that does not share a border with Canada  citation needed  With its location between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River  Wisconsin is home to a wide variety of geographical features  The state is divided into five distinct regions  In the north  the Lake Superior Lowland occupies a belt of land along Lake Superior  Just to the south  the Northern Highland has massive mixed hardwood and coniferous forests including the 1 500 000 acres  6 100 km2  Chequamegon Nicolet National Forest  as well as thousands of glacial lakes  and the state s highest point  Timms Hill  In the middle of the state  the Central Plain has some unique sandstone formations like the Dells of the Wisconsin River in addition to rich farmland  The Eastern Ridges and Lowlands region in the southeast is home to many of Wisconsin s largest cities  The ridges include the Niagara Escarpment that stretches from New York State  the Black River Escarpment and the Magnesian Escarpment  36  37  The bedrock of the Niagara Escarpment is dolomite  while the two shorter ridges have limestone bedrock  In the southwest  the Western Upland is a rugged landscape with a mix of forest and farmland  including many bluffs on the Mississippi River  This region is part of the Driftless Area  which also includes portions of Iowa  Illinois  and Minnesota  This area was not covered by glaciers during the most recent ice age  the Wisconsin Glaciation  Overall  46

0 44  increase since the 2010 United States Census  1  Since its founding  Wisconsin has been ethnically heterogeneous  Following the period of French fur traders  the next wave of settlers were miners  many of whom were Cornish  who settled the southwestern area of the state  The next wave was dominated by  Yankees   migrants of English descent from New England and upstate New York  in the early years of statehood  they dominated the state s heavy industry  finance  politics and education  Between 1850 and 1900  large numbers of European immigrants followed them  including Germans  Scandinavians  the largest group being Norwegian   and smaller groups of Belgians  Dutch  Swiss  Finns  Irish  Poles  and others  In the 20th century  large numbers of Mexicans and African Americans came  settling mainly in Milwaukee  and after end of the Vietnam War came an influx of Hmongs  The six largest ancestry groups in Wisconsin are  German  42 6    Irish  10 9    Polish  9 3    Norwegian

residents of Polish ancestry of any state  41  The various ethnic groups settled in different areas of the state  Although Germans settled throughout the state  the largest concentration was in Milwaukee  Norwegians settled in lumbering and farming areas in the north and west  Small colonies of Belgians  Swiss  Finns and other groups settled in their particular areas  with Irish  Italian  and Polish immigrants settling primarily in urban areas  43 African Americans came to Milwaukee  especially from 1940 on  Menominee County is the only county in the eastern United States with an

legislative branch  The Legislature is a bicameral body consisting of the Assembly and the Senate   edit  Judicial Wisconsin s court system has four levels  municipal courts  circuit courts  the Court of Appeals  and the Supreme Court  Municipal courts typically handle cases involving local ordinance matters  The circuit courts are Wisconsin s trial courts  they have original jurisdiction in all civil and criminal cases within the state  Challenges to circuit court rulings are heard by the Wisconsin Court of Appeals  consisting of sixteen judges who typically sit in three judge panels  As the state s highest appellate court  the Wisconsin Supreme Court may hear both appeals from lower courts and original actions  In addition to deciding cases  the Supreme Court is responsible for administering the state s court system and regulating the practice of law in Wisconsin  51   edit  Federal In the United State Senate Wisconsin is represented by Ron Johnson and Herb Kohl  Wisconsin is divided into eight congressional districts   edit  Taxes Wisconsin collects personal income taxes  based on five income brackets  which range from 4 6  to 7 75   The state sales and use tax rate is 5 0   Fifty nine counties have an additional sales use tax of 0 5   52 Milwaukee County and four surrounding counties have an additional temporary 0 1  tax which helps fund the Miller Park baseball stadium  which was completed in 2001  Retailers who make sales subject to applicable county taxes must collect this tax on their retail sales  The most common property tax assessed on Wisconsin residents is the real property tax  or their residential property tax  Wisconsin does not impose a property tax on vehicles  but does levy an annual registration fee  Property taxes are the most important tax revenue source for Wisconsin s local governments  as well as major methods of funding school districts  vocational technical colleges  special purpose districts and tax incremental finance districts  Equalized values are based on the full market value of all taxable property in the state  except for agricultural land  In order to provide property tax relief for farmers  the value of agricultural land is determined by its value for agricultural uses  rather than for its possible development value  Equalized values are used to distribute state aid payments to counties  municipalities  and technical colleges  Assessments prepared by local assessors are used to distribute the property tax burden within individual municipalities  Wisconsin does not assess a tax on intangible property  Wisconsin does not collect inheritance taxes  Until January 1  2008  Wisconsin s estate tax was decoupled from the federal estate tax laws  therefore the state imposed its own estate tax on certain large estates  53  There are no toll roads in Wisconsin  highway construction and maintenance are funded in part by motor fuel tax revenues  and the remaining balance is drawn from the State General Fund  Non highway road construction and maintenance are funded by local governments  municipalities or counties    edit  Politics Presidential elections results Year Republican

religious issues in the late 19th century caused a brief split in the Republican coalition  Through the first half of the 20th century  Wisconsin s politics were dominated by Robert La Follette and his sons  originally of the Republican Party  but later of the revived Progressive Party  Since 1945  the state has maintained a close balance between Republicans and Democrats  Republican Senator Joe McCarthy was a controversial national figure in the early 1950s  Recent leading Republicans include former Governor Tommy Thompson and Congressman F  James Sensenbrenner  Jr   prominent Democrats include Senators Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold  and Congressman David Obey  54  The most famous controversy in the state s political history dealt with foreign language teaching in schools  This was fought out in the Bennett Law campaign of 1890  when the Germans switched to the Democratic Party because of the Republican Party s support of the Bennett Law  which led to a major victory for the Democrats  citation needed  The cities of Wisconsin have been active in increasing the availability of legislative information on the internet  thereby providing for greater government transparency  Currently three of the five most populous cities in Wisconsin provide their constituents with internet based access of all public records directly from the cities  databases  Wisconsin cities started to make this a priority after Milwaukee began doing so  on their page  in 2001  One such city  Madison  has been named the Number 1 digital city by the Center for Digital Government in consecutive years  citation needed  In the 2008 presidential election  Wisconsin voted for the Democratic presidential nominee  Illinois Senator Barack Obama  Obama captured 56  of the vote statewide  with the urban centers of Milwaukee and Madison voting strongly Democratic  Bucking the historic trend  Brown County  home to Green Bay  and Outagamie County  home to Appleton  voted for Obama over John McCain  the Republican presidential nominee  In all  McCain captured approximately 42  of the vote statewide and won 13 of the state s 72 counties  Of the counties won by McCain  only a handful were by greater than 55  of the vote  Florence  Green Lake  Ozaukee  Washington  and Waukesha  with Washington County providing his largest single county percentage victory in the state   In all  Obama was successful in 59 counties  transcending the state s usual east west and urban suburban rural divides  Wisconsin ranked second in voter turnout in the 2008 presidential election  behind Minnesota  In 2008 under Democratic rule  Milwaukee became the third U S  city to pass paid sick days legislation  citation needed  The 2010 elections  however  saw a huge Republican resurgence in Wisconsin  Republicans took control of the governor s office and both houses of the state legislature  Republican Ron Johnson defeated Democratic incumbent U S  Senator Russ Feingold  and Republicans took two
