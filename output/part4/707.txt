Sound film From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search 1902 poster advertising Gaumont s sound films  depicting an optimistically vast auditorium A sound film is a motion picture with synchronized sound  or sound technologically coupled to image  as opposed to a silent film  The first known public exhibition of projected sound films took place in Paris in 1900  but decades would pass before sound motion pictures were made commercially practical  Reliable synchronization was difficult to achieve with the early sound on disc systems  and amplification and recording quality were also inadequate  Innovations in sound on film led to the first commercial screening of short motion pictures using the technology  which took place in New York City in April 1923  The primary steps in the commercialization of sound cinema were taken in the United States in the mid  to late 1920s  At first  the sound films incorporating synchronized dialogue known as  talking pictures   or  talkies  were exclusively shorts  the earliest feature length movies with recorded sound included only music and effects  The first feature film originally presented as a talkie was The Jazz Singer  released in October 1927  A major hit  it was made with Vitaphone  the leading brand of sound on disc technology  Sound on film  however  would soon become the standard for talking pictures  By the early 1930s  the talkies were a global phenomenon  In the United States  they helped secure Hollywood s position as one of the world s most powerful cultural commercial systems  see Cinema of the United States   In Europe  and  to a lesser degree  elsewhere  the new development was treated with suspicion by many filmmakers and critics  who worried that a focus on dialogue would subvert the unique aesthetic virtues of soundless cinema  In Japan  where the popular film tradition integrated silent movie and live vocal performance  talking pictures were slow to take root  In India  sound was the transformative element that led to the rapid expansion of the nation s film industry the most productive such industry in the world since the early 1960s  Contents 1 History 1 1

Dickson Experimental Sound Film  1894 or 1895   produced by W K L  Dickson as a test of the early version of the Edison Kinetophone  combining the Kinetoscope and phonograph  The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as the concept of cinema itself  On February 27  1888  a couple of days after photographic pioneer Eadweard Muybridge gave a lecture not far from the laboratory of Thomas Edison  the two inventors privately met  Muybridge later claimed that on this occasion  six years before the first commercial motion picture exhibition  he proposed a scheme for sound cinema that would combine his image casting zoopraxiscope with Edison s recorded sound technology  1  No agreement was reached  but within a year Edison commissioned the development of the Kinetoscope  essentially a  peep show  system  as a visual complement to his cylinder phonograph  The two devices were brought together as the Kinetophone in 1895  but individual  cabinet viewing of motion pictures was soon to be outmoded by successes in film projection  2  In 1899  a projected sound film system known as Cinemacrophonograph or Phonorama  based primarily on the work of Swiss born inventor Fran ois Dussaud  was exhibited in Paris  similar to the Kinetophone  the system required individual use of earphones  3  An improved cylinder based system  Phono Cin ma Th  tre  was developed by Cl ment Maurice Gratioulet and Henri Lioret of France  allowing short films of theater  opera  and ballet excerpts to be presented at the Paris Exposition in 1900  These appear to be the first publicly exhibited films with projection of both image and recorded sound  Phonorama and yet another sound film system Th  troscope were also presented at the Exposition  4  Three major problems persisted  leading to motion pictures and sound recording largely taking separate paths for a generation  The primary issue was synchronization  pictures and sound were recorded and played back by separate devices  which were difficult to start and maintain in tandem  5  Sufficient playback volume was also hard to achieve  While motion picture projectors soon allowed film to be shown to large theater audiences  audio technology before the development of electric amplification could not project to satisfactorily fill large spaces  Finally  there was the challenge of recording fidelity  The primitive systems of the era produced sound of very low quality unless the performers were stationed directly in front of the cumbersome recording devices  acoustical horns  for the most part   imposing severe limits on the sort of films that could be created with live recorded sound  6  Poster featuring Sarah Bernhardt and giving the names of eighteen other  famous artists  shown in  living visions  at the 1900 Paris Exposition using the Gratioulet Lioret system  Cinematic innovators attempted to cope with the fundamental synchronization problem in a variety of ways  An increasing number of motion picture systems relied on gramophone records known as sound on disc technology  the records themselves were often referred to as  Berliner discs   after one of the primary inventors in the field  German American Emile Berliner  In 1902  L on Gaumont demonstrated his sound on disc Chronophone  involving an electrical connection he had recently patented  to the French Photographic Society  7  Four years later  Gaumont introduced the Elg phone  a compressed air amplification system based on the Auxetophone  developed by British inventors Horace Short and Charles Parsons  8  Despite high expectations  Gaumont s sound innovations had only limited commercial success though improvements  they still did not satisfactorily address the three basic issues with sound film and were expensive as well  For some years  American inventor E  E  Norton s Cameraphone was the primary competitor to the Gaumont system  sources differ on whether the Cameraphone was disc  or cylinder based   it ultimately failed for many of the same reasons that held back the Chronophone  9  In 1913  Edison introduced a new cylinder based synch sound apparatus known  just like his 1895 system  as the Kinetophone  instead of films being shown to individual viewers in the Kinetoscope cabinet  they were now projected onto a screen  The phonograph was connected by an intricate arrangement of pulleys to the film projector  allowing under ideal conditions for synchronization  Conditions  however  were rarely ideal  and the new  improved Kinetophone was retired after little more than a year  10  By the mid 1910s  the groundswell in commercial sound motion picture exhibition had subsided  9  Beginning in 1914  The Photo Drama of Creation  promoting Jehovah s Witnesses  conception of mankind s genesis  was screened around the United States  eight hours worth of projected visuals involving both slides and live action were synchronized with separately recorded lectures and musical performances played back on phonograph  11  Meanwhile  innovations continued on another significant front  In 1907  French born  London based Eugene Lauste who had worked at Edison s lab between 1886 and 1892 was awarded the first patent for sound on film technology  involving the transformation of sound into light waves that are photographically recorded direct onto celluloid  As described by historian Scott Eyman  It was a double system  that is  the sound was on a different piece of film from the picture     In essence  the sound was captured by a microphone and translated into light waves via a light valve  a thin ribbon of sensitive metal over a tiny slit  The sound reaching this ribbon would be converted into light by the shivering of the diaphragm  focusing the resulting light waves through the slit  where it would be photographed on the side of the film  on a strip about a tenth of an inch wide  12  Though sound on film would eventually become the universal standard for synchronized sound cinema  Lauste never successfully exploited his innovations  which came to an effective dead end  In 1914  Finnish inventor Eric Tigerstedt was granted German patent 309 536 for his sound on film work  that same year  he apparently demonstrated a film made with the process to an audience of scientists in Berlin  13  Hungarian engineer Denes Mihaly submitted his sound on film Projectofon concept to the Royal Hungarian Patent Court in 1918  the patent award was published four years later  14  Whether sound was captured on cylinder  disc  or film  none of the available technology was adequate to big league commercial purposes  and for many years the heads of the major Hollywood film studios saw little benefit in producing sound motion pictures  15   edit  Crucial innovations A number of technological developments contributed to making sound cinema commercially viable by the late 1920s  Two involved contrasting approaches to synchronized sound reproduction  or playback  Advanced sound on film   In 1919  American inventor Lee De Forest was awarded several patents that would lead to the first sound on film technology with commercial application  In De Forest s system  the sound track was photographically recorded on to the side of the strip of motion picture film to create a composite  or  married   print  If proper synchronization of sound and picture was achieved in recording  it could be absolutely counted on in playback  Over the next four years  he improved his system with the help of equipment and patents licensed from another American inventor in the field  Theodore Case  16  At the University of Illinois  Polish born research engineer Joseph Tykoci ski Tykociner was working independently on a similar process  On June 9  1922  he gave the first reported U S  demonstration of a sound on film motion picture to members of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers  17  As with Lauste and Tigerstedt  Tykociner s system would never be taken advantage of commercially  De Forest s  however  soon would  Newspaper ad for a 1925 presentation of De Forest Phonofilms shorts  touting their technological distinction  no phonograph  On April 15  1923  at New York City s Rivoli Theater  came the first commercial screening of motion pictures with sound on film  the future standard  a set of shorts under the banner of De Forest Phonofilms  accompanying a silent feature  18  That June  De Forest entered into an extended legal battle with an employee  Freeman Harrison Owens  for title to one of the crucial Phonofilm patents  Although De Forest ultimately won the case in the courts  Owens is today recognized as a central innovator in the field  19  The following year  De Forest s studio released the first commercial dramatic film shot as a talking picture the two reeler Love s Old Sweet Song  directed by J  Searle Dawley and featuring Una Merkel  20  Phonofilm s stock in trade  however  was not original dramas but celebrity documentaries  popular music acts  and comedy performances  President Calvin Coolidge  opera singer Abbie Mitchell  and vaudeville stars such as Phil Baker  Ben Bernie  Eddie Cantor  and Oscar Levant appeared in the firm s pictures  Hollywood remained suspicious  even fearful  of the new technology  As Photoplay editor James Quirk put it in March 1924   Talking pictures are perfected  says Dr  Lee De Forest  So is castor oil   21  De Forest s process continued to be used through 1927 in the United States for dozens of short Phonofilms  in the UK it was employed a few years longer for both shorts and features by British Sound Film Productions  a subsidiary of British Talking Pictures  which purchased the primary Phonofilm assets  By the end of 1930  the Phonofilm business would be liquidated  22  In Europe  others were also working on the development of sound on film  In 1919  the same year that DeForest received his first patents in the field  three German inventors patented the Tri Ergon sound system  On September 17  1922  the Tri Ergon group gave a public screening of sound on film productions including a dramatic talkie  Der Brandstifter  The Arsonist   before an invited audience at the Alhambra Kino in Berlin  23  By the end of the decade  Tri Ergon would be the dominant European sound system  In 1923  two Danish engineers  Axel Petersen and Arnold Poulsen  patented a system in which sound was recorded on a separate filmstrip running parallel with the image reel  Gaumont would license and briefly put the technology to commercial use under the name Cin phone  24  It was domestic competition  however  that led to Phonofilm s eclipse  By September 1925  De Forest and Case s working arrangement had fallen through  The following July  Case joined with Fox Film  Hollywood s third largest studio  to found the Fox Case Corporation  The system developed by Case and his assistant  Earl Sponable  given the name Movietone  thus became the first viable sound on film technology controlled by a Hollywood movie studio  The following year  Fox purchased the North American rights to the Tri Ergon system  though the company found it inferior to Movietone and virtually impossible to integrate the two different systems to advantage  25  In 1927  as well  Fox retained the services of Freeman Owens  who had particular expertise in constructing cameras for synch sound film  26  Advanced sound on disc   Parallel with improvements in sound on film technology  a number of companies were making progress with systems in which movie sound was recorded onto phonograph discs  In sound on disc technology from the era  a phonograph turntable is connected by a mechanical interlock to a specially modified film projector  allowing for synchronization  In 1921  the Photokinema sound on disc system developed by Orlando Kellum was employed to add synchronized sound sequences to D  W  Griffith s failed silent film Dream Street  A love song  performed by star Ralph Graves  was recorded  as was a sequence of live vocal effects  Apparently  dialogue scenes were also recorded  but the results were unsatisfactory and the film was never publicly screened incorporating them  On May 1  1921  Dream Street was re released  with love song added  at New York City s Town Hall theater  qualifying it however haphazardly as the first feature length film with a live recorded vocal sequence  27  There would be no others for more than six years  Poster for Warner Bros   Don Juan  1926   the first major motion picture to premiere with a full length synchronized soundtrack  Audio recording engineer George Groves  the first in Hollywood to hold the job  would supervise sound on Woodstock  44 years later  In 1925  Warner Bros   then a small Hollywood studio with big ambitions  began experimenting with sound on disc systems at New York s Vitagraph Studios  which it had recently purchased  The Warner Bros  technology  named Vitaphone  was publicly introduced on August 6  1926  with the premiere of the nearly three hour long Don Juan  the first feature length movie to employ a synchronized sound system of any type throughout  its soundtrack contained a musical score and sound effects  but no recorded dialogue in other words  it had been staged and shot as a silent film  Accompanying Don Juan  however  were eight shorts of musical performances  mostly classical  as well as a four minute filmed introduction by Will H  Hays  president of the Motion Picture Association of America  all with live recorded sound  These were the first true sound films exhibited by a Hollywood studio  28  Warner Bros   The Better  Ole  technically similar to Don Juan  followed in October  29  Sound on film would ultimately win out over sound on disc because of a number of fundamental technical advantages  Synchronization  no interlock system was completely reliable  and sound could fall out of synch due to disc skipping or minute changes in film speed  requiring constant supervision and frequent manual adjustment Editing  discs could not be directly edited  severely limiting the ability to make alterations in their accompanying films after the original release cut Distribution  phonograph discs added expense and complication to film distribution Wear and tear  the physical process of playing the discs degraded them  requiring their replacement after approximately twenty screenings 30  Nonetheless  in the early years  sound on disc had the edge over sound on film in two substantial ways  Production and capital cost  it was generally less expensive to record sound onto disc than onto film and the exhibition systems turntable interlock projector were cheaper to manufacture than the complex image and audio pattern reading projectors required by sound on film Audio quality  phonograph discs  Vitaphone s in particular  had superior dynamic range to most sound on film processes of the day  at least during the first few playings  while sound on film tended to have better frequency response  this was outweighed by greater distortion and noise 31  32  As sound on film technology improved  both of these disadvantages were overcome  The third crucial set of innovations marked a major step forward in both the live recording of sound and its effective playback  Western Electric engineer E  B  Craft  at left  demonstrating the Vitaphone projection system  A Vitaphone disc had a running time of about 11 minutes  enough to match that of a 1 000 foot reel of 35mm film  Fidelity electronic recording and amplification   Beginning in 1922  the research branch of AT amp T s Western Electric manufacturing division began working intensively on recording technology for both sound on disc and sound on film  In 1925  the company publicly introduced a greatly improved system of electronic audio  including sensitive condenser microphones and rubber line recorders  That May  the company licensed entrepreneur Walter J  Rich to exploit the system for commercial motion pictures  he founded Vitagraph  which Warner Bros  acquired a half interest in just one month later  33  In April 1926  Warners signed a contract with AT amp T for exclusive use of its film sound technology for the redubbed Vitaphone operation  leading to the production of Don Juan and its accompanying shorts over the following months  34  During the period when Vitaphone had exclusive access to the patents  the fidelity of recordings made for Warners films was markedly superior to those made for the company s sound on film competitors  Meanwhile  Bell Labs the new name for the AT amp T research operation was working at a furious pace on sophisticated sound amplification technology that would allow recordings to be played back over loudspeakers at theater filling volume  The new moving coil speaker system was installed in New York s Warners Theatre at the end of July and its patent submission  for what Western Electric called the No  555 Receiver  was filed on August 4  just two days before the premiere of Don Juan  32  35  Late in the year  AT amp T Western Electric created a licensing division  Electrical Research Products Inc   ERPI   to handle rights to the company s film related audio technology  Vitaphone still had legal exclusivity  but having lapsed in its royalty payments  effective control of the rights was in ERPI s hands  On December 31  1926  Warners granted Fox Case a sublicense for the use of the Western Electric system  in exchange for the sublicense  both Warners and ERPI received a share of Fox s related revenues  The patents of all three concerns were cross licensed  36  Superior recording and amplification technology was now available to two Hollywood studios  pursuing two very different methods of sound reproduction  The new year would finally see the emergence of sound cinema as a significant commercial medium   edit  Triumph of the  talkies  In February 1927  an agreement was signed by five leading Hollywood movie companies  the so called Big Two Paramount and MGM a pair of studios in the next rank Universal and the fading First National and Cecil B  DeMille s small but prestigious Producers Distributing Corporation  PDC   The five studios agreed to collectively select just one provider for sound conversion  The alliance then sat back and waited to see what sort of results the forerunners came up with  37  In May  Warner Bros  sold back its exclusivity rights to ERPI  along with the Fox Case sublicense  and signed a new royalty contract similar to Fox s for use of Western Electric technology  As Fox and Warners pressed forward with sound cinema in different directions  both technologically and commercially Fox with newsreels and then scored dramas  Warners with talking features so did ERPI  which sought to corner the market by signing up the five allied studios  38  Newspaper ad from a fully equipped theater in Tacoma  Washington  showing The Jazz Singer  on Vitaphone  and a Fox newsreel  on Movietone  together on the same bill  The big sound film sensations of the year all took advantage of pre existing celebrity  On May 20  1927  at New York s Roxy Theater  Fox Movietone presented a sound film of the takeoff of Charles Lindbergh s celebrated flight to Paris  recorded earlier that day  In June  a Fox sound newsreel depicting his return welcomes in New York and Washington  D C   was shown  These were the two most acclaimed sound motion pictures to date  39  In May  as well  Fox had released the first Hollywood fiction film with synchronized dialogue  the short They re Coming to Get Me  starring comedian Chic Sale  40  After rereleasing a few silent feature hits  such as Seventh Heaven  with recorded music  Fox came out with its first original Movietone feature on September 23  Sunrise  by acclaimed German director F  W  Murnau  As with Don Juan  the film s soundtrack consisted of a musical score and sound effects  including  in a couple of crowd scenes   wild   nonspecific vocals   41  Then  on October 6  1927  Warner Bros   The Jazz Singer premiered  It was a smash box office success for the mid level studio  earning a total of  2 625 million in the U S  and abroad  almost a million dollars more than the previous record for a Warners  film  42  Produced with the Vitaphone system  most of the film does not contain live recorded audio  relying  like Sunrise and Don Juan  on a score and effects  When the movie s star  Al Jolson  sings  however  the film shifts to sound recorded on the set  including both his musical performances and two scenes with ad libbed speech one of Jolson s character  Jakie Rabinowitz  Jack Robin   addressing a cabaret audience  the other an exchange between him and his mother  The  natural  sounds of the settings were also audible  43  Though the success of The Jazz Singer was due largely to Jolson  already established as one of America s biggest music stars  and its limited use of synchronized sound hardly qualified it as an innovative sound film  let alone the  first    the movie s profits were proof enough to the industry that the technology was worth investing in  44  The development of commercial sound cinema had proceeded in fits and starts before The Jazz Singer  and the film s success did not change things overnight  Not until May 1928 did the group of four big studios  PDC had dropped out of the alliance   along with United Artists and others  sign with ERPI for conversion of production facilities and theaters for sound film  Initially  all ERPI wired theaters were made Vitaphone compatible  most were equipped to project Movietone reels as well  45  Even with access to both technologies  however  most of the Hollywood companies remained slow to produce talking features of their own  No studio beside Warner Bros  released even a part talking feature until the low budget oriented Film Booking Offices of America  FBO  premiered The Perfect Crime on June 17  1928  eight months after The Jazz Singer  46  FBO had come under the effective control of a Western Electric competitor  General Electric s RCA division  which was looking to market its new sound on film system  Photophone  Unlike Fox Case s Movietone and De Forest s Phonofilm  which were variable density systems  Photophone was a variable area system a refinement in the way the audio signal was inscribed on film that would ultimately become the rule   In both sorts of system  a specially designed lamp  whose exposure to the film is determined by the audio input  is used to record sound photographically as a series of minuscule lines  In a variable density process  the lines are of varying darkness  in a variable area process  the lines are of varying width   By October  the FBO RCA alliance would lead to the creation of Hollywood s newest major studio  RKO Pictures  Dorothy Mackaill and Milton Sills in The Barker  First National s inaugural talkie  The film was released in December 1928  two months after Warner Bros  acquired a controlling interest in the studio  Meanwhile  Warner Bros  had released three more talkies  all profitable  if not at the level of The Jazz Singer  In March  The Tenderloin appeared  it was billed by Warners as the first feature in which characters spoke their parts  though only 15 of its 88 minutes had dialogue  Glorious Betsy followed in April  and The Lion and the Mouse  31 minutes of dialogue  in May  47  On July 6  1928  the first all talking feature  Lights of New York  premiered  The film cost Warner Bros  only  23 000 to produce  but grossed  1 252 million  a record rate of return surpassing 5 000   In September  the studio released another Al Jolson part talking picture  The Singing Fool  which more than doubled The Jazz Singer s earnings record for a Warners movie  48  This second Jolson screen smash demonstrated the movie musical s ability to turn a song into a national hit  inside of nine months  the Jolson number  Sonny Boy  had racked up 2 million record and 1 25 million sheet music sales  49  September 1928 also saw the release of Paul Terry s Dinner Time  among the first animated cartoons produced with synchronized sound  Soon after he saw it  Walt Disney released his first sound picture  the Mickey Mouse short Steamboat Willie  50  Over the course of 1928  as Warner Bros  began to rake in huge profits due to the popularity of its sound films  the other studios quickened the pace of their conversion to the new technology  Paramount  the industry leader  put out its first talkie in late September  Beggars of Life  though it had just a few lines of dialogue  it demonstrated the studio s recognition of the new medium s power  Interference  Paramount s first all talker  debuted in November  51  The process known as  goat glanding  briefly became widespread  soundtracks  sometimes including a smatter of post dubbed dialogue or song  were added to movies that had been shot  and in some cases released  as silents  52  A few minutes of singing could qualify such a newly endowed film as a  musical    Griffith s Dream Street had essentially been a  goat gland    Expectations swiftly changed  and the sound  fad  of 1927 became standard procedure by 1929  In February 1929  sixteen months after The Jazz Singer s debut  Columbia Pictures became the last of the eight studios that would be known as  majors  during Hollywood s Golden Age to release its first part talking feature  Lone Wolf s Daughter  53  In late May  the first all color  all talking feature  Warner Bros   On with the Show   premiered  54  Yet most American movie theaters  especially outside of urban areas  were still not equipped for sound  while the number of sound cinemas grew from 100 to 800 between 1928 and 1929  they were still vastly outnumbered by silent theaters  which had actually grown in number as well  from 22 204 to 22 544  55  The studios  in parallel  were still not entirely convinced of the talkies  universal appeal through mid 1930  the majority of Hollywood movies were produced in dual versions  silent as well as talking  56  Though few in the industry predicted it  silent film as a viable commercial medium in the United States would soon be little more than a memory  Points West  a Hoot Gibson Western released by Universal Pictures in August 1929  was the last purely silent mainstream feature put out by a major Hollywood studio  57   edit  Transition  Europe Marlene Dietrich in Ich k sse Ihre Hand  Madame  1929   Dietrich did not sing in the film  but did so the following year in Der Blaue Engel  which made her an international star  The Jazz Singer had its European sound premiere at the Piccadilly Theatre in London on September 27  1928  58  According to film historian Rachael Low   Many in the industry realized at once that a change to sound production was inevitable   59  On January 16  1929  the first European feature film with a synchronized vocal performance and recorded score premiered  the German production Ich k sse Ihre Hand  Madame  I Kiss Your Hand  Madame   Dialogueless  it contains only a few songs performed by Richard Tauber  60  The movie was made with the sound on film system controlled by the German Dutch firm Tobis  corporate heirs to the Tri Ergon concern  With an eye toward commanding the emerging European market for sound film  Tobis entered into a compact with its chief competitor  Klangfilm  a joint subsidiary of Germany s two leading electrical manufacturers  Early in 1929  Tobis and Klangfilm began comarketing their recording and playback technologies  As ERPI began to wire theaters around Europe  Tobis Klangfilm claimed that the Western Electric system infringed on the Tri Ergon patents  stalling the introduction of American technology in many places  61  Just as RCA had entered the movie business to maximize its recording system s value  Tobis also established its own production operations  62  During 1929  most of the major European filmmaking countries began joining Hollywood in the changeover to sound  Many of the trend setting European talkies were shot abroad as production companies leased studios while their own were being converted or as they deliberately targeted markets speaking different languages  One of Europe s first two feature length dramatic talkies was created in still a different sort of twist on multinational moviemaking  The Crimson Circle was a coproduction between director Friedrich Zelnik s Efzet Film company and British Sound Film Productions  BSFP   In 1928  the film had been released as the silent Der Rote Kreis in Germany  where it was shot  English dialogue was apparently dubbed in much later using the De Forest Phonofilm process controlled by BSFP s corporate parent  It was given a British trade screening in March 1929  as was a part talking film made entirely in the UK  The Clue of the New Pin  a British Lion production using the sound on disc British Photophone system  In May  Black Waters  a British and Dominions Film Corporation promoted as the first UK all talker  received its initial trade screening  it had been shot completely in Hollywood with a Western Electric sound on film system  None of these pictures made much impact  63  The Prague raised star of Blackmail  1929   Anny Ondra  was an industry favorite  but her thick accent became an issue when the film was reshot with sound  Without post dubbing capacity  her dialogue was simultaneously recorded offscreen by actress Joan Barry  Ondra s British film career was over  64  The first successful European dramatic talkie was the all British Blackmail  Directed by twenty nine year old Alfred Hitchcock  the movie had its London debut June 21  1929  Originally shot as a silent  Blackmail was restaged to include dialogue sequences  along with a score and sound effects  before its premiere  A British International Pictures  BIP  production  it was recorded on RCA Photophone  General Electric having bought a share of AEG in order to gain access to the Tobis Klangfilm markets  Blackmail was a substantial hit  critical response was also positive notorious curmudgeon Hugh Castle  for example  called it  perhaps the most intelligent mixture of sound and silence we have yet seen   65  On August 23  the modest sized Austrian film industry came out with a talkie  G schichten aus der Steiermark  Stories from Styria   an Eagle Film Ottoton Film production  66  On September 30  the first entirely German made feature length dramatic talkie  Das Land ohne Frauen  Land Without Women   premiered  A Tobis Filmkunst production  about one quarter of the movie contained dialogue  which was strictly segregated from the special effects and music  The response was underwhelming  67  Sweden s first talkie  Konstgjorda Svensson  Artificial Svensson   premiered on October 14  Eight days later  Aubert Franco Film came out with Le Collier de la reine  The Queen s Necklace   shot at the  pinay studio near Paris  Conceived as a silent film  it was given a Tobis recorded score and a single talking sequence the first dialogue scene in a French feature  On October 31  Les Trois masques debuted  a Path  Natan film  it is generally regarded as the initial French feature talkie  though it was shot  like Blackmail  at the Elstree studio  just outside of London  The production company had contracted with RCA Photophone and Britain then had the nearest facility with the system  The Braunberger Richeb  talkie La Route est belle  also shot at Elstree  followed a few weeks later  68  Before the Paris studios were fully sound equipped a process that stretched well into 1930 a number of other early French talkies were shot in Germany  69  The first all talking German feature  Atlantik  had premiered in Berlin on October 28  Yet another Elstree made movie  it was rather less German at heart than Les Trois masques and La Route est belle were French  a BIP production with a British scenarist and German director  it was also shot in English as Atlantic  70  The entirely German Aafa Film production Dich hab ich geliebt  Because I Loved You  opened three and a half weeks later  It was not  Germany s First Talking Film   as the marketing had it  but it was the first to be released in the United States  71  The first Soviet talkie  Putevka v zhizn  The Road to Life  1931   concerns the issue of homeless youth  As Marcel Carn  put it   in the unforgettable images of this spare and pure story we can discern the effort of an entire nation   72  In 1930  the first Polish talkies premiered  using sound on disc systems  Moralno   pani Dulskiej  The Morality of Mrs  Dulska  in March and the all talking Niebezpieczny romans  Dangerous Love Affair  in October  73  In Italy  whose once vibrant film industry had become moribund by the late 1920s  the first talkie  La Canzone dell amore  The Song of Love   also came out in October  within two years  Italian cinema would be enjoying a revival  74  The first movie spoken in Czech debuted in 1930 as well  Tonka  ibenice  Tonka of the Gallows   75  Several European nations with minor positions in the field also produced their first talking pictures Belgium  in French   Denmark  Greece  and Romania  76  The Soviet Union s robust film industry came out with its first sound features in December 1930  Dziga Vertov s nonfiction Entuziazm had an experimental  dialogueless soundtrack  Abram Room s documentary Plan velikikh rabot  The Plan of the Great Works  had music and spoken voiceovers  77  Both were made with locally developed sound on film systems  two of the two hundred or so movie sound systems then available somewhere in the world  78  In June 1931  the Nikolai Ekk drama Putevka v zhizn  The Road to Life or A Start in Life   premiered as the Soviet Union s first true talking picture  79  Throughout much of Europe  conversion of exhibition venues lagged well behind production capacity  requiring talkies to be produced in parallel silent versions or simply shown without sound in many places  While the pace of conversion was relatively swift in Britain with over 60 percent of theaters equipped for sound by the end of 1930  similar to the U S  figure in France  by contrast  more than half of theaters nationwide were still projecting in silence by late 1932  80  According to scholar Colin G  Crisp   Anxiety about resuscitating the flow of silent films was frequently expressed in the  French  industrial press  and a large section of the industry still saw the silent as a viable artistic and commercial prospect till about 1935   81  The situation was particularly acute in the Soviet Union  as of May 1933  fewer than one out of every hundred film projectors in the country was as yet equipped for sound  82   edit  Transition  Asia Director Heinosuke Gosho s Madamu to nyobo  The Neighbor s Wife and Mine  1931   a production of the Shochiku studio  was the first major commercial and critical success of Japanese sound cinema  83  During the 1920s and 1930s  Japan was one of the world s two largest producers of motion pictures  along with the United States  Though the country s film industry was among the first to produce both sound and talking features  the full changeover to sound proceeded much more slowly than in the West  It appears that the first Japanese sound film  Reimai  Dawn   was made in 1926 with the De Forest Phonofilm system  84  Using the sound on disc Minatoki system  the leading Nikkatsu studio produced a pair of talkies in 1929  Taii no musume  The Captain s Daughter  and Furusato  Hometown   the latter directed by Kenji Mizoguchi  The rival Shochiku studio began the successful production of sound on film talkies in 1931 using a variable density process called Tsuchibashi  85  Two years later  however  more than 80 percent of movies made in the country were still silents  86  Two of the country s leading directors  Mikio Naruse and Yasujiro Ozu  did not make their first sound films until 1935 and 1936  respectively  87  As late as 1938  over a third of all movies produced in Japan were shot without dialogue  86  The enduring popularity of the silent medium in Japanese cinema owed in great part to the tradition of the benshi  a live narrator who performed as accompaniment to a film screening  As director Akira Kurosawa later described  the benshi  not only recounted the plot of the films  they enhanced the emotional content by performing the voices and sound effects and providing evocative descriptions of events and images on the screen     The most popular narrators were stars in their own right  solely responsible for the patronage of a particular theatre   88  Film historian Mariann Lewinsky argues  The end of silent film in the West and in Japan was imposed by the industry and the market  not by any inner need or natural evolution     Silent cinema was a highly pleasurable and fully mature form  It didn t lack anything  least in Japan  where there was always the human voice doing the dialogues and the commentary  Sound films were not better  just more economical  As a cinema owner you didn t have to pay the wages of musicians and benshi any more  And a good benshi was a star demanding star payment  89  By the same token  the viability of the benshi system facilitated a gradual transition to sound allowing the studios to spread out the capital costs of conversion and their directors and technical crews time to become familiar with the new technology  90  Alam Ara premiered March 14  1931  in Bombay  The first Indian talkie was so popular that  police aid had to be summoned to control the crowds   91  It was shot with the Tanar single system camera  which recorded sound directly onto the film  The Mandarin language G n  h ng m d n         Singsong Girl Red Peony   starring Butterfly Wu  premiered as China s first feature talkie in 1930  By February of that year  production was apparently completed on a sound version of The Devil s Playground  arguably qualifying it as the first Australian talking motion picture  however  the May press screening of Commonwealth Film Contest prizewinner Fellers is the first verifiable public exhibition of an Australian talkie  92  In September 1930  a song performed by Indian star Sulochana  excerpted from the silent feature Madhuri  1928   was released as a synchronized sound short  the country s first  93  The following year  Ardeshir Irani directed the first Indian talking feature  the Hindi Urdu Alam Ara  and produced Kalidas  primarily in Tamil with some Telugu  Nineteen thirty one also saw the first Bengali language film  Jamai Sasthi  and the first movie fully spoken in Telugu  Bhakta Prahlada  94  95  In 1932  Ayodhyecha Raja became the first movie in which Marathi was spoken to be released  though Sant Tukaram was the first to go through the official censorship process   the first Gujarati language film  Narsimha Mehta  and all Tamil talkie  Kalava  debuted as well  The next year  Ardeshir Irani produced the first Persian language talkie  Dukhtar e loor  96  Also in 1933  the first Cantonese language films were produced in Hong Kong Sha zai dongfang  The Idiot s Wedding Night  and Liang xing  Conscience   within two years  the local film industry had fully converted to sound  97  Korea  where pyonsa  or byun sa  held a role and status similar to that of the Japanese benshi  98  in 1935 became the last country with a significant film industry to produce its first talking picture  Chunhyangjeon           is based on the seventeenth century pansori folktale  Chunhyangga   of which as many as fifteen film versions have been made through 2009  99   edit  Consequences  edit  Technology Show Girl in Hollywood  1930   one of the first sound films about sound filmmaking  depicts microphones dangling from the rafters and multiple cameras shooting simultaneously from soundproofed booths  The poster shows a camera unboothed and unblimped  as it might be when shooting a musical number with a prerecorded soundtrack  In the short term  the introduction of live sound recording caused major difficulties in production  Cameras were noisy  so a soundproofed cabinet was used in many of the earliest talkies to isolate the loud equipment from the actors  at the expense of a drastic reduction in the ability to move the camera  For a time  multiple camera shooting was used to compensate for the loss of mobility and innovative studio technicians could often find ways to liberate the camera for particular shots  The necessity of staying within range of still microphones meant that actors also often had to limit their movements unnaturally  Show Girl in Hollywood  1930   from First National Pictures  which Warner Bros  had taken control of thanks to its profitable adventure into sound   gives a behind the scenes look at some of the techniques involved in shooting early talkies  Several of the fundamental problems caused by the transition to sound were soon solved with new camera casings  known as  blimps   designed to suppress noise and boom microphones that could be held just out of frame and moved with the actors  In 1931  a major improvement in playback fidelity was introduced  three way speaker systems in which sound was separated into low  medium  and high frequencies and sent respectively to a large bass  woofer   a midrange driver  and a treble  tweeter   100  There were consequences  as well  for other technological aspects of the cinema  Proper recording and playback of sound required exact standardization of camera and projector speed  Before sound  16 frames per second  fps  was the supposed norm  but practice varied widely  Cameras were often undercranked or overcranked in order to improve exposures or for dramatic effect  Projectors were commonly run too fast in order to shorten running time and squeeze in extra shows  Variable frame rate  however  made sound unlistenable  and a new  strict standard of 24 fps was soon established  101  Sound also forced the abandonment of the noisy arc lights used for filming in studio interiors  The switch to quiet incandescent illumination in turn required a switch to more expensive film stock  The sensitivity of the new panchromatic film delivered superior image tonal quality and gave directors the freedom to shoot scenes at lower light levels than was previously practical  101  As David Bordwell describes  technological improvements continued at a swift pace   Between 1932 and 1935   Western Electric and RCA  created directional microphones  increased the frequency range of film recording  reduced ground noise     and extended the volume range   These technical advances often meant new aesthetic opportunities   Increasing the fidelity of recording     heightened the dramatic possibilities of vocal timbre  pitch  and loudness   102  Another basic problem famously spoofed in the 1952 film Singin  in the Rain was that some silent era actors simply did not have attractive voices  though this issue was frequently overstated  there were related concerns about general vocal quality and the casting of performers for their dramatic skills in roles also requiring singing talent beyond their own  By 1935  rerecording of vocals by the original or different actors in postproduction  a process known as  looping   had become practical  The ultraviolet recording system introduced by RCA in 1936 improved the reproduction of sibilants and high notes  103  Example of a variable area sound track the width of the white area is proportional to the amplitude of the audio signal at each instant  With Hollywood s wholesale adoption of the talkies  the competition between the two fundamental approaches to sound film production was soon resolved  Over the course of 1930 31  the only major players using sound on disc  Warner Bros  and First National  changed over to sound on film recording  Vitaphone s dominating presence in sound equipped theaters  however  meant that for years to come all of the Hollywood studios pressed and distributed sound on disc versions of their films alongside the sound on film prints  104  Fox Movietone soon followed Vitaphone into disuse as a recording and reproduction method  leaving two major American systems  the variable area RCA Photophone and Western Electric s own variable density process  a substantial improvement on the cross licensed Movietone  105  Under RCA s instigation  the two parent companies made their projection equipment compatible  meaning films shot with one system could be screened in theaters equipped for the other  106  This left one big issue the Tobis Klangfilm challenge  In May 1930  Western Electric won an Austrian lawsuit that voided protection for certain Tri Ergon patents  helping bring Tobis Klangfilm to the negotiating table  107  The following month an accord was reached on patent cross licensing  full playback compatibility  and the division of the world into three parts for the provision of equipment  As a contemporary report describes  Tobis Klangfilm has the exclusive rights to provide equipment for  Germany  Danzig  Austria  Hungary  Switzerland  Czechoslovakia  Holland  the Dutch Indies  Denmark  Sweden  Norway  Bulgaria  Romania  Yugoslavia  and Finland  The Americans have the exclusive rights for the United States  Canada  Australia  New Zealand  India  and Russia  All other countries  among them Italy  France  and England  are open to both parties  108  The agreement did not resolve all the patent disputes  and further negotiations were undertaken and concords signed over the course of the 1930s  During these years  as well  the American studios began abandoning the Western Electric system for RCA Photophone s variable area approach by the end of 1936  only Paramount  MGM  and United Artists still had contracts with ERPI  109   edit  Labor The unkind cover of Photoplay  December 1929  featuring Norma Talmadge  As movie historian David Thomson puts it   sound proved the incongruity of  her  salon prettiness and tenement voice   110  While the introduction of sound led to a boom in the motion picture industry  it had an adverse effect on the employability of a host of Hollywood actors of the time  Suddenly those without stage experience were regarded as suspect by the studios  as suggested above  those whose heavy accents or otherwise discordant voices had previously been concealed were particularly at risk  The career of major silent star Norma Talmadge effectively came to an end in this way  The celebrated German actor Emil Jannings returned to Europe  Moviegoers found John Gilbert s voice an awkward match with his swashbuckling persona  and his star also faded  111  Audiences now seemed to perceive certain silent era stars as old fashioned  even those who had the talent to succeed in the sound era  The career of Harold Lloyd  one of the top screen comedians of the 1920s  declined precipitously  112 Lillian Gish departed  back to the stage  and other leading figures soon left acting entirely  Colleen Moore  Gloria Swanson  and Hollywood s most famous performing couple  Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford  113  As actress Louise Brooks suggested  there were other issues as well  Studio heads  now forced into unprecedented decisions  decided to begin with the actors  the least palatable  the most vulnerable part of movie production  It was such a splendid opportunity  anyhow  for breaking contracts  cutting salaries  and taming the stars     Me  they gave the salary treatment  I could stay on without the raise my contract called for  or quit   Paramount studio chief B  P   Schulberg said  using the questionable dodge of whether I d be good for the talkies  Questionable  I say  because I spoke decent English in a decent voice and came from the theater  So without hesitation I quit  114  Similarly  Clara Bow s speaking voice was sometimes blamed for the demise of her Hollywood career  though the real issues involved her clashes with studio executives and what film historian David Thomson describes as the  backlash of bourgeois hypocrisy  against a lifestyle that would have been unremarkable for a male star  115 Buster Keaton was eager to explore the new medium  but when his studio  MGM  made the changeover to sound  he was quickly stripped of creative control  Though a number of Keaton s early talkies made impressive profits  they were artistically dismal  116  Several of the new medium s biggest attractions came from vaudeville and the musical theater  where performers such as Jolson  Eddie Cantor  Jeanette MacDonald  and the Marx Brothers were accustomed to the demands of both dialogue and song  117 James Cagney and Joan Blondell  who had teamed on Broadway  were brought west together by Warner Bros  in 1930  118  A few actors were major stars during both the silent and the sound eras  Richard Barthelmess  Clive Brook  Bebe Daniels  Norma Shearer  the comedy team of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy  and the incomparable Charlie Chaplin  whose City Lights  1931  and Modern Times  1936  employed sound almost exclusively for music and effects  119 Janet Gaynor became a top star with the synch sound but dialogueless Seventh Heaven and Sunrise  as did Joan Crawford with the technologically similar Our Dancing Daughters  1928   120 Greta Garbo was the one non native English speaker to achieve Hollywood stardom on either side of the great sound divide  121  As talking pictures emerged  with their prerecorded musical tracks  an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out of work  122  More than just their position as film accompanists was usurped  according to historian Preston J  Hubbard   During the 1920s live musical performances at first run theaters became an exceedingly important aspect of the American cinema   123  With the coming of the talkies  those featured performances usually staged as preludes were largely eliminated as well  The American Federation of Musicians took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement of live musicians with mechanical playing devices  One 1929 ad that appeared in the Pittsburgh Press features an image of a can labeled  Canned Music   Big Noise Brand   Guaranteed to Produce No Intellectual or Emotional Reaction Whatever  and reads in part  Canned Music on Trial This is the case of Art vs  Mechanical Music in theatres  The defendant stands accused in front of the American people of attempted corruption of musical appreciation and discouragement of musical education  Theatres in many cities are offering synchronised mechanical music as a substitute for Real Music  If the theatre going public accepts this vitiation of its entertainment program a deplorable decline in the Art of Music is inevitable  Musical authorities know that the soul of the Art is lost in mechanisation  It cannot be otherwise because the quality of music is dependent on the mood of the artist  upon the human contact  without which the essence of intellectual stimulation and emotional rapture is lost  124  By the following year  a reported 22 000 U S  moviehouse musicians had lost their jobs  125   edit  Commerce Premiering February 1  1929  MGM s The Broadway Melody was the first smash hit talkie from a studio other than Warner Bros  and the first sound film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture  In September 1926  Jack Warner  head of Warner Bros   was quoted to the effect that talking pictures would never be viable   They fail to take into account the international language of the silent pictures  and the unconscious share of each onlooker in creating the play  the action  the plot  and the imagined dialogue for himself   126  Much to his company s benefit  he would be proven very wrong between the 1927 28 and 1928 29 fiscal years  Warners  profits surged from  2 million to  14 million  Sound film  in fact  was a clear boon to all the major players in the industry  During that same twelve month span  Paramount s profits rose by  7 million  Fox s by  3 5 million  and Loew s MGM s by  3 million  127  RKO  which hadn t even existed in September 1928 and whose parent production company  FBO  was in the Hollywood minor leagues  by the end of 1929 was established as one of America s leading entertainment businesses  128  Fueling the boom was the emergence of an important new cinematic genre made possible by sound  the musical  Over sixty Hollywood musicals were released in 1929  and more than eighty the following year  129  Even as the Wall Street crash of October 1929 helped plunge the United States and ultimately the global economy into depression  the popularity of the talkies at first seemed to keep Hollywood immune  The 1929 30 exhibition season was even better for the motion picture industry than the previous  with ticket sales and overall profits hitting new highs  Reality finally struck later in 1930  but sound had clearly secured Hollywood s position as one of the most important industrial fields  both commercially and culturally  in the United States  In 1929  film box office receipts comprised 16 6 percent of total spending by Americans on recreation  by 1931  the figure had reached 21 8 percent  The motion picture business would command similar figures for the next decade and a half  130  Hollywood ruled on the larger stage  as well  The American movie industry already the world s most powerful set an export record in 1929 that  by the applied measure of total feet of exposed film  was 27 percent higher than the year before  131  Concerns that language differences would hamper U S  film exports turned out to be largely unfounded  In fact  the expense of sound conversion was a major obstacle to many overseas producers  relatively undercapitalized by Hollywood standards  The production of multiple versions of export bound talkies in different languages  a common approach at first  largely ceased by mid 1931  replaced by post dubbing and subtitling  Despite trade restrictions imposed in most foreign markets  by 1937  American films commanded about 70 percent of screen time around the globe  132  Poster for Acabaram se os ot rios  1929   performed in Portuguese  The first Brazilian talkie was also the first anywhere in an Iberian language  Just as the leading Hollywood studios gained from sound in relation to their foreign competitors  they did the same at home  As historian Richard B  Jewell describes   The sound revolution crushed many small film companies and producers who were unable to meet the financial demands of sound conversion   133  The combination of sound and the Great Depression led to a wholesale shakeout in the business  resulting in the hierarchy of the Big Five integrated companies  MGM  Paramount  Fox  Warners  RKO  and the three smaller studios also called  majors   Columbia  Universal  United Artists  that would predominate through the 1950s  Historian Thomas Schatz describes the ancillary effects  Because the studios were forced to streamline operations and rely on their own resources  their individual house styles and corporate personalities came into much sharper focus  Thus the watershed period from the coming of sound into the early Depression saw the studio system finally coalesce  with the individual studios coming to terms with their own identities and their respective positions within the industry  134  The other country in which sound cinema had an immediate major commercial impact was India  As one distributor of the period said   With the coming of the talkies  the Indian motion picture came into its own as a definite and distinctive piece of creation  This was achieved by music   135  From its earliest days  Indian sound cinema has been defined by the musical Alam Ara featured seven songs  a year later  Indrasabha would feature seventy  While the European film industries fought an endless battle against the popularity and economic muscle of Hollywood  ten years after the debut of Alam Ara  over 90 percent of the films showing on Indian screens were made within the country  136  Most of India s early talkies were shot in Bombay  which remains the leading production center  but sound filmmaking soon spread across the multilingual nation  Within just a few weeks of Alam Ara s March 1931 premiere  the Calcutta based Madan Pictures had released both the Hindi Shirin Farhad and the Bengali Jamai Sasthi  137  The Hindustani Heer Ranjha was produced in Lahore  Punjab  the following year  In 1934  Sati Sulochana  the first Kannada talking picture to be released  was shot in Kolhapur  Maharashtra  Srinivasa Kalyanam became the first Tamil talkie actually shot in Tamil Nadu  95  138  Once the first talkie features appeared  the conversion to full sound production happened as rapidly in India as it did in the United States  Already by 1932  the majority of feature productions were in sound  two years later  164 of the 172 Indian feature films were talking pictures  139  Since 1934  with the sole exception of 1952  India has been among the top three movie producing countries in the world every single year  140   edit  Aesthetic quality In the first  1930 edition of his global survey The Film Till Now  British cinema pundit Paul Rotha declared   A film in which the speech and sound effects are perfectly synchronised and coincide with their visual image on the screen is absolutely contrary to the aims of cinema  It is a degenerate and misguided attempt to destroy the real use of the film and cannot be accepted as coming within the true boundaries of the cinema   141  Such opinions were not rare among those who cared about cinema as an art form  Alfred Hitchcock  though he directed the first commercially successful talkie produced in Europe  held that  the silent pictures were the purest form of cinema  and scoffed at many early sound films as delivering little beside  photographs of people talking   142  In Germany  Max Reinhardt  stage producer and movie director  expressed the belief that the talkies   bringing to the screen stage plays     tend to make this independent art a subsidiary of the theater and really make it only a substitute for the theater instead of an art in itself     like reproductions of paintings   143  Westfront 1918  1930  was celebrated for its expressive re creation of battlefield sounds  like the doomful whine of an unseen grenade in flight  144  In the opinion of many film historians and aficionados  both at the time and subsequently  silent film had reached an aesthetic peak by the late 1920s and the early years of sound cinema delivered little that was comparable to the best of the silents  145  For instance  despite fading into relative obscurity once its era had passed  silent cinema is represented by eleven films in Time Out s Centenary of Cinema Top One Hundred poll  held in 1995  The first year in which sound film production predominated over silent film not only in the United States  but also in the West as a whole was 1929  yet the years 1929 through 1933 are represented by three dialogueless pictures  Pandora s Box  1929   Zemlya  1930   City Lights  1931   and zero talkies in the Time Out poll   City Lights  like Sunrise  was released with a recorded score and sound effects  but is now customarily referred to by historians and industry professionals as a  silent  spoken dialogue regarded as the crucial distinguishing factor between silent and sound dramatic cinema   The earliest sound film to place is the French L Atalante  1934   directed by Jean Vigo  the earliest Hollywood sound film to qualify is Bringing Up Baby  1938   directed by Howard Hawks  146  The first sound feature film to receive near universal critical approbation was Der Blaue Engel  The Blue Angel   premiering on April 1  1930  it was directed by Josef von Sternberg in both German and English versions for Berlin s UFA studio  147  The first American talkie to be widely honored was All Quiet on the Western Front  directed by Lewis Milestone  which premiered April 21  The other internationally acclaimed sound drama of the year was Westfront 1918  directed by G  W  Pabst for Nero Film of Berlin  148  Historian Anton Kaes points to it as an example of  the new verisimilitude  that  rendered silent cinema s former emphasis on the hypnotic gaze and the symbolism of light and shadow  as well as its preference for allegorical characters  anachronistic   144  Cultural historians consider the French L  ge d Or  directed by Luis Bu uel  which appeared late in 1930  to be of great aesthetic import  at the time  its erotic  blasphemous  anti bourgeois content caused a scandal  Swiftly banned by Paris police chief Jean Chiappe  it was unavailable for fifty years  149  The earliest sound movie now acknowledged by most film historians as a masterpiece is Nero Film s M  directed by Fritz Lang  which premiered May 11  1931  150  As described by Roger Ebert   Many early talkies felt they had to talk all the time  but Lang allows his camera to prowl through the streets and dives  providing a rat s eye view   151   edit  Cinematic form  Talking film is as little needed as a singing book   152  Such was the blunt proclamation of critic Viktor Shklovsky  one of the leaders of the Russian formalist movement  in 1927  While some regarded sound as irreconcilable with film art  others saw it as opening a new field of creative opportunity  The following year  a group of Soviet filmmakers  including Sergei Eisenstein  proclaimed that the use of image and sound in juxtaposition  the so called contrapuntal method  would raise the cinema to  unprecedented power and cultural height  Such a method for constructing the sound film will not confine it to a national market  as must happen with the photographing of plays  but will give a greater possibility than ever before for the circulation throughout the world of a filmically expressed idea   153  So far as one segment of the audience was concerned  however  the introduction of sound brought a virtual end to such circulation  Elizabeth C  Hamilton writes   Silent films offered people who were deaf a rare opportunity to participate in a public discourse  cinema  on equal terms with hearing people  The emergence of sound film effectively separated deaf from hearing audience members once again   154  Image of sumo wrestlers from Melodie der Welt  1929    one of the initial successes of a new art form   in Andr  Bazin s description   It flung the whole earth onto the screen in a jigsaw of visual images and sounds   155  On March 12  1929  the first feature length talking picture made in Germany had its premiere  The inaugural Tobis Filmkunst production  it was not a drama  but a documentary sponsored by a shipping line  Melodie der Welt  Melody of the World   directed by Walter Ruttmann  156  This was also perhaps the first feature film anywhere to significantly explore the artistic possibilities of joining the motion picture with recorded sound  As described by scholar William Moritz  the movie is  intricate  dynamic  fast paced     juxtapos ing  similar cultural habits from countries around the world  with a superb orchestral score     and many synchronized sound effects   157  Composer Lou Lichtveld was among a number of contemporary artists struck by the film   Melodie der Welt became the first important sound documentary  the first in which musical and unmusical sounds were composed into a single unit and in which image and sound are controlled by one and the same impulse   158 Melodie der Welt was a direct influence on the industrial film Philips Radio  1931   directed by Dutch avant garde filmmaker Joris Ivens and scored by Lichtveld  who described its audiovisual aims  To render the half musical impressions of factory sounds in a complex audio world that moved from absolute music to the purely documentary noises of nature  In this film every intermediate stage can be found  such as the movement of the machine interpreted by the music  the noises of the machine dominating the musical background  the music itself is the documentary  and those scenes where the pure sound of the machine goes solo  159  Many similar experiments were pursued by Dziga Vertov in his 1931 Entuziazm and by Chaplin in Modern Times  a half decade later  A few innovative commercial directors immediately saw the ways in which sound could be employed as an integral part of cinematic storytelling  beyond the obvious function of recording speech  In Blackmail  Hitchcock manipulated the reproduction of a character s monologue so the word  knife  would leap out from a blurry stream of sound  reflecting the subjective impression of the protagonist  who is desperate to conceal her involvement in a fatal stabbing  160  In his first film  the Paramount Applause  1929   Rouben Mamoulian created the illusion of acoustic depth by varying the volume of ambient sound in proportion to the distance of shots  At a certain point  Mamoulian wanted the audience to hear one character singing at the same time as another prays  according to the director   They said we couldn t record the two things the song and the prayer on one mike and one channel  So I said to the sound man   Why not use two mikes and two channels and combine the two tracks in printing    161  Such methods would eventually become standard procedure in popular filmmaking  One of the first commercial films to take full advantage of the new opportunities provided by recorded sound was Le Million  directed by Ren  Clair and produced by Tobis s French division  Premiering in Paris in April 1931 and New York a month later  the picture was both a critical and popular success  A musical comedy with a barebones plot  it is memorable for its formal accomplishments  in particular  its emphatically artificial treatment of sound  As described by scholar Donald Crafton  Le Million never lets us forget that the acoustic component is as much a construction as the whitewashed sets   It  replaced dialogue with actors singing and talking in rhyming couplets  Clair created teasing confusions between on  and off screen sound  He also experimented with asynchronous audio tricks  as in the famous scene in which a chase after a coat is synched to the cheers of an invisible football  or rugby  crowd  162  These and similar techniques became part of the vocabulary of the sound comedy film  though as special effects and  color   not as the basis for the kind of comprehensive  non naturalistic design achieved by Clair  Outside of the comedic field  the sort of bold play with sound exemplified by Melodie der Welt and Le Million would be pursued very rarely in commercial production  Hollywood  in particular  incorporated sound into a reliable system of genre based moviemaking  in which the formal possibilities of the new medium were subordinated to the traditional goals of star affirmation and straightforward storytelling  As accurately predicted in 1928 by Frank Woods  secretary of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences   The talking pictures of the future will follow the general line of treatment heretofore developed by the silent drama     The talking scenes will require different handling  but the general construction of the story will be much the same   163   edit  See also History of film Sound stage

 Musical development has kept pace with good taste and ethics throughout the ages  and has influenced the gentler nature of man more powerfully perhaps than any other factor  Has it remained for the Great Age of Science to snub the Art by setting up in its place a pale and feeble shadow of itself    Oderman  2000   p  188     Talking Movies   1926     Gomery  1985   pp  66 67  Gomery describes the difference in profits simply between 1928 and 1929  but it seems clear from the figures cited that he is referring to the fiscal years that ended September 30  The fiscal year roughly paralleled  but was still almost a month off from  the traditional Hollywood programming year the prime exhibition season began the first week of September with Labor Day and ran through Memorial Day at the end of May  this was followed by a fourteen week  open season   when films with minimal expectations were released and many theaters shut down for the hot summer months  See Crafton  1997   pp  183  268    Lasky  1989   p  51    Bradley  1996   p  279    Finler  2003   p  376    Segrave  1997  gives the figures as 282 million feet in 1929 compared to 222 million feet the year before  p  79   Crafton  1997  reports the new mark in this peculiar way   Exports in 1929 set a new record  282 215 480 feet  against the old record of 9 000 000 feet in 1919    p  418   But in 1913  for instance  the U S  exported 32 million feet of exposed film  Segrave  1997   p  65   Note also that Crafton says of the 1929 exports   Of course  most of this footage was silent   though he provides no figures  p  418   In contrast  if not necessarily contradiction  Segrave points to the following   At the very end of 1929 the New York Times reported that most U S  talkies went abroad as originally created for domestic screening   p  77     Eckes and Zeiler  2003   p  102    Jewell  1982   p  9    Schatz  1998   p  70    Quoted in Ganti  2004   p  11    Ganti  2004   p  11    Rajadhyaksha and Willemen  2002
