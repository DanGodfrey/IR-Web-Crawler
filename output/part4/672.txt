the Pacific Ocean located between Australia  New Zealand and New Caledonia  The island is part of the Commonwealth of Australia  but it enjoys a large degree of self governance  Together with two neighbouring islands  it forms one of Australia s external territories  Originally colonised by East Polynesians  Norfolk Island was colonised by Britain as part of its settlement in Australia in 1788  It then served as a convict penal settlement until 1794  when it was abandoned until 1856  when permanent residence on the island for civilians began  In 1901  the island became a part of the Commonwealth of Australia which it has remained until this day  The evergreen Norfolk Island pine is a symbol of the island and thus pictured on its flag  see illustration   Native to the island  the pine is a key export industry for Norfolk Island  being a popular ornamental tree on mainland Australia  where two related species grow  and also in Europe  Contents 1 History 1 1 Early history 1 2

Islands north of New Zealand or from the North Island of New Zealand  They arrived in the fourteenth or fifteenth century  and survived for several generations before disappearing  The first European known to have sighted the island was Captain James Cook  in 1774  on his second voyage to the South Pacific on HMS Resolution  He named it after the Duchess of Norfolk  wife of Edward Howard  9th Duke of Norfolk  1685 1777   Sir John Call argued the advantages of Norfolk Island in that it was uninhabited and that flax grew there  In 1786 the British government included Norfolk Island as an auxiliary settlement  as proposed by John Call  in its plan for colonization of New South Wales  The decision to settle Norfolk Island was taken due to Empress Catherine of Russia s decision to restrict sales of hemp  Practically all the hemp and flax required by the Royal Navy for cordage and sailcloth was imported from Russia  When the First Fleet arrived at Port Jackson in January 1788  Phillip ordered Lieutenant Philip Gidley King to lead a party of 15 convicts and seven free men to take control of Norfolk Island and prepare for its commercial development  They arrived on 6 March 1788  During the first year of the settlement  which was also called  Sydney  like its parent  more convicts and soldiers were sent to the island from New South Wales   edit  Nineteenth century Norfolk Island gaol As early as 1794  Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales Francis Grose suggested its closure as a penal settlement  as it was too remote and difficult for shipping and too costly to maintain  3  The first group of people left in February 1805  and by 1808 only about 200 remained  forming a small settlement until the remnants were removed in 1813  A small party remained to slaughter stock and destroy all buildings  so that there would be no inducement for anyone  especially from other European powers  to visit and lay claim to the place  From 15 February 1814 to 6 June 1825 the island was abandoned  In 1824 the British government instructed the Governor of New South Wales Thomas Brisbane to occupy Norfolk Island as a place to send  the worst description of convicts   Its remoteness  previously seen as a disadvantage  was now viewed as an asset for the detention of recalcitrant male prisoners  The convicts detained have long been assumed be a hardcore of recidivists  or  doubly convicted capital respites    that is  men transported to Australia who committed fresh colonial crimes for which they were sentenced to death  and were spared the gallows on condition of life at Norfolk Island  However  a recent study has demonstrated  utilising a database of 6 458 Norfolk Island convicts  that the reality was somewhat different  more than half were detained at Norfolk Island without ever receiving a colonial conviction  and only 15  had been reprieved from a death sentence  Furthermore  the overwhelming majority of convicts sent to Norfolk Island had committed non violent property sentences  the average length of detention was three years  and the scale of punishments inflicted upon the prisoners was significantly less than assumed  4  The second penal settlement began to be wound down by the British government after 1847  and the last convicts were removed to Tasmania in May 1855  The island was abandoned because transportation from the United Kingdom to Van Diemen s Land had ceased in 1853  to be replaced by penal servitude in the UK  On 8 June 1856  the next settlement began on Norfolk Island  These were the descendants of Tahitians and the HMS Bounty mutineers  along with Fletcher Christian  They resettled from the Pitcairn Islands  which had become too small for their growing population  They left Pitcairn Islands on 3 May 1856 and arrived with 194 persons on 8 June  The Pitcairners occupied many of the buildings remaining from the penal settlements  and gradually established traditional farming and whaling industries on the island  Although some families decided to return to Pitcairn in 1858 and 1863  the island s population continued to grow  They accepted additional settlers  who often arrived with whaling fleets  In 1867  the headquarters of the Melanesian Mission of the Church of England was established on the island  In 1920 the Mission was relocated from Norfolk Island to the Solomon Islands to be closer to the population of focus   edit  Twentieth century After the creation of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901  Norfolk Island was placed under the authority of the new Commonwealth government to be administered as an external territory  This stamp was issued in 1981 to commemorate the first landing of an aircraft at the island  Sir Francis Chichester s Gypsy Moth  Mme Elijah   at Cascade Bay on 28 March 1931  During World War II  the island became a key airbase and refuelling depot between Australia and New Zealand  and New Zealand and the Solomon Islands  Since Norfolk Island fell within New Zealand s area of responsibility it was garrisoned by a New Zealand Army unit known as N Force at a large Army camp which had the capacity to house a 1 500 strong force  N Force relieved a company of the Second Australian Imperial Force  The island proved too remote to come under attack during the war and N Force left the island in February 1944  In 1979  Norfolk was granted limited self government by Australia  under which the island elects a government that runs most of the island s affairs  As such  residents of Norfolk Island are not represented in the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia  making them the only group of residents of an Australian state or territory not represented there  In 2006  a formal review process took place  in which the Australian government considered revising this model of government  The review was completed on 20 December 2006  when it was decided that there would be no changes in the governance of Norfolk Island  5  Financial problems and a reduction in tourism led to Norfolk Island s administration appealing to the Australian federal government for assistance in 2010  As a result Islanders will pay income tax for the first time but will be eligible for greater welfare benefits  6   edit  Geography View across to Nepean Island  foreground  and Phillip Island  Map of Norfolk Island  Norfolk Island is located in the South Pacific Ocean  east of the Australian mainland  Norfolk Island is the main island of the island group the territory encompasses and is located at 29 02 S 167 57 E     29 033 S 167 95 E     29 033  167 95  It has an area of 34 6 km   13 3 mi    with no large scale internal bodies of water and 32 km of coastline  The island s highest point is Mount Bates  319 m above sea level   located in the northwest quadrant of the island  The majority of the terrain is suitable for farming and other agricultural uses  Phillip Island  the second largest island of the territory  is located at 29 07 S 167 57 E     29 117 S 167 95 E     29 117  167 95  seven kilometres south of the main island  The coastline of Norfolk Island consists  to varying degrees  of cliff faces  A downward slope exists towards Slaughter Bay and Emily Bay  the site of the original colonial settlement of Kingston  There are no safe harbour facilities on Norfolk Island  with loading jetties existing at Kingston and Cascade Bay  All goods not domestically produced are brought in by ship  usually to Cascade Bay  Emily Bay  protected from the Pacific Ocean by a small coral reef  is the only safe area for recreational swimming  although surfing waves can be found at Anson and Ball Bays  The climate is subtropical and mild  with little seasonal differentiation  The island is the eroded remnant of a basaltic volcano active around 2 3 to 3 million years ago  7  with inland areas now consisting mainly of rolling plains  It forms the highest point on the Norfolk Ridge  part of the submerged continent Zealandia  The area surrounding Mount Bates is preserved as the Norfolk Island National Park  The park  covering around 10  of the land of the island  contains remnants of the forests which originally covered the island  including stands of subtropical rainforest  The park also includes the two smaller islands to the south of Norfolk Island  Nepean Island and Phillip Island  The vegetation of Phillip Island was devastated due to the introduction during the penal era of pest animals such as pigs and rabbits  giving it a red brown colour as viewed from Norfolk  however  pest control and remediation work by park staff has recently brought some improvement to the Phillip Island environment  The major settlement on Norfolk Island is Burnt Pine  located predominantly along Taylors Road  where the shopping centre  post office  liquor store  telephone exchange and community hall are located  Settlement also exists over much of the island  consisting largely of widely separated homesteads  Government House  the official residence of the Administrator  is located on Quality Row in what was the penal settlement of Kingston  Other government buildings  including the court  Legislative Assembly and Administration  are also located there  Kingston s role is largely a ceremonial one  however  with most of the economic impetus coming from Burnt Pine   edit  Gallery

temperature almost never falls below 10  C  50  F  or rises above 26  C  79  F   The absolute maximum recorded temperature is 28 4  C  83 1  F   while the absolute minimum is 6 2  C  43 2  F   8

species are rare or threatened  10  The Norfolk Island Palm  Rhopalostylis baueri  and the Smooth Tree fern  Cyathea brownii   the tallest tree fern in the world  10  are common in the Norfolk Island National Park but rare elsewhere on the island  Before European colonization  most of Norfolk Island was covered with subtropical rain forest  the canopy of which was made of Araucaria heterophylla  Norfolk Island Pine  in exposed areas  and the palm Rhopalostylis baueri and tree ferns Cyathea brownii and C  australis in moister protected areas  The understory was thick with lianas and ferns covered the forest floor  Only one small tract  5 km   of rainforest remains  which was declared as the Norfolk Island National Park in 1986  10  This forest has been infested with several introduced plants  The cliffs and steep slopes of Mount Pitt supported a community of shrubs  herbaceous plants  and climbers  A few tracts of clifftop and seashore vegetation have been preserved  The rest of the island has been cleared for pasture and housing  Grazing and introduced weeds currently threaten the native flora  displacing it in some areas  In fact  there are more weed species than native species on Norfolk Island  10   edit  Fauna As a relatively small and isolated oceanic island  Norfolk has few land birds but a high degree of endemicity among them  Many of the endemic species and subspecies have become extinct as a result of massive clearance of the island s native vegetation of subtropical rainforest for agriculture  hunting and persecution as agricultural pests  The birds have also suffered from the introduction of mammals such as rats  cats  pigs and goats  as well as from introduced competitors such as Common Blackbirds and Crimson Rosellas  11  Extinctions include that of the endemic Norfolk K k  and Norfolk Ground Dove along with endemic subspecies of pigeon  starling  triller  thrush and boobook owl  though the latter s genes persist in a hybrid population descended from the last female  Other endemic birds are the White chested White eye  which may be extinct  the Norfolk Parakeet  the Norfolk Gerygone  the Slender billed White eye and endemic subspecies of the Pacific Robin and Golden Whistler  11  The Norfolk Island Group is also home to breeding seabirds  The Providence Petrel was hunted to local extinction by the beginning of the 19th century  but has shown signs of returning to breed on Phillip Island  Other seabirds breeding there include the White necked Petrel  Kermadec Petrel  Wedge tailed Shearwater  Australasian Gannet  Red tailed Tropicbird and Grey Ternlet  The Sooty Tern  known locally as the Whale Bird  has traditionally been subject to seasonal egg harvesting by Norfolk Islanders  12  Norfolk Island  with neighbouring Nepean Island  has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because it supports the entire populations of White chested and Slender billed White eyes  Norfolk Parakeets and Norfolk Gerygones  as well as over 1  of the world populations of Wedge tailed Shearwaters and Red tailed Tropicbirds  Nearby Phillip Island is treated as a separate IBA  13  Norfolk Island has only one native mammal  Gould s Wattled Bat  Chalinolobus gouldii   It is very rare and may be extinct on the island  Gannet Masked Boobies White Tern Emily Bay Norfolk Island Pines Captain Cook Lookout Bird Rock  off the north coast  Cathedral Rock  off the north coast   edit  Demographics The population of Norfolk Island in the 2011 census was 2 302  which has declined since a high of 2 601 in 2001  1 220 of the 2001 census night population were female  and 1 082 male  78  of the population on census night were residents  with the remaining 22  visitors  16  of the population were 14 years and under  54  were 15 to 64 years and 24  were 65 years and over  The figures show an ageing population  with many people aged 20 34 having moved away from the island  14  Most islanders are of either European only  mostly British  or combined European Tahitian ancestry  being descendants of the Bounty mutineers as well as more recent arrivals from Australia and New Zealand  About half of the islanders can trace their roots back to Pitcairn Island  15  This common heritage has led to a limited number of surnames among the islanders   a limit constraining enough that the island s telephone directory also includes nicknames for many subscribers  such as Cane Toad  Dar Bizziebee  Lettuce Leaf  Goof  Paw Paw  Diddles  Rubber Duck  Carrots and Tarzan  15  16  62  of islanders are Christians  After the death of the first chaplain Rev G H Nobbs in 1884  a Methodist church was formed and in 1891 a Seventh day Adventist led by one of Nobbs  sons  Some unhappiness with G H Nobbs  the more organised and formal ritual of the Church of England service arising from the influence of the Melanesian Mission  decline in spirituality  the influence of visiting American whalers  literature sent by Christians overseas impressed by the Pitcairn story  and the adoption of Seventh day Adventism by the descendants of the mutineers still on Pitcairn  all contributed to these developments  The Roman Catholic Church began work in 1957 and in the late 1990s a group left the former Methodist  then Uniting Church  and formed a charismatic fellowship  In 2011  34  of the ordinary residents identified as Anglican  13  as Uniting Church  12  as Roman Catholic and 3  as Seventh day Adventist  9  were from other religions  24  had no religion  and 7  did not state their religion  14  Typical ordinary congregations in any church do not exceed 30 local residents as of 2010  The three older denominations have good facilities  Ministers are usually short term visitors  Literacy is not recorded officially  but it can be assumed to be roughly at a par with Australia s literacy rate  as islanders attend a school which uses a New South Wales curriculum  before traditionally moving to the mainland for further study  Islanders speak both English and a creole language known as Norfuk  a blend of 1700s English and Tahitian  The Norfuk language is decreasing in popularity as more tourists travel to the island and more young people leave for work and study reasons  however  there are efforts to keep it alive via dictionaries and the renaming of some tourist attractions to their Norfuk equivalents  In April 2005 it was declared a co official language of the island citation needed   32  of the total population reported speaking a language other than English in the 2011 census  and just under three quarters of the ordinarily resident population could speak Norfuk  14  Emigration is growing as many islanders take advantage of the close ties between Norfolk and Australia and New Zealand  The sole school on the island provides education to Australian Year 12  therefore  any student seeking to complete tertiary study must travel overseas  Additionally  the small economy of the island causes many skilled workers to emigrate as well   edit  Culture While there was no  indigenous  culture on the island at the time of settlement  the Tahitian influence of the Pitcairn settlers has resulted in some aspects of Polynesian culture being adapted to that of Norfolk  including the hula dance  Local cuisine also shows influences from the same region  Islanders traditionally spend a lot of time outdoors  with fishing and other aquatic pursuits being common pastimes  an aspect which has become more noticeable as the island becomes more accessible to tourism  Most island families have at least one member involved in primary production in some form  View across to Phillip Island As all the Pitcairn settlers were related to each other  islanders have historically been informal both to each other and to visitors  The most noticeable aspect of this is the  Norfolk Wave   with drivers waving to each other  ranging from a wave using the entire arm through to a raised index finger from the steering wheel  as they pass  Religious observance remains an important part of life for some islanders  particularly the older generations  but actual attendance is about 8  of the resident population plus some tourists  In the 2006 census 19 9  had no religion 17  compared with 13 2  in 1996  18  Businesses are closed on Sundays  One of the island s residents is the novelist Colleen McCullough  whose works include The Thorn Birds and the Masters of Rome series as well as Morgan s Run  set  in large part  on Norfolk Island  Helen Reddy also moved to the island for a period but was denied a long term entry permit  American novelist James A  Michener  who served in the United States Navy during World War II  set one of the chapters of his episodic novel Tales of the South Pacific on Norfolk Island  The island is one of the only locations outside of North America to celebrate the holiday of Thanksgiving  19   edit  Crime Though usually peaceful  Norfolk Island has been the site of two murders in the 21st century  20  In 2002  Janelle Patton  an Australian living on the island  was murdered  21  It was the first murder on the island since 1893  22  Two years later the Deputy Chief Minister of the island  Ivens Buffett  was found shot dead  becoming the first Australian minister to be murdered in office  23  Crime incidence is generally low on the island  although recent reports indicate that petty theft and dangerous driving are becoming more prevalent  The Patton murder prompted considerable debate  with some residents arguing that traditional loyalties would prevent a local being charged  In February 2006  28 year old New Zealand chef Glenn McNeill was arrested and charged with Patton s murder  21  McNeill had been working on Norfolk at the time and claimed at hearings in Australia and on Norfolk Island that he accidentally hit Patton with his car  a statement he later retracted  His trial ended on 9 March 2007  when the 11 person jury returned a guilty verdict  24  On 25 July 2007  McNeill was sentenced to a maximum 24 years in jail  Norfolk Island s Chief Justice Mark Weinberg  in a sentence handed down in a Sydney courthouse and broadcast live to Norfolk Island s court  said McNeill may be eligible for release after a minimum 18 years in prison  McNeill will serve his sentence in Australia  25   edit  Government and Politics Main article  Politics of Norfolk Island Norfolk Island is the only non mainland Australian territory to have achieved self governance  The Norfolk Island Act 1979  passed by the Parliament of Australia in 1979  is the Act under which the island is governed  The Australian government maintains authority on the island through an Administrator  currently Owen Walsh   who will complete his term on 31 March 2012   The next Administrator will be Neil Pope who was sworn in by the Governor General on Wednesday 21 March 2012  A Legislative Assembly is elected by popular vote for a term of not more than three years  although legislation passed by the Australian Parliament can extend its laws to the territory at will  including the power to override any laws made by the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly  The Assembly consists of nine seats  with electors casting nine equal votes  of which no more than four can be given to any individual candidate  It is a method of voting called a  weighted first past the post system   Four of the members of the Assembly form the Executive Council  which devises policy and acts as an advisory body to the Administrator  The current Chief Minister of Norfolk Island is David Buffett  Other ministers are Minister for Tourism  Industry and Development  Minister for Finance and Attorney General and Minister for Community Services  All seats are held by independent candidates  Norfolk Island has yet to embrace party politics  In 2007 a branch of the Australian Labor Party was formed on Norfolk Island  with the aim of reforming the system of government  Residents of Norfolk Island are entitled to enrol in a mainland Australian division in a state to which they have a connection  or the Division of Canberra in the ACT  or for the Division of Solomon in the NT  Enrollment for Norfolk Islanders is not compulsory  but once enrolled they must vote  26  In a move that apparently surprised many islanders the Chief Minister of Norfolk Island David Buffett announced on 6 November 2010 that the island would voluntarily surrender its self governing status in return for a financial bailout from the federal government to cover significant debts  27  The island s official capital is Kingston  it is  however  more a centre of government than a sizeable settlement  The largest settlement is at Burnt Pine  The most important local holiday is Bounty Day  celebrated on 8 June  in memory of the arrival of the Pitcairn Islanders in 1856  Local ordinances and acts apply on the island  where most laws are based on the Australian legal system  Australian common law applies when not covered by either Australian or Norfolk Island law  Suffrage is universal at age eighteen  As a territory of Australia  Norfolk Island does not have diplomatic representation abroad  or within the territory  and is also not a participant in any international organisations  other than sporting organisations  The flag is three vertical bands of green  hoist side   white  and green with a large green Norfolk Island pine tree centred in the slightly wider white band   edit  Constitutional status The exact status of Norfolk Island is controversial  Despite the island s status as a self governing territory of Australia 5  administered by the Attorney General s Department  28  some islanders claim that it was actually granted independence at the time Queen Victoria granted permission to Pitcairn Islanders to re settle on the island  29  These views have been repeatedly rejected by the Australian parliament s Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories  most recently in 2004  and were also rejected by the High Court of Australia in Berwick Limited v R R Gray Deputy Commissioner of Taxation  30  Disagreements over the island s relationship with Australia were put in sharper relief by a 2006 review undertaken by the Australian government  5  Under the more radical of two models proposed in the review  the island s legislative assembly would have been reduced to the status of a local council  15  However  in December 2006  citing the  significant disruption  that changes to the governance would impose on the island s economy  the Australian government ended the review leaving the existing governance arrangements unaltered  31   edit  Immigration and citizenship The island is subject to separate immigration controls from the remainder of the nation  Australian citizens and residents from other parts of the nation do not have automatic right of residence on the island  Australian citizens must carry either a passport or a Document of Identity to travel to Norfolk Island  Citizens of all other nations must carry a passport to travel to Norfolk Island even if arriving from other parts of Australia  Holders of Australian visas who travel to Norfolk Island have departed the Australian Migration Zone  Unless they hold a multiple entry visa  the visa will have ceased  in which case they will require another visa to re enter mainland Australia  32  Residency on Norfolk Island requires sponsorship by an existing resident of Norfolk Island or a business operating on the island  Temporary residency may also be granted to skilled workers necessary for the island s services  for example  medical  government and teaching staff   Non Australian citizens who are permanent residents of Norfolk Island may apply for Australian citizenship after meeting normal residence requirements and are eligible to take up residence in mainland Australia at any time through the use of a Permanent Resident of Norfolk Island visa  32  Children born on Norfolk Island are Australian citizens as specified by Australian nationality law  Non Australian citizens who are Australian permanent residents should be aware that during their stay on Norfolk Island they are  outside of Australia  for the purposes of the Migration Act  This means that not only will they need a still valid migrant visa or Resident return visa to return from Norfolk Island to the mainland  but also the time spent in Norfolk Island will not be counted for satisfying the residence requirement for obtaining a Resident return visa in the future  32  On the other hand  as far as Australian nationality law is concerned  Norfolk Island is a part of Australia  and any time spent by an Australian permanent resident on Norfolk Island apparently would count as time spent in Australia for the purposes of applying for Australian citizenship  33   edit  Medicare Medicare does not cover Norfolk Island  34  All visitors to Norfolk Island  including Australians  are recommended to purchase travel insurance  Serious medical conditions are not treated on the island  rather  the patient is flown back to mainland Australia  Air charter transport can cost in the order of A 25 000  This lack of medical facilities has a major impact on the health care of Norfolk Islanders  Many older residents find it impossible to remain on the island when their health falters  many have to leave their homes and live in New Zealand or Australia to get medical care   edit  Defence and law enforcement Defence is the responsibility of the Australian Defence Force  There are no active military installations or defence personnel on Norfolk Island  The Administrator may request the assistance of the Australian Defence Force if required  Civilian law enforcement and community policing is provided by the Australian Federal Police  The normal deployment to the island is one sergeant and two constables  These are augmented by five local Special Members who have police powers but are not AFP employees   edit  Economy and infrastructure Anson Bay  an attractive tourist spot Tourism  the primary economic activity  has steadily increased over the years  As Norfolk Island prohibits the importation of fresh fruit and vegetables  most produce is grown locally  Beef is both produced locally and imported  The Australian government controls the exclusive economic zone extending 200 nautical miles  370 km  around Norfolk Island and territorial sea claims to three nautical miles  6 km  from the island  The exclusive economic zone provides the islanders with fish  its only major natural resource  Norfolk Island has no direct control over any marine areas but has an agreement with the Commonwealth through the Australian Fisheries Management Authority  AFMA  to fish  recreationally  in a small section of the EEZ known locally as  the Box   While there is speculation that the zone may include oil and gas deposits this is not proven  15  There are no major arable lands or permanent farmlands  though about 25 per cent of the island is a permanent pasture  There is no irrigated land  The island uses the Australian dollar as its currency   edit  Taxes Residents of Norfolk Island do not pay Australian federal taxes  35  creating a tax haven for locals and visitors alike  Because there is no income tax  the island s legislative assembly raises money through an import duty  fuel levy  medicare levy  GST and local international phone calls  15  35   edit  Communications As of 2004  2532 telephone main lines are in use  a mix of analog  2500  and digital  32  circuits  36 Satellite service is planned  There is one TV station
