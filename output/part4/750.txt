in Downtown Houston Exxon Mobil Corporation was formed in 1999 by the merger of two major oil companies  Exxon and Mobil  Both Exxon and Mobil were descendants of the John D  Rockefeller corporation  Standard Oil which was established in 1870  The reputation of Standard Oil in the public eye suffered badly after publication of Ida M  Tarbell s classic expos  The History of the Standard Oil Company in 1904  leading to a growing outcry for the government to take action against the company  By 1911  with public outcry at a climax  the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that Standard Oil must be dissolved and split into 34 companies  Two of these companies were Jersey Standard   Standard Oil Company of New Jersey    which eventually became Exxon  and Socony   Standard Oil Company of New York    which eventually became Mobil  In the same year  the nation s kerosene output was eclipsed for the first time by gasoline  The growing automotive market inspired the product trademark Mobiloil  registered by Socony in 1920  Over the next few decades  both companies grew significantly  Jersey Standard  led by Walter C  Teagle  became the largest oil producer in the world  It acquired a 50 percent share in Humble Oil  amp  Refining Co   a Texas oil producer  Socony purchased a 45 percent interest in Magnolia Petroleum Co   a major refiner  marketer and pipeline transporter  In 1931  Socony merged with Vacuum Oil Co   an industry pioneer dating back to 1866 and a growing Standard Oil spin off in its own right  In the Asia Pacific region  Jersey Standard had oil production and refineries in Indonesia but no marketing network  Socony Vacuum had Asian marketing outlets supplied remotely from California  In 1933  Jersey Standard and Socony Vacuum merged their interests in the region into a 50 50 joint venture  Standard Vacuum Oil Co   or  Stanvac   operated in 50 countries  from East Africa to New Zealand  before it was dissolved in 1962  Mobil Chemical Company was established in 1950  As of 1999  its principal products included basic olefins and aromatics  ethylene glycol and polyethylene  The company produced synthetic lubricant base stocks as well as lubricant additives  propylene packaging films and catalysts  Exxon Chemical Company  first named Enjay Chemicals  became a worldwide organization in 1965 and in 1999 was a major producer and marketer of olefins  aromatics  polyethylene and polypropylene along with speciality lines such as elastomers  plasticizers  solvents  process fluids  oxo alcohols and adhesive resins  The company was an industry leader in metallocene catalyst technology to make unique polymers with improved performance  In 1955  Socony Vacuum became Socony Mobil Oil Co  and in 1966 simply Mobil Oil Corp  A decade later  the newly incorporated Mobil Corporation absorbed Mobil Oil as a wholly owned subsidiary  Jersey Standard changed its name to Exxon Corporation in 1972 and established Exxon as a trademark throughout the United States  In other parts of the world  Exxon and its affiliated companies continued to use its Esso trademark  On March 24  1989  the Exxon Valdez oil tanker struck Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound  Alaska and spilled more than 11 million US gallons  42 000 m3  of crude oil  The Exxon Valdez oil spill was the second largest in U S  history  and in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez incident  the U S  Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990  An initial award of  5 billion USD punitive was reduced to  507 5 million by the US Supreme Court in June 2008  and distributions of this award have commenced  In 1998  Exxon and Mobil signed a US 73 7 billion definitive agreement to merge and form a new company called Exxon Mobil Corporation  the largest company on the planet  After shareholder and regulatory approvals  the merger was completed on November 30  1999  The merger of Exxon and Mobil was unique in American history because it reunited the two largest companies of John D  Rockefeller s Standard Oil trust  Standard Oil Company of New Jersey Exxon and Standard Oil Company of New York Mobil  which had been forcibly separated by government order nearly a century earlier  This reunion resulted in the largest merger in US corporate history  In 2000  ExxonMobil sold a refinery in Benicia  California and 340 Exxon branded stations to Valero Energy Corporation  as part of an FTC mandated divestiture of California assets  ExxonMobil continues to supply petroleum products to over 700 Mobil branded retail outlets in California  In 2005  ExxonMobil s stock price surged in parallel with rising oil prices  surpassing General Electric as the largest corporation in the world in terms of market capitalization  At the end of 2005  it reported record profits of US  36 billion in annual income  up 42  from the previous year  the overall annual income was an all time record for annual income by any business  and included  10 billion in the third quarter alone  also an all time record income for a single quarter by any business   The company and the American Petroleum Institute  the oil and chemical industry s lobbying organization  put these profits in context by comparing oil industry profits to those of other large industries such as pharmaceuticals and banking  13  14  On June 12  2008  ExxonMobil announced that it was transitioning out of the direct served retail market  citing the increasing difficulty of running gas stations under rising crude oil costs  The multi year process will gradually phase the corporation out of the direct served retail market  and will affect 820 company owned stations and approximately 1 400 other stations operated by dealers distributing across the United States  The sale has not resulted in the disappearance of Exxon and Mobil branded stations  the new owners will continue to sell Exxon and Mobil branded gasoline and license the appropriate names from ExxonMobil  who will in turn be compensated for use of the brands  15  In 2010  ExxonMobil bought XTO Energy  the company focused on development and production of unconventional resources  16  In terms of potential future developments  many gas and oil companies are considering the economic and environmental benefits of Floating Liquefied Natural Gas  FLNG   This is an innovative technology designed to enable the development of offshore gas resources that would otherwise remain untapped  because environmental or economic factors make it unviable to develop them via a land based LNG operation  ExxonMobil is waiting for an appropriate project to launch its FLNG development  17  and the only FLNG facility currently in development is being built by Shell  18  due for completion in around 2017  19  In 2012  ExxonMobil confirmed a deal for production and exploration activities in the Kurdistan region of Iraq  20   edit  Merger  edit  Pre deal events Exxon Mobil pre merger scope  1997 data  On June 16  1998  Mr  Lee R  Raymond  Exxon s CEO  met with Mr  Lucio A  Noto  Mobil s CEO  at Mobil s headquarters in Fairfax  Virginia  At the meeting  Mr  Raymond and Mr  Noto had preliminary

All these signaled that market positively assessed the merger as economically sound and value creating   edit  Regulators approval On September 29  1999 EU Commission granted its approval of the merger with requirement of vast divestitures and breakup of the European refining and marketing joint venture of BP Amoco and Mobil  Mobil wanted to maintain its relationship with BP Amoco  but EC officials feared that the recent rash of mega mergers could kill off downstream competition in member countries  Mobil was also ordered to sell its share in a large chain of gasoline stations  Aral   23  Exxon and Mobil sold part of their lubricant base oil manufacturing capacity  BP Amoco bought Mobil s 30  interest in their R amp M JV for  1 65 billion  about the value of the assets that Mobil contributed when the deal was established  Mobil also got around  1 08 billion for its interest in Aral  24  The US FTC announced on November 30  1999 that it accepted a proposed settlement of charges that Exxon Corp s acquisition of Mobil Corp would violate federal antitrust laws  The settlement required the largest retail divestiture in Commission history   the sale or assignment of approximately 2 431 Exxon and Mobil gas stations in the Northeast and Mid Atlantic  1 740   California  360   Texas  319  and Guam  12   In addition  an Exxon refinery in California  terminals  a pipeline and other assets were also subject for sale  25  Exxon Mobil ratios comparison  edit  Ratios overview Exxon and Mobil return on assets  1983 1999 Exxon had better return on assets  6 75   and return on equity  14 57   ratios  Mobil s were 3 95  and 9 01  correspondingly   This situation represented Exxon s better efficiency at using investment funds  shareholder s equity  to generate earnings growth  Exxon was more stable and effective in using its assets  while Mobil was more volatile and risky  During 1983 1999 Exxon was superior with the exception of 1989  when tanker Exxon Valdez disaster happened and cut profits of the company  Companies had equal gross margin  38 7  vs  38 52    but Exxon had higher gross operating margin  7 9   and profit margin  5 4   ratios than Mobil  6 56  and 3 18  correspondingly  which means that Exxon was better in cost cutting and controlling its expenses  But in some cases low operating expenses can damage long term profitability and competitiveness of the company  Liquidity ratios definitely show that both companies were financially stable  but Exxon was in better situation that Mobil  The Exxon s current and quick ratios  0 57 and 0 91 correspondingly  were higher than the Mobil s  0 48 and 0 67 correspondingly  and merged company had significantly improved these results  Ratio of net current assets as a   of total assets  i e  working capital to total assets  was distorted after the merger  1 48  probably due to large divestitures that followed the deal  Solvency status of companies also looked good  Though Exxon again showed its financial supremacy with much higher interest coverage ratio  93 41 compared to Mobil s 7 78  Generally speaking the better interest coverage ratio means less risk but also might be bad for future performance because of the failure of the management to use additional funds for development  Debt to equity ratio was safe and stable in both companies  Combined company showed even superior results after the merger  which proved the correlation between positive market reaction on the announcement event and success of the merger   edit  Deal structure Under the merger agreement  an Exxon subsidiary would merge into Mobil so that Mobil becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon Mobil  As a result  Exxon would hold 100  of Mobil s issued and outstanding voting securities  Holders of Mobil common stock would receive 1 32015 shares of Exxon common stock for each share of Mobil common stock  21  Exxon Mobil deal structure 5 days before the announcement Exxon shares price was  72 and 2 431 million shares outstanding   175 billion market value  compared with  75 25 a share and 779 8 million shares outstanding for Mobil   58 7 billion market value   With the exchange ratio 1 32015  Exxon paid 1 029 4 million its shares for Mobil or  74 1 billion  This was a  15 4 billion  26 2   premium over Mobil s market value or  94 9 a share  After the price run up Exxon shareholders would own approximately 70  of the combined Exxon Mobil entity  while Mobil shareholders would own approximately 30   The merger qualified as a tax free reorganization in the US  and that it was accounted for on a  pooling of interests  basis  21  In addition  the merger agreement provided for payment of termination fees of  1 5 billion  Exxon and Mobil also entered into an option agreement that granted Exxon the option to purchase up to 136 5 million shares  14 9   of Mobil common stock at a strike price of  95 96  Exxon could exercise the option after the occurrence of an event  entitling Exxon to receive the termination fee payable by Mobil  21  The termination fee and option were intended to make it more likely that the merger would be completed on the agreed terms and to discourage proposals for alternative business combinations  Among other effects  the option could prevent an alternative business combination with Mobil from being accounted for as a  pooling of interests   Although companies introduced protection against hostile takeover  they didn t use any collar to protect shareholders  J P  Morgan  amp  Co  and Davis  Polk  amp  Wardwell advised Exxon  and Goldman Sachs  amp  Co  and Skadden  Arps  Meagher  amp  Flom advised Mobil  21   edit  Valuation J P  Morgan performed traditional P E analysis  Such analysis indicated that Mobil had been trading at an 8  to 15  discount to Exxon  J P  Morgan s analysis indicated that if Mobil were to be valued at price to earnings multiples comparable to those of Exxon  there would be an enhancement of value to its shareholders of approximately  11 billion  21  Goldman Sachs also reviewed and compared ratios and public market multiples relating to Mobil to following six publicly traded companies  21  British Petroleum Company plc  Chevron Corporation  Exxon  Royal Dutch Petroleum Company  Shell Transport  amp  Trading Co  plc  Texaco Inc  P E multiple for these firms ranged 19 3 23 8  The analysis showed that Mobil was undervalued 5 16  relative to comparables with fair price  79 89 a share  It s needed to notice that comparables analysis couldn t capture the synergy effect  value creation and differences  Simple DCF analysis of Mobil as a standalone company gives range of intrinsic value of  59 8 79 5 billion or  76 7 102 per share depending on cash flow growth rate  21  DCF analysis  based on the estimated pre tax synergies of  2 8 billion expected to result from the merger  suggested a potential value creation in the short term of approximately  22 25 billion  J P  Morgan s review suggested that over the long term  the potential for value creation from these elements could be as much as  47 57 billion  So Mobil intrinsic value for this deal was  95  118 8 a share depending on growth rate  21  Summary of Exxon Mobil merger valuation Since Exxon s market capitalization was significantly larger than Mobil s  Exxon s shareholders would have enjoyed a greater proportion of the value creation if no premium were paid by Exxon in the merger  By offering a premium to Mobil s shareholders  this potential value creation was instead shared in approximately equal proportions between the companies  shareholders and such sharing was deemed to be a reasonable allocation of value creation  J P  Morgan s analysis showed that for transactions involving smaller companies with a relative market capitalization comparable to that of Mobil pre announcement  a premium of 15  to 25  matched market precedent  In comparison  BP paid 35  premium for Amoco  10 days before the completion of the merger  Exxon market value was  184 5 billion   76 a share  and Mobil    77 1 billion   98 5 a share   Pro forma market value of merged company was  261 6 billion  Right after the merger was completed  the share price of combined Exxon Mobil was  80 56 with 3 461 5 million shares outstanding  which gave  278 8 billion market value or  17 2 billion of additional value created  This figure would be even higher if we consider pre announcement pro forma combined market value of  233 7 billion  In this case created value reaches  45 1 billion  21   edit  Synergy The motivations for the Exxon Mobil merger reflected the industry forces  Companies needed a secure presence in the regions with high potential for oil gas discoveries and stronger position to make large investments  The benefits of the merger fell broadly in two categories  near term operating synergies and capital productivity improvements  21  Near term operating synergies   2 8 billion in annual pre tax benefits from operating synergies  increases in production  sales and efficiency  decreases in unit costs and combining complementary operations   Management expected to realize the full benefits by the third year after the merger  During the first two years  the benefits should had been partly offset by one time costs at  2 billion for business integration  The firms also planned to eliminate about 9 000 jobs  A year later  pre tax annual savings were re assessed and increased to  3 8 billion  26  Capital productivity improvements  Management also believed the combined company could use its capital more profitably than either company on its own  These improvements were realized due to efficiencies of scale  cost savings  and sharing of best management practices  The businesses and assets of Exxon and Mobil were highly complementary in key areas  In the exploration and production area  for example  Mobil s and Exxon s respective strengths in West Africa  the Caspian region  Russia  South America  and North America lined up well  with minimal overlap  The firms also had a presence in natural gas  with combined sales of about 14 bcfd  And Mobil contributed its LNG assets and experience to the venture  21  There were technology synergies as well  In upstream  Exxon and Mobil owned proprietary technologies in the areas of  deepwater and arctic operations  heavy oil  gas to liquids processing  LNG  and high strength steel  In downstream  their proprietary technology focused on refining and chemical catalysts  Exxon s lube base stocks production fitted well with Mobil s leadership in lubes marketing  21  Generally  the Exxon Mobil deal was a move by the dominant partner to increase its asset base by 30  while raising capital productivity   edit

million pounds in 2005  and toxicity of the emissions  41  In 2005  ExxonMobil had committed less than 1  of their profits towards researching alternative energy  42  less than other leading oil companies  43   edit  Exxon Valdez oil spill Main article  Exxon Valdez oil spill The March 24  1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill resulted in the discharge of approximately 11 million US gallons  42 000 m3  of oil into Prince William Sound  44  oiling 1 300 miles  2 100 km  of the remote Alaskan coastline  The State of Alaska s Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council stated that the spill  is widely considered the number one spill worldwide in terms of damage to the environment   44  but many larger spills have occurred  Exxon was widely criticized for its slow response to cleaning up the disaster  John Devens  the Mayor of Valdez  has said his community felt betrayed by Exxon s inadequate response to the crisis  45  Exxon later removed the name  Exxon  from its tanker shipping subsidiary  which it renamed  SeaRiver Maritime   The renamed subsidiary  though wholly Exxon controlled  has a separate corporate charter and board of directors  and the former Exxon Valdez is now the SeaRiver Mediterranean  The renamed tanker is legally owned by a small  stand alone company  which would have minimal ability to pay out on claims in the event of a further accident  46  After a trial  a jury ordered Exxon to pay  5 billion in punitive damages  though an appeals court reduced that amount by half  Exxon appealed further  and on June 25  2008  the United States Supreme Court lowered the amount to  500 million  47  In 2009  Exxon still uses more single hull tankers than the rest of the largest ten oil companies combined  including the Valdez s sister ship  the SeaRiver Long Beach  48   edit  Exxon s Brooklyn oil spill Main article  Greenpoint oil spill New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced on July 17  2007 that he had filed suit against the Exxon Mobil Corporation and ExxonMobil Refining and Supply Company to force cleanup of the oil spill at Greenpoint  Brooklyn  and to restore Newtown Creek  49  A study of the spill released by the US Environmental Protection Agency in September 2007 reported 50  that the spill consists of 17 to 30 million US gallons  64 000 to 110 000 m3  of petroleum products from the mid 19th century to the mid 20th century  51  The largest portion of these operations were by ExxonMobil or its predecessors  By comparison  the Exxon Valdez oil spill was approximately 11 million US gallons  42 000 m3   44  The study reported that in the early 20th century Standard Oil of New York operated a major refinery in the area where the spill is located  The refinery produced fuel oils  gasoline  kerosene and solvents  Naptha and gas oil  secondary products  were also stored in the refinery area  Standard Oil of New York later became Mobil  a predecessor to Exxon Mobil  52   edit  Yellowstone River oil spill Map of the Yellowstone River watershed The July 2011 Yellowstone River oil spill was an oil spill from an ExxonMobil pipeline running from Silver Tip to Billings  Montana  which ruptured about 10 miles west of Billings on July 1  2011 at about 11 30 p m  53  The resulting spill leaked an estimated 750 to 1 000 barrels of oil into the Yellowstone River for about 30 minutes before it was shut down  54  As a precaution against a possible explosion  officials in Laurel  Montana evacuated about 140 people on Saturday just after midnight  then allowed them to return at 4 a m  53  A spokesman for Exxon Mobil said that the oil is within 10 miles of the spill site  However  Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer disputed the accuracy of that figure  55  The governor pledged that  The parties responsible will restore the Yellowstone River   54   edit  Sakhalin I in the Russian Far East Main article  Sakhalin I Scientists and environmental groups voice concern that the Sakhalin I oil and gas project in the Russian Far East  operated by an ExxonMobil subsidiary  Exxon Neftegas Limited  ENL   56  57  threatens the critically endangered western gray whale population  58  59  60  In February  2009  independent scientists  convened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature issued an urgent call for a     moratorium on all industrial activities  both maritime and terrestrial  that have the potential to disturb gray whales in summer and autumn on and near their main feeding areas  following a sharp decline in observed whales in the main feeding area in 2008  adjacent to ENL s project area  61  The scientists also criticized ENL s unwillingness to cooperate with the scientific panel process  which  certainly impedes the cause of western gray whale conservation   62   edit  Funding of global warming skeptics ExxonMobil has been accused of paying to fuel skepticism of anthropogenic global warming  i e  the belief that an increase in the temperature of the earth s atmosphere is due to the greenhouse effect  caused primarily by increased levels of carbon dioxide released in the burning of coal and petroleum based fuels   63  64  ExxonMobil has drawn criticism from the environmental lobby for funding organizations critical of the Kyoto Protocol and skeptical of the scientific opinion that global warming is caused by the burning of fossil fuels  According to Mother Jones Magazine  the company channeled more than  8 million to forty different organizations that challenged the scientific evidence of global warming 65  and that the company was a member of one of the first such skeptic groups  the Global Climate Coalition  founded in 1989  65  According to The Guardian  ExxonMobil has funded  among other groups skeptical of global warming  the Competitive Enterprise Institute  George C  Marshall Institute  Heartland Institute  Congress on Racial Equality  TechCentralStation com  and International Policy Network  66  67  ExxonMobil s support for these organizations has drawn criticism from the Royal Society  the academy of sciences of the United Kingdom  68  The Union of Concerned Scientists released a report in 2007 accusing ExxonMobil of spending  16 million  between 1998 and 2005  towards 43 advocacy organizations which dispute the impact of global warming  69  The report argued that ExxonMobil used disinformation tactics similar to those used by the tobacco industry in its denials of the link between lung cancer and smoking  saying that the company used  many of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue   69  These charges are consistent with a purported 1998 internal ExxonMobil strategy memo  posted by the environmental group Environmental Defense  stating Victory will be achieved when Average citizens  and the media   understand   recognize  uncertainties in climate science  recognition of uncertainties becomes part of the  conventional wisdom    citation needed  Industry senior leadership understands uncertainties in climate science  making them stronger ambassadors to those who shape climate policy citation needed  Those promoting the Kyoto treaty on the basis of extant science appear out of touch with reality  70  ExxonMobil has been reported as having plans to invest up to US 100m over a ten year period in Stanford University s Global Climate and Energy Project  71  In August 2006  the Wall Street Journal revealed that a YouTube video lampooning Al Gore  titled Al Gore s Penguin Army  appeared to be astroturfing by DCI Group  a Washington PR firm with ties to ExxonMobil  72  73  In January 2007  the company appeared to change its position  when vice president for public affairs Kenneth Cohen said  we know enough now or  society knows enough now that the risk is serious and action should be taken   Cohen stated that  as of 2006  ExxonMobil had ceased funding of the Competitive Enterprise Institute and   five or six  similar groups   74  While the company did not publicly state which the other similar groups were  a May 2007 report by Greenpeace does list the five groups it stopped funding as well as a list of 41 other climate skeptic groups which are still receiving ExxonMobil funds  75  On February 13  2007  ExxonMobil CEO Rex W  Tillerson acknowledged that the planet was warming while carbon dioxide levels were increasing  but in the same speech gave an unqualified defense of the oil industry and predicted that hydrocarbons would dominate the world s transportation as energy demand grows by an expected 40 percent by 2030  Tillerson stated that there is no significant alternative to oil in coming decades  and that ExxonMobil would continue to make petroleum and natural gas its primary products  76  saying   I m no expert on biofuels  I don t know much about farming and I don t know much about moonshine      There is really nothing ExxonMobil can bring to that whole biofuels issue  We don t see a direct role for ourselves with today s technology   77  However  recently Exxonmobil has announced that it will plan on spending up to 600 million dollars within the next 10 years to fund biofuels that come from algae  On July 14  2010 Exxonmobil announced that  a year after teaming with Synthetic Genomics  Inc   they had opened a greenhouse to research algae as a possible biofuel  78  A survey carried out by the UK s Royal Society found that in 2005 ExxonMobil distributed  2 9m to 39 groups that the society said  misrepresented the science of climate change by outright denial of the evidence   79  On July 1  2009  The Guardian newspaper revealed that ExxonMobil has continued to fund organizations including the National Center for Policy Analysis  NCPA  along with the Heritage Foundation  despite a public pledge to cut support of lobby groups who deny climate change  80   edit  Criticism  edit  Funding of climate change skepticism A recent analysis by Carbon Brief from 2011 concluded that 9 out of 10 climate scientists who claim that climate change is not happening  have ties to ExxonMobil  The results showed that out of the 938 papers cited by climate sceptics  186 of them were written by only ten men  and foremost among them was Dr Craig D  Idso  who personally authored 67 of them  Idso is the president of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change  an ExxonMobil funded think tank  The second most prolific was Dr Patrick Michaels  a senior fellow at the Cato Institute  who receives roughly 40  of his funding from the oil industry  This goes in parallel with the work of the Koch industries  Koch industries is the second largest privately held company in the US  and in the past 50 years  they have invested more than 50 000 000 dollars in spreading awareness of research which discredits global warming  according to Greenpeace  81  82  83   edit  Environment The Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound  Alaska  on March 24  1989  was a watershed moment for environmental critics of the oil industry   edit  Foreign business practices Investigative reporting by Forbes Magazine raised questions about ExxonMobil s dealings with the leaders of oil rich nations  ExxonMobil controls concessions covering 11 million acres  45 000 km2  off the coast of Angola that hold an estimated 7 5 billion barrels  1 19 109 m3  of crude  84  In 2003  the Office of Foreign Assets Control reported that ExxonMobil engaged in illegal trade with Sudan and it  along with dozens of other companies  settled with the United States government for  50 000  85  In March 2003  James Giffen of the Mercator Corporation was indicted  accused of bribing President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan with  78 million to help ExxonMobil win a 25 percent share of the Tengiz oilfield  the third largest in the world  On April 2  2003  former Mobil executive J  Bryan Williams was indicted on tax charges relating to this same transaction  The case is the largest under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act  86  This series of events is depicted in the film Syriana  In a U S  Department of Justice release dated September 18  2003  the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced that J  Bryan Williams  a former senior executive of Mobil Oil Corporation  had been sentenced to three years and ten months in prison on charges of evading income taxes on more than  7 million in unreported income   including a  2 million kickback he received in connection with Mobil s oil business in Kazakhstan   According to documents filed with the court  Williams  unreported income included millions of dollars in kickbacks from governments  persons  and other entities with whom Williams conducted business while employed by Mobil  In addition to his sentence  Williams must pay a fine of  25 000 and more than  3 5 million in restitution to the IRS  in addition to penalties and interest  87   edit  Human rights Main article  ExxonMobil violations in Indonesia ExxonMobil is the target of human rights activists for actions taken by the corporation in the Indonesian territory of Aceh  In June 2001 a lawsuit against ExxonMobil was filed in the Federal District Court of the District of Columbia under the Alien Tort Claims Act  The suit alleges that the ExxonMobil knowingly assisted human rights violations  including torture  murder and rape  by employing and providing material support to Indonesian military forces  who committed the alleged offenses during civil unrest in Aceh  Human rights complaints involving Exxon s  Exxon and Mobil had not yet merged  relationship with the Indonesian military first arose in 1992  the company denies these accusations and filed a motion to dismiss the suit  which was denied in 2008 by a federal judge  88  but then dismissed in August 2009 by a different federal judge  89  The dismissal is currently under appeal   edit  LGBT When Exxon Corporation merged with Mobil Corporation in 1999  the newly merged company ended enrollment in Mobil Corporation s domestic partner benefits for same sex partners of employees  and it rescinded formal prohibitions against discrimination based on sexual orientation by removing it from the company s Equal Employment Opportunity policy  90  In 2010 the Human Rights Campaign  an LGBT lobbying group and political action committee  gave Exxon Mobil a score of  0  in its Corporate Equality Index  a scorecard that rated 590 companies on several criteria including diversity training that covers gender identity issues  transgender inclusive medical coverage including surgical procedures  and  positively engaging the external LGBT community   91  On May 26  2010 ExxonMobil shareholders voted down LGBT benefits for its employees   only 22  of shareholders voted yes for the issue  92   edit  Headquarters ExxonMobil s headquarters are located in Irving  Texas  93  A picture of the  Project Delta  construction site in Spring  TX  just north of Houston  TX   Credits   Construction Citizen As of January 2010  the company is conducting an internal study regarding possible consolidation of facilities to the northern Houston suburb of Spring  at the intersection of Interstate 45 and the Hardy Toll Road  Architectural documents obtained by the Houston Chronicle outline an elaborate corporate campus  including twenty office buildings totaling 3 000 000 square feet  280 000 m2   a wellness center  laboratory  and multiple parking garages  94  Alan Jeffers  a spokesperson for the company  did not say whether the consolidation study includes the Irving headquarters  but definitely includes the Fairfax headquarters  Chris Wallace  the chief executive of the Greater Irving Las Colinas Chamber of Commerce  said that he believed that it does include the headquarters  95  In October 2010 the company stated that it would not move its headquarters to Greater Houston  96  Since then  the corporation has acknowledged a move to a suburb between The Woodlands  TX and Spring  TX  This campus will be built to house 8 000 employees  and will be an environment that is suitable for work  play  and life  Beginning early in 2014  and ending some time in 2015  employees will move into the campus and begin work  ExxonMobil hopes to install this as its permanent corporate headquarters   97   edit  See also Dallas Fort Worth portal Companies portal Energy portal United States portal Baton Rouge Refinery  in Louisiana  United States  Exxon
