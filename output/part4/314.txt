Dave Cockrum  Storm is flying in the top right hand corner  Storm first appeared in 1975 in the famous Giant Size X Men  1 comic  written by Len Wein and pencilled by Dave Cockrum  In this comic  Wein uses a battle against the living island Krakoa to replace the first generation X Men of the 1960s with new X Men  5  Storm was an amalgamation of several characters Cockrum intended to use for the Legion of Super Heroes  In a 1999 interview  Cockrum said that the original black female of the Legion would have been called The Black Cat  According to him  she had Storm s costume  but without the cape  and a catlike haircut with tufts for ears  However  other female cat characters like Tigra had appeared  so Cockrum redesigned his new character  giving her white hair and the cape  creating Storm  When colleagues remarked that Storm s white hair made her look like a grandmother  and thus  presumably unpopular  he just said   Trust me   6  Chris Claremont  who followed up Wein as the writer of the flagship title Uncanny X Men in 1975  embraced Storm and started writing many notable X Men stories  among them God Loves  Man Kills and Dark Phoenix Saga  which respectively served as the basis for the films X2  X Men United and X Men  The Last Stand  In both arcs  Storm is written as a major supporting character  This was a wikt harbringer  as Claremont stayed the main writer of that comic book for the next 16 years and consequently wrote most of the publications containing Storm   edit  Backstory In Uncanny X Men  102  December 1976   Claremont established Storm s backstory  Ororo s mother  N Dare  is the princess of a tribe in Kenya and descended from of a long line of African witch priestesses with white hair  blue eyes  and a natural gift for sorcery  N Dare falls in love with and marries American photojournalist David Munroe  They move to Harlem in uptown New York City  where Ororo is born  They move to Egypt and lived there until they die during the Suez Crisis in a botched aircraft attack  leaving six year old Ororo as an orphan  Her violent claustrophobia is established as a result of being buried under tons of rubble after that attack  She becomes a skilled thief in Cairo under the benign Achmed el Gibar and wanders into the Serengeti as a young woman  She is worshipped as a goddess when her powers appear before being recruited by Professor X for the X Men  7  Claremont further fleshed out Storm s backstory in Uncanny X Men  117  January 1979   He retroactively added that Professor X  who recruits her in Giant Size X Men  1 of 1975  had already met her as a child in Cairo  As Ororo grows up on the streets and becomes a proficient thief under the tutelage of master thief Achmed el Gibar  one of her most notable victims was Charles Francis Xavier  later Professor X  He is able to use his mental powers to temporarily prevent her escape and recognizes the potential in her  However  when Xavier is attacked mentally by Amahl Farouk  the Shadow King  the two men are preoccupied enough with their battle to allow the girl to escape  Both Xavier and the Shadow King recognize Storm as the young girl later  8   edit  Punk revival  1980s  In the following issues  Claremont portrayed Storm as a serene  independent character  Although Storm was initially written having trouble adjusting to Western culture  e g  calling the obligation to cover herself up in a public bath  absurd   9  she earns a lot of respect  in Uncanny X Men  139  November 1980   Claremont established her as the leader of the X Men after Cyclops took a leave of absence  10  a position she holds in various incarnations  Claremont also made Storm especially harbor motherly feelings for the youngest X Man  13 year old Kitty Pryde  In Marvel Team Up  100  December 1980   Claremont wrote a short story in which he retroactively established that Storm  then 12 years old  saves a young Black Panther from racist thugs when they both are in Kenya  11  This story would later become a base for later writers to establish a deeper relationship between both characters  12  In X Men Annual  5  the X Men travel with the Fantastic Four to help Arkon the Imperion defeat lizard like Badoon invaders who had taken over his kingdom  Storm and Arkon share a kiss at the end of the issue  as she turns down his offer to make her his queen  In the early eighties  adventures of Storm written by Claremont included a space opera arc  in which the X Men fight parasitic beings called the Brood  Storm is infected with a Brood egg and contemplates suicide  but then experiences a last minute save by the benign whale like Acanti aliens  13  In the following arc  Claremont further established Storm s character strength  He wrote a story in which Storm s fellow X Man Angel is abducted by a rogue mutant group called the Morlocks  The X Men are hopelessly outnumbered  and Storm is rendered sick by the Morlock called Plague  Only one solution is left  an X Man must defeat the Morlock s leader Callisto in a duel to the death  At first  Storm s colleague  Nightcrawler  wants to battle her  but Storm states that since she leads the X Men  she must fight Callisto  Despite being violently sick  she defeats Callisto by impaling her through the heart and nearly kills her  14  Storm s debut in her punk look and attitude  Art by Paul Smith  who called it  a bad joke   15  In Uncanny X Men  173  October 1983  a notable move was made by changing Storm s costume and appearance  Writer Claremont and artist Paul Smith created a new look  abandoning her old costume for black leather top and pants  and changing her former veil of white hair into a punk Mohawk  16  In a 2008 interview  Smith regretted the change as  a bad joke gone too far     I knew that they were going to cut the hair  so as a joke I put a Mr  T mohawk on her      editor  Louise Simonson said  We re gonna get hung  sic  no matter what we do  so let s commit the crime   So we went with the Mohawk     But once you get into the whole leather and stud thing it was a bad joke that got way out of hand   15  In the actual story  Storm s outlook on life darkens after her struggles with the Brood  These changes alienate her from Kitty for a time  Storm is influenced in this by Yukio  a friend of Wolverine  and the two become fast friends  17  Claremont wrote an arc in which fellow mutant Forge develops a mutant power neutralizing gun  The intended target is another X Man  Rogue  who because of her criminal history and a recent encounter with some S H I E L D  agents  is believed to be a terrorist  When the shady U S  government operative Henry Peter Gyrich aims at Rogue  he accidentally hits Storm  taking away her powers  Forge saves Storm from death and takes her back to his home in Dallas  Texas to recover  With his help  she adjusts to life without her powers  and they slowly fall in love  Later  Storm overhears a phone conversation between Forge and Gyrich  and discovers Forge built the weapon that took her powers  She is heartbroken and leaves him  18  However  Claremont continued to write her as a strong character  letting a depowered Storm win against Cyclops for the leadership of the X Men in Uncanny X Men  201  1986   19  In the late eighties  Claremont wrote arcs in which Storm  again portrayed with a costume and hairstyle closer to her original  temporarily joins the insidious Hellfire Club  1987   20  is trapped in another dimension with Forge and regains her elemental powers  21  and is captured by the evil cyborg Nanny  22  Although believed slain in that encounter  she resurfaced  having become amnesiac as a result of being physically regressed to childhood by Nanny  She is hunted by the evil telepath Shadow King and framed for murder  23  and finally returns to thieving before regaining her memories  24  In the following arc  The X Tinction Agenda  she is kidnapped to the mutant exploiting fictional nation of Genosha and is temporarily transformed into a brainwashed mutate  but is in the end restored physically and mentally to her adult prime  25   edit  Growth as a character  1990s  In October 1991  the X Men franchise was re launched  centering on the new eponymous X Men  vol  2  comic  Claremont wrote Storm as the leader of the X Men s Gold Team  the other team  Blue  is led by her colleague Cyclops  the X Man she once succeeded as leader  When Claremont left the X Men comic after 16 years since his debut in Uncanny X Men  94  1975   26  he was replaced by Jim Lee  who continued portraying her as a strong leader  In the sister title Uncanny X Men  now under Scott Lobdell  Lobdell continued on the romance between Storm and Forge eventually having Forge propose to Storm in 1992  Storm hesitates and is about to say yes when Forge misinterprets her reaction and rescinds his offer before Storm can speak  27  Lobdell waited until November 1993 before he let a deeply hurt Storm and Forge make up with each other  28  In 1995  Lobdell continued with an arc which pitted the X Men against the Morlocks again  As Claremont did with Callisto in 1983  Lobdell let Storm end the battle by wounding her opponent in the heart  This time  Storm rips out one heart of the two hearted Morlock girl Marrow  who had fixed a bomb to it  29  In February 1996  Storm got her first miniseries  the eponymous Storm  In these four issues  Warren Ellis wrote a story in which Storm is sucked into an alternate dimension and pitted against villain Mikhail Rasputin  30   edit  Contemporary Storm  2000s  In X Treme X Men  conceived by a newly reinstated Chris Claremont in July 2001  Storm was written as the leader of this team of more streetwise X Men  including the former thief Gambit  former Brotherhood member Rogue  Sage  anti hero Bishop  Psylocke  and the more tame third hero known as Thunderbird  This was in contrast to its more strait laced sister titles  Uncanny X Men and New X Men  In the period until its end in issue  46  June 2004   Claremont continued to write Storm as the central character  During this time  Storm enjoys a brief flirtation with younger fellow X Man Slipstream and is kidnapped by the intergalactic warlord Khan  Khan wants to make her his queen  but Storm defeats him  In the series  she also becomes leader of the fictional X Treme Sanctions Executive  a special police task force of mutants policing mutants given worldwide authority  31  In the aftermath of the 2005 House of M storyline  written by Brian Michael Bendis   90  of the mutants lost their powers  Storm is among the 198 mutants who retain their powers  32  Also in that year  the miniseries Ororo  Before the Storm of Mark Sumerak retold her backstory in greater detail  concentrating on her relationship with surrogate father figure Achmed el Gibar during her childhood  33  The marriage of Storm and the Black Panther  Front cover for Black Panther  18  2006   by Frank Cho  In the following year  Marvel Comics announced that Ororo would marry fellow African super hero Black Panther  Collaborating writer Eric Jerome Dickey explained that it was a move to explicitly target the female and African American audience  34  Storm s history with Black Panther  including the initial meeting of the characters  was retconned by Marvel during the lead up to their marriage  Initially  in Marvel Team Up  100  1980   Storm is seen at age twelve rescuing Black Panther from a white racist called Andreas de Ruyter  11  but in Dickey s miniseries  T Challa saves Ororo  who is still twelve  from de Ruyter and his brother  A Black Panther  24  2006  flashback is ambiguous when it comes to the physical aspect of their first meeting  while the miniseries depicts Ororo losing her virginity to T Challa a few days after they meet  35  Collaborating writer Axel Alonso  editor of Black Panther  has stated   Eric s story  for all intents and purposes       is Ororo s origin story   12  The relationship led to the marriage of the two most prominent black African Marvel Comics heroes in Black Panther  18 by writer Reginald Hudlin  July 2006  as a tie in to the Civil War storyline  36  Marvel Comics editor in chief Joe Quesada was highly supportive of this marriage  stating it was the Marvel Comics equivalent of the marriage of  Lady Diana and Prince Charles   and he expected both characters to emerge strengthened  37  Shawn Dudley  the Emmy Award Winning Costume Designer for TV s Guiding Light designed Storm s wedding dress  which was revealed in the April 17 issue of TV Guide  though the design was greatly altered for the comic event  38  Quesada s prediction has begun to be born out in a Black Panther story arc that followed Storm and T Challa s wedding where the newly married couple go on a World Tour  meeting with other known royalties such as Doctor Doom  Namor  and Black Bolt of the Inhumans  With Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman taking time off to work on their marriage in the aftermath of the Civil War  Storm and Black Panther become temporary members of the Fantastic Four alongside the Human Torch and the Thing in 2007  39  Storm later returned to the Uncanny X Men  40  Storm later joins the reformed Astonishing X Men   25   She states that her official reason for joining the team is that Wakanda is a supporter of Mutantes Sans Frontieres and she believes she should be on the front line  however she is also somewhat bored of her life as queen  The reemergence of the Shadow King later forces Storm to choose between her role as queen and her role as an X Man  Confronting the Panther God Bast  Storm asserts that she is not limited to being one or the other or anything else and that she is unafraid to do whatever is necessary to fulfill those responsibilities  Regaining Bast s favor  the two defeat the Shadow King and Storm decides that she will remain Queen of Wakanda and remain with the X Men  refusing to choose between them  41  Seeking to re learn his limitations  T Challa later leaves Africa and takes a new role as the guardian of Hell s Kitchen following the events of Shadowland  Though the two remain a couple  Storm sadly but respectfully accepts T Challa s request for temporary isolation so that he can find himself  volume  amp  issue needed  It was announced on October 15  2011 that Storm

the debut of the X Men series coincided with the African American Civil Rights Movement  1955 1968   in which their plight as mutants mirrored that of African Americans  43  Storm s creation in particular  was during the heyday of blaxploitation films  which featured  among others  Pam Grier  an African American actress who is considered a pioneer in female action hero films   43   edit  Fictional character biography Ever since her inception in 1975  Storm s biography has largely stayed the same  The framework was laid first by Chris Claremont  who fleshed out her backstory in Uncanny X Men  102  1976  7  and Uncanny X Men  117  1979   8  Some reinterpretations were made in 2005 and 2006  where writers Mark Sumerak and Eric Jerome Dickey  respectively  rewrote part of her early history in the miniseries Ororo  Before the Storm 33  and Storm  vol  2   44  According to established Marvel canon  Ororo Munroe is born in New York City as the child of Kenyan tribal princess N Dare and American photographer David Munroe  When Ororo is six months old  she and her parents move to the Egyptian capital of Cairo  Five years later  during the Suez Crisis  a fighter jet crashes into her parents  house  killing them  Buried under tons of rubble  Ororo survives but is orphaned and left with intense claustrophobia  Her fear was once so intense that she was known to revert to a fetal position and approach a catatonic state  7   In recent years  Storm has more or less conquered her claustrophobia  45  and can freely move in tight spaces  even over long periods of time  46   After the death of her parents  Ororo wanders Cairo s back alleys for a few weeks  until she is picked up by the benign street lord Achmed el Gibar and becomes a prolific thief  33  among her victims is her future mentor Professor X who is there to meet the Shadow King  8  Following an inner urge  she wanders into the Serengeti as a teenager and meets T Challa  who would become her future husband  Despite strong mutual feelings  the two part ways  11  44  In the Serengeti  Ororo first displays her mutant ability to control the weather  Sometime after this  she met the witch priestess  Ainet  who took her in and became her surrogate mother  Once  when their village was going through a terrible drought  Storm commanded rain for days just to help them  By doing this  she threw off the natural order of nature  and draughts were formed over numerous villages  and hundreds of animals were killed  Sensing the damage she had done  Ainet told Storm of her kind  but ill thought out gesture  and of the damage she caused  Ainet took this opportunity to explain to Ororo how her powers worked with nature  and how she could fix the problem by properly distributing rain  47  For a time  she is worshipped as a rain goddess to an African tribe  practicing nudism and tribal spirituality  before being recruited by Professor X into the X Men  Ororo receives the code name  Storm  and is established as a strong  serene character  5  In her early career with the X Men  she suffers a major claustrophobic attack  which prompts a revelation of her origin to her teammates  48  When Magneto captures the team  Storm frees the X Men from captivity  49  Storm is later captured by the White Queen  50  leading up to the X Men s clash with Dark Phoenix  51  She becomes deputy leader of the X Men  52  and supplants her colleague Cyclops as leader of the X Men  10  a role she fills out during most of her time as a superhero  She briefly became  Rogue Storm   53  and even switched bodies with the White Queen  54  She is attacked by Dracula  55  and defeats Callisto  becoming the new leader of the Morlocks  56  Following her leadership of the Morlocks through combat with Callisto  Storm begins to develop a darker side  Eventually  the X Men are invited to Japan for Wolverine s wedding to Mariko Yashida  It is here that she meets Wolverine s old friend Yukio  and the two become fast friends  Storm is inspired by Yukio  who encourages Storm to embrace her emerging darker side  This leads Storm to drastically change her outward appearance to match her inner self and thus don her iconic punk drab  57  Storm is eventually deprived of her superhuman powers by a gun fired by Henry Peter Gyrich  unknown to her  this device was designed by the mutant inventor Forge  58  The depowered Ororo then first meets and falls in love with Forge  although he does not initially tell her that he is responsible for her power loss  59  She helps Forge battle Dire Wraiths  60

and is finally returned to adulthood   however  she is enslaved by the Genoshans  but regains her free will and escapes captivity  70  Concerning her personal life  she is for a long time romantically involved with fellow X Man Forge  and even considers marrying him before breaking up  27  After 90  of the mutants of the world lose their powers  Storm leaves the X Men to go to Africa  rekindles her relationship with T Challa  now a superhero known as Black Panther  marries him  and becomes the queen of the kingdom of Wakanda 36  and joins the new Fantastic Four alongside her husband when Reed and Sue take a vacation  71  On a mission in space  the Watcher told Black Panther and Storm that their children would have a special destiny  72  Upon Reed and Sue s return to the Fantastic Four  Storm and the Black Panther leave  with Storm returning to the Uncanny X Men to help out with events in Messiah Complex  After joining with the X Men again  Storm is confronted by Cyclops over her position as an X Man and a Queen  Cyclops reminds her that she made him choose between family and duty before  and she needs to make the same decision  Storm reacts by returning to Wakanda to face a despondent Black Panther  with the two seemingly falling out with each other  although it is later revealed that the Black Panther has been possessed by the Shadow King  After incapacitating the possessed T Challa  Storm battled Cyclops  who had been mentally enthralled by the Shadow King to kill the other X Men  After being forced to drive him out by striking Cyclops through the chest with a massive lightning bolt  the Shadow King then took control of Storm  only to be devoured in vengeance by Bast  the Panther God  who had agreed to hide inside of Storm s mind in order to take revenge on the Shadow King for possessing T Challa  73   edit  Powers and abilities  edit  Weather control Storm is one of the most powerful mutants and has demonstrated a plethora of abilities  most of which are facets of her power to control the weather  74  Storm possesses the psionic ability to control all forms of weather over vast areas  She has been able to control both Earthly and extraterrestrial ecosystems on several occasions  She can control the temperature of the environment  control all forms of precipitation  humidity and moisture  at a molecular level   generate lightning and other electromagnetic atmospheric phenomena  and has demonstrated excellent control over atmospheric pressure  She can incite all forms of meteorological tempests  such as tornadoes  thunderstorms  blizzards  and hurricanes  75  as well as mist  She can dissipate such weather to form clear skies as well  Her precise control over the atmosphere allows her to create special weather effects  She can create precipitation at higher or lower altitudes than normal  make whirlwinds travel pointing lengthwise in any direction  channel ambient electromagnetism through her body to generate electric blasts  flash freeze objects and people  coalesce atmospheric pollutants into acid rain or toxic fog  and  along with her natural ability of flight  summon wind currents strong enough to support her weight to elevate herself to fly at high altitudes and speeds  Her control is so great that she can even manipulate the air in a person s lungs  She can also control the pressure inside the human inner ear  an ability she uses to cause intense pain  She can also bend light using moisture in the air and her manipulation of mist and fog to appear partially transparent  and in later comics  nearly invisible  Storm has also demonstrated the ability to control natural forces that include cosmic storms  solar wind  ocean currents  and the electromagnetic field  She has demonstrated the ability to separate water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen via electrolysis  allowing her to breathe underwater  76  While in outer space  she is able to affect and manipulate the interstellar and intergalactic mediums  Storm can alter her visual perceptions so as to see the universe in terms of energy patterns  detecting the flow of kinetic  thermal and electromagnetic energy behind weather phenomena and can bend this energy to her will  Storm has shown to be sensitive to the dynamics of the natural world  and her psionic powers over weather are affected by her emotions  One consequence of this connection to nature is that she often suppresses extreme feelings to prevent her emotional state from resulting in violent weather  She has sensed a diseased and dying tree on the X Mansion grounds  detected objects within various atmospheric mediums including water  and sensed the incorrect motion of a hurricane in the Northern Hemisphere and the gravitational stress on the tides by the Moon and Sun as well as the distortion of a planet s magnetosphere  77  Storm can view the Earth as weather patterns  and is able to precisely recognize her geographic position through interpretations of these patterns  78  Storm s mutant abilities are limited by her willpower and the strength of her body  Some Sentinels have considered Storm an Omega level mutant  79   edit  Magical potential Storm s ancestry supports the use of magic and witchcraft  80  Many of her ancestors were sorceresses and priestesses  Storm s matrilineal powers have even been linked to the real world Rain Queens of Balobedu  the region from which her Sorceress Supreme ancestor  Ayesha  hails  The Mystic Arcana series deals with Storm s ancestor Ashake  who worships the Egyptian goddess Ma at  also known as Oshtur   the mother of Agamotto  81  Oshtur appears to have strong favor for the bloodline of Ororo  volume  amp  issue needed  For some unknown reason  since the dawn of Atlantis  this line of African women has been given distinguishing features of white hair  blue eyes  and powerful magic potential  volume  amp  issue needed  Although Storm has not developed her magical potential  it has been hinted at  80  The Mystic Arcana series lists the characters with magic potential according to the Marvel Tarot deck  The Tarot asserts Storm as being  High Priestess   the First Tarot s choice one third of the time  The other draws were the Scarlet Witch and Agatha Harkness  These three characters split the High Priestess card equally  A timeline divergent Storm became the sorceress who taught sorcery to Magik and some of Storm s alternate universe selves possess considerable magical talent  82  On a separate note  it has been stated that Storm s spirit is so strong that she was able to host the consciousness of an avatar  or  manifestation body  83   of Eternity  in a gathering consisting of herself  Doctor Strange  Black Panther  Silver Surfer and the Fantastic Four  she and Doctor Strange were the only viable candidates  84   edit  Combat and thievery Storm is an expert thief  and a skilled  cunning and gifted hand to hand fighter  trained by Achmed el Gibar  Professor X  Wolverine and T Challa  the Black Panther  By using superior strategy  Storm has overcome physically stronger foes like Callisto and the Crimson Commando in hand to hand combat  Storm is an excellent marksman with handguns  and is proficient in the use of knives  Storm is also fluent in Russian  Arabic and Swahili  As part of her paraphernalia  Storm carries a set of lock picks  with which she has

inter dimensional transportation with the help of her lightning  74   edit  Physical abilities and trait Her body compensates for rapid decreases or increases in atmospheric pressure  86  She can see in near complete darkness and has superb dexterity  87  88  Storm has been described as having one of the strongest wills among the X Men  making her highly resistant to psychic attacks especially in tandem with electrical fields she creates around herself  Telepaths have found it difficult to track her down and probe her thoughts  Several of these traits are independent of her mutant status and are a result of her ancestry  Also  when utilizing her powers  Storm s eyes turn solid white  74  Storm s real name  Ororo  is translated in her tribal language as  Beauty    edit  Other versions Main
