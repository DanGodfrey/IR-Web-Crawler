1964 New York World s Fair From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search View of the 1964 New York World s Fair from the observation towers of the New York State Pavilion  the Unisphere is in the center  Shea Stadium background left  The 1964 1965 New York World s Fair was the third major world s fair to be held in New York City  1  Hailing itself as a  universal and international  exposition  the fair s theme was  Peace Through Understanding   dedicated to  Man s Achievement on a Shrinking Globe in an Expanding Universe   although American corporations dominated the exposition as exhibitors  The theme was symbolized by a 12 story high  stainless steel model of the earth called the Unisphere  2  The fair ran for two six month seasons  April 22 October 18  1964 and April 21 October 17  1965  Admission price for adults  13 and older  was  2 00 in 1964 but  2 50 in 1965  and  1 00 for children  2 12  both years  3  View of the New York World s Fair from the observation towers of the New York State Pavilion  the Unisphere is at the left The site  Flushing Meadows Corona Park in the borough of Queens  had also held the 1939 1940 New York World s Fair  It was one of the largest world s fairs to be held in the United States  occupying nearly a square mile  2 6 km   of land  The only larger fair was the 1939 fair  which occupied space that was filled in for the 1964 1965 exposition  Preceding these fairs was the 1853 54 New York s World s Fair  called the Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations  located on the site of Bryant Park in the borough of Manhattan  New York City  The fair is best remembered as a showcase of mid 20th century American culture and technology  The nascent Space Age  with its vista of promise  was well represented  More than 51 million people attended the fair  less than the hoped for 70 million  It remains a touchstone for New York area Baby Boomers  who visited the optimistic fair as children before the turbulent years of the Vietnam War  cultural changes  and increasing struggles for civil rights In many ways the fair symbolized a grand consumer show covering many products produced in America at the time for transportation  living  and consumer electronic needs in a way that would never be repeated at future world s fairs in North America  Most American companies from pen manufacturers to auto companies had a major presence  While this fair wasn t officially a BIE sanctioned world s fair  it should be recognised in history as the first exhibition of any classification that gave the attendee interaction with computer equipment  Many corporations demonstrated the use of mainframe computers  computer terminals with keyboards and CRT displays  Teletype machines  punch cards  and telephone modems in an era when computer equipment was kept in back offices away from the public  and many years before the Internet and home computers were at everyone s disposal  Contents 1 Controversial

New York businessmen who fondly remembered their childhood experiences at the 1939 New York World s Fair and wanted to provide that same experience for their children and grandchildren  citation needed  Thoughts of an economic boom to the city as the result of increased tourism was also a major reason for holding another fair 25 years after the 1939 1940 extravaganza  4  Then New York City mayor  Robert F  Wagner  Jr   commissioned Frederick Pittera  a producer of International fairs and exhibitions and author of the history of International Fairs  amp  Exhibitions for the Encyclopaedia Britannica and Compton Encyclopedia to prepare the first feasibility studies for the 1964 1965 New York World s Fair  He was joined by Austrian Architect Victor Gruen  creator of the shopping mall  in studies that eventually led the Eisenhower Commission to award the world s fair to New York City in competition with a number of American cities  Souvenir bag art Organizers turned to private financing and the sale of bonds to pay the huge costs to stage them  The organizers hired New York s  Master Builder   Robert Moses  to head the corporation established to run the fair because he was experienced in raising money for vast public projects  Moses had been a formidable figure in the city since coming to power in the 1930s  He was responsible for the construction of much of the city s highway infrastructure and  as parks commissioner for decades  the creation of much of the city s park system  In the mid 1930s  Moses oversaw the conversion of a vast Queens tidal marsh garbage dump into the fairgrounds that hosted the 1939 1940 World s Fair  5  Called Flushing Meadows Park  it was Moses  grandest park scheme  He envisioned this vast park  comprising some 1 300 acres  5 km   of land and located in the center of the city  as a major recreational playground for New Yorkers  When the 1939 1940 World s Fair ended in financial failure  Moses did not have the available funds to complete work on his project  He saw the 1964 1965 Fair as a means to finish what the earlier fair had begun  6  To ensure profits to complete the park  fair organizers knew they would have to maximize receipts  An attendance of 70 million people would be needed to turn a profit and  for attendance that large  the fair would need to be held for two years  The World s Fair Corporation also decided to charge site rental fees to all exhibitors who wished to construct pavilions on the grounds  This decision caused the fair to come into conflict with the Bureau of International Expositions  BIE   the international body headquartered in Paris that sanctions world s fairs  BIE rules stated that an international exposition could run for one six month period only  and no rent could be charged to exhibitors  In addition  the rules allowed only one exposition in any given country within a 10 year period  and the Seattle World s Fair had already been sanctioned for 1962  5  The United States was not a member of the BIE at the time  but fair organizers understood that a sanction by the BIE would assure that its nearly 40 member nations would participate in the fair  Moses  undaunted by the rules  journeyed to Paris to seek official approval for the New York fair  When the BIE balked at New York s bid  Moses  used to having his way in New York  angered the BIE delegates by taking his case to the press  publicly stating his disdain for the BIE and its rules  5  The BIE retaliated by formally requesting its member nations not to participate in the New York fair  5  The 1939 1940 and 1964 1965 New York World s Fairs were the only significant world s fairs since the formation of the BIE to be held without its endorsement   edit  International participation View of the Unisphere with world flags The BIE decision was nearly a disaster for the fair  The absence of Canada  Australia  most of the major European nations and the Soviet Union  all members of the BIE  tarnished the image of the fair  5  Additionally  New York was forced to compete with both Seattle and Montreal for international participants  with many nations choosing the officially sanctioned world s fairs of those cities over the New York Fair  The fair turned to trade and tourism organizations within many countries to host national exhibits in lieu of official government sponsorship of pavilions  New York City  in the middle of the 20th century  was at a zenith of economic power and world prestige  Unconcerned by BIE rules  nations with smaller economies  as well as private groups in  or relevant to  some BIE members 7  8  9  10  11   saw it as an honor to host an exhibit at the Fair  citation needed  Therefore smaller nations and third world countries made up the majority of the international participation  Spain  12 Vatican City  13 Japan  14 Mexico  15 Sweden  16 Austria  17 Denmark  18 Thailand  19 Philippines  20 Greece  21  and Pakistan  22  to name some  hosted national presences at the Fair  The West Berlin Pavilion One of the fair s most popular exhibits was the Vatican Pavilion  where Michelangelo s Piet  was displayed  and a small plaza marking the spot  and Pope Paul VI s visit in October 1965  remains there  A copy was transported beforehand to ensure that the statue could be conveyed without being damaged  This copy is on view at St  Joseph s Seminary  Dunwoodie  in Yonkers  A recreation of a medieval Belgian village proved very popular  Fairgoers were treated to the  Bel Gem Brussels Waffle  a combination of waffle  strawberries and whipped cream  sold by a Brussels couple  Maurice Vermersch and his wife  23  Fairgoers could also enjoy sampling sandwiches from around the world at the popular Seven Up International Gardens Pavilion which featured the innovative fiberglass Seven Up Tower  24  25  While dining  visitors were treated to live performances of international music by the 7 Up Continental Band as well as musical selections from the Broadway stage  26  27  Emerging African nations displayed their wares in the Africa Pavilion  Controversy broke out when the Jordanian pavilion displayed a mural emphasizing the plight of the Palestinian people  The Jordanians also donated an ancient column which remains at their site  The city of West Berlin  a Cold War hot spot  hosted a popular display   edit  Federal and state exhibits The US Pavilion was titled  Challenge to Greatness  and focused on President Lyndon B  Johnson s  Great Society  proposals  The main show in the multi million dollar pavilion was a 15 minute ride through a filmed presentation of American history  Visitors seated in moving grandstands rode past movie screens that slid in  out and over the path of the traveling audience  Elsewhere  there were tributes to President John F  Kennedy  who had broken ground for the pavilion in December 1962 but had been assassinated in November 1963 before the fair opened  A 2 acre  8 100 m2  United States Space Park was sponsored by NASA  the Department of Defense and the fair  Exhibits included a full scale model of the aft skirt and five F 1 engines of the first stage of a Saturn V  a Titan II booster with a Gemini capsule  an Atlas with a Mercury capsule and a Thor Delta rocket  On display at ground level were Aurora 7  the Mercury capsule flown on the second US manned orbital flight  full scale models of an X 15 aircraft  an Agena upper stage  a Gemini spacecraft  an Apollo command service module  and a Lunar Excursion Model  Replicas of unmanned spacecraft included lunar probe Ranger VII  Mariner II and Mariner IV  Syncom  Telstar I  and Echo II communications satellites  Explorer I and Explorer XVI  and Tiros and Nimbus weather satellites  28  The Wisconsin Pavilion New York State played host to the fair at its six million dollar open air pavilion called the  Tent of Tomorrow   Designed by famed modernist architect Philip Johnson  the pavilion also boasted the fair s high spot observation towers  The main floor of the pavilion was a large scale design of a Texaco highway map of New York State  An idea floated after the fair to use the floor for the World Trade Center didn t materialize  Once the red ceiling tiles were removed from the pavilion in the late 1970s  the floor was subject to the elements of weather and was ruined  The 1964 1965 New York World s Fair New York State Pavilion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009  29  Wisconsin exhibited the  World s Largest Cheese   Florida brought a dolphin show  flamingos  a talented cockatoo from Miami s Parrot Jungle  and water skiers to New York  Oklahoma gave weary fairgoers a restful park to relax in  Missouri displayed the state s space related industries  Visitors could dine at Hawaii s  Five Volcanoes  restaurant  At the New York City pavilion  a huge scale model of the City of New York was on display complete with a simulated helicopter ride for easy viewing  Left over from the 1939 Fair  this building had also hosted the United Nations from 1947 1952   edit  American industry in the spotlight At the 1939 1940 World s Fair  industrial exhibitors played a major role by hosting huge  elaborate exhibits  Many of them returned to the 1964 1965 fair with even more elaborate versions of the shows they had presented twenty five years earlier  The most notable of these was General Motors Corporation whose Futurama  a show in which visitors seated in moving chairs glided past detailed scenery showing what life might be like in the  near future   proved to be the fair s most popular exhibit  Nearly 26 million people took the journey into the future during the fair s two year run  Concept car inside the General Motors Pavilion Other popular exhibits included that of the IBM Corporation  where a giant five hundred seat grandstand was pushed by hydraulic rams high up into a rooftop theater  There  a nine screen film by Charles and Ray Eames showed the workings of computer logic  IBM also demonstrated handwriting recognition on a 350 series mainframe computer running a program to look up what happened on a particular date that a person wrote down the first interaction for many with a computer  The Bell System hosted a 15 minute ride in moving armchairs depicting the history of communications in dioramas and film  Other Bell exhibits included the picture phone  to go on sale at the time of the fair  as well as a demonstration of the computer modem  DuPont presented a musical review by composer Michael Brown called  The Wonderful World of Chemistry   At Parker Pen  a computer would make a match to an international penpal  The Westinghouse Corporation planted a second time capsule next to the 1939 one  today both Westinghouse Time Capsules are marked by a monument southwest of the Unisphere which is to be opened in the year 6939  Some of its contents were a World s Fair Guidebook  an electric toothbrush  credit cards and a 50 star U S  flag  The Westinghouse Pavilion The Sinclair Oil Corporation sponsored Dinoland  featuring life size replicas of nine different dinosaurs  including the corporation s signature brontosaurus  After the fair closed  Dinoland spent a period of time as a traveling exhibit  After the traveling exhibit ended the Stegosaurus model was donated to Dinosaur National Monument and is still on display to this day  The fair was also a showplace for independent films  One of the most noted was a religious film titled Parable which showed at the Protestant Pavilion  It depicted humanity as a traveling circus and Christ as a clown  30  This marked the beginning of a new depiction of Jesus  31  and was the inspiration for the musical Godspell  Parable later went on to be honored at Cannes  as well as the Edinburgh Film Festival and Venice Film Festival  31  Another religious film was presented by the evangelist Billy Graham  who sponsored his own pavilion  The film Man in the 5th Dimension was shot in the 70mm Todd AO widescreen process for exclusive presentation in a specially designed theater equipped with audio equipment that enabled viewers to listen to the film in Chinese  French  German  Japanese  Russian and Spanish  32  The surprise hit of the fair was a non commercial movie short presented by the SC Johnson Company  S C  Johnson Wax  called To Be Alive  The film celebrated the joy of life found worldwide and in all cultures  and it would later win a special award from the New York Film Critics Circle and an Academy Award for Best Documentary  Short Subject   The Ford Motor Company introduced the Ford Mustang automobile to the public at its pavilion on April 17  1964   edit  Disney influence Fountains The fair also is remembered as the vehicle Walt Disney utilized to design and perfect the system of  Audio Animatronics   in which a combination of sound  mechanical electronics and computers controls the movement of lifelike robots to act out scenes  33 The Walt Disney Company designed and created four shows at the fair  In the Pepsi Presents WALT DISNEY S  it s a small world    a Salute to UNICEF and the World s Children attraction at the Pepsi pavilion  animated dolls and animals frolicked in a spirit of international unity on a boat ride around the world  The song was provided by the Sherman Brothers  Each of the animated dolls had an identical face  originally designed by New York  Valley Stream  artist Gregory S  Marinello in partnership with Walt Disney himself  General Electric sponsored  Progressland  where an audience seated in a revolving auditorium viewed an audio animatronic presentation of the progress of electricity in the home  The Sherman Brothers song  There s a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow  was composed for this attraction  The highlight of the exhibit demonstrated a brief plasma  explosion  of controlled nuclear fusion  The crowd pleasing loud crack that was produced could be heard even on the line outside in the neighboring Travelers Insurance pavilion  Ford Motor Company presented  Ford s Magic Skyway   an WED Imagineering designed pavilion  which was the second most popular exhibit at the fair  utilizing 50 motorless convertible Ford Mustangs in an early prototype of what would become the PeopleMover ride system to move the audience through scenes featuring life sized audio animatronic dinosaurs  which were later moved to the Disneyland Railroad Primeval World diorama  and cavemen  The Walt Disney Company had earlier been asked by General Motors to produce their exhibit  but they declined  citation needed  At the Illinois pavilion  a lifelike President Abraham Lincoln  voiced by Royal Dano  recited his famous speeches in  Great Moments with Mr  Lincoln   The Krofft s La Poupees de Paris Pavillion After the fair  there was some discussion of the Disney company retaining these exhibits on site and converting Flushing Meadows Park into an east coast version of Disneyland  citation needed  but this idea was abandoned  Instead  Disney relocated several of these exhibits to Disneyland and subsequently replicated them at other Disney theme parks  Walt Disney World is essentially the realization of the original concept of an  east coast Disneyland  with Epcot Center designed as a  permanent  world s fair  All four attractions are still represented in one way or another  Two attractions from the fair are relatively unchanged  including a replica of  it s a small world  and the original  albeit updated  Carousel of Progress  The two remaining attractions exist as evolutions of the originals  The dinosaurs from Ford s Magic Skyway became the Disneyland Railroad Primeval World diorama and the motorized tires embedded in the track which propelled and regulated the speed of ride vehicles inspired Disneyland s PeopleMover  and later the Tomorrowland Transit Authority of Walt Disney World Resort s Magic Kingdom  and Great Moments with Mr  Lincoln was expanded into The Hall of Presidents  Meanwhile  Disneyland still hosts the original  it s a small world  and Great Moments with Mr  Lincoln transferred from New York  as well as the now unused track of the original Disneyland PeopleMover based on the Ford s Magic Skyway  The original Carousel of Progress was first moved to Disneyland in 1967 and then to its current home at the Magic Kingdom in 1973   edit  Failure of amusements One of the fair s major shortcomings was the absence of a midway  The fair s organizers were opposed  on principle  to the honky tonk atmosphere engendered by midways  and this was another thing that irked the BIE  which insisted that all officially sanctioned fairs have a midway  What amusements the fair actually had ended up being largely dull  The Meadow Lake Amusement Area wasn t easily accessible  and officials objected to shows being advertised  Furthermore  although the Amusement Area was supposed to remain open for four hours after the exhibits closed at 10 p m   the fair presented a fountain and fireworks show every night at 9 p m  at the Pool of Industry  Fairgoers would see this show and then leave the fair rather than head to the Amusement Area  one was hard pressed to see anyone on the fairgrounds by midnight  The fair s big entertainment spectacles  including the  Wonder World  at the Meadow Lake Amphitheater   To Broadway with Love  in the Texas Pavilion  and Dick Button s  Ice travaganza  in the New York City Pavilion  all closed early  with heavy losses  It was apparent fairgoers did not go to the fair for its entertainment value  especially as there was plenty of entertainment in Manhattan  34   edit  Controversial ending The fair ended in controversy over allegations of financial mismanagement  Controversy had plagued it during much of its two year run  The Fair Corporation had taken in millions of dollars in advance ticket sales for both the 1964 and 1965 seasons  However  the receipts of these sales were booked entirely against the first season of the fair  5  This made it appear that the fair had plenty of operating cash when  in fact  it was borrowing from the second season s gate to pay the bills  Before and during the 1964 season  the fair spent much money despite attendance that was below expectations  By the end of the 1964 season  Moses and the press began to realize that there would not be enough money to pay the bills and the fair teetered on bankruptcy  5  While the 1939 1940 New York World s Fair returned 40 cents on the dollar to bond investors  the 1964 1965 fair returned only 19 2 cents on the dollar  5   edit  Reuse of pavilions Aerial view of the remaining structures in Flushing Meadows in 2004 Like its predecessor  the 1964 1965 New York World s Fair lost money  It was unable to repay its financial backers their investment  and it became embroiled in legal disputes with its creditors until 1970  when the books were finally closed and the New York World s Fair 1964 1965 Corporation was dissolved  Most of the pavilions constructed for the fair were demolished within six months following the fair s close  While only a handful of pavilions survived  some of them traveled great distances and found reuse following the fair  The Austria pavilion became a ski lodge at Cockaigne Ski Resort in western New York  On January 25  2011 the building was destroyed by fire  35  The Wisconsin pavilion s front tee pee like portion became a radio station in Neillsville  Wisconsin  The pavilion s large rear structure that formed a squat looking  H   if seen from above  is the combined kitchen  dining hall  and recreation hall of Camp Ramah in upstate Lakewood  Pennsylvania  The US Royal tire shaped Ferris wheel was relocated to become a landmark along Interstate 94 in the Metro Detroit Downriver community of Allen Park  Michigan  The Pavilion of Spain relocated to St  Louis  Missouri and is now a part of a Hilton Hotel  The Parker Pen pavilion became offices for the Lodge of Four Seasons in Lake of the Ozarks  Missouri  The Johnson Wax disc shaped theater was reworked and became part of the S C  Johnson Wax complex in Racine  Wisconsin designed by Frank Lloyd Wright  The stained glass windows from the Vatican pavilion were built into Saint Mary s Church in Groton  Connecticut  The Christian Science pavilion became a church in Poway  California  The structure was demolished in 2006  The Mormon pavilion became a church in Plainview  New York  dedicated December 2  1967 and still in use  A large oil painting of a woman  painted in 1964 by Roy Lichtenstein and titled  New York World s Fair   is in the Weisman Art Museum in Minneapolis  Minnesota  The carillon from the Coca Cola Pavilion was moved to Stone Mountain Park  near Atlanta  Georgia  The Probability Machine in the IBM pavilion was relocated to the Pacific Science Center in Seattle to become part of a mathematics exhibit sponsored by IBM which ran for many years  The illuminated  G  from the large fiberglass square and compasses that stood in front of the Masonic Brotherhood Center was moved to the New York Masonic Home campus in Utica  New York and installed into a smaller sculpture  The Grand Lodge of New York installed a bronze sculpture by artist Donald De Lue of George Washington in Masonic regalia at the fairgrounds after it closed  It still stands near the soccer fields   De Lue also sculpted the Fair s iconic  Rocket Thrower  sculpture   As noted  the Disney created attraction  it s a small world  was transferred to Disneyland  along with the  Carousel of Progress  and the first Abraham Lincoln audio animatronics figure for the original  Great Moments With Mr  Lincoln  show  Scenery and the audio animatronics dinosaurs from the Ford Magic Skyway show were installed in the Disneyland Railroad s Primeval World Diorama  and the attraction s actual WEDway ride system was improved upon and used for Tomorrowland s PeopleMover  Some of the light fixtures that lined the walkways can be found still functioning at Penn Hills Resort in the Poconos  Analomink  Pennsylvania  the Orange County Fairgrounds in Middletown  New York  and Canobie Lake Park in Salem  New Hampshire  36  The Skyway tower structures and gondolas were moved to Six Flags Great Adventure  at that time called Great Adventure  in New Jersey for use from 1974 to the present  37  The New England Pavilion was disassembled and moved to South Portland  Maine where most of it was reassembled and still in use today as a small shopping mall at 50 Maine Mall Road  The Travelors Exhibit is on display in a museum in Cincinnati  Ohio  reference AAA Travel Guide   edit  Legacy The Unisphere on July 31  2010  New York City was left with a much improved Flushing Meadows Park following the fair  taking possession of the park from the Fair Corporation in June 1967  It is heavily used for both walking and recreation  The paths and their names remain almost unchanged from the days of the fair  At the center of the park stands the symbol of  Man s Achievements on a Shrinking Globe in an Expanding Universe    the fair s Unisphere symbol  depicting our earth of  The Space Age   The Unisphere was made famous again in 1997 when it was featured in the film Men in Black  The Unisphere has become a symbol of Queens  and has appeared on the cover of the borough s phone books  The city also received a multi million dollar Science Museum and Space Park exhibiting the rockets and vehicles used in America s early space exploration projects  The observatory towers in 2006 Both the New York State pavilion and the US Pavilion were retained for future use  No reuse was ever found for the US Pavilion  and it became severely deteriorated and vandalized before being demolished in 1977  The New York State pavilion also found no residual use other than as TV and movie sets  such as an episode of McCloud  for The Wiz  and part of the setting  and the plot  for Men in Black  In the decades after the fair closed  it remains an abandoned and badly neglected relic  with its roof gone and the once bright floors and walls almost faded away  In 1994  the Queens Theatre took over the Circarama adjacent to the towers and continues to operate there  using the ruined state pavilion as a storage depot  The Space Park deteriorated due to neglect  but the surviving rockets were restored and placed back on display in 2004  It is presently open again as part of the New York Hall of Science  a portion of which is a remnant of the fair  The fair s Heliport has found reuse as a banquet catering facility called  Terrace on the Park   In 1978  Flushing Meadows Corona Park  as it is now called  became the home of the United States Tennis Association  and the US Open tennis tournament is played there annually  The former Singer Bowl  later renamed Louis Armstrong Stadium  was the tournament s primary venue until the larger Arthur Ashe Stadium was built on the site of the former Federal Pavilion and opened in August 1997  Collectively  the complex is called the USTA National Tennis Center  The R36 cars built for the IRT 7 subway route that served the 1964 fair ran the route for over 39 years afterwards  with some cars lasting into 2003  Some of them still survive today in work use or storage  The former New York City building is home to the Queens Museum of Art and continues to display the multi million dollar model of the city of New York  This historic structure also  as of 2012  has an excellent display of memorabilia from the two fairs  For many years  the section where the early United Nations General Assembly met had reverted back to its historic role as an ice skating rink  but in 2009 the skating rink moved to a new recreation center across the park  In April 2011 the museum broke ground on an ambitious expansion project in the old skating rink that will about double the museum s floor space  bringing the total to about 100 000 square feet  38  Shea Stadium  while not part of the fairgrounds proper  was opened at the same time as the fair and was listed in the fair s maps  It was the home of the New York Mets baseball team until 2008  It was demolished and the space used for parking for the adjacent new stadium  Citi Field  in 2009  During the 1964 and 1965 Seasons  the team added a World s Fair commemorative patch to the left sleeve of their home jersey and the right sleeve of their road jersey  39  Commemorative postage stamps were produced for the fair  souvenir medals were issued  and a lot of memorabilia remains in private hands  There is significant interest in collecting these pieces  Items of all types  many quite inexpensive  frequently appear in sales  For many years the fair s amateur radio station console was used by the American Radio Relay League  Later sold  in 2006 it was purchased by a Collins Radio collector in Texas  40  Also  parts of Universal Studios Florida in Orlando  Florida may have been inspired by the 1964 New York World s Fair  citation needed  The entrance to the park has a globe that resembles the Unisphere with  Universal Studios  on it  although Universal Studios began using the globe as its logo decades earlier   and an area of the park called  World Expo  that features worldly music and flags of many nations  In 1999  the World Expo area expanded and opened the Men In Black  Alien Attack attraction with recreations of New York observatory towers in front of the building  The attraction itself is based on a fictional World s Fair pavilion  Visitors enter as tourists but soon ride an elevator to the facility and learn that they are trying out to be a part of the Men in Black  Walt Disney moved most of his attractions from the fair to Disneyland  Today   it s a small world  is still active  Mr  Lincoln returned in late 2009 after a four year hiatus  Parts of Ford s Magic Skyway are installed along the Disneyland Railroad  while the Carousel of Progress still spins at Walt Disney World s Magic Kingdom   it s a small world  is an attraction at all five Disney Magic Kingdom style parks  and its theme song is among the most popular on the planet  Disney used the technologies from the fair to create the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction  and Epcot Center s original attractions borrowed heavily from the audio animatronic advances of the fair and its general ideals  citation needed  In 1995  PBS produced The 1964 World s Fair  a 52 minute documentary about the fair  narrated by Judd Hirsch  41  In the 2010 movie Iron Man 2  Flushing Meadow Park is where the fictional Stark Expo 2010 and Stark Expo 74 take place   edit  Use in sports Many of the funds from the fair went into the building of Shea Stadium  This building served as home for the New York Mets baseball team from 1964 to 2008  when it was demolished  The stadium played host to the World Series four times  in 1969  1973  1986  and 2000  The Mets moved to the stadium from the aging Polo Grounds in Manhattan  Shea Stadium also served as the home of the New York Jets from 1964 to 1983  the New York Yankees in 1974 and 1975 while Yankee Stadium was being renovated  and the New York Giants in 1975  In the Mets  new ballpark  Citi Field  there is a food court called the World s Fare Market which pays homage to the team s connection to
