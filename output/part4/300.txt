best known for his work in the science fiction genre  He was also a prolific writer in many other genres  including contemporary novels  history  politics and social commentary  even writing text books and rules for war games  Together with Jules Verne and Hugo Gernsback  Wells has been referred to as  The Father of Science Fiction   2  Wells s earliest specialized training was in biology  and his thinking on ethical matters took place in a specifically and fundamentally Darwinian context  3  He was also from an early date an outspoken socialist  often  but not always  as the beginning of the First World War  sympathizing with pacifist views  His later works became increasingly political and didactic  and he sometimes indicated on official documents that his profession was that of  Journalist   4  Many of his novels  particularly those of his middle period  1900 1920   had nothing to do with science fiction  They described lower middle class life  Kipps  The History of Mr Polly   and this work sometimes led Wells to be touted as a worthy successor to Charles Dickens  5  Wells also wrote abundantly about the  New Woman  and the Suffragettes  Ann Veronica   Contents 1 Early

in the county of Kent  a small market town  6  on 21 September 1866  1  Called  Bertie  in the family  he was the fourth and last child of Joseph Wells  a former domestic gardener  and at the time a shopkeeper and professional cricketer  and his wife Sarah Neal  a former domestic servant   The family was of the impoverished lower middle class  An inheritance had allowed the family to acquire a shop in which they sold china and sporting goods  although it failed to prosper  the stock was old and worn out  and the location was poor  Joseph Wells managed to earn a meagre income  but little of it came from the shop  Joseph received an unsteady amount of money from playing professional cricket for the Kent county team  7  Payment for skilled bowlers and batsmen came from voluntary donations afterwards  or from small payments from the clubs where matches were played  A defining incident of young Wells s life was an accident he had in 1874  which left him bedridden with a broken leg  1  To pass the time he started reading books from the local library  brought to him by his father  He soon became devoted to the other worlds and lives to which books gave him access  they also stimulated his desire to write  Later that year he entered Thomas Morley s Commercial Academy  a private school founded in 1849 following the bankruptcy of Morley s earlier school  The teaching was erratic  the curriculum mostly focused  Wells later said  on producing copperplate handwriting and doing the sort of sums useful to tradesmen  Wells continued at Morley s Academy until 1880  In 1877  his father  Joseph Wells  fractured his thigh  The accident effectively put an end to Joseph s career as a cricketer  and his subsequent earnings as a shopkeeper were not enough to compensate for the loss of the primary source of family income  No longer able to support themselves financially  the family instead sought to place their sons as apprentices in various occupations  From 1880 to 1883  Wells had an unhappy apprenticeship as a draper at the Southsea Drapery Emporium  Hyde s  8  His experiences at Hyde s  where he worked a thirteen hour day and slept in a dormitory with other apprentices  6  were later used as inspiration for some of his novel material The Wheels of Chance and Kipps  9  which delve into the life of a draper s apprentice as well as providing a critique of the world s distribution of wealth  Herbert s parents  marriage was a turbulent relationship  due primarily to his mother being a Protestant and his father a self confessed freethinker  When his mother returned to work as a lady s maid  at Uppark  a country house in Sussex   one of the conditions of work was that she would not be permitted to have living space for her husband and children  Thereafter  she and Joseph lived separate lives  though they never divorced and neither ever developed extramarital liaisons  As a consequence  Herbert s personal troubles increased as he subsequently failed as a draper and also  later  as a chemist s assistant  After each failure  he would arrive at Uppark    the bad shilling back again   as he said   and stay there until a fresh start could be arranged for him  Fortunately for Herbert  Uppark had a magnificent library in which he immersed himself  reading many classic works  including Plato s Republic  and More s Utopia  This would be the beginning of Herbert George Wells s venture into literature   edit  Teacher H  G  Wells studying in London  taken circa 1890 H  G  Wells in 1907 at the door of his house at Sandgate In October 1879 Wells s mother arranged through a distant relative  Arthur Williams  for him to join the National School at Wookey in Somerset as a pupil teacher  a senior pupil who acted as a teacher of younger children  8  In December that year  however  Williams was dismissed for irregularities in his qualifications and Wells was returned to Uppark  After a short apprenticeship at a chemist in nearby Midhurst  and an even shorter stay as a boarder at Midhurst Grammar School  he signed his apprenticeship papers at Hyde s  In 1883 Wells persuaded his parents to release him from the apprenticeship  taking an opportunity offered by Midhurst Grammar School again to become a pupil teacher  his proficiency in Latin and science during his previous  short stay had been remembered  7  8  The years he spent in Southsea had been the most miserable of his life to that point  but his good fortune at securing a position at Midhurst Grammar School meant that Wells could continue his self education in earnest  7  The following year  Wells won a scholarship to the Normal School of Science  later the Royal College of Science in South Kensington  now part of Imperial College London  in London  studying biology under Thomas Henry Huxley  As an alumnus  he later helped to set up the Royal College of Science Association  of which he became the first president in 1909  Wells studied in his new school until 1887 with a weekly allowance of twenty one shillings  a guinea  thanks to his scholarship  This ought to have been a comfortable sum of money  at the time many working class families had  round about a pound a week  as their entire household income  10  yet in his Experiment in Autobiography  Wells speaks of constantly being hungry  and indeed  photographs of him at the time show a youth very thin and malnourished  He soon entered the Debating Society of the school  These years mark the beginning of his interest in a possible reformation of society  At first approaching the subject through The Republic by Plato  he soon turned to contemporary ideas of socialism as expressed by the recently formed Fabian Society and free lectures delivered at Kelmscott House  the home of William Morris  He was also among the founders of The Science School Journal  a school magazine which allowed him to express his views on literature and society  as well as trying his hand at fiction  the first version of his novel The Time Machine was published in the journal under the title  The Chronic Argonauts  The school year 1886 1887 was the last year of his studies  In spite of having previously successfully passed his exams in both biology and physics  his lack of interest in geology resulted in his failure to pass and the subsequent loss of his scholarship  It was not until 1890 that Wells earned a Bachelor of Science degree in zoology from the University of London External Programme  In 1889 90 he managed to find a post as a teacher at Henley House School where he taught A  A  Milne  11  12  Upon leaving the Normal School of Science  Wells was left without a source of income  His aunt Mary his father s sister in law invited him to stay with her for a while  which solved his immediate problem of accommodation  During his stay at his aunt s residence  he grew increasingly interested in her daughter  Isabel  He would later go on to court her   edit  Personal life In the mid 1890s Wells s lived at 143 Maybury Road  Woking 13  In 1891 Wells  married his cousin Isabel Mary Wells  but the couple agreed to separate in 1894 when he fell in love with one of his students  Amy Catherine Robbins  known as Jane   whom he married in 1895  14  Poor health took him to Sandgate  near Folkestone  where in 1901 he constructed a large family home  Spade House  He had two sons with Jane  George Philip  known as  Gip   in 1901  d 1985  and Frank Richard in 1903  The marriage lasted until her death in 1927  citation needed  With his wife s agreement  Wells had affairs with a number of women  including the American birth control activist Margaret Sanger 15  not in citation given  and novelist Elizabeth von Arnim  In 1909 he had a daughter  Anna Jane  with the writer Amber Reeves  citation needed  whose parents  William and Maud Pember Reeves  he had met through the Fabian Society  and in 1914  a son  Anthony West  1914 1987   by the novelist and feminist Rebecca West  twenty six years his junior  16   I was never a great amorist   Wells wrote in Experiment in Autobiography  1934    though I have loved several people very deeply    edit  Artist One of the most interesting ways that Wells expressed himself was through his drawings and sketches  One common location for these was the endpapers and title pages of his own diaries  and they covered a wide variety of topics  from political commentary to his feelings toward his literary contemporaries and his current romantic interests  During his marriage to Amy Catherine  whom he nicknamed Jane  he penned a considerable number of pictures  many of them being overt comments on their marriage  It was during this period  and this period only  that he called these pictures  picshuas   17  These picshuas have been the topic of study by Wells scholars for many years  and recently a book was published on the subject  18   edit  Writer Wells s first non fiction bestseller was Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress Upon Human Life and Thought  1901   19  When originally serialised in a magazine it was subtitled   An Experiment in Prophecy   and is considered his most explicitly futuristic work  Anticipating what the world would be like in the year 2000  the book is interesting both for its hits  trains and cars resulting in the dispersion of population from cities to suburbs  moral restrictions declining as men and women seek greater sexual freedom  the defeat of German militarism  and the existence of a European Union  and its misses  he did not expect successful aircraft before 1950  and averred that  my imagination refuses to see any sort of submarine doing anything but suffocate its crew and founder at sea    Statue of a The War of the Worlds tripod  erected as a tribute to H  G  Wells in the centre of the town of Woking  England Some of his early novels  called  scientific romances   invented a number of themes now classic in science fiction in such works as The Time Machine  The Island of Doctor Moreau  The Invisible Man  The War of the Worlds  When the Sleeper Wakes  and The First Men in the Moon  He also wrote other  non fantastic novels that have received critical acclaim including Kipps and the satire on Edwardian advertising  Tono Bungay  Wells also wrote dozens of short stories and novellas  the best known of which is  The Country of the Blind   1904   His short story  The New Accelerator  was the inspiration for the Star Trek episode Wink of an Eye  20  Though Tono Bungay was not a science fiction novel  radioactive decay plays a small but consequential role in it  Radioactive decay plays a much larger role in The World Set Free  1914   This book contains what is surely his biggest prophetic  hit   Scientists of the day were well aware that the natural decay of radium releases energy at a slow rate over thousands of years  The rate of release is too slow to have practical utility  but the total amount released is huge  Wells s novel revolves around an  unspecified  invention that accelerates the process of radioactive decay  producing bombs that explode with no more than the force of ordinary high explosive but which  continue to explode  for days on end   Nothing could have been more obvious to the people of the earlier twentieth century   he wrote   than the rapidity with which war was becoming impossible     but  they did not see it until the atomic bombs burst in their fumbling hands   In 1932  the physicist and conceiver of nuclear chain reaction Le  Szil rd read The World Set Free  a book which he said made a great impression on him  21  Wells also wrote nonfiction  His bestselling three volume work  The Outline of History  1920   began a new era of popularised world history  It received a mixed critical response from professional historians  22  Many other authors followed with  Outlines  of their own in other subjects  Wells reprised his Outline in 1922 with a much shorter popular work  A Short History of the World  23  and two long efforts  The Science of Life  1930  and The Work  Wealth and Happiness of Mankind  1931   The  Outlines  became sufficiently common for James Thurber to parody the trend in his humorous essay   An Outline of Scientists  indeed  Wells s Outline of History remains in print with a new 2005 edition  while A Short History of the World has been recently reedited  2006   From quite early in his career  he sought a better way to organise society  and wrote a number of Utopian novels  The first of these was A Modern Utopia  1905   which shows a worldwide utopia with  no imports but meteorites  and no exports at all   24  two travellers from our world fall into its alternate history  The others usually begin with the world rushing to catastrophe  until people realise a better way of living  whether by mysterious gases from a comet causing people to behave rationally and abandoning a European war  In the Days of the Comet  1906    or a world council of scientists taking over  as in The Shape of Things to Come  1933  which he later adapted for the 1936 Alexander Korda film  Things to Come   This depicted  all too accurately  the impending World War  with cities being destroyed by aerial bombs  He also portrayed the rise of fascist dictators in The Autocracy of Mr Parham  1930  and The Holy Terror  1939   Men Like Gods  1923  is also a utopian novel  H  G  Wells in 1943 Wells contemplates the ideas of nature versus nurture and questions humanity in books such as The Island of Doctor Moreau  Not all his scientific romances ended in a happy Utopia  and in fact  Wells also wrote the first dystopia novel  When the Sleeper Wakes  1899  rewritten as The Sleeper Awakes  1910   which pictures a future society where the classes have become more and more separated  leading to a revolt of the masses against the rulers  The Island of Doctor Moreau is even darker  The narrator  having been trapped on an island of animals vivisected  unsuccessfully  into human beings  eventually returns to England  like Gulliver on his return from the Houyhnhnms  he finds himself unable to shake off the perceptions of his fellow humans as barely civilised beasts  slowly reverting to their animal natures  Wells also wrote the preface for the first edition of W  N  P  Barbellion s diaries  The Journal of a Disappointed Man  published in 1919  Since  Barbellion  was the real author s pen name  many reviewers believed Wells to have been the true author of the Journal  Wells always denied this  despite being full of praise for the diaries  but the rumours persisted until Barbellion s death later that year  In 1927  Florence Deeks sued Wells for plagiarism  claiming that he had stolen much of the content of The Outline of History from a work  The Web  she had submitted to the Canadian Macmillan Company  but who held onto the manuscript for eight months before rejecting it  Despite numerous similarities in phrasing and factual errors  the court found the evidence inadequate and dismissed the case  A Privy Council report added that  as Deek s work had not been printed  there were no legal grounds at all for the action  25  In 1933 Wells predicted in The Shape of Things to Come that the world war he feared would begin January 1940  26  a prediction which ultimately came true just four months early  when the Second World War broke out in September 1939  27  In 1936  before the Royal Institution  Wells called for the compilation of a constantly growing and changing World Encyclopedia  to be reviewed by outstanding authorities and made accessible to every human being  In 1938  he published a collection of essays on the future organisation of knowledge and education  World Brain  including the essay   The Idea of a Permanent World Encyclopaedia   Near the end of the Second World War  Allied forces discovered that the SS had compiled lists of people slated for immediate arrest during the invasion of Britain in the abandoned Operation Sea Lion  and Wells was included in the alphabetical list on the same page of  The Black Book  as Rebecca West  28  Wells  as president of the International PEN  Poets  Essayists  Novelists   had already angered the Nazis by overseeing the expulsion of the German PEN club from the international body in 1934 following the German PEN s refusal to admit non Aryan writers to its membership  Seeking a more structured way to play war games  Wells also wrote Floor Games  1911  followed by Little Wars  1913   Little Wars is recognised today as the first recreational wargame and Wells is regarded by gamers and hobbyists as  the Father of Miniature War Gaming   29   edit  Politics  edit  The Fabian Society Wells called his political views socialist  He was for a time a member of the socialist Fabian Society  but broke with them as his creative political imagination  matching the originality shown in his fiction  outran theirs  30  He later grew staunchly critical of them as having a poor understanding of economics and educational reform  He ran as a Labour Party candidate for London University in the 1922 and 1923 general elections after the death of his friend W  H  R  Rivers  but at that point his faith in the party was weak or uncertain   edit  Class Social class was a theme in Wells s The Time Machine in which the Time Traveller speaks of the future world  with its two races  as having evolved from the gradual widening of the present  19th century  merely temporary and social difference between the Capitalist and the Labourer     Even now  does not an East end worker live in such artificial conditions as practically to be cut off from the natural surface of the earth  Again  the exclusive tendency of richer people     is already leading to the closing  in their interest  of considerable portions of the surface of the land  About London  for instance  perhaps half the prettier country is shut in against intrusion  31  Nevertheless  Wells has this very same Time Traveller speak in terms unusual for socialist thought  referring as  perfect  and with no social problem unsolved  to an imagined world of stark class division between the rich assured of their wealth and comfort  and the rest of humanity assigned to lifelong toil  Once  life and property must have reached almost absolute safety  The rich had been assured of his wealth and comfort  the toiler assured of his life and work  No doubt in that perfect world there had been no unemployed problem  no social question left unsolved  31   edit  World Government His most consistent political ideal was the World State  He stated in his autobiography that from 1900 onward he considered a World State inevitable  He envisioned the state to be a planned society that would advance science  end nationalism  and allow people to progress by merit rather than birth   edit  World War I He supported Britain in the First World War  despite his many criticisms of British policy  and opposed  in 1916  moves for an early peace  32  In an essay published that year he acknowledged that he could not understand those British pacifists who were reconciled to  handing over great blocks of the black and coloured races to the  German Empire  to exploit and experiment upon  and that the extent of his own pacifism depended in the first instance upon an armed peace  with  England keep ing  to England and Germany to Germany   State boundaries would be established according to natural ethnic affinities  rather than by planners in distant imperial capitals  and overseen by his envisaged world alliance of states  33  In his book In the Fourth Year published in 1918 he suggested how each nation of the world would elect   upon democratic lines  by proportional representation  an electoral college in the manner of the United States of America  in turn to select its delegate to the proposed League of Nations  34  This international body he contrasted with imperialism  not only the imperialism of Germany  against which the war was being fought  but also the imperialism  which he considered more benign  of Britain and France  35  His values and political thinking came under increasing criticism from the 1920s and afterwards  36   edit  The Soviet Union The leadership of Joseph Stalin led to a change in his view of the Soviet Union even though his initial impression of Stalin himself was mixed  He disliked what he saw as a narrow orthodoxy and obdurance to the facts in Stalin  However  he did give him some praise saying in an article in the left leaning New Statesman magazine   I have never met a man more fair  candid  and honest  and making it clear that he felt the  sinister  image of Stalin was unfair or simply false  Nevertheless he judged Stalin s rule to be far too rigid  restrictive of independent thought  and blinkered to lead toward the Cosmopolis he hoped for  37  In the course of his visit to the Soviet Union in 1934  he debated the merits of reformist socialism over Marxism Leninism with Stalin  38   edit  Eugenics Wells believed in the theory of eugenics  In 1904 he discussed a survey paper by Francis Galton  co founder of eugenics  saying  I believe     It is in the sterilisation of failure  and not in the selection of successes for breeding  that the possibility of an improvement of the human stock lies   Some contemporary supporters even suggested connections between the  degenerate  man creatures portrayed in The Time Machine and Wells s eugenic beliefs  For example  the economist Irving Fisher said in a 1912 address to the Eugenics Research Association   The Nordic race will     vanish or lose its dominance if  in fact  the whole human race does not sink so low as to become the prey  as H  G  Wells images  of some less degenerate animal   39   edit  Zionism Wells had given some moderate  unenthusiastic support for Territorialism before the First World War  but later became a bitter opponent of the Zionist movement in general  He saw Zionism as an exclusive and separatist movement which challenged the collective solidarity he advocated in his vision of a world state  No supporter of Jewish identity in general  Wells had in his utopian writings predicted the ultimate assimilation of the Jewish people  In his biographical novel  A Man of Parts   pp 521 2  David Lodge attributes regret to Wells over his attitudes to the Jews as he became more aware of the extent of the Nazi atrocities  This included a letter of apology written to Chaim Weizmann for earlier statements he had made  40  41  42   edit  Other endeavours Wells brought his interest in Art  amp  Design and politics together when he and other notables signed a memorandum to the Permanent Secretaries of the Board of Trade  among others  The November 1914 memorandum expressed the signatories concerns about British industrial design in the face of foreign competition  The suggestions were accepted  leading to the foundation of the Design and Industries Association  43  In the end his contemporary political impact was limited  His efforts regarding the League of Nations became a disappointment as the organisation turned out to be a weak one unable to prevent World War II  The war itself increased the pessimistic side of his nature  In his last book Mind at the End of its Tether  1945  he considered the idea that humanity being replaced by another species might not be a bad idea  He also came to call the era  The Age of Frustration    edit  Religion Wells wrote in his book God the Invisible King that his idea of God did not draw upon the traditional religions of the world   This book sets out as forcibly and exactly as possible the religious belief of the writer   Which  is a profound belief in a personal and intimate God   44  Later in the work he aligns himself with a  renascent or modern religion     neither atheist nor Buddhist nor Mohammedan nor Christian      that  he has found growing up in himself   45  Of Christianity he has this to say       it is not now true for me     Every believing Christian is  I am sure  my spiritual brother     but if systemically I called myself a Christian I feel that to most men I should imply too much and so tell a lie   Of other world religions he writes   All these religions are true for me as Canterbury Cathedral is a true thing and as a Swiss chalet is a true thing  There they are  and they have served a purpose  they have worked  Only they are not true for me to live in them     They do not work for me   46   edit  Final years A mural devoted to Wells in his home town of Bromley  Painted in 1986  it was removed in the early 21st century  He spent his final years venting his frustration citation needed  at various targets which included a neighbour who erected a large sign to a servicemen s club  citation needed  It was also at that time that he began to be particularly outspoken in his criticism of the Catholic Church  47  Wells s literary reputation declined as he spent his later years promoting causes that were rejected by most of his contemporaries  G  K  Chesterton quipped   Mr  Wells is a born storyteller who has sold his birthright for a pot of message   48  Wells was a diabetic  49  and a co founder in 1934 of what is now Diabetes UK  the leading charity for people living with diabetes in the UK  On 28 October 1940 Wells was interviewed by Orson Welles  who two years previous had performed an infamous radio adaptation of The War of the Worlds  on KTSA radio in San Antonio  Texas  In the interview  Wells admitted his surprise at the widespread panic that resulted from the broadcast  but acknowledged his debt to Welles for increasing sales of one of his  more obscure  titles  50  He died of unspecified causes on 13 August 1946 at his home at 13 Hanover Terrace  Regent s Park  London  aged 79  51  Some reports indicate the cause of death was diabetes or liver cancer  52  In his preface to the 1941 edition of The War in the Air  Wells had stated that his epitaph should be   I told you so  You damned fools   53  He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 16 August 1946 and his ashes were scattered at sea  54  A commemorative blue plaque in his honour was installed at his home in Regent s Park   edit  In popular fiction This section
