from different viewpoints Holography  from the Greek      h los   whole          graf    writing  drawing   is a technique that allows the light scattered from an object to be recorded and later reconstructed so that when an imaging system  a camera or an eye  is placed in the reconstructed beam  an image of the object will be seen even when the object is no longer present  The image changes as the position and orientation of the viewing system changes in exactly the same way as if the object were still present  thus making the image appear three dimensional  The holographic recording itself is not a plain image   it consists of an apparently random structure of either varying intensity  density or profile  Contents 1 Overview and history 2 How holography works 2 1 Laser 2 2

British physicist Dennis Gabor  Hungarian name  G bor D nes   1  2  was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1971 for  for his invention and development of the holographic method   3  His work  done in the late 1940s  built on pioneering work in the field of X ray microscopy by other scientists including Mieczys aw Wolfke in 1920 and WL Bragg in 1939  4  The discovery was an unexpected result of research into improving electron microscopes at the British Thomson Houston Company in Rugby  England  and the company filed a patent in December 1947  patent GB685286   The technique as originally invented is still used in electron microscopy  where it is known as electron holography  but optical holography did not really advance until the development of the laser in 1960  The development of the laser enabled the first practical optical holograms that recorded 3D objects to be made in 1962 by Yuri Denisyuk in the Soviet Union 5  and by Emmett Leith and Juris Upatnieks at University of Michigan  USA  6  Early holograms used silver halide photographic emulsions as the recording medium  They were not very efficient as the grating produced absorbed much of the incident light  Various methods of converting the variation in transmission to a variation in refractive index  known as  bleaching   were developed which enabled much more efficient holograms to be produced  7  8  9  Several types of holograms can be made  Transmission holograms  such as those produced by Leith and Upatnieks  are viewed by shining laser light through them and looking at the reconstructed image from the side of the hologram opposite the source  10  A later refinement  the  rainbow transmission  hologram  allows more convenient illumination by white light rather than by lasers  11  Rainbow holograms are commonly seen today on credit cards as a security feature and on product packaging  Another kind of common hologram  the reflection or Denisyuk hologram  can also be viewed using a white light illumination source on the same side of the hologram as the viewer and is the type of hologram normally seen in holographic displays  They are also capable of multicolour image reproduction  12  Specular holography is a related technique for making three dimensional images by controlling the motion of specularities on a two dimensional surface  13  It works by reflectively or refractively manipulating bundles of light rays  whereas Gabor style holography works by diffractively reconstructing wavefronts  Most holograms produced are of static objects but systems for displaying changing scenes on a holographic volumetric display are now being developed  14  15  16  Holograms can also be used to store  retrieve  and process information optically  17  In its early days  holography required high power expensive lasers  but nowadays  mass produced low cost semi conductor or LED lasers  such as those found in millions of DVD recorders and used in other common applications  can be used to make holograms and have made holography much more accessible to low budget researchers  artists and dedicated hobbyists  It was thought that it would be possible to use X rays to make holograms of molecules and view them using visible light  However  X ray holograms have not been created to date  18   edit  How holography works Recording a hologram Reconstructing a hologram Close up photograph of a hologram s surface  The object in the hologram is a toy van  It is no more possible to discern the subject of a hologram from this pattern than it is to identify what music has been recorded by looking at a CD surface  Note that the hologram is described by the speckle pattern  rather than the  wavy  line pattern  Holography is a technique that enables a light field  which is generally the product of a light source scattered off of objects  to be recorded and later reconstructed when the original light field is no longer present  due to the absence of the original objects  19  Holography can be thought of as somewhat similar to sound recording  whereby a sound field created by vibrating matter like musical instruments or vocal cords  is encoded in such a way that it can be reproduced later  without the presence of the original vibrating matter   edit  Laser Holograms are recorded using a flash of light that illuminates a scene and then imprints on a recording medium  much in the way a photograph is recorded  In addition  however  part of the light beam must be shone directly onto the recording medium   this second light beam is known as the reference beam  A hologram requires a laser as the sole light source  Lasers can be precisely controlled and have a fixed wavelength  unlike sunlight or light from conventional sources  which contain many different wavelengths  To prevent external light from interfering  holograms are usually taken in darkness  or in low level light of a different colour from the laser light used in making the hologram  Holography requires a specific exposure time  just like photography   which can be controlled using a shutter  or by electronically timing the laser   edit  Apparatus A hologram can be made by shining part of the light beam directly onto the recording medium  and the other part onto the object in such a way that some of the scattered light falls onto the recording medium  A more flexible arrangement for recording a hologram requires the laser beam to be aimed through a series of elements that change it in different ways  The first element is a beam splitter that divides the beam into two identical beams  each aimed in different directions  One beam  known as the illumination or object beam  is spread using lenses and directed onto the scene using mirrors  Some of the light scattered  reflected  from the scene then falls onto the recording medium  The second beam  known as the reference beam  is also spread through the use of lenses  but is directed so that it doesn t come in contact with the scene  and instead travels directly onto the recording medium  Several different materials can be used as the recording medium  One of the most common is a film very similar to photographic film  silver halide photographic emulsion   but with a much higher concentration of light reactive grains  making it capable of the much higher resolution that holograms require  A layer of this recording medium  film  etc   is attached to a transparent substrate  which is commonly glass  but may also be plastic   edit  Process When the two laser beams reach the recording medium  their light waves intersect and interfere with each other  It is this interference pattern that is imprinted on the recording medium  The pattern itself is seemingly random  as it represents the way in which the scene s light interfered with the original light source   but not the original light source itself  The interference pattern can be said to be an encoded version of the scene  requiring a particular key   that is  the original light source   in order to view its contents  This missing key is provided later by shining a laser  identical to the one used to record the hologram  onto the developed film  When this beam illuminates the hologram  it is diffracted by the hologram s surface pattern  This produces a light field that is identical to the one originally produced by the scene and scattered onto the hologram  The image this effect produces in a person s retina is known as a virtual image   edit  Holography vs  photography Holography may be better understood via an examination of its differences from ordinary photography  A hologram represents a recording of information regarding the light that came from the original scene as scattered in a range of directions rather than from only one direction  as in a photograph  This allows the scene to be viewed from a range of different angles  as if it were still present  A lens is required in photography to record the image  whereas in holography  the light from the object is scattered directly onto the recording medium  A holographic recording requires a second light beam  the reference beam  to be directed onto the recording medium  When a photograph is cut in half  each piece shows half of the scene  When a hologram is cut in half  the whole scene can still be seen in each piece  This is because  whereas each point in a photograph only represents light scattered from a single point in the scene  each point on a holographic recording includes information about light scattered from every point in the scene  Think of viewing a street outside your house through a 4 ft x 4 ft window  and then through a 2 ft x 2 ft window  You can see all of the same things through the smaller window  by moving your head to change your viewing angle   but you can see more at once through the 4 ft window  Whereas a photograph is a two dimensional representation that can only reproduce a rudimentary three dimensional effect  the reproduced viewing range of a hologram adds many more depth perception cues that were present in the original scene  These cues are recognized by the human brain and translated into the same perception of a three dimensional image as when the original scene might have been viewed  A photograph clearly maps out the light field of the original scene  The developed hologram s surface consists of a very fine  seemingly random pattern  which appears to bear no relationship to the scene it recorded  A photograph can be viewed in a wide range of lighting conditions  whereas holograms can only be viewed with very specific forms of illumination   edit  Physics of holography For a better understanding of the process  it is necessary to understand interference and diffraction  Interference occurs when one or more wavefronts are superimposed  Diffraction occurs whenever a wavefront encounters an object  The process of producing a holographic reconstruction is explained below purely in terms of interference and diffraction  It is somewhat simplified but is accurate enough to provide an understanding of how the holographic process works  For those unfamiliar with these concepts  it is worthwhile to read the respective articles before reading further in this article   edit  Plane wavefronts A diffraction grating is a structure with a repeating pattern  A simple example is a metal plate with slits cut at regular intervals  A light wave incident on a grating is split into several waves  the direction of these diffracted waves is determined by the grating spacing and the wavelength of the light  A simple hologram can be made by superimposing two plane waves from the same light source on a holographic recording medium  The two waves interfere giving a straight line fringe pattern whose intensity varies sinusoidally across the medium  The spacing of the fringe pattern is determined by the angle between the two waves  and on the wavelength of the light  The recorded light pattern is a diffraction grating  When it is illuminated by only one of the waves used to create it  it can be shown that one of the diffracted waves emerges at the same angle as that at which the second wave was originally incident so that the second wave has been  reconstructed   Thus  the recorded light pattern is a holographic recording as defined above   edit  Point sources Sinusoidal zone plate If the recording medium is illuminated with a point source and a normally incident plane wave  the resulting pattern is a sinusoidal zone plate which acts as a negative Fresnel lens whose focal length is equal to the separation of the point source and the recording plane  When a plane wavefront illuminates a negative lens  it is expanded into a wave which appears to diverge from the focal point of the lens  Thus  when the recorded pattern is illuminated with the original plane wave  some of the light is diffracted into a diverging beam equivalent to the original plane wave  a holographic recording of the point source has been created  When the plane wave is incident at a non normal angle  the pattern formed is more complex but still acts as a negative lens provided it is illuminated at the original angle   edit  Complex objects To record a hologram of a complex object  a laser beam is first split into two separate beams of light  One beam illuminates the object  which then scatters light onto the recording medium  According to diffraction theory  each point in the object acts as a point source of light so the recording medium can be considered to be illuminated by a set of point sources located at varying distances from the medium  The second  reference  beam illuminates the recording medium directly  Each point source wave interferes with the reference beam  giving rise to its own sinusoidal zone plate in the recording medium  The resulting pattern is the sum of all these  zone plates  which combine to produce a random  speckle  pattern as in the photograph above  When the hologram is illuminated by the original reference beam  each of the individual zone plates reconstructs the object wave which produced it  and these individual wavefronts add together to reconstruct the whole of the object beam  The viewer perceives a wavefront that is identical to the wavefront scattered from the object onto the recording medium  so that it appears to him or her that the object is still in place even if it has been removed  This image is known as a  virtual  image  as it is generated even though the object is no longer there   edit  Mathematical model A light wave can be modelled by a complex number U  which represents the electric or magnetic field of the light wave  The amplitude and phase of the light are represented by the absolute value and angle of the complex number  The object and reference waves at any point in the holographic system are given by UO and UR  The combined beam is given by UO   UR  The energy of the combined beams is proportional to the square of magnitude of the combined waves as  If a photographic plate is exposed to the two beams and then developed  its transmittance  T  is proportional to the light energy that was incident on the plate and is given by where k is a constant  When the developed plate is illuminated by the reference beam  the light transmitted through the plate  UH is equal to the transmittance T multiplied by the reference beam amplitude UR  giving It can be seen that UH has four terms  each representing a light beam emerging from the hologram  The first of these is proportional to UO  This is the reconstructed object beam which enables a viewer to  see  the original object even when it is no longer present in the field of view  The second and third beams are modified versions of the reference beam  The fourth term is known as the  conjugate object beam   It has the reverse curvature to the object beam itself and forms a real image of the object in the space beyond the holographic plate  When the reference and object beams are incident on the holographic recording medium at significantly different angles  the virtual  real and reference wavefronts all emerge at different angles  enabling the reconstructed object to be seen clearly   edit  Recording a hologram  edit  Items required An optical table being used to make a hologram To make a hologram  the following are required  a suitable object or set of objects a suitable laser beam part of the laser beam to be directed so that it illuminates the object  the object beam  and another part so that it illuminates the recording medium directly  the reference beam   enabling the reference beam and the light which is scattered from the object onto the recording medium to form an intereference pattern a recording medium which converts this interference pattern into an optical element which modifies either the amplitude or the phase of an incident light beam according to the intensity of the interference pattern  an environment which provides sufficient mechanical and thermal stability that the interference pattern is stable during the time in which the interference pattern is recorded 20  These requirements are inter related  and it is essential to understand the nature of optical interference to see this  Interference is the variation in intensity which can occur when two light waves are superimposed  The intensity of the maxima exceeds the sum of the individual intensities of the two beams  and the intensity at the minima is less than this and may be zero  The interference pattern maps the relative phase between the two waves  and any change in the relative phases causes the interference pattern to move across the field of view  If the relative phase of the two waves changes by one cycle  then the pattern drifts by one whole fringe  One phase cycle corresponds to a change in the relative distances travelled by the two beams of one wavelength  Since the wavelength of light is of the order of 0 5 m  it can be seen that very small changes in the optical paths travelled by either of the beams in the holographic recording system lead to movement of the interference pattern which is the holographic recording  Such changes can be caused by relative movements of any of the optical components or the object itself  and also by local changes in air temperature  It is essential that any such changes are significantly less than the wavelength of light if a clear well defined recording of the interference is to be created  The exposure time required to record the hologram depends on the laser power available  on the particular medium used and on the size and nature of the object s  to be recorded  just as in conventional photography  This determines the stability requirements  Exposure times of several minutes are typical when using quite powerful gas lasers and silver halide emulsions  All the elements within the optical system have to be stable to fractions of a  m over that period  It is possible to make holograms of much less stable objects by using a pulsed laser which produces a large amount of energy in a very short time   s or less   21  These systems have been used to produce holograms of live people  A holographic portrait of Dennis Gabor was produced in 1971 using a pulsed ruby laser  22  23  Thus  the laser power  recording medium sensitivity  recording time and mechanical and thermal stability requirements are all interlinked  Generally  the smaller the object  the more compact the optical layout  so that the stability requirements are significantly less than when making holograms of large objects  Another very important laser parameter is its coherence  24  This be envisaged by considering a laser to produce a sine wave whose frequency drifts over time  the coherence length can then be considered to be the distance over which it maintains a single frequency  This is important because two waves of different frequencies do not produce a stable interference pattern  The coherence length of the laser determines the depth of field which can be recorded in the scene  A good holography laser will typically have a coherence length of several meters  ample for a deep hologram  The objects that form the scene must  in general  have optically rough surfaces so that they scatter light over a wide range of angles  A specularly reflecting  or shiny  surface reflects the light in only one direction at each point on its surface  so in general  most of the light will not be incident on the recording medium  Holograms of flat shiny objects have been made by locating it very close to the recording plate  25   edit  Hologram classifications There are three important properties of a hologram which are defined in this section  A given hologram will have one or other of each of these three properties  e g  we can have an amplitude modulated thin transmission hologram  or a phase modulated  volume reflection hologram  it is made up of virtual systems   edit  Amplitude and phase modulation holograms An amplitude modulation hologram is one where the amplitude of light diffracted by the hologram is proportional to the intensity of the recorded light  A straightforward example of this is photographic emulsion on a transparent substrate  The emulsion is exposed to the interference pattern  and is subsequently developed giving a transmittance which varies with the intensity of the pattern   the more light that fell on the plate at a given point  the darker the developed plate at that point  A phase hologram is made by changing either the thickness or the refractive index of the material in proportion to the intensity of the holographic interference pattern  This is a phase grating and it can be shown that when such a plate is illuminated by the original reference beam  it reconstructs the original object wavefront  The efficiency  i e  the fraction of the illuminated beam which is converted to reconstructed object beam  is greater for phase than for amplitude modulated holograms   edit  Thin holograms and thick  volume  holograms A thin hologram is one where the thickness of the recording medium is much less than the spacing of the interference fringes which make up the holographic recording  A thick or volume hologram is one where the thickness of the recording medium is greater than the spacing of the interference pattern  The recorded hologram is now a three dimensional structure  and it can be shown that incident light is diffracted by the grating only at a particular angle  known as the Bragg angle  26  If the hologram is illuminated with a light source incident at the original reference beam angle but a broad spectrum of wavelengths  reconstruction occurs only at the wavelength of the original laser used  If the angle of illumination is changed  reconstruction will occur at a different wavelength and the colour of the re consturcted scene changes  A volume hologram effectively acts as a colour filter   edit  Transmission and reflection holograms A transmission hologram is one where the object and reference beams are incident on the recording medium from the same side  In practice  several more mirrors may be used to direct the beams in the required directions  Normally  transmission holograms can only be reconstructed using a laser or a quasi monochromatic source  but a particular type of transmission hologram  known as a rainbow hologram  can be viewed with white light  In a reflection hologram  the object and reference beams are incident on the plate from opposite sides of the plate  The reconstructed object is then viewed from the same side of the plate as that at which the re constructing beam is incident  Only volume holograms can be used to make reflection holograms  as only a very low intensity diffracted beam would be reflected by a thin hologram   edit  Holographic recording media The recording medium has to convert the original interference pattern into an optical element that modifies either the amplitude or the phase of an incident light beam in proportion to the intensity of the original light field  The recording medium should be able to resolve fully all the fringes arising from interference between object and reference beam  These fringe spacings can range from tens of microns to less than one micron  i e  spatial frequencies ranging from a few hundred to several thousand cycles mm  and ideally  the recording medium should have a response which is flat over this range  If the response of the medium to these spatial frequencies is low  the diffraction efficiency of the hologram will be poor and a dim image will be obtained  It should be noted that standard photographic film has a very low  or even zero  response at the frequencies involved and cannot be used to make a hologram   see  for example  Kodak s professional black and white film 27  whose resolution starts falling off at 20 lines mm and it is unlikely than any reconstructed beam would be obtained using this film  If the response is not flat over the range of spatial frequencies in the interference pattern  then the resolution of the reconstructed image may also be degraded  28  29  The table below shows the principal materials used for holographic recording  Note that these do not include the materials used in the mass replication of an existing hologram which are discussed in the next section  The resolution limit given in the table indicates the maximal number of interference lines mm of the gratings  The required exposure is for a long exposure  Short exposure times  less than 1 1000 of a second  such as with a pulsed laser  require a higher exposure due to reciprocity failure  General properties of recording materials for holography  Source  30  Material Reusable Processing Type of hologram Theoretical maximum efficiency Required

production An existing hologram can be replicated  either optically  similar to holographic recording or in the case of surface relief holograms  by embossing  31  Surface relief holograms are recorded in photoresists or photothermoplastics and allow cheap mass reproduction  Such embossed holograms are now widely used  for instance  as security features on credit cards or quality merchandise  The Royal Canadian Mint even produces holographic gold and silver coinage through a complex stamping process  32  The first book to feature a hologram on the front cover was The Skook  Warner Books  1984  by JP Miller  featuring an illustration by Miller  That same year   Telstar  by Ad Infinitum became the first record with a hologram cover and National Geographic published the first magazine with a hologram cover  33  The first step in the embossing process is to make a stamper by electrodeposition of nickel on the relief image recorded on the photoresist or photothermoplastic  When the nickel layer is thick enough  it is separated from the master hologram and mounted on a metal backing plate  The material used to make embossed copies consists of a polyester base film  a resin separation layer and a thermoplastic film constituting the holographic layer  The embossing process can be carried out with a simple heated press  The bottom layer of the duplicating film  the thermoplastic layer  is heated above its softening point and pressed against the stamper  so that it takes up its shape  This shape is retained when the film is cooled and removed from the press  In order to permit the viewing of embossed holograms in reflection  an additional reflecting layer of aluminum is usually added on the hologram recording layer  Embossed holograms are used widely on credit cards  banknotes  and high value products  34  It is possible to print holograms directly into steel using a sheet explosive charge to create the required surface relief  35   edit  Reconstructing and viewing the holographic image When the hologram plate is illuminated by a laser beam identical to the reference beam which was used to record the hologram  an exact reconstruction of the original object wavefront is obtained  An imaging system  an eye or a camera  located in the reconstructed beam  sees  exactly the same scene as it would have done when viewing the original  When the lens is moved  the image changes in the same way as it would have done when the object was in place  If several objects were present when the hologram was recorded  the reconstructed objects move relative to one another  i e  exhibit parallax  in the same way as the original objects would have done  It was very common in the early days of holography to use a chess board as the object and then take photographs at several different angles using the reconstructed light to show how the relative positions of the chess pieces appeared to change  A holographic image can also be obtained using a different laser beam configuration to the original recording object beam  but the reconstructed image will not match the original exactly  36  When a laser is used to reconstruct the hologram  the image is speckled just as the original image will have been  This can be a major drawback in viewing a hologram  White light consists of light of a wide range of wavelengths  Normally  if a hologram is illuminated by a white light source  each wavelength can be considered to generate its own holographic reconstruction  and these will vary in size  angle  and distance  These will be superimposed  and the summed image will wipe out any information about the original scene  just as if you superimposed a set of photographs of the same object of different sizes and orientations  However  a holographic image can be obtained using white light in specific circumstances  e g  with volume holograms and rainbow holograms The white light source used to view these holograms should always approximate to a point source  i e  a spot light or the sun  An extended source  e g  a fluorescent lamp  will not reconstruct a hologram since it light is incident at each point at a wide range of angles  giving multiple reconstructions which will  wipe  one another out  White light reconstructions do not contain speckles   edit  Volume holograms A volume hologram can give a reconstructed beam using white light  as the hologram structure effectively filters out colours other than those equal to or very close to the colour of the laser used to make the hologram so that the reconstructed image will appear to be approximately the same colour as the laser light used to create the holographic recording   edit  Rainbow holograms Main article  Rainbow hologram Rainbow hologram showing the change in colour in the vertical direction In this method  parallax in the vertical plane is sacrificed to allow a bright well defined single colour re constructed image to be obtained using white light  The rainbow holography recording process uses a horizontal slit to eliminate vertical parallax in the output image  The viewer is then effectively viewing the holographic image through a narrow horizontal slit  Horizontal parallax information is preserved but movement in the vertical direction produces colour rather than different vertical perspectives  37 Stereopsis and horizontal motion parallax  two relatively powerful cues to depth  are preserved  The holograms found on credit cards are examples of rainbow holograms  These are technically transmission holograms mounted onto a reflective surface like a metalized polyethylene terephthalate substrate commonly known as PET   edit  Fidelity of the reconstructed beam Reconstructions from two parts of a broken hologram  Note the different viewpoints required to see the whole object To replicate the original object beam exactly  the reconstructing reference beam must be identical to the original reference beam and the recording medium must be able to fully resolve the interference pattern formed between the object and reference beams  Exact reconstruction is required in holographic interferometry  where the holographically reconstructed wavefront interferes with the wavefront coming from the actual object  giving a null fringe if there has been no movement of the object and mapping out the displacement if the object has moved  This requires very precise relocation of the developed holographic plate  Any change in the shape  orientation or wavelength of the reference beam gives rise to aberrations in the reconstructed image  For instance  the reconstructed image is magnified if the laser used to reconstruct the hologram has a shorter wavelength than the original laser  Nonetheless  good reconstruction is obtained using a laser of a different wavelength  quasi monochromatic light or white light  in the right circumstances  Since each point in the object illuminates all of the hologram  the whole object can be reconstructed from a small part of the hologram  Thus  a hologram can be broken up into small pieces and each one will enable the whole of the original object to be imaged  One does  however  lose information and the spatial resolution gets worse as the size of the hologram is decreased   the image becomes  fuzzier   The field of view is also reduced  and the viewer will have to change position to see different parts of the scene   edit  Applications  edit  Art Early on  artists saw the potential of holography as a medium and gained access to science laboratories to create their work  Holographic art is often the result of collaborations between scientists and artists  although some holographers would regard themselves as both an artist and a scientist  Salvador Dal  claimed to have been the first to employ holography artistically  He was certainly the first and best known surrealist to do so  but the 1972 New York exhibit of Dal  holograms had been preceded by the holographic art exhibition that was held at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan in 1968 and by the one at the Finch College gallery in New York in 1970  which attracted national media attention  38  During the 1970s  a number of art studios and schools were established  each with their particular approach to holography  Notably  there was the San Francisco School of Holography established by Lloyd Cross  The Museum of Holography in New York founded by Rosemary  Possie  H  Jackson  the Royal College of Art in London and the Lake Forest College Symposiums organised by Tung Jeong  T J    39  None of these studios still exist  however  there is the Center for the Holographic Arts in New York 40  and the HOLOcenter in Seoul  41  which offers artists a place to create and exhibit work  During the 1980s  many artists who worked with holography helped the diffusion of this so called  new medium  in the art world  such as Harriet Casdin Silver of the USA  Dieter Jung of Germany  and Moys s Baumstein of Brazil  each one searching for a proper  language  to use with the three dimensional work  avoiding the simple holographic reproduction of a sculpture or object  For instance  in Brazil  many concrete poets  Augusto de Campos  D cio Pignatari  Julio Plaza and Jos  Wagner Garcia  associated with Moys s Baumstein  found in holography a way to express themselves and to renew the Concrete Poetry  or Shape Poetry   A small but active group of artists still use holography as their main medium  and many more artists integrate holographic elements into their work  42  Some are associated with novel holographic techniques  for example  artist Matt Brand 43  employed computational mirror design to eliminate image distortion from specular holography  The MIT Museum 44  and Jonathan Ross 45  both have extensive collections of holography and on line catalogues of art holograms   edit  Data storage Main article  Holographic memory Holography can be put to a variety of uses other than recording images  Holographic data storage is a technique that can store information at high density inside crystals or photopolymers  The ability to store large amounts of information in some kind of media is of great importance  as many electronic products incorporate storage devices  As current storage techniques such as Blu ray Disc reach the limit of possible data density  due to the diffraction limited size of the writing beams   holographic storage has the potential to become the next generation of popular storage media  The advantage of this type of data storage is that the volume of the recording media is used instead of just the surface  Currently available SLMs can produce about 1000 different images a second at 1024 1024 bit resolution  With the right type of media  probably polymers rather than something like LiNbO3   this would result in about one gigabit per second writing speed  Read speeds can surpass this  and experts believe one terabit per second readout is possible  In 2005  companies such as Optware and Maxell produced a 120 mm disc that uses a holographic layer to store data to a potential 3 9 TB  which they plan to market under the name Holographic Versatile Disc  Another company  InPhase Technologies  is developing a competing format  While many holographic data storage models have used  page based  storage  where each recorded hologram holds a large amount of data  more recent research into using submicrometre sized  microholograms  has resulted in several potential 3D optical data storage solutions  While this approach to data storage can not attain the high data rates of page based storage  the tolerances  technological hurdles  and cost of producing a commercial product are significantly lower   edit  Dynamic holography In static holography  recording  developing and reconstructing occur sequentially  and a permanent hologram is produced  There also exist holographic materials that do not need the developing process and can record a hologram in a very short time  This allows one to use holography to perform some simple operations in an all optical way  Examples of applications of such real time holograms include phase conjugate mirrors   time reversal  of light   optical cache memories  image processing  pattern recognition of time varying images   and optical computing  The amount of processed information can be very high  terabits s   since the operation is performed in parallel on a whole image  This compensates for the fact that the recording time  which is in the order of a microsecond  is still very long compared to the processing time of an electronic computer  The optical processing performed by a dynamic hologram is also much less flexible than electronic processing  On one side  one has to perform the operation always on the whole image  and on the other side  the operation a hologram can perform is basically either a multiplication or a phase conjugation  In optics  addition and Fourier transform are already easily performed in linear materials  the latter simply by a lens  This enables some applications  such as a device that compares images in an optical way  46  The search for novel nonlinear optical materials for dynamic holography is an active area of research  The most common materials are photorefractive crystals  but in semiconductors or semiconductor heterostructures  such as quantum wells   atomic vapors and gases  plasmas and even liquids  it was possible to generate holograms  A particularly promising application is optical phase conjugation  It allows the removal of the wavefront distortions a light beam receives when passing through an aberrating medium  by sending it back through the same aberrating medium with a conjugated phase  This is useful  for example  in free space optical communications to compensate for atmospheric turbulence  the phenomenon that gives rise to the twinkling of starlight    edit  Hobbyist use Peace Within Reach  a Denisyuk DCG hologram by amateur Dave Battin Since the beginning of holography  experimenters have explored its uses  Starting in 1971  Lloyd Cross started the San Francisco School of Holography and started to teach amateurs the methods of making holograms with inexpensive equipment  This method relied on the use of a large table of deep sand to hold the optics rigid and damp vibrations that would destroy the image  Many of these holographers would go on to produce art holograms  In 1983  Fred Unterseher published the Holography Handbook  a remarkably easy to read description of making holograms at home  This brought in a new wave of holographers and gave simple methods to use the then available AGFA silver halide recording materials  In 2000  Frank DeFreitas published the Shoebox Holography Book and introduced the use of inexpensive laser pointers to countless hobbyists  This was a very important development for amateurs  as the cost for a 5 mW laser dropped from  1200 to  5 as semiconductor laser diodes reached mass market  Now  there are hundreds to thousands of amateur holographers worldwide  In 2006  a large number of surplus Holography Quality Green Lasers  Coherent C315  became available and put Dichromated Gelatin  DCG  within the reach of the amateur holographer  The holography community was surprised at the amazing sensitivity of DCG to green light  It had been assumed that the sensitivity would be non existent  Jeff Blyth responded with the G307 formulation of DCG to increase the speed and sensitivity to these new lasers  47  Many film suppliers have come and gone from the silver halide market  While more film manufactures have filled in the voids  many amateurs are now making their own film  The favorite formulations are Dichromated Gelatin  Methylene Blue Sensitised Dichromated Gelatin and Diffusion Method Silver Halide preparations  Jeff Blyth has published very accurate methods for making film in a small lab or garage  48  A small group of amateurs are even constructing their own pulsed lasers to make holograms of moving objects  49  Holography kits with self developing film plates have now entered the consumer market  The kits make holographs and have been found to be fairly error tolerant  50  and enable holograms to be made without any other specialized equipment   edit  Holographic interferometry Main article  holographic interferometry Holographic interferometry  HI  is a technique that enables static and dynamic displacements of objects with optically rough surfaces to be measured to optical interferometric precision  i e  to fractions of a wavelength of light   51  52  It can also be used to detect optical path length variations in transparent media  which enables  for example  fluid flow to be visualized and analyzed  It can also be used to generate contours representing the form of the surface  It has been widely used to measure stress  strain  and vibration in engineering structures   edit  Interferometric microscopy Main article  Interferometric microscopy The hologram keeps the information on the amplitude and phase of the field  Several holograms may keep information about the same distribution of light  emitted to various directions  The numerical analysis of such holograms allows one to emulate large numerical aperture  which  in turn  enables enhancement of the resolution of optical microscopy  The corresponding technique is called interferometric microscopy  Recent achievements of interferometric microscopy allow one to approach the quarter wavelength limit of resolution  53   edit  Sensors or biosensors Main article  Holographic sensor The hologram is made with a modified material that interacts with certain molecules generating a change in the fringe periodicity or refractive index  therefore  the color of the holographic reflection  54   edit  Security Main article  Security hologram Identigram as a security element in a German identity card UBS Kinebar gold bars use kinegrams as a security measure  Security holograms are very difficult to forge  because they are replicated from a master hologram that requires expensive  specialized and technologically advanced equipment  They are used widely in many currencies  such as the Brazilian real 20 note  British pound 5 10 20 notes  Estonian kroon 25 50 100 500 notes  Canadian dollar 5 10 20 50 100 notes  Euro 5 10 20 50 100 200 500 notes  South Korean won 5000 10000 50000 notes  and Japanese yen 5000 10000 notes  They are also used in credit and bank cards as well as passports  ID cards  books  DVDs  and sports equipment   edit  Other applications Holographic scanners are in use in post offices  larger shipping firms  and automated conveyor systems to determine the three dimensional size of a package  They are often used in tandem with checkweighers to allow automated pre packing of given volumes  such as a truck or pallet for bulk shipment of goods  Holograms produced in elastomers can be used as stress strain reporters due to its elasticity and compressibility  the pressure and force applied are correlated to the reflected wavelength  therefore its color  55   edit  Non optical holography In principle  it is possible to make a hologram for any wave  Electron holography is the application of holography techniques to electron waves rather than light waves  Electron holography was invented by Dennis Gabor to improve the resolution and avoid the aberrations of the transmission electron microscope  Today it is commonly used to study electric and magnetic fields in thin films  as magnetic and electric fields can shift the phase of the interfering wave passing through the sample  56  The principle of electron holography can also be applied to interference lithography  57  Acoustic holography is a method used to estimate the sound field near a source by measuring acoustic parameters away from the source via an array of pressure and or particle velocity transducers  Measuring techniques included within acoustic holography are becoming increasingly popular in various fields  most notably those of transportation  vehicle and aircraft design  and NVH  The general idea of acoustic holography has led to different versions such as near field acoustic holography  NAH  and statistically optimal near field acoustic holography  SONAH   For audio rendition  the wave field synthesis is the most related procedure  Atomic holography has evolved out of the development of the basic elements of atom optics  With the Fresnel diffraction lens and atomic mirrors atomic holography follows a natural step in the development of the physics  and applications  of atomic beams  Recent developments including atomic mirrors and especially ridged mirrors have provided the tools necessary for the creation of atomic holograms  58  although such holograms have not yet been commercialized   edit  Things often confused with holograms Effects produced by Lenticular printing and Video projection  Pepper s Ghost  or modern variants such as the Musion Eyeliner   and Volumetric Projections are often confused with holograms  59  In 2010  there was a series of concerts organized by Crypton Future Media which included Hatsune Miku  a singing synthesizer application with a female persona  performing on stage as a  holographic  character  60  61  62  This effect was actually achieved through a special method of rear projection against a semi transparent screen  In 2011  in Beijing  apparel company Burberry produced the  Burberry Prorsum Autumn Winter 2011 Hologram Runway Show   which included life size 2 D projections of models  The company s own video shows several centered and off center shots of the main 2 dimensional projection screen  and all the 3 D effects stem from 2 D perspective  63  The claim that holography was used was reported as fact in the trade media  64   edit  Holography in fiction  dubious   discuss  See also  Category Holography in fiction Holograms are often used as plot devices in science fiction  The Carpathian Castle  1893
