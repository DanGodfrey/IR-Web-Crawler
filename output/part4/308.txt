character first appeared in Whiz Comics  2  February 1940   With a premise that taps adolescent fantasy  Captain Marvel is the alter ego of Billy Batson  a youth who works as a radio news reporter and was chosen to be a champion of good by the wizard Shazam  Whenever Billy speaks the wizard s name  he is struck by a magic lightning bolt that transforms him into an adult superhero empowered with the abilities of six archetypal figures  1  Several friends and family members  most notably Marvel Family cohorts Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel Jr   can share Billy s power and become  Marvels  themselves  Hailed as  The World s Mightiest Mortal  in his adventures  Captain Marvel was nicknamed  The Big Red Cheese  by arch villain Doctor Sivana  an epithet later adopted by Captain Marvel s fans  Based on sales  Captain Marvel was the most popular superhero of the 1940s  as his Captain Marvel Adventures comic book series sold more copies than Superman and other competing superhero books during the mid 1940s  2  3  Captain Marvel was also the first comic book superhero to be adapted to film  in a 1941 Republic Pictures serial titled Adventures of Captain Marvel  Fawcett ceased publishing Captain Marvel related comics in 1953  due in part to a copyright infringement suit from DC Comics alleging that Captain Marvel was an illegal infringement of Superman  In 1972  DC licensed the Marvel Family characters and returned them to publication  acquiring all rights to the characters by 1991  DC has since integrated Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family into their DC Universe  and have attempted to revive the property several times  However  Captain Marvel has not regained widespread appeal with new generations  although a Shazam  live action Saturday morning television series featuring the character ran for three seasons on CBS in the 1970s  Because Marvel Comics trademarked their Captain Marvel comic book during the interim between the original Captain Marvel s Fawcett years and DC years  DC Comics is unable to promote and market their Captain Marvel Marvel Family properties under that name  Since 1972  DC has instead used the trademark Shazam  as the title of their comic books and thus the name under which they market and promote the character  Consequently  Captain Marvel himself is frequently erroneously referred to as  Shazam   Captain Marvel was ranked as the 55th greatest comic book character of all time by Wizard magazine  4 IGN also ranked Captain Marvel as the 50th greatest comic book hero of all time stating that Captain Marvel will always be an enduring reminder of a simpler time  5 UGO Networks also placed him as one of the top heroes of entertainment quoting   At his best  Shazam has always been Superman with a sense of crazy  goofy fun

Beck  After the success of National Comics  new superhero characters Superman and Batman  Fawcett Publications in 1939 started its own comics division  Fawcett recruited writer Bill Parker to create several hero characters for the first title in their line  tentatively titled Flash Comics  Besides penning stories featuring Ibis the Invincible  Spy Smasher  Golden Arrow  Lance O Casey  Scoop Smith  and Dan Dare for the new book  Parker also wrote a story about a team of six superheroes  each possessing a special power granted to them by a mythological figure  Fawcett Comics  executive director Ralph Daigh decided it would be best to combine the team of six into one hero who would embody all six powers  Parker responded by creating a character he called  Captain Thunder   7  Staff artist Charles Clarence  C  C   Beck was recruited to design and illustrate Parker s story  rendering it in a direct  somewhat cartoony style that became his trademark  The first issue of the comic book  printed as both Flash Comics  1 and Thrill Comics  1  had a low print run in the fall of 1939 as an ashcan copy created for advertising and trademark purposes  Shortly after its printing  however  Fawcett found it could not trademark  Captain Thunder    Flash Comics   or  Thrill Comics   because all three names were already in use  Consequently  the book was renamed Whiz Comics  and Fawcett artist Pete Costanza suggested changing Captain Thunder s name to  Captain Marvelous   which the editors shortened to  Captain Marvel   The word balloons in the story were re lettered to label the hero of the main story as  Captain Marvel   Whiz Comics  2  cover dated Feb  1940  was published in late 1939  Inspirations for Captain Marvel came from a number of sources  His visual appearance was modeled after that of Fred MacMurray  a popular American actor of the period   8  though comparisons to both Cary Grant and Jack Oakie were made as well  9  Fawcett Publications  founder  Wilford H  Fawcett  was nicknamed  Captain Billy   which inspired the name  Billy Batson  and Marvel s title as well  10  Fawcett s earliest magazine was titled Captain Billy s Whiz Bang  which inspired the title Whiz Comics  11  In addition  Fawcett adapted several of the elements that had made Superman  the first popular comic book superhero  popular  super strength and speed  science fiction stories  a mild mannered reporter alter ego   and incorporated them into Captain Marvel  Fawcett s circulation director Roscoe Kent Fawcett recalled telling the staff   give me a Superman  only have his other identity be a 10  or 12 year old boy rather than a man   12  Whiz Comics  22  Oct  1941   featuring Captain Marvel and his young alter ego  Billy Batson  As a result  Captain Marvel was given a twelve year old boy named Billy Batson as his alter ego  In the origin story printed in Whiz Comics  2  Billy  a homeless newsboy  is led by a mysterious stranger to a secret subway tunnel  An odd subway car with no visible driver takes them past Seven statues depicting the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man  Pride  Envy  Greed  Hatred  Selfishness  Laziness and Injustice  to the lair of the wizard Shazam  who grants Billy the power to become the adult superhero Captain Marvel and shows him his life  after which a stone above Shazam s head crushes him  although his ghost says he will give advice when a brazier is lighted  In order to transform into Captain Marvel  Billy must speak the wizard s name  an acronym for the six various legendary figures who had agreed to grant aspects of themselves to a willing subject  the wisdom of Solomon  the strength of Hercules  the stamina of Atlas  the power of Zeus  the courage of Achilles  and the speed of Mercury  Speaking the word produces a bolt of magic lightning which transforms Billy into Captain Marvel  speaking the word again reverses the transformation with another bolt of lightning  Captain Marvel wore a bright red costume with gold trim and a yellow lightning bolt insignia on the chest  The body suit originally included a partial bib front  but was changed to a one piece skintight suit within a year  In 1994  the DC Comics version of the costume had the partial bib restored  The costume also included a white collared cape trimmed with gold flower symbols  usually asymmetrically thrown over the left shoulder and held around his neck by a gold cord  The cape came from the ceremonial cape worn by the British nobility  13  photographs of which appeared in newspapers in the 1930s  In addition to introducing the main character and his alter ego  Captain Marvel s first adventure in Whiz Comics  2 also introduced his archenemy  the evil Doctor Sivana  and found Billy Batson talking his way into a job as an on air radio reporter  Captain Marvel was an instant success  with Whiz Comics  2 selling over 500 000 copies  3  By 1941  he had his own solo series  Captain Marvel Adventures  while continuing to appear in Whiz Comics as well  He also made periodic appearances in other Fawcett books  including Master Comics   edit  Fawcett years  The Marvel Family  allies  and enemies Through his adventures  Captain Marvel soon gained a host of enemies  His most frequent foe was Doctor Sivana  a mad scientist who was determined to rule the world  yet was thwarted by Captain Marvel at every turn  He had two non evil children  the beautiful Beautia  who loved Captain Marvel  and the superstrong Magnificus  Sivana s evil children  Georgia and Sivana  Jr   were later introduced to the comics  and they resembled their father both physically and mentally  Marvel s other villains included Adolf Hitler s champion Captain Nazi  an older Egyptian renegade Marvel called Black Adam  whose sole Golden Age appearance was in Marvel Family  1   an evil magic powered brute named Ibac  who gained powers from historical villains  and an artificially intelligent nuclear powered robot called Mister Atom  The most notorious Captain Marvel villains  however  were the nefarious Mister Mind and his Monster Society of Evil  which recruited several of Marvel s previous adversaries  The  Monster Society of Evil  story arc ran as a twenty five chapter serial in Captain Marvel Adventures  22 46  March 1943   May 1945   with Mister Mind eventually revealed to be a highly intelligent yet tiny worm from another planet  The Monster Society was the first criminal group in comics with members from past stories  including Sivana  Ibac  and Captain Nazi  along with new foes  like Herkimer the crocodile man and a multi headed Hydra  Even Hitler  Mussolini and Tojo were members  along with other Nazis  The Society tried many plans  firstly trying to use Captain Nazi to steal magic fortune telling pearls  using a film to intimidate the world  and even trying to use a giant cannon to blow holes in countries  Mr  Mind is eventually executed in the electric chair for 186 744 murders at the end of the arc  but would be reintroduced decades later in DC Comics  Shazam   2  In the early 1940s  Captain Marvel also gained allies in the Marvel Family  a collective of superheroes with powers and or costumes similar to Captain Marvel s   By comparison  Superman spin off character Superboy first appeared in 1944  while Supergirl first appeared in 1959   Whiz Comics  21  September 1941  marked the debut of the Lieutenant Marvels  the alter egos of three other boys  all also named Billy Batson  who found that  by saying  Shazam   in unison  they too could become Marvels  In Whiz Comics  25  December 1941   a friend named Freddy Freeman  mortally wounded by an attack from Captain Nazi  was given the power to become teenage boy superhero Captain Marvel  Jr   with a distinctive gold on blue version of the Marvel costume  A year later in Captain Marvel Adventures  18  December 1942   Billy and Freddy met Billy s long lost twin sister Mary Bromfield  who discovered she could  by saying the magic word  Shazam   become the teenaged superheroine Mary Marvel  although the pre Crisis Mary Marvel got her power from  goddesses   Detail from The Marvel Family  2  June 1946   cover art by C  C  Beck  From left to right

Marvel  and Captain Marvel  Jr   were featured as a team in a new comic series entitled The Marvel Family  This was published alongside the other Captain Marvel related titles  which now included Wow Comics featuring Mary  Master Comics featuring Junior  and both Mary Marvel Comics and Captain Marvel Jr  Comics  Non super powered Marvels such as the  lovable con artist  Uncle Marvel and his niece  Freckles Marvel  also sometimes joined the other Marvels on their adventures  A funny animal spin off  Hoppy the Marvel Bunny  was created in 1942 for Fawcett s Funny Animals comics  and later given a series of his own  As with other superheroes  Captain Marvel had a number of non powered friends and associates as well  These included Mr  Morris  Billy s employer at WHIZ radio  Joan Jameson  Billy s secretary  and one of the few people to know his secret identity   Beautia Sivana  Dr  Sivana s good natured adult daughter who had a crush on Captain Marvel and only periodically joined forces with her father  and usually by force   and Dexter Knox  an intelligent young scientist who was a friend of Billy s friends  The most prolific of Captain Marvel s supporting characters at Fawcett was Mister Tawky Tawny  an anthropomorphic tiger who d been fed a serum that allowed him to learn to speak and stand upright  citation needed  The members of the Marvel Family often teamed up with the other Fawcett superheroes  who included Ibis the Invincible  Bulletman and Bulletgirl  Spy Smasher  Minute Man  and Mr  Scarlet and Pinky  Among the many artists and writers who worked on the Marvel Family stories alongside C  C  Beck and main writer Otto Binder were Joe Simon and Jack Kirby  Mac Raboy  Pete Costanza  Kurt Schaffenberger  and Marc Swayze   edit  Copyright infringement lawsuit and cancellation See also  National Comics Publications v  Fawcett Publications Through much of the Golden Age of Comic Books  Captain Marvel proved to be the most popular superhero character of the medium with his comics outselling all others  including those featuring Superman  In fact  Captain Marvel Adventures sold fourteen million copies in 1944  14  and was at one point being published bi weekly with a circulation of 1 3 million copies an issue  proclaimed on the cover of issue  19 as being the  Largest Circulation of Any Comic Magazine    3  Part of the reason for this popularity included the inherent wish fulfillment appeal of the character to children  as well as the humorous and surreal quality of the stories  Billy Batson typically narrated each Captain Marvel story  speaking directly to his reading audience from his WHIZ radio microphone  relating each story from the perspective of a young boy  Detective Comics  later known as National Comics Publications  National Periodical Publications  and today known as DC Comics  sued Fawcett Comics for copyright infringement in 1941  alleging that Captain Marvel was based on their character Superman  After seven years of litigation  the National Comics Publications v  Fawcett Publications case went to trials court in 1948  Although the judge presiding over the case decided that Captain Marvel was an infringement  DC was found to be negligent in copyrighting several of their Superman daily newspaper strips  and it was decided that National had abandoned the Superman copyright  15  As a result  the initial verdict  delivered in 1951  was decided in Fawcett s favor  National appealed this decision  and Judge Learned Hand declared in 1952 that National s Superman copyright was in fact valid  Judge Hand did not find that the character of Captain Marvel itself was an infringement  but rather that specific stories or super feats could be infringements  and that the truth of this would have to be determined in a re trial of the case  The judge therefore sent the matter back to the lower court for final determination  15  Instead of retrying the case  however  Fawcett decided to settle with National out of court  The National lawsuit was not the only problem Fawcett faced in regards to Captain Marvel  While Captain Marvel Adventures had been the top selling comic series during World War II  it suffered declining sales every year after 1945 and by 1949 it was selling only half its wartime rate  16  Fawcett tried to revive the popularity of its assorted Captain Marvel series in the early 1950s by introducing elements of the horror comics trend that gained popularity at the time  17  Feeling that a decline in the popularity of superhero comics meant that it was no longer worth continuing the fight  18  Fawcett agreed to never again publish a comic book featuring any of the Captain Marvel related characters  and to pay National  400 000 in damages  19  Fawcett shut down its comics division in the autumn of 1953 and laid off its comic creating staff  Whiz Comics had ended with issue  155 in June 1953  Captain Marvel Adventures was canceled with  150  November 1953   and The Marvel Family ended its run with  89  January 1954    edit  Marvelman  and Miracleman  Main article  Marvelman In the 1950s  a small British publisher  L  Miller and Son  published a number of black and white reprints of American comic books  including the Captain Marvel series  With the outcome of the National v  Fawcett lawsuit  L  Miller and Son found their supply of Captain Marvel material abruptly cut off  They requested the help of a British comic writer  Mick Anglo  who created a thinly disguised version of the superhero called Marvelman  Captain Marvel  Jr   was adapted to create Young Marvelman  while Mary Marvel had her gender changed to create the male Kid Marvelman  The magic word  Shazam   was replaced with  Kimota   Atomik  spelt backwards  The new characters took over the numbering of the original Captain Marvel s United Kingdom series with issue number  25  Marvelman ceased publication in 1963  but was revived in 1982 by writer Alan Moore in the pages of Warrior Magazine  Beginning in 1985  Moore s black and white serialized adventures were reprinted in color by Eclipse Comics under the new title Miracleman  as Marvel Comics now existed and objected to the use of  Marvel  in the title   and continued publication in the United States after Warrior s demise  Within the metatextual storyline of the comic series itself  it was noted that Marvelman s creation was based upon Captain Marvel comics  by both Alan Moore and later Marvelman Miracleman writer Neil Gaiman  In 2009  Marvel Comics obtained the rights to the original 1950s Marvelman characters and stories  20   edit  The M  F  Enterprises Captain Marvel In 1966  M  F  Enterprises produced their own Captain Marvel  an android superhero from another planet whose main characteristic was the ability to split his body into several parts  each of which could move on its own  He triggered the separation by shouting  Split   and reassembled himself by shouting  Xam   He had a young human ward named Billy Baxton  This Captain Marvel  who did not last long  was credited in the comic as being  based on a character created by Carl Burgos   21   edit  DC Comics  Shazam  revival When superhero comics became popular again in the mid 1960s in what is now called the Silver Age of Comic Books  Fawcett was unable to revive Captain Marvel  having agreed never to publish the character again in order to settle the lawsuit  Carmine Infantino  publisher of DC Comics  licensed the characters from Fawcett in 1972  and DC began planning a revival  Because Marvel Comics had by this time established Captain Marvel as a comic book trademark  DC published their book under the name Shazam  Since then  that title has become so linked to Captain Marvel that many people have taken to identifying the character as  Shazam  instead of his actual name  The Shazam  comic series began with Shazam  1  dated February 1973  It contained both new stories and reprints from the 1940s and 1950s  The first story attempted to explain the Marvel Family s absence by stating that they  Dr  Sivana  Sivana s children  and most of the supporting cast had been accidentally trapped in suspended animation for twenty years when the Sivanas attempted to put the Marvels into suspended animation  until finally breaking free when the Suspendium globe moved towards the Sun  Dennis O Neil was the primary writer of the book  22  his role was later taken over by writers Elliot S  Maggin and E  Nelson Bridwell  C  C  Beck drew stories for the first ten issues of the book before quitting due to creative differences  Bob Oksner and Fawcett alumnus Kurt Schaffenberger were among the later artists of the title  With DC s Multiverse concept in effect during this time  it was stated that the revived Marvel Family and related characters lived within the DC Universe on the parallel world of  Earth S   While the series began with a great deal of fanfare  the book had a lackluster reception  The creators themselves had misgivings  Beck said   As an illustrator I could  in the old days  make a good story better by bringing it to life with drawings  But I couldn t bring the new  Captain Marvel  stories to life no matter how hard I tried   23 Shazam  was heavily rewritten as of issue  34  April 1978   with Bridwell providing more realistic stories  accompanied by similar art  the first issue by Alan Weiss and Joe Rubinstein  thereafter by a longtime fan of the character  24 Don Newton and Schaffenberger  Nevertheless  the next issue was the last one  though the feature was kept alive in a back up position in a giant formatted run of World s Finest Comics  from  253  October November 1978  to  282  August 1982  skipping only  271  which featured a full length origin of the Superman Batman team story   Schaffenberger left the feature after  259  and the inking credit subsequently varied  When WFC reverted to the standard 36 pages  leftover Shazam  material saw publication in Adventure Comics   491 492  September October 1982   the remaining eleven issues of that run contained reprints  Shazam  represented by mostly Fawcett era stories  left out of an all Legion of Super Heroes  500  and the final  503  where two features were doubled up to complete their respective story arcs   With their 1985 Crisis on Infinite Earths limited series  DC fully integrated the characters into the DC Universe  With the exception of an appearance by Lex Luthor in  15  November December 1974   the early  faithful to the 1940s comics versions never crossed over with the mainstream DC characters  citation needed   edit  Captain Marvel in the late 1980s The first post Crisis appearance of Captain Marvel was in the 1986 Legends miniseries  In 1987  Captain Marvel appeared as a member of the Justice League in Keith Giffen and J  M  DeMatteis  relaunch of that title  That same year  spinning off from Legends   he was also given his own miniseries titled Shazam  The New Beginning  With this four issue miniseries  writers Roy and Dann Thomas and artist Tom Mandrake attempted to re launch the Captain Marvel mythos and bring the wizard Shazam  Dr  Sivana  Uncle Dudley  and Black Adam into the modern DC Universe with an altered origin story  The most notable change that Thomas  Giffen  and DeMatteis introduced into the Captain Marvel mythos was that the personality of young Billy Batson is retained when he transforms into the Captain  this change would remain for most future uses of the character as justification for his sunny  Golden Age personality in the darker modern day comic book world instead of the Golden Age depiction which tended to treat Captain Marvel and Billy as two separate personalities  This revised version of Captain Marvel also appeared in one story arc featured in the short lived anthology Action Comics Weekly  623 626  October 25  1988   November 15  1988   At the end of the arc  it was announced that this would lead to a new Shazam  ongoing series  which failed to materialize   edit  The Power of Shazam  Main article  The Power of Shazam  DC finally purchased the rights to all of the Fawcett Comics characters in 1991  25  In 1994  due to the unpopular revision of the character from 1987 s Shazam  The New Beginning miniseries  Captain Marvel was retconned again and given a revised origin in The Power of Shazam   a painted graphic novel written and illustrated by Jerry Ordway  This story became Captain Marvel s official DC Universe origin story  with his appearances in Legends and Justice League still counting as part of this continuity   Ordway s story more closely followed Captain Marvel s Fawcett origins  with only slight additions and changes  For example  in this version of the origin  it is Black Adam  in his non powered form of Theo Adam  who killed Billy Batson s parents  and the  mysterious stranger  who leads Billy to the subway tunnel with statues of the Sins and the wizard Shazam is revealed to be the ghost of his father  The graphic novel was a critically acclaimed success  leading to a Power of Shazam  ongoing series which ran from 1995 to 1999  26  That series reintroduced the Marvel Family and many of their allies and enemies into the modern day DC Universe  Marvel also appeared in Mark Waid and Alex Ross  critically acclaimed 1996 alternate universe Elseworlds Kingdom Come miniseries  Set twenty years in the future  Kingdom Come features a brainwashed Captain Marvel playing a major role in the story as a mind controlled pawn of an elderly Lex Luthor  Being one of the most powerful beings on Earth  his mere presence unnerves many of those around him and  brainwashed  he even sets out to cause what could lead to the end of the world  However  Marvel ultimately sacrifices himself as an act of redemption and  as a figure of martyrdom  becomes the symbol of a new world order  In 2000  Captain Marvel starred in an oversized special graphic

ally who may have similar powers to himself  but who is also far more resistant to the kind of magic attacks that he is vulnerable to  However  he is disturbed when he learns that the Captain is actually a child and agrees to Shazam s suggestion that he mentor the boy  A second Captain Marvel mini series  Shazam   The Monster Society of Evil  written and illustrated by Jeff Smith  creator of Bone   was published in four 48 page installments between February and July 2007  Smith s Shazam  miniseries  in the works since 2003  is a more traditional take on the character  which updates and reimagines Captain Marvel s origin  38  Smith s story features a younger looking Billy Batson and Captain Marvel as separate personalities  as they were in the pre 1985 stories  and features a prepubescent Mary Marvel as Captain Marvel s sidekick instead of the traditional teenaged or adult version  Dr  Sivana is Attorney General of the United States  and Mister Mind looks more like a snake than a caterpillar  An all ages Captain Marvel comic  Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam   debuted in July 2008 under DC s Johnny DC youth oriented imprint and was published monthly through December 2010  Following the lead and continuity of Smith s version  it was initially written and drawn by Mike Kunkel  creator of Herobear  39 Art Baltazar and Franco Aureliani  of Tiny Titans  took over as writers with issue  5  with Byron Vaughns as main artist until issue  13  when Mike Norton assumed his place for the rest of the series  40  Kunkel s version returns to the modern concept of having Captain Marvel retain Billy s personality  and also introduces new versions of Black Adam  whose alter ego  Theo Adam  is a child like Billy Batson in this version   King Kull  the Arson Fiend  and Freddy Freeman Captain Marvel  Jr   edit  Powers  amp  Abilities When Billy Batson says the magic word  Shazam   and transforms into Captain Marvel  he is granted the following powers  S for the wisdom of Solomon As Captain Marvel  Billy has instant access to a vast amount of scholarly knowledge  including most known languages and sciences  He has exceptional photographic recall and mental acuity allowing him to read and decipher hieroglyphics  recall everything he has ever learned and solve long mathematical equations  He also has a great understanding of divine phenomenon in the mortal world  The wisdom of Solomon also provides him with counsel and advice in times of need  In early Captain Marvel stories  Solomon s power also gave Marvel the ability to hypnotize people   Solomon is the only figure in the list not taken from Greco Roman mythology   H for the strength of Hercules Hercules  power grants Captain Marvel immense superhuman strength  making him one of DC Comics  strongest characters  he is able to easily bend steel  punch through walls  and lift massive objects   including whole continents like South America   In the comics  this strength has evolved in parallel to that of Superman  41  A for the stamina of Atlas Using Atlas  stamina  Captain Marvel can withstand and survive most types of extreme physical assaults  and heal from them  Additionally  he does not need to eat  sleep  or breathe and can survive unaided in space when in Captain Marvel form  Pre Crisis  it was implied in some stories to give him invulnerability  Z for the power of Zeus Zeus  power  besides fueling the magic thunderbolt that transforms Captain Marvel  also enhances Marvel s other physical and mental abilities  and grants him resistance against all magic spells and attacks  Marvel can use the lightning bolt as a weapon by dodging it and allowing it to strike an opponent or target  The magic lightning has several uses  such as creating apparatus  restoring damage done to Marvel  and acting as fuel for magic spells  If Billy is poisoned  for example  transforming will enable him to survive  42  Pre Crisis  it was claimed in some stories to give him invulnerabilty  43  It can also turn other Marvels back by striking them  It aids interdimensional travel at the Rock of Eternity  A for the courage of Achilles This aspect gives Captain Marvel the courage of Achilles  giving him bravery and in one story it is claimed to give him fighting skills  43  In the Trials of Shazam  mini series  this was changed to Achilles  near invulnerability  It also aids Captain Marvel s mental fortitude against most mental attacks  M for the speed of Mercury By channeling Mercury s speed  Captain Marvel can move at superhuman speeds and fly  although in older comics he could only leap great distances  This also gives Marvel the ability to fly to the Rock of Eternity by flying faster than the speed of light  Repeating the word  Shazam   transforms Captain Marvel back into Billy  In Whiz Comics  11  Billy is shown to be able to summon up a ghostly version of Captain Marvel by whispering the word  and in other stories the spirit of Captain Marvel was shown talking to Billy  Captain Marvel shares his powers with Marvel Family members Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel  Jr  In pre Crisis on Infinite Earths stories  this had no detrimental effect on the heroes  abilities  while in DC s Power of Shazam series and irregularly afterward  the Shazam power was shown to be a finite source which would be divided in half or into thirds depending upon how many Marvels were in active super powered form at one time  As he was transformed by magic lightning  Captain Marvel was shown in several stories to be susceptible to both high powered magic  which can weaken or de power him  and to significantly high voltages of electricity or lightning to revert him back to Billy Batson form  Likewise  lightning could transform Billy to Captain Marvel  44  The modern version of Captain Marvel is also vulnerable in the fact that he possesses the immature personality of a teenager  In one story it is shown that if the Elders strike their name from the list Captain Marvel loses his powers  43  If Shazam is incapitated he could not send down the lightning  though later it was shown Zeus could send it down also  43  It was claimed in some stories that he was invulnerable to every force in the universe  including shrinking rays  The white clad  Marvel  version of the character from the Trials of Shazam  series also possessed the commands of various magic abilities once owned by the wizard Shazam  However  Marvel was required to remain on the Rock of Eternity and could only be away from the Rock for twenty four hours at a time  citation needed

had been tricked by his archenemies in the Monster League of Evil into doing evil by a magic spell  and Thunder therefore was made to do battle with Superman  Captain Thunder  whose name was derived

held him while he used his wisdom to escape the effects of the spell  At the time of Superman  276  DC had been publishing Shazam  comics for two years  but had kept that universe separate from those of its other publications  The real Captain Marvel would finally meet Superman in Justice League of America  137  two years later  although he met Lex Luthor in Shazam   15  November December 1974

Flashpoint  radically different versions of Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family are introduced  The new Marvel Family consists of six children who were caught on a subway car that took them to the Rock of Eternity  and as a result each of the youths were granted with a different one of the wizard s attributes  An Asian American boy named Eugene Choi possesses the wisdom of Solomon  an overweight Latino boy named Pedro P na possesses the strength of Hercules  Mary Batson possesses the stamina of Atlas  Freddy Freeman possesses the power of Zeus  Billy Batson possesses the courage of Achilles  and an African American girl named Darla Dudley possesses the speed of Mercury  Tawky Tawny is also shown with them on a leash held by Pedro  By saying the word  Shazam  together  the six children possess the collective ability to turn into Captain Thunder  this timeline s version of Captain Marvel  who has a scarred face which he claims is due to Wonder Woman  who in this timeline is a villain  The transformation also affects Tawney  45  The children are approached by a group of superheroes   Cyborg  the Flash  Batman  Enchantress and Element Woman   seeking their help  Billy is swayed to the heroes  cause after he uses his abilities to see what the timeline is supposed to be like while stabilising the Flash s memories   which are changing to incorporate the new timeline rather than the original history that he is trying to restore   and convinces the other children to help  They transform into Captain Thunder and join the heroes to stop the war between Aquaman s Atlantean army and Wonder Woman s Amazonian forces  Captain Thunder briefly fights Wonder Woman to a draw before being transformed back into the six children by Enchantress  who is revealed to be a traitor  Before the kids can reform Captain Thunder  Billy is stabbed by the Amazon Penthesileia killing him  46   edit  Elseworld s Finest In the alternate universe Elseworlds book Elseworld s Finest

Captain Marvel is now visibly aged  with receding white hair and glasses  and is being blackmailed by Lex Luthor into working for him or Luthor will kill the captured Mary Marvel  During an alien attack on Metropolis  Marvel is trapped underneath a collapsing building with no way out  and admits that Billy Batson   here clearly defined as a separate person from Marvel  rather than simply transforming into him   died eight years ago of unspecified health problems  with the result that  when he next speaks his word  he will cease to exist like any dream that no longer has anyone to remember it  His last words to Wonder Woman are to give everyone his best  noting that it was nice existing  before he calls down his thunder and destroys himself   edit  Kingdom Come The graphic novel Kingdom Come depicts a possible future of the DC characters  In this version  Billy Batson is now grown up  but the human hostility towards superheroes has caused him unease and he has not been Captain Marvel for several years  Instead he becomes a brainwashed servant of Lex Luthor  Luthor uses Mister Mind s offspring to keep Batson in check and bend him to his will  Nevertheless  Batson s potential as a being powerful enough to rival Superman causes many others to react in fear and unease when he mingles with them  Events finally cause him to change back into Captain Marvel and he unleashes a force that could destroy the world  When the authorities try to stop it by dropping a nuclear bomb  Captain Marvel  spurred by Superman  triggers his lightning to sacrifice himself and destroy the bomb while it is still airborne  The bomb s fallout kills a large number of heroes  but does cool the war like attitudes of the survivors  Superman uses Marvel s cape as the symbol of a new world order in which humans and superhumans will now live in harmony   edit  52 and Earth 5 In the final issue of the maxi series 52   52  May 2  2007   a new Multiverse is revealed  originally

aspects similar to the pre Crisis Earth S  including the Marvel Family characters  The Earth 5 Captain Marvel and Billy Batson appeared in the Final Crisis  Superman Beyond miniseries  assisting Superman  47  The miniseries established that these versions of Captain Marvel and Billy are two separate beings and that Billy is a reporter for WHIZ Media  rather than a radio broadcaster  The Earth

Jackson Bostwick as Captain Marvel on CBS  Shazam  Saturday morning TV series  Instead of directly following the lead of the comic  the Shazam  TV show took a more indirect approach to the character  Billy Batson Captain Marvel  accompanied by an older man known simply as Mentor  Les Tremayne   traveled in an RV motor home across the USA  interacting with people in different towns they stopped in to save the citizens or help them combat evil  The wizard Shazam was absent from this series  and Billy received his powers and counsel directly from the six  immortal elders  represented in the  Shazam  name  who were depicted via animation  Solomon  Hercules  Atlas  Zeus  Achilles  and Mercury  Shazam  starred Michael Gray as Billy Batson  with both Jackson Bostwick  season one  and John Davey  seasons two and three  as Captain Marvel  62  An adapted version of Isis  the heroine of The Secrets of Isis  was introduced into DC Comics in 2006 as Black Adam s wife in the weekly comic book

Batson voiced by Shane Haboucha  In this episode  Captain Marvel joins the Justice League  but his positive opinions about supervillain Lex Luthor s apparent reform create a heavy strain on his relationship with Superman  This tension eventually leads to an all out battle between Marvel and Superman which destroys Luthor s newest creation  Lexor City  Marvel loses to Superman  Although Marvel is eventually proven to have been right all along  he is still understandably hurt by Superman s actions  and resigns from the Justice League in disgust despite Superman s efforts to apologise  unaware that he was unwittingly a pawn in a plot by Luthor and Amanda Waller to damage Superman s image  Four years later  Captain Marvel made seven appearances in Cartoon Network s Batman  The Brave

strips In 1943  C C  Beck and writer Rod Reed prepared seven sample installments of a comic strip  Syndicates expressed no interest in it  Reed suspected the DC lawsuit was why syndicates wouldn t take on the property  for fear of ending up as parties in the ongoing litigation  65   edit  Cultural impact  edit  Captain Marvel vs  Superman in fiction Superman and Captain Marvel face off in the 1996 Kingdom Come miniseries  Art by Alex Ross  Captain Marvel s adventures have contributed a number of elements to both comic book culture and pop culture in general  The most notable of these is the regular use of Superman and Captain Marvel as adversaries in Modern Age comic book stories  The two are often portrayed as equally matched  as while Marvel does not possess Superman s vision or breath powers  the magic based nature of his own powers is a weakness for Superman  The National Comics Fawcett Comics rivalry was parodied in  Superduperman   a satirical comic book story by Harvey Kurtzman and Wally Wood in the fourth issue of Mad  April May 1953   In the parody  inspired by the Fawcett DC legal battles  66  Superduperman  endowed with muscles on muscles  does battle with Captain Marbles  a Captain Marvel caricature  Marbles  magic word is  SHAZOOM   which stands for Strength  Health  Aptitude  Zeal  Ox power of  Ox power of another  and Money  In contrast to Captain Marvel s perceived innocence and goodness  Marbles was greedy and money grubbing  and a master criminal  Superduperman defeats Marbles by tricking him into hitting himself  While publishing its Shazam  revival in the 1970s  DC Comics published a story in Superman  276  June 1974  featuring a battle between the Man of Steel and a thinly disguised version of Captain Marvel called Captain Thunder  a reference to the character s original name  He apparently battled against a monster league  67  Two years later  Justice League of America  135 137 featured a story arc which featured the heroes of Earth 1  Earth 2  and Earth S teaming together against their enemies  It was in this story that Superman and Captain Marvel first met  albeit briefly  King Kull has caused Superman to go mad using red kryptonite  meaning he and Marvel battle  but Marvel restores his mind to normal with lightning  In Shazam   30  1977   Dr  Sivana creates several steel creatures to destroy Pittsburgh s steel mills  after getting the idea from reading an issue of Action Comics  He finally creates a Superman robot made of a super steel to destroy Captain Marvel  They both hit each other at the same moment  and the Superman is destroyed  Notable later Superman Captain Marvel battles in DC Comics include All New Collectors  Edition  C 58  1978   All Star Squadron  36 37  1984   and Superman vol  2   102  1995   The Superman Captain Marvel battle depicted in Kingdom Come  4  1996  served as the climax of that miniseries  with Marvel having been brainwashed by Lex Luthor and Mister Mind to turn against the other heroes  The  Clash  episode of the DC based animated TV series Justice League Unlimited  which included Captain Marvel as a guest character  featured a Superman Captain Marvel fight as its centerpiece  By contrast  the depiction of the pair s first meeting in the Superman Shazam   First Thunder miniseries establishes them as firm friends and allies to the point of Superman volunteering to be Billy s mentor when he learns the boy s true age   edit  Captain Marvel in popular culture In pop culture  Billy Batson Captain Marvel s magic word   Shazam    became a popular exclamation from the 1940s on  often used in place of an expletive  The most notable who   user of the word  Shazam   in this form was Gomer Pyle  a character from the 1960s sitcom The Andy Griffith Show and later Gomer Pyle USMC  Foxxy Cleopatra from the 2002 film Austin Powers in Goldmember is also fond of the word  In another 2002 movie  Spider Man  Peter Parker shouts  Shazam   while trying to control his
