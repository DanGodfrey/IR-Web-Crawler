analysis of foreign communications and foreign signals intelligence  as well as protecting U S  government communications and information systems  1  which involves information security and cryptanalysis cryptography  The NSA is directed by at least a lieutenant general or vice admiral  NSA is a key component of the U S  Intelligence Community  which is headed by the Director of National Intelligence  The Central Security Service is a co located agency created to coordinate intelligence activities and co operation between NSA and other U S  military cryptanalysis agencies  The Director of the National Security Agency serves as the Commander of the United States Cyber Command and Chief of the Central Security Service  2  By law  NSA s intelligence gathering is limited to foreign communications  although domestic incidents such as the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy have occurred  Contents 1 History 2 Organizational structure 2 1 Facilities 2 1 1 NSANet 2 1 2

established within the U S  Department of Defense under the command of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  The AFSA was to direct the communications and electronic intelligence activities of the U S  military intelligence units  the Army Security Agency  the Naval Security Group  and the Air Force Security Service  However  that agency had little power and lacked a centralized coordination mechanism  The creation of NSA resulted from a December 10  1951  memo sent by Central Intelligence Agency  CIA  Director Walter Bedell Smith to James S  Lay  Executive Secretary of the National Security Council  4  The memo observed that  control over  and coordination of  the collection and processing of Communications Intelligence had proved ineffective  and recommended a survey of communications intelligence activities  The proposal was approved on December 13  1951  and the study authorized on December 28  1951  The report was completed by June 13  1952  Generally known as the  Brownell Committee Report   after committee chairman Herbert Brownell  it surveyed the history of U S  communications intelligence activities and suggested the need for a much greater degree of coordination and direction at the national level  As the change in the security agency s name indicated  the role of NSA was extended beyond the armed forces  The creation of NSA was authorized in a letter written by President Harry S  Truman in June 1952  The agency was formally established through a revision of National Security Council Intelligence Directive  NSCID  9 on October 24  1952  4  and officially came into existence on November 4  1952  President Truman s letter was itself classified and remained unknown to the public for more than a generation vague   A brief but vague reference to the NSA first appeared in the United States Government Organization Manual from 1957  which described it as  a separately organized agency within the Department of Defense under the direction  authority  and control of the Secretary of Defense       for the performance of highly specialized technical functions in support of the intelligence activities of the United States   5  National Cryptologic Memorial National Cryptologic Memorial Crews associated with NSA missions have been involved in a number of dangerous and deadly situations  The well known USS Liberty incident in 1967 and USS Pueblo incident in 1968 are a small sample of the losses endured during the Cold War  6  The National Security Agency Central Security Service Cryptologic Memorial honors and remembers the fallen personnel  both military and civilian  of these intelligence missions  It is made of black granite  and has 163 names  as of 2011  carved into it  It is located at NSA headquarters  A tradition of declassifying the stories of the fallen was begun in 2001  7   edit  Organizational structure The National Security Agency is divided into two major missions  the Signals Intelligence Directorate  SID   which produces foreign signals intelligence information  and the Information Assurance Directorate  IAD   which protects U S  information systems  8   edit  Facilities NSA headquarters in Fort Meade  Maryland Headquarters for the National Security Agency is at Fort George G  Meade  Maryland  about 15 mi  24 km  southwest of Baltimore  The NSA has its own exit off Maryland Route 295 South labeled  NSA Employees Only   The scale of the operations at the NSA is hard to determine from unclassified data  some 18 000 parking spaces are visible in photos of the site  In 2006  the Baltimore Sun reported that the NSA was at risk of electrical overload because of insufficient internal electrical infrastructure at Fort Meade to support the amount of equipment being installed  This problem was apparently recognized in the 1990s but not made a priority  and  now the agency s ability to keep its operations going is threatened   9  Its secure government communications work has involved the NSA in numerous technology areas  including the design of specialized communications hardware and software  production of dedicated semiconductors  at the Ft  Meade chip fabrication plant   and advanced cryptography research  The agency contracts with the private sector in the fields of research and equipment  In addition to its Ft  Meade headquarters  the NSA has facilities at the Texas Cryptology Center in San Antonio  Texas  at Fort Gordon  Georgia  and elsewhere  On January 6  2011 a groundbreaking ceremony was held to begin construction on the NSA s first Comprehensive National Cyber security Initiative  CNCI  Data Center  the  Utah Data Center  for short  The USD  1 5 billion data center is being built at Camp Williams  Utah  located 25 miles  40 km  miles south of Salt Lake City  The data center will help support the agency s National Cyber security Initiative  10   edit  NSANet Behind the Green Door secure communications center with SIPRNET  GWAN  NSANET  and JWICS access NSANet is the official National Security Agency intranet  11  It is a classified internal network  12  and TS SCI  13  In 2004 it was reported to have used over twenty commercial off the shelf operating systems  14  Some universities that do highly sensitive research are allowed to connect to it  15  In 1998 it  along with NIPRNET and SIPRNET  had  significant problems with poor search capabilities  unorganized data and old information   16  In 2001 it was reported on the PR Newswire that NSA bought Auto Trol s product KONFIG  NM to help  document and manage  NSANet  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18   edit  National Computer Security Center The National Computer Security Center  once part of the National Security Agency  was established in 1981 and was responsible for testing and evaluating computer equipment for use in high security and or confidential applications  NCSC was also responsible for publishing the Orange Book and Trusted Network Interpretation  Red Book  detailing trusted computing and network platform specifications  The two works are more formally known as the Trusted Computing System Evaluation Criteria and Trusted Network Interpretation  part of the Rainbow Series  however  they have largely been replaced by the Common Criteria   edit  Operations  edit  Mission Cray X MP 24  ser  no  115  supercomputer on display at the National Cryptologic Museum  NSA s eavesdropping mission includes radio broadcasting  both from various organizations and individuals  the Internet  telephone calls  and other intercepted forms of communication  Its secure communications mission includes military  diplomatic  and all other sensitive  confidential or secret government communications  It has been described as the world s largest single employer of mathematicians  19  and the owner of the single largest group of supercomputers  20  but it has tried to keep a low profile  For many years  its existence was not acknowledged by the U S  government  earning it the nickname   No Such Agency   NSA   It was also quipped that their motto is  Never Say Anything   21  According to the Washington Post    e very day  collection systems at the National Security Agency intercept and store 1 7 billion e mails  phone calls and other types of communications  The NSA sorts a fraction of those into 70 separate databases   22  Because of its listening task  NSA CSS has been heavily involved in cryptanalytic research  continuing the work of predecessor agencies which had broken many World War II codes and ciphers  see  for instance  Purple  Venona project  and JN 25   In 2004  NSA Central Security Service and the National Cyber Security Division of the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  agreed to expand NSA Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education Program  23  As part of the National Security Presidential Directive 54 Homeland Security Presidential Directive 23  NSPD 54   signed on January 8  2008 by President Bush  the NSA became the lead agency to monitor and protect all of the federal government s computer networks from cyber terrorism  1  In 2010  Robert Gates called for DHS to have a  cell  that would be able to apply the full surveillance powers of NSA for domestic cyber security  24   edit  ECHELON Main article  ECHELON NSA CSS  in combination with the equivalent agencies in the United Kingdom  Government Communications Headquarters   Canada  Communications Security Establishment   Australia  Defence Signals Directorate   and New Zealand  Government Communications Security Bureau   otherwise known as the UKUSA group  25  is widely reported to be in command of the operation of the so called ECHELON system  Its capabilities are suspected to include the ability to monitor a large proportion of the world s transmitted civilian telephone  fax and data traffic  citation needed  Technically  almost all modern telephone  internet  fax and satellite communications are exploitable due to recent advances in technology and the  open air  nature of much of the radio communications around the world  NSA s presumed collection operations have generated much criticism  possibly stemming from the assumption that NSA CSS represents an infringement of Americans  privacy  However  NSA s United States Signals Intelligence Directive 18  USSID 18  strictly prohibits the interception or collection of information about      U S  persons  entities  corporations or organizations      without explicit written legal permission from the United States Attorney General when the subject is located abroad  or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court when within U S  Borders  26  The U S  Supreme Court has ruled that intelligence agencies cannot conduct surveillance against American citizens  There are a few extreme circumstances where collecting on a U S  entity is allowed without a USSID 18 waiver  such as with civilian distress signals  or sudden emergencies such as the September 11  2001 attacks  however  the USA PATRIOT Act has significantly changed privacy legality  There have been alleged violations of USSID 18 that occurred in violation of NSA s strict charter prohibiting such acts  citation needed  In addition  alleged ECHELON related activities  including its use for motives other than its national security  including political and industrial espionage  have received criticism from countries outside the UKUSA alliance  27  28  Examples include the gear less wind turbine technology designed by the German firm Enercon 29  30  and the speech technology developed by the Belgian firm Lernout  amp  Hauspie  An article in the Baltimore Sun reported in 1995 that aerospace company Airbus lost a  6 billion contract with Saudi Arabia in 1994 after NSA reported that Airbus officials had been bribing Saudi officials to secure the contract  31  32   edit  Domestic activity NSA s mission  as set forth in Executive Order 12333  is to collect information that constitutes  foreign intelligence or counterintelligence  while not  acquiring information concerning the domestic activities of United States persons   NSA has declared that it relies on the FBI to collect information on foreign intelligence activities within the borders of the USA  while confining its own activities within the USA to the embassies and missions of foreign nations  NSA s domestic surveillance activities are limited by the requirements imposed by the Fourth Amendment to the U S  Constitution  however  these protections do not apply to non U S  persons located outside of U S  borders  so the NSA s foreign surveillance efforts are subject to far fewer limitations under U S  law  33  The specific requirements for domestic surveillance operations are contained in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978  FISA   which does not extend protection to non U S  citizens located outside of U S  territory  33  These activities  especially the publicly acknowledged domestic telephone tapping and call database programs  have prompted questions about the extent of the NSA s activities and concerns about threats to privacy and the rule of law   edit  Wiretapping programs  edit  Domestic wiretapping under Richard Nixon Further information  Church Committee In the years after President Richard Nixon resigned  there were several investigations of suspected misuse of Central Intelligence Agency  CIA  and NSA facilities  Senator Frank Church headed a Senate investigating committee  the Church Committee  which uncovered previously unknown activity  such as a CIA plot  ordered by President John F  Kennedy  to assassinate Fidel Castro  The investigation also uncovered NSA s wiretaps on targeted American citizens  After the Church Committee hearings  the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 became law  limiting circumstances under which domestic surveillance was allowed  citation needed   edit  IT projects  ThinThread  Trailblazer  Turbulence NSA created new IT systems to deal with the flood of information from new technologies like the internet and cellphones  ThinThread contained advanced data mining capabilities  It also had a  privacy mechanism   surveillance was stored encrypted  decryption required a warrant  The research done under this program may have contributed to the technology used in later systems  Thinthread was cancelled when Michael Hayden chose Trailblazer  which did not include Thinthread s privacy system  34  Trailblazer Project ramped up circa 2000  SAIC  Boeing  CSC  IBM  and Litton worked on it  Some NSA whistleblowers complained internally about major problems surrounding Trailblazer  This led to investigations by Congress and the NSA and DoD Inspectors General  The project was cancelled circa 2003 4  it was late  overbudget  and didn t do what it was supposed to do  The Baltimore Sun ran articles about this in 2006 07  The government then raided the whistleblower s houses  One of them  Thomas Drake  was charged with 18 U S C    793 e  in 2010  part of Obama s unusual use of espionage law against leakers and whistleblowers  35  36  Turbulence started circa 2005  It was developed in small  inexpensive  test  pieces rather than one grand plan like Trailblazer  It also included offensive cyber warfare capabilities  like injecting malware into remote computers  Congress criticized Turbulence in 2007 for having similar bureaucratic problems as Trailblazer  36   edit  Warrantless wiretaps under George W  Bush Main article  NSA warrantless surveillance controversy On December 16  2005  the New York Times reported that  under White House pressure and with an executive order from President George W  Bush  the National Security Agency  in an attempt to thwart terrorism  had been tapping phone calls made to persons outside the country  without obtaining warrants from the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court  a secret court created for that purpose under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  FISA   37  One such surveillance program  authorized by the U S  Signals Intelligence Directive 18 of President George Bush  was the Highlander Project undertaken for the National Security Agency by the U S  Army 513th Military Intelligence Brigade  NSA relayed telephone  including cell phone  conversations obtained from both ground  airborne  and satellite monitoring stations to various U S  Army Signal Intelligence Officers  including the 201st Military Intelligence Battalion  Conversations of citizens of the U S  were intercepted  along with those of other nations  38  Proponents of the surveillance program claim that the President has executive authority to order such action  arguing that laws such as FISA are overridden by the President s Constitutional powers  In addition  some argued that FISA was implicitly overridden by a subsequent statute  the Authorization for Use of Military Force  although the Supreme Court s ruling in Hamdan v  Rumsfeld deprecates this view  In the August 2006 case ACLU v  NSA  U S  District Court Judge Anna Diggs Taylor concluded that NSA s warrantless surveillance program was both illegal and unconstitutional  On July 6  2007 the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the decision on the grounds that the ACLU lacked standing to bring the suit  39   edit  AT amp T Internet monitoring Further information  Hepting v  AT amp T  Mark Klein  NSA warrantless surveillance controversy In May 2006  Mark Klein  a former AT amp T employee  alleged that his company had cooperated with NSA in installing hardware to monitor network communications including traffic between American citizens  40   edit  Wiretapping under Barack Obama The New York Times reported in 2009 that the NSA is intercepting communications of American citizens including a Congressman  although the Justice Department believed that the NSA had corrected its errors  41  United States Attorney General Eric Holder resumed the wiretapping according to his understanding of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008 which Congress passed in July 2008 but without explaining what had occurred  42   edit  Transaction data mining NSA is reported to use its computing capability to analyze  transactional  data that it regularly acquires from other government agencies  which gather it under their own jurisdictional authorities  As part of this effort  NSA now monitors huge volumes of records of domestic emails and Internet searches as well as bank transfers  credit card transactions and travel and telephone records  according to current and former intelligence officials interviewed by the Wall Street Journal  43   edit  Role in scientific research and development NSA has been involved in debates about public policy  both indirectly as a behind the scenes adviser to other departments  and directly during and after Vice Admiral Bobby Ray Inman s directorship  NSA was a major player in the debates of the 1990s regarding the export of cryptography  Restrictions on export were reduced but not eliminated in 1996   edit  Data Encryption Standard Main article  Data Encryption Standard NSA was embroiled in some minor controversy concerning its involvement in the creation of the Data Encryption Standard  DES   a standard and public block cipher algorithm used by the U S  government and banking community  During the development of DES by IBM in the 1970s  NSA recommended changes to some details of the design  There was suspicion that these changes had weakened the algorithm sufficiently to enable the agency to eavesdrop if required  including speculation that a critical component the so called S boxes had been altered to insert a  backdoor  and that the reduction in key length might have made it feasible for NSA to discover DES keys using massive computing power  It has since been observed that the S boxes in DES are particularly resilient against differential cryptanalysis  a technique which was not publicly discovered until the late 1980s  but which was known to the IBM DES team  The United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reviewed NSA s involvement  and concluded that while the agency had provided some assistance  it had not tampered with the design  44  45  In late 2009 NSA declassified information stating that  NSA worked closely with IBM to strengthen the algorithm against all except brute force attacks and to strengthen substitution tables  called S boxes  Conversely  NSA tried to convince IBM to reduce the length of the key from 64 to 48 bits  Ultimately they compromised on a 56 bit key   46   edit  Clipper chip Main article  Clipper chip Because of concerns that widespread use of strong cryptography would hamper government use of wiretaps  NSA proposed the concept of key escrow in 1993 and introduced the Clipper chip that would offer stronger protection than DES but would allow access to encrypted data by authorized law enforcement officials  The proposal was strongly opposed and key escrow requirements ultimately went nowhere  However  NSA s Fortezza hardware based encryption cards  created for the Clipper project  are still used within government  and NSA ultimately published the design of the SKIPJACK cipher  but not the key exchange protocol  used on the cards   edit  Advanced Encryption Standard Main article  Advanced Encryption Standard Possibly because of previous controversy  the involvement of NSA in the selection of a successor to DES  the Advanced Encryption Standard  AES   was initially limited to hardware performance testing  see AES competition   NSA has subsequently certified AES for protection of classified information  for at most two levels  e g  SECRET information in an unclassified environment  when used in NSA approved systems   edit  SHA The widely used SHA 1 and SHA 2 hash functions were designed by NSA  SHA 1 is a slight modification of the weaker SHA 0 algorithm  also designed by NSA in 1993  This small modification was suggested by NSA two years later  with no justification other than the fact that it provides additional security  An attack for SHA 0 that does not apply to the revised algorithm was indeed found between 1998 and 2005 by academic cryptographers  Because of weaknesses and key length restrictions in SHA 1  NIST deprecates its use for digital signatures  and approves only the newer SHA 2 algorithms for such applications from 2013 on  47  A new hash standard  SHA 3  is currently under development  An ongoing competition  closely resembling the successful AES process  will select the function used by the standard and is scheduled to end in 2012   edit  Dual EC DRBG random number generator Main article  Dual EC DRBG NSA promoted the inclusion of a random number generator called Dual EC DRBG in the U S  National Institute of Standards and Technology s 2007 guidelines  This led to speculation of a backdoor which would allow NSA access to data encrypted by systems using that random number generator  48   edit  Academic research NSA has invested many millions of dollars in academic research under grant code prefix MDA904  resulting in over 3 000 papers  as of 2007 10 11   NSA CSS has  at times  attempted to restrict the publication of academic research into cryptography  for example  the Khufu and Khafre block ciphers were voluntarily withheld in response to an NSA request to do so   edit  Patents NSA has the ability to file for a patent from the U S  Patent and Trademark Office under gag order  Unlike normal patents  these are not revealed to the public and do not expire  However  if the Patent Office receives an application for an identical patent from a third party  they will reveal NSA s patent and officially grant it to NSA for the full term on that date  49  One of NSA s published patents describes a method of geographically locating an individual computer site in an Internet like network  based on the latency of multiple network connections  50   edit  Criticisms The NSA received criticism early on in 1960 after two agents had defected to the Soviet Union  Investigations by the House Un American Activities Committee and a special subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee revealed severe cases of ignorance in personnel security regulations  prompting the former personnel director and the director of security to step down and leading to the adoption of stricter security practices  5  Nonetheless  security breaches reoccurred only a year later when in an issue of Izvestia of July 23  1963  a former NSA employee published several cryptologic secrets  The very same day  an NSA clerk messenger committed suicide as ongoing investigations disclosed that he had sold secret information to the Soviets on a regular basis  The reluctance of Congressional houses to look into these affairs had prompted a journalist to write  If a similar series of tragic blunders occurred in any ordinary agency of Government an aroused public would insist that those responsible be officially censured  demoted  or fired   David Kahn criticized the NSA s tactics of concealing its doings as smug and the Congress  blind faith in the agency s right doing as shortsighted  and pointed out the necessity of surveillance by the Congress to prevent abuse of power  5  The number of exemptions from legal requirements has also been criticized  When in 1964 the Congress was hearing a bill giving the director of the NSA the power to fire at will any employee  the Washington Post wrote   This is the very definition of arbitrariness  It means that an employee could be discharged and disgraced on the basis of anonymous allegations without the slightest opportunity to defend himself   Yet  the bill was accepted with overwhelming majority  5  On January 17  2006  the Center for Constitutional Rights filed a lawsuit  CCR v  Bush  against the George W  Bush Presidency  The lawsuit challenged the National Security Agency s  NSA s  surveillance of people within the U S   including the interception of CCR emails without securing a warrant first  51  52   edit  Insignia The NSA s insignia  The heraldic insignia of NSA consists of a bald eagle facing its right  grasping a key in its talons  representing NSA s clutch on security as well as the mission to protect and gain access to secrets  The eagle is set on a background of blue and its breast features a blue shield supported by 13 bands of red and white  The surrounding white circular border features  National Security Agency  around the top and  United States of America  underneath  with two five pointed silver stars between the two phrases  The current NSA insignia has been in use since 1965  when then Director  LTG Marshall S  Carter  USA  ordered the creation of a device to represent the Agency  53   edit  In fiction Main article  NSA in fiction Since the existence of the NSA has become more widely known in the past few decades  and particularly since the 1990s  the agency has regularly been portrayed in spy fiction  Many such portrayals grossly exaggerate the organization s involvement in the more sensational activities of intelligence agencies  The agency now plays a role in numerous books  films  television shows  and video games   edit  Staff Main article  Director of the
