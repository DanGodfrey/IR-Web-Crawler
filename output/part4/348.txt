Spider Man  2  May 1963  Created by Stan LeeSteve Ditko In story information Alter ego Adrian Toomes Team affiliations Sinister TwelveSinister SixLegion Accursed Abilities Heightened physical attributes and flight which derives from electromagnetic tailored body harness High intelligence Adrian Toomes was born in Staten Island  New York  He is a former electronics engineer who was once the business partner of a man named Gregory Bestman  Bestman handled the finances whilst Toomes handled the inventions  One day  after creating a flight harness  Toomes eagerly rushed into Bestman s office to share the happy news  However  Bestman was not there  and Toomes discovered that Bestman had secretly been embezzling funds and that Toomes had no legal recourse  meaning he lost his job  Enraged  Toomes wrecked the business  discovering that the harness also granted him superhuman strength  He then decided to turn to crime professionally as the Vulture  His wings are as sharp as swords and can be used as projectile weapons  They will replenish themselves so he can maintain flying abilities  The Vulture employs a special harness of his own design that allows him to fly  his flight is directed by a pair of wings worn on his arms  The harness also endows him with enhanced strength and  according to some sources  increases his lifespan  Although Toomes is advanced in age  he is a strong fighter and a remorseless killer  On one occasion  he restored his youth through biochemical means  2  though this wore off after exposure to the corpse of an elemental superhuman  3  At one point he had used a device to steal Spider Man s youth  leaving Vulture young and Spider Man elderly  but this effect wore off within hours  4  The Vulture first encountered Spider Man when he was on a robbery and burglary spree throughout New York City  Spider Man realized for the first time he could sell photos to Jameson after the Daily Bugle offered a reward for a picture of the Vulture  Spider Man was beaten in the first battle due to his occupation with the camera  he was knocked out by the Vulture and sealed in a watertank with sides too slippery to climb up  but was able to break free  The Vulture then challenged the police  saying he was going to steal diamonds  however  he escaped through the sewer  Spider Man had created a device that stopped the Vulture s harness working and activated it during an airborne fight with the Vulture  causing the two to crash onto a roof  knocking the Vulture unconscious  He was then arrested  5  The Vulture modified his harness  and attempted to rob the Daily Bugle payroll  6  He joined Doctor Octopus s first Sinister Six  and gave the message to the Daily Bugle that they had captured Betty Brant  He was the last foe to battle Spider Man before Doctor Octopus  He forced Spider Man to remove his web shooters by threatening to fly away  then squirted oil onto the roof  and tried to push Spider Man off using a wind created by his wings  but Spider Man escaped this  The Vulture was caught after Spider Man swung onto him using a lasso the Vulture had tried to use against him  He then told Spider Man where to find the lair of Doctor Octopus  and like the rest of the team was jailed by the end of the story  7  Later  believing himself to be dying in prison due to injuries in the prison workshop  Toomes revealed the location of an extra Vulture outfit on the prison grounds to his cellmate Blackie Drago  who became the second Vulture  Blackie reveals to Toomes he caused the accident for this purpose  Toomes is angry  but seems to fall unconscious within the next few minutes  Blackie knocked out a guard  dug up the wings  and escaped  8  Drago  as the Vulture  teamed with Kraven against Spider Man  9  Toomes ultimately got out of prison and defeated Drago  10  and then defeated Spider Man in battle as well  11  Some time later  Dr  Clifton Shallot mutated his body into a form resembling Toomes s  but possessing natural wings and flight capability  12  The Vulture later humiliated the racketeering mobster  Mr  Morgan  who hired the Hitman to kill Spider Man  trying to rob the Vulture of his revenge  13  The Vulture then arranged the murder of New York s top mobsters to become New York s new crime lord  and battled Spider Man  14  The Vulture later escaped prison  and battled Spider Man again  15  The Vulture later came out of retirement to claim vengeance on Gregory Bestman  his former research partner who embezzled him out of the profits  16  He then confronted the Vulturians  a group of youths who stole his designs  17  He became involved in Atlantic City casino racketeering to prepare for his own ostentatious funeral  but was thwarted by the Hobgoblin  18  He moved his gambling operations to Las Vegas  where he attacked Snake Diamond in the middle of the desert for stealing his formula for a special embalming fluid  19  He later confronted the mutants Rusty Collins and Skids in an attempt to release Nitro  20  On more than one occasion Toomes has been in league with several other Spider Man villains in order to destroy the wall crawler  The Vulture has been in every incarnation of the Sinister Six  and appeared in the Sinister Twelve  He has a strong friendship with fellow villain Electro  the two of them nearly beat Spider Man to death  volume  amp  issue needed  During one of his many periods of ill health  Toomes struck a friendship with Nathan Lubensky  a man who had become the new love of May Parker s life  Nathan was unaware of Toomes  true identity  and encouraged the injured criminal to take his chances with life and not to let handicaps drag him down  Nathan was a paraplegic   Toomes followed Nathan s advice and attempted to take over his rehab clinic as the Vulture  A battle with Spider Man led to Toomes almost killing Nathan  the shock of almost taking the life of a man who had helped to save his own distracted Toomes and led to his capture  21  The Vulture would seemingly cherish Nathan s influence  but irony would serve him a cruel blow when he was hired by the Kingpin to assassinate a high ranking casino runner  During another conflict with Spider Man as part of Doctor Octopus s new Sinister Six  the Vulture sought to use a hostage as a shield  and selected May Parker from the crowd  Little did he suspect though that Nathan was also with May  and he defiantly leapt from his wheelchair and grabbed Toomes  still not realizing who it was  Toomes flew high into the air with Nathan on his back  warning the man to get off  Nathan took one look down and realized how high they were  triggering a fatal heart attack  Toomes fled as Nathan fell  Though he was successfully caught by Spider Man  Nathan would die in May s arms  22  Toomes was later diagnosed with cancer  caused by frequent exposure to the essentials needed to power his flying apparatus  In an attempt to be forgiven for all of his previous sins  the Vulture terrorized the Parker household  pleading that May Parker forgive him for indirectly causing Nathan s death  An enraged Parker attacked Toomes  forcing The Vulture to capture him and take him back to his old lair  After escaping Toomes  Peter switched to Spider Man and brutally assaulted The Vulture  and in the ensuing battle  the Vulture s own power pack malfunctioned and exploded  setting his wings ablaze  Spider Man successfully ripped the burning pack off of Toomes  and the two crash landed in a muddy ditch  23  After being arrested  Toomes was returned to the Parker home so May  reunited with Peter  could identify him  May hoped that Toomes  death would be slow and full of suffering  The next day  she visited Toomes in prison and apologized to him for her cruel remarks  but also stated that she could not forgive him  and that any kind of redemption would be left up to him and God  24  The Vulture once stumbled across a plot by the Chameleon and the Green Goblin to drive Spider Man insane by having shapeshifting androids impersonate his late mother and father  due to Toomes  interference  the androids were destroyed  leading the wall crawler to a brief nervous breakdown  The Vulture absorbed the artificial life force from the Mary Parker android  and the effect on the Vulture was twofold  not only did he become a young man again  but he was instantly cured of the cancer that had been slowly killing him for some time  2  During this period he attempted to kill everyone who d ever known him as an old man in an attempt to get a clean slate for his life  but this plan went wrong when he targeted a Prowler impersonator  the Prowler having once thwarted his attempted takeover of his old company  Toomes was unconcerned about the fact that the current Prowler was a thief who d stolen the original s costume  and Spider Man  although Toomes nearly gutted the fake Prowler  Spider Man managed to get him to the hospital  During a later fight with Spider Man  the Vulture was  attacked  by David Kalen  a man capable of dissolving anything he touched who had turned his power on himself in his grief at the death of his brother  Toomes subsequently reverted back to his old age  presumably due to Kalen s power having negated the youth effect  3  Toomes  identity as the Vulture has been claimed by impostors on several occasions  Blackie Drago and Professor Clifton Shallot are some of them  The Vulture technology was later copied by a group of thugs called  The Vulturions   Toomes defeated these usurpers as well  Also  Toomes himself was not the first comic villain to use the name  In the 1941 comic Doll Man Quarterly  a robber named the Vulture used his pet vultures to carry bombs and commit crimes  volume  amp  issue needed  In the Identity Disc series  it was revealed that Toomes  with the help of Sandman  manipulated Marvel villains Bullseye  Deadpool  Juggernaut  and Sabretooth into laying siege to terrorist group A I M  headquarters in order to retrieve a disc containing the identities of undercover S H I E L D  operatives  including that of Toomes  daughter   volume  amp  issue needed  During a brief time working for the Owl  he failed in a mission  and had his face brutally slashed by the Black Cat  and was severely beaten as punishment  He subsequently revealed himself as a member of Norman Osborn s Sinister Twelve   though he wore a helmet  presumably to mask the wounds  25  Under the tutelage of Alyosha Kravinoff  the son of Kraven the Hunter  Toomes briefly attempted a stint at heroism  but before long he returned to the other side of the law  volume  amp  issue needed  Aside from his daughter  Toomes also has a son  whom he has dismissed  and a grandson from that son  The Vulture has come to care deeply for both his grandson and his mother  committing a series of robberies to finance a cure for his grandson s terminal illness  He once had a nephew  Malachai Toomes  and flew into a killing rage when he was murdered by a gang lord  volume  amp  issue needed  During the Civil War  he was apprehended along with the Grim Reaper and the Trapster  by Captain America and his growing Resistance  who chained him together with Grim Reaper to a pole and broke his nose  When he was found and taken into custody by S H I E L D   he complained   that lunatic broke my damn nose   After Spider Man unmasked himself  Toomes was seen in his jail cell  knitting his fingers together  As someone on the television set said they hoped it would not be any trouble for Spider Man  Toomes said   Oh I think it will be    26  After Spider Man goes rogue  Toomes is seen in a S H I E L D prison cell speaking with Agent Jamie Madrox  and commenting on Spider Man s inherent weakness  that being his unwillingness to use his powers for personal gain  S H I E L D  then returns his flying harness and encourages him to hunt down Spider Man  saying that he  is now an outlaw  same as you   volume  amp  issue needed  Later  the Vulture attacks Spider Man at a book signing  and manages to slash him with a powerful sedative  Toomes  however  falls unconscious and  sensing something is wrong  Spider Man rushes him to the hospital  volume  amp  issue needed  Toomes wakes up a few hours later  where a doctor reveals that he has suffered a stroke  and many of his muscles on the left side of his body have been paralyzed  When the doctor leaves  Spider Man sneaks in and Toomes asks him to kill him because he is weak  When Spider Man refuses to do so  he says that Spider Man is also weak  and always has been  After making remarks about Uncle Ben  Spider Man takes a pillow and begins suffocating him  He fights back  and Spidey removes the pillow  commenting that  For somebody who s begging to die  you fight for life pretty hard    27  When Alyosha Kravinoff began collecting a zoo of animal themed superhumans  Vulture was one of his captives  28  To stop Vulture from using his intellect to find a way to remove his bomb collar  Kraven broke his hands repeatedly 29  but with the help of Rhino  Vulture escapes  30  Spider Man later visits Vulture s cell to ask him about the latest person who calls himself the Vulture  Toomes says calmly that he has no connection to him  though he heard that the new Vulture was made that way by the mob and is out for revenge  He just as blandly states that while he normally hates people who steal the Vulture name  he would have no problem with him killing Spider Man  31  Following the Spider Island storyline  Vulture returns as the leader of an unnamed gang of penthouse thieves who have vulture like wings  but with a new gothic style  The members of his gang have the same name of an angel that matches with the black angel look they have  32  However  it is swiftly revealed that the gang s technology is actually controlled by the Vulture  who designed their wings so that he could shut them down with a simple signal if they tried to act against him  Having used his new magnetically sensitive webbing to catch the gang and deactivate their wings  Spider Man defeats Toomes despite his new use of his gravity manipulating technology to give himself seemingly superhuman strength  33   edit   Blackie  Drago Vulture Publication information Publisher Marvel Comics First appearance The Amazing Spider Man  48  May 1967  Created by Stan LeeJohn Romita In story information Alter ego Raniero  Blackie  Drago Partnerships Adrian Toomes Raniero  Blackie  Drago  was a prison cellmate of Toomes  who tricked Toomes by causing an accident in the prison workshop that made Toomes think he could die soon  and stole the Vulture harness and costume which was recently rebuilt  He used the suit to make money through air piracy which ended up in a three way battle against Spider Man and Kraven the Hunter   Kraven resented Drago s claims that he d recently killed Spider Man when in fact Spidey had merely collapsed due to a cold   which Spider Man won  8  After robbing a helicopter  Drago was pursued by Kraven the Hunter and ended up fighting him until Spider Man arrived  Spider Man managed to defeat them and webbed them up for the police  9  He later teamed up with Toomes when escaping from prison  but that was merely so that Toomes could prove himself the true Vulture once again  Once free  he was subsequently defeated and humiliated by Toomes whom regained the recognition he deserved  A humbled Blackie was taken away by the police  vowing  I m through   I ll never put these wings on again   10  He was seen in the same prison that Norman Osborn was incarcerated in

State University  35  He also had a Vulture wings and costume making project which he requisitioned from the State Prison Authority  When one of his courses was canceled by the university trustees  something snapped in the doctor s head  and so he underwent the final stage of the mutation himself when he donned the Vulture costume  The result was a change in himself which no amount of expertise and practice could do for the original Vulture   his face  teeth  and fingernails mutated  and for a short time  the wings became part of his body  The only one who knew his secret was his lab assistant Dr  Christine Murrow and her roommate Gloria Jenkins  36  Mary Jane Watson witnessed him killing Gloria  whom he had mistaken for Christine  and she became a target  While flying around Mary Jane s apartment  he noticed Spider Man and attacked him  Vulture managed to defeat Spider Man and leave him for dead  Clifton then searched for a way to reverse the transformation  He stole some chemicals from a ship called D sseldorf at Dock 20  The next morning as he was flying to Christine s lab  Vulture noticed Mary Jane in her car  He dove toward the car and grabbed Mary Jane  He was then encountered in the air by Spider Man who dropped Mary Jane giving Vulture enough time to reach the Biology Lab  He attacked Christine only for Spider Man to arrive and defend her  Vulture managed rip the webbing with his talons and teeth  Their fight continued with Spider Man blinding Vulture with the webbing as the cops arrived and threw a net over them  Still blinded by the webbing  Vulture broke free from the net and grabbed Spider Man thinking he was Catherine  When he saw it was Spider Man  Vulture ended up dropping him  12  Vulture went back to his lab and transformed back into

that Peter Parker had followed him and picked him up and dropped him into the water  When he flew above Mary Jane s apartment  Vulture noticed her getting into a taxi  Vulture attacked the taxi and

story arc  Spider Man 24 7   a new Vulture has appeared  He is revealed to be a mutate  This Vulture  however  is a vigilante rather than a super villain  as he mercilessly kills and eats criminals  He is found by Spider Man  who at first thinks it will be an easy battle  having beaten Adrian Toomes and those who have used his harness before  Surprised to find that this Vulture s wings are apparently real and he also has a separated beak like mandible  Spider Man is temporarily blinded by an acid the creature spits in his face  40  After escaping the battle  Spider Man questions the incarcerated Toomes on the new Vulture  who says he has no connection to him  and while he hates other Vulture name stealers he has no problem with this one killing Spider Man  Spider Man defeats the new Vulture in a battle in the new Yankee Stadium  31  During The Gauntlet storyline  he is broken out of prison by Electro under the orders of the Kravinoffs  He escapes and goes after the mobsters responsible for his transformation  The first mobster he finds reveals at least part of Vulture s past  as he was originally mob  cleaner  Jimmy Natale  and then claims that the transformation was caused by J  Jonah Jameson  Jameson claims innocence  and Spider Man also believes it to be a frame up  but finds the Vulture attacking Jameson in his office  41  Jimmy kills a security guard that saves Jameson s life and flies away  convinced that the mob had in fact turned him into a monster  He is last seen supposedly killing the mob member who tells him the truth about his origin where he was their  ace up their sleeve  when Mysterio started helping the other Maggia families  Jimmy is later seen soaring past a jobless  depressed Peter Parker into the night  42  During the  Origin of

in the skies over New York  Jimmy is apparently killed after being stabbed in the chest and head before falling to the city below  44   edit  Powers and abilities Utilizing his harness  the Vulture is able to fly as if by natural winged flight  He wears a costume of synthetic stretch fabric housing a tailored electromagnetic harness with bird like wings attached beneath the arms  This consists of an electromagnetic anti graviton generator worn on his body as a harness enabling him to fly silently with precise maneuverability  The harness also increases his resistance to injury to the point that he can survive blows from Spider Man s enhanced strength despite his age  Another by product of his exposure to the harness is that despite his age and lack of exercise  his physical strength represents the upper limit of human development  When he removes the harness some of his enhanced abilities slowly fade  although the rate at which this transpires remains unclear  some writers have suggested that his strength is permanent   The Vulture is elderly and depends on his electromagnetic harness to augment his strength  vitality  and athletic prowess as well as absorbing life force to maintain his vitality  It has recently been revealed that  due to his prolonged use of the harness  the Vulture can levitate or float his body even without the harness  although he requires his wings to maneuver while airborne  The Vulture has a new version of his flight harness that has supposedly been augmented by the Green Goblin  Though Vulture claimed that it increased his strength by five hundred percent it appeared to be a bluff to frighten the Black Cat  who proceeded to beat him half to death  The Vulture is intellectually brilliant in the fields of electronics and mechanical engineering  with a great talent for invention  He has earned a Master of Science degree in electrical engineering  The Jimmy Natale version of Vulture not only can fly  but he can also spit acid from his mouth   edit  Other versions  edit  Marvel 1602 In the Marvel 1602 reality  the group of warriors working for Otto von Doom are referred to as the Vulture Fliers and wear flight enabling armor
