the landlocked 3  geographical eastern part of the Palestinian territories located in Western Asia  To the west  north  and south  the West Bank shares borders with the state of Israel  To the east  across the Jordan River  lies the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan  The West Bank also contains a significant coastline along the western bank of the Dead Sea  Since 1967  most of the West Bank has been under Israeli military occupation and is referred to as Judea and Samaria Area by Israel  A smaller part of the West Bank is administered by the Israeli civilian authorities as part of Jerusalem District  For 400 years immediately prior to the First World War  the area now known as the West Bank was under Ottoman rule as part of the province of Syria  At the 1920 San Remo conference  the victorious Allied powers  UK  US  etc   allocated the area to the British Mandate of Palestine  Following World War II  United Nations passed the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181  II  Future Government of Palestine which aimed to establish a two state solution within Palestine  The Resolution designated the territory described as  the hill country of Samaria and Judea   including what is now known as the  West Bank   as part of the proposed Arab state  but following the 1948 Arab Israeli War this area was captured by Trans Jordan  renamed Jordan in 1949   The name  West Bank  was proposed by the Jordanian authorities to describe the area west of Jordan River  The 1949 Armistice Agreements defined its interim boundary  From 1948 until 1967  the area was under Jordanian rule  and Jordan did not officially relinquish its claim to the area until 1988  ceding its territorial claims to the PLO and eventually stripping West Bank Palestinians of Jordanian citizenship  4  5  Jordan s claim was never formally recognized by the international community  with the exception of the United Kingdom  6  7  The West Bank was occupied by Israel during the Six Day War in June  1967  With the exception of East Jerusalem and the former Israeli Jordanian no man s land  the West Bank was not annexed by Israel but remained under Israeli military control  Most of the residents are Arabs  although a large number of Israeli settlements have been built in the region since 1967  Close to 500 000 Israelis live in the West Bank settlements  annexed East Jerusalem and the former

Arabic term ad difa a al gharbiya  was coined by the Jordanians after the territory  conquered by Jordan s Arab Legion in 1948  was annexed to Transjordan  forming the new Kingdom of Jordan in 1949 50  The term was chosen to differentiate the  West bank of the River Jordan   namely the newly annexed territory  from the  East Bank  of this river  namely Transjordan citation needed   Until that point  the area was generally known 12  by the historic names of its two regions   Judea and Samaria  13  the term used by Israel today   edit  Cisjordan The neo Latin name Cisjordan or Cis Jordan  literally  on this side of the  River  Jordan   is the usual name for the territory in the Romance languages and Hungarian  The analogous Transjordan has historically been used to designate the region now comprising the state of Jordan which lies on the  other side  of the Jordan River  In English  the name Cisjordan is also occasionally used to designate the entire region between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean  particularly in the historical context of the British Mandate and earlier times  The use of Cisjordan to refer to the smaller region discussed in this article  while common in scholarly fields including archaeology  is rare in general English usage  the name West Bank is standard usage for this geo political entity in English and some of the other Germanic languages  For the low lying area immediately west of the Jordan  the name Jordan Valley is used instead  citation needed   edit  History See also  History of the Levant  History of Palestine  and Syro Palestinian

the territory entrusted to the United Kingdom by the League of Nations under the British Mandate for Palestine after World War I  The terms of the Mandate called for the creation in Palestine of a Jewish national home without prejudicing the civil and religious rights of the non Jewish population of Palestine  14 The current border of the West Bank was not a dividing line during the Mandate period  but is the armistice line between the forces of the kingdom of Jordan and those of Israel at the close of the 1948 Arab Israeli War  When the United Nations General Assembly voted in 1947 to partition Palestine into a Jewish State  an Arab State  and an internationally administered enclave of Jerusalem  a more broad region of the modern day West Bank was assigned to the Arab State  In the 1948 Arab Israeli War most of the area assigned to the Arab State was occupied by Jordanian and Iraqi forces  Jordan annexed the West Bank after the war  and the annexation was recognized by the UK  7  The idea of an independent Palestinian state was not raised by the Arab populations there at the time  due to lack of political representation  King Abdullah of Jordan was crowned King of Jerusalem and granted Palestinian Arabs in the West Bank and East Jerusalem Jordanian citizenship  15  During the 1950s  there was a significant influx of Palestinian refugees and violence together with Israeli reprisal raids across the  Green Line   citation needed  In May 1967 Egypt ordered out U N  peacekeeping troops and re militarized the Sinai peninsula  and commenced an economic blockade of Israel through the straits of Tiran at the same time  Fearing an Egyptian attack  the government of Levi Eshkol attempted to restrict any confrontation to Egypt alone  In particular it did whatever it could to avoid fighting Jordan in a two front war  However   carried along by a powerful current of Arab nationalism   on 30 May 1967 King Hussein flew to Egypt and signed a mutual defense treaty in which the two countries agreed to consider  any armed attack on either state or its forces as an attack on both   16  17  On 5 June  the Israel Defense Forces launched a pre emptive attack on Egypt 18  which began what came to be known as the Six Day War  Jordan soon began shelling targets in west Jerusalem  Netanya  and the outskirts of Tel Aviv  19  Despite this  Israel sent a message promising not to initiate any action against Jordan if it stayed out of the war  Hussein replied that it was too late   the die was cast   16  On the evening of 5 June the Israeli cabinet convened to decide what to do  Yigal Allon and Menahem Begin argued that this was an opportunity to take the Old City of Jerusalem  but Eshkol decided to defer any decision until Moshe Dayan and Yitzhak Rabin could be consulted  20 Uzi Narkis made a number of proposals for military action  including the capture of Latrun  but the cabinet turned him down  The Israeli military only commenced action after Government House was captured  which was seen as a threat to the security of Jerusalem  21  On 6 June Dayan encircled the city  but  fearing damage to holy places and having to fight in built up areas  he ordered his troops not to go in  However  upon hearing that the U N  was about to declare a ceasefire  he changed his mind  and without cabinet clearance  decided to take the city  20  After fierce fighting with Jordanian troops in and around the Jerusalem area  Israel captured the Old City on 7 June  No specific decision had been made to capture any other territories controlled by Jordan  After the Old City was captured  Dayan told his troops to dig in to hold it  When an armored brigade commander entered the West Bank on his own initiative  and stated that he could see Jericho  Dayan ordered him back  However  when intelligence reports indicated that Hussein had withdrawn his forces across the Jordan river  Dayan ordered his troops to capture the West Bank  21  Over the next two days  the IDF swiftly captured the rest of the West Bank and blew up the Abdullah and Hussein Bridges over the Jordan  thereby severing the West Bank from the East  22  According to Narkis  First  the Israeli government had no intention of capturing the West Bank  On the contrary  it was opposed to it  Second  there was not any provocation on the part of the IDF  Third  the rein was only loosened when a real threat to Jerusalem s security emerged  This is truly how things happened on 5 June  although it is difficult to believe  The end result was something that no one had planned  23  The Arab League s Khartoum conference in September declared continuing belligerency  and stated the league s principles of  no peace with Israel  no recognition of Israel  no negotiations with it   24  In November 1967  UN Security Council Resolution 242 was unanimously adopted  calling for  the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East  to be achieved by  the application of both the following principles    Withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict   see semantic dispute  and   Termination of all claims or states of belligerency  and

representative over the implementation of 242  25  The text did not refer to the PLO or to any Palestinian representative because none was recognized at that time  Until 1974  Jordan demanded the

and named after major cities  According to B tselem  while the vast majority of the Palestinian population lives in areas A and B  the vacant land available for construction in dozens of villages and towns across the West Bank is situated on the margins of the communities and defined as area C  32  An assessment by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in 2007 found that approximately 40  of the West Bank was taken up by Israeli infrastructure  The infrastructure  consisting of settlements  the barrier  military bases and closed military areas  Israeli declared nature reserves and the roads that accompany them is off limits or tightly controlled to Palestinians  33  In June 2011  the Independent Commission for Human Rights published a report whose findings included that the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were subjected in 2010 to an  almost systematic campaign  of human rights abuses by the Palestinian Authority and Hamas  as well as by Israeli authorities  with the security forces belonging to the PA and Hamas being responsible for torture  arrests and arbitrary detentions  34   edit  Geography and Climate Main article  Geography of the

East Jerusalem  was 2 345 000  35  36  However  the World Bank and American Israeli Demographic Research Group identified a 32  discrepancy between first grade enrollment statistics documented by the Palestinian Ministry of Education and Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics  PCBS   2007 projections  37  with questions also raised about the PCBS  growth assumptions for the period 1997 2003  38  Several media outlets have suggested that PCBS data inflate the 2007 census figures by 30   contradicting both the Palestinian Ministry of Education s enrollment data and actual emigration growth documented by Israeli Border Police  which in 2006 observed 25 000 Palestinian Arabs emigrating from Palestinian Authority controlled territories  39  These data sets suggest that the Palestinian Arab population of the West Bank in 2007 was approximately 1 5 million  There are over 350 000 Israeli settlers living in the West Bank  as well as around 210 000 living in Israeli annexed East Jerusalem  There are also small ethnic groups  such as the Samaritans living in and around Nablus  numbering in the hundreds  Interactions between the two societies have generally declined following the Palestinian First Intifada and Second Intifada  though an economic relationship often exists between adjacent Israeli and Palestinian Arab villages  citation needed  As of October 2007  around 23 000 Palestinians in the West Bank work in Israel every day with another 9 200 working in Israeli settlements  In addition  around 10 000 Palestinian traders from the West Bank are allowed to travel every day into Israel  40  Approximately 30  of Palestinians living in the West Bank are refugees or descendants of refugees from villages and towns located in what became Israel during the 1948 Arab Israeli War  see Palestinian exodus   754 263 in June 2008 according to UNRWA statistics  41  42  43  A 2011 EU report noted that between 200 000 and 320 000 Palestinians used to live in the Jordan Valley  most of which is in Area C  in 1967  but demolition of Palestinian homes and prevention of new buildings has seen the number drop to 56 000  44  In a similar period  the Jewish population in

Transportation and communication  edit  Roads Bedouin and his camel on the road to Jericho The West Bank has 5 147 km  3 198 mi  of roads  all of which are paved  10  In response to shootings by Palestinians  some highways  especially those leading to Israeli settlements  were completely inaccessible to cars with Palestinian license plates  while many other roads were restricted only to public transportation and to Palestinians who have special permits from Israeli authorities  49  50  51  Due to numerous shooting assaults targeting Israeli vehicles  the IDF bars Israelis from using most of the original roads in the West Bank  citation needed  At certain times  Israel maintained more than 600 checkpoints or roadblocks in the region  52  As such  movement restrictions were also placed on main roads traditionally used by Palestinians to travel between cities  and such restrictions are still blamed for poverty and economic depression in the West Bank  53  Since the beginning of 2005  there has been some amelioration of these restrictions  According to reports   Israel has made efforts to improve transport contiguity for Palestinians travelling in the West Bank  It has done this by constructing underpasses and bridges  28 of which have been constructed and 16 of which are planned  that link Palestinian areas separated from each other by Israeli settlements and bypass roads  54  and by removal of checkpoints and physical obstacles  or by not reacting to Palestinian removal or natural erosion of other obstacles   The impact  of these actions  is most felt by the easing of movement between villages and between villages and the urban centres   54  Checkpoint before entering Jericho  2005 However  some obstacles encircling major Palestinian urban hubs  particularly Nablus and Hebron  have remained  In addition  the IDF prohibits Israeli citizens from entering Palestinian controlled land  Area A   As of August 2007 update   a divided highway is currently under construction that will pass through the West Bank  The highway has a concrete wall dividing the two sides  one designated for Israeli vehicles  the other for Palestinian  The wall is designed to allow Palestinians to pass north south through Israeli held land and facilitate the building of additional Jewish settlements in the Jerusalem neighborhood  55   edit  Airports The only airport in the West Bank is the Atarot Airport near Ramallah  but it has been closed since 2001  However  the airport is located within the Israeli unilaterally expanded limits of Jerusalem  so Israel

University  a Roman Catholic institution partially funded by the Vatican  opened its doors in 1973  57  In 1975  Birzeit College  located in the town of Bir Zeit north of Ramallah  became Birzeit University after adding third  and fourth year college level programs  58  An Najah College in Nablus likewise became An Najah National University in 1977  59  Hebron University was established as College of Shari a in 1971 and became Hebron University in 1980  60  Al Quds University was founded in 1995  unifying several colleges and faculties in and around East Jerusalem  61  In 2000  the Arab American University   the only private university in the West Bank   was founded outside of Zababdeh  with the purpose of providing courses according to the American system of education  62  In 2007  the College of Judea and Samaria in the Israeli settlement Ariel upgraded itself to  Ariel University Center of Samaria   63  The name change was recognized by Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak in 2010  but so far the school does not have the same status as the accredited universities in Israel  64  Most universities in the West Bank have politically active student bodies  and elections of student council officers are normally along party affiliations  Although the establishment of the universities was initially allowed by the Israeli authorities  some were sporadically ordered closed by the Israeli Civil Administration during the 1970s and 1980s to prevent political activities and violence against the IDF  Some universities remained closed by military order for extended periods during years immediately preceding and following the first Palestinian Intifada  but have largely remained open since the signing of the Oslo Accords despite the advent of the Al Aqsa Intifada  Second Intifada  in 2000  The founding of Palestinian universities has greatly increased education levels among the population in the West Bank  According to a Birzeit University study  the percentage of Palestinians choosing local universities as opposed to foreign institutions has been steadily increasing  as of 1997  41  of Palestinians with bachelor degrees had obtained them from Palestinian institutions  65  According to UNESCO  Palestinians are one of the most highly educated groups in the Middle East  despite often difficult circumstances   66  The literacy rate among Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics  PCBS  is 94 6  for 2009  67   edit  Legal status Since 1979 the United Nations Security Council  68  the United Nations General Assembly  69  the United States  70  the EU  71  the International Court of Justice  72  and the International Committee of the Red Cross 73  refer to the West Bank as Palestinian territory occupied by Israel  General Assembly resolution 58 292  17 May 2004  affirmed that the Palestinian people have the right to sovereignty over the area  74  Supporters of the Israeli right who   have argued that since the area has never in modern times been an independent state  there is no legitimate claimant to the area other than the present occupier  Israel  This argument however is not accepted by the international community and international lawmaking bodies  virtually all of whom regard Israel s activities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as an occupation that denies the fundamental principle of self determination found in the Article One of the United Nations Charter  and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights  Further  UN Security Council Resolution 242 notes the  inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war  regardless of whether the war in which the territory was acquired was offensive or defensive  Prominent Israeli human rights organizations such as B tselem also refer to the Israeli control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip as an occupation  75 John Quigley has noted that     a state that uses force in self defense may not retain territory it takes while repelling an attack  If Israel had acted in self defense  that would not justify its retention of the Gaza Strip and West Bank  Under the UN Charter there can lawfully be no territorial gains from war  even by a state acting in self defense  The response of other states to Israel s occupation shows a virtually unanimous opinion that even if Israel s action were defensive  its retention of the West Bank and Gaza Strip was not   76  International law  Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention  prohibits  transfers of the population of an occupying power to occupied territories   incurring a responsibility on the part of Israel s government to not settle Israeli citizens in the West Bank  77  Some countries  including Brazil  78  El Salvador  79  and Argentina  80  recognize the State of Palestine and consider the West Bank to be territory of that state   edit  Political positions The future status of the West Bank  together with the Gaza Strip on the Mediterranean shore  has been the subject of negotiation between the Palestinians and Israelis  although the current Road Map for Peace  proposed by the  Quartet  comprising the United States  Russia  the European Union  and the United Nations  envisions an independent Palestinian state in these territories living side by side with Israel  see also proposals for a Palestinian state   However  the  Road Map  states that in the first phase  Palestinians must end all attacks on Israel  whereas Israel must dismantle outposts  Since neither condition has been met since the Road Map was  accepted   by all sides  final negotiations have not yet begun on major political differences  The Palestinian Authority believes that the West Bank ought to be a part of their sovereign nation  and that the presence of Israeli military control is a violation of their right to Palestinian Authority rule  The United Nations calls the West Bank and Gaza Strip Israeli occupied territories  The United States State Department also refers to the territories as occupied  81  82  83  Many Israelis and their supporters prefer the term disputed territories  because they claim part of the territory for themselves  and state the land has not  in 2000 years  been sovereign  Israel argues citation needed  that its presence is justified because  Israel s eastern border has never been defined by anyone  The disputed territories have not been part of any state since the time of the Ottoman Empire  According to the Camp David Accords with Egypt  the 1994 agreement with Jordan and the Oslo Accords with the PLO  the final status of the territories would be fixed only when there was a permanent agreement between Israel and the Palestinians  Palestinian public opinion opposes Israeli military and settler presence on the West Bank as a violation of their right to statehood and sovereignty  84  Israeli opinion is split into a number of views  Complete or partial withdrawal from the West Bank in hopes of peaceful coexistence in separate states  sometimes called the  land for peace  position    In a 2003 poll  76  of Israelis supported a peace agreement based on that principle   85  Maintenance of a military presence in the West Bank to reduce Palestinian terrorism by deterrence or by armed intervention  while relinquishing some degree of political control  Annexation of the West Bank while considering the Palestinian population with Palestinian Authority citizenship with Israeli residence permit as per the Elon Peace Plan  Annexation of the West Bank and assimilation of the Palestinian population to fully fledged Israeli citizens  Transfer of the East Jerusalem Palestinian population  a 2002 poll at the height of the Al Aqsa intifada found 46  of Israelis favoring Palestinian transfer of Jerusalem residents  86   edit  Annexation Greater Jerusalem  May 2006  CIA remote sensing map showing areas considered settlements  plus refugee camps  fences  walls  etc  Through the Jerusalem Law Israel effectively  though not officially  annexed the territory of East Jerusalem and its Palestinian residents have legal permanent residency status  87  88  Rejecting the Jerusalem Law  the UN Security Council passed UN Security Council Resolution 478  declaring that the law was  null and void   Although permanent residents are permitted  if they wish  to receive Israeli citizenship if they meet certain conditions including swearing allegiance to the State and renouncing any other citizenship  most Palestinians did not apply for Israeli citizenship for political reasons  89  There are various possible reasons as to why the West Bank had not been annexed 90  to Israel after its capture in 1967  The government of Israel has not formally confirmed an official reason  however  historians and analysts have established a variety of such  most of them demographic  Among those most commonly cited have been  Reluctance to award its citizenship to an overwhelming number of a potentially hostile population whose allies were sworn to the destruction of Israel  91  92  To ultimately exchange land for peace with neighbouring states 91  92  Fear that the population of ethnic Arabs  including Israeli citizens of Palestinian ethnicity  would outnumber the Jewish Israelis west of the Jordan River  90  91  The disputed legality of annexation under the Fourth Geneva Convention 93  The importance of demographic concerns to some significant figures in Israel s leadership was illustrated when Avraham Burg  a former Knesset Speaker and former chair of the Jewish Agency for Israel  wrote in The Guardian in September 2003   Between the Jordan and the Mediterranean there is no longer a clear Jewish majority  And so  fellow citizens  it is not possible to keep the whole thing without paying a price  We cannot keep a Palestinian majority under an Israeli boot and at the same time think ourselves the only democracy in the Middle East  There cannot be democracy without equal rights for all who live here  Arab as well as Jew  We cannot keep the territories and preserve a Jewish majority in the world s only Jewish state   not by means that are humane and moral and Jewish   94   edit  Settlements and international law Main article  International law and Israeli settlements Map of Israeli settlements on the West Bank  January 2006 As of December 2010  327 750 Israelis live in the 121 settlements in the West Bank officially recognised by the Israeli government  192 000 Israelis live in settlements in East Jerusalem 11  The international consensus  including the United Nations  is that Israeli settlements on the West Bank beyond the Green Line border are illegal under international law  95  96  97  98     The European Union 99  and the Arab League citation needed  consider the settlements to be illegal  However individuals 100  including Julius Stone  101  102  have argued that the settlements are legal under international law  on a number of different grounds  The Independent reported in March 2006 that immediately after the 1967 war Theodor Meron  legal counsel of Israel s Foreign Ministry advised Israeli ministers in a  top secret  memo that any policy of building settlements across occupied territories violated international law and would  contravene the explicit provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention   103  104  A contrasting opinion was held by Eugene Rostow  a former Dean of the Yale Law School and undersecretary of state for political affairs in the administration of U S  President Lyndon Johnson and a drafter of UN Resolution 242  Some pro settler activists argue that the settlements are legitimised by the former British Mandate  According to this argument that mandate  recognized the right of the Jewish people to  close settlement  in the whole of the Mandated territory  It was provided that local conditions might require Great Britain to  postpone  or  withhold  Jewish settlement in what is now Jordan  This was done in 1922  But the Jewish right of settlement in Palestine west of the Jordan river  that is  in Israel  the West Bank  Jerusalem  and the Gaza Strip  was made unassailable  That right has never been terminated and cannot be terminated except by a recognized peace between Israel and its neighbors  And perhaps not even then  in view of Article 80 of the U N  Charter   the Palestine article   which provides that  nothing in the Charter shall be construed     to alter in any manner the rights whatsoever of any states or any peoples or the terms of existing international instruments      105  Israel also recognizes that some small settlements are  illegal  in the sense of being in violation of Israeli law  106  107  In 2005 the United States ambassador to Israel  Daniel C  Kurtzer  expressed U S  support  for the retention by Israel of major Israeli population centres  in the West Bank  as an outcome of negotiations   108  reflecting President Bush s statement a year earlier that a permanent peace treaty would have to reflect  demographic realities  on the West Bank  109  The UN Security Council has issued several non binding resolutions addressing the issue of the settlements  Typical of these is UN Security Council resolution 446 which states  the  practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967 have no legal validity  and it calls on Israel as the occupying Power  to abide scrupulously by the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention  110  The Conference of High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention held in Geneva on 5 December 2001 called upon  the Occupying Power to fully and effectively respect the Fourth Geneva Convention in the Occupied Palestinian Territory  including East Jerusalem  and to refrain from perpetrating any violation of the Convention   The High Contracting Parties reaffirmed  the illegality of the settlements in the said territories and of the extension thereof   111  On 30 December 2007  Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert issued an order requiring approval by both the Israeli Prime Minister and Israeli Defense Minister of all settlement activities  including planning  in the West Bank  112   edit  West Bank barrier West Bank Barrier  Separating Wall  The Israeli West Bank barrier is a physical barrier ordered for construction by the Israeli Government  consisting of a network of fences with vehicle barrier trenches surrounded by an on average 60 metres  197 ft  wide exclusion area  90   and up to 8 metres  26 ft  high concrete walls  10    although in most areas the wall is not nearly that high   113  It is located mainly within the West Bank  partly along the 1949 Armistice line  or  Green Line  between the West Bank and Israel  As of April 2006 the length of the barrier as approved by the Israeli government is 703 kilometers  437 mi  long  Approximately 58 4  has been constructed  8 96  is under construction  and construction has not yet begun on 33  of the barrier  114  The space between the barrier and the green line is a closed military zone known as the Seam Zone  cutting off 8 5  of the West Bank and encompassing tens of villages and tens of thousands of Palestinians  115  116  117  The barrier generally runs along or near the 1949 Jordanian Israeli armistice Green Line  but diverges in many places to include on the Israeli side several of the highly populated areas of Jewish settlements in the West Bank such as East Jerusalem  Ariel  Gush Etzion  Immanuel  Karnei Shomron  Givat Ze ev  Oranit  and Maale Adumim  The barrier is a very controversial project  Supporters claim the barrier is a necessary tool protecting Israeli civilians from the Palestinian attacks that increased significantly during the Al Aqsa Intifada  118  119  it has helped reduce incidents of terrorism by 90  from 2002 to 2005  over a 96  reduction in terror attacks in the six years ending in 2007  120  though Israel s State Comptroller has acknowledged that most of the suicide bombers crossed into Israel through existing checkpoints  121  Its supporters claim that the onus is now on the Palestinian Authority to fight terrorism  122  Opponents claim the barrier is an illegal attempt to annex Palestinian land under the guise of security  123  violates international law  124  has the intent or effect to pre empt final status negotiations  125  and severely restricts Palestinians who live nearby  particularly their ability to travel freely within the West Bank and to access work in Israel  thereby undermining their economy  According to a 2007 World Bank report  the Israeli occupation of the West Bank has destroyed the Palestinian economy  in violation of the 2005 Agreement on Movement and Access  All major roads  with a total length of 700 km  are basically off limits to Palestinians  making it impossible to do normal business  Economic recovery would reduce Palestinian dependence on international aid by one billion dollars per year  126  Pro settler opponents claim that the barrier is a sly attempt to artificially create a border that excludes the settlers  creating facts on the ground that justify the mass dismantlement of hundreds of settlements and the displacement of over 100 000 Jews from the land they claim as their biblical homeland  citation needed   edit  See also Economy of the Palestinian territories Geography of the West Bank Political status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip Rule of

everything in its power to confine the confrontation to the Egyptian front  Eshkol and his colleagues took into account the possibility of some fighting on the Syrian front  But they wanted to avoid having a clash with Jordan and the inevitable complications of having to deal with the predominantly Non Jewish Arab population of the West Bank  The fighting on the eastern front was initiated by Jordan  not by Israel  King Hussein got carried along by a powerful current of Arab nationalism  On 30 May he flew to Cairo and signed a defense pact with Nasser  On 5 June  Jordan started shelling the Israeli side in Jerusalem  This could have been interpreted either as a salvo to uphold Jordanian honor or as a declaration of war  Eshkol decided to give King Hussein the benefit of the doubt  Through General Odd Bull  the Norwegian commander of UNTSO  he sent the following message the morning of 5 June   We shall not initiate any action whatsoever against Jordan  However  should Jordan open hostilities  we shall react with all our might  and the king will have to bear the full responsibility of the consequences   King Hussein told General Bull that it was too late  the die was cast
