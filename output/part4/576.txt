of the Electoral College vote for the 2008 election  with each square representing one electoral vote  The Electoral College consists of the electors appointed by each state who formally elect the President and Vice President of the United States  Since 1964  there have been 538 electors in each presidential election  1 Article II  Section 1  Clause 2 of the Constitution specifies how many electors each state is entitled to have and that each state s legislature decides how its electors are to be chosen  U S  territories are not represented in the Electoral College  The Electoral College is an example of an indirect election  as opposed to a direct election by United States citizens  such as for members of the United States House of Representatives   The voters of each state  and the District of Columbia  vote for electors to be the authorized constitutional participants in a presidential election  In early U S  history  some state laws delegated the choice of electors to the state legislature  Electors are free to vote for anyone eligible to be President  but in practice pledge to vote for specific candidates and voters cast ballots for favored presidential and vice presidential candidates by voting for correspondingly pledged electors  2  3  The Twelfth Amendment provides for each elector to cast one vote for President and one vote for Vice President  It also specifies how a President and Vice President are elected  The Twenty third Amendment specifies how many electors the District of Columbia is entitled to have  The Electoral College s existence is controversial  A 2001 Gallup article noted that  a majority of Americans have continually expressed support for the notion of an official amendment of the U S  Constitution that would allow for direct election of the president  since one of the first ever public polls on the matter in 1944  and Gallup found no significant change in 2004  4  5  Critics argue that the Electoral College is archaic  inherently undemocratic and gives certain swing states disproportionate influence in selecting the President and Vice President  Proponents argue that the Electoral College is an important  distinguishing feature of federalism in the United States and that it protects the rights of smaller states  Numerous constitutional amendments have been introduced in the Congress seeking to alter the Electoral College or replace it with a direct popular vote  however  no proposal has ever passed the Congress  Contents 1 Background 1 1 Origin of name 1 2 Original plan 1 3 Breakdown and revision

basis for discussions  as the Virginia delegation had proposed it first  The Virginia Plan called for the Congress to elect the President  6  Delegates from a majority of states agreed to this mode of election  7  However  the Committee of Eleven  formed to work out various details including the mode of election of the President  recommended instead that the election be by a group of people apportioned among the states in the same numbers as their representatives in Congress  the formula for which had been resolved in lengthy debates resulting in the Connecticut Compromise and Three fifths compromise   but chosen by each state  in such manner as its Legislature may direct   Committee member Gouverneur Morris explained the reasons for the change  among others  there were fears of  intrigue  if the President was chosen by a small group of men who met together regularly  as well as concerns for the independence of the President if he was elected by the Congress  8  Some delegates  including James Wilson and James Madison  preferred popular election of the executive  Madison acknowledged that while a popular vote would be ideal  it would be difficult to get consensus on the proposal given the prevalence of slavery in the South  9   There was one difficulty however of a serious nature attending an immediate choice by the people  The right of suffrage was much more diffusive in the Northern than the Southern States  and the latter could have no influence in the election on the score of Negroes  The substitution of electors obviated this difficulty and seemed on the whole to be liable to the fewest objections   The Convention approved the Committee s Electoral College proposal  with minor modifications  on September 6  1787  10  Delegates from the small states generally favored the Electoral College out of concern that the large states would otherwise control presidential elections  11   edit  Origin of name Although the United States Constitution refers to  Electors  and  electors   the name  Electoral College    or any other name   is never used to describe the electors collectively  It was not until the early 19th century that the name  Electoral College  came into general usage as the collective designation for the electors selected to cast votes for President and Vice President  It was first written into federal law in 1845 and today the term appears in 3 U S C    4  in the section heading and in the text as  college of electors   12   edit  Original plan Article II  Section 1  Clause 2 of the Constitution states  Each State shall appoint  in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct  a Number of Electors  equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress  but no Senator or Representative  or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States  shall be appointed an Elector  Article II  Section 1  Clause 4 of the Constitution states  The Congress may determine the Time of choosing the Electors  and the Day on which they shall give their Votes  which Day shall be the same throughout the United States  Article II  Section 1  Clause 3 of the Constitution provided for the original fashion by which the President and Vice President were to be chosen by the electors  In the original system  the candidate who received both the most votes and more than half of all votes cast would become President  the candidate receiving the second most votes would become Vice President  The design of the Electoral College was based upon several assumptions and anticipations of the Framers of the Constitution  13  Each state would employ the district system of allocating electors  Each presidential elector would exercise independent judgment when voting  Candidates would not pair together on the same ticket with assumed placements toward each office of President and Vice President  The system as designed would rarely produce a winner  thus sending the election to Congress  On these facts  some scholars have described the Electoral College as being intended to nominate candidates from which the Congress would then select a President and Vice President  14  Each state government is free to have its own plan for selecting its electors  Several different methods are described at length below   edit  Breakdown and revision The emergence of political parties and nationally coordinated election campaigns soon complicated matters in the elections of 1796 and 1800  In 1796  Federalist Party candidate John Adams won the presidential election  by finishing in second place  Democratic Republican Party candidate Thomas Jefferson  the Federalists  opponent  became the Vice President  This resulted in the President and Vice President not being of the same political party  In 1800  the Democratic Republican Party again nominated Jefferson for President  and also nominated Aaron Burr for Vice President  After the election  Jefferson and Burr both obtained a majority of electoral votes  but tied one another with 73 votes each  Since ballots did not distinguish between votes for President and votes for Vice President  every ballot cast for Burr technically counted as a vote for him to become President  despite Jefferson clearly being his party s first choice  Lacking a clear winner by constitutional standards  the election had to be decided by the House of Representatives pursuant to the Constitution s contingency election provision  Having already lost the presidential contest  Federalist Party Representatives in the lame duck House session seized upon the opportunity to embarrass their opposition and attempted to elect Burr over Jefferson  The House deadlocked for 35 ballots as neither candidate received the necessary majority vote of the state delegations in the House  the votes of nine states were needed for an election   Jefferson achieved electoral victory on the 36th ballot  but only after Federalist Party leader Alexander Hamilton who disfavored Burr s personal character more than Jefferson s policies had made known his preference for Jefferson  Responding to the problems from those elections  the Congress proposed the Twelfth Amendment in 1803 prescribing electors cast separate ballots for President and Vice President to replace the system outlined in Article II  Section 1  Clause 3  By June 1804  the states had ratified the amendment in time for the 1804 election   edit  Fourteenth Amendment Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment allows for a state s representation in the House of Representatives to be reduced to the extent that state unconstitutionally denies people the right to vote  On May 8  1866  during a debate on the Fourteenth Amendment  Thaddeus Stevens  the leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives  delivered a very important speech on the amendment s intent  Regarding Section 2  he said  15  The second section I consider the most important in the article  It fixes the basis of representation in Congress  If any State shall exclude any of her adult male citizens from the elective franchise  or abridge that right  she shall forfeit her right to representation in the same proportion  The effect of this provision will be either to compel the States to grant universal suffrage or so shear them of their power as to keep them forever in a hopeless minority in the national Government  both legislative and executive   16  Federal law  2 U S C    6  imposes a de jure mandate for the reduction of a state s representatives to Congress  and thus its Electoral College membership  should the right to vote at any election  named in the amendment to the Constitution  article 14  section 2  be denied or abridged   edit  The Bayh Celler Amendment The closest the country has ever come to abolishing the Electoral College occurred during the 91st Congress  17 The presidential election of 1968 ended with Richard Nixon receiving 301 electoral votes to Hubert Humphrey s 191  Yet  Nixon had only received 511 944 more popular votes than Humphrey  equating to less than 1  of the national total  George Wallace received the remaining 46 electoral votes with only 13 5  of the popular vote  18  Representative Emanuel Celler  Chairman of the U S  House of Representatives Judiciary Committee  responded to public concerns over the disparity between the popular vote and electoral vote by introducing House Joint Resolution 681  a proposed Constitutional amendment which would have abolished the Electoral College and replaced it with a system wherein the pair of candidates who won at least 40  of the national popular vote would win the Presidency and Vice Presidency respectively  If no pair received 40  of the popular vote  a runoff election would be held in which the choice of President and Vice President would be made from the two pairs of persons who had received the highest number of votes in the first election  The word  pair  was defined as  two persons who shall have consented to the joining of their names as candidates for the offices of President and Vice President   19  On April 29  1969  the House Judiciary Committee voted favorably  28 6  to approve the proposal  20  Debate on the proposal before the full House of Representatives ended on September 11  1969 21  and was eventually passed with bipartisan support on September 18  1969  being approved by a vote of 339 to 70  22  On September 30  1969  President Richard Nixon gave his endorsement for adoption of the proposal  encouraging the Senate to pass its version of the proposal which had been sponsored as Senate Joint Resolution 1 by Senator Birch Bayh  23  In its October 8  1969 edition  the New York Times reported that 30 state legislatures were  either certain or likely to approve a constitutional amendment embodying the direct election plan if it passes its final Congressional test in the Senate   Ratification of 38 state legislatures would have been needed for adoption  The paper also reported that 6 other states had yet to state a preference  6 were leaning toward opposition and 8 were solidly opposed  24  On August 14  1970  the Senate Judiciary Committee sent its report advocating passage of the proposal to the full Senate  The Judiciary Committee had approved the proposal by a vote of 11 to 6  The six members who opposed the plan  Democratic Senators James Eastland of Mississippi  John Little McClellan of Arkansas and Sam Ervin of North Carolina along with Republican Senators Roman Hruska of Nebraska  Hiram Fong of Hawaii and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina  all argued that although the present system had potential loopholes  it had worked well throughout the years  Senator Bayh indicated that supporters of the measure were about a dozen votes shy from the 67 needed for the proposal to pass the full Senate  He called upon President Nixon to attempt to persuade undecided Republican Senators to support the proposal  25  However  Nixon  while not reneging on his previous endorsement  chose not to make any further personal appeals to back the proposal  26  Open debate on the proposal finally reached the Senate floor on Tuesday  September 8  1970  27  but was quickly faced with a filibuster  The lead objectors to the proposal were mostly Southern Senators and conservatives from small states  both Democrats and Republicans  who argued abolishing the Electoral College would reduce their states  political influence  26  On September 17  1970  a motion for cloture  which would have ended the filibuster  failed to receive the 67 votes  or two thirds of those Senators voting  necessary to pass  28  The vote was 54 to 36 in favor of the motion  26  A second motion for cloture was held on September 29  1970  this time failing 53 to 34  or five votes short of the required two thirds  Thereafter  the Senate Majority Leader  Mike Mansfield of Montana  moved to lay the proposal aside so that the Senate could attend to other business  29  However  the proposal was never considered again and died when the 91st Congress officially ended on January 3  1971   edit  Modern Electoral College mechanics The constitutional theory behind the indirect election of both the President and Vice President of the United States is that while the Congress is popularly elected by the people  30  the President and Vice President are elected to be executives of a federation of independent states  In the Federalist No  39  James Madison argued that the Constitution was designed to be a mixture of state based and population based government  The Congress would have two houses  the state based Senate and the population based House of Representatives  Meanwhile  the President would be elected by a mixture of the two modes  31  Additionally  in the Federalist No  10  James Madison argued against  an interested and overbearing majority  and the  mischiefs of faction  in an electoral system  He defined a faction as  a number of citizens whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole  who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion  or of interest  adverse to the rights of other citizens  or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community   Republican government  i e   federalism  as opposed to direct democracy   with its varied distribution of voter rights and powers  would countervail against factions  Madison further postulated in the Federalist No  10 that the greater the population and expanse of the Republic  the more difficulty factions would face in organizing due to such issues as sectionalism  32   edit  Summary Presidential electors are selected on a state by state basis  as determined by the laws of each state  Generally  with Maine and Nebraska being the exceptions   each state appoints its electors on a winner take all basis  based on the statewide popular vote on Election Day  Although ballots list the names of the presidential candidates  voters within the 50 states and Washington  D C  actually choose electors for their state when they vote for President and Vice President  These presidential electors in turn cast electoral votes for those two offices  Even though the aggregate national popular vote is calculated by state officials and media organizations  the national popular vote is not the basis for electing a President or Vice President  A candidate must receive an absolute majority of electoral votes  currently 270  to win the Presidency  If no candidate receives a majority in the election for President  or Vice President  that election is determined via a contingency procedure in the Twelfth Amendment  which is explained in detail below   edit  Apportionment of electors Further information  United States congressional apportionment Population per Elector allocated to each of the 50 states and DC  ranked by population  For instance  1 California  2 Texas  50 DC and 51 Wyoming  The size of the Electoral College is equal to the total voting membership of both Houses of Congress  435 Representatives and 100 Senators  plus the three electors allocated to Washington  D C   totaling 538 electors  Each state is allocated as many electors as it has Representatives and Senators in the United States Congress  33  34  Since the most populous states have the most seats in the House of Representatives  they also have the most electors  The six states with the most electors are California  55   Texas  38   New York  29   Florida  29   Illinois  20   and Pennsylvania  20   The seven smallest states by population Alaska  Delaware  Montana  North Dakota  South Dakota  Vermont  and Wyoming have three electors each  Each state s number of Representatives is determined every 10 years by the United States Census  thus determining the number of electoral votes for each state  Under the Twenty third Amendment  Washington  D C  is allocated as many electors as it would have if it were a state  but no more electors than the least populous state  The least populous state  Wyoming  has three electors  thus  D C  cannot have more than three electors  Even if D C  were a state  its current population would entitle it to three electors  based on its population per electoral vote  D C  has the second highest per capita Electoral College representation  after Wyoming  35   edit  Choosing electors Pursuant to Article II  Section 1  Clause 2 of the Constitution  each state s legislature determines how its electors are to be chosen  but no person holding a federal office  either elected or appointed  may become an elector  36  Under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment  any person who has sworn an oath to support the United States Constitution in order to hold either a state or federal office  and has then later rebelled against the United States  is barred from serving in the Electoral College  However  the Congress may remove this disability by a two thirds vote in each House  Candidates for elector are nominated by their state political parties in the months prior to Election Day  In some states  the electors are nominated in primaries  the same way that other candidates are nominated  Other states  such as Oklahoma  Virginia  and North Carolina nominate electors in party conventions  In Pennsylvania  the campaign committees of each candidate name their candidates for presidential elector  an attempt to discourage faithless electors   Federal law sets the Tuesday following the first Monday in November as the day for holding federal elections  37  Forty eight states  and Washington  D C   employ the winner takes all method  each awarding its electors as a single bloc  Maine and Nebraska use the  Congressional District Method   selecting one elector within each congressional district by popular vote and selecting the remaining two electors by the statewide popular vote  This method has been used in Maine since 1972 and in Nebraska since 1996  38  The current system of choosing electors is called the  short ballot   In all states  voters choose among slates of candidates for elector  only a few states list on the ballot the names of the candidates for elector  In some states  if a voter wants to write in a candidate for President  the voter is also required to write in the names of candidates for elector  39   edit  Meetings of electors Certificate for the electoral vote for Rutherford B  Hayes and William A  Wheeler for the State of Louisiana Electors chosen on Election Day meet in their respective state capitals  or in the case of Washington  D C   within the District  on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December  at which time they cast their electoral votes on separate ballots for President and Vice President  40  41  42  The Electoral College never meets as one body  Although procedures in each state vary slightly  the electors generally follow a similar series of steps  and the Congress has constitutional authority to regulate the procedures the states follow  The meeting is opened by the election certification official often each state s Secretary of State or equivalent who reads the Certificate of Ascertainment  This document sets forth who was chosen to cast the electoral votes  Those present answer to their name  and they then fill any vacancies in their number  The next step is the selection of a president or chairman of the meeting  sometimes also with a vice chairman  The electors sometimes choose a secretary  often not himself an elector  to take the minutes of the meeting  In many states  political officials give short speeches at this point in the proceedings  When the time for balloting arrives  the electors choose one or two people to act as tellers  Some states provide for the placing in nomination of a candidate to receive the electoral votes  the candidate for President of the political party of the electors   Each elector submits a written ballot with the name of a candidate for President  In New Jersey  the electors cast ballots by checking the name of the candidate on a pre printed card  in North Carolina  the electors write the name of the candidate on a blank card  The tellers count the ballots and announce the result  The next step is the casting of the vote for Vice President  which follows a similar pattern  After the voting is complete  the electors complete the Certificate of Vote  This document states the number of electoral votes cast for President and Vice President and who received those votes  The state election official usually has pre printed forms ready and the tellers usually only write down the number of votes cast for appropriate candidates  Five copies of the Certificate of Vote are completed and signed by each elector  Multiple copies of the Certificate of Vote are signed  in order to provide multiple originals in case one is lost  One copy is sent to the President of the U S  Senate  the sitting Vice President of the United States  by certified mail  A staff member of the Vice President collects the Certificates of Vote as they arrive and prepares them for the joint session of the Congress  The Certificates are arranged unopened in alphabetical order and placed in two special mahogany boxes  Alabama through Missouri  including Washington  D C   are placed in one box and Montana through Wyoming are placed in the other box   edit  Faithless electors Main article  Faithless elector A faithless elector is one who casts an electoral vote for someone other than the person pledged or does not vote for any person  24 states have laws to punish faithless electors  In 1952  the constitutionality of state pledge laws was brought before the Supreme Court in Ray v  Blair  343 U S  214  1952   The Court ruled in favor of state laws requiring electors to pledge to vote for the winning candidate  as well as removing electors who refuse to pledge  As stated in the ruling  electors are acting as a functionary of the state  not the federal government  Therefore  states have the right to govern electors  The constitutionality of state laws punishing electors for actually casting a faithless vote  rather than refusing to pledge  has never been decided by the Supreme Court  While many only punish a faithless elector after the fact  states like Michigan also specify that the faithless elector s vote be voided  43  As electoral slates are typically chosen by the political party or the party s presidential nominee  electors usually have high loyalty to the party and its candidate  a faithless elector runs a greater risk of party censure than criminal charges  Faithless electors have not changed the outcome of any presidential election to date  For example  in 2000 elector Barbara Lett Simmons of Washington  D C  chose not to vote  rather than voting for Al Gore as she had pledged to do  This was done as an act of protest against Washington  D C  s lack of congressional voting representation  44  That elector s abstention did not change who won that year s presidential election  as George W  Bush received a majority  271  of the electoral votes   edit  Joint session of Congress and the contingent election The Twelfth Amendment mandates that the Congress assemble in joint session to count the electoral votes and declare the winners of the election  45  The session is ordinarily required to take place on January 6 in the calendar year immediately following the meetings of the presidential electors  46  Since the Twentieth Amendment  the newly elected House declares the winner of the election  all elections before 1936 would have been determined by the outgoing House instead  The meeting is held at 1 00 p m  in the Chamber of the U S  House of Representatives  46  The sitting Vice President is expected to preside  but in several cases the President pro tempore of the Senate has chaired the proceedings instead  The Vice President and the Speaker of the House sit at the podium  with the Vice President in the seat of the Speaker of the House  Senate pages bring in the two mahogany boxes containing each state s certified vote and place them on tables in front of the Senators and Representatives  Each house appoints two tellers to count the vote  normally one member of each political party   Relevant portions of the Certificate of Vote are read for each state  in alphabetical order  Members of Congress can object to any state s vote count  provided that the objection is presented in writing is signed by at least one member of each house of Congress  An objection supported by at least one Senator and one Representative will be followed by the suspension of the joint session and by separate debates and votes in each House of Congress  after both Houses deliberate on the objection  the joint session is resumed  A State s certificate of vote can be rejected only if both Houses of Congress vote to accept the objection  In that case  the votes from the State in question are simply ignored  but never in history has Congress voted to reject a State s certificate of vote  Objections to the electoral vote count are rarely raised  although it did occur during the vote count in 2001 after the close 2000 presidential election between Governor George W  Bush of Texas and the Vice President of the United States  Al Gore  Vice President Gore  who as Vice President was required to preside over his own Electoral College defeat  by five electoral votes   denied the objections  all of which were raised only by several House members and would have favored his candidacy  after no Senators would agree to jointly object  Objections were again raised in the vote count of the 2004 elections  and on that occasion the document was presented by one representative and one senator  Although the joint session was suspended  the objections were quickly disposed of and rejected by both Houses of Congress  If there are no objections or all objections are overruled  the presiding officer simply includes a State s votes  as declared in the certificate of vote  in the official tally  After the certificates from all States are read and the respective votes are counted  the presiding officer simply announces the final result of the vote and  provided that the required absolute majority of votes was achieved  declares the names of the persons elected President and Vice President  This announcement concludes the joint session  and formalizes the recognition of the President elect and of the Vice President elect  The Senators then depart from the House Chamber  The final tally is printed in the journals of both Houses   edit  Contingent presidential election by House Pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment  the House of Representatives is required to go into session immediately to vote for President if no candidate for President receives a majority of the electoral votes  since 1964  270 of the 538 electoral votes   In this event  the House of Representatives is limited to choosing from among the three candidates who received the most electoral votes  Each state delegation votes en bloc   its members have a single vote collectively  and the District of Columbia does not receive a vote   A candidate must receive an absolute majority of state delegation votes  currently 26  in order for that candidate to become the President elect  Theoretically  the 26 least populous states could vote in bloc and elect the President  Additionally  delegations from at least two thirds of all the states must be present for voting to take place  The House continues balloting until it elects a President  The House of Representatives has chosen the President only twice  once under Article II  Section 1  Clause 3  in 1801  and once under the Twelfth Amendment  in 1825    edit  Contingent vice presidential election by Senate If no candidate for Vice President receives an absolute majority of electoral votes  then the Senate must go into session to elect a Vice President  The Senate is limited to choosing from only the top two candidates to have received electoral votes  one fewer than the number to which the House is limited   The Senate votes in the normal manner in this case  i e   ballots are individually cast by each Senator  not by state delegations   However  two thirds of the Senators must be present for voting to take place  Additionally  the Twelfth Amendment states that a  majority of the whole number  of Senators  currently 51 of 100  is necessary for election  47  Further  the language requiring an absolute majority of Senate votes precludes the sitting Vice President from breaking any tie which might occur  48  although this is disputed by some legal scholars  49  The only time the Senate chose the Vice President was in 1837  In that instance  the Senate adopted an alphabetical roll call and voting aloud  The rules further stated    I f a majority of the number of Senators shall vote for either the said Richard M  Johnson or Francis Granger  he shall be declared by the presiding officer of the Senate constitutionally elected Vice President of the United States      Johnson won   50   edit  Deadlocked chambers If the House of Representatives has not chosen a President elect in time for the inauguration  noon on January 20   then Section 3 of the Twentieth Amendment specifies that the Vice President elect becomes Acting President until the House should select a President  If the winner of the vice presidential election is also not known by then  then under the Presidential Succession Act of 1947  the sitting Speaker of the House would become Acting President until either the House should select a President or the Senate should select a Vice President  None of these situations has ever occurred   edit  Current electoral vote distribution See also  Electoral vote changes

Before the advent of the short ballot in the early 20th century  as described above  the most common means of electing the presidential electors was through the general ticket  The general ticket is quite similar to the current system and is often confused with it  In the general ticket  voters cast ballots for individuals running for presidential elector  while in the short ballot  voters cast ballots for an entire slate of electors   In the general ticket  the state canvass would report the number of votes cast for each candidate for elector  a complicated process in states like New York with multiple positions to fill  Both the general ticket and the short ballot are often considered at large or winner takes all voting  The short ballot was adopted by the various states at different times  it was adopted for use by North Carolina and Ohio in 1932  Alabama was still using the general ticket as late as 1960 and was one of the last states to switch to the short ballot  The question of the extent to which state constitutions may constrain the legislature s choice of a method of choosing electors has been touched on in two U S  Supreme Court cases  In McPherson v  Blacker  146 U S  1  1892   the Court cited Article II  Section 1  Clause 2 which states that a state s electors are selected  in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct  and wrote that these words  operat e  as a limitation upon the state in respect of any attempt to circumscribe the legislative power   In Bush v  Palm Beach County Canvassing Board  531 U S  70  2000   a Florida Supreme Court decision was vacated  not reversed  based on McPherson  On the other hand  three dissenting justices in Bush v  Gore  531 U S  98  2000   wrote   nothing in Article II of the Federal Constitution frees the state legislature from the constraints in the State Constitution that created it   54   edit  Appointment by state legislature An early method of choosing electors was selection by the state legislature  A majority of the states legislatively selected presidential electors in both 1792 and 1800  and half of the states did so in 1812  55  One reason most U S  history textbooks don t start reporting the national aggregate popular vote until the election of 1824 is because more than a quarter of all the states used legislative choice in all prior elections  there simply was no popular vote for President in those states  Even in 1824  when Andrew Jackson lost in spite of having pluralities of both the popular and electoral votes  a full quarter of the states  6 of 24  did not hold popular elections for President and Vice President  56  instead  those six state legislatures choose the electors that year  By 1828  only Delaware and South Carolina continued to use legislative choice  56  Delaware ended its practice the following election  1832   while South Carolina held on to legislative choice until it became the first state to secede in December 1860  56  Legislative appointment made four more appearances on the electoral stage  In 1848  Massachusetts statute awarded the state s electoral votes to the winner of the at large popular vote  but only if that candidate won an absolute majority  When the vote produced no winner between the Democratic  Free Soil  and Whig parties  the state legislature selected the electors  giving all 12 electoral votes to the Whigs  57  In 1864  Nevada  having joined the Union only a few days prior to Election Day  had no choice but to appoint  57  In 1868  the newly reconstructed state of Florida appointed its electors  having been readmitted too late to hold elections  57  Finally  in 1876  the legislature of the newly admitted state of Colorado used legislative choice due to a lack of time and money to hold an election  57  Legislative appointment was brandished as a possibility in the 2000 election  Had the recount continued  the Florida legislature was prepared to appoint the Republican slate of electors to avoid missing the federal deadline for choosing electors  58  The Constitution gives each state legislature the power to decide how its state s electors are chosen 56  and it can be easier and cheaper for a state legislature to simply appoint a slate of electors than to create a legislative framework for holding elections to determine the electors  As noted above  the two situations in which legislative choice has been used since the Civil War have both been because there was not enough time or money to prepare for an election  However  appointment by state legislature can have negative consequences  bicameral legislatures can deadlock more easily than the electorate  This is precisely what happened to New York in 1789 when the legislature failed to appoint any electors  59   edit  Electoral districts Another method used early in U S  history was to divide the state into electoral districts  By this method  voters in each district would cast their ballots for the candidate they supported and the winner in each district would receive that electoral vote  This was similar to how states are currently separated by congressional districts  However  the difference stems from the fact that every state always had two more electoral districts than congressional districts  as such  the electoral districts could not mirror the layout of the state s congressional districts  As with congressional districts  moreover  this method is vulnerable to gerrymandering  All states had discarded this method of elector selection after 1832  However  this method reappeared in Michigan for the 1892 election  57  Before the election  the Democratic Party had gained control of Michigan s state legislature and changed the method used from at large popular voting to electoral district voting in order to capture at least a portion of the state s electoral votes  at the time  Michigan tended to vote Republican   57  The plan worked  and Michigan split its vote  nine votes for Republican Benjamin Harrison and five votes for Democrat Grover Cleveland  Once the Republican party regained control of the state legislature  the method of elector selection was switched back to at large popular voting  57   edit  Proportional vote Under such a system  electors would be selected in proportion to the votes cast for their candidate or party  rather than being selected by the statewide plurality vote  60   edit  Congressional District Method Under the Congressional District Method  the electoral votes are distributed based on the popular vote winner within each of the state s congressional districts  the statewide popular vote winner receives two additional electoral votes  61  The Congressional District Method can more easily be implemented than other alternatives to the winner takes all method  State legislation is sufficient to use this method  A constitutional amendment is not needed  unlike some other Electoral College reform options  62  However  the Congressional District Method has its downsides  For instance  candidates might only spend time in certain battleground districts instead of the entire state and cases of gerrymandering could become exacerbated as political parties attempt to draw as many safe districts as they can  63   edit  Implementation Only Maine and Nebraska use the Congressional District Method for distributing their electoral votes  Maine has four electoral votes  based on its two Representatives and two Senators  Nebraska has two Senators and three Representatives  giving it five electoral votes  64  Maine began using the Congressional District Method in the election of 1972  Nebraska has used the Congressional District Method since the election of 1992  65  66  The Congressional District Method allows a state the chance to split its electoral votes between multiple candidates  Before 2008  neither Maine nor Nebraska had ever split their electoral votes  61  Nebraska split its electoral votes for the first time in 2008  giving John McCain its statewide electors and those of two congressional districts  while Barack Obama won the electoral vote of Nebraska s 2nd congressional district  67  Following the 2008 split  some Nebraska Republicans made efforts to discard the Congressional District Method and return to the winner takes all system  68  In January 2010  a bill was introduced in the Nebraska legislature to revert to a winner take all system  69  the bill died in committee in March 2011  70  Republicans also passed bills in 1995 and 1997 to eliminate the Congressional District Method in Nebraska  but those bills were vetoed by Democratic Governor Ben Nelson  68  In 2010  Republicans in Pennsylvania  who control both houses of the legislature as well as the governorship  put forward a plan to change the state s winner takes all system to a Congressional District Method system  Pennsylvania has voted for the Democratic candidate in the five previous presidential elections  so many saw this as an attempt to take away Democratic electoral votes  Barack Obama won Pennsylvania in 2008  but he only won a minority of the state s congressional districts  71  72  The plan later lost support  73   edit  Contemporary conflict over the Electoral College Arguments between proponents and opponents of the current electoral system include four separate but related topics  indirect election  disproportionate voting power by some states  the winner takes all distribution method  as chosen by 48 of the 50 states   and federalism  Arguments against the Electoral College in common discussion mostly focus on the allocation of the voting power among the states  Gary Bugh s research of congressional debates over proposed Electoral College amendments reveals that reform opponents have often appealed to a traditional version of representation  whereas reform advocates have tended to reference a more democratic view  74   edit  Criticism of the Electoral College  edit  Irrelevancy of national popular vote This graphic demonstrates how the winner of the popular vote can still lose in a hypothetical electoral college system  The elections of 1876  1888 and 2000 produced an Electoral College winner who did not receive the plurality of the nationwide popular vote  In 1824  there were six states in which electors were legislatively appointed rather than popularly elected  so the true national popular vote is uncertain  When no candidate received a majority of electoral votes in 1824  the election was decided by the House of Representatives and thus could be considered distinct from the latter three elections in which all of the states had popular selection of electors  75  Opponents of the Electoral College claim that such outcomes do not logically follow the normative concept of how a democratic system should function  Outcomes of this sort are attributable to the federal nature of the system  From such a configuration  argue supporters of the Electoral College  candidates must build a popular base that is geographically broader and more diverse in voter interests  This feature is not a logical consequence of having intermediate elections of Presidents but rather the winner takes all method of allocating each state s slate of electors  Allocation of electors in proportion to the state s popular vote could reduce this effect  Scenarios exhibiting this outcome typically result when the winning candidate has won the requisite configuration of states  and thus their votes  by small margins  but the losing candidate captured large voter margins in the remaining states  In this case  the very large margins secured by the losing candidate in the other states would aggregate to well over 50 percent of the ballots cast nationally  Claims that the Electoral College suppresses the  popular will  are therefore open to debate  A result of the present functionality of the Electoral College is that the national popular vote bears no legal or factual significance on determining the outcome of the election  Since the national popular vote is irrelevant  both voters and candidates are assumed to base their campaign strategies around the existence of the Electoral College  any close race has candidates campaigning to maximize electoral votes by capturing coveted swing states  not to maximize national popular vote totals   edit  Focus on large swing states Main article  Swing state These maps show the amount of attention given to each state by the Bush and Kerry campaigns during the final five weeks of the 2004 election  At the top  each waving hand represents a visit from a presidential or vice presidential candidate during the final five weeks  At the bottom  each dollar sign represents one million dollars spent on TV advertising by the campaigns during the same time period  Most states use a winner take all system  in which the candidate with the most votes in that state receives all of the state s electoral votes  This gives candidates an incentive to pay the most attention to states without a clear favorite  such as Pennsylvania  Ohio  and Florida  For example  California  Texas  and New York  in spite of having the largest populations  have in recent elections been considered safe for a particular party  Democratic for California and New York  Republican for Texas   and therefore candidates typically devote relatively few resources  in both time and money  to such states  It is possible to win the election by winning eleven states and disregarding the rest of the country  If one ticket were to take California  55 votes   Texas  38   New York  29   Florida  29   Illinois  20   Pennsylvania  20   Ohio  18   Michigan  16   Georgia  16   North Carolina  15   and New Jersey  14  that ticket would have 270 votes  which would be enough to win  In the close elections of 2000 and 2004  these eleven states gave 111 votes to Republican candidate George W  Bush and 160 votes to Democratic candidates Al Gore and John Kerry  In 2008  the Democratic candidate Barack Obama won nine of these eleven states  for 222 electoral votes   with Republican John McCain taking a combined 49 electoral votes from Texas and Georgia  Proponents of the Electoral College claim that adoption of the popular vote would simply shift the disproportionate focus to large cities at the expense of rural areas  76  Candidates might also be inclined to campaign hardest in their base areas to maximize turnout among core supporters  and ignore more closely divided parts of the country  Whether such developments would be good or bad is a matter of normative political theory and political interests of the voters in question   edit  Discourages turnout and participation Except in closely fought swing states  voter turnout is largely insignificant due to entrenched political party domination in most states  The Electoral College decreases the advantage a political party or campaign might gain for encouraging voters to turn out  except in those swing states  77  If the presidential election were decided by a national popular vote  in contrast  campaigns and parties would have a strong incentive to work to increase turnout everywhere  78  Individuals would similarly have a stronger incentive to persuade their friends and neighbors to turn out to vote  The differences in turnout between swing states and non swing states under the current electoral college system suggest that replacing the Electoral College with direct election by popular vote would likely increase turnout and participation significantly  77   edit  Allows states to disenfranchise citizens without penalty If a state makes it harder for its citizens to vote  whether by making voting more difficult  or by legally disfranchising some citizens  such as those convicted of felonies  from voting  and turnout in the state is reduced as a result  the Electoral College insulates the state from being penalized  In fact  legal scholars Akhil Amar and Vikram Amar point out that the original compromise of the Electoral College was largely due to this very fact  Direct national election of the President  which was proposed by a delegate from Pennsylvania  would have enabled the North to outvote the South  because  the South would get no credit for its half million slaves  none of whom  of course  would be able to vote  The electoral college system that ultimately emerged gave the South partial three fifths credit for its slaves   79  The states were thus allowed to disfranchise large numbers of citizens while maintaining the same influence in the Electoral College  Akhil and Vikram Amar note   The founders  system also encouraged the continued disfranchisement of women  In a direct national election system  any state that gave women the vote would automatically have doubled its national clout  Under the Electoral College  however  a state had no such incentive to increase the franchise  as with slaves  what mattered was how many women lived in a state  not how many were empowered   79  The Electoral College continues to insulate states from losing any influence when they disfranchise or suppress the votes of their citizens  whether through voter suppression  through making it more difficult or expensive to vote  or through actually taking away some citizens  votes by law   Even today  a state with low voter turnout gets precisely the same number of electoral votes as if it had a high turnout  By contrast  a well designed direct election system could spur states to get out the vote   79   edit  Favors less populous states  Every idea of proportion and every rule of fair representation conspire to condemn a principle  which gives to Rhode Island an equal weight in the scale of power with Massachusetts  or Connecticut  or New York  and to Delaware an equal voice in the national deliberations with Pennsylvania  or Virginia  or North Carolina  Its operation contradicts the fundamental maxim of republican government  which requires that the sense of the majority should prevail  Sophistry may reply  that sovereigns are equal  and that a majority of the votes of the States will be a majority of confederated America  But this kind of logical legerdemain will never counteract the plain suggestions of justice and common sense  It may happen that this majority of States is a small minority of the people of America  and two thirds of the people of America could not long be persuaded  upon the credit of artificial distinctions and syllogistic subtleties  to submit their interests to the management and disposal of one third   Alexander Hamilton  Federalist No  22  As a consequence of giving more per capita voting power to the less populated states  the Electoral College gives disproportionate power to those states  interests  Democrats often assert that the Electoral College system favors the Republican Party by disproportionately boosting the electoral weight of the less populous states  which have tended historically to vote Republican  In fact  on all three occasions that the electoral vote winner and popular vote winner has been different  the Republican party won the election  While this argument does apply to the 2000 election  it is debatable whether it helps to explain the 1876 and 1888 results  since in these cases the small states were more evenly divided  In one countervailing analysis  the Banzhaf power index  BPI  model based on probability theory was used to test the hypothesis that citizens of small states accrue more election power  It was found that in 1990  individual voters in California  the largest state  had 3 3 times more individual power to choose a President than voters of Montana  the largest of the minimum 3 elector states  80  Banzhaf s method has been criticized for treating votes like coin flips  and more empirically based models of voting yield results which seem to favor larger states less  81   edit  Disadvantage for third parties See also  Duverger s law In practice  the winner take all manner of allocating a state s electors generally decreases the importance of minor parties  82   edit  Arguments supporting the Electoral College  edit  Prevents an urban centric victory Proponents of the Electoral College claim the Electoral College prevents a candidate from winning the Presidency by simply winning in heavily populated urban areas  This means that candidates must make a much wider appeal than they would if they simply had to win the national popular vote  83   edit  Maintains the federal character of the nation  A common government  with powers equal to its objects  is called for by the voice  and still more loudly by the political situation  of America  A government founded on principles more consonant to the wishes of the larger States  is not likely to be obtained from the smaller States  The only option  then  for the former  lies between the proposed government and a government still more objectionable  Under this alternative  the advice of prudence must be to embrace the lesser evil  and  instead of indulging a fruitless anticipation of the possible mischiefs which may ensue  to contemplate rather the advantageous consequences which may qualify the sacrifice   James Madison  Federalist No  62  The United States of America is a federal coalition which consists of component states  Proponents of the current system argue that the collective opinion of even a small state merits attention at the federal level greater than that given to a small  though numerically equivalent  portion of a very populous state  The system also allows each state the freedom  within constitutional bounds  to design its own laws on voting and enfranchisement without an undue incentive to maximize the number of votes cast  For many years early in the nation s history  up until the Jacksonian Era  many states appointed their electors by a vote of the state legislature  and proponents argue that  in the end  the election of the President must still come down to the decisions of each state  or the federal nature of the United States will give way to a single massive  centralized government  84  In his book A More Perfect Constitution  Professor Larry Sabato elaborated on this advantage of the Electoral College  arguing to  mend it  don t end it   in part because of its usefulness in forcing candidates to pay attention to lightly populated states and reinforcing the role of the state in federalism  85   edit  Enhances status of minority groups Far from decreasing the power of minority groups by depressing voter turnout  proponents argue that  by making the votes of a given state an all or nothing affair  minority groups can provide the critical edge that allows a candidate to win  This encourages candidates to court a wide variety of such minorities and advocacy groups  84   edit  Encourages stability through the two party system Many proponents of the Electoral College see its negative effect on third parties as a good thing  They argue that the two party system has provided stability through its ability to change during times of rapid political and cultural change  They believe it protects the most powerful office in the country from control by what these proponents view as regional minorities until they can moderate their views to win broad  long term support from across the entire nation   edit  Death or legally defined disability of a presidential candidate The Constitution grants each state the right to appoint electors in a manner chosen by that state  While it is common to think of the electoral votes impersonally  as mere numbers  the Electoral College is in fact made up of real people  usually party regulars of the party whose candidate wins each state  with the capacity to adapt to unusual situations  That capacity might be particularly important if  for example  a candidate were to die or become in some other way legally disabled or disqualified to serve as President or Vice President  Advocates of the current system argue that these electors could then choose a suitable replacement  who would most likely come from the same party of the candidate who won the election  more competently than could the general voting public  Furthermore  the time period during which such a death or the onset of such a legal disability or disqualification might call for such an adaptation extends  under the Electoral College system  from before Election Day  many states cannot change ballots at a late stage  until the day the electors vote  the first Monday after the second Wednesday of December   In the election of 1872  Democratic candidate Horace Greeley did in fact die before the meeting of the Electoral College  resulting in Democratic disarray  the electors who were to have voted for Greeley split their votes across several candidates  including three votes cast for the deceased Greeley  However  President Ulysses S  Grant  the Republican incumbent  had already won an absolute majority of electors  Because it was the death of a losing candidate  there was no pressure to agree on a replacement candidate  There has never been a case of a candidate of the winning party dying  In the election of 1912  Vice President Sherman died shortly before the election  too late for any state to remove his name for its ballot  thus causing Sherman to be listed posthumously  The 8 electoral votes that Sherman would have received were cast for Nicholas Murray Butler   edit  Isolation of election problems Some supporters of the Electoral College note that it isolates the impact of any election fraud  or other such problems  to the state where it occurs  It prevents instances where a party dominant in one state may dishonestly inflate the votes for a candidate and thereby affect the election outcome  For instance  recounts occur only on a state by state basis  not nationwide  86   edit  State election systems The Electoral College allows for each state to conduct elections using whatever methods it chooses  i e  voting system  vote recording technology  without affecting other states  A national popular vote  by definition  requires all states to use plurality voting and would likely lead to national election rules and standards   edit  Neutralizes turnout disparities between states There are factors that affect the turnout around the country  Weather can vary greatly across a large nation  rain or winter storms can impact voter participation in affected states  In addition  when a state has another high profile contest  such as a hotly contested Senate  gubernatorial race or ballot proposition  turnout in that state can be affected  Because the allocation of electoral votes is independent of each state s turnout  the Electoral College neutralizes the effect of all such turnout disparities between states   edit  Maintains separation of powers The Constitution separated government into three branches that check each other to minimize threats to liberty and encourage deliberation of governmental acts  Under the original framework  only members of the House of Representatives were directly elected by the people  with members of the Senate chosen by state legislatures  the President by the Electoral College  and the judiciary by the President and the Senate   edit  National Popular Vote Interstate Compact Main article  National Popular Vote Interstate Compact This proposal calls for an interstate compact whereby individual states agree to allocate their electors to the winner of the national popular vote  The state legislatures of the joining states would then establish a direct election  thereby effectively circumventing the Electoral College  when they collectively have a majority  at least 270  of the electoral votes  The proposal is still 138 electoral votes short of going into effect  The proposal centers on Article II  Section 1  Clause 2 of the Constitution  which gives each state legislature the authority to determine how its state s electors are to be chosen  Many partial versions of this plan have emerged over the years  While each state has plenary power to determine how it chooses its electors  it is unclear whether Article I  Section 10  Clause 3 of the Constitution requires congressional consent before this compact could take effect  Eight states and the District of Columbia have joined the compact  The first was Maryland  when Governor Martin O Malley signed the bill into law on April 10  2007  87  New Jersey joined on January 13  2008  despite objections from Republicans who criticized the bill as undermining federal elections  88  Illinois passed the law on April 7  2008  89 Hawaii joined on May 1  when the legislature overrode a veto from Governor Linda Lingle  90  On April 28  2009  the State of Washington joined  when Governor Christine Gregoire signed HB 1598  91 Massachusetts joined the compact on August 4  2010  when Governor Deval Patrick signed that state s bill into law  92  Additionally  the District of Columbia  which has three electoral votes  joined the compact on December 7  2010  93 Vermont joined the compact on April 22  2011  when Governor Peter Shumlin signed that state s bill into law  94  On August 8
