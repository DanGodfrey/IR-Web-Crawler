River is the largest river in the Pacific Northwest region of North America  9  The river rises in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia  Canada  flows northwest and then south into the U S  state of Washington  then turns west to form most of the border between Washington and the state of Oregon before emptying into the Pacific Ocean  The river is 1 243 miles  2 000 km  long  and its largest tributary is the Snake River  Its drainage basin is roughly the size of France and extends into seven U S  states and a Canadian province  By volume  the Columbia is the fourth largest river in the U S   and it has the greatest flow of any North American river draining into the Pacific  The river s heavy flow and its relatively steep gradient give it tremendous potential for the generation of electricity  The 14 hydroelectric dams on the Columbia s main stem and many more on its tributaries produce more hydroelectric power than those of any other North American river  The Columbia and its tributaries have been central to the region s culture and economy for thousands of years  They have been used for transportation since ancient times  linking the many cultural groups of the region  The river system hosts many species of anadromous fish  which migrate between freshwater habitats and the saline Pacific Ocean  These fish especially the salmon species provided the core subsistence for natives  in past centuries  traders from across western North America traveled to the Columbia to trade for fish  In the late 18th century  a private American ship became the first non indigenous vessel to enter the river  it was followed by a British explorer  who navigated past the Oregon Coast Range into the Willamette Valley  In the following decades  fur trading companies used the Columbia as a key transportation route  Overland explorers entered the Willamette Valley through the scenic but treacherous Columbia River Gorge  and pioneers began to settle the valley in increasing numbers  following both routes to enter it  Steamships along the river linked communities and facilitated trade  the arrival of railroads in the late 19th century  many running along the river  supplemented these links  Since the late 19th century  public and private sectors have heavily developed the river  The development  commonly referred to as taming or harnessing of the river  has been massive and multi faceted  To aid ship and barge navigation  locks have been built along the lower Columbia and its tributaries  and dredging has opened  maintained  and enlarged shipping channels  Since the early 20th century  dams have been built across the river for the purposes of power generation  navigation  irrigation  and flood control  Today  a dam impounded reservoir lies along nearly every U S  mile of the once free flowing river  and much of the Canadian stretch has been impounded as well  Production of nuclear power has taken place at two sites along the river  Plutonium for nuclear weapons was produced for decades at the Hanford Site  which is now the most contaminated nuclear site in the U S  All these developments have had a tremendous impact on river environments  perhaps most notably through industrial pollution and barriers to fish migration  Contents 1 Course 1 1 Discharge 2 Geology 3 Indigenous peoples 4 New waves of explorers 5 Navigation 5 1 Opening the

Columbia  BC   Columbia Lake   2 690 feet  820 m  above sea level   and the adjoining Columbia Wetlands form the river s headwaters  The trench is a broad  deep  and long glacial valley between the Canadian Rockies and the Columbia Mountains in BC  For its first 200 miles  320 km   the Columbia flows northwest along the trench through Windermere Lake and the town of Invermere  a region known in BC as the Columbia Valley  then northwest to Golden and into Kinbasket Lake  Rounding the northern end of the Selkirk Mountains  the river turns sharply south through a region known as the Big Bend Country  passing through Revelstoke Lake and the Arrow Lakes  Revelstoke  the Big Bend  and the Columbia Valley combined are referred to in BC parlance as the Columbia Country  Below the Arrow Lakes  the Columbia passes the cities of Castlegar  located at the Columbia s confluence with the Kootenay River  and Trail  two major population centers of the West Kootenay region  The Pend Oreille River joins the Columbia about 2 miles  3 km  north of the U S  Canada border  10  Course of the Columbia River The Columbia enters eastern Washington flowing south and turning to the west at the Spokane River confluence  It marks the southern and eastern borders of the Colville Indian Reservation and the western border of the Spokane Indian Reservation  11  The river turns south after the Okanogan River confluence  then southeasterly near the confluence with the Wenatchee River in central Washington  This C shaped segment of the river is also known as the  Big Bend   During the Missoula Floods 10 000 to 15 000 years ago  much of the floodwater took a more direct route south  forming the ancient river bed known as the Grand Coulee  After the floods  the river found its present course  and the Grand Coulee was left dry  The construction of the Grand Coulee Dam in the mid 20th century impounded the river  forming Lake Roosevelt  from which water was pumped into the dry coulee  forming the reservoir of Banks Lake  12  The river flows past The Gorge Amphitheatre  a prominent concert venue in the Northwest  then through Priest Rapids Dam  and then through the Hanford Nuclear Reservation  Entirely within the reservation is Hanford Reach  the only U S  stretch of the river that is completely free flowing  unimpeded by dams and not a tidal estuary  The Snake River and Yakima River join the Columbia in the Tri Cities population center  The Columbia makes a sharp bend to the west at the Washington Oregon border  The river defines that border for the final 309 miles  497 km  of its journey  13  The Columbia River Gorge  facing east toward Beacon Rock The Deschutes River joins the Columbia near The Dalles  Between The Dalles and Portland  the river cuts through the Cascade Range  forming the dramatic Columbia River Gorge  No other river except for the Klamath completely breaches the Cascades the other rivers that flow through the range also originate in or very near the mountains  The headwaters and upper course of the Pit River flows through much of the Cascades  in contrast the Columbia cuts through the range nearly a thousand miles from its source in the Rocky Mountains  The gorge is known for its strong and steady winds  scenic beauty  and its role as an important transportation link  14  The river continues west  bending sharply to the north northwest near Portland and Vancouver  Washington  at the Willamette River confluence  Here the river slows considerably  dropping sediment that might otherwise form a river delta  Near Longview  Washington and the Cowlitz River confluence  the river turns west again  The Columbia empties into the Pacific Ocean just west of Astoria  Oregon  over the Columbia Bar  a shifting sandbar that makes the river s mouth one of the most hazardous stretches of water to navigate in the world  15  Because of the danger and the many shipwrecks near the mouth  it acquired a reputation as the  Graveyard of Ships   16  The Columbia drains an area of about 258 000 square miles  670 000 km2   6  Its drainage basin covers nearly all of Idaho  large portions of British Columbia  Oregon  and Washington  and small portions of Montana  Wyoming  Utah  and Nevada  the total area is similar to the size of France  Roughly 745 miles  1 200 km  of the river s length and 85 percent of its drainage basin are in the U S  17  The Columbia is the twelfth longest river and has the sixth largest drainage basin in the U S  6  In Canada  where the Columbia flows for 498 miles  801 km  and drains 39 700 square miles  103 000 km2   the river ranks 23rd in length  18  and its basin ranks 13th in size  19  The Columbia shares its name with nearby places  such as British Columbia  as well as with landforms and bodies of water   edit  Discharge With an average flow at the mouth of about 265 000 cubic feet per second  7 500 m3 s   6  the Columbia is the largest river by volume flowing into the Pacific from North America 20  and is the fourth largest by volume in the U S  6  The average flow where the river crosses the international boundary between Canada and the U S  is 99 000 cubic feet per second  2 800 m3 s  from a drainage basin of 39 700 square miles  103 000 km2   21  This amounts to about 15 percent of the entire Columbia watershed  The Columbia s highest recorded flow  measured at The Dalles  was 1 240 000 cubic feet per second  35 000 m3 s  in June 1894  before the river was dammed  22  The lowest flow recorded at The Dalles was 12 100 cubic feet per second  340 m3 s  on April 16  1968  and was caused by the initial closure of the John Day Dam  28 miles  45 km  upstream  22  The Dalles is about 190 miles  310 km  from the mouth  the river at this point drains about 237 000 square miles  610 000 km2  or about 91 percent of the total watershed  22  Flow rates on the Columbia are affected by many large upstream reservoirs  many diversions for irrigation  and  on the lower stretches  reverse flow from the tides of the Pacific Ocean  The National Weather Service issues tide forecasts for eight places along the river between Astoria and the base of Bonneville Dam  23   edit  Geology Drumheller Channels  part of the Channeled Scablands formed by the Missoula Floods See also  Geology of the Pacific Northwest and Missoula Floods When the rifting of Pangea  due to the process of plate tectonics  pushed North America away from Europe and Africa and into the Panthalassic Ocean  ancestor to the modern Pacific Ocean   the Pacific Northwest was not part of the continent  As the North American continent moved westward  the Farallon Plate subducted under its western margin  As the plate subducted  it carried along island arcs which were accreted to the North American continent  resulting in the creation of the Pacific Northwest between 150 and 90 million years ago  24  The general outline of the Columbia Basin was not complete until between 60 and 40 million years ago  but it lay under a large inland sea later subject to uplift  25  Between 40 and 20 million years ago  in the Eocene and Miocene eras  tremendous volcanic eruptions frequently modified much of the landscape traversed by the Columbia  26  The lower reaches of the ancestral river passed through a valley near where Mount Hood later arose  Carrying sediments from erosion and erupting volcanoes  it built a 2 mile  3 2 km  thick delta that underlies the foothills on the east side of the Coast Range near Vernonia in northwestern Oregon  27  Between 17 million and 6 million years ago  huge outpourings of flood basalt lava covered the Columbia River Plateau and forced the lower Columbia into its present course  28  The Cascade Range began to uplift during the early Pleistocene era  two million to 700 000 years ago   Cutting through the uplifting mountains  the Columbia River created the Columbia River Gorge  26  The river and its drainage basin experienced some of the world s greatest known catastrophic floods toward the end of the last ice age  The periodic rupturing of ice dams at Glacial Lake Missoula resulted in the Missoula Floods  with discharges 10 times the combined flow of all the rivers of the world  dozens of times over thousands of years  29  The exact number of floods is unknown  but geologists have documented at least 40  evidence suggests that they occurred between about 19 000 and 13 000 years ago  30  Panoramic view of Columbia River Gorge from Dog Mountain in Washington The floodwaters rushed across eastern Washington  creating the channeled scablands  which are a complex network of dry canyon like channels  or coulees that are often braided and sharply gouged into the basalt rock underlying the region s deep topsoil  Numerous flat topped buttes with rich soil stand high above the chaotic scablands  28  31  Constrictions at several places caused the floodwaters to pool into large temporary lakes  such as Lake Lewis  in which sediments were deposited  Water depths have been estimated at 1 250 feet  380 m  at Wallula Gap  830 feet  250 m  at Bonneville Dam  and 400 feet  120 m  over modern Portland  Oregon  32  Sediments were also deposited when the floodwaters slowed in the broad flats of the Quincy  Othello  and Pasco Basins  31  The floods  periodic inundation of the lower Columbia River Plateau deposited rich sediments  21st century farmers in the Willamette Valley  plow fields of fertile Montana soil and clays from Washington s Palouse   33  Over the last several thousand years a series of large landslides have occurred on the north side of the Columbia River Gorge  sending massive amounts of debris south from Table Mountain and Greenleaf Peak into the gorge near the present site of Bonneville Dam  The most recent and significant is known as the Bonneville Slide  which formed a massive earthen dam  filling 3 5 miles  5 6 km  of the river s length  34  35  Various studies have placed the date of the Bonneville Slide anywhere between 1060 and 1760 AD  the idea that the landslide debris present today was formed by more than one slide is relatively recent and may explain the large range of estimates  35  It has been suggested that if the later dates are accurate there may be a link with the 1700 Cascadia earthquake  35  36  The pile of debris resulting from the Bonneville Slide blocked the river until rising water finally washed away the sediment  It is not known how long it took the river to break through the barrier  estimates range from several months to several years  37  Much of the landslide s debris remained  forcing the river about 1 5 miles  2 4 km  south of its previous channel and forming the Cascade Rapids  38  In 1938  the construction of Bonneville Dam inundated the rapids as well as the remaining trees that could be used to refine the estimated date of the landslide  38  39  In 1980  the eruption of Mount St  Helens deposited large amounts of sediment in the lower Columbia  temporarily reducing the depth of the shipping channel by 26 feet  7 9 m   40   edit  Indigenous peoples Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce people Humans have inhabited the Columbia s watershed for more than 15 000 years  with a transition to a sedentary lifestyle based mainly on salmon starting about 3 500 years ago  41  In 1962  archaeologists found evidence of human activity dating back 11 230 years at the Marmes Rockshelter  near the confluence of the Palouse and Snake rivers in eastern Washington  In 1996  the skeletal remains of a 9 000 year old prehistoric man  dubbed Kennewick Man  were found near Kennewick  Washington  The discovery rekindled debate in the scientific community over the origins of human habitation in North America and sparked a protracted controversy over whether the scientific or Native American community was entitled to possess and or study the remains  42  Many different Native Americans and First Nations peoples have a historical and continuing presence on the Columbia  The Sinixt or Lakes people lived on the lower stretch of the Canadian portion  43  Portions of the upper Columbia River are also subject to land claims by the Okanagan  Secwepemc  Ktunaxa and  at one time the Blackfoot  South of the Canada U S  border  the Colville  Spokane  Coeur d Alene  Yakama  Nez Perce  Cayuse  Palus  Umatilla  Cowlitz  and the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs live along the U S  stretch  Along the upper Snake River and Salmon River  the Shoshone Bannock tribes are present  The Chinook tribe  which is not federally recognized  also live near the lower Columbia River  The river is known as Wimahl to the Chinook speaking natives of its lower reaches  44  and Nch i W na to the Sahaptin speaking peoples of its middle course in present day Washington  45  both terms essentially mean  the big river   Oral histories describe the formation and destruction of the Bridge of the Gods  a land bridge that connected the Oregon and Washington sides of the river in the Columbia River Gorge  The bridge  which aligns with geological records of the Bonneville Slide  was described in some stories as the result of a battle between gods  represented by Mount Adams and Mount Hood  in their competition for the affection of a goddess  represented by Mount St  Helens  46  Native American stories about the bridge differ in their details but agree in general that the bridge permitted increased interaction between tribes on the north and south sides of the river  47  48  Horses  originally acquired from Spanish New Mexico  spread widely via native trade networks  reaching the Shoshone of the Snake River Plain by 1700  The Nez Perce  Cayuse  and Flathead people acquired their first horses around 1730  49  50  Along with horses came aspects of the emerging plains culture  such as equestrian and horse training skills  greatly increased mobility  hunting efficiency  trade over long distances  intensified warfare  the linking of wealth and prestige to horses and war  and the rise of large and powerful tribal confederacies  The Nez Perce and Cayuse kept large herds and made annual long distance trips to the Great Plains for bison hunting  adopted the plains culture to a significant degree  and became the main conduit through which horses and the plains culture diffused into the Columbia River region  Other peoples acquired horses and aspects of the plains culture unevenly  The Yakama  Umatilla  Palus  Spokane  and Coeur d Alene maintained sizable herds of horses and adopted some of the plains cultural characteristics  but fishing and fish related economies remained important  Less affected groups included the Molala  Klickitat  Wenatchi  Okanagan  and Sinkiuse Columbia peoples  who owned small numbers of horses and adopted few plains culture features  Some groups remained essentially unaffected  such as the Sanpoil and Nespelem people  whose culture remained centered on fishing  49  Natives of the region encountered foreigners at several times and places during the 18th and 19th centuries  European and American vessels explored the coastal area around the mouth of the river in the late 18th century  trading with local natives  The contact would prove devastating to the Indian tribes  a large portion of their population was wiped out by a smallpox epidemic  Canadian explorer Alexander Mackenzie crossed what is now interior British Columbia in 1793  50  In 1805 07  the Lewis and Clark Expedition entered the Oregon Country along the Clearwater and Snake Rivers  and encountered numerous small settlements of natives  Their records recount tales of hospitable traders who were not above stealing small items from the visitors  They also noted brass teakettles  a British musket  and other artifacts that had been obtained in trade with coastal tribes  51  From the earliest contact with westerners  the natives of the mid  and lower Columbia were not tribal  but instead congregated in social units no larger than a village  and more often at a family level  these units would shift with the season as people moved about  following the salmon catch up and down the river s tributaries  52  Sparked by the 1848 Whitman Massacre  a number of violent battles were fought between American settlers and the region s natives  53  The subsequent Indian Wars  notably the Yakima War  decimated the native population and removed much land from native control  54  As years progressed  the right of natives to fish along the Columbia became the central issue of contention with the states  commercial fishers  and private property owners  The U S  Supreme Court upheld fishing rights in landmark cases in 1905 and 1918  55  Dipnet fishing at Celilo Falls  1941 Fish were central to the culture of the region s natives  both as sustenance and as part of their religious beliefs  56  Natives drew fish from the Columbia at several major sites  which also served as trading posts  Celilo Falls  located east of the modern city of The Dalles  was a vital hub for trade and the interaction of different cultural groups  52  being used for fishing and trading for 11 000 years  Prior to contact with westerners  villages along this 9 mile  14 km  stretch may have at times had a population as great as 10 000  57  The site drew traders from as far away as the Great Plains  58  The Cascades Rapids of the Columbia River Gorge  and Kettle Falls and Priest Rapids in eastern Washington  were also major fishing and trading sites  59  60  In prehistoric times the Columbia s salmon and steelhead runs numbered an estimated annual average of 10 to 16 million fish  In comparison  the largest run since 1938 was in 1986  with 3 2 million fish entering the Columbia  61  The annual catch by natives has been estimated at 42 million pounds  19 000 t   62  The most important and productive native fishing site was located at Celilo Falls  which was perhaps the most productive inland fishing site in North America  63  The falls were located at the border between Chinookan  and Sahaptian speaking peoples and served as the center of an extensive trading network across the Pacific Plateau  64  Celilo was the oldest continuously inhabited community on the North American continent  65  Salmon canneries established by white settlers beginning in 1866 had a strong negative impact on the salmon population  and in 1908 U S  President Theodore Roosevelt observed that the salmon runs were but a fraction of what they had been 25 years prior  66  As river development continued in the 20th century  each of these major fishing sites was flooded by a dam  beginning with Cascades Rapids in 1938  The development was accompanied by extensive negotiations between natives and U S  government agencies  The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs  a coalition of various tribes  adopted a constitution and incorporated after the 1938 completion of the Bonneville Dam flooded Cascades Rapids  67  Still  in the 1930s  there were natives who lived along the river and fished year round  moving along with the fish s migration patterns throughout the seasons  68  The Yakama were slower to do so  organizing a formal government in 1944  69  In the 21st century  the Yakama  Nez Perce  Umatilla  and Warm Springs tribes all have treaty fishing rights along the Columbia and its tributaries  62  In 1957 Celilo Falls was submerged by the construction of The Dalles Dam  and the native fishing community was displaced  65  The affected tribes received a  26 8 million settlement for the loss of Celilo and other fishing sites submerged by The Dalles Dam  70  The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs used part of its  4 million settlement to establish the Kah Nee Ta resort south of Mount Hood  67   edit  New waves of explorers See also  History of Oregon  History of British Columbia  History of Washington  U S  state   Oregon Country  and History of

Europeans  possibly as early as 219 B C  71  It is unknown whether they landed near the Columbia  Evidence exists that Spanish castaways reached the shore in 1679 and traded with the Clatsop  if these were indeed the first Europeans to see the Columbia  they failed to send word home to Spain  72  In the 18th century  there was strong interest in discovering a Northwest Passage that would permit navigation between the Atlantic  or inland North America  and the Pacific Ocean  Many ships in the area  especially those under Spanish and British command  searched the northwest coast for a large river that might connect to Hudson Bay or the Missouri River  The first documented European discovery of the Columbia River was that of Bruno de Heceta  who in 1775 sighted the river s mouth  On the advice of his officers  he did not explore it  as he was short staffed and the current was strong  He considered it a bay  and called it Ensenada de Asunci n  Later Spanish maps based on his discovery showed a river  labeled Rio de San Roque  44  or an entrance  called Entrada de Hezeta  72  Following Heceta s reports  British maritime fur trader Captain John Meares searched for the river in 1788 but concluded that it did not exist  73  He named Cape Disappointment for the non existent river  not realizing the cape marks the northern edge of the river s mouth  74  What happened next would form the basis for decades of both cooperation and dispute between British and American exploration of  and ownership claim to  the region  Royal Navy commander George Vancouver sailed past the mouth in April 1792 and observed a change in the water s color  but he accepted Meares  report and continued on his journey northward  44  Later that month  Vancouver encountered the American captain Robert Gray at the Strait of Juan de Fuca  Gray reported that he had seen the entrance to the Columbia and had spent nine days trying but failing to enter  75  On May 12  1792  Gray returned south and crossed the Columbia Bar  becoming the first explorer to enter the river  Gray s fur trading mission had been financed by Boston merchants  who outfitted him with a private vessel named Columbia Rediviva  he named the river after the ship on May 18  72  76  Gray spent nine days trading near the mouth of the Columbia  then left without having gone beyond 13 miles  21 km  upstream  The farthest point reached was Grays Bay at the mouth of Grays River  77  Gray s discovery of the Columbia River was later used by the United States to support its claim to the Oregon Country  which was also claimed by Russia  Great Britain  Spain and other nations  78  In October 1792  Vancouver sent Lieutenant William Robert Broughton  his second in command  up the river  Broughton got as far as the Sandy River at the western end of the Columbia River Gorge  about 100 miles  160 km  upstream  sighting and naming Mount Hood  Broughton formally claimed the river  its drainage basin  and the nearby coast for Britain  In contrast  Gray had not made any formal claims on behalf of the United States  79  80  Columbia River  Cascade Mountains  Oregon   1876  by Vincent Colyer  oil on canvas   Beacon Rock is visible on the left  Detail from the Lewis and Clark expedition map  The Willamette River is shown as the  Multnomah   while the Snake River is  Lewis s River    See complete map   Because the Columbia was at the same latitude as the headwaters of the Missouri River  there was some speculation that Gray and Vancouver had discovered the long sought Northwest Passage  A 1798 British map showed a dotted line connecting the Columbia with the Missouri  72  However  when the American explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark charted the vast  unmapped lands of the American West in their overland expedition  1803 05   they found no passage between the rivers  After crossing the Rocky Mountains  Lewis and Clark built dugout canoes and paddled down the Snake River  reaching the Columbia near the present day Tri Cities  Washington  They explored a few miles upriver  as far as Bateman Island  before heading down the Columbia  concluding their journey at the river s mouth and establishing Fort Clatsop  a short lived establishment that was occupied for less than three months  72  Canadian explorer David Thompson  of the North West Company  spent the winter of 1807 08 at Kootenae House near the source of the Columbia at present day Invermere  British Columbia  Over the next few years he explored much of the river and its northern tributaries  In 1811  he traveled down the Columbia to the Pacific Ocean  arriving at the mouth just after John Jacob Astor s Pacific Fur Company had founded Astoria  On his return to the north  Thompson explored the one remaining part of the river he had not yet seen  becoming the first European American to travel the entire length of the river  72  In 1825 the Hudson s Bay Company  HBC  established Fort Vancouver on the bank of the Columbia  in what is now Vancouver  Washington  as the headquarters of the company s Columbia District  which encompassed everything west of the Rocky Mountains  John McLoughlin  a physician  was appointed Chief Factor of the Columbia District  The HBC reoriented its Columbia District operations toward the Pacific Ocean via the Columbia  which became the region s main trunk route  81  In the early 1840s Americans began to colonize the Oregon country in large numbers via the Oregon Trail  despite the HBC s efforts to discourage American settlement in the region  For many the final leg of the journey involved travel down the lower Columbia River to Fort Vancouver  82  This part of the Oregon Trail  from The Dalles to Fort Vancouver  was the trail s most treacherous stretch  which prompted the 1846 construction of the Barlow Road  83  In the Treaty of 1818 the United States and Britain agreed that both nations were to enjoy equal rights in Oregon Country for 10 years  By 1828  when the so called  joint occupation  was renewed for an indefinite period  it seemed probable that the lower Columbia River would in time become the border  For years the Hudson s Bay Company successfully maintained control of the Columbia River and American attempts to gain a foothold were fended off  In the 1830s  however  American religious missions were established at several locations in the lower Columbia River region  And in the 1840s a mass migration of American settlers undermined British control  The Hudson s Bay Company tried to maintain dominance by shifting from the fur trade  which was in sharp decline  to exporting other goods such as salmon and lumber  Colonization schemes were attempted  but failed to match the scale of American settlement  Americans generally settled south of the Columbia  mainly in the Willamette Valley  The Hudson s Bay Company tried to establish settlements north of the river  but nearly all the British colonists moved south to the Willamette Valley  The hope that the British colonists might dilute the American flavor of the valley failed in the face of the overwhelming number of American settlers  These developments rekindled the issue of  joint occupation  and the boundary dispute  While some British interests  especially the Hudson s Bay Company  fought for a boundary along the Columbia River  the Oregon Treaty of 1846 set the boundary at the 49th parallel  The Columbia River did become the border between the U S  territories of Oregon and Washington  84  Oregon became a U S  state in 1859  Washington in 1889  By the turn of the 20th century  the difficulty of navigating the Columbia was seen as an impediment to the economic development of the Inland Empire region east of the Cascades  85  The dredging and dam

60 miles  97 km  per hour  The rapids are now submerged under the pool of the Bonneville Dam  Benson massive log raft containing an entire year s worth of logs from one timber camp heads downriver in 1906  American captain Robert Gray and British captain George Vancouver  who explored the river in 1792  proved that it was possible to cross the Columbia Bar  Many of the challenges associated with that feat remain today  even with modern engineering alterations to the mouth of the river  the strong currents and shifting sandbar make it dangerous to pass between the river and the Pacific Ocean  86  The use of steamboats along the river  beginning with the British Beaver in 1836 87  and followed by American vessels in 1850  88  contributed to the rapid settlement and economic development of the region  89  90  Steamboats operated in several distinct stretches of the river  on its lower reaches  from the Pacific Ocean to Cascades Rapids  from the Cascades to Celilo Falls  from Celilo to the confluence with the Snake River  on the Wenatchee Reach of eastern Washington  on British Columbia s Arrow Lakes  and on tributaries like the Willamette  the Snake and Kootenay Lake  The boats  initially powered by burning wood  carried passengers and freight throughout the region for many years  Early railroads served to connect steamboat lines interrupted by waterfalls on the river s lower reaches  91  In the 1880s  railroads maintained by companies such as the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company and the Shaver Transportation Company began to supplement steamboat operations as the major transportation links along the river  91   edit  Opening the passage to Lewiston As early as 1881  industrialists proposed altering the natural channel of the Columbia to improve navigation  88  Changes to the river over the years have included the construction of jetties at the river s mouth  dredging  and the construction of canals and navigation locks  Today  ocean freighters can travel upriver as far as Portland and Vancouver  and barges can reach as far inland as Lewiston  Idaho  17  The shifting Columbia Bar makes passage between the river and the Pacific Ocean difficult and dangerous  and numerous rapids along the river hinder navigation  Jetties  first constructed in 1886  88  extend the river s channel into the ocean  Strong currents and the shifting sandbar remain a threat to ships entering the river and necessitate continuous maintenance of the jetties  In 1891 the Columbia was dredged to enhance shipping  The channel between the ocean and Portland and Vancouver was deepened from 17 feet  5 2 m  to 25 feet  7 6 m   The Columbian called for the channel to be deepened to 40 feet  12 m  as early as 1905  but that depth was not attained until 1976  92  Cascade Locks and Canal were first constructed in 1896 around the Cascades Rapids  93  enabling boats to travel safely through the Columbia River Gorge  94  The Celilo Canal  bypassing Celilo Falls  opened to river traffic in 1915  95  In the mid 20th century  the construction of dams along the length of the river submerged the rapids beneath a series of reservoirs  An extensive system of locks allowed ships and barges to pass easily from one reservoir to the next  A navigation channel reaching to Lewiston  Idaho  along the Columbia and Snake Rivers  was completed in 1975  88  One of the main commodities is wheat  mainly for export  More than 40 percent of all US wheat exports are barged on the Columbia River  96  The 1980 eruption of Mount St  Helens caused mudslides in the area  which reduced the Columbia s depth by 25 feet  7 6 m  for a 4 mile  6 4 km  stretch  disrupting Portland s economy  97   edit  Deeper shipping channel The Essayons  one of three Army Corps of Engineers dredges tasked with ongoing maintenance of the Columbia s shipping channel  began service in 1983  98  Efforts to maintain and improve the navigation channel have continued to the present day  In 1990  a new round of studies examined the possibility of further dredging on the lower Columbia  The plans were controversial from the start because of economic and environmental concerns  99  In 1999  Congress authorized deepening the channel between Portland and Astoria from 40 to 43 feet  12 13 m   which will make it possible for large container and grain ships to reach Portland and Vancouver  100  However  the project has met opposition because of concerns about stirring up toxic sediment on the riverbed  Portland based Northwest Environmental Advocates brought a lawsuit against the Army Corps of Engineers  but it was rejected by the Ninth U S  Circuit Court of Appeals in August 2006  101  The project includes measures to mitigate environmental damage  for instance  the U S  Army Corps of Engineers must restore 12 times the area of wetland damaged by the project  100  In early 2006  the Corps spilled 50 US gallons  190 L  of hydraulic oil into the Columbia  drawing further criticism from environmental organizations  102  Work on the project began in 2005 and is expected to conclude in 2010  The project s cost is estimated at  150 million  The federal government is paying 65 percent  Oregon and Washington are paying  27 million each  and six local ports are also contributing to the cost  100  103   edit  Dams  harnessing the river Fish ladder at John Day Dam  This dam  frequently referred to as the  fish killer   and its reservoir form the deadliest stretch of the river for young salmon  104  105  Dams on the Columbia have transformed the river into a

Columbia River and Columbia River Treaty In 1902  the United States Bureau of Reclamation was established to aid in the economic development of arid western states  106  One of its major undertakings was building Grand Coulee Dam to provide irrigation for the 600 thousand acres  2 400 km2  of the Columbia Basin Project in central Washington  107  With the onset of World War II  the focus of dam construction shifted to production of hydroelectricity  Irrigation efforts resumed after the war  River development occurred within the structure of the 1909 International Boundary Waters Treaty between the U S  and Canada  The United States Congress passed the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1925  which directed the Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Power Commission to explore the development of the nation s rivers  This prompted agencies to conduct the first formal financial analysis of hydroelectric development  the reports produced by various agencies were presented in House Document 308  Those reports  and subsequent related reports  are referred to as 308 Reports  108  In the late 1920s  political forces in the Northwestern United States generally favored private development of hydroelectric dams along the Columbia  But the overwhelming victories of gubernatorial candidate George W  Joseph in the 1930 Oregon Republican Party primary  and later his law partner Julius Meier  were understood to demonstrate strong public support for public ownership of dams  109  In 1933  President Franklin D  Roosevelt signed a bill that enabled the construction of the Bonneville and Grand Coulee dams as public works projects  The legislation was attributed to the efforts of Oregon Senator Charles McNary  Washington Senator Clarence Dill  and Oregon Congressman Charles Martin  among others  110  In 1948 floods swept through the Columbia watershed  destroying Vanport  then the second largest city in Oregon  and impacting cities as far north as Trail  British Columbia  111  The flooding prompted the United States Congress to pass the Flood Control Act of 1950  authorizing the federal development of additional dams and other flood control mechanisms  By that time  however  local communities had become wary of federal hydroelectric projects  and sought local control of new developments  a Public Utility District in Grant County  Washington ultimately began construction of the dam at Priest Rapids  112  In the 1960s  the United States and Canada signed the Columbia River Treaty  which focused on flood control and the maximization of downstream power generation  108  Canada agreed to build dams and provide reservoir storage  and the U S  agreed to deliver to Canada one half of the increase in U S  downstream power benefits as estimated five years in advance  113  Canada s obligation was met by building three dams  two on the Columbia  and one on the Duncan River   the last of which was completed in 1973  114  Today the main stem of the Columbia River has 14 dams  of which three are in Canada and 11 in the U S  Four mainstem dams and four lower Snake River dams contain navigation locks to allow ship and barge passage from the ocean as far as Lewiston  Idaho  The river system as a whole has more than 400 dams for hydroelectricity and irrigation  17  The dams address a variety of demands  including flood control  navigation  stream flow regulation  storage and delivery of stored waters  reclamation of public lands and Indian reservations  and the generation of hydroelectric power  115  This river may have been shaped by God  or glaciers  or the remnants of the inland sea  or gravity or a combination of all  but the Army Corps of Engineers controls it now  The Columbia rises and falls  not by the dictates of tide or rainfall  but by a computer activated  legally arbitrated  federally allocated schedule that changes only when significant litigation is concluded  or a United States Senator nears election time  In that sense  it is reliable  Timothy Egan  in The Good Rain 116  The larger U S  dams are owned and operated by the federal government  some by the Army Corps of Engineers and some by the Bureau of Reclamation   while the smaller dams are operated by public utility districts  and private power companies  The federally operated system is known as the Federal Columbia River Power System  which includes 31 dams on the Columbia and its tributaries  The system has altered the seasonal flow of the river in order to meet higher electricity demands during the winter  At the beginning of the 20th century  roughly 75 percent of the Columbia s flow occurred in the summer  between April and September  By 1980  the summer proportion had been lowered to about 50 percent  essentially eliminating the seasonal pattern  117  The installation of dams dramatically altered the landscape and ecosystem of the river  At one time  the Columbia was one of the top salmon producing river systems in the world  118  Previously active fishing sites  most notably Celilo Falls in the eastern Columbia River Gorge  have exhibited a sharp decline in fishing along the Columbia in the last century  and salmon populations have been dramatically reduced  119 Fish ladders have been installed at some dam sites to help the fish journey to spawning waters  Chief Joseph Dam has no fish ladders and completely blocks fish migration to the upper half of the Columbia River system  120   edit  Irrigation Prominent dams of the Columbia River Basin  Color indicates dam ownership    U S  Federal government   Public Utilities   State  provincial  or local government   Private The Bureau of Reclamation s Columbia Basin Project focused on the generally dry region of central Washington known as the Columbia Basin  which features rich loess soil  12  Several groups developed competing proposals  and in 1933  President Franklin D  Roosevelt authorized the Columbia Basin Project  The Grand Coulee Dam was the project s central component  upon completion  it pumped water up from the Columbia to fill the formerly dry Grand Coulee  forming Banks Lake  By 1935  the intended height of the dam was increased from a range between 200 and 300 feet  61 and 91 m  to 500 feet  150 m   a height that would extend the lake impounded by the dam all the way to the Canadian border  the project had grown from a local New Deal relief measure to a major national project  115  The project s initial purpose was irrigation  but the onset of World War II created a high demand for electricity  mainly for aluminum production and for the development of nuclear weapons at the Hanford Site  Irrigation began in 1951  121  The project provides water to more than 670 thousand acres  2 700 km2  of fertile but arid land in central Washington  12  transforming the region into a major agricultural center  Important crops include orchard fruit  potatoes  alfalfa  mint  beans  beets  and wine grapes  17  Since 1750  the Columbia has experienced six multi year droughts  The longest  lasting 12 years in the mid 19th century  reduced the river s flow to 20 percent below average  Scientists have expressed concern that a similar drought would have grave consequences in a region so dependent on the Columbia  122  In 1992 1993  a lesser drought affected farmers  hydroelectric power producers  shippers  and wildlife managers  122  Many farmers in central Washington build dams on their property for irrigation and to control frost on their crops  The Washington Department of Ecology  using new techniques involving aerial photographs  estimated there may be as many as a hundred such dams in the area  most of which are illegal  Six such dams have failed in recent years  causing hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage to crops and public roads  Fourteen farms in the area have gone through the permitting process to build such dams legally  123   edit  Hydroelectricity Roll on  Columbia  roll on

Columbia s heavy flow and extreme elevation drop over a short distance  2 16 feet per mile  40 9 cm km   give it tremendous capacity for hydroelectricity generation  In comparison  the Mississippi drops less than 0 65 feet per mile  12 3 cm km   The Columbia alone possesses one third of the United States s hydroelectric potential  124  The largest of the 150 hydroelectric projects  the Grand Coulee Dam and the Chief Joseph Dam  are also the largest in the United States 125  126  and among the largest in the world  127  Inexpensive hydropower supported the emergence of an extensive aluminum industry  which draws tremendous amounts of power  Until 2000  the Northwestern United States produced up to 17 percent of the world s aluminum and 40 percent of the aluminum produced in the U S  128  But the commoditization of power in the early 21st century  coupled with drought that reduced the generation capacity of the river  damaged the industry  By 2001  Columbia River aluminum producers had idled 80 percent of its production capacity  128  and by 2003  the entire U S  produced only 15 percent of the world s aluminum  many smelters among the Columbia having gone dormant or out of business  129  130  Power remains relatively inexpensive along the Columbia  and in recent years high tech companies like Google have begun to move server farm operations into the area to avail themselves of cheap power  131  Downriver of Grand Coulee  each dam s reservoir is closely regulated by the Bonneville Power Administration  BPA   Army Corps of Engineers  and various Washington Public Utility Districts to ensure flow  flood control  and power generation objectives are met  Increasingly  hydro power operations are required to meet standards under the U S  Endangered Species Act and other agreements to manage operations to minimize impacts on salmon and other fish  and some conservation and fishing groups support removing four dams on the lower Snake River  the largest tributary of the Columbia  132  In 1941  the BPA hired Oklahoma folksinger Woody Guthrie to write songs for a documentary film 133  promoting the benefits of hydropower  In the month he spent traveling the region Guthrie wrote 26 songs  which have become an important part of the cultural history of the region  134  135   edit  Ecology and environment  edit  Fish migration See also  Environmental impacts of reservoirs Seining salmon on the Columbia River  1914 In their natural life cycle  salmon die shortly after spawning  Eagle Creek in Oregon  November 2007  The Columbia supports several species of anadromous fish that migrate between the Pacific Ocean and fresh water tributaries of the river  Coho and Chinook  also known as  king   salmon  and steelhead  all of the genus Oncorhynchus  are ocean fish that migrate up the rivers at the end of their life cycles to spawn  136 White sturgeon  which take 15 to 25 years to mature  typically migrate between the ocean and the upstream habitat several times during their lives  137  Salmon populations declined dramatically after the establishment of canneries in 1867  By 1908  there was widespread concern about the decline of salmon and sturgeon  In that year  the people of Oregon passed two laws under their newly instituted program of Citizens  Initiatives limiting fishing on the Columbia and other rivers  138  Then in 1948  another initiative banned the use of seine nets  devices invented by Native Americans  and refined by later settlers  altogether  139  Dams interrupt the migration of anadromous fish  Salmon and steelhead return to the streams in which they were born to spawn  where dams prevent their return  entire populations of salmon die  Some of the Columbia and Snake River dams employ fish ladders  which are effective to varying degrees at allowing these fish to travel upstream  Another problem exists for the juvenile salmon headed downstream to the ocean  Previously  this journey would have taken two to three weeks  With river currents slowed by the dams  and the Columbia converted from wild river to a series of slackwater pools  the journey can take several months  which increases the mortality rate  140  In some cases  the Army Corps of Engineers transports juvenile fish downstream by truck or river barge  The Chief Joseph Dam and several dams on the Columbia s tributaries entirely block migration  and there are no migrating fish on the river above these dams  Sturgeon have different migration habits and can survive without ever visiting the ocean  In many upstream areas cut off from the ocean by dams  sturgeon simply live upstream of the dam  141  Not all fish have suffered from the modifications to the river  the northern pikeminnow  formerly known as the squawfish  thrives in the warmer  slower water created by the dams  Research in the mid 1980s found that juvenile salmon were suffering substantially from the predatory pikeminnow  142  and in 1990  in the interest of protecting salmon  a  bounty  program was established to reward anglers for catching pikeminnow  143  In 1994  the salmon catch was smaller than usual in the rivers of Oregon  Washington  and British Columbia  causing concern among commercial fishermen  government agencies  and tribal leaders  144  145  U S  government intervention  to which the states of Alaska  Idaho  and Oregon objected  included an 11 day closure of an Alaska fishery  146  In April 1994 the Pacific Fisheries Management Council unanimously approved the strictest regulations in 18 years  banning all commercial salmon fishing for that year from Cape Falcon north to the Canadian border  67  147  In the winter of 1994  the return of coho salmon far exceeded expectations  which was attributed in part to the fishing ban  148  Also in 1994  United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt first proposed the removal of several Pacific Northwest dams because of their impact on salmon spawning  149  The Northwest Power Planning Council approved a plan that provided more water for fish and less for electricity  irrigation  and transportation  150  Environmental advocates have called for the removal of certain dams in the Columbia system in the years since  Of the 227 major dams in the Columbia River drainage basin  the four Washington dams on the lower Snake River are often identified for removal  151  notably in an ongoing lawsuit concerning a Bush administration plan for salmon recovery  132  These dams and reservoirs currently limit the recovery of upriver salmon runs to Idaho s Salmon and Clearwater rivers  152  Historically  the Snake produced over 1 5 million spring and summer Chinook Salmon  a number that has dwindled to several thousand in recent years  153 Idaho Power Company s Hells Canyon dams have no fish ladders  and do not pass juvenile salmon downstream   and thus allow no steelhead or salmon to migrate above Hells Canyon  In 2007  the destruction of the Marmot Dam on the Sandy River was the first dam removal in the system  154  There are plans to remove the Condit Dam on Washington s White Salmon River  and the Milltown Dam on the Clark Fork in Montana  155   edit  Pollution In southeastern Washington  a 50 mile  80 km  stretch of the river passes through the Hanford Site  established in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project  The site served as a plutonium production complex  with nine nuclear reactors and related facilities located on the banks of the river  From 1944 to 1971  pump systems drew cooling water from the river and  after treating this water for use by the reactors  returned it to the river  Before being released back into the river  the used water was held in large tanks known as retention basins for up to six hours  Longer lived isotopes were not affected by this retention  and several terabecquerels entered the river every day  By 1957  the eight plutonium production reactors at Hanford dumped a daily average of 50 000 curies of radioactive material into the Columbia  156  These releases were kept secret by the federal government until the release of declassified documents in the late 1980s  157  Radiation was measured downstream as far west as the Washington and Oregon coasts  158  Nuclear reactors at the Hanford site along the river The nuclear reactors were decommissioned at the end of the Cold War  and the Hanford site is now the focus of the world s largest environmental cleanup  managed by the Department of Energy under the oversight of the Washington Department of Ecology and the Environmental Protection Agency  159  Nearby aquifers contain an estimated 270 billion US gallons  1 billion m3  of groundwater contaminated by high level nuclear waste that has leaked out of Hanford s massive underground storage tanks  160  As of 2008 update   1 million US gallons  3 785 m3  of highly radioactive waste is traveling through groundwater toward the Columbia River  This waste is expected to reach the river in 12 to 50 years if cleanup does not proceed on schedule  161  In addition to concerns about nuclear waste  numerous other pollutants are found in the river  These include chemical pesticides  bacteria  arsenic  dioxins  and polychlorinated biphenyl  PCB   162  Studies have also found significant levels of toxins in fish and the waters they inhabit within the basin  Accumulation of toxins in fish threatens the survival of fish species  and human consumption of these fish can lead to health problems  Water quality is also an important factor in the survival of other wildlife and plants that grow in the Columbia River drainage basin  The states  Indian tribes  and federal government are all engaged in efforts to restore and improve the water  land  and air quality of the Columbia River drainage basin and have committed to work together to enhance and accomplish critical ecosystem restoration efforts  A number of cleanup efforts are currently underway  including Superfund projects at Portland Harbor  Hanford  and Lake Roosevelt  163  Timber industry activity further contaminates river water  notably in the increased sediment runoff that results from clearcuts  The Northwest Forest Plan  a piece of federal legislation from 1994  mandated that timber companies consider the environmental impacts of their practices on rivers like the Columbia  164  On July 1  2003  Christopher Swain of Portland  Oregon  became the first person to swim the Columbia River s entire length  in an effort to raise public awareness about the river s environmental health  162  165  166   edit  Watershed Near The Gorge Amphitheater in George  Washington Main article  Columbia Basin Most of the Columbia s drainage basin  which  at 258 000 square miles or 670 000 square kilometres  is about the size of France  167  lies roughly between the Rocky Mountains on the east and the Cascade Mountains on the west  In the United States and Canada the term watershed is often used to mean drainage basin  The term Columbia Basin is used to refer not only to the entire drainage basin but also to subsets of the river s full watershed  such as the relatively flat and unforested area in eastern Washington bounded by the Cascades  the Rocky Mountains  and the Blue Mountains  168  Within the watershed are diverse landforms including mountains  arid plateaus  river valleys  rolling uplands  and deep gorges  Grand Teton National Park lies in the watershed  as well as parts of Yellowstone National Park  Glacier National Park  Mount Rainier National Park  and North Cascades National Park  Canadian National Parks in the watershed include Kootenay National Park  Yoho National Park  Glacier National Park  and Mount Revelstoke National Park  Hells Canyon  the deepest gorge in North America  167  and the Columbia Gorge are in the watershed  Vegetation varies widely  ranging from Western hemlock and Western redcedar in the moist regions to sagebrush in the arid regions  169  The watershed provides habitat for 609 known fish and wildlife species  including the bull trout  Bald Eagle  gray wolf  grizzly bear  and Canada lynx  167  The World Wide Fund for Nature  WWF  divides the waters of the Columbia and its tributaries into three freshwater ecoregions  naming them  Columbia Glaciated  Columbia Unglaciated  and Upper Snake  The Columbia Glaciated ecoregion  making up about a third of the total watershed  lies in the north and was covered with ice sheets during the Pleistocene  The ecoregion includes the mainstem Columbia north of the Snake River and tributaries such as the Yakima  Okanagan  Pend Oreille  Clark Fork  and Kootenay Rivers  The effects of glaciation include a number of large lakes and a relatively low diversity of freshwater fish  The Upper Snake ecoregion is defined as the Snake River watershed above Shoshone Falls  which totally blocks fish migration  This region has 14 species of fish  many of which are endemic  The Columbia Unglaciated ecoregion makes up the rest of the watershed  It includes the mainstem Columbia below the Snake River and tributaries such as the Salmon  John Day  Deschutes  and lower Snake Rivers  Of the three ecoregions it is the richest in terms of freshwater species diversity  There are 35 species of fish  of which four are endemic  There are also high levels of mollusk endemism  170  171  In 2000  about six million people lived within the Columbia s drainage basin  Of this total about 2 4 million people lived in Oregon  1 7 million in Washington  1 million in Idaho  half a million in British Columbia  and 0 4 million in Montana  Population in the watershed has been rising for many decades and is projected to rise to about 10 million by 2030  The highest population densities are found west of the Cascade Mountains along the I 5 corridor  especially in the Portland Vancouver urban area  High densities are also found around Spokane  Washington  and Boise  Idaho  Although much of the watershed is rural and sparsely populated  areas with recreational and scenic values are growing rapidly  The central Oregon county of Deschutes is the fastest growing in the state  Populations have also been growing just east of the Cascades in central Washington around the city of Yakima and the Tri Cities area  Projections for the coming decades assume growth throughout the watershed  including the interior  The Canadian part of the Okanagan subbasin is also growing rapidly  169  Climate varies greatly from place to place within the watershed  Elevation ranges from sea level at the river mouth to more than 14 000 feet  4 300 m  in the mountains  and temperatures vary with elevation  The highest peak is Mount Rainier  at 14 411 feet  4 392 m   High elevations have cold winters and short cool summers  interior regions are subject to great temperature variability and severe droughts  Over some of the watershed  especially west of the Cascade Mountains  precipitation maximums occur in winter  when Pacific storms come ashore  Atmospheric conditions block the flow of moisture in summer  which is generally dry except for occasional thunderstorms in the interior  169  In some of the eastern parts of the watershed  especially shrub steppe regions with Continental climate patterns  precipitation maximums occur in early summer  172  Annual precipitation varies from more than 100 inches  250 cm  a year in the Cascades to less than 8 inches  20 cm  in the interior  Much of the watershed gets less than 12 inches  30 cm  a year  169  Several major North American drainage basins and many minor ones share a common border with the Columbia River s drainage basin  To the east  in northern Wyoming and Montana  the Continental Divide separates the Columbia watershed from the Mississippi Missouri watershed  which empties into the Gulf of Mexico  To the northeast  mostly along the southern border between British Columbia and Alberta  the Continental Divide separates the Columbia watershed from the Nelson Lake Winnipeg Saskatchewan watershed  which empties into Hudson Bay  The Mississippi and Nelson watersheds are separated by the Laurentian Divide  which meets the Continental Divide at Triple Divide Peak near the headwaters of the Columbia s Flathead River tributary  This point marks the meeting of three of North America s main drainage patterns  to the Pacific Ocean  to Hudson Bay  and to the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico  173  174  Further north along the Continental Divide  a short portion of the combined Continental and Laurentian divides separate the Columbia watershed from the MacKenzie Slave Athabasca watershed  which empties into the Arctic Ocean  The Nelson and Mackenzie watersheds are separated by a divide between streams flowing to the Arctic Ocean and those of the Hudson Bay watershed  175  This divide meets the Continental Divide at Snow Dome  also known as Dome   near the northernmost bend of the Columbia River  176  To the southeast  in western Wyoming  another divide separates the Columbia watershed from the Colorado Green watershed  which empties into the Gulf of California  The Columbia  Colorado  and Mississippi watersheds meet at Three Waters Mountain in the Wind River Range of Wyoming  177  To the south  in Oregon  Nevada  Utah  Idaho  and Wyoming  the Columbia watershed is divided from the Great Basin  whose several watersheds are endorheic  not emptying into any ocean but rather drying up or sinking into sumps  173  Great Basin watersheds that share a border with the Columbia watershed include Harney Basin  Humboldt River  and Great Salt Lake  173  The associated triple divide points are Commissary Ridge North  Wyoming  178  and Sproats Meadow Northwest  Oregon  179  To the north  mostly in British Columbia  the Columbia watershed borders the Fraser River watershed  To the west and southwest the Columbia watershed borders a number of smaller watersheds that drain to the Pacific Ocean  such as the Klamath River in Oregon and California and the Puget Sound Basin in Washington  173   edit  Major tributaries See also  List of tributaries of the Columbia River Deschutes River at its confluence with the Columbia The Columbia receives more than 60 significant tributaries  The four largest that empty directly into the Columbia  measured either by discharge or by size of watershed  are the Snake River  mostly in Idaho   the Willamette River  in northwest Oregon   the Kootenay River  mostly in British Columbia   and the Pend Oreille River  mostly in northern Washington and Idaho  also known as the lower part of the Clark Fork   Each of these four averages more than 20 000 cubic feet per second  570 m3 s  and drains an area of more than 20 000 square miles  52 000 km2   The Snake is by far the largest tributary  Its watershed of 108 000 square miles  280 000 km2  is larger than the state of Idaho  Its discharge is nearly equal to the Columbia s at the rivers  confluence  Compared to the Columbia above the confluence  the Snake is longer  113    and its drainage basin is larger  104    The Pend Oreille river system  including its main tributaries  the Clark Fork and Flathead rivers  is also similar in size to the Columbia at their confluence  Compared to the Columbia River above the two rivers  confluence  the
