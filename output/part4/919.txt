Americans  and formerly as American Negroes  are citizens or residents of the United States who have at least partial ancestry from any of the native populations of Sub Saharan Africa  3  Most African Americans are of West and Central African descent and are descendants of enslaved Africans within the boundaries of the present United States  4  5  However  some immigrants from African  Caribbean  Central American or South American nations  or their descendants  may be identified or self identify with the term  3  African Americans make up the single largest racial minority in the United States  6  African American history starts in the 16th century with African slaves who quickly rose up against the Spanish explorer Lucas V squez de Ayll n and progresses to the present day  with Barack Obama as the 44th and current President of the United States  Between those landmarks there have been events and issues  both resolved and ongoing  including slavery  racism  reconstruction  development of the African American community  participation in the great military conflicts of the United States  racial segregation  and the Civil Rights Movement  Contents 1 History 1 1 Slavery era

Slavery era An artist s conception of Crispus Attucks  1723 1770   the first  martyr  of the American Revolution  Main articles  Slavery in the United States and Atlantic slave trade The first African slaves arrived in the present day United States as part of the San Miguel de Gualdape colony  most likely located in the Winyah Bay area of present day South Carolina   founded by Spanish explorer Lucas V squez de Ayll n in 1526  The ill fated colony was almost immediately disrupted by a fight over leadership  during which the slaves revolted and fled the colony to seek refuge among local Native Americans  De Ayll n and many of the colonists died shortly afterwards of an epidemic and the colony was abandoned  leaving the escaped slaves behind on North American soil  In 1565  the colony of Saint Augustine in Florida  founded by Pedro Menendez de Aviles  became the first permanent European settlement in North America  It included an unknown number of free and enslaved Africans that were part of this colonial expedition  The first recorded Africans in British North America  including most of the future United States  arrived in 1619 in Jamestown  Virginia  As English settlers died from harsh conditions  more and more Africans were brought to work as laborers  The Africans were likely treated as indentured servants  similar in legal position to poor English indenturees  who traded several years labor in exchange for passage to America  7  Africans could legally raise crops and cattle to purchase their freedom  8  They raised families  marrying other Africans and sometimes intermarrying with Native Americans or English settlers  9  By the 1640s and 1650s  several African families owned farms around Jamestown and some became wealthy by colonial standards  The popular conception of a race based slave system did not fully develop until the 18th century  The Dutch West India Company introduced slavery in 1625 with the importation of eleven black slaves into New Amsterdam  present day New York City   All the colony s slaves  however  were freed upon its surrender to the British  10 Massachusetts was the first British colony to legally recognize slavery in 1641  It was not until 1662 that Virginia ruled that a slave mother s children would remain slaves  11  The first black congregations and churches were organized before 1800 in both northern and southern cities following the Great Awakening  By 1775  Africans made up 20  of the population in the American colonies  which made them the second largest ethnic group after the English  12  During the 1770s  Africans  both enslaved and free  helped rebellious English colonists secure American Independence by defeating the British in the American Revolution  13  Africans and Englishmen fought side by side and were fully integrated  14 James Armistead  an African American  played a large part in making possible the 1781 Yorktown victory  which established the United States as an independent nation  15  Other prominent African Americans were Prince Whipple and Oliver Cromwell  who are both depicted in the front of the boat in George Washington s famous 1776 Crossing the Delaware portrait  By 1860  there were 3 5 million enslaved African Americans in the United States due to the Atlantic slave trade  and another 500 000 African Americans lived free across the country  16  In 1863  during the American Civil War  President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation  The proclamation declared that all slaves in states which had seceded from the Union were free  17  Advancing Union troops enforced the proclamation with Texas being the last state to be emancipated in 1865  18  Reconstruction and Jim Crow Jesse Owens shook racial stereotypes both with Nazis and segregationists in the USA at the 1936 Berlin olympics  Main articles  Reconstruction era of the United States and Jim Crow laws African Americans quickly set up congregations for themselves  as well as schools  community and civic associations  to have space away from white control or oversight  While the post war reconstruction era was initially a time of progress for African Americans  in the late 1890s  Southern states enacted Jim Crow laws to enforce racial segregation and disenfranchisement  19  Most African Americans followed the Jim Crow laws  using a mask of compliance to prevent becoming victims of racially motivated violence  To maintain self esteem and dignity  African Americans such as Anthony Overton and Mary McLeod Bethune continued to build their own schools  churches  banks  social clubs  and other businesses  20  In the last decade of the 19th century  racially discriminatory laws and racial violence aimed at African Americans began to mushroom in the United States  These discriminatory acts included racial segregation upheld by the United States Supreme Court decision in Plessy v  Ferguson in 1896 21  which was legally mandated by southern states and nationwide at the local level of government  voter suppression or disenfranchisement in the southern states  denial of economic opportunity or resources nationwide  and private acts of violence and mass racial violence aimed at African Americans unhindered or encouraged by government authorities  Great Migration and Civil Rights Movement An African American boy outside of Cincinnati  Ohio in the 1940s March on Washington  August 28  1963  shows civil rights and union leaders Main articles  Great Migration  African American  and African American Civil Rights Movement  1955 1968  The desperate conditions of African Americans in the South that sparked the Great Migration of the early 20th century  22  combined with a growing African American community in the Northern United States  led to a movement to fight violence and discrimination against African Americans that  like abolitionism before it  crossed racial lines  The Civil Rights Movement from 1954 to 1968 was directed at abolishing racial discrimination against African Americans  particularly in the Southern United States  The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the conditions which brought it into being are credited with putting pressure on President John F  Kennedy and Lyndon B  Johnson  Johnson put his support behind passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that banned discrimination in public accommodations  employment  and labor unions  and the Voting Rights Act  1965   which expanded federal authority over states to ensure black political participation through protection of voter registration and elections  By 1966  the emergence of the Black Power movement  which lasted from 1966 to 1975  expanded upon the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include economic and political self sufficiency  and freedom from white authority  23  Post Civil Rights era Main article  Post Civil Rights Era African American history Politically and economically  blacks have made substantial strides during the post civil rights era  In 1989  Douglas Wilder became the first African American elected governor in U S  history  There is currently one black governor  governor Deval Patrick of Massachusetts  Clarence Thomas became the second African American Supreme Court Justice  In 1992 Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois became the first black woman elected to the U S  Senate  There were 8 936 black officeholders in the United States in 2000  showing a net increase of 7 467 since 1970  In 2001 there were 484 black mayors  On November 4  2008  Democratic Senator Barack Obama defeated Republican Senator John McCain to become the first African American to be elected President  At least 95 percent of African American voters voted for Obama  24  25  He also received overwhelming support from young and educated whites  a majority of Asians  Hispanics  26  and Native Americans 27  not in citation given  picking up a number of new states in the Democratic electoral column  24  25  Obama lost the overall white vote  although he won a larger proportion of white votes than any previous nonincumbent Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter  28  The following year Michael S  Steele was elected the first African American chairman of the national Republican Party  29  Demographics African Americans as a percentage of total population  2000  U S  Census map indicating U S  counties

populations  and List of U S  states by African American population In 1790  when the first U S  Census was taken  Africans  including slaves and free people  numbered about 760 000 about 19 3  of the population  In 1860  at the start of the Civil War  the African American population had increased to 4 4 million  but the percentage rate dropped to 14  of the overall population of the country  The vast majority were slaves  with only 488 000 counted as  freemen   By 1900  the black population had doubled and reached 8 8 million  In 1910  about 90  of African Americans lived in the South  but large numbers began migrating north looking for better job opportunities and living conditions  and to escape Jim Crow laws and racial violence  The Great Migration  as it was called  spanned the 1890s to the 1970s  From 1916 through the 1960s  more than 6 million black people moved north  But in the 1970s and 1980s  that trend reversed  with more African Americans moving south to the Sun Belt than leaving it  The following table of the African American population in the United States over time shows that the African American population  as a percentage of the total population  declined until 1930 and has been rising since then  African Americans in the United States 30  Year Number    of total population    Change  10 yr  Slaves    in slavery 1790 757 208 19 3   highest    697 681

population reached about 30 million and represented 12  of the U S  population  roughly the same proportion as in 1900  31  In 2010  38 9 million Americans identified as  Black or African American   representing 12 6  of the population  Controversy has surrounded the  accurate  population count of African Americans for decades  The NAACP believed it was under counted intentionally to minimize the significance of the black population in order to reduce their political power base citation needed   At the time of the 2000 Census  54 8  of African Americans lived in the South  In that year  17 6  of African Americans lived in the Northeast and 18 7  in the Midwest  while only 8 9  lived in the western states  The west does have a sizable black population in certain areas  however  California  the nation s most populous state  has the fifth largest African American population  only behind New York  Texas  Georgia  and Florida  According to the 2000 Census  approximately 2 05  of African Americans identified as Hispanic or Latino in origin  6  many of whom may be of Brazilian  Puerto Rican  Dominican  Cuban  Haitian  or other Latin American descent  The only self reported ancestral groups larger than African Americans are the Irish and Germans  32  Because many African Americans trace their ancestry to colonial American origins  some simply self identify as  American   citation needed  U S  cities Further information  List of U S  cities with large African American populations and List of U S  metropolitan areas with large African American populations Almost 58  of African Americans lived in metropolitan areas in 2000  With over 2 million black residents  New York City had the largest black urban population in the United States in 2000  overall the city has a 28  black population  Chicago has the second largest black population  with almost 1 6 million African Americans in its metropolitan area  representing about 18 percent of the total metropolitan population  Among cities of 100 000 or more  Detroit  Michigan had the highest percentage of black residents of any U S  city in 2010  with 82   Other large cities with African American majorities include New Orleans  Louisiana  60    Baltimore  Maryland  63   Atlanta  Georgia  54    Memphis  Tennessee  61    and Washington  D C   50 7    The nation s most affluent county with an African American majority is Prince George s County  Maryland  with a median income of  62 467  Within that county  among the wealthiest communities are Glenn Dale  Maryland and Fort Washington  Maryland  Other affluent predominantly African American counties include Dekalb County in Georgia  and Charles City County in Virginia  Queens County  New York is the only county with a population of 65 000 or more where African Americans have a higher median household income than White Americans  33  Religion Main articles  Black church  Nation of Islam  and Black Hebrew Israelites Mount Zion United Methodist Church is the oldest African American congregation in Washington  D C  The majority of African Americans are Protestant of whom many follow the historically black churches  34  Black church refers to churches which minister predominantly African American congregations  Black congregations were first established by freed slaves at the end of the 17th century  and later when slavery was abolished more African Americans were allowed to create a unique form of Christianity that was culturally influenced by African spiritual traditions  35  According to a 2007 survey  more than half of the African American population are part of the historically black churches  36  The largest Protestant denomination among African Americans are the Baptists  37  distributed in four denominations  the largest being the National Baptist Convention and the National Baptist Convention of America  38  The second largest are the Methodists  39  the largest sects are the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church  38  40  Pentecostals are mainly part of the Church of God in Christ  38  About 16  of African American Christians are members of white Protestant communions  39  these denominations  which include the United Church of Christ  mostly have a 2 to 3  African American membership  41  There are also large numbers of Roman Catholics  constituting 5  of the African American population  36  Of the total number of Jehovah s Witnesses  22  are black  34  Malcolm Shabazz Mosque in Harlem  New York City Some African Americans follow Islam  Historically  between 15 to 30  of enslaved Africans brought to the Americas were Muslims  but most of these Africans were converted to Christianity during the era of American slavery  42  However during the 20th century  some African Americans converted to Islam  mainly through the influence of black nationalist groups that preached with distinctive Islamic practices  these include the Moorish Science Temple of America  though the largest organization was the Nation of Islam  founded during the 1930s  which attracted at least 20 000 people as of 1963  43  44  prominent members included activist Malcolm X and boxer Muhammad Ali  45  Religious affiliation of African Americans  Malcolm X is considered the first person to start the movement among African Americans towards mainstream Islam  after he left the Nation and made the pilgrimage to Mecca  46  In 1975  Warith Deen Mohammed  the son of Elijah Muhammad who took control of the Nation after his death  guided majority of its members to orthodox Islam  47  However  few members rejected these changes  in particular Louis Farrakhan  who revived the Nation of Islam in 1978 based on its original teachings  African American Muslims constitute 20  of the total U S  Muslim population  48  the majority are Sunni or orthodox Muslims  some of these identify under the community of W  Deen Mohammed  49  50  The Nation of Islam led by Louis Farrakhan has a membership from 20 000 50 000 members  51  There are relatively few African American Jews  estimates of their number range from 20 000 52  to 200 000  53  Most of these Jews are part of mainstream groups such as the Reform  Conservative  or Orthodox branches of Judaism  although there are significant numbers of people who are part of non mainstream Jewish groups  largely the Black Hebrew Israelites  whose beliefs include the claim that African Americans are descended from the Biblical Israelites  54  Contemporary issues African Americans have improved their social and economic standing significantly since the Civil Rights Movement and recent decades have witnessed the expansion of a robust  African American middle class across the United States  Unprecedented access to higher education and employment in addition to representation in the highest levels of American government has been gained by African Americans in the post civil rights era  Nevertheless  due in part to the legacy of slavery  racism and discrimination  African Americans as a group remain at a pronounced economic  educational and social disadvantage in many areas relative to European Americans  Persistent social  economic and political issues for many African Americans include inadequate health care access and delivery  institutional racism and discrimination in housing  education  policing  criminal justice and employment  crime  poverty and substance abuse  citation needed  One of the most serious and long standing issues within African American communities is poverty  Poverty itself is a hardship as it is related to marital stress and dissolution  health problems  low educational attainment  deficits in psychological functioning  and crime  55  In 2004  24 7  of African American families lived below the poverty level  56  In 2007  the average African American income was  33 916  compared with  54 920 for whites  57  Politics and social issues President Barack Obama at White House Easter Egg Roll  Collectively  African Americans are more involved in the American political process than other minority groups in the United States  indicated by the highest level of voter registration and participation in elections among these groups in 2004  58  African Americans collectively attain higher levels of education than immigrants to the United States  58  African Americans also have the highest level of Congressional representation of any minority group in the U S  59  The large majority of African Americans support the Democratic Party  In the 2004 Presidential Election  Democrat John Kerry received 88  of the African American vote compared to 11  for Republican George W  Bush  60  Although there is an African American lobby in foreign policy  it has not had the impact that African American organizations have had in domestic policy  61  Historically  African Americans were supporters of the Republican Party because it was Republican President Abraham Lincoln who helped in granting freedom to American slaves  at the time  the Republicans and Democrats represented the sectional interests of the North and South  respectively  rather than any specific ideology  and both right and left were represented equally in both parties  The African American trend of voting for Democrats can be traced back to the 1930s during the Great Depression  when Franklin D  Roosevelt s New Deal program provided economic relief to African Americans  Roosevelt s New Deal coalition turned the Democratic Party into an organization of the working class and their liberal allies  regardless of region  The African American vote became even more solidly Democratic when Democratic presidents John F  Kennedy and Lyndon B  Johnson pushed for civil rights legislation during the 1960s  After over 50 years  marriage rates for all Americans began to decline while divorce rates and out of wedlock births have climbed  62  These changes have been greatest among African Americans  After more than 70 years of racial parity black marriage rates began to fall behind whites  62  Single parent households have become common  and according to US census figures released in January 2010  only 38 percent of black children live with both their parents  63  Despite that and heavy Democratic leanings  African Americans favor  traditional American values  about family and marriage  While 52  of Democrats support same sex marriage  only 30  of black Democrats do  In 2008  though Democrats overwhelmingly voted  64   against the California ballot proposition banning gay marriage  blacks overwhelmingly approved  70  in favor  it  more than any other racial group  64  The high profile candidacy of Barack Obama is credited with increasing black turnout on the bill which has been seen as the crucial difference in its passing  65  Blacks also hold far more conservative opinions on abortion  extramarital sex  and raising children out of wedlock than Democrats as a whole  65  On financial issues  however  African Americans are very much in line with Democrats  generally supporting a more progressive tax structure to provide more services and reduce injustice and as well as more government spending on social services  66  News media and coverage BET founder Robert L  Johnson with former U S  President George W  Bush  Some activists and academics contend that news media coverage of African American news concerns or dilemmas is inadequate 67  68  69  or the news media present distorted images of African Americans  70  To combat this  Robert L  Johnson founded Black Entertainment Television  a network that targets young African Americans and urban audiences in the United States  Most programming on the network consists of rap and R amp B music videos and urban oriented movies and series  The channel also shows syndicated television series  original programs  and some public affairs programs  On Sunday mornings  BET broadcasts a lineup of network produced Christian programming  other  non affiliated Christian programs are also shown during the early morning hours daily  BET is now a global network that reaches 85 million viewers in the Caribbean  Canada  and the United Kingdom  71  In addition to BET there is Centric  which is a spin off cable television channel of BET  created originally as BET on Jazz to showcase jazz music related programming  especially that of black jazz musicians  Programming has been expanded to include a block of urban programs as well as some R amp B  neo soul  and alternative hip hop  with the focus on jazz reduced to low profile hours  72  TV One is another African American oriented network and a direct competitor to BET  targeting African American adults with a broad range of programming  The network airs original lifestyle and entertainment oriented shows  movies  fashion and music programming  as well as classic series such as 227  Good Times  Martin  Boston Public and It s Showtime at the Apollo  The network primarily owned by Radio One  Founded and controlled by Catherine Hughes  it is one of the nation s largest radio broadcasting companies and the largest African American owned radio broadcasting company in the United States  73  Other African American networks scheduled to launch in 2009 are the Black Television News Channel founded by former Congressman J  C  Watts and Better Black Television founded by Percy Miller  74  75  In June 2009  NBC News launched a new website named The Grio 76  in partnership with the production team that created the black documentary film  Meeting David Wilson  It is the first African American video news site which focuses on underrepresented stories in existing national news  The Grio consists of a broad spectrum of original video packages  news articles  and contributor blogs on topics including breaking news  politics  health  business  entertainment and Black History  77  Education Main article  Education outcomes in the United States by race and other classifications Charles F  Bolden  Jr  is the current Administrator of NASA By 2000  African Americans had advanced greatly  They still lagged overall in education attainment compared to white or Asian Americans  with 14 percent with four year and 5 percent with advanced degrees  though it was higher than for other minorities  78  African Americans attend college at about half the rate of whites  but at a greater rate than Americans of Hispanic origin  More African American women attend and complete college than men  Black schools for kindergarten through twelfth grade students were common throughout the U S   and a pattern towards re segregation is currently occurring across the country  79  Neil deGrasse Tyson is an astrophysicist  Historically black colleges and universities remain today which were originally set up when segregated colleges did not admit African Americans  As late as 1947  about one third of African Americans over 65 were considered to lack the literacy to read and write their own names  By 1969  illiteracy as it had been traditionally defined  had been largely eradicated among younger African Americans  80  US Census surveys showed that by 1998  89 percent of African Americans aged 25 to 29 had completed high school  less than whites or Asians  but more than Hispanics  On many college entrance  standardized tests and grades  African Americans have historically lagged behind whites  but some studies suggest that the achievement gap has been closing  Many policy makers have proposed that this gap can and will be eliminated through policies such as affirmative action  desegregation  and multiculturalism  81  In Chicago  Marva Collins  an African American educator  created a low cost private school specifically for the purpose of teaching low income African American children whom the public school system had labeled as being  learning disabled   82  One article about Marva Collins  school stated  Working with students having the worst of backgrounds  those who were working far below grade level  and even those who had been labeled as  unteachable   Marva was able to overcome the obstacles  News of third grade students reading at ninth grade level  four year olds learning to read in only a few months  outstanding test scores  disappearance of behavioral problems  second graders studying Shakespeare  and other incredible reports  astounded the public  83  During the 2006 2007 school year  Collins  school charged  5 500 for tuition  and parents said that the school did a much better job than the Chicago public school system  84  Meanwhile  during the 2007 2008 year  Chicago public school officials claimed that their budget of  11 300 per student was not enough  85  Economic status Oprah Winfrey  the wealthiest African American of the 20th century  86  87  88  A pair of economists estimate that Winfrey s endorsement of Barack Obama delivered one million votes for him in the close 2008 Democratic primaries  89  Economically  African Americans have benefited from the advances made during the Civil Rights era  particularly among the educated  but not without the lingering effects of historical marginalization when considered as a whole  The racial disparity in poverty rates has narrowed  The black middle class has grown substantially  In 2000  47  of African Americans owned their homes  The poverty rate among African Americans has decreased from 26 5  in 1998 to 24 7  in 2004  56  African Americans are the second largest consumer group in America with a combined buying power of over  892 billion currently and likely over  1 1 trillion by 2012  90  91  In 2002 African American owned businesses accounted for 1 2 million of the US s 23 million businesses  92  As of 2011 African American owned business account for approximately 2 million US businesses  93  Black owned businesses experienced the largest growth in number of businesses among minorities from 2002 to 2011  93  In 2004  African American workers had the second highest median earnings of American minority groups after Asian Americans  and African Americans had the highest level of male female income parity of all ethnic groups in the United States  94  Also  among American minority groups  only Asian Americans were more likely to hold white collar occupations  management  professional  and related fields   95  and African Americans were no more or less likely than European Americans to work in the service industry  96  In 2001  over half of African American households of married couples earned  50 000 or more  96  Although in the same year African Americans were over represented among the nation s poor  this was directly related to the disproportionate percentage of African American families headed by single women  such families are collectively poorer  regardless of ethnicity  96  By 2006  gender continued to be the primary factor in income level  with the median earnings of African American men more than those black and non black American women overall and in all educational levels  97  98  99  100  101  At the same time  among American men  income disparities were significant  the median income of African American men was approximately 76 cents for every dollar of their European American counterparts  although the gap narrowed somewhat with a rise in educational level  97  102  Overall  the median earnings of African American men were 72 cents for every dollar earned of their Asian American counterparts  and  1 17 for every dollar earned by Hispanic men  97  100  103  On the other hand by 2006  among American women with post secondary education  African American women have made significant advances  the median income of African American women was more than those of their Asian   European  and Hispanic American counterparts with at least some college education  98  99  104  African Americans are still underrepresented in government and employment  In 1999  the median income of African American families was  33 255 compared to  53 356 of European Americans  In times of economic hardship for the nation  African Americans suffer disproportionately from job loss and underemployment  with the black underclass being hardest hit  The phrase  last hired and first fired  is reflected in the Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment figures  Nationwide  the October 2008 unemployment rate for African Americans was 11 1   105  while the nationwide rate was 6 5   106  The income gap between black and white families is also significant  In 2005  employed blacks earned only 65  of the wages of whites  down from 82  in 1975  56 The New York Times reported in 2006 that in Queens  New York  the median income among African American families exceeded that of white families  which the newspaper attributed to the growth in the number of two parent black families  It noted that Queens was the only county with more than 65 000 residents where that was true  33  In 1999  the rate of births to unwed African American mothers was estimated by economist Walter E  Williams of George Mason University to be 70   107  The poverty rate among single parent black families was 39 5  in 2005  according to Williams  while it was 9 9  among married couple black families  Among white families  the comparable rates were 26 4  and 6   108  According to Forbes magazine s  wealthiest American  lists  a 2000 net worth of  800 million dollars made Oprah Winfrey the richest African American of the 20th century  by contrast  the net worth of the 20th century s richest American  Bill Gates  who is of European descent  briefly hit  100 billion in 1999  In Forbes  2007 list  Gates  net worth decreased to  59 billion while Winfrey s increased to  2 5 billion  109  making her the world s richest black person  87  110  Winfrey is also the first African American to make Business Week s annual list of America s 50 greatest philanthropists  111  BET founder Bob Johnson was also listed as a billionaire prior to an expensive divorce and as of 2009  had an estimated net worth of  550 million  112  Winfrey remains the only African American wealthy enough to rank among the country s 400 richest people  109  Some black entrepreneurs use their wealth to create new avenues for both African Americans and new opportunities for American business in general  Examples such as Tyler Perry who created new filming studios in Atlanta  Georgia which makes it possible to film movies and television shows outside of California  113  Cultural influence in the United States Further information  African American culture The King  amp  Carter Jazzing Orchestra photographed in Houston  Texas  January 1921 From their earliest presence in North America  African Americans have contributed literature  art  agricultural skills  foods  clothing styles  music  language  social and technological innovation to American culture  The cultivation and use of many agricultural products in the U S   such as yams  peanuts  rice  okra  sorghum  grits  watermelon  indigo dyes  and cotton  can be traced to African and African American influences  Notable examples include George Washington Carver  who created 300 products from peanuts  118 products from sweet potatoes  and 75 from pecans  and George Crum  who invented the potato chip in 1853  114  African American music is one of the most pervasive African American cultural influences in the United States today and is among the most dominant in mainstream popular music  Hip hop  R amp B  funk  rock and roll  soul  blues  and other contemporary American musical forms originated in black communities and evolved from other black forms of music  including blues  doo wop  barbershop  ragtime  bluegrass  jazz  and gospel music  African American derived musical forms have also influenced and been incorporated into virtually every other popular musical genre in the world  including country and techno  African American genres are the most important ethnic vernacular tradition in America  as they have developed independent of African traditions from which they arise more so than any other immigrant groups  including Europeans  make up the broadest and longest lasting range of styles in America  and have  historically  been more influential  interculturally  geographically  and economically  than other American vernacular traditions  115  African Americans have also had an important role in American dance  Bill T  Jones  a prominent modern choreographer and dancer  has included historical African American themes in his work  particularly in the piece  Last Supper at Uncle Tom s Cabin The Promised Land   Likewise  Alvin Ailey s artistic work  including his  Revelations  based on his experience growing up as an African American in the South during the 1930s  has had a significant influence on modern dance  Another form of dance  Stepping  is an African American tradition whose performance and competition has been formalized through the traditionally black fraternities and sororities at universities  116  Many African American authors have written stories  poems  and essays influenced by their experiences as African Americans  African American literature is a major genre in American literature  Famous examples include Langston Hughes  James Baldwin  Richard Wright  Zora Neale Hurston  Ralph Ellison  Nobel Prize winner Toni Morrison  and Maya Angelou  African American inventors have created many widely used devices in the world and have contributed to international innovation  Norbert Rillieux created the technique for converting sugar cane juice into white sugar crystals  Moreover  Rillieux left Louisiana in 1854 and went to France  where he spent ten years working with the Champollions deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphics from the Rosetta Stone  117  Most slave inventors were nameless  such as the slave owned by the Confederate President Jefferson Davis who designed the ship propeller used by the Confederate navy  118  Chuck Berry in  rebro  Berry is considered a pioneer of American Rock and roll B B  King is a blues guitarist and songwriter acclaimed for his expressive singing and guitar playing  By 1913 over 1 000 inventions were patented by black Americans  Among the most notable inventors were Jan Matzeliger  who developed the first machine to mass produce shoes  119  and Elijah McCoy  who invented automatic lubrication devices for steam engines  120 Granville Woods had 35 patents to improve electric railway systems  including the first system to allow moving trains to communicate  121 Garrett A  Morgan developed the first automatic traffic signal and gas mask  122  Lewis Howard Latimer invented an improvement for the incandescent light bulb  123  More recent inventors include Frederick McKinley Jones  who invented the movable refrigeration unit for food transport in trucks and trains  124  Lloyd Quarterman worked with six other black scientists on the creation of the atomic bomb  code named the Manhattan Project   125  Quarterman also helped develop the first nuclear reactor  which was used in the atomically powered submarine called the Nautilus  126  A few other notable examples include the first successful open heart surgery  performed by Dr  Daniel Hale Williams  127  and the air conditioner  patented by Frederick McKinley Jones  124  Dr  Mark Dean holds three of the original nine patents on the computer on which all PCs are based  128  More current contributors include Otis Boykin  whose inventions included several novel methods for manufacturing electrical components that found use in applications such as guided missile systems and computers  129  and Colonel Frederick Gregory  who was not only the first black astronaut pilot but the person who redesigned the cockpits for the last three space shuttles  Gregory was also on the team that pioneered the microwave instrumentation landing system  130  Political legacy Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr  remains the most prominent political leader in the American civil rights movement and perhaps the most influential African American political figure in general  African Americans have fought in every war in the history of the United States  131  The gains made by African Americans in the Civil Rights and Black Power movements not only obtained certain rights for African Americans  but changed American society in far reaching and fundamentally important ways  Prior to the 1950s  Black Americans in the South were subject to de jure discrimination  or Jim Crow  They would often be the victims of extreme cruelty and violence  sometimes resulting in deaths  by the post WWII era  African Americans became increasingly discontented with their long standing inequality  In the words of Martin Luther King  Jr   African Americans and their supporters challenged the nation to  rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed that all men are created equal      132  The Civil Rights Movement marked a sea change in American social  political  economic and civic life  It brought with it boycotts  sit ins  demonstrations  court battles  bombings and other violence  prompted worldwide media coverage and intense public debate  forged enduring civic  economic and religious alliances  and disrupted and realigned the nation s two major political parties  Over time  it has changed in fundamental ways the manner in which blacks and whites interact with and relate to one another  The movement resulted in the removal of codified  de jure racial segregation and discrimination from American life and law  and heavily influenced other groups and movements in struggles for civil rights and social equality within American society  including the Free Speech Movement  the disabled  women  Native Americans  and migrant workers  The term  African American  Political overtones Michelle Robinson Obama is the First Lady of the United States  the first African American to hold the position The term African American carries important political overtones  Earlier terms used to identify Americans of African ancestry were conferred upon the group by colonists and Americans of European ancestry  The terms were included in the wording of various laws and legal decisions which some thought were being used as tools of white supremacy and oppression  133  There developed among blacks in America a growing desire for a term of self identification of their own choosing  With the political consciousness that emerged from the political and social ferment of the late 1960s and early 1970s  blacks no longer approved of the term Negro  They believed it had suggestions of a moderate  accommodationist  even  Uncle Tom  connotation  In this period  a growing number of blacks in the United States  particularly African American youth  celebrated their blackness and their historical and cultural ties with the African continent  The Black Power movement defiantly embraced Black as a group identifier  It was a term social leaders themselves had repudiated only two decades earlier  but they proclaimed   Black is beautiful   In this same period  a smaller number of people favored Afro American  a common shortening  as is  Anglo American    However  after the decline in popularity of the  Afro  hairstyle in the late 1970s  the term fell out of use  citation needed  In the 1980s the term African American was advanced on the model of  for example  German American or Irish American to give descendents of American slaves and other American blacks who lived through the slavery era a heritage and a cultural base  133  The term was popularized in black communities around the country via word of mouth and ultimately received mainstream use after Jesse Jackson publicly used the term in front of a national audience  Subsequently  major media outlets adopted its use  133  Some such as Maulana Karenga and Owen Alik Shahadah argue African American is more appropriate because it accurately articulates geography and historical origin  Thus linking a people to a continent as oppose to an abstract color  134  Others believe the term black is inaccurate because African Americans have a variety of skin tones  citation needed  Surveys show that the majority of Black Americans have no preference for  African American  or  Black   135  although they have a slight preference for  Black  in personal settings and  African American  in more formal settings  136  Many African Americans expressed a preference for the term  as it was formed in the same way as names for others of the many ethnic groups in the nation  Some argued further that  because of the historical circumstances surrounding the capture  enslavement and systematic attempts to de Africanize blacks in the United States under chattel slavery  most African Americans are unable to trace their ancestry to a specific African nation  hence  the entire continent serves as a geographic marker  For many  African American is more than a name expressive of cultural and historical roots  The term expresses pride in Africa and a sense of kinship and solidarity with others of the African diaspora an embrace of pan

opinion  the United States government has officially classified black people  revised to black or African American in 1997  as  having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa   137  Other federal offices  such as the United States Census Bureau  adhere to the OMB standards on race in its data collection and tabulations efforts  138  In preparation for the United States 2010 Census  a marketing and outreach plan  called 2010 Census Integrated Communications Campaign Plan  ICC  recognized and defined African Americans as black people born in the United States  From the ICC perspective  African Americans are one of three groups of black people in the United States 139  The ICC plan was to reach the three groups by acknowledging that each group has its own sense of community that is based on geography and ethnicity  140  The best way to market the census process toward any of the three groups is to reach them through their own unique communication channels and not treat the entire black population of the U S  as though they are all African Americans with a single ethnic and geographical background  The U S  Department of Justice Federal Bureau of Investigation categorizes black or African American people as  A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa  through racial categories used in the UCR Program adopted from the Statistical Policy Handbook  1978  and published by the Office of Federal Statistical Policy and Standards  U S  Department of Commerce  derived from the 1977 OMB classification  141  The African American experience In her book The End of Blackness  as well as in an essay on the liberal website Salon  142  author Debra Dickerson has argued that the term  black  should refer strictly to the descendents of Africans brought to America as slaves  and not the sons and daughters of black immigrants who lack that ancestry  In her opinion  President Barack Obama  who is the son of a Kenyan immigrant  although technically African American  is not black  142  143  She makes the argument that grouping all people of African descent together regardless of their unique ancestral circumstances would inevitably deny the lingering effects of slavery within the American community of slave descendents  in addition to denying black immigrants recognition of their own unique ancestral backgrounds   Lumping us all together   Dickerson wrote   erases the significance of slavery and continuing racism while giving the appearance of progress   142  Similar viewpoints have been expressed by Stanley Crouch in a New York Daily News piece  Charles Kenzie Steele  Jr  of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference 144  and African American columnist David Ehrenstein of the LA Times who accused white liberals of flocking to blacks who were  Magic Negros   a term that refers to a black person with no past who simply appears to assist the mainstream white  as cultural protagonists drivers  agenda  145  Ehrenstein went on to say  He s there to assuage white  guilt  they feel over the role of slavery and racial segregation in American history   145  Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  who was famously mistaken for a  recent American immigrant  by French President Nicholas Sarkozy   146  said  descendants of slaves did not get much of a head start  and I think you continue to see some of the effects of that   She has also rejected an immigrant designation for African Americans and instead prefers the term  black  or  white  to denote the African and European U S  founding populations  147  Terms no longer in common use The terms mulatto and colored were widely used until the second quarter of the 20th century  when they were considered outmoded and generally gave way to the use of negro  By the 1940s  the term commonly was capitalized  Negro  but by the mid 1960s  it had acquired negative connotations  Today  in the culture of the United States  the term is considered inappropriate and is now rarely used and perceived as a pejorative  148  149   The term Negro is largely out of use among the younger black generation  but is still used by a substantial block of older black Americans  particularly in the southern U S  150  In Latin America  negro  which translates as black is the term generally used to refer and describe black people and  similarly to mulatto  it is not considered offensive at all in these regions  However  it is pronounced differently  with the e  a mid front unrounded vowel in American Spanish    ne  o   and a close mid front unrounded vowel in Brazilian Portuguese    ne  u   being closer to a sound that it is intermediate between phonemes found in English words such as pay and egg  in Spanish  or day  city and item  in Portuguese   See also African American portal Affirmative action African American art African American history African American literature African American music African American Muslims African
