the Americas Native Americans in the United States are the indigenous peoples in North America within the boundaries of the present day continental United States  parts of Alaska  and the island state of Hawaii  They are composed of numerous  distinct Native American tribes and ethnic groups  many of which survive as intact political communities  The terms used to refer to Native Americans have been controversial  According to a 1995 US Census Bureau set of home interviews  most of the respondents with an expressed preference refer to themselves as American Indians or Indians  and this term has been adopted by major newspapers and some academic groups  however  this term does not include Native Hawaiians or those Alaskan Natives  such as Aleuts  Alutiiq  Cupik  Yupik  and Inuit peoples  who are not American Indians  Since the end of the 15th century  the migration of Europeans to the Americas  and their importation of Africans as slaves  has led to centuries of conflict and adjustment between Old and New World societies  Europeans created most of the early written historical record about Native Americans after the colonists  immigration to the Americas  3  Many Native Americans lived as hunter gatherer societies and told their histories by oral traditions  In many groups  women carried out sophisticated cultivation of numerous varieties of staple crops  maize  beans and squash  The indigenous cultures were quite different from those of the agrarian  proto industrial  mostly Christian immigrants from western Eurasia  Many Native cultures were matrilineal  the people occupied lands for use of the entire community  for hunting or agriculture  Europeans at that time had patriarchal cultures and had developed concepts of individual property rights with respect to land that were extremely different  The differences in cultures between the established Native Americans and immigrant Europeans  as well as shifting alliances among different nations of each culture through the centuries  caused extensive political tension  ethnic violence and social disruption  The Native Americans suffered high fatalities from the contact with infectious Eurasian diseases  to which they had no acquired immunity  Epidemics after European contact caused the greatest loss of life for indigenous populations  Estimates of the pre Columbian population of what today constitutes the U S  vary significantly  ranging from 1 million to 18 million  4  5  After the colonies revolted against Great Britain and established the United States of America  President George Washington and Henry Knox conceived of the idea of  civilizing  Native Americans in preparation for assimilation as United States citizens  6  7  8  9  10  Assimilation  whether voluntary as with the Choctaw  11  12  or forced  became a consistent policy through American administrations  During the 19th century  the ideology of Manifest destiny became integral to the American nationalist movement  Expansion of European American populations to the west after the American Revolution resulted in increasing pressure on Native American lands  warfare between the groups  and rising tensions  In 1830  the U S  Congress passed the Indian Removal Act  authorizing the government to relocate Native Americans from their homelands within established states to lands west of the Mississippi River  accommodating European American expansion  The first European Americans to encounter the western interior tribes were generally fur traders and trappers  There were also Jesuit missionaries active in the Northern Tier  As United States expansion reached into the American West  settler and miner migrants came into increasing conflict with the Great Basin  Great Plains  and other Western tribes  These were complex nomadic cultures based on horse culture and seasonal bison hunting  They carried out strong resistance to United States incursions in the decades after the American Civil War  in a series of Indian Wars  which were frequent up until the 1890s  but continued into the 20th century  The transcontinental railroad brought more non Natives into tribal land in the west  Over time  the U S  forced a series of treaties and land cessions by the tribes  and established reservations for them in many western states  U S  agents encouraged Native Americans to adopt European style farming and similar pursuits  but European American agricultural technology of the time was inadequate for often dry reservation lands  In 1924  Native Americans who were not already U S  citizens were granted citizenship by Congress  Contemporary Native Americans have a unique relationship with the United States because they may be members of nations  tribes  or bands with sovereignty and treaty rights  Since the late 1960s  Native American activism has led to the building of cultural infrastructure and wider recognition  they have founded independent newspapers and online media  FNX  the first Native American television channel  2011   13  community schools  tribal colleges  and tribal museums and language programs  Native American studies programs in major universities  and national and state museums  Native American and Alaskan Native authors have been increasingly published  they work as academics  policymakers  doctors  and in a wide variety of occupations  Cultural activism has led to an expansion of efforts to teach and preserve indigenous languages for younger generations  Their societies and cultures flourish within a larger population of descendants of immigrants

location of the ice free corridor and specific Paleoindian sites  Clovis theory   According to the theory of the Settlement of the Americas  migrations of humans from Eurasia to the Americas took place via Beringia  a land bridge which formerly connected the two continents across what is now the Bering Strait  The number and composition of the migrations is still being debated  14  Falling sea levels created the Bering land bridge that joined Siberia to Alaska  which began about 60 000 25 000 years ago  14  15  The minimum time depth by which this migration had taken place is confirmed at 12 000 years ago  with the upper bound  or earliest period  remaining a matter of some unresolved contention  16  17  Three major migrations occurred  as traced by linguistic and genetic data  the early Paleoamericans soon spread throughout the Americas  diversifying into many hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes  18  The North American climate finally stabilized by 8000 BCE  climatic conditions were very similar to today s  19  This led to widespread migration  cultivation of crops  and subsequently a dramatic rise in population all over the Americas  The big game hunting culture  labeled as the Clovis culture  is primarily identified with its production of fluted projectile points  The culture received its name from artifacts found near Clovis  New Mexico  the first evidence of this tool complex was excavated in 1932  The Clovis culture ranged over much of North America and also appeared in South America  The culture is identified by the distinctive Clovis point  a flaked flint spear point with a notched flute  by which it was inserted into a shaft  Dating of Clovis materials has been by association with animal bones and by the use of carbon dating methods  Recent reexaminations of Clovis materials using improved carbon dating methods produced results of 11 050 and 10 800 radiocarbon years B P   roughly 9100 to 8850 BCE   Numerous Paleoindian cultures occupied North America  with some arrayed around the Great Plains and Great Lakes of the modern United States of America and Canada  as well as adjacent areas to the West and Southwest  According to the oral histories of many of the indigenous peoples of the Americas  they have been living on this continent since their genesis  described by a wide range of traditional creation stories  Other tribes have stories that recount migrations across long tracts of land and a great river  believed to be the Mississippi  20  Genetic and linguistic data connect the indigenous people of this continent with ancient northeast Asians  Archeological and linguistic data has enabled scholars to discover some of the migrations within the Americas  The Folsom Tradition was characterized by use of Folsom points as projectile tips  and activities known from kill sites  where slaughter and butchering of bison took place  Folsom tools were left behind between 9000 BCE and 8000 BCE  21  A Folsom point for a spear  Na Den  speaking peoples entered North America starting around 8000 BCE  reaching the Pacific Northwest by 5000 BCE  22  and from there migrating along the Pacific Coast and into the interior  Linguists  anthropologists and archeologists believe their ancestors comprised a separate migration into North America  later than the first Paleo Indians  They settled first around present day Queen Charlotte Islands  British Columbia  from where they migrated into Alaska and northern Canada  south along the Pacific Coast  and into the interior  They were the earliest ancestors of the Athabascan  speaking peoples  including the present day and historical Navajo and Apache  They constructed large multi family dwellings in their villages  which were used seasonally  People did not live there year round  but for the summer to hunt and fish  and to gather food supplies for the winter  23  The Oshara Tradition people lived from 5500 BCE to 600 CE  The Southwestern Archaic Tradition was centered in north central New Mexico  the San Juan Basin  the Rio Grande Valley  southern Colorado  and southeastern Utah  Since the 1990s  archeologists have explored and dated eleven Middle Archaic sites in present day Louisiana and Florida at which early cultures built complexes with multiple earthwork mounds  surprisingly  they were societies of hunter gatherers rather than the settled agriculturalists believed necessary to build such complex structures over long periods  The prime example is Watson Brake in northern Louisiana  whose 11 mound complex is dated to 3500 BCE  making it the oldest  dated site in the Americas for such complex construction  It is nearly 2 000 years older than the Poverty Point site  Construction of the mounds went on for 500 years and the site was abandoned about 2800 BCE  likely due to changing environmental conditions  24  Poverty Point culture is a Late Archaic archaeological culture that inhabited the area of the lower Mississippi Valley and surrounding Gulf Coast  The culture thrived from 2200 BCE 700 BCE  during the Late Archaic period  25  Evidence of this culture has been found at more than 100 sites  from the major complex at Poverty Point  Louisiana across a 100 mile  160 km  range to the Jaketown Site near Belzoni  Mississippi  Poverty Point is a 1 square mile  2 6 km2  complex of six major earthwork concentric rings  with additional platform mounds at the site  Artifacts show the people traded with other Native Americans located from Georgia to the Great Lakes region  This is one among numerous mound sites of complex indigenous cultures throughout the Mississippi and Ohio valleys  They were one of several succeeding cultures often described as mound builders  The Woodland period of North American pre Columbian cultures refers to the time period from roughly 1000 BCE to 1000 CE in the eastern part of North America  The term  Woodland  was coined in the 1930s and refers to prehistoric sites dated between the Archaic period and the Mississippian cultures  The Hopewell tradition is the term used to describe common aspects of the Native American culture that flourished along rivers in the northeastern and midwestern United States from 200 BCE to 500 CE  26  Cultural areas of pre Columbian North America  according to Alfred Kroeber  The Hopewell tradition was not a single culture or society  but a widely dispersed set of related populations  who were connected by a common network of trade routes  27  known as the Hopewell Exchange System  At its greatest extent  the Hopewell exchange system ran from the Southeastern United States into the southeastern Canadian shores of Lake Ontario  Within this area  societies participated in a high degree of exchange  most activity was conducted along the waterways that served as their major transportation routes  The Hopewell exchange system traded materials from all over the United States  Coles Creek culture is an archaeological culture from the Lower Mississippi valley in the southern present day United States  The period marked a significant change in the cultural history of the area  Population increased dramatically  There is strong evidence of a growing cultural and political complexity  especially by the end of the Coles Creek sequence  Although many of the classic traits of chiefdom societies were not yet manifested  by 1000 CE the formation of simple elite polities had begun  Coles Creek sites are found in Arkansas  Louisiana  Oklahoma  Mississippi  and Texas  It is considered ancestral to the Plaquemine culture  Hohokam is one of the four major prehistoric archaeological traditions of the present day American Southwest  28  Living as simple farmers  they raised corn and beans  The early Hohokam founded a series of small villages along the middle Gila River  The communities were located near good arable land  with dry farming common in the earlier years of this period  28 Wells  usually less than 10 feet  3 m  deep  were dug for domestic water supplies by 300 CE to 500 CE  28  Early Hohokam homes were constructed of branches bent in a semi circular fashion and covered with twigs and reeds  The last layer was heavily applied mud and other materials at hand  28  The Mississippian culture  which extended throughout the Ohio and Mississippi valleys and built sites throughout the Southeast  created the largest earthworks in North America north of Mexico  most notably at Cahokia  on a tributary of the Mississippi River in present day Illinois  Its 10 story Monks Mound has a larger circumference than the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan or the Great Pyramid of Egypt  The 6 square miles  16 km2  city complex was based on the culture s cosmology  it included more than 100 mounds  positioned to support their sophisticated knowledge of astronomy  and built with knowledge of varying soil types  It included a Woodhenge  whose sacred cedar poles were placed to mark the summer and winter solstices and fall and spring equinoxes  The society began building at this site about 950 CE  and reached its peak population in 1250 CE of 20 000 30 000 people  which was not equalled by any city in the present day United States until after 1800  Cahokia was a major regional chiefdom  with trade and tributary chiefdoms located in a range of areas from bordering the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico  In the sixteenth century  the earliest Spanish explorers encountered Mississippian peoples in the interior of present day North Carolina and the Southeast  Sophisticated pre Columbian sedentary societies evolved in North America  The Mississippian culture developed the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex  the name which archeologists have given to the regional stylistic similarity of artifacts  iconography  ceremonies and mythology  The rise of the complex culture was based on the people s adoption of maize agriculture  development of greater population densities  and chiefdom level complex social organization from 1200 CE to 1650 CE  29  30  Contrary to popular belief  this development appears to have had no direct links to Mesoamerica  The peoples developed an independent  sophisticated and stratified society  after the cultivation of maize allowed the accumulation of crop surpluses to support a higher density of population  This is turn led to the development of specialized skills among some of the peoples  The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples  and is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood  31  The Haudenosaunee  Iroquois League of Nations or  People of the Long House    then based in present day upstate and western New York  had a confederacy model from the mid 15th century  Some historians have suggested that it contributed to the political thinking during the development of the later United States government  Their system of affiliation was a kind of federation  different from the strong  centralized European monarchies  32  33  Leadership was restricted to a group of 50 sachem chiefs  each representing one clan within a tribe  the Oneida and Mohawk people had nine seats each  the Onondagas held fourteen  the Cayuga had ten seats  and the Seneca had eight  Representation was not based on population numbers  as the Seneca tribe greatly outnumbered the others  When a sachem chief died  his successor was chosen by the senior woman of his tribe in consultation with other female members of the clan  property and hereditary leadership were passed matrilineally  Decisions were not made through voting but through consensus decision making  with each sachem chief holding theoretical veto power  The Onondaga were the  firekeepers   responsible for raising topics to be discussed  They occupied one side of a three sided fire  the Mohawk and Seneca sat on one side of the fire  the Oneida and Cayuga sat on the third side   34  Elizabeth Tooker  an anthropologist  has said that it was unlikely the US founding fathers were inspired by the confederacy  as it bears little resemblance to the system of governance adopted in the United States  For example  it is based on inherited rather than elected leadership  selected by female members of the tribes  consensus decision making regardless of population size of the tribes  and a single group capable of bringing matters before the legislative body  34  Long distance trading did not prevent warfare and displacement among the indigenous peoples  and their oral histories tell of numerous migrations to the historic territories where Europeans encountered them  The Iroquois invaded and attacked tribes in the Ohio River area of present day Kentucky and claimed the hunting grounds  Historians have placed these events as occurring as early as the 13th century  or in the 17th century Beaver Wars  Through warfare  the Iroquois drove several tribes to migrate west to what became known as their historically traditional lands west of the Mississippi River  Tribes originating in the Ohio Valley who moved west included the Osage  Kaw  Ponca and Omaha people  By the mid 17th century  they had resettled in their historical lands in present day Kansas  Nebraska  Arkansas and Oklahoma  The Osage warred with Caddo speaking Native Americans  displacing them in turn by the mid 18th century and dominating their new historical territories  35   edit  European exploration and colonization Main articles  Age of Discovery and European colonization of the Americas Discovery of the Mississippi by William Henry Powell  1823 1879  is a Romantic depiction of de Soto s seeing the Mississippi River for the first time  It hangs in the United States Capitol rotunda  After 1492  European exploration and colonization of the Americas revolutionized how the Old and New Worlds perceived themselves  One of the first major contacts  in what would be called the American Deep South  occurred when the conquistador Juan Ponce de Le n landed in La Florida in April 1513  Ponce de Le n was later followed by other Spanish explorers  such as P nfilo de Narv ez in 1528 and Hernando de Soto in 1539  The subsequent European colonists in North America often rationalized their expansion of empire with the assumption that they were saving a barbaric  pagan world by spreading Christian civilization  36  In the Spanish colonization of the Americas  the policy of Indian Reductions resulted in the forced conversions to Catholicism of the indigenous people in northern Nueva Espa a  They had long established spiritual and religious traditions and theological beliefs  What developed during the colonial years and since has been a syncretic Catholicism that absorbed and reflected indigenous beliefs  the religion changed in New Spain   edit  Impact on native populations From the 16th through the 19th centuries  the population of Indians declined in the following ways  epidemic diseases brought from Europe  genocide and warfare 37  at the hands of European explorers and colonists  as well as between tribes  displacement from their lands  internal warfare  38 enslavement  and a high rate of intermarriage  39  40  Most mainstream scholars believe that  among the various contributing factors  epidemic disease was the overwhelming cause of the population decline of the American natives because of their lack of immunity to new diseases brought from Europe  41  42  43  With the rapid declines of some populations and continuing rivalries among their nations  Native Americans sometimes re organized to form new cultural groups  such as the Seminoles of Florida in the eighteenth century and the Mission Indians of Alta California  Estimating the number of Native Americans living in what is today the United States of America before the arrival of the European explorers and settlers has been the subject of much debate  While it is difficult to determine exactly how many Natives lived in North America before Columbus  44  estimates range from a low of 2 1 million  Ubelaker 1976  to 7 million people  Russell Thornton  to a high of 18 million  Dobyns 1983   45  A low estimate of around 1 million was first posited by the anthropologist James Mooney in the 1890s  by calculating population density of each culture area based on its carrying capacity  In 1965  the American anthropologist Henry Dobyns published studies estimating the original population to have been 10 to 12 million  By 1983  he increased his estimates to 18 million  46  He took into account the mortality rates caused by infectious diseases of European explorers and settlers  against which Native Americans had no immunity  Dobyns combined the known mortality rates of these diseases among native people with reliable population records of the 19th century  to calculate the probable size of the original populations  4  5  By 1800  the Native population of the present day United States had declined to approximately 600 000  and only 250 000 Native Americans remained in the 1890s  47  Conference between French and Indian leaders around a ceremonial fire  Chicken pox and measles  although by this time endemic and rarely fatal among Europeans  long after being introduced from Asia   often proved deadly to Native Americans  Smallpox proved particularly fatal to Native American populations  48 Epidemics often immediately followed European exploration and sometimes destroyed entire village populations  While precise figures are difficult to determine  some historians estimate that at least 30   and sometimes 50  to 70   of some Native populations died after first contact due to Eurasian smallpox  49  One element of the Columbian exchange suggests explorers from the Christopher Columbus expedition contracted syphilis from indigenous peoples and carried it back to Europe  where it spread widely  50  Other researchers believe that the disease existed in Europe and Asia before Columbus and his men returned from exposure to indigenous peoples of the Americas  but that they brought back a more virulent form  In 1618 1619  smallpox killed 90  of the Native Americans in the area of the Massachusetts Bay  51  Historians believe many Mohawk in present day New York became infected after contact with children of Dutch traders in Albany in 1634  The disease swept through Mohawk villages  reaching the Onondaga at Lake Ontario by 1636  and the lands of the western Iroquois by 1679  as it was carried by Mohawk and other Native Americans who traveled the trading routes  52  The high rate of fatalities caused breakdowns in Native American societies and disrupted generational exchanges of culture  Between 1754 and 1763  many Native American tribes were involved in the French and Indian War Seven Years War  Those involved in the fur trade in the northern areas tended to ally with French forces against British colonial militias  Native Americans fought on both sides of the conflict  The greater number of tribes fought with the French in the hopes of checking British expansion  The British had made fewer allies  but it was joined by some tribes that wanted to prove assimilation and loyalty in support of treaties to preserve their territories  They were often disappointed when such treaties were later overturned  The tribes had their own purposes  using their alliances with the European powers to battle traditional Native enemies  Native California Population  according to Cook 1978  After European explorers reached the West Coast in the 1770s  smallpox rapidly killed at least 30  of Northwest Coast Native Americans  For the next 80 to 100 years  smallpox and other diseases devastated native populations in the region  53 Puget Sound area populations  once estimated as high as 37 000 people  were reduced to only 9 000 survivors by the time settlers arrived en masse in the mid 19th century  54  The e Spanish missions in California did not significantly affect the population of Native Americans  but the numbers of the latter decreased rapidly after California ceased to be a Spanish colony  especially during the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th  see chart on the right   Smallpox epidemics in 1780 1782 and 1837 1838 brought devastation and drastic depopulation among the Plains Indians  55  56  By 1832  the federal government established a smallpox vaccination program for Native Americans  The Indian Vaccination Act of 1832   It was the first federal program created to address a health problem of Native Americans  57  58   edit  Animal introductions With the meeting of two worlds  animals  insects  and plants were carried from one to the other  both deliberately and by chance  in what is called the Columbian Exchange  Sheep  pigs  and cattle were all Old World animals that were introduced to contemporary Native Americans who never knew such animals  59  In the 16th century  Spaniards and other Europeans brought horses to the Americas  citation needed  The early American horse had been game for the earliest humans on the continent  It was hunted to extinction about 7000 BCE  just after the end of the last glacial period  citation needed  Native Americans benefited by reintroduction of horses  As they adopted use of the animals  they began to change their cultures in substantial ways  especially by extending their nomadic ranges for hunting  Some of the horses escaped and began to breed and increase their numbers in the wild  The reintroduction of the horse to North America had a profound impact on Native American culture of the Great Plains  The tribes trained and used horses to ride and to carry packs or pull travois  The people fully incorporated the use of horses into their societies and expanded their territories  They used horses to carry goods for exchange with neighboring tribes  to hunt game  especially bison  and to conduct wars and horse raids   edit  King Philip s War King Philip s War sometimes called Metacom s War or Metacom s Rebellion  was an armed conflict between Native American inhabitants of present day southern New England and English colonists and their Native American allies from 1675 1676  It continued in northern New England  primarily on the Maine frontier  even after King Philip was killed  until a treaty was signed

joining with the Abanaki Tribes and Wabanaki Federation  citation needed   edit  European enslavement When Europeans arrived as colonists in North America  Native Americans changed their practice of slavery dramatically  Native Americans began selling war captives to whites rather than integrating them into their own societies as they had done before  As the demand for labor in the West Indies grew with the cultivation of sugar cane  Europeans enslaved Native Americans for the Thirteen Colonies  and some were exported to the  sugar islands   The British settlers  especially those in the southern colonies  purchased or captured Native Americans to use as forced labor in cultivating tobacco  rice  and indigo  Accurate records of the numbers enslaved do not exist  Scholars estimate tens of thousands of Native Americans may have been enslaved by the Europeans  being sold by Native Americans themselves  Slavery became a caste of people who were foreign to the English  Native Americans  Africans and their descendants  and non Christians  The Virginia General Assembly defined some terms of slavery in 1705  All servants imported and brought into the Country    who were not Christians in their native Country    shall be accounted and be slaves  All Negro  mulatto and Indian slaves within this dominion     shall be held to be real estate  If any slave resists his master     correcting such slave  and shall happen to be killed in such correction     the master shall be free of all punishment     as if such accident never happened   Virginia General Assembly declaration  1705 61  The slave trade of Native Americans lasted only until around 1730  It gave rise to a series of devastating wars among the tribes  including the Yamasee War  The Indian Wars of the early 18th century  combined with the increasing importation of African slaves  effectively ended the Native American slave trade by 1750  Colonists found that Native American slaves could easily escape  as they knew the country  The wars cost the lives of numerous colonial slave traders and disrupted their early societies  The remaining Native American groups banded together to face the Europeans from a position of strength  Many surviving Native American peoples of the southeast strengthened their loose coalitions of language groups and joined confederacies such as the Choctaw  the Creek  and the Catawba for protection  Native American women were at risk for rape whether they were enslaved or not  during the early colonial years  settlers were disproportionately male  They turned to Native women for sexual relationships  62  Both Native American and African enslaved women suffered rape and sexual harassment by male slaveholders and other white men  62   edit  Native American slavery Further information  Slavery among Native Americans in the United States and Slavery among Indigenous peoples of the Americas  edit  Traditions of Native American slavery The majority of Native American tribes did practice some form of slavery before the European introduction of African slavery into North America  but none exploited slave labor on a large scale  In addition  Native Americans did not buy and sell captives in the pre colonial era  although they sometimes exchanged enslaved individuals with other tribes in peace gestures or in exchange for their own members  63  The conditions of enslaved Native Americans varied among the tribes  In many cases  young enslaved captives were adopted into the tribes to replace warriors killed during warfare or by disease  Other tribes practiced debt slavery or imposed slavery on tribal members who had committed crimes  but  this status was only temporary as the enslaved worked off their obligations to the tribal society  63  Among some Pacific Northwest tribes  about a quarter of the population were slaves  64  Other slave owning tribes of North America were  for example  Comanche of Texas  Creek of Georgia  the Pawnee  and Klamath  65   edit  Native American adoption of African slavery Native Americans interacted with enslaved Africans and African Americans on many levels  Over time all the cultures interacted  Native Americans began slowly to adopt white culture  66  Native Americans in the South shared some experiences with Africans  especially during the period  primarily in the 17th century  when both were enslaved  The colonists along the Atlantic Coast had begun enslaving Native Americans to ensure a source of labor  At one time the slave trade was so extensive that it caused increasing tensions with the various Algonquian tribes  as well as the Iroquois  Based in New York and Pennsylvania  they had threatened to attack colonists on behalf of the related Iroquoian Tuscarora before they migrated out of the South in the early 1700s  67  In the 1790s  Benjamin Hawkins was assigned as the US agent to the southeastern tribes  who became known as the Five Civilized Tribes for their adoption of numerous Anglo European practices  He advised the tribes to take up slaveholding to aid them in European style farming and plantations  He thought their traditional form of slavery  which had looser conditions  was less efficient than chattel slavery  68  In the nineteenth century  some members of these tribes who were more closely associated with settlers  began to purchase African American slaves for workers  They adopted some European American ways to benefit their people  The writer William Loren Katz contends that Native Americans treated their slaves better than did the typical European American in the Deep South  69  Though less than 3  of Native Americans owned slaves  bondage created destructive cleavages among those who were slaveholders  Among the Five Civilized Tribes  mixed race slaveholders were generally part of an elite hierarchy  often based on their mothers  clan status  as the societies had matrilineal systems  As did Benjamin Hawkins  European fur traders and colonial officials tended to marry high status women  in strategic alliances seen to benefit both sides  The Choctaw  Creek and Cherokee believed they benefited from stronger alliances

The chiefs of the tribes believed that some of the new generation of mixed race  bilingual chiefs would lead their people into the future and be better able to adapt to new conditions influenced by European Americans  69  Proposals for Indian Removal heightened the tensions of cultural changes  due to the increase in the number of mixed race Native Americans in the South  Full bloods  who tended to live in areas less affected by colonial encroachment  generally worked to maintain traditional ways  including control of communal lands  While the traditional members often resented the sale of tribal lands to Anglo Americans  by the 1830s they agreed it was not possible to go to war with the colonists on this issue   edit  Foundations for freedom Further information  Great Law of Peace The Treaty of Penn with the Indians by Benjamin West painted in 1771 Some Europeans considered Native American societies to be representative of a golden age known to them only in folk history  70  The political theorist Jean Jacques Rousseau wrote that the idea of freedom and democratic ideals was born in the Americas because  it was only in America  that Europeans from 1500 to 1776 knew of societies that were  truly free   70  Natural freedom is the only object of the policy of the  Native Americans   with this freedom do nature and climate rule alone amongst them      Native Americans

twentieth century  some writers have credited the Iroquois nations  political confederacy and democratic government as being influences for the development of the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution  71  72  In October 1988  the U S  Congress passed Concurrent Resolution 331 to recognize the influence of the Iroquois Constitution upon the U S  Constitution and Bill of Rights  73  But  leading historians of the period note that historic evidence is lacking to support such an interpretation  Gordon Wood wrote   The English colonists did not need the Indians to tell them about federalism or self government  The New England Confederation was organized as early as 1643   74  The historian Jack Rakove  a specialist in early American history  in 2005 noted that the

Yamacraw Creek Native Americans meet with the Trustee of the colony of Georgia in England  July 1734  The painting shows a Native American boy  in a blue coat  and woman  in a red dress  in European clothing  During the American Revolution  the newly proclaimed United States competed with the British for the allegiance of Native American nations east of the Mississippi River  Most Native Americans who joined the struggle sided with the British  based both on their trading relationships and hopes that colonial defeat would result in a halt to further colonial expansion onto Native American land  Many native communities were divided over which side to support in the war and others wanted to remain neutral  The first native community to sign a treaty with the new United States Government was the Lenape  For the Iroquois Confederacy  based in New York  the American Revolution resulted in civil war  The only Iroquois tribes to ally with the colonials were the Oneida and Tuscarora  Frontier warfare during the American Revolution was particularly brutal  and numerous atrocities were committed by settlers and native tribes alike  Noncombatants suffered greatly during the war  Military expeditions on each side destroyed villages and food supplies to reduce the ability of people to fight  as in frequent raids by both sides in the Mohawk Valley and western New York  75  The largest of these expeditions was the Sullivan Expedition of 1779  in which American colonial troops destroyed more than 40 Iroquois villages to neutralize Iroquois raids in upstate New York  The expedition failed to have the desired effect  Native American activity became even more determined  American Indians have played a central role in shaping the history of the nation  and they are deeply woven into the social fabric of much of American life     During the last three decades of the twentieth century  scholars of ethnohistory  of the  new Indian history   and of Native American studies forcefully demonstrated that to understand American history and the American experience  one must include American Indians   Robbie Ethridge  Creek Country  76  Bronze medals struck at behest

Treaty of Paris  1783   through which they ceded vast Native American territories to the United States without informing or consulting with the Native Americans  The Northwest Indian War was led by Native American tribes trying to repulse American settlers  The United States initially treated the Native Americans who had fought as allies with the British as a conquered people who had lost their lands  Although most members of the Iroquois tribes went to Canada with the Loyalists  others tried to stay in New York and western territories to maintain their lands  The state of New York made a separate treaty with Iroquois nations and put up for sale 5 000 000 acres  20 000 km2  of land that had previously been their territories  The state established small reservations in western New York for the remnant peoples  The Indians presented a reverse image of European civilization which helped America establish a national identity that was neither savage nor civilized   Charles Sanford  The Quest for Paradise 77   edit  18th century United States The United States was eager to expand  to develop farming and settlements in new areas  and to satisfy land hunger of settlers from New England and new immigrants  The national government initially sought to purchase Native American land by treaties  The states and settlers were frequently at odds with this policy  78  George Washington advocated the advancement of Native American society and he  harbored some measure of goodwill towards the Indians   79  European nations sent Native Americans  sometimes against their will  to the Old World as objects of curiosity  They often entertained royalty and were sometimes prey to commercial purposes  Christianization of Native Americans was a charted purpose for some European colonies  Whereas it hath at this time become peculiarly necessary to warn the citizens of the United States against a violation of the treaties     I do by these presents require  all officers of the United States  as well civil as military  and all other citizens and inhabitants thereof  to govern themselves according to the treaties and act aforesaid  as they will answer the contrary at their peril   George Washington  Proclamation Regarding Treaties  1790  80  United States policy toward Native Americans had continued to evolve after the American Revolution  George Washington and Henry Knox believed that Native Americans were equals but that their society was inferior  Washington formulated a policy to encourage the  civilizing  process  7  Washington had a six point plan for civilization which included  1  impartial justice toward Native Americans 2  regulated buying of Native American lands 3  promotion of commerce 4  promotion of experiments to civilize or improve Native American society 5  presidential authority to give presents 6  punishing those who violated Native American rights  9  Robert Remini  a historian  wrote that  once the Indians adopted the practice of private property  built homes  farmed  educated their children  and embraced Christianity  these Native Americans would win acceptance from white Americans   8  The United States appointed agents  like Benjamin Hawkins  to live among the Native Americans and to teach them how to live like whites  6  How different would be the sensation of a philosophic mind to reflect that instead of exterminating a part of the human race by our modes of population that we had persevered through all difficulties and at last had imparted our Knowledge of cultivating and the arts  to the Aboriginals of the Country by which the source of future life and happiness had been preserved and extended  But it has been conceived to be impracticable to civilize the Indians of North America   This opinion is probably more convenient than just   Henry Knox to George Washington  1790s  79  In the late 18th century  reformers starting with Washington and Knox  81  supported educating native children and adults  in efforts to  civilize  or otherwise assimilate Native Americans to the larger society  as opposed to relegating them to reservations   The Civilization Fund Act of 1819 promoted this civilization policy by providing funding to societies  mostly religious  who worked on Native American improvement  I rejoice  brothers  to hear you propose to become cultivators of the earth for the

expansion Native Americans flee from the allegorical representation of Manifest Destiny  Columbia  painted in 1872 by John Gast In July 1845  the New York newspaper editor John L  O Sullivan coined the phrase   Manifest Destiny   as the  design of Providence  supporting the territorial expansion of the United States  87 Manifest Destiny had serious consequences for Native Americans  since continental expansion for the United States took place at the cost of their occupied land  Manifest Destiny was a justification for expansion and westward movement  or  in some interpretations  an ideology or doctrine that helped to promote the process of civilization  Advocates of Manifest Destiny believed that expansion was not only good  but that it was obvious and certain  The term was first used primarily by Jacksonian Democrats in the 1840s to promote the annexation of much of what is now the Western United States  the Oregon Territory  the Texas Annexation  and the Mexican Cession   What a prodigious growth this English race  especially the American branch of it  is having  How soon will it subdue and occupy all the wild parts of this continent and of the islands

American attire  Photos date from 1868 to 1924  In the 19th century  the incessant westward expansion of the United States incrementally compelled large numbers of Native Americans to resettle further west  often by force  almost always reluctantly  Native Americans believed this forced relocation illegal  given the Hopewell Treaty of 1785  Under President Andrew Jackson  United States Congress passed the Indian Removal Act of 1830  which authorized the President to conduct treaties to exchange Native American land east of the Mississippi River for lands west of the river   As many as 100 000 Native Americans relocated to the West as a result of this Indian Removal policy  In theory  relocation was supposed to be voluntary and many Native Americans did remain in the East  In practice  great pressure was put on Native American leaders to sign removal treaties  The most egregious violation of the stated intention of the removal policy took place under the Treaty of New Echota  which was signed by a dissident faction of Cherokees but not the principal chief  The following year  the Cherokee conceded to removal  but Georgia included their land in a lottery for European American settlement before that  President Jackson used the military to gather and transport the Cherokee to the west  whose timing and lack of adequate supplies led to the deaths of an estimated 4 000 Cherokees on the Trail of Tears  About 17 000 Cherokees  along with approximately 2 000 enslaved blacks held by Cherokees  were taken by force migration to Indian Territory  93  Tribes were generally located to reservations where they could more easily be separated from traditional life and pushed into European American society  Some southern states additionally enacted laws in the 19th century forbidding non Native American settlement on Native American lands  with the intention to prevent sympathetic white missionaries from aiding the scattered Native American resistance  94  The earliest recorded date of Native Americans  becoming U S  citizens was in 1831 when the Mississippi Choctaw became citizens after the United States Legislature ratified the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek  12

initially run primarily by or affiliated with Christian missionaries  101  At this time American society thought that Native American children needed to be acculturated to the general society  The boarding school experience often proved traumatic to Native American children  who were forbidden to speak their native languages  taught Christianity and denied the right to practice their native religions  and in numerous other ways forced to abandon their Native American identities 102  and adopt European American culture  Since the twentieth century  investigations documented cases of sexual  physical and mental abuse occurring at such schools  103  104  While problems were documented as early as the 1920s  some of the schools continued into the 1960s  Since the rise of self determination for Native Americans  they have generally emphasized education of their children at schools near where they live  In addition  many federally recognized tribes have taken over operations of such schools and added programs of language retention and revival to strengthen their cultures  Beginning in the 1970s  tribes have also founded colleges at their reservations  controlled and operated by Native Americans  to educate their young for jobs as well as to pass on their cultures   edit  20th century Charles Curtis  of Kaw  Osage  Potawatomi  French and British ancestry  was 31st

military during World War II  at the time  one third of all able bodied Indian men from 18 to 50 years of age  107  Described as the first large scale exodus of indigenous peoples from the reservations since the removals of the 19th century  the men s service with the US military in the international conflict was a turning point in Native American history  The overwhelming majority of Native Americans welcomed the opportunity to serve  they had a voluntary enlistment rate that was 40  higher than those drafted  War Department officials said that if the entire population had enlisted in the same proportion as the Native Americans  the response would have rendered the draft unnecessary  108  Their fellow soldiers often held them in high esteem  in part since the legend of the tough Native American warrior had become a part of the fabric of American historical legend  White servicemen sometimes showed a lighthearted respect toward Native American comrades by calling them  chief   The resulting increase in contact with the world outside of the reservation system brought profound changes to Native American culture   The war   said the U S  Indian Commissioner in 1945   caused the greatest disruption of Native life since the beginning of the reservation era   affecting the habits  views  and economic well being of tribal members  109  The most significant of these changes was the opportunity as a result of wartime labor shortages to find well paying work in cities  and many people relocated to urban areas  particularly on the West Coast with the buildup of the defense industry  There were also losses as a result of the war  For instance  a total of 1 200 Pueblo men served in World War II  only about half came home alive  In addition many more Navajo served as code talkers for the military in the Pacific  The code they made  although cryptologically very simple  was never cracked by the Japanese   edit  Self determination Main articles  Native American self determination and Native American civil rights Military service and urban residency contributed to the rise of American Indian activism  particularly after the 1960s and the occupation of Alcatraz Island  1969 1971  by a student Indian group from San Francisco  In the same period  the American Indian Movement  AIM  was founded in Minneapolis  and chapters were established throughout the country  where American Indians combined spiritual and political activism  Political protests gained national media attention and the sympathy of the American public  Through the mid 1970s  conflicts between governments and Native Americans occasionally erupted into violence  A notable late 20th century event was the Wounded Knee incident on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation  Upset with tribal government and the failures of the federal government to enforce treaty rights  about 300 Oglala Lakota and American Indian Movement  AIM  activists took control of Wounded Knee on February 27  1973  Indian activists from around the country joined them at Pine Ridge  and the occupation became a symbol of rising American Indian identity and power  Federal law enforcement officials and the national guard cordoned off the town  and the two sides had a standoff for 71 days  During much gunfire  one United States Marshal was wounded and paralyzed  In late April a Cherokee and local Lakota man were killed by gunfire  the Lakota elders ended the occupation to ensure no more lives were lost  110  In June 1975  two FBI agents seeking to make an armed robbery arrest at Pine Ridge Reservation were wounded in a firefight  and killed at close range  The AIM activist Leonard Peltier was sentenced in 1976 to two consecutive terms of life in prison in the FBI deaths  111  In 1975 the US Congress passed the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act  marking the culmination of 15 years of policy changes  It resulted from American Indian activism  the Civil Rights Movement  and community development aspects of President Lyndon Johnson s social programs of the 1960s  The Act recognized the right and need of Native Americans for self determination  It marked the U S  government s turn away from the 1950s policy of termination of the relationship between tribes and the government  The U S  government encouraged Native Americans  efforts at self government and determining their futures  Tribes have developed organizations to administer their own social  welfare and housing programs  for instance  By this time  tribes had already started to establish community schools to replace the BIA boarding schools  Led by the Navajo Nation in 1968  tribes started tribal colleges and universities  to build their own models of education on reservations  preserve and revive their cultures  and develop educated workforces  In 1994 the US Congress passed legislation recognizing the tribal colleges as land grant colleges  which provided opportunities for funding  Thirty two tribal colleges in the US belong to the American Indian Higher Education Consortium  By the early 21st century  tribal nations had also established numerous language revival programs in their schools  In addition  Native American activism has led major universities across the country to establish Native American studies programs and departments  increasing awareness of the strengths of Indian cultures  providing opportunities for academics  and deepening research on history and cultures in the United States  Native Americans have entered academia  journalism and media  politics at local  state and federal levels  and public service  for instance  influencing medical research and policy to identify issues related to American Indians  In 1981  Tim Giago founded the Lakota Times  an independent Native American newspaper  located at the Pine Ridge Reservation but not controlled by tribal government  He later founded the Native American Journalists Association  Other independent newspapers and media corporations have been developed  so that Native American journalists are contributing perspective on their own affairs and other policies and events  In 2004  Senator Sam Brownback  Republican of Kansas  introduced a joint resolution  Senate Joint Resolution 37  to  offer an apology to all Native Peoples on behalf of the United States  for past  ill conceived policies  by the US government regarding Indian Tribes  112  President Barack Obama signed the historic apology into law in 2009  as section Section 8113 of the 2010 defense appropriations

government indicted suspects in the December 1975 murder of Anna Mae Aquash at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation  A Mi qmaq  Aquash was the highest ranking woman activist in the American Indian Movement  AIM  at the time  She was killed several months after two FBI agents had been killed at the reservation  Many Lakota believe that she was killed by AIM on suspicion of having been an FBI informant  but she never worked for the FBI  114  Arlo Looking Cloud was convicted in federal court in 2004  In 2007  the US extradited AIM activist John Graham from Canada to stand trial for her murder  115  He was also convicted and sentenced to life   edit  International indigenous rights Activists around the world have been working on organizing for indigenous rights  On September 13  2007 the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  after nearly 25 years of discussion  Indigenous representatives from the United States  particularly from AIM  played a key role in the development of this Declaration  as did indigenous peoples from the Americas and other nations  It was passed with an overwhelming majority of 143 votes in favor  only Canada  Australia  New Zealand  and the United States voted against it  Each of these four nations has indigenous populations that became outnumbered  disfranchised and historically oppressed by new immigrant groups  116  They expressed serious reservations about the final text of the Declaration as placed before the General Assembly  Australia and New Zealand have since then changed their vote in favor of the Declaration  The U S  mission issued a floor document   Observations of the United States with respect to the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples   setting out its objections to the Declaration  The United States drew attention to the Declaration s failure to provide a clear definition of exactly whom the term  indigenous peoples  is intended to cover  117  A change in political administrations has resulted in US support for the document  In December 2010  President Obama declared that the United States would sign the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  118   edit  Current legal status Main articles  Tribal sovereignty in the United States and Native American tribe There are 562 federally recognized tribal governments in the United States  These tribes possess the right to form their own governments  to enforce laws  both civil and criminal  within their lands  to tax  to establish requirements for membership  to license and regulate activities  to zone and to exclude persons from tribal territories  Limitations on tribal powers of self government include the same limitations applicable to states  for example  neither tribes nor states have the power to make war  engage in foreign relations  or coin money  this includes paper currency   119  Many Native Americans and advocates of Native American rights point out that the U S  federal government s claim to recognize the  sovereignty  of Native American peoples falls short  given that the U S  wishes to govern Native American peoples and treat them as subject to U S  law  Such advocates contend that full respect for Native American sovereignty would require the US government to deal with Native American peoples in the same manner as any other sovereign nation  handling matters related to relations with Native Americans through the Secretary of State  rather than the Bureau of Indian Affairs  The Bureau of Indian Affairs reports on its website that its  responsibility is the administration and management of 55 700 000 acres  225 000 km2  of land held in trust by the United States for American Indians  Indian tribes  and Alaska Natives   120  Many Native Americans and advocates of Native American rights believe that it is condescending for such lands to be considered  held in trust  and regulated in any fashion by other than their own tribes  whether the U S  or Canadian governments  or any other non Native American authority  As of 2000  the largest tribes in the U S  by population were Navajo  Cherokee  Choctaw  Sioux  Chippewa  Apache  Blackfeet  Iroquois  and Pueblo  In 2000  eight of ten Americans with Native American ancestry were of mixed ancestry  It is estimated that by 2100 that figure will rise to nine out of ten  121  In addition  there are a number of tribes that are recognized by individual states  but not by the federal government  The rights and benefits associated with state recognition vary from state to state  Some tribal nations have been unable to document the cultural continuity required for federal recognition  The Muwekma Ohlone of the San Francisco bay area are pursuing litigation in the federal court system to establish recognition  122  Many of the smaller eastern tribes  long considered remnants of extinct peoples  have been trying to gain official recognition of their tribal status  Several in Virginia and North Carolina have gained state recognition  Federal recognition confers some benefits  including the right to label arts and crafts as Native American and permission to apply for grants that are specifically reserved for Native Americans  But gaining federal recognition as a tribe is extremely difficult  to be established as a tribal group  members have to submit extensive genealogical proof of tribal descent and continuity of the tribe as a culture  Native peoples are concerned about the effects of abandoned uranium mines on or near their lands  In July 2000 the Washington Republican Party adopted a resolution recommending that the federal and legislative branches of the U S  government terminate tribal governments  123  In 2007 a group of Democratic Party congressmen and congresswomen introduced a bill in the U S  House of Representatives to  terminate  the Cherokee Nation  124  This was related to their voting to exclude Cherokee Freedmen as members of the tribe unless they had a Cherokee ancestor on the Dawes Rolls  although all Cherokee Freedmen and their descendants had been members since 1866  As of 2004  various Native Americans are wary of attempts by others to gain control of their reservation lands for natural resources  such as coal and uranium in the West  125  126  127  In the state of Virginia  Native Americans face a unique problem  Virginia has no federally recognized tribes but the state has recognized eight  This is related historically to the greater impact of disease and warfare on the Virginia Indian populations  as well as their intermarriage with Europeans and Africans  Some people confused the ancestry with culture  but groups of Virginia Indians maintained their cultural continuity  Most of their early reservations were ended under the pressure of early European settlement  Some historians also note the problems of Virginia Indians in establishing documented continuity of identity  due to the work of Walter Ashby Plecker  1912 1946   As registrar of the state s Bureau of Vital Statistics  he applied his own interpretation of the one drop rule  enacted in law in 1924 as the state s Racial Integrity Act  It recognized only two races   white  and  colored   Plecker  a segregationist  believed that the state s Native Americans had been  mongrelized  by intermarriage with African Americans  to him  ancestry determined identity  rather than culture  He thought that some people of partial black ancestry were trying to  pass  as Native Americans  Plecker thought that anyone with any African heritage had to be classified as colored  regardless of appearance  amount of European or Native American ancestry  and cultural community identification  Plecker pressured local governments into reclassifying all Native Americans in the state as  colored   and gave them lists of family surnames to examine for reclassification based on his interpretation of data and the law  This led to the state s destruction of accurate records related to families and communities who identified as Native American  as in church records and daily life   By his actions  sometimes different members of the same family were split by being classified as  white  or  colored   He did not allow people to enter their primary identification as Native American in state records  128  In 2009  the Senate Indian Affairs Committee endorsed a bill that would grant federal recognition to tribes in Virginia  129  To achieve federal recognition and its benefits  tribes must prove continuous existence since 1900  The federal government has maintained this requirement  in part because through participation on councils and committees  federally recognized tribes have been adamant about groups  satisfying the same requirements as they did  128   edit  Contemporary issues Portrait of Native Americans from various bands  tribes  and nations from across  Indian country   Poldine Carlo  Koyukon

related to nutrition and health practices  The community suffers a vulnerability to and disproportionately high rate of alcoholism  131  Numerous tribal governments have long prohibited the sale of alcohol on reservations  but generally it is readily for sale in nearby border towns  In addition to increasing numbers of American Indians entering the fields of community health and medicine  agencies working with Native American communities have sought partnerships  representatives of policy and program boards  and other ways to learn and respect their traditions and integrate the benefits of Western medicine within their own cultural practices   It has long been recognized that Native Americans are dying of diabetes  alcoholism  tuberculosis  suicide  and other health conditions at shocking rates  Beyond disturbingly high mortality rates  Native Americans also suffer a significantly lower health status and disproportionate rates of disease compared with all other Americans     The U S  Commission on Civil Rights  September 2004 132  This Census Bureau map depicts the locations of Native Americans in the United States as of 2000  In the early 21st century  Native American communities have exhibited continuing growth and revival  playing a larger role in the American economy  and in the lives of Native Americans  Communities have consistently formed governments that administer services such as firefighting  natural resource management  social programs  housing and law enforcement  Most Native American communities have established court systems to adjudicate matters related to local ordinances  and most also look to various forms of moral and social authority  such as forms of restorative justice  vested in the traditional culture of the tribal nation  To address the housing needs of Native Americans  Congress passed the Native American Housing and Self Determination Act  NAHASDA  in 1996  This legislation replaced public housing built by the BIA  and other 1937 Housing Act programs directed towards Indian Housing Authorities  with a block grant program providing funds to be administered by the Tribes to develop their own housing

Milne Calder  installed on the Philadelphia City Hall  Native Americans have been depicted by American artists in various ways at different historical periods  During the 16th century  the artist John White made watercolors and engravings of the people native to the southeastern states  John White s images were  for the most part  faithful likenesses of the people he observed  The artist Theodore de Bry used White s original watercolors to make a book of engravings entitled  A briefe and true report of the new found land of Virginia  In his book  de Bry often altered the poses and features of White s figures to make them appear more European  During the period when White and de Bry were working  when Europeans were first coming into contact with Native Americans  Europeans were greatly interested in native American cultures  Their curiosity created demand for a book like de Bry s  A number of 19th and 20th century United States and Canadian painters  often motivated by a desire to document and preserve Native culture  specialized in Native American subjects  Among the most prominent of these were Elbridge Ayer Burbank  George Catlin  Seth Eastman  Paul Kane  W  Langdon Kihn  Charles Bird King  Joseph Henry Sharp  and John Mix Stanley  During the construction of the Capitol building in the early 19th century  the U S  government commissioned a series of four relief panels to crown the doorway of the Rotunda  The reliefs encapsulate a vision of European Native American relations that had assumed mythic historical proportions by the 19th century  The four panels depict  The Preservation of Captain Smith by Pocahontas  1825  by Antonio Capellano  The Landing of the Pilgrims  1825  and The Conflict of Daniel Boone and the Indians  1826 27  by Enrico Causici  and William Penn s Treaty with the Indians  1827  by Nicholas Gevelot  The reliefs by European sculptors present versions of the Europeans and the Native Americans  in which the Europeans appear refined and the natives appear ferocious  The Whig representative of Virginia  Henry A  Wise  wrote about how Native Americans might think of the reliefs   We give you corn  you cheat us of our lands  we save your life  you take ours   While many 19th century images of Native Americans conveyed similarly negative messages  artists such as Charles Bird King sought to express a more balanced image of Native Americans  During this time  some fiction writers were informed about and sympathetic to Native American culture  Marah Ellis Ryan conveyed the culture with sympathy  In the 20th century  early portrayals of Native Americans in movies and television roles were first performed by European Americans dressed in mock traditional attire  Examples included The Last of the Mohicans  1920   Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans  1957   and F Troop  1965 67   In later decades  Native American actors such as Jay Silverheels in The Lone Ranger television series  1949 57  came to prominence  Roles of Native Americans were limited and not reflective of Native American culture  By the 1970s some Native American film roles began to show more complexity  such as those in Little Big Man  1970   Billy Jack  1971   and The Outlaw Josey Wales  1976   which depicted Native Americans in minor supporting roles  For years  Native people on U S  television were relegated to secondary  subordinate roles  During the years of the series Bonanza  1959 1973   no major or secondary Native characters appeared on a consistent basis  The series The Lone Ranger  1949 1957   Cheyenne  1957 1963   and Law of the Plainsman  1959 1963  had Native characters who were essentially aides to the central white characters  This continued in such series as How the West Was Won  These programs resembled the  sympathetic  yet contradictory film Dances With Wolves of 1990  in which  according to Ella Shohat and Robert Stam  the narrative choice was to relate the Lakota story as told through a Euro American voice  for wider impact among a general audience  141  Like the 1992 remake of The Last of the Mohicans and Geronimo  An American Legend  1993   Dances with Wolves employed a number of Native American actors  and made an effort to portray Indigenous languages  In 2004  Co Producer Guy Perrotta presented the film Mystic Voices  The Story of the Pequot War  2004   a television documentary on the first major war between colonists and Native peoples in the Americas  Perrotta and Charles Clemmons intended to increase public understanding of the significance of this early event  They believed it had significance not only for northeastern Native Peoples and descendants of English and Dutch colonists  but for all Americans today  Wanting to make the film historically accurate and unbiased  the producers invited a broadly based Advisory Board  and used scholars  Native Americans  and descendants of the colonists to help tell the story  They elicited personal and often passionate viewpoints from contemporary Americans  The production portrayed the conflict as a struggle between different value systems  which included not only the Pequot  but a number of other Native American tribes  most of which allied with the English  It presents facts and seeks to help viewers better understand the several peoples who fought the War  In 2009  We Shall Remain  2009   a television documentary by Ric Burns and part of the American Experience series  presented a five episode series  from a Native American perspective   It represented  an unprecedented collaboration between Native and non Native filmmakers and involves Native advisors and scholars at all levels of the project   142  The five episodes explore the impact of King Philip s War on the northeastern tribes  the  Native American confederacy  of Tecumseh s War  the US forced relocation of Southeastern tribes known as the Trail of Tears  the pursuit and capture of Geronimo and the Apache Wars  and concludes with the Wounded Knee incident  participation by the American Indian Movement  and the increasing resurgence of modern Native cultures since   edit  Terminology differences Further information  Native American name

Aboriginal Americans  Amerindians  Amerinds  Colored  90  143  First Americans  Native Indians  Indigenous  Original Americans  Red Indians  Redskins or Red Men  The term Native American was introduced in the United States by academics in preference to the older term Indian to distinguish the indigenous peoples of the Americas from the people of India  and to avoid negative stereotypes associated with the term Indian  Some academics believe that Indians should be considered as outdated or offensive  Many indigenous Americans  however  prefer the term American Indian  Others point out that anyone born in the United States is  technically  native to America  In this sense  native was substituted for indigenous  Today  people from India  and their descendants  who are citizens of the United States are called Indian Americans or Asian Indians  Criticism of the neologism Native American  comes from diverse sources  Russell Means  an American Indian activist  opposes the term Native American because he believes it was imposed by the government without the consent of American Indians  He has also argued that the use of the word Indian derives not from a confusion with India but from a Spanish expression En Dio  meaning  in God   144  Furthermore  some American Indians who   question the term Native American because  they argue  it serves to ease the conscience of  white America  with regard to past injustices done to American Indians by effectively eliminating  Indians  from the present  145  Still others  both Indians and non Indians  who   argue that Native American is problematic because  native of  literally means  born in   so any person born in the Americas could be considered  native   The compound  Native American  is generally capitalized to differentiate the reference to the indigenous peoples  A 1995 U S  Census Bureau survey found that more Native Americans in the United States preferred American Indian to Native American  146  Most American Indians are comfortable with Indian  American Indian  and Native American  and the terms are often used interchangeably  147  The traditional term is reflected in the name chosen for the National Museum of the American Indian  which opened in 2004 on the Mall in Washington  D C   Recently  the U S  Census Bureau has introduced the  Asian Indian  category to avoid ambiguity for descendants of people from India   edit  Gambling industry Sandia Casino  owned by the Sandia Pueblo of New Mexico Main article  Native American gaming Gambling has become a leading industry  Casinos operated by many Native American governments in the United States are creating a stream of gambling revenue that some communities are beginning to use as leverage to build diversified economies  Native American communities have waged and prevailed in legal battles to assure recognition of rights to self determination and to use of natural resources  Some of those rights  known as treaty rights  are enumerated in early treaties signed with the young United States government  Tribal sovereignty has become a cornerstone of American jurisprudence  and at least on the surface  in national legislative policies  Although many Native American tribes have casinos  the impact of Native American gaming is widely debated  Some tribes  such as the Winnemem Wintu of Redding  California  feel that casinos and their proceeds destroy culture from the inside out  These tribes refuse to participate in the gambling industry   edit  Society  language  and culture  edit  Ethno linguistic

Oregon  and California to the U S  Southwest and northern Mexico  with one outlier in the Plains   Another area of considerable diversity appears to have been the Southeast  however  many of these languages became extinct from European contact and as a result they are  for the most part  absent from the historical record   edit  Cultural aspects Hopi woman dressing hair of unmarried girl from 1900  Sheep remain an important aspect in Navajo Tradition and Culture  Though cultural features  language  clothing  and customs vary enormously from one tribe to another  there are certain elements which are encountered frequently and shared by many tribes  Early hunter gatherer tribes made stone weapons from around 10 000 years ago  as the age of metallurgy dawned  newer technologies were used and more efficient weapons produced  Prior to contact with Europeans  most tribes used similar weaponry  The most common implements were the bow and arrow  the war club  and the spear  Quality  material  and design varied widely  Native American use of fire both helped provide and prepare for food and altered the landscape of the continent to help the human population flourish  Large mammals like mammoths and mastodons were largely extinct by around 8000 BCE  Native Americans switched to hunting other large game  such as bison  The Great Plains tribes were still hunting the bison when they first encountered the Europeans  The Spanish reintroduction of the horse to North America in the 17th century and Native Americans  learning to use them greatly altered the natives  culture  including changing the way in which they hunted large game   Evidence of pre historic horses prior to the arrival of the Spanish has been found in the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles  CA  148  149   In addition  horses became such a valuable  central element of Native lives that they were counted as a measure of wealth   edit  Organization Zuni girl with pottery jar on her head in 1909  edit  Gens structure Early European American scholars described the Native Americans as having a society dominated by clans or gentes  in the Roman model  before tribes were formed  There were some common

quality pottery and formalized pictorial arts  Navajo spirituality focused on the maintenance of a harmonious relationship with the spirit world  often achieved by ceremonial acts  usually

crop the Native Americans grew was squash  Others early crops included cotton  sunflower  pumpkins  tobacco  goosefoot  knotgrass  and sump weed  Agriculture in the southwest started around 4 000 years ago when traders brought cultigens from Mexico  Due to the varying climate  some ingenuity was needed for agriculture to be successful  The climate in the southwest ranged from cool  moist mountains regions  to dry  sandy soil in the desert  Some innovations of the time included irrigation to bring water into the dry regions and the selection of seed based on the traits of the growing plants that bore them  In the southwest  they grew beans that were self supported  much like the way they are grown today  In the east  however  they were planted right by corn in order for the vines to be able to  climb  the cornstalks  The most important crop the Native Americans raised was maize  It was first started in Mesoamerica and spread north  About 2 000 years ago it reached eastern America  This crop was important to the Native Americans because it was part of their everyday diet  it could be stored in underground pits during the winter  and no part of it was wasted  The husk was made into art crafts  and the cob was used as fuel for fires  By 800 CE the Native Americans had established three main crops   beans  squash  and corn   called the three sisters  The agriculture gender roles of the Native Americans varied from region to region  In the southwest area  men prepared the soil with hoes  The women were in charge of planting  weeding  and harvesting the crops  In most other regions  the women were in charge of doing everything  including clearing the land  Clearing the land was an immense chore since the Native Americans rotated fields frequently  There is a tradition that Squanto showed the Pilgrims in New England how to put fish in fields to act like a fertilizer  but the truth of this story is debated  Native Americans did plant beans next to corn  the beans would replace the nitrogen which the corn took from the ground  as well as using corn stalks for support for climbing  Native Americans used controlled fires to burn weeds and clear fields  this would put nutrients back into the ground  If this did not work  they would simply abandon the field to let it be fallow  and find a new spot for cultivation  Europeans in the eastern part of the continent observed that Natives cleared large areas for cropland  Their fields in New England sometimes covered hundreds of acres  Colonists in Virginia noted thousands of acres under cultivation by Native Americans  152  Native Americans commonly used tools such as the hoe  maul  and dibber  The hoe was the main tool used to till the land and prepare it for planting  then it was used for weeding  The first versions were made out of wood and stone  When the settlers brought iron  Native Americans switched to iron hoes and hatchets  The dibber was a digging stick  used to plant the seed  Once the plants were harvested  women prepared the produce for eating  They used the maul to grind the corn into mash  It was cooked and eaten that way or baked as corn bread  153   edit  Religion Further

belief systems are still held by many of the  traditional  people  specify  These spiritualities may accompany adherence to another faith  or can represent a person s primary religious identity  While much Native American spiritualism exists in a tribal cultural continuum  and as such cannot be easily separated from tribal identity itself  certain other more clearly defined movements have arisen among  traditional  Native American practitioners  these being identifiable as  religions  in the clinical sense  Traditional practices of some tribes include the use of sacred herbs such as tobacco  sweetgrass or sage  Many Plains tribes have sweatlodge ceremonies  though the specifics of the ceremony vary among tribes  Fasting  singing and prayer in the ancient languages of their people  and sometimes drumming are also common  citation needed  The Midewiwin Lodge is a traditional medicine society inspired by the oral traditions and prophesies of the Ojibwa  Chippewa  and related tribes  Another significant religious body among Native peoples is known as the Native American Church  It is a syncretistic church incorporating elements of Native spiritual practice from a number of different tribes as well as symbolic elements from Christianity  Its main rite is the peyote ceremony  Prior to 1890  traditional religious beliefs included Wakan Tanka  In the American Southwest  especially New Mexico  a syncretism between the Catholicism brought by Spanish missionaries and the native religion is common  the religious drums  chants  and dances of the Pueblo people are regularly part of Masses at Santa Fe s Saint Francis Cathedral  154  Native American Catholic syncretism is also found elsewhere in the United States   e g   the National Kateri Tekakwitha Shrine in Fonda  New York and the National Shrine of the North American Martyrs in Auriesville  New York   The eagle feather law  Title 50 Part 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations  stipulates that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain eagle feathers for religious or spiritual use  The law does not allow Native Americans to give eagle feathers to non Native Americans   edit  Gender roles Main article  Gender roles in First Nations and Native American tribes Dr  Susan La Flesche Picotte was the first Native American woman to become a physician in the United States  Gender roles were differentiated in most Native American tribes  and both had power in decisionmaking within the tribe  Many tribes  such as the Haudenosaunee Five Nations and the Southeast Muskogean tribes  had matrilineal systems  in which property and hereditary leadership were controlled by and passed through the maternal lines  The children were considered to belong to the mother s clan and achieved status within it  When the tribe adopted war captives  the children became part of their mother s clan and accepted in the tribe  In Cherokee and other matrilineal cultures  wives owned the family property  When young women married  their husbands joined them in their mother s household  This enabled the young women to have assistance for childbirth and rearing  it also protected her in case of conflicts between the couple  If they separated or the man was killed at war  the woman had her family to assist her  In addition  in matrilineal culture  the mother s brother was the leading male figure in a male child s life  as he mentored the child within the mother s clan  The husband had no standing in his wife s and children s clan  as he belonged to his own mother s clan  Hereditary clan chief positions passed through the mother s line  not the father s  Chiefs were selected on recommendation of women elders  who also could disapprove of a chief  There were sometimes hereditary roles for men called peace chiefs  but war chiefs were selected based on proven prowess in battle  Men usually had the roles of hunting  waging war  and negotiating with other tribes  including the Europeans after their arrival  Others were patriarchal  although several different systems were in use  In the patrilineal tribes  such as the Omaha  Osage and Ponca  hereditary leadership passed through the male line  and children were considered to belong to the father and his clan  For this reason  when Europeans or American men took wives from such tribes  their children were considered  white  like their fathers  or  half breeds   Generally such children could have no official place in the tribe because their fathers did not belong to it  unless they were adopted by a male and made part of his family  155  Men hunted  traded and made war  The women had primary responsibility for the survival and welfare of the families  and future of the tribe   they gathered and cultivated plants  used plants and herbs to treat illnesses  cared for the young and the elderly  made all the clothing and instruments  and processed and cured meat and skins from the game  They tanned hides to make clothing as well as bags  saddle cloths  and tepee covers  Mothers used cradleboards to carry an infant while working or traveling  156  At least several dozen tribes allowed polygyny to sisters  with procedural and economic limits  150  Apart from making homes  women had many additional tasks that were also essential for the survival of the tribes  They made weapons and tools  took care of the roofs of their homes and often helped their men hunt bison  157  In some of the Plains Indian tribes  medicine women gathered herbs and cured the ill  158  The Sioux girls were encouraged to learn to ride  hunt and fight  159  Though fighting was mostly left to the boys and men  occasionally women fought with them  especially if the tribe was severely threatened  160   edit  Sports Native American leisure time led to competitive individual and team sports  Jim Thorpe  Notah Begay III  Jacoby Ellsbury  and Billy

speech  Eisenhower recalled Thorpe   Here and there  there are some people who are supremely endowed  My memory goes back to Jim Thorpe  He never practiced in his life  and he could do anything better than any other football player I ever saw   163  In the 1912 Olympics  Thorpe could run the 100 yard dash in 10 seconds flat  the 220 in 21 8 seconds  the 440 in 51 8 seconds  the 880 in 1 57  the mile in 4 35  the 120 yard high hurdles in 15 seconds  and the 220 yard low hurdles in 24 seconds  164  He could long jump 23 ft 6 in and high jump 6 ft 5 in  164  He could pole vault 11 feet  3 4 m   put the shot 47 ft 9 in  14 55 m   throw the javelin 163 feet  50 m   and throw the discus 136 feet  41 m   164  Thorpe entered the U S  Olympic trials for both the pentathlon and the decathlon  Billy Mills  a Lakota and USMC officer  won the gold medal in the 10 000 meter run at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics  He was the only American ever to win the Olympic gold in this event  An unknown prior to the Olympics  Mills finished second in the U S  Olympic trials  Billy Kidd  part Abenaki from Vermont  became the first American male to medal in alpine skiing in the Olympics  taking silver at age 20 in the slalom in the 1964 Winter Olympics at Innsbruck  Austria  Six years later at the 1970 World Championships  Kidd won the gold medal in the combined event and took the bronze medal in the slalom   edit  Music and art Main articles  Native American music and Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas Jake Fragua  Jemez Pueblo from New Mexico Traditional Native American music is almost entirely monophonic  but there are notable exceptions  Native American music often includes drumming and or the playing of rattles or other percussion instruments but little other instrumentation  Flutes and whistles made of wood  cane  or bone are also played  generally by individuals  but in former times also by large ensembles  as noted by Spanish conquistador de Soto   The tuning of modern flutes is typically pentatonic  Performers with Native American parentage have occasionally appeared in American popular music  such as Robbie Robertson  The Band   Rita Coolidge  Wayne Newton  Gene Clark  Buffy Sainte Marie  Blackfoot  Tori Amos  Redbone  and CocoRosie  Some  such as John Trudell  have used music to comment on life in Native America  and others  such as R  Carlos Nakai integrate traditional sounds with modern sounds in instrumental recordings  A variety of small and medium sized recording companies offer an abundance of recent music by Native American performers young and old  ranging from pow wow drum music to hard driving rock and roll and rap  The most widely practiced public musical form among Native Americans in the United States is that of the pow wow  At pow wows  such as the annual Gathering of Nations in Albuquerque  New Mexico  members of drum groups sit in a circle around a large drum  Drum groups play in unison while they sing in a native language and dancers in colorful regalia dance clockwise around the drum groups in the center  Familiar pow wow songs include honor songs  intertribal songs  crow hops  sneak up songs  grass dances  two steps  welcome songs  going home songs  and war songs  Most indigenous communities in the United States also maintain traditional songs and ceremonies  some of which are shared and practiced exclusively within the community  165  Native American art comprises a major category in the world art collection  Native American contributions include pottery  paintings  jewellery  weavings  sculpture  basketry  and carvings  Franklin Gritts was a Cherokee artist who taught students from many tribes at Haskell Institute  now Haskell Indian Nations University  in the 1940s  the Golden Age of Native American painters  The integrity of certain Native American artworks is protected by an act of Congress that prohibits representation of art as Native American when it is not the product of an enrolled Native American artist   edit  Economy The Inuit  or Eskimo  prepared and buried large amounts of dried meat and fish  Pacific Northwest tribes crafted seafaring dugouts 40 50 feet  12 15 m  long for fishing  Farmers in the Eastern Woodlands tended fields of maize with hoes and digging sticks  while their neighbors in the Southeast grew tobacco as well as food crops  On the Plains  some tribes engaged in agriculture but also planned buffalo hunts in which herds were driven over bluffs  Dwellers of the Southwest deserts hunted small animals and gathered acorns to grind into flour with which they baked wafer thin bread on top of heated stones  Some groups on the region s mesas developed irrigation techniques  and filled storehouses with grain as protection against the area s frequent droughts  In the early years  as these native peoples encountered European explorers and settlers and engaged in trade  they exchanged food  crafts  and furs for blankets  iron and steel implements  horses  trinkets  firearms  and alcoholic beverages   edit  Barriers to economic development  The King of the Seas in the Hands of the Makahs   photograph taken in 1910 of Makah Native Americans Today  other than tribes successfully running casinos  many tribes struggle  as they are often located on reservations isolated from the main economic centers of the country  The estimated 2 1 million Native Americans are the most impoverished of all ethnic groups  According to the 2000 Census  an estimated 400 000 Native Americans reside on reservation land  While some tribes have had success with gaming  only 40  of the 562 federally recognized tribes operate casinos  166  According to a 2007 survey by the U S  Small Business Administration  only 1  of Native Americans own and operate a business  167  Native Americans rank at the bottom of nearly every social statistic  highest teen suicide rate of all minorities at 18 5 per 100 000  highest rate of teen pregnancy  highest high school drop out rate at 54   lowest per capita income  and unemployment rates between 50  to 90   Many clarification needed  Native Americans have become urbanized to survive  moving to urban centers in the states where their reservations are  or out of state  citation needed  Others have entered academic and political fields that take them away from the reservations  citation needed  The barriers to economic development on Native American reservations have been identified by Joseph Kalt 168  and Stephen Cornell 169  of the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development at Harvard University  in their report  What Can Tribes Do  Strategies and Institutions in American Indian Economic Development  2008   170  are summarized as follows  Lack of access to capital  Lack of human capital  education  skills  technical expertise  and the means to develop it  Reservations lack effective planning  Reservations are poor in natural resources  Reservations have natural resources  but lack sufficient control over them  Reservations are disadvantaged by their distance from markets and the high costs of transportation  Tribes cannot persuade investors to locate on reservations because of intense competition from non Native American communities  The Bureau of Indian Affairs is inept  corrupt  and or uninterested in reservation development  Tribal politicians and bureaucrats are inept or corrupt  On reservation factionalism destroys stability in tribal decisions  The instability of tribal government keeps outsiders from investing   Many tribes adopted constitutions by the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act model  with two year terms for elected positions of chief and council members deemed too short by the authors for getting things done  Entrepreneurial skills and experience are scarce  Tribal cultures get in the way  A major barrier to development is the lack of entrepreneurial knowledge and experience within Indian reservations   A general lack of education and experience about business is a significant challenge to prospective entrepreneurs   was the report on Native American entrepreneurship by the Northwest Area Foundation in 2004   Native American communities that lack entrepreneurial traditions and recent experiences typically do not provide the support that entrepreneurs need to thrive  Consequently  experiential entrepreneurship education needs to be embedded into school curricula and after school and other community activities  This would allow students to learn the essential elements of entrepreneurship from a young age and encourage them to apply these elements throughout life    171 Rez Biz magazine addresses these issues   edit  Native Americans  Europeans  and Africans Lillian Gross  described as a  Mixed Blood  by the Smithsonian source  was of Cherokee and European American heritage  Raised within Cherokee culture  she identified with that  Interracial relations between Native Americans  Europeans  and Africans is a complex issue that has been mostly neglected with  few in depth studies on interracial relationships   172  173  Some of the first documented cases of European Native American intermarriage and contact were recorded in Post Columbian Mexico  One case is that of Gonzalo Guerrero  a European from Spain  who was shipwrecked along the Yucatan Peninsula  and fathered three Mestizo children with a Mayan noblewoman  Another is the case of Hern n Cort s and his mistress La Malinche  who gave birth to another of the first multi racial people in the Americas  174   edit  Assimilation European impact was immediate  widespread  and profound more than any other race that had contact with Native Americans during the early years of colonization and nationhood  Europeans living among Native Americans were often called  white indians   They  lived in native communities for years  learned native languages fluently  attended native councils  and often fought alongside their native companions   175  The 1725 return of an Osage bride from a trip to Paris  France  The Osage woman was married to a French soldier  Early contact was often charged with tension and emotion  but also had moments of friendship  cooperation  and intimacy  176  Marriages took place in English  Spanish  and French colonies between Native Americans and Europeans  Given the preponderance of men among the colonists in the early years  generally European men married American Indian women  In 1528  Isabel de Moctezuma  an heir of Moctezuma II  was married to Alonso de Grado  a Spanish Conquistador  After his death  the widow married Juan Cano de Saavedra  Together they had five children  Many heirs of Emperor Moctezuma II were acknowledged by the Spanish crown  who granted them titles including Duke of Moctezuma de Tultengo  On April 5  1614  Pocahontas married the Englishman John Rolfe  They had a child called Thomas Rolfe  Intimate relations among Native American and Europeans were widespread  beginning with the French and Spanish explorers and trappers  For instance  in the early 19th century  the Native American woman Sacagawea  who would help translate for the Lewis and Clark Expedition  was married to the French Canadian trapper Toussaint Charbonneau  They had a son named Jean Baptiste Charbonneau  This was the most typical pattern among the traders and trappers  Five Indians and a Captive  painted by Carl Wimar  1855 There was fear on both sides  as the different peoples realized how different their societies were  176  The whites regarded the Indians as  savage  because they were not Christian  They were suspicious of cultures which they did not understand  176  The Native American author  Andrew J  Blackbird  wrote in his History of the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan   1897   that white settlers introduced some immoralities into Native American tribes  Many Indians suffered because the Europeans introduced alcohol and the whiskey trade resulted in alcoholism among the people  who were alcohol intolerant  176  Blackbird wrote   The Ottawas and Chippewas were quite virtuous in their primitive state  as there were no illegitimate children reported in our old traditions  But very lately this evil came to exist among the Ottawas so lately that the second case among the Ottawas of  Arbor Croche  is yet living in 1897  And from that time this evil came to be quite frequent  for immorality has been introduced among these people by evil white persons who bring their vices into the tribes   176  The U  S  government had two purposes when making land agreements with Native Americans  to open it up more land for white settlement  177  and to ease tensions between whites and Native Americans by forcing Natives to use the land in the same way as did the whites   for subsistence farms  177  The government used a variety of strategies to achieve these goals  many treaties required Native Americans to become farmers in order to keep their land  177  Government officials often did not translate the documents which Native Americans were forced to sign  and native chiefs often had little or no idea what they were signing  177  For a Native American man to marry a white woman  he had to get consent of her parents  as long as  he can prove to support her as a white woman in a good home   178  In the early 19th century  the Shawnee Tecumseh and blonde hair  amp  blued eyed Rebbecca Galloway had a inter racial affair  In the late 19th century  three European American middle class women teachers at Hampton Institute married Native American men whom they had met as students  179  As European American women started working independently at missions and Indian schools in the western states  there were more opportunities for their meeting and developing relationships with Native American men  For instance  Charles Eastman  a man of European and Lakota descent whose father sent both his sons to Dartmouth College  got his medical degree at Boston University and returned to the West to practice  He married Elaine Goodale  whom he met in South Dakota  He was the grandson of Seth Eastman  a military officer from Maine  and a chief s daughter  Goodale was a young European American teacher from Massachusetts and a reformer  who was appointed as the US superintendent of Native American education for the reservations in the Dakota Territory  They had six children together   edit  Native American and African relations Further information  Black Indians African and Native Americans have interacted for centuries  The earliest record of Native American and African contact occurred in April 1502  when Spanish colonists transported the first Africans to Hispaniola to serve as slaves  180  Sometimes Native Americans resented the presence of African Americans  181  The  Catawaba tribe in 1752 showed great anger and bitter resentment when an African American came among them as a trader   181  To gain favor with Europeans  the Cherokee exhibited the strongest color prejudice of all Native Americans  182  He contends that because of European fears of a unified revolt of Native Americans and African Americans  the colonists encouraged hostility between the ethnic groups   Whites sought to convince Native Americans that African Americans worked against their best interests   183  In 1751  South Carolina law stated   The carrying of Negroes among the Indians has all along been thought detrimental  as an intimacy ought to be avoided   184  In addition  in 1758 the governor of South Carolina James Glen wrote  it has always been the policy of this government to create an aversion in them Indians to Negroes  68  Europeans considered both races inferior and made efforts to make both Native Americans and Africans enemies  66  Native Americans were rewarded if they returned escaped slaves  and African Americans were rewarded for fighting in the late nineteenth century Indian Wars  66  185  186  Ras K Dee  Pomo Kenyan singer and editor from California  Native Americans  during the transitional period of Africans becoming the primary race enslaved  were enslaved at the same time and shared a common experience of enslavement  They worked together  lived together in communal quarters  produced collective recipes for food  shared herbal remedies  myths and legends  and in the end they intermarried   67  Because of a shortage of men due to warfare  many tribes encouraged marriage between the two groups  to create stronger  healthier children from the unions  187  In the 18th century  many Native American women married freed or runaway African men due to a decrease in the population of men in Native American villages  66  Records show that many Native American women bought African men but  unknown to the European sellers  the women freed and married the men into their tribe  66  When African men married or had children by a Native American woman  their children were born free  because the mother was free  according to the principle of partus sequitur ventrum  which the colonists incorporated into law   66  European colonists often required the return of runaway slaves to be included as a provision in treaties with American Indians  In 1726  the British Governor of New York exacted a promise from the Iroquois to return all runaway slaves who had joined up with them  188  In the mid 1760s  the government requested the Huron and Delaware to return runaway slaves  but there was no record of slaves having been returned  189  Colonists placed ads about runaway slaves  While numerous tribes used captive enemies as servants and slaves  they also often adopted younger captives into their tribes to replace members who had died  In the Southeast  a few Native American tribes began to adopt a slavery system similar to that of the American colonists  buying African American slaves  especially the Cherokee  Choctaw  and Creek  Though less than 3  of Native Americans owned slaves  divisions grew among the Native Americans over slavery  69  Among the Cherokee  records show that slave holders in the tribe were largely the children of European men that had shown their children the economics of slavery  185  As European colonists took slaves into frontier areas  there were more opportunities for relationships between African and Native American peoples  66  Based on the work of geneticists  a PBS series on African Americans explained that while most African Americans are racially mixed  it is relatively rare that they have Native American ancestry  190  191  According to the PBS series  the most common  non black  mix is English and Scots Irish  190  191  However  the Y chromosome and mtDNA  mitochondrial DNA  testing processes for direct line male and female ancestors can fail to pick up the heritage of many ancestors   Some critics thought the PBS series did not sufficiently explain the limitations of DNA testing for assessment of heritage   192  Another study suggests that relatively few Native Americans have African American heritage  193  A study reported in The American Journal of Human Genetics stated   We analyzed the European genetic contribution to 10 populations of African descent in the United States  Maywood  Illinois  Detroit  New York  Philadelphia  Pittsburgh  Baltimore  Charleston  South Carolina  New Orleans  and Houston      mtDNA haplogroups analysis shows no evidence of a significant maternal Amerindian contribution to any of the 10 populations   194  A few writers persist in the myth that most African Americans have Native American heritage  195  DNA testing has limitations and should not be depended on by individuals to answer all their questions about heritage  192  196  So far  such testing cannot distinguish among the many distinct Native American tribes  No tribes accept DNA testing to satisfy their differing qualifications for membership  usually based on documented blood quantum or descent from ancestor s  listed on the Dawes Rolls  197   edit  Blood Quantum Main article  Blood quantum laws Further information  Cherokee Freedmen Controversy Members of the Creek  Muscogee  Nation in Oklahoma around 1877  they include men with some European and African ancestry  198  Intertribal mixing was common among Native American tribes  so individuals often had ancestry from more than one tribe  particularly after tribes lost so many members from disease  39  40  Bands or entire tribes occasionally split or merged to form more viable groups in reaction to the pressures of climate  disease and warfare  199  A number of tribes traditionally adopted captives into their group to replace members who had been captured or killed in battle  These captives were from rival tribes and later from European settlements  Some tribes also sheltered or adopted white traders and runaway slaves  and others owned slaves of their own  Tribes with long trading histories with Europeans show a higher rate of European admixture  reflecting years of intermarriage between European men and Native American women  199  A number of paths to genetic and ethnic diversity among Native Americans existed  In recent years  genetic genealogists have been able to determine the proportion of Native American ancestry carried by the African American population  The literary and history scholar Henry Louis Gates  Jr  had experts on his TV programs about African American ancestry  They stated that 5  of African Americans have at least 12 5  Native American ancestry  A greater percentage could have a smaller proportion of Indian ancestry  but their conclusions show that popular estimates of admixture may have been too high  200  DNA testing is not sufficient to qualify a person for specific tribal membership as it cannot distinguish among Native American groups  Native American identity has historically been based on culture  not just biology  as many American Indian peoples adopted captives from their enemies and assimilated them into their tribes  The Indigenous Peoples Council on Biocolonialism  IPCB  notes that   Native American markers  are not found solely among Native Americans  While they occur more frequently among Native Americans  they are also found in people in other parts of the world  201  Geneticists state  Not all Native Americans have been tested  especially with the large number of deaths due to disease such as small pox  it is unlikely that Native Americans only have the genetic markers they have identified  even when their maternal or paternal bloodline does not include a non Native American  192  196  To receive tribal services  a Native American must belong to  and be certified by  a recognized tribal organization  Each tribal government makes its own rules for eligibility of citizens or tribal members  The federal government has standards related to services available to certified Native Americans  For instance  federal scholarships for Native Americans require the student to be enrolled in a federally recognized tribe and have at least one quarter Native American descent  equivalent to one grandparent   attested to by a Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood  CDIB  card  Among tribes  qualification may be based upon a required percentage of Native American  blood   or the  blood quantum   of an individual seeking recognition  or documented descent from an ancestor on the Dawes Rolls or other registers  Some tribes have begun requiring genealogical DNA testing  but this is usually related to an individual s proving parentage or direct descent from a certified member  202  Requirements for tribal membership vary widely by tribe  The Cherokee require documented genealogical descent from a Native American listed on the early 1906 Dawes Rolls  Tribal rules regarding recognition of members who have heritage from multiple tribes are equally diverse and complex  Tribal membership conflicts have led to a number of legal disputes  court cases  and the formation of activist groups  One example of this are the Cherokee Freedmen  Today  they include descendants of African Americans once enslaved by the Cherokees  who were granted  by federal treaty  citizenship in the historic Cherokee Nation as freedmen after the Civil War  The modern Cherokee Nation  in the early 1980s  excluded them from citizenship  unless individuals can prove descent from a Cherokee Native American  not Cherokee Freedmen  listed on the Dawes Rolls  Since the 20th century  an increasing number of European Americans seem interested in claiming descent from Native Americans  Many people have claimed descent from the Cherokee  203  Kateri Tekakwitha  the patron of ecologists  exiles  and orphans  was beatified by

atDNA  markers are also used  but differ from mtDNA or Y DNA in that they overlap significantly  209  AtDNA is generally used to measure the average continent of ancestry genetic admixture in the entire human genome and related isolated populations  209  The genetic pattern indicates Indigenous Americans experienced two very distinctive genetic episodes  first with the initial peopling of the Americas  and secondly with European colonization of the Americas  16  210  211  The former is the determinant factor for the number of gene lineages  zygosity mutations and founding haplotypes present in today s Indigenous Amerindian populations  210  Human settlement of the New World occurred in stages from the Bering sea coast line  with an initial 15  000 to 20 000 year layover on Beringia for the small founding population  16  212  213  The micro satellite diversity and distributions of the Y lineage specific to South America indicates that certain Amerindian populations have been isolated since the initial colonization of the region  214  The Na Den   Inuit and Indigenous Alaskan populations exhibit haplogroup Q  Y DNA  mutations  however  that are distinct from other indigenous Amerindians  and that have various mtDNA and atDNA mutations  215  216  217  This suggests that the paleo Indian migrants into the northern extremes of North America and Greenland were descended from a later  independent migrant population  218  219   edit  See also Indigenous peoples of North America portal United States portal Aboriginal peoples in Canada Alaska natives American
