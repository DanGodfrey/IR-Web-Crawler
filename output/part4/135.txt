South Asia  It is the seventh largest country by geographical area  the second most populous country with over 1 2 billion people  and the most populous democracy in the world  Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south  the Arabian Sea on the south west  and the Bay of Bengal on the south east  it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west  d China  Nepal  and Bhutan to the north east  and Burma and Bangladesh to the east  In the Indian Ocean  India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives  in addition  India s Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia  Home to the ancient Indus Valley Civilization and a region of historic trade routes and vast empires  the Indian subcontinent was identified with its commercial and cultural wealth for much of its long history  8  Four of the world s major religions Hinduism  Buddhism  Jainism  and Sikhism originated here  whereas Zoroastrianism  Christianity  and Islam arrived in the 1st millennium CE and also helped shape the region s diverse culture  Gradually annexed by and brought under the administration of the British East India Company from the early 18th century and administered directly by the United Kingdom from the mid 19th century  India became an independent nation in 1947 after a struggle for independence that was marked by non violent resistance and led by Mahatma Gandhi  The Indian economy is the world s tenth largest by nominal GDP and third largest by purchasing power parity  PPP   Following market based economic reforms in 1991  India became one of the fastest growing major economies  it is considered a newly industrialised country  However  it continues to face the challenges of poverty  illiteracy  corruption  and inadequate public healthcare  A nuclear weapons state and a regional power  it has the third largest standing army in the world and ranks ninth in military expenditure among nations  India is a federal constitutional republic governed under a

Sindhu  which was the historical local appellation for the Indus River  9  The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi          which translates as  the people of the Indus   10  The geographical term Bharat  pronounced   b a r t     listen    which is recognised by the Constitution of India as an official name for the country  is used by many Indian languages in various subtle guises  11  The eponym of Bharat is Bharata  a mythological figure that Hindu scriptures describe as a legendary emperor of ancient India  Hindustan     nd   st a n    listen   was originally a Persian word that meant  Land of the Hindus   prior to 1947  it referred to a region that encompassed northern India and Pakistan  It is occasionally used to solely denote India in its entirety  12  13  History Main articles  History of India and History of the Republic of India Ancient India The earliest anatomically modern human remains found in South Asia date from approximately 30 000 years ago  14  Nearly contemporaneous Mesolithic rock art sites have been found in many parts of the Indian subcontinent  including at the Bhimbetka rock shelters in Madhya Pradesh  15  Around 7000 BCE  the first known Neolithic settlements appeared on the subcontinent in Mehrgarh and other sites in western Pakistan  16  These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilization  17  the first urban culture in South Asia  18  it flourished during 2500 1900 BCE in Pakistan and western India  19  Centred around cities such as Mohenjo daro  Harappa  Dholavira  and Kalibangan  and relying on varied forms of subsistence  the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide ranging trade  18  Paintings at the Ajanta Caves in Aurangabad  Maharashtra  6th century During the period 2000 500 BCE  in terms of culture  many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic to the Iron Age  20  The Vedas  the oldest scriptures of Hinduism  21  were composed during this period  22  and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Indo Gangetic Plain  20  Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north west  23  21  24  The caste system  which created a hierarchy of priests  warriors  and free peasants  but which excluded indigenous peoples by labeling their occupations impure  arose during this period  25  On the Deccan Plateau  archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation  20  In southern India  a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period  26  as well as by nearby traces of agriculture  irrigation tanks  and craft traditions  26  In the late Vedic period  around the 5th century BCE  the small chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas  27  28  The emerging urbanisation and the orthodoxies of this age also created the religious reform movements of Buddhism and Jainism  29  both of which became independent religions  30  Buddhism  based on the teachings of India s first historical figure  Gautama Buddha  attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle  29  31  Jainism came into prominence around the same time during the life of its exemplar  Mahavira  32  In an age of increasing urban wealth  both religions held up renunciation as an ideal  33  and both established long lasting monasteries  27  Politically  by the 3rd century BCE  the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire  27  The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent excepting the far south  but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas  34  35  The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka s renunciation of militarism and far flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma  36  37  The Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that  between 200 BCE and 200 CE  the southern peninsula was being ruled by the Cheras  the Cholas  and the Pandyas  dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and South East Asia  38  39  In North India  Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family  leading to increased subordination of women  40  27  By the 4th and 5th centuries  the Gupta Empire had created in the greater Ganges Plain a complex system of administration and taxation that became a model for later Indian kingdoms  41  42  Under the Guptas  a renewed Hinduism based on devotion rather than the management of ritual began to assert itself  43  The renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture  which found patrons among an urban elite  42 Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well  and Indian science  astronomy  medicine  and mathematics made significant advances  42  Medieval India The granite tower of Brihadeeswarar Temple in Thanjavur was completed in 1010 CE by Raja Raja Chola I  The Indian early medieval age  600 CE to 1200 CE  is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity  44  When Harsha of Kannauj  who ruled much of the Indo Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE  attempted to expand southwards  he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan  45  When his successor attempted to expand eastwards  he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal  45  When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards  they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south  who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south  45  No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond his core region  44  During this time  pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society  as were new non traditional ruling classes  46  The caste system consequently began to show regional differences  46  In the 6th and 7th centuries  the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language  47  They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent  47  Indian royalty  big and small  and the temples they patronised  drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities  which became economic hubs as well  48  Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation  48  By the 8th and 9th centuries  the effects were felt in South East Asia  as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern day Thailand  Laos  Cambodia  Vietnam  Malaysia  and Java  49  Indian merchants  scholars  and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission  South East Asians took the initiative as well  with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages  49  After the 10th century  Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans  using swift horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion  repeatedly overran South Asia s north western plains  leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206  50  The sultanate was to control much of North India  and to make many forays into South India  Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites  the sultanate largely left its vast non Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs  51  52  By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century  the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia  setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers  learned men  mystics  traders  artists  and artisans from that region into the subcontinent  thereby creating a syncretic Indo Islamic culture in the north  53  54  The sultanate s raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire  55  Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate  the empire came to control much of peninsular India  56  and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards  55  Early modern India Scribes and artists in the Mughal court  1590 1595 In the early 16th century  northern India  being then under mainly Muslim rulers  57  fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors  58  The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule  but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices 59  60  and diverse and inclusive ruling elites  61  leading to more systematic  centralised  and uniform rule  62  Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity  especially under Akbar  the Mughals united their far flung realms through loyalty  expressed through a Persianised culture  to an emperor who had near divine status  61  The Mughal state s economic policies  deriving most revenues from agriculture 63  and mandating that taxes be paid in the well regulated silver currency  64  caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets  62  The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India s economic expansion  62  resulting in greater patronage of painting  literary forms  textiles  and architecture  65  Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India  such as the Marathas  the Rajputs  and the Sikhs  gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule  which  through collaboration or adversity  gave them both recognition and military experience  66  Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India  66  As the empire disintegrated  many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs  67  By the early 18th century  with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred  a number of European trading companies  including the English East India Company  had established coastal outposts  68  69  The East India Company s control of the seas  greater resources  and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly flex its military muscle and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite  both these factors were crucial in allowing the Company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies  70  68  71  72  Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s  73  India was now no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had  but was instead supplying the British empire with raw materials  and many historians consider this to be the onset of India s colonial period  68  By this time  with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and itself effectively made an arm of British administration  the Company began to more consciously enter non economic arenas such as education  social reform  and culture  74  Modern India The British Indian Empire  from the 1909 edition of The Imperial Gazetteer of India  Areas directly governed by the British are shaded pink  nominally sovereign princely states are in yellow  Historians consider India s modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885  The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company rule in India set the stage for changes essential to a modern state  These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty  the surveillance of the population  and the education of citizens  Technological changes among them  railways  canals  and the telegraph were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe  75  76  77  78  However  disaffection with the Company also grew during this time  and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857  Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions  including invasive British style social reforms  harsh land taxes  and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes  the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule  79  80  Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858  it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and to the direct administration of India by the British government  Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British style parliamentary system  the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest  81  82  In the decades following  public life gradually emerged all over India  leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885  83  84  85  86  Jawaharlal Nehru  left  became India s first prime minister in 1947  Mahatma Gandhi  right  led the independence movement  The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far away markets  87  There was an increase in the number of large scale famines  88  and  despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers  little industrial employment was generated for Indians  89  There were also salutary effects  commercial cropping  especially in the newly canalled Punjab  led to increased food production for internal consumption  90  The railway network provided critical famine relief  91  notably reduced the cost of moving goods  91  and helped nascent Indian owned industry  90  After World War I  in which some one million Indians served  92  a new period began  It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation  by more strident Indian calls for self rule  and by the beginnings of a non violent movement of non cooperation  of which Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol  93  During the 1930s  slow legislative reform was enacted by the British  the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections  94  The next decade was beset with crises  Indian participation in World War II  the Congress s final push for non cooperation  and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism  All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947  but tempered by the bloody partition of the subcontinent into two states  India and Pakistan  95  Vital to India s self image as an independent nation was its constitution  completed in 1950  which put in place a sovereign  secular  and democratic republic  96  In the 60 years since  India has had a mixed bag of successes and failures  97  It has remained a democracy with civil liberties  an activist Supreme Court  and a largely independent press  97  Economic liberalisation  which was begun in the 1990s  has created a large urban middle class  transformed India into one of the world s fastest growing economies  98  and increased its geopolitical clout  Indian movies  music  and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture  97  Yet  India has also been weighed down by seemingly unyielding poverty  both rural and urban  97  by religious and caste related violence  99  by Maoist inspired Naxalite insurgencies  100  and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir  101  It has unresolved territorial disputes with China  which escalated into the Sino Indian War of 1962  102  and with Pakistan  which flared into wars fought in 1947  1965  1971  and 1999  102  The India Pakistan nuclear rivalry came to a head in 1998  103  India s sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world s new nations  however  in spite of its recent economic successes  freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved  104  Geography Main article  Geography of India See also  Geology of India A topographic map of India India comprises the bulk of the Indian subcontinent and lies atop the minor Indian tectonic plate  which in turn belongs to the Indo Australian Plate  105  India s defining geological processes commenced 75 million years ago when the Indian subcontinent  then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana  began a north eastward drift across the then unformed Indian Ocean that lasted fifty million years  105  The subcontinent s subsequent collision with  and subduction under  the Eurasian Plate bore aloft the planet s highest mountains  the Himalayas  They abut India in the north and the north east  105  In the former seabed immediately south of the emerging Himalayas  plate movement created a vast trough that has gradually filled with river borne sediment  106  it now forms the Indo Gangetic Plain  107  To the west lies the Thar Desert  which is cut off by the Aravalli Range  108  The original Indian plate survives as peninsular India  which is the oldest and geologically most stable part of India  it extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India  These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east  109  To the south  the remaining peninsular landmass  the Deccan Plateau  is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats  110  the plateau contains the nation s oldest rock formations  some of them over one billion years old  Constituted in such fashion  India lies to the north of the equator between 6  44  and 35  30  north latitude e  and 68  7  and 97  25  east longitude  111  The Kedar Range of the Greater Himalayas rises behind Kedarnath Temple  which is one of the twelve jyotirlinga shrines  India s coastline measures 7 517 kilometres  4 700 mi  in length  of this distance  5 423 kilometres  3 400 mi  belong to peninsular India and 2 094 kilometres  1 300 mi  to the Andaman  Nicobar  and Lakshadweep island chains  112  According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts  the mainland coastline consists of the following  43  sandy beaches  11  rocky shores  including cliffs  and 46  mudflats or marshy shores  112  Major Himalayan origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra  both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal  113  Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi  the latter s extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes  114  Major peninsular rivers  whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding  include the Godavari  the Mahanadi  the Kaveri  and the Krishna  which also drain into the Bay of Bengal  115  and the Narmada and the Tapti  which drain into the Arabian Sea  116  Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India  the latter is shared with Bangladesh  117  India has two archipelagos  the Lakshadweep  coral atolls off India s south western coast  and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands  a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea  118  The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert  both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons  119  The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in  keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes  120  121  The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture laden south west summer monsoon winds that  between June and October  provide the majority of India s rainfall  119  Four major climatic groupings predominate in India  tropical wet  tropical dry  subtropical humid  and montane  122  Biodiversity Main article  Wildlife of India The lotus  Nelumbo nucifera  is the Indian national flower  Hindus and Buddhists regard it as a sacred symbol of enlightenment  123  India lies within the Indomalaya ecozone and contains three biodiversity hotspots  124  One of 17 megadiverse countries  it hosts 7 6  of all mammalian  12 6  of all avian  6 2  of all reptilian  4 4  of all amphibian  11 7  of all piscine  and 6 0  of all flowering plant species  125 Endemism is high among plants  33   and among ecoregions such as the shola forests  126  Habitat ranges from the tropical rainforest of the Andaman Islands  Western Ghats  and North East India to the coniferous forest of the Himalaya  Between these extremes lie the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India  the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India  and the babul dominated thorn forest of the central Deccan and western Gangetic plain  127  Under 12  of India s landmass bears thick jungle  128  The medicinal neem  widely used in rural Indian herbal remedies  is a key Indian tree  The luxuriant pipal fig tree  shown on the seals of Mohenjo daro  shaded Gautama Buddha as he sought enlightenment  Shola highlands are found in Kudremukh National Park  which is part of the Western Ghats  Many Indian species descend from taxa originating in Gondwana  from which the Indian plate separated more than 105 million years before present  129 Peninsular India s subsequent movement towards and collision with the Laurasian landmass set off a mass exchange of species  Epochal volcanism and climatic changes 20 million years ago forced a mass extinction  130  Mammals then entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes flanking the rising Himalaya  127  Thus  while 45 8  of reptiles and 55 8  of amphibians are endemic  only 12 6  of mammals and 4 5  of birds are  125  Among them are the Nilgiri leaf monkey and Beddome s toad of the Western Ghats  India contains 172 IUCN designated threatened species  or 2 9  of endangered forms  131  These include the Asiatic lion  the Bengal tiger  and the Indian white rumped vulture  which  by ingesting the carrion of diclofenac laced cattle  nearly went extinct  The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife  In response the system of national parks and protected areas  first established in 1935  was substantially expanded  In 1972  India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act 132  and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness  the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988  133  India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and thirteen biosphere reserves  134  four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves  twenty five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention  135  Politics Main article  Politics of India A parliamentary joint session is held in the Sansad Bhavan  India is the world s most populous democracy  136  A parliamentary republic with a multi party system  137  it has six recognised national parties  including the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP   and more than 40 regional parties  138  The Congress is considered centre left or  liberal  in Indian political culture  and the BJP centre right or  conservative   For most of the period between 1950 when India first became a republic and the late 1980s  the Congress held a majority in the parliament  Since then  however  it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP  139  as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi party coalitions at the centre  140  In the Republic of India s first three general elections  in 1951  1957  and 1962  the Jawaharlal Nehru led Congress won easy victories  On Nehru s death in 1964  Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister  he was succeeded  after his own unexpected death in 1966  by Indira Gandhi  who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971  Following public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975  the Congress was voted out of power in 1977  the then new Janata Party  which had opposed the emergency  was voted in  Its government lasted just over three years  Voted back into power in 1980  the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984  when Indira Gandhi was assassinated  she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi  who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year  The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front coalition  led by the newly formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front  won the elections  that government too proved relatively short lived  it lasted just under two years  141  Elections were held again in 1991  no party won an absolute majority  But the Congress  as the largest single party  was able to form a minority government led by P  V  Narasimha Rao  142  A two year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996  Several short lived alliances shared power at the centre  The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996  it was followed by two comparatively long lasting United Front coalitions  which depended on external support  In 1998  the BJP was able to form a successful coalition  the National Democratic Alliance  or NDA  Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee  the NDA became the first non Congress government to complete a five year term  143  In the 2004 Indian general elections  again no party won an absolute majority  but the Congress emerged as the largest single party  forming another successful coalition  the United Progressive Alliance  or UPA  It had the support of left leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP  The UPA returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers  and it no longer required external support from India s communist parties  144  That year  Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re elected to a consecutive five year term  145  Government Main article  Government of India See also  Elections in India The Rashtrapati Bhavan is the official residence
