chelicerae with fangs that inject venom  They are the largest order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all other groups of organisms  1  Spiders are found worldwide on every continent except for Antarctica  and have become established in nearly every habitat with the exception of air and sea colonization  As of 2008  approximately 40 000 spider species  and 109 families have been recorded by taxonomists  2  however  there has been confusion within the scientific community as to how all these families should be classified  as evidenced by the over 20 different classifications that have been proposed since 1900  3  Anatomically  spiders differ from other arthropods in that the usual body segments are fused into two tagmata  the cephalothorax and abdomen  and joined by a small  cylindrical pedicel  Unlike insects  spiders do not have antennae  In all except the most primitive group  the Mesothelae  spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods  as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax  Unlike most arthropods  spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure  Their abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of silk glands within their abdomen  Spider webs vary widely in size  shape and the amount of sticky thread used  It now appears that the spiral orb web may be one of the earliest forms  and spiders that produce tangled cobwebs are more abundant and diverse than orb web spiders  Spider like arachnids with silk producing spigots appear in the Devonian period about 386 million years ago  but these animals apparently lacked spinnerets  True spiders have been found in Carboniferous rocks from 318 to 299 million years ago  and are very similar to the most primitive surviving order  the Mesothelae  The main groups of modern spiders  Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae  first appear in the Triassic period  before 200 million years ago  A herbivorous species  Bagheera kiplingi  was described in 2008  4  but all other known species are predators  mostly preying on insects and on other spiders  although a few large species also take birds and lizards  Spiders use a wide range of strategies to capture prey  trapping it in sticky webs  lassoing it with sticky bolas  mimicking the prey to avoid detection  or running it down  Most detect prey mainly by sensing vibrations  but the active hunters have acute vision  and hunters of the genus Portia show signs of intelligence in their choice of tactics and ability to develop new ones  Spiders  guts are too narrow to take solids  and they liquidize their food by flooding it with digestive enzymes and grinding it with the bases of their pedipalps  as they do not have true jaws  Male spiders identify themselves by a variety of complex courtship rituals to avoid being eaten by the females  Males of most species survive a few matings  limited mainly by their short life spans  Females weave silk egg cases  each of which may contain hundreds of eggs  Females of many species care for their young  for example by carrying them around or by sharing food with them  A minority of species are social  building communal webs that may house anywhere from a few to 50 000 individuals  Social behavior ranges from precarious toleration  as in the aggressive widow spiders  to co operative hunting and food sharing  Although most spiders live for at most two years  tarantulas and other mygalomorph spiders can live up to 25 years in captivity  While the venom of a few species is dangerous to humans  scientists are now researching the use of spider venom in medicine and as non polluting pesticides  Spider silk provides a combination of lightness  strength and elasticity that is superior to that of synthetic materials  and spider silk genes have been inserted into mammals and plants to see if these can be used as silk factories  As a result of their wide range of behaviors  spiders have become common symbols in art and mythology symbolizing various combinations of patience  cruelty and creative

segmented bodies with jointed limbs  all covered in a cuticle made of chitin and proteins  heads that are composed of several segments that fuse during the development of the embryo  5  Being chelicerates  their bodies consist of two tagmata  sets of segments that serve similar functions  the foremost one  called the cephalothorax or prosoma  is a complete fusion of the segments that in an insect would form two separate tagmata  the head and thorax  the rear tagma is called the abdomen or opisthosoma  6  In spiders the cephalothorax and abdomen are connected by a small cylindrical section  the pedicel  7  The pattern of segment fusion that forms chelicerates  heads is unique among arthropods  and what would normally be the first head segment disappears at an early stage of development  so that chelicerates lack the antennae typical of most arthropods  In fact chelicerates  only appendages ahead of the mouth are a pair of chelicerae  and they lack anything that would function directly as  jaws   5  8  The first appendages behind the mouth are called pedipalps  and serve different functions within different groups of chelicerates  6  Phidippus audax  jumping spider  The basal parts of the chelicerae are the two iridescent green mouthparts  Spiders and scorpions are members of one chelicerate group  the arachnids  8  Scorpions  chelicerae have three sections and are used in feeding  9  Spiders  chelicerae have two sections and terminate in fangs that are generally venomous  and fold away behind the upper sections while not in use  The upper sections generally have thick  beards  that filter solid lumps out of their food  as spiders can take only liquid food  7  Scorpions  pedipalps generally form large claws for capturing prey  9  while those of spiders are fairly small appendages whose bases also act as an extension of the mouth  in addition those of male spiders have enlarged last sections used for sperm transfer  7  In spiders the cephalothorax and abdomen are joined by a small  cylindrical pedicel  which enables the abdomen to move independently when producing silk  The upper surface of the cephalothorax is covered by a single  convex carapace while the underside is covered by two rather flat plates  The abdomen is soft and egg shaped  It shows no sign of segmentation  except that the primitive Mesothelae  whose living members are the Liphistiidae  have segmented plates on the upper surface  7  Circulation and respiration     Nervous system     Digestive  amp  excretory system     Circulatory system     Respiratory system

is reduced to small areas round the reproductive and excretory systems  Its place is largely taken by a hemocoel  a cavity that runs most of the length of the body and through which blood flows  The heart is a tube in the upper part of the body  with a few ostia that act as non return valves allowing blood to enter the heart from the hemocoel but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front end  11  However  in spiders it occupies only the upper part of the abdomen  and blood is discharged into the hemocoel by one artery that opens at the rear end of the abdomen and by branching arteries that pass through the pedicle and open into several parts of the cephalothorax  Hence spiders have open circulatory systems  7  The blood of many spiders that have book lungs contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin to make oxygen transport more efficient  8  Spiders have developed several different respiratory anatomies  based on book lungs  a tracheal system  or both  Mygalomorph and Mesothelae spiders have two pairs of book lungs filled with haemolymph  where openings on the ventral surface of the abdomen allow air to enter and diffuse oxygen  This is also the case for some basal araneomorph spiders like the family Hypochilidae  but the remaining members of this group have just the anterior pair of book lungs intact while the posterior pair of breathing organs are partly or fully modified into tracheae  through which oxygen is diffused into the haemolymph or directly to the tissue and organs  7  The trachea system has most likely evolved in small ancestors to help resist desiccation  8  The trachea were originally connected to the surroundings through a pair of openings called spiracles  but in the majority of spiders this pair of spiracles has fused into a single one in the middle  and moved backwards close to the spinnerets  7  Spiders that have tracheae generally have higher metabolic rates and better water conservation  12  Feeding  digestion and excretion Cheiracanthium punctorium  displaying fangs Uniquely among chelicerates  the final sections of spiders  chelicerae are fangs  and the great majority of spiders can use them to inject venom into prey from venom glands in the roots of the chelicerae  7  The family Uloboridae has lost its poison glands  and is killing the prey with silk instead  Like most arachnids including scorpions  8  spiders have a narrow gut that can only cope with liquid food and spiders have two sets of filters to keep solids out  7  They use one of two different systems of external digestion  Some pump digestive enzymes from the midgut into the prey and then suck the liquified tissues of the prey into the gut  eventually leaving behind the empty husk of the prey  Others grind the prey to pulp using the chelicerae and the bases of the pedipalps  while flooding it with enzymes  in these species the chelicerae and the bases of the pedipalps form a preoral cavity that holds the food they are processing  7  The stomach in the cephalothorax acts as a pump that sends the food deeper into the digestive system  The mid gut bears many digestive ceca  compartments with no other exit  that extract nutrients from the food  most are in the abdomen  which is dominated by the digestive system  but a few are found in the cephalothorax  7  Most spiders convert nitrogenous waste products into uric acid  which can be excreted as a dry material  Malphigian tubules   little tubes   extract these wastes from the blood in the hemocoel and dump them into the cloacal chamber  from which they are expelled through the anus  7  Production of uric acid and its removal via Malphigian tubules are a water conserving feature that has evolved independently in several arthropod lineages that can live far away from water  13  for example the tubules of insects and arachnids develop from completely different parts of the embryo  8  However a few primitive spiders  the sub order Mesothelae and infra order Mygalomorphae  retain the ancestral arthropod nephridia   little kidneys    7  which use large amounts of water to excrete nitrogenous waste products as ammonia  13  Central nervous system The basic arthropod central nervous system consists of a pair of nerve cords running below the gut  with paired ganglia as local control centers in all segments  a brain formed by fusion of the ganglia for the head segments ahead of and behind the mouth  so that the esophagus is encircled by this conglomeration of ganglia  14  Except for the primitive Mesothelae  of which the Liphistiidae are the sole surviving family  spiders have the much more centralized nervous system that is typical of arachnids  all the ganglia of all segments behind the esophagus are fused  so that the cephalothorax is largely filled with nervous tissue and there are no ganglia in the abdomen  7  8  14  in the Mesothelae  the ganglia of the abdomen and the rear part of the cephalothorax remain unfused  12  Sense organs Eyes This jumping spider s main ocelli  center pair  are very acute  The outer pair are  secondary eyes  and there are other pairs of secondary eyes on the sides and top of its head  15  Most spiders have four pairs of eyes on the top front area of the cephalothorax  arranged in patterns that vary from one family to another  7  The pair at the front are of the type called pigment cup ocelli   little eyes    which in most arthropods are only capable of detecting the direction from which light is coming  using the shadow cast by the walls of the cup  However the main eyes at the front of spiders  heads are pigment cup ocelli that are capable of forming images  15  16  The other eyes are thought to be derived from the compound eyes of the ancestral chelicerates  but no longer have the separate facets typical of compound eyes  Unlike the main eyes  in many spiders these secondary eyes detect light reflected from a reflective tapetum lucidum  and wolf spiders can be spotted by torch light reflected from the tapeta  On the other hand jumping spiders  secondary eyes have no tapeta  7  Jumping spiders  visual acuity exceeds by a factor of ten that of dragonflies  which have by far the best vision among insects  in fact the human eye is only about five times sharper than a jumping spider s  They achieve this by a telephoto like series of lenses  a four layer retina and the ability to swivel their eyes and integrate images from different stages in the scan  The downside is that the scanning and integrating processes are relatively slow  17  Other senses As with other arthropods  spiders  cuticles would block out information about the outside world  except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system  In fact spiders and other arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors  Various touch sensors  mostly bristles called setae  respond to different levels of force  from strong contact to very weak air currents  Chemical sensors provide equivalents of taste and smell  often by means of setae  15  Spiders also have in the joints of their limbs slit sensillae that detect forces and vibrations  In web building spiders all these mechanical and chemical sensors are more important than the eyes  while the eyes are most important to spiders that hunt actively  7  Like most arthropods  spiders lack balance and acceleration sensors and rely on their eyes to tell them which way is up  Arthropods  proprioceptors  sensors that report the force exerted by muscles and the degree of bending in the body and joints  are well understood  On the other hand little is known about what other internal sensors spiders or other arthropods may have  15  Locomotion Although all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex their limbs  spiders and a few other groups still use hydraulic pressure to extend them  a system inherited from their pre arthropod ancestors  18  As a result a spider with a punctured cephalothorax cannot extend its legs  and the legs of dead spiders curl up  7  Spiders can generate pressures up to eight times their resting level to extend their legs  19  and jumping spiders can jump up to 50 times their own length by suddenly increasing the blood pressure in the third or fourth pair of legs  7  Most spiders that hunt actively  rather than relying on webs  have dense tufts of fine hairs between the paired claws at the tips of their legs  These tufts  known as scopulae  consist of bristles whose ends are split into as many as 1 000 branches  and enable spiders with scopulae to walk up vertical glass and upside down on ceilings  It appears that scopulae get their grip from contact with extremely thin layers of water on surfaces  7  Spiders  like most other arachnids  keep at least four legs on the surface while walking or running  20  Silk production An orb weaver producing silk from its spinnerets The abdomen has no appendages except those that have been modified to form one to four  usually three  pairs of short  movable spinnerets  which emit silk  Each spinneret has many spigots  each of which is connected to one silk gland  There are at least six types of silk gland  each producing a different type of silk  7  Silk is mainly composed of a protein very similar to that used in insect silk  It is initially a liquid  and hardens not by exposure to air but as a result of being drawn out  which changes the internal structure of the protein  21  It is similar in tensile strength to nylon and biological materials such as chitin  collagen and cellulose  but is much more elastic  in other words it can stretch much further before breaking or losing shape  7  Some spiders have a cribellum  a modified spinneret with up to 40 000 spigots  each of which produces a single very fine fiber  The fibers are pulled out by the calamistrum  a comb like set of bristles on the jointed tip of the cribellum  and combined into a composite woolly thread that is very effective in snagging the bristles of insects  The earliest spiders had cribella  which produced the first silk capable of capturing insects  before spiders developed silk coated with sticky droplets  However most modern groups of spiders have lost the cribellum  7  Tarantulas also have silk glands in their feet  22  Even species that do not build webs to catch prey use silk in several ways  as wrappers for sperm and for fertilized eggs  as a  safety rope   for nest building  and as  parachutes  by the young of some species  7  Reproduction and life cycle Further information  Spider cannibalism The tiny male of the Golden orb weaver  Nephila clavipes   near the top of the leaf  is protected from the female by his producing the right vibrations in the web  and may be too small to be worth eating  Spiders reproduce sexually and fertilization is internal but indirect  in other words the sperm is not inserted into the female s body by the male s genitals but by an intermediate stage  Unlike many land living arthropods  23  male spiders do not produce ready made spermatophores  packages of sperm  but spin small sperm webs on to which they ejaculate and then transfer the sperm to syringe like structures on the tips of their pedipalps  When a male detects signs of a female nearby he checks whether she is of the same species and whether she is ready to mate  for example in species that produce webs or  safety ropes   the male can identify the species and sex of these objects by  smell   7  Gasteracantha mammosa spiderlings next to their eggs capsule Wolf spider carrying its young in its egg sac  Spiders generally use elaborate courtship rituals to prevent the large females from eating the small males before fertilization  except where the male is so much smaller that he is not worth eating  In web weaving species precise patterns of vibrations in the web are a major part of the rituals  while patterns of touches on the female s body are important in many spiders that hunt actively  and may  hypnotize  the female  Gestures and dances by the male are important for jumping spiders  which have excellent eyesight  If courtship is successful  the male injects his sperm from the pedipalps into the female s genital opening  known as the epigyne  on the underside of her abdomen  Female s reproductive tracts vary from simple tubes to systems that include seminal receptacles in which females store sperm and release it when they are ready  7  Males of the genus Tidarren amputate one of their palps before maturation and enter adult life with one palp only  The palps are 20  of male s body mass in this species  and detaching one of the two improves mobility  In the Yemeni species Tidarren argo  the remaining palp is then torn off by the female  The separated palp remains attached to the female s epigynum for about four hours and apparently continues to function independently  In the meantime the female feeds on the palpless male  24  In over 60  of cases the female of the Australian redback spider kills and eats the male after it inserts its second palp into the female s genital opening  in fact the males co operate by trying to impale themselves on the females  fangs  Observation shows that most male redbacks never get an opportunity to mate  and the  lucky  ones increase the likely number of offspring by ensuring that the females are well fed  25  However males of most species survive a few matings  limited mainly by their short life spans  Some even live for a while in their mates  webs  26  Females lay up to 3 000 eggs in one or more silk egg sacs  7  which maintain a fairly constant humidity level  26  In some species the females die afterwards  but females of other species protect the sacs by attaching them to their webs  hiding them in nests  carrying them in the chelicerae or attaching them to the spinnerets and dragging them along  7  Baby spiders pass all their larval stages inside the egg and hatch as spiderlings  very small and sexually immature but similar in shape to adults  Some spiders care for their young  for example a wolf spider s brood cling to rough bristles on the mother s back  7  and females of some species respond to the  begging  behaviour of their young by giving them their prey  provided it is no longer struggling  or even regurgitate food  26  Like other arthropods  spiders have to molt to grow as their cuticle   skin   cannot stretch  27  In some species males mate with newly molted females  which are too weak to be dangerous to the males  26  Most spiders live for only one to two years  although some tarantulas can live in captivity for over 20 years  7  28  Goliath birdeater  Theraphosa blondi   the largest spider  next to a ruler  Size Spiders occur in a large range of sizes  The smallest  Patu digua from Colombia  are less than 0 37 mm  0 015 in  in body length  The largest and heaviest spiders occur among tarantulas  which can have body lengths up to 90 mm  3 5 in  and leg spans up to 250 mm  10 in   29  Coloration Only three classes of pigment  ommochromes  bilins and guanine  have been identified in spiders  although other pigments have been detected but not yet characterized  Melanins  carotenoids and pterins  very common in other animals  are apparently absent  In some species the exocuticle of the legs and prosoma is modified by a tanning process  resulting in brown coloration  30  Bilins are found  for example  in Micrommata virescens  resulting in its green color  Guanine is responsible for the white markings of the European garden spider Araneus diadematus  It is in many species accumulated in specialized cells called guanocytes  In genera such as Tetragnatha  Leucauge  Argyrodes or Theridiosoma  guanine creates their silvery appearance  While guanine is originally an end product of protein metabolism  its excretion can be blocked in spiders  leading to an increase in its storage  30  Structural colors occur in some species  which are the result of the diffraction  scattering or interference of light  for example by modified setae or scales  The white prosoma of Argiope results from hairs reflecting the light  Lycosa and Josa both have areas of modified cuticle that act as light reflectors  30  Ecology and behavior Non predatory feeding Although spiders are generally regarded as predatory  the jumping spider Bagheera kiplingi gets over 90  of its food from fairly solid plant material produced by acacias as part of a mutually beneficial relationship with a species of ant  31  Juveniles of some spiders in the families Anyphaenidae  Corinnidae  Clubionidae  Thomisidae and Salticidae feed on plant nectar  Laboratory studies show that they do so deliberately and over extended periods  and periodically clean themselves while feeding  These spiders also prefer sugar solutions to plain water  which indicates that they are seeking nutrients  Since many spiders are nocturnal  the extent of nectar consumption by spiders may have been under estimated  Nectar contains amino acids  lipids  vitamins and minerals in addition to sugars  and studies have shown that other spider species live longer when nectar is available  Feeding on nectar avoids the risks of struggles with prey  and the costs of producing venom and digestive enzymes  32  Various species are known to feed on dead arthropods  scavenging   web silk  and their own shed exoskeletons  Pollen caught in webs may also be eaten  and studies have shown that young spiders have a better chance of survival if they have the opportunity to eat pollen  In captivity  several spider species are also known to feed on bananas  marmalade  milk  egg yolk and sausages  32  Methods of capturing prey Main article  Spider web The Phonognatha graeffei or leaf curling spider s web serves both as a trap and as a way of making its home in a leaf  The best known method of prey capture is by means of sticky webs  Varying placement of webs allows different species of spider to trap different insects in the same area  for example flat horizontal webs trap insects that fly up from vegetation underneath while flat vertical webs trap insects in horizontal flight  Web building spiders have poor vision  but are extremely sensitive to vibrations  7  Females of the water spider Argyroneta aquatica build underwater  diving bell  webs which they fill with air and use for digesting prey  molting  mating and raising offspring  They live almost entirely within the bells  darting out to catch prey animals that touch the bell or the threads that anchor it  33  A few spiders use the surfaces of lakes and ponds as  webs   detecting trapped insects by the vibrations that these cause while struggling  7  Net casting spiders weave only small webs but then manipulate them to trap prey  Those of the genus Hyptiotes and the family Theridiosomatidae stretch their webs and then release them when prey strike them  but do not actively move their webs  Those of the family Deinopidae weave even smaller webs  hold them outstretched between their first two pairs of legs  and lunge and push the webs as much as twice their own body length to trap prey  and this move may increase the webs  area by a factor of up to ten  Experiments have shown that Deinopis spinosus has two different techniques for trapping prey  backwards strikes to catch flying insects  whose vibrations it detects  and forward strikes to catch ground walking prey that it sees  These two techniques have also been observed in other deinopids  Walking insects form most of the prey of most deinopids  but one population of Deinopis subrufa appears to live mainly on tipulid flies that they catch with the backwards strike  34  Mature female bolas spiders of the genus Mastophora build  webs  that consist of only a single  trapeze line   which they patrol  They also construct a bolas made of a single thread  tipped with a large ball of very wet sticky silk  They emit chemicals that resemble the pheromones of moths  and then swing the bolas at the moths  Although they miss on about 50  of strikes  they catch about the same weight of insects per night as web weaving spiders of similar size  The spiders eat the bolas if they have not made a kill in about 30 minutes  rest for a while  and then make new bolas  35  36  Juveniles and adult males are much smaller and do not make bolas  Instead they release different pheromones that attract moth flies  and catch them with their front pairs of legs  37  Trapdoor spider  family  Ctenizidae   an ambush predator  The primitive Liphistiidae  the  trapdoor spiders   family Ctenizidae  and many tarantulas are ambush predators that lurk in burrows  often closed by trapdoors and often surrounded by networks of silk threads that alert these spiders to the presence of prey  12  Other ambush predators do without such aids  including many crab spiders  7  and a few species that prey on bees  which see ultraviolet  can adjust their ultraviolet reflectance to match the flowers in which they are lurking  30 Wolf spiders  jumping spiders  fishing spiders and some crab spiders capture prey by chasing it  and rely mainly on vision to locate prey  7  Portia uses both webs and cunning  versatile tactics to overcome prey  38  Some jumping spiders of the genus Portia hunt other spiders in ways that seem intelligent  17  outflanking their victims or luring them from their webs  Laboratory studies show that Portia s instinctive tactics are only starting points for a trial and error approach from which these spiders learn very quickly how to overcome new prey species  38  However they seem to be relatively slow  thinkers   which is not surprising  as their brains are vastly smaller than those of mammalian predators  17  An ant mimicking jumping spider Ant mimicking spiders face several challenges  they generally develop slimmer abdomens and false  waists  in the cephalothorax to mimic the three distinct regions  tagmata  of an ant s body  they wave the first pair of legs in form to their heads to mimic antennae  which spiders lack  and to conceal the fact that they have eight legs rather than six  they develop large color patches round one pair of eyes to disguise the fact that they generally have eight simple eyes  while ants have two compound eyes  they cover their bodies with reflective hairs to resemble the shiny bodies of ants  In some spider species  males and females mimic different ant species  as female spiders are usually much larger than males  Ant mimicking spiders also modify their behavior to resemble that of the target species of ant  for example  many adopt a zig zag pattern of movement  ant mimicking jumping spiders avoid jumping  and spiders of the genus Synemosyna walk on the outer edges of leaves in the same way as Pseudomyrmex  Ant mimicry in many spiders and other arthropods may be for protection from predators that hunt by sight  including birds  lizards and spiders  However  several ant mimicking spiders prey either on ants or on the ants   livestock   such as aphids  When at rest  the ant mimicking crab spider Amyciaea does not closely resemble Oecophylla  but while hunting it imitates the behavior of a dying ant to attract worker ants  After a kill  some ant mimicking spiders hold their victims between themselves and large groups of ants to avoid being attacked  39  Defense Threat display by a Sydney funnel web spider  Atrax robustus   There is strong evidence that spiders  coloration is camouflage that helps them to evade their major predators  birds and parasitic wasps  both of which have good color vision  Many spider species are colored so as to merge with their most common backgrounds  and some have disruptive coloration  stripes and blotches that break up their outlines  In a few species  such as the Hawaiian happy face spider  Theridion grallator  several coloration schemes are present in a ratio that appears to remain constant  and this may make it more difficult for predators to recognize the species  Most spiders are insufficiently dangerous or unpleasant tasting for warning coloration to offer much benefit  However a few species with powerful venoms  large jaws or irritant hairs have patches of warning colors  and some actively display these colors when threatened  30  40  Many of the family Theraphosidae  which includes tarantulas and baboon spiders  have urticating hairs on their abdomens and use their legs to flick them at attackers  These hairs are fine setae  bristles  with fragile bases and a row of barbs on the tip  The barbs cause intense irritation but there is no evidence that they carry any kind of venom  41  A few defend themselves against wasps by including networks of very robust threads in their webs  giving the spider time to flee while the wasps are struggling with the obstacles  42  The golden wheeling spider  Carparachne aureoflava  of the Namibian desert escapes parasitic wasps by flipping onto its side and cartwheeling down sand dunes  43  Social spiders Main article  Social spider A few species of spiders that build webs live together in large colonies and show social behavior  although not as complex as in social insects  Anelosimus eximius  in the family Theridiidae  can form colonies of up to 50 000 individuals  44  The genus Anelosimus has a strong tendency towards sociality  all known American species are social  and species in Madagascar are at least somewhat social  45  Members of other species in the same family but several different genera have independently developed social behavior  For example  although Theridion nigroannulatum belongs to a genus with no other social species  T  nigroannulatum build colonies that may contain several thousand individuals that co operate in prey capture and share food  46  Other communal spiders include several Philoponella species  family Uloboridae   Agelena consociata  family Agelenidae  and Mallos gregalis  family Dictynidae   47  Social predatory spiders need to defend their prey against kleptoparasites   thieves    and larger colonies are more successful in this  48  The herbivorous spider Bagheera kiplingi lives in small colonies which help to protect eggs and spiderlings  31  Even widow spiders  genus Latrodectus   which are notoriously aggressive and cannibalistic  have formed small colonies in captivity  sharing webs and feeding together  49  Web types The large orb web of Araneus diadematus  European garden spider   Main article  Spider web There is no consistent relationship between the classification of spiders and the types of web they build  species in the same genera may build very similar or significantly different webs  Nor is there much correspondence between spiders  classification and the chemical composition of their silks  Convergent evolution in web construction  in other words use of similar techniques by remotely related species  is rampant  Non orb web designs and the spinning behaviors that produce them have received very little attention from arachnologists  despite the fact that the majority of spiders build non orb webs  The basic radial then spiral sequence visible in orb webs and the sense of direction required to build them may have been inherited from the common ancestors of most spider groups  50  It used to be thought that the sticky orb web was an evolutionary innovation resulting in the diversification of the Orbiculariae  Now  however  it appears that non orb spiders are a sub group that evolved from orb web spiders  and non orb spiders have over 40  more species and are four times as abundant as orb web spiders  Their greater success may be because sphecid wasps  which are often the dominant predators on spiders  much prefer to attack spiders that have flat webs  51  Orb webs Nephila clavata  a golden orb weaver About half the potential prey that hit orb webs escape  A web has to perform three functions  intercepting the prey  intersection   absorbing its momentum without breaking  stopping   and trapping the prey by entangling it or sticking to it  retention   No single design is best for all prey  For example  wider spacing of lines will increase the web s area and hence its ability to intercept prey  but reduce its stopping power and retention  closer spacing  larger sticky droplets and thicker lines would improve retention  but would make it easier for potential prey to see and avoid the web  at least during the day  However there are no consistent differences between orb webs built for use during the day and those built for use at night  In fact there is no simple relationship between orb web design features and the prey they capture  as each orb weaving species takes a wide range of prey  50  The hubs of orb webs  where the spiders lurk  are usually above the center as the spiders can move downwards faster than upwards  If there is an obvious direction in which the spider can retreat to avoid its own predators  the hub is usually offset towards that direction  50  Horizontal orb webs are fairly common  despite being less effective at intercepting and retaining prey and more vulnerable to damage by rain and falling debris  Various researchers have suggested that horizontal webs offer compensating advantages  such as  reduced vulnerability to wind damage  reduced visibility to prey flying upwards  because of the back lighting from the sky  enabling oscillations to catch insects in slow horizontal flight  However there is no single explanation for the common use of horizontal orb webs  50  Spiders often attach highly visible silk bands called decorations or stabilimenta to their webs  Field research suggests that webs with more decorative bands captured more prey per hour  52  However a laboratory study showed that spiders reduce the building of these decorations if they sense the presence of predators  53  There are several unusual variants of orb web  many of them convergently evolved  including  attachment of lines to the surface of water  possibly to trap insects in or on the surface  webs with twigs through their centers  possibly to hide the spiders from predators   ladder like  webs that appear most effective in catching moths  However the significance of many variations is unclear  50  In 1973  Skylab 3 took two orb web spiders into space to test their web spinning capabilities in zero gravity  At first both produced rather sloppy webs  but they adapted quickly  54  Tangleweb spiders  cobweb spiders  A funnel web  Members of the family Theridiidae weave irregular  tangled  three dimensional webs  popularly known as cobwebs There seems to be an evolutionary trend towards a reduction in the amount of sticky silk used  leading to its total absence in some species  The construction of cobwebs is less stereotyped than that of orb webs  and may take several days  51  Other types of webs The Linyphiidae generally make horizontal but uneven sheets  with tangles of stopping threads above  Insects that hit the stopping threads fall on to the sheet or are shaken on to it by the spider  and are held by sticky threads on the sheet until the spider can attack from below  55  Evolution Main article  Spider evolution Fossil record Spider preserved in amber Although the fossil record of spiders is considered poor  56  almost 1000 species have been described from fossils  57  Because spiders  bodies are quite soft  the vast majority of fossil spiders have been found preserved in amber  57  The oldest known amber that contains fossil arthropods dates from 130 million years ago in the Early Cretaceous period  In addition to preserving spiders  anatomy in very fine detail  pieces of amber show spiders mating  killing prey  producing silk and possibly caring for their young  In a few cases amber has preserved spiders  egg sacs and webs  occasionally with prey attached  58  the oldest fossil web found so far is 100 million years old  59  Earlier spider fossils come from a few lagerst tten  places where conditions were exceptionally suited to preserving fairly soft tissues  58  Palaeotarbus jerami  a trigonotarbid and the oldest known arachnid The oldest known arachnid is the trigonotarbid Palaeotarbus jerami  from about 420 million years ago in the Silurian period  and had a triangular cephalothorax and segmented abdomen  as well as eight legs and a pair of pedipalps  60 Attercopus fimbriunguis  from 386 million years ago in the Devonian period  bears the earliest known silk producing spigots  and was therefore hailed as a spider  61  However these spigots may have been mounted on the underside of the abdomen rather than on spinnerets  which are modified appendages and whose mobility is important in the building of webs  Hence Attercopus and the similar Permian arachnid Permarachne may not have been true spiders  and probably used silk for lining nests or producing egg cases rather than for building webs  62  The largest known fossil spider as of 2011 is the araneid Nephila jurassica  from about 165 million years ago  recorded from Daohuogo  Inner Mongolia in China  63  Several Carboniferous spiders were members of the Mesothelae  a primitive group now represented only by the Liphistiidae  61  The mesothelid Paleothele montceauensis  from the Late Carboniferous over 299 million years ago  had five spinnerets  64  Although the Permian period 299 to 251 million years ago saw rapid diversification of flying insects  there are very few fossil spiders from this period  61  The main groups of modern spiders  Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae  first appear in the Triassic well before 200 million years ago  Some Triassic mygalomorphs appear to be members of the family Hexathelidae  whose modern members include the notorious Sydney funnel web spider  and their spinnerets appear adapted for building funnel shaped webs to catch jumping insects  Araneomorphae account for the great majority of modern spiders  including those that weave the familiar orb shaped webs  The Jurassic and Cretaceous periods provide a large number of fossil spiders  including representatives of many modern families  61  Family tree Chelicerata Xiphosura

65      marks extinct groups  It is now agreed that spiders  Araneae  are monophyletic  i e   members of a group of organisms which form a clade  consisting of a last common ancestor and all of its descendants   66  There has been debate about what their closest evolutionary relatives are  and how all of these evolved from the ancestral chelicerates  which were marine animals  The cladogram on the right is based on J W  Shultz  analysis  2007   Other views include proposals that  scorpions are more closely related to the extinct marine scorpion like eurypterids than to spiders  spiders and Amblypygi are a monophyletic group  The appearance of several multi way branchings in the tree on the right shows that there are still uncertainties about relationships between the groups involved  66  Arachnids lack some features of other chelicerates  including backward pointing mouths and gnathobases   jaw bases   at the bases of their legs  66  both of these features are part of the ancestral arthropod feeding system  67  Instead they have mouths that point forwards and downwards  and all have some means of breathing air  66  Spiders  Araneae  are distinguished from other arachnid groups by several characteristics  including spinnerets and  in males  pedipalps that are specially adapted for sperm transfer  68  Taxonomy Main articles  Spider taxonomy and List of families of spiders Spiders are divided into two sub orders  Mesothelae and Opisthothelae  of which the latter contains two infra orders  Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae  Over 40 000 living species of spiders  order Araneae  have been identified and are currently grouped into about 110 families and about 3 700 genera by arachnologists  2  68    Spider diversity 2  68  Features Sub order Species Genera Families Segmented plates on top of abdomen 69  Ganglia in abdomen Spinnerets 69  Striking direction of fangs 7  Mesothelae 87 5 1 Yes Yes Four pairs  in some species one pair fused  under middle of abdomen Downwards and forwards Mygalomorphae 2 600 300 15 No  but yes in some fossils No One  two or three pairs under rear of abdomen Araneomorphae 37 000 3 400 93 From sides to center  like pincers Mesothelae Ryuthela secundaria  a member of the Liphistiidae 70  Main article  Mesothelae The only living members of the primitive Mesothelae are the family Liphistiidae  found only in Southeast Asia  China  and Japan  68  Most of the Liphistiidae construct silk lined burrows with thin trapdoors  although some species of the genus Liphistius build camouflaged silk tubes with a second trapdoor as an emergency exit  Members of the genus Liphistius run silk  tripwires  outwards from their tunnels to help them detect approaching prey  while those of genus Heptathela do not and instead rely on their built in vibration sensors  71  Spiders of the genus Heptathela have no venom glands although they do have venom gland outlets on the fang tip  72  The extinct families Arthrolycosidae  found in Carboniferous and Permian rocks  and Arthromygalidae  so far found only in Carboniferous rocks  have been classified as members of the Mesothelae  73  Mygalomorphae A Mexican red kneed tarantula Brachypelma smithi Main article  Mygalomorphae The Mygalomorphae  which first appeared in the Triassic period  61  are generally heavily built and hairy  with large  robust chelicerae and fangs  68  Well known examples include tarantulas  trapdoor spiders and the Australasian funnel web spiders  7  Most spend the majority of their time in burrows  and some run silk tripwires out from these  but a few build webs to capture prey  However mygalomorphs cannot produce the pirifom silk that the Araneomorphae use as instant adhesive to glue silk to surfaces or to other strands of silk  and this makes web construction more difficult for mygalomorphs  Since mygalomorphs rarely  balloon  by using air currents for transport  their populations often form clumps  68  In addition to arthropods  mygalomorphs prey on frogs and lizards  and snails  74  Araneomorphae Leucauge venusta  an orb web spider Main article  Araneomorphae In addition to accounting for over 90  of spider species  the Araneomorphae  also known as the  true spiders   include orb web spiders  the cursorial wolf spiders  and jumping spiders  68  as well as the only known herbivorous spider  Bagheera kiplingi  31  They are distinguished by having fangs that oppose each other and cross in a pinching action  in contrast to the Mygalomorphae  which have fangs that are nearly parallel in alignment  75  Spiders and people Spider bites Main article  Spider bite Symptoms that are most common in toxic spider bites 76  Most spiders will only bite humans in self defense  and few produce worse effects than a mosquito bite or bee sting  77  Most of those with medically serious bites  such as recluse spiders and widow spiders  are shy and bite only when they feel threatened  although this can easily arise by accident  78  79 Funnel web spiders  defensive tactics are aggressive and their venom  although they rarely inject much  has resulted in 13 known human deaths  80  On the other hand  the Brazilian wandering spider requires very little provocation  81  There were about 100 reliably reported deaths from spider bites in the 20th century  82  but about 1 500 from jellyfish stings  83  Many alleged cases of spider bites may represent incorrect diagnoses  84  which would make it more difficult to check the effectiveness of treatments for genuine bites  85  Benefits to humans Cooked tarantula spiders are considered a delicacy in Cambodia  Cooked tarantula spiders are considered a delicacy in Cambodia  86  and by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela   provided the highly irritant hairs  the spiders  main defense system  are removed first  87  Spider venoms may be a less polluting alternative to conventional pesticides as they are deadly to insects but the great majority are harmless to vertebrates  Australian funnel web spiders are a promising source as most of the world s insect pests have had no opportunity to develop any immunity to their venom  and funnel web spiders thrive in captivity and are easy to  milk   It may be possible to target specific pests by engineering genes for the production of spider toxins into viruses that infect species such as cotton bollworms  88  Possible medical uses for spider venoms are being investigated  for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia  89 Alzheimer s disease  90 strokes  91  and erectile dysfunction  92  Because spider silk is both light and very strong  attempts are being made to produce it in goats  milk and in the leaves of plants  by means of genetic engineering  93  94  Fine transparent spider silk fibers are used by physicists  working on optical communications  to introduce minute diffraction patterns over propagating N slit interferometric signals  95  Arachnophobia Main article  Arachnophobia Arachnophobia is a specific phobia it is the abnormal fear of spiders or anything reminiscent of spiders  such as webs or spider like shapes  It is one of the most common specific phobias  96  97  and some statistics show that 50  of women and 10  of men show symptoms  98  It may be an exaggerated form of an instinctive response that helped early humans to survive  99  or a cultural phenomenon that is most common in predominantly European societies  100  Spiders in symbolism and culture Main article  Cultural depictions of spiders This Moche ceramic depicts a spider  and dates from around 300 CE  Spiders have been the focus of fears  stories and mythologies of various cultures for centuries  101  They have symbolized patience due to their hunting technique of setting webs and waiting for prey  as well as mischief and malice for the painful death their venom causes  102  Web spinning also caused the association of the spider with creation myths as they seem to have the ability to produce their own worlds  103  The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped nature  104  They placed emphasis on animals and often depicted spiders in their art  105  See also Arthropods portal Endangered spiders
