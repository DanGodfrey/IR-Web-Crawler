Discrimination portal v t e Lynching is an extrajudicial execution carried out by a mob  often by hanging  but also by burning at the stake or shooting  in order to punish an alleged transgressor  or to intimidate  control  or otherwise manipulate a population of people  It is related to other means of social control that arise in communities  such as charivari  riding the rail  and tarring and feathering  Lynchings have been more frequent in times of social and economic tension  and have often been the means used by the politically dominant population to oppress social challengers  Violence in the United States against African Americans  especially in the South  rose in the aftermath of the Civil War  after slavery had been abolished and recently freed black men were given the right to vote  Violence rose even more at the end of the century  after southern white Democrats regained their political power in the South in the 1870s  States passed new constitutions or legislation which effectively disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites  established segregation of public facilities by race  and separated blacks from common public life and facilities  Nearly 3 500 African Americans were lynched in the United States between 1882 and 1968  mostly from 1882 to 1920  1  Lynching during the 19th century in the United States  Britain and colonies  coincided with a period of violence which denied people participation in white dominated society on the basis of race or gender after the Emancipation Act of 1833  2  Today lynching is a felony in all states of the United States  defined by some codes of law as  Any act of violence inflicted by a mob upon the body of another person which results in the death of the person   with a  mob  being defined as  the assemblage of two or more persons  without color or authority of law  for the premeditated purpose and with the premeditated intent of committing an act of violence upon the person of another   Lynching in the second degree is defined as  Any act of violence inflicted by a mob upon the body of another person and from which death does not result   3  To sustain a conviction for lynching  at least some evidence of premeditation must be produced  but  The common intent to do violence  may be formed before or during the assemblage   4  Contents 1 Etymology 2 United States 2 1 Dyer Bill 2 2 Thomas

is traditionally attributed to a Virginia Quaker named Charles Lynch  5  Charles Lynch  1736 1796   a Virginia planter and American Revolutionary who headed a county court in Virginia which incarcerated Loyalist supporters of the British for up to one year during the war  although lacking proper jurisdiction  on the plea of wartime necessity  Subsequently  he prevailed upon his friends in the Congress of the Confederation to pass a law which specifically exonerated him and his associates from wrongdoing  He was concerned that he might face legal action from one or more of those so incarcerated  notwithstanding that the American Colonies had won the war  This move by the Congress provoked controversy  and it was in connection with this that the term  Lynch law   meaning the assumption of extrajudicial authority  came into common parlance in the United States  It should be noted that Judge Lynch was never accused of racist bias  and indeed acquitted blacks accused of murder on three separate occasions  as dictated by the facts brought before him  6  7  The following are several improbable suggested sources of the word s origin  William Lynch  1742 1820  from Virginia claimed that the phrase was first used for a 1780 compact signed by him and his neighbors in Pittsylvania County  James Lynch Fitzstephen from Galway  Ireland  who was the Mayor of Galway when he hanged his own son from the balcony of his house after convicting him of the murder of a Spanish visitor in 1493  8  9  Lingchi  a Chinese form of execution used from roughly AD 900 to 1905  10  Archaic verb linch  to beat severely with a pliable instrument  to chastise or to maltreat  5   edit  United States Main article  Lynching in the United States The lynching of Laura Nelson in Okemah  Oklahoma on May 25  1911  she had tried to protect her son  who was lynched together with her  11  Lynching  as a form of punishment for presumed criminal offenses  performed by self appointed commissions  mobs  or vigilantes without due process of law took place in the United States before the American Civil War and afterwards  from southern states to western frontier settlements  The term  Lynch s Law   and subsequently  lynch law  and  lynching   apparently originated during the American Revolution when Charles Lynch  a Virginia justice of the peace  ordered extralegal punishment for Tory acts  In the South  members of the abolitionist movement or other people opposing slavery were usually targets of lynch mob violence before the Civil War  During the war  Southern Home Guard units sometimes lynched white Southerners whom they suspected of being Unionists or deserters  one example of this was the hanging of Methodist minister Bill Sketoe in the south Alabama town of Newton in December 1864  After the war  southern whites struggled to maintain social dominance  Secret vigilante and insurgent groups such as the Ku Klux Klan  KKK  instigated extrajudicial assaults and killings to keep power and to discourage freedmen from voting  working and getting educated  They also sometimes attacked Northerners  teachers  and agents of the Freedmen s Bureau  A study of the period of 1868 to 1871 estimates that the KKK was involved in more than 400 lynchings  The aftermath of the war was a period of upheaval and social turmoil  in which most of the white men had been war veterans  Mobs usually had alleged crimes for which they lynched blacks  In the late 19th century  however  journalist Ida B  Wells showed that many presumed crimes were exaggerated or did not occur  12  Not all lynchings in the United States were targeted against African Americans  Between 1882 and 1968  the Tuskegee Institute recorded 1 297 lynchings of whites as well as the 3 446 lynchings of African Americans during that period  1  13  By the 1890s and after the turn of the century  the vast majority of those lynched were Black people  14  including at least 159 women  15  Lynchings of other minority members  such as Mexicans and Chinese  have been shown to have been undercounted in the Tuskegee Institute s records  16  Mob violence arose as a means of enforcing white supremacy and verged on systematic political terrorism   The Ku Klux Klan  paramilitary groups  and other whites united by frustration and anger ruthlessly defended the interests of white supremacy  The magnitude of extralegal violence during election campaigns reached epidemic proportions  leading the historian William Gillette to label it guerrilla warfare   17  18  19  20  21  During Reconstruction  the Ku Klux Klan and others used lynching as a means to control African Americans  forcing them to work for planters and preventing them from exercising their right to vote  17  18  19  20  21  Federal troops and courts enforcing the Civil Rights Act of 1871 largely broke up the Reconstruction era Klan  By the end of Reconstruction in 1877  with fraud  intimidation and violence at the polls  white Democrats regained nearly total control of the state legislatures across the South  They passed laws to make voter registration more complicated  reducing black voters on the rolls  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries  from 1890 to 1908  ten of eleven Southern legislatures ratified new constitutions and amendments to effectively disfranchise most African Americans and many poor whites through devices such as poll taxes  property and residency requirements  and literacy tests  Although required of all voters  some provisions were selectively applied against African Americans  In addition  many states passed grandfather clauses to exempt white illiterates from literacy tests for a limited period  The result was that black voters were stripped from registration rolls and without political recourse  Since they could not vote  they could not serve on juries  They were without official political voice  The largest mass lynching in American history involved the lynching of eleven Italian immigrants in New Orleans in 1891  The ideology behind lynching  directly connected with denial of political and social equality  was stated forthrightly by Benjamin Tillman  governor of South Carolina and later a United States Senator  We of the South have never recognized the right of the negro to govern white men  and we never will  We have never believed him to be the equal of the white man  and we will not submit to his gratifying his lust on our wives and daughters without lynching him  22  Lynchings declined briefly after the takeover in the 1870s  By the end of the 19th century  with struggles over labor and disfranchisement  and continuing agricultural depression  lynchings rose again  The number of lynchings peaked at the end of the 19th century  but these kinds of murders continued into the 20th century  Tuskegee Institute records of lynchings between the years 1880 and 1951 show 3 437 African American victims  as well as 1 293 white victims  Lynchings were concentrated in the Cotton Belt   Mississippi  Georgia  Alabama  Texas and Louisiana   23  African Americans resisted through protests  marches  lobbying Congress  writing of articles  rebuttals of so called justifications of lynching  organizing women s groups against lynching  and organizing integrated groups against lynching  African American playwrights produced 14 anti lynching plays between 1916 and 1935  ten of them by women  After the 1915 release of the movie The Birth of a Nation  which glorified lynching and the Reconstruction era Klan  the Klan re formed  Unlike in its earlier form  it was heavily represented among urban populations  especially in the Midwest  In response to massive immigration of people from southern and eastern Europe  the Klan had an anti immigrant  anti Catholic and anti Jewish stance  in addition to exercising oppression of blacks  Members of mobs that participated in lynchings often took photographs of what they had done to spread awareness and fear of their power  Some of those photographs were published and sold as postcards  In 2000  James Allen published a collection of 145 lynching photos in book form and online  24  with written words and video to accompany the images   edit  Dyer Bill The Dyer Anti Lynching Bill was first introduced to United States Congress in 1918 by Republican Congressman Leonidas C  Dyer of Missouri  The bill was passed by the United States House of Representatives in 1922 and in the same year given a favorable report by the United States Senate Committee  Passage was blocked by white Democratic senators from the Solid South  the only representatives elected since southern states disfranchised African Americans at the turn of the century  25  The Dyer Bill influenced later anti lynching legislation  including the Costigan Wagner Bill  26  The Dyer Anti Lynching Bill as it appeared in 1922 stated   To assure to persons within the jurisdiction of every State the equal protection of the laws  and to punish the crime of lynching     Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled  That the phrase  mob or riotous assemblage   when used in this act  shall mean an assemblage composed of three or more persons acting in concert for the purpose of depriving any person of his life without authority of law as a punishment for or to prevent the commission of some actual or supposed public offense   27   edit  Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith  lynched in Marion  Indiana on August 7  1930 Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith  both African Americans  were lynched on August 7  1930 in Marion  Indiana  They had been arrested the night before on charges of robbing and murdering a white factory worker and raping his girlfriend  A large crowd broke into the jail with sledgehammers  beat the men  and hanged them  Police officers in the crowd cooperated in the lynching  A third person  16 year old James Cameron  escaped lynching due to the intervention of an unidentified member of the crowd who announced that he had nothing to do with the rape or murder  28  A studio photographer  Lawrence Beitler  took a photograph of the dead bodies hanging from a tree surrounded by a large crowd  thousands of copies of the photograph were sold  The event is notable as the last confirmed lynching of blacks in the Northern United States  29  30   edit  America s Black Holocaust Museum Main article  America s Black Holocaust Museum The museum s founding date is given in the AP interview article by Sharon Cohen  which appeared in the Standard Times on February 17  2003  and is quoted in the IDS interview  see above  Cameron s position as Founder and Director is also mentioned in the Little review cited earlier and in other sources   edit   Strange Fruit  In 1937 Abel Meeropol  a Jewish schoolteacher from New York  saw a copy of the photograph of the Marion lynching  Meeropol later said that the photograph  haunted me for days  and inspired his writing the poem  Strange Fruit   It was published in the New York Teacher and later in the magazine New Masses  in both cases under the pseudonym Lewis Allan  31  This poem became the lyrics for the song of the same name  also written by Meeropol  performed and popularized by Billie Holiday  32  The song reached 16th place on the charts in July 1939   edit  Decline The frequency of lynching dropped in the 1930s  Lynch law declined sharply by the 1950s  Most but not all lynchings ceased during the 1960s  1  13   edit  Civil rights law The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees persons the right against unreasonable searches or seizures  Under the  color of law   a law enforcement official under certain circumstances is allowed to stop people and search them and retain their property if necessary  Abuse of this discretionary power is a violation of a person s civil rights  Unlawful detention or illegal confiscation of property are examples of such abuse  In deprivation of property  the color of law statute is violated by unlawfully obtaining or maintaining the property of another person  Fabricating evidence or conducting false arrest is a violation of a person s rights of unreasonable seizure and due process  The Fourteenth Amendment of the U S  Constitution secures the right to due process  The Eighth Amendment prohibits the use of cruel and unusual punishment  These rights prohibit the use of force in an arrest or detention context which would amount to punishment or summary judgment and provide that a person accused of a crime is not subject to punishment without legal process and a trial  33  Title 18  U S C   Section 241  is the civil rights conspiracy statute  which makes it unlawful for two or more persons to conspire to injure  oppress  threaten  or intimidate any person of any state  territory  or district in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him her by the Constitution or the laws of the United States   or because of his her having exercised the same  and further makes it unlawful for two or more persons to go in disguise on the highway or premises of another person with intent to prevent or hinder his or her free exercise or enjoyment of such rights  Depending upon the circumstances of the crime  and any resulting injury  the offense is punishable by a range of fines and or imprisonment for any term of years up to life  or the death penalty  34   edit  Europe In Britain  a series of race riots broke out in several cities in 1919 between whites and black sailors  In Liverpool  after a black sailor had been stabbed by two whites in a pub  his friends attacked the pub in revenge  In response  the police raided lodging houses with black occupants  accompanied by an  enraged lynch mob   Charles Wootton  a young black seaman who had not been involved in the attacks  was chased into the river Mersey and drowned after being pelted with missiles thrown by the mob  who chanted  Let him drown   35  The Charles Wootton College in Liverpool was named in his memory  36  In 1944  Wolfgang Rosterg  a German prisoner of war known to be unsympathetic to the Nazi regime  was lynched by Nazis in POW Camp 21 in Comrie  Scotland  After the end of the war five of the perpetrators were hanged at Pentonville Prison   the largest multiple execution in 20th century Britain  37  There are also approximately 150 confirmed cases of surviving crew members of crashed allied aircraft  esp  bombers  being lynched by German civilians  soldiers  policemen or paramilitaries in revenge for what Nazi propagandists termed  Allied terror bombing   Alliierter Bombenterror   This was further promoted by Nazi officials through secret orders that prohibited policemen and soldiers from interfering in favor of the enemy in conflicts between civilians and allies forces  or prosecuting civilians who engaged in such acts  38   edit  Mexico On November 23  2004  in the Tlahuac lynching  39  three Mexican undercover federal agents doing a narcotics investigation were lynched in the town of San Juan Ixtayopan  Mexico City  by an angry crowd who saw them taking photographs and suspected they were trying to abduct children from a primary school  The agents identified themselves immediately but were held and beaten for several hours before two of them were killed and set on fire  The incident was covered by the media almost from the beginning  including their pleas for help and their murder  By the time police rescue units arrived  two of the agents were reduced to charred corpses and the third was seriously injured  Authorities suspect the lynching was provoked by the persons being investigated  Both local and federal authorities abandoned them to their fate  saying the town was too far away to even try to arrive in time and some officials stating they would provoke a massacre if they tried to rescue them from the mob   edit  Guatemala A young Guatemalan woman  Alejandra Maria Torres  was lynched by a mob in Guatemala City on December 15  2009  The mob alleged that Torres had attempted to rob passengers on a bus  Torres was beaten  doused with gasoline  and set on fire  but was able to put the fire out before sustaining life threatening burns  Police intervened and arrested Torres  Torres was forced to go topless throughout the ordeal and subsequent arrest  and many photographs were taken and published  Approximately 219 people were lynched in Guatemala in 2009  of whom 45 died  40   edit  Dominican Republic According to an Amnesty International report  lynchings of Haitians and Dominicans accused of various crimes  ranging from theft to murder  have continued to occur as late as 2006  41   edit  Haiti After the 2010 earthquake slow distribution of relief supplies and the large number of affected people created concerns of civil unrest  marked by looting and mob justice against suspected looters  42  43  44  45  46   edit  South Africa Main article  Necklacing The practice of whipping and necklacing offenders and political opponents evolved in the 1980s during the apartheid era in South Africa  Residents of black townships formed  people s courts  to terrorize fellow blacks who were seen as collaborators of the government using whip lashings and deaths by necklacing  Necklacing is the torture and execution of victims by igniting a kerosene filled rubber tire that has been forced around the victim s chest and arms  Necklacing was used to punish victims  including children  citation needed  who were alleged to be traitors to the black liberation movement and relatives and associates of the offenders  Sometimes the  people s courts  made mistakes  or used the system to punish those to whom leaders were opposed  47  There was tremendous controversy when the practice was endorsed by Winnie Mandela  then the wife of the imprisoned Nelson Mandela and a senior member of the African National Congress  48  Palestinian lynched for collaborating with Israel  1992 More recently  drug dealers and other gang members have been lynched by People Against Gangsterism and Drugs  a Muslim vigilante organization   edit  India Main article  Caste related violence in India In India  lynchings generally reflect tensions between numerous ethnic groups and castes in the country  Typically  lynchings involve upper caste members attacking lower caste members  citation needed  However  recent examples include the Kherlanji massacre  where low castes were lynched by other low castes  India has a large scale affirmative action programme for the emancipation of the lower castes  Sociologists and social scientists reject the identification of caste with racial discrimination and attribute it to intra racial ethno cultural conflict  49   edit  West Bank and Gaza Strip Palestinian lynch mobs have murdered Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel  50  51  52  According to a Human Rights Watch report from 2001  During the first Intifada  before the PA was established  hundreds of alleged collaborators were lynched  tortured or killed  at times with the implied support of the PLO  Street killings of alleged collaborators continue in the current Intifada     but so far in much fewer numbers  53  In the 2000 Ramallah lynching  a Palestinian mob beat to death two Israeli reservists who had entered the city  54  55   edit  See also Extrajudicial punishment Hanging Hate crime
