remainder of its run  7  is an American animated television series that originally aired from November 19  1959 to June 27  1964 on the ABC and NBC television networks  Produced by Jay Ward Productions  the series is structured as a variety show  with the main feature being the serialized adventures of the two title characters  the anthropomorphic moose Bullwinkle and flying squirrel Rocky  The main adversaries in most of their adventures are the Russian like spies Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale  Supporting segments include Dudley Do Right  a parody of old time melodrama   Peabody  amp  Sherman  a dog and his pet boy traveling through time   and Fractured Fairy Tales  classic fairy tales retold in comic fashion   among others  Rocky  amp  Bullwinkle were conceived in the late 1940s by Jay Ward and his partner Alex Anderson  creators of Crusader Rabbit  the first animated program made specifically for television  An unused show idea called The Frostbite Falls Revue featured early versions of the moose and squirrel  Ward took this idea with him when he moved to Los Angeles from Berkeley and hired former UPA animator Bill Scott to help write the show  and voice characters as it turned out   Production on the show began in late 1958 when cereal company General Mills signed on as the primary sponsor  and it premiered November 19 the following year in a late afternoon timeslot  Rocky  amp  Bullwinkle is well known for the quality of its writing and humor  Mixing equal parts puns  cultural and topical satire  and self referential humor  it was designed to appeal to children and adults  8  but it was also one of the first cartoons to outsource its animation  storyboards were shipped to Mexican studio Gamma Productions  the same studio employed by Total Television   As a result  the art has a choppy  unpolished look and the animation is extremely limited  even by television animation standards   However  the series has been held in high esteem by those who have seen it  some critics have described the series as a well written radio program with pictures  9  The show was never a ratings hit and was shuffled around the day  airing in afternoon  prime time  and Saturday morning  but has garnered a minor yet influential cult following over the decades  influencing shows from The Simpsons to Rocko s Modern Life  10  A feature film based on the series was produced by Universal Studios and released on June 30  2000 to lukewarm reviews  11  Contents 1 Background 1 1 Production 1 2 Network television  1959 1973 1 3 Syndicated package 2

Anderson  who previously collaborated on Crusader Rabbit  and was based upon the original property The Frostbite Falls Revue  This original show never got past the proposal stage  It was about a group of forest animals running a television station  The group included Rocket J  Squirrel  Rocky   Oski Bear  Canadian Moose  Bullwinkle   Sylvester Fox  Blackstone Crow  and Floral Fauna  The show in this form was created by Jay Ward s partner Alex Anderson  12  Bullwinkle s name came from the name of a car dealership in Berkeley  California called Bullwinkel Motors  Mr  Anderson changed the spelling of the name and gave it to his moose  and an unforgettable cartoon character was born  13  Ward wanted to produce the show in Los Angeles  however  Anderson lived in the San Francisco Bay Area and did not want to relocate  As a result  Ward hired Bill Scott  who became the head writer and co producer at Jay Ward Productions  and who wrote all of the Rocky and Bullwinkle features  Ward was joined by writers Chris Hayward  14  and Allan Burns  who later became head writer for MTM Enterprises   edit  Production The series began with the pilot Rocky the Flying Squirrel  Production began in February 1958 with the hiring of voice actors June Foray  Paul Frees  Bill Scott  and William Conrad  Eight months later  General Mills signed a deal to sponsor the cartoon  under the condition that the show be run in a late afternoon time slot  where it could be targeted toward children  Subsequently  Ward hired most of the rest of the production staff  including writers and designers  However  no animators were hired  since Ward was able to convince some friends at Dancer  Fitzgerald   amp  Sample   an advertising agency that had General Mills as a client   to buy an animation studio in Mexico called Gamma Productions S A  de C V   originally known as Val Mar Animation  This outsourcing of the animation for the series was considered financially attractive by primary sponsor General Mills  but caused numerous problems  In a 1982 interview by animation historian Jim Korkis  Bill Scott described some of the problems that arose during production of the series  We found out very quickly that we could not depend on Mexican studios to produce anything of quality  They were turning out the work very quickly and there were all kinds of mistakes and flaws and boo boos     They would never check     Mustaches popped on and off Boris  Bullwinkle s antlers would change  colors would change  costumes would disappear     By the time we finally saw it  it was on the air  15   edit  Network television  1959 1973 See also  List of Rocky and Bullwinkle episodes The show was broadcast for the first time on November 19  1959 on the ABC television network under the title Rocky and His Friends twice a week  on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons  following American Bandstand at 5 30 p m  ET  where it was the highest rated daytime network program  16  The show moved to the NBC network starting September 24  1961  broadcast in color and first appeared on Sundays at 7 p m  ET  just before Walt Disney s Wonderful World of Color  Bullwinkle s ratings suffered as a result of being aired opposite perennial favorite Lassie  A potential move to CBS 15  caused NBC to reschedule the show to late Sunday afternoons  5 30 p m  ET  15  and early Saturday afternoons in its final season  NBC canceled the show in the summer of 1964  It was shopped to ABC  but they were not interested  However  reruns of episodes were aired on ABC s Sunday morning schedule at 11 a m  ET until 1973  at which time the series went into syndication  An abbreviated fifteen minute version of the series ran in syndication in the 1960s under the title The Rocky Show  This version was sometimes shown in conjunction with The King and Odie  a fifteen minute version of Total Television s King Leonardo and His Short Subjects  The King and Odie was similar to Rocky and Bullwinkle in that it was sponsored by General Mills and animated by Gamma Productions  NBC later aired Bullwinkle Show reruns at 12 30 p m  ET Saturday afternoons during the 1981 1982 television season  The series ran on cable in the late 1980s early 1990s on Nickelodeon  and later from the 1990s into the early 2000s on Cartoon Network  As of March 2011  the show is rerunning on the Boomerang channel Saturday and Sunday at 6 30 a m  ET   edit  Syndicated package Sponsor General Mills retains all United States television rights to the series  which remains available in domestic syndication through The Program Exchange  although the underlying rights are now owned by Bullwinkle Studios  a joint venture of copyright holder Ward Productions and Classic Media  Two packages  each containing different episodes  are available  The syndicated version of The Bullwinkle Show contains 98 half hour shows   801 898   The first 78 comprise the Rocky  amp  Bullwinkle story lines from the first two seasons of the original series  these segments originally aired under the Rocky And His Friends title   Other elements in the half hour shows  Fractured Fairy Tales  Peabody s Improbable History  Dudley Do Right Of The Mounties  Aesop and Son  and short cartoons including Bullwinkle s Corner and Mr  Know It All  sometimes appear out of the original broadcast sequence  The final 20 syndicated Bullwinkle Show episodes feature later Rocky  amp  Bullwinkle story lines  from  Bumbling Bros  Circus  through the end of the series  minus  Moosylvania   along with Fractured Fairy Tales  Bullwinkle s Corner  and Mr  Know It All segments repeated from earlier in the syndicated episode cycle  Originally  many of the syndicated shows included segments of Total Television s The World of Commander McBragg  but these cartoons were replaced with other segments when the shows were remastered in the early 1990s  Another package  promoted under the Rocky And His Friends name but utilizing The Rocky Show titles  features other story lines not included in the syndicated Bullwinkle Show series  The current syndicated Rocky And His Friends package still retains the 15 minute format  consisting of 156 individual episodes  but like The Bullwinkle Show  its content differs from the versions syndicated in the 1960s  In fact  neither package includes all the supporting cartoon segments  however  all of the Fractured Fairy Tales  91   Peabody s Improbable History  91   and Aesop and Son  39  segments are syndicated as part of Tennessee Tuxedo And His Tales  and 38 of the 39 Dudley Do Right cartoons are syndicated as part of Dudley Do Right  sic  And Friends  Syndicated versions of the shows distributed outside of the United States and Canada are again different  combining all of the various segments under the package title Rocky And Bullwinkle And Friends  it is this version of the show that is represented on official DVD releases by Classic Media   edit  Characters  From left to right  Rocky  Bullwinkle  and Captain Peter Peachfuzz  The lead characters and heroes of the series were Rocket  Rocky  J  Squirrel  a flying squirrel  and his best friend Bullwinkle J  Moose  a dim witted but good natured moose  Both characters lived in the fictional town of Frostbite Falls  Minnesota  which was based on the real life city of International Falls  Minnesota  17  The scheming villains in most episodes were the fiendish  but inept  agents of the fictitious nation of Pottsylvania  Boris Badenov  a pun on Boris Godunov  and Natasha Fatale  a pun on femme fatale  Boris and Natasha were commanded by the sinister Mr  Big and Fearless Leader  Other characters included Gidney  amp  Cloyd  little green men from the moon who were armed with scrooch guns  Captain Peter  Wrongway  Peachfuzz  the captain of the S S  Andalusia  and the inevitable onlookers  Edgar and Chauncy  18   edit  Structure When first shown on NBC  the cartoons were introduced by a Bullwinkle puppet  voiced by Bill Scott  who would often lampoon celebrities  current events  and especially Walt Disney  whose program Wonderful World of Color was the next show on the schedule  On one occasion   Bullwinkle  encouraged children to pull the tuning knobs off the TV set   In that way   explained Bullwinkle   we ll be sure to be with you next week   The network received complaints from parents of an estimated 20 000 child viewers who apparently followed Bullwinkle s suggestion  Bullwinkle told the children the following week to put the knobs back on with glue  and make it stick    The puppet sequence was dropped altogether  19  He did a segment called  Dear Bullwinkle   where letters specially made for the show were read and answered humorously  Four episodes of  Dear Bullwinkle  are on the Season 1 DVD  Each episode is composed of two  Rocky  amp  Bullwinkle  cliffhanger shorts that stylistically emulated early radio and film serials  The plots of these shorts would combine into story arcs spanning numerous episodes  The first and longest story arc was Jet Fuel Formula consisting of 40 shorts  20 episodes   Stories ranged from seeking the missing ingredient for a rocket fuel formula  to tracking the monstrous whale Maybe Dick  to an attempt to prevent mechanical  metal munching  moon mice from devouring the nation s television antennas  Rocky and Bullwinkle frequently encounter the two Pottsylvanian nogoodniks  Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale  At the end of most episodes  the narrator  William Conrad  would announce two humorous titles for the next episode that typically were puns of each other  For example  during an adventure taking place in a mountain range  the narrator would state   Be with us next time for  Avalanche Is Better Than None   or  Snow s Your Old Man    Such a  This   or  That  title announcement had been used in The Adventures of Sam Spade radio shows produced in 1946 50  The narrator frequently had conversations with the characters  thus breaking the fourth wall  Episodes were introduced with one of four opening sequences  Rocky flies about snow covered mountains  Below him  hiking on a snowy trail  Bullwinkle is distracted by a billboard featuring his name  and walks off a ledge  He becomes a large snowball as he rolls downhill  Rocky flies to him and pushes against the snowball  slowing it to a halt just at the edge of another cliff  Bullwinkle pops out of the snowball to catch the teetering squirrel at the cliff edge  In a circus  Rocky is preparing to jump from a very high diving board into a tub of water tended by Bullwinkle  However  when Rocky jumps  he ends up flying around the circus tent  while Bullwinkle chases after him carrying the tub  As Rocky lands safely  Bullwinkle tumbles into the tub  Rocky is flying acrobatically about a city landscape  Bullwinkle is high atop a flagpole painting  and is knocked from his perch as the squirrel flies by  Rocky attempts to catch the plummeting moose with a butterfly net  but the moose falls through it  Rocky then flies lower to find his friend suspended from a clothesline  having fallen into a pair of long johns  Similar to the previous opening  Rocky is again flying about the city  Bullwinkle is suspended from a safety harness on a large billboard  posting a sign  He loses his balance as the squirrel zooms past him and tumbles off the platform  The moose lands on a banner pole mounted on the side of a building  and the recoil springs him back into the air  He lands on a store awning  slides down it  and drops a few feet to a bench on which Rocky is seated  The impact launches the squirrel off the bench  and Bullwinkle nonchalantly catches him in his left hand to end the sequence  Episodes ended with a bumper sequence in which a violent lightning storm destroys the landscape  appearing to engulf Rocky and Bullwinkle in the destruction and accompanied by dramatic piano music  The music would become more lighthearted  and the ground would scroll upward while the outlines of the heroes gradually appeared  We then see a smiling sun overlooking a barren field which rapidly fills with sunflowers until Rocky and Bullwinkle finally sprout from the ground   edit  Supporting features The  Rocky  amp  Bullwinkle  shorts serve as  bookends  for several other popular supporting features  including  Dudley Do Right of the Mounties  a parody of early 20th century melodrama and silent film serials of the Northern genre  Dudley Do Right is a Canadian Mountie in constant pursuit of his nemesis  Snidely Whiplash  who sports the standard  villain  attire of black top hat  cape  and over sized moustache  This is one of the few Jay Ward cartoons to feature a background music track  As is standard in Ward s cartoons  jokes often have more than one meaning  A standard gag is to introduce characters in an irised close up with the name of the  actor  displayed in a caption below  a convention seen in some early silent films  However  the comic twist is using the captions to present silly names or subtle puns  Occasionally  even the scenery is introduced in this manner  as when  Dead Man s Gulch  is identified as being portrayed by  Gorgeous Gorge   a reference to professional wrestler Gorgeous George  Peabody s Improbable History features a talking dog genius named Mister Peabody who has a pet boy named Sherman  Peabody and Sherman use Peabody s  WABAC machine   pronounced  way back   and partially a play on names of early computers such as UNIVAC and ENIAC  to go back in time to discover the real story behind historical events  and in many cases  intervene with uncooperative historical figures to ensure that events actually transpire as history has recorded  They are famous for including a terrible pun at the end  For example  when going back to the time of Pancho Villa  they show Pancho a photo of a woman and he promptly gets the urge to take a nap  When Sherman asks why this is so  Peabody says that the woman s name is Esther  and whenever you  see Esther   siesta  you fall asleep  Fractured Fairy Tales presented familiar fairy tales and children s stories  but with storylines altered and modernized for humorous effect  This segment was narrated by Edward Everett Horton  June Foray  Bill Scott  Paul Frees  and an uncredited Daws Butler often supplied the voices  Aesop  amp  Son is similar to Fractured Fairy Tales  complete with the same theme music  except it deals with fables instead of fairy tales  The typical structure consists of Aesop attempting to teach a lesson to his son using a fable  After hearing the story  the son subverts the fable s moral with a pun  This structure was also suggested by the feature s opening titles  which showed Aesop painstakingly carving his name in marble using a mallet and chisel and then his son  with a jackhammer and raising a cloud of dust  appending   amp  Son   Aesop was voiced  uncredited  by actor Charlie Ruggles and his son  Junior  was voiced by Daws Butler  Bullwinkle s Corner features the dimwitted moose attempting to inject culture into the proceedings by reciting poems and nursery rhymes  inadvertently and humorously butchering them  Poems subjected to this treatment include several by Robert Louis Stevenson   My Shadow    The Swing   and  Where Go the Boats    William Wordsworth s  Daffodils    Little Miss Muffet    Little Jack Horner   and  Wee Willie Winkie   J  G  Whittier s  Barbara Frietchie   and  The Queen of Hearts  by Charles Lamb  Simple Simon is performed with Boris as the pie man  but as a variation of the famous Abbott and Costello routine  Who s on First    Mr  Know It All again features Bullwinkle posing as an authority on any topic  Disaster inevitably ensues  Rocky and Bullwinkle Fan Club  a series of abortive attempts by Rocky and Bullwinkle to conduct the club s business  The fan club consists only of Rocky  Bullwinkle  Boris  Natasha  and Captain Peter Peachfuzz  These shorts show these characters out of character  The World of Commander McBragg  short features on revisionist history as the title character would have imagined it  this was actually prepared for Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales  and later shown on The Underdog Show   Although the shorts were animated by the same animation company  Gamma Productions  they were actually produced for Total Television  rather than Ward Productions  These segments were part of pre 1990 syndicated versions of The Bullwinkle Show and appear in syndicated episodes of The Underdog Show  Dudley Do Right And Friends  and Uncle Waldo s Cartoon Show  Sherman and Mr  Peabody enter the WABAC machine The WABAC or Wayback Machine is a time machine used by Mr  Peabody and Sherman to witness  participate in  and more often than not alter famous events in history  20  The term  Wayback Machine  is a colloquial term used to this day in Internet applications such as Wikipedia and the Internet Archive to refer to the ability to see or revert to older

Scott campaigned for statehood for  Moosylvania   Bullwinkle s fictional home state  They drove a van to about 50 cities collecting petition signatures  Arriving in Washington D C   they pulled up to the White House gate to see President Kennedy  and were brusquely turned away  They learned that the evening they had arrived was during the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis  21  British Invasion band Herman s Hermits got its name because bandmates thought lead singer Peter Noone looked like Sherman of  Mr  Peabody  fame  and the name  Herman  was close enough to  Sherman  for them  TSR  Inc  produced a role playing game based on the world of Bullwinkle and Rocky in 1988  The game consisted of rules  mylar hand puppets  cards  and spinners  22  A pinball machine dedicated to Rocky and Bullwinkle was released in 1993 by Data East  23  When this show aired on Nickelodeon  it was entitled  Bullwinkle s Moose a rama  with the same end credits as  The Bullwinkle Show   Cartoon Network aired the show under the new  The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show  title  featuring their own version of the characters among a purple and green checkerboard background while retaining the original end credits  In January 2009  IGN named Rocky and Bullwinkle as the 11th best animated television series  24  In 2002  Rocky and His Friends ranked  47 on TV Guide s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time  25   edit  Revival attempts There were attempts to revive Rocky  amp  Bullwinkle throughout the 1970s  A revival in 1981 parodied the Super Bowl  A script was written  storyboards were produced  the network gave it a green light  but the project was canceled because of objections from the NFL   Actual team owners were parodied  and Boris was fixing the game   15   edit  CED Videodisc Releases The program debuted on home video with two compilation CED Videodiscs released by RCA during the format s rise in the early 1980s  featuring complete  uncut story arcs and accompanying alternating segments and bumpers  Volume 1 contained the complete story for  Wossamotta U   while volume 2 contained  Goof Gas Attack  and  The Three Mooseketeers    edit  VHS and LaserDisc Releases Buena Vista Home Video released the show on VHS and LaserDisc in the early 1990s  under the title The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle  These are presented differently than when broadcast  Two  Rocky and Bullwinkle  chapters were sometimes edited together into one  removing the  titles  for the next chapters as well as part of the recap at the beginning of the next   usually showing the storyline in four or five chapters per video  For example  the 12 episode Wossamotta U  adventure is reduced to seven episodes  and runs about seven minutes shorter  The  Bullwinkle Show  closing was used on these  The first eight videos were released under the  Classic Stuff  banner  with covers and titles being parodies of famous paintings or painters  Four more videos were released under the  Funny Stuff  banner  but unlike the first eight  these were not numbered  the video titles matched the title of the featured  Rocky and Bullwinkle  storyline  and the covers represented something that appeared on the show  such as Bullwinkle pulling a rhino out of a hat as the cover for  Painting Theft     The change in the banner might have been due to one of the video magazines publishing a letter criticizing the editing   The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle Season 1 is available in Cracker Barrel for VHS  Volume   VHS Name Ep Additional Segments 1   Mona Moose   The Treasure of Monte Zoom

Productions established a partnership with Classic Media called Bullwinkle Studios  From 2003 to 2005  the partnership produced DVDs of the first three seasons of the series  which were renamed  for legal reasons  Rocky  amp  Bullwinkle  amp  Friends  Releases then stalled until 2010  when season 4 was released  in part to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the series  26  The complete series was then released on January 4  2011  27  marking the debut of season 5 on DVD  A standalone release of season 5 was released on March 29  2011  28  The DVDs for the first 3 seasons were distributed by Sony Wonder  while season 4  5 and Complete Series sets are currently distributed by Vivendi Entertainment  The DVD releases of the shows differ somewhat from the originals  The renaming of the show led to the sometimes clumsy superimposition of the new title onto preexisting opening credits and interior bumpers  29  A Bill Conrad sound alike was used on to announce the new title  which some viewers found jarring  29  In addition  a semi transparent  R amp B  logo appears for five seconds at the beginning of each segment in the lower right hand corner  Some segments were also moved from their placement in the original episodes  Also  the season 5 shows on DVD recycle supporting features found on the DVDs for the first four seasons  Mathematically  this makes sense since the total number of supporting features  assuming two used per show  exactly equals the number of shows created during the first four seasons  The first set  most of the second set  and the fifth season set use the second opening and closing used for the  Rocky and His Friends  broadcast  while the last two story arcs in the second set  as well as the third and fourth season sets  use the original opening and closing from the  Rocky and His Friends  broadcast  The musical themes are also replaced on all five sets with ones produced for the second season  In addition  the first four season sets also feature optional Spanish language audio tracks  In 2005  Bullwinkle Studios released a series of  best of  DVD compilations of popular segments of the series  two volumes of  The Best of Rocky and Bullwinkle   plus the single volume  The Best of Boris and Natasha    The Best of Mr  Peabody and Sherman    The Best of Fractured Fairy Tales   and  The Best of Dudley Do Right   These compilations

theatrical film starring Rocky and Bullwinkle  was released in 2000  It was mostly live action with Rocky and Bullwinkle appearing as computer generated characters  For the film  June Foray returned to voice Rocky  while Bullwinkle was voiced by Keith Scott  Jason Alexander and Renee Russo played the live action versions of Boris and Natasha  Although the movie retained the spirit and feel of the original cartoons  most critics did not think the film was as humorous as the original  34  Dudley Do Right  a theatrical live action film  was released in 1999 and starred Brendan Fraser  Sarah Jessica Parker and Alfred Molina  A live action Peabody s Improbable History  Robin Hood was planned for release in 2001  but the film was canceled due to Universal Pictures  Dudley Do Right and The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle underperforming at the box office  More recently when    the film s production was revived by DreamWorks Animation to now be a computer animated film   edit  Comics A syndicated daily newspaper comic strip titled Bullwinkle began in 1962 with original stories drawn by Al Kilgore  Rocky and Bullwinkle comic books were released by Gold Key Comics and  in the 1980s  by Star Comics  an imprint of Marvel Comics   Both were called Bullwinkle and Rocky  The comics  although for children  did contain numerous references spoofing issues such as celebrity worship or the politics of the 1980s  In one issue  Bullwinkle owns a small company  which makes him eligible to compete in a fun run in Washington DC for presidents of small companies  When Bullwinkle says he is there for the race  it is mistaken that he is campaigning for President  The comic also spoofed US President Ronald Reagan  and he personally thanks Bullwinkle for stopping Boris  amp  Natasha by rewarding him with monogrammed jelly beans  Another comic broke the fourth wall when the narrator is outraged at a plot of Boris   to which Boris claims he has control of everyone  by capturing the Marvel Comics building and tying up the editor   When the narrator says how this is morally wrong  Boris quiets him by saying   You will agree or you will not find paycheck in mail this month   The same issue made reference to the 1988 Olympics  which Boris had engineering in Fort Knox  Kentucky in an attempt to steal its gold by carving all the bars into gold medals  as well as furnishing false information to every country so Pottsylvania would win all the gold medals  and thus take all true gold  by virtue of default  After Boris is folied  the narrator comments the games will go on as planned in real time in Seoul  South Korea   edit  Recordings A phonograph album of songs  Rocky the Flying Squirrel  amp  His Friends  was released in 1961 by Golden Records  using voice actors from the series  Boris and Natasha  for example sing   We will double  single and triple cross  our very closest friends   There was also a 78rpm single  Golden 659  released on yellow vinyl  This had Rocky singing  I Was Born To Be Airborne  on one side  backed with Bullwinkle singing  I m Rocky s Pal   The single was sold in grocery stores  Paul Parnes  who later wrote songs for Sesame Street  is credited as composer   Some nutty characters get together here for the benefit of the very young  Lots of laughs for the juvenile sense of humor   35   edit  Video games THQ released The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends for the Nintendo Entertainment System  Game Boy  and Super NES in 1992  Absolute Entertainment also released a version for the Sega Genesis  in 1994  Zen Studios
