Household income is a measure commonly used by the United States government and private institutions  that counts the income of all residents over the age of 18 in each household  including not only all wages and salaries  but such items as unemployment insurance  disability payments  child support payments  not removing child support from wages and salaried yet counting it as overall income actually results in this money counting toward two households  artificially inflating the income between the two households   regular rental receipts  as well as any personal business  investment  or other kinds of income received routinely  1  The residents of the household do not have to be related to the head of the household for their earnings to be considered part of the household s income  2  As households tend to share a similar economic context  the use of household income remains among the most widely accepted measures of income  That the size of a household is not commonly taken into account in such measures may distort any analysis of fluctuations within or among the household income categories  and may render direct comparisons between quintiles difficult or even impossible  3  In 2006  the  real   adjusted for inflation  median annual household income rose 1 3  to  50 233 00 according to the Census Bureau  4  The real median earnings of men who worked full time  year round climbed between 2006 and 2007  from  43 460 to  45 113  about 3 6 time minimum wage in 2006 to 3 7 time minimum wage in 2007   For women  the corresponding increase was from  33 437 to  35 102  2 8 and 2 9 times minimum wage respectively   The median income per household member  including all working and non working members above the age of 14  was  26 036 in 2006  5  In 2006  there were approximately 116 011 000 households in the United States  1 93  of all households had annual incomes exceeding  250 000  6  12 3  fell below the federal poverty threshold 7  and the bottom 20  earned less than  19 178  8  The aggregate income distribution is highly concentrated towards the top  with the top 6 37  earning roughly one third of all income  and those with upper middle incomes controlling a large  though declining  share of the total earned income  3  9 Income inequality in the United States  which had decreased slowly after World War II until 1970  began to increase in the 1970s until reaching a peak in 2006  It declined a little in 2007  10  Households in the top quintile  i e   top 20    77  of which had two or more income earners  had incomes exceeding  91 705  Households in the mid quintile  with a mean of approximately one income earner per household had incomes between  36 000 and  57 657  Households in the lowest quintile had incomes less than  19 178 and the majority had no income earner  11  The 2006 economic survey also found that households in the top two income quintiles  those with an annual household income exceeding  60 000  had a median of two income earners while those in the lower quintiles  2nd and middle quintile  had median of only one income earner per household  Overall  the United States followed the trend of other developed nations with a relatively large population of relatively affluent households outnumbering the poor  Among those in between the extremes of the income strata are a large number of households with moderately high middle class incomes 9  and an even larger number of households with moderately low incomes  6  While the median household income has increased 30  since 1990  it has increased only slightly when considering inflation  In 1990  the median household income was  30 056 or  44 603 in 2003 dollars  While personal income has remained relatively stagnant over the past few decades  household income has risen due to the rising percentage of households with two or more income earners  Between 1999 and 2004 household income stagnated showing a slight increase since 2004  12  13  According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis  per capita income has increased every year for the past 10 years  with an annual average of 5 2  gains for the past 4 years  The recently released US Income Mobility Study showed economic growth resulted in rising incomes for most taxpayers over the period from 1996 to 2005  Median incomes of all taxpayers increased by 24 percent after adjusting for inflation  The real incomes of two thirds of all taxpayers increased over this period  Income mobility of individuals was considerable in the U S  economy during the 1996 through 2005 period with roughly half of taxpayers who began in the bottom quintile moving up to a higher income group within 10 years  In addition  the median incomes of those initially in the lower income groups increased more than the median incomes of those initially in the higher income groups  14  Contents 1 Household income 1 1 Quintiles 1 2 Race 1 3 Ethnic group 1 4 Education and gender 1 5 Age of householder 1 6

of all households  Household type is strongly correlated with household income  Married couples are disproportionately represented in the upper two quintiles  compared to the general population of households  Cross referencing shows that this is likely due to the presence of multiple income earners in these families  Non family households  individuals  are disproportionately represented in the lower two quintiles  Households headed by single males are disproportionately found in the middle three quintiles  single females head households concentrated in the bottom three quintiles  The highest income households are almost ten times as likely to own their homes rather than rent  but in the lowest quintile  the ratio of owners to renters is nearly one to one  The New York Times has used the quintiles to define class  It has assigned the quintiles from lowest to highest as bottom fifth  lower middle  middle  upper middle  and top fifth  15  Data All households Lowest fifth Second

identified as being African American or Black  18  Overall  households headed by Hispanics and African Americans were underrepresented in the top two quintiles and overrepresented in the bottom two quintiles  Households headed by persons who identified as being Asian alone  on the other hand  were overrepresented among the top two quintiles  In the top five percent the percentage of Asians was

graduates with a Master s in Business Administration  MBA  who accepted job offers were expected to earn a base salary of  88 626  They were also expected to receive an  average signing bonus of  17

Overall     a verage earnings ranged from  18 900 for high school dropouts to  25 900 for high school graduates   45 400 for college graduates and  99 300 for workers with professional degrees  M D

with graduate degrees have an average per capita income exceeding the median household income of married couple families among the general population   63 813   22  23  Higher educational attainment did not  however  help close the income gap between the genders as the life time earnings for a male with a professional degree were roughly forty percent  39 59   higher than those of a female with a professional degree  The lifetime earnings gap between males and females was the smallest for those individuals holding an Associate degrees with male life time earnings being 27 77  higher than those of females  While educational attainment did not help reduce the income inequality between men and women  it did increase the earnings potential of individuals of both sexes  enabling many households with one or more graduate degree householders to enter the top household income quintile  22  Household income also increased significantly with the educational attainment of the householder  The US Census Bureau publishes educational attainment and income data for all households with a householder who was aged twenty five or older  The biggest income difference was between those with some college education and those who had a Bachelor s degree  with the latter making  23 874 more annually  Income also increased substantially with increased post secondary education  While the median household income for a household with a householder having an Associates degree was  51 970  the median household income for householders with a Bachelor s degree or higher was  73 446  Those with doctorates had the second highest median household with a median of  96 830   18 289 more than that for those at the Master s degree level  but  3 170 lower than the median for households with a

substantially with the age of the person who heads the household  Overall  the median household income increased with the age of householder until retirement age when household income started to decline  25  The highest median household income was found among households headed by working baby boomers  25  Households headed by persons between the ages of 45 and 54 had a median household income of  61 111 and a mean household income of  77 634  The median income per member of household for this particular group was  27 924  The highest median income per member of household was among those between the ages of 54 and 64 with  30 544  The reason this figure is lower than the next group is because Pensions and Social Security add to income while a portion of older individuals also have work related income     The group with the second highest median household income  were households headed by persons between the ages 35 and 44 with a median income of  56 785  followed by those in the age group between 55 and 64 with  50 400  Not surprisingly the lowest income group was composed of those households headed by individuals younger than 24  followed by those headed by persons over the age of 75  Overall  households headed by persons above the age of seventy five had a median household income of  20 467 with the median household income per member of household being  18 645  These figures support the general assumption that median household income as well as the median income per member of household peaked among those households headed by middle aged persons  increasing with the age of the householder and the size of the household until the householder reaches the age of 64  With retirement income replacing salaries and the size of the household declining  the median household income decreases as well  25   edit  Aggregate income distribution The aggregate income measures the combined income earned by all persons in a particular income group  In 2007  all

time All figures are in 2003 dollars  This graph shows the income of the given percentiles from 1967 to 2003  in 2003 dollars  27  This graph shows the income of the given percentiles from 1967 to 2010  in 2010 dollars  28  Since 1967  the median household income in the United States has risen by 31   fluctuating several times  The rise in household income is largely the result of an increase in personal income among college graduates  a group that has doubled in size since the 1960s  and women entering the labor force  Today  42  of all households have two income earners  Household income increased dramatically faster for affluent households with income inequality having increased steadily since the 1970s  29  30  While household income has increased  its growth has been slowed by a decrease in married couple households who tend to have two earners and  therefore  higher incomes  While the proportion of wives working year round in married couple households with children has increased from 17  in 1967 to 39  in 1996  the proportion of such households among the general population has decreased  This means that the share the most economically prosperous type of household has been dwindling in the United States  31  In 1969  more than 40  of all households consisted of a married couple with children  By 1996 only a rough quarter of US households consisted of married couples with children  As a result of these changing household demographics  median household income rose relatively slowly despite an ever increasing female labor force and a considerable increase in the percentage of college graduates  31     From 1969 to 1996  median household income rose a very modest 6 3 percent in constant dollars    The 1969 to 1996 stagnation in median household income may  in fact  be largely a reflection of changes in the size and composition of households rather than a reflection of a stagnating economy    John McNeil  US Census Bureau   Overall  the median household income rose from  33 338 in 1967 to an all time high of  44 922 in 1999  and has since decreased slightly to  43 318  Decreases in household income are visible during each recession  while increases are visible during economic upturns  These fluctuations were felt across the income strata as the incomes of both the 95th and 20th percentile were affected by fluctuations in the economy  Income in the period between 1967 and 1999 grew considerably faster among wealthier households than it did among poorer households  For example the household income for the 80th precentile  the lower threshold for the top quintile  rose from  55 265 in 1967 to  86 867 in 2003  a 57 2  increase  The median household income rose by 30  while the income for the 20th percentile  the lower threshold for the second lowest quintile  rose by only 28  from  14 002 to  17 984  As the majority of households in the top quintile had two income earners  versus zero for the lowest quintile and that the widening gap between the top and lowest quintile may largely be the reflection of changing household demographics including the addition of women to the workforce  27  31  Household demographics are not  however  the cause of the growing gap between the top 5  and the rest of the upper quintile  The top 5  had fewer dual earner households and full time workers than the top quintile overall  In 2003 a household in the 95th percentile earned 77 2  more than a household in the 80th percentile  compared to 60 5  in 1967  a 27 6  increase in the earnings increase discrepancy between the two groups  Overall the income of the 95th percentile grew 15 2  faster than that of the 80th  146 8  faster than that of the median and 159 9  faster than that of the 20th percentile  32  Households in the top 1  experienced the by far greatest increases in household income  According to economist Janet Yellen  the growth  in real income  was heavily concentrated at the very tip of the top  that is  the top 1 percent   33  A 2006 analysis of IRS income data by economists Emmanuel Saez at the University of California  Berkeley and Thomas Piketty at the Paris School of Economics showed that the share of income held by the top 1  was as large in 2005 as in 1928  The data revealed that reported income increased by 9  in 2005  with the mean for the top 1  increasing by 14  and that for the bottom 90  dropping slightly by 0 6   34  While per capita disposable income has increased 469  since 1972  it has only increased moderately when inflation is considered  In 1972  disposable personal income was determined to be  4 129   19 385 in 2005 dollars  In 2005  disposable personal income was  however   27 640  a 43  increase  35  36  Since the late 1990s  household income has fallen slightly  37  The

indicators of social class  Household income and education do not  however  always reflect perceived class status correctly  Sociologist Dennis Gilbert acknowledges that      the class structure    does not exactly match the distribution of household income  with  the mismatch  being  greatest in the middle      Gilbert  1998  92  As social classes commonly overlap  it is not possible to define exact class boundaries  According to Leonard Beeghley citation needed  a household income of roughly  95 000 would be typical of a dual earner middle class household while  60 000 would be typical of a dual earner working class household and  18 000 typical for an impoverished household  William Thompson and Joseph Hickey citation needed  see common incomes for the upper class as those exceeding  500 000 with upper middle class incomes ranging from the high 5 figures to most commonly in excess of  100 000  They claim the lower middle class ranges from  35 000 to  75 000   16 000 to  30 000 for

evenly in the middle with half of all household earning more than the median income and half of all households earning less than the median household income  According to the US Census Bureau  the median is  considerably lower than the average  and provides a more accurate representation   45  Considering other racial and geographical differences in regards to household income  it should come as no surprise that the median household income varies with race  size of household and geography  The state with the highest median household income in the United States as of the US Census Bureau 2005 06 is New Jersey with  66 752  followed by Maryland  Hawaii and Connecticut  making the Northeastern United States the wealthiest area by income in the entire country  46  Regionally  in 2010  the Northeast reached a median income of  53 283  the West   53 142  the South   45 492  and the Midwest   48 445  47  Each figure represents a decline from the previous year  While median household income has a tendency to increase up to four persons per household  it declines thereon after  This indicated that while four person households have larger incomes than those with one  two or three members  households seem to earn progressively less as their size increases beyond four persons  According to the US Census Bureau 2004 Community Survey  two person households had a median income of  39 755  with  48 957 for three person households   54 338 for four person households   50 905 for five person households   45 435 for six person households  with seven or more person households having the second lowest median income of only  42 471  48  In terms of race  Asian American households had the highest median household income of  57 518  European American households ranked second with  48 977  Hispanic or Latino households ranked third with  34 241  African American or Black households had the lowest median household income of all races with  30 134  49   edit  Mean income Another common measurement of personal income is the mean household income  Unlike the median household income  which divides all households in two halves  the mean income is the average income earned by American households  In the case of mean income  the income of all households is divided by the number of all households  50  The mean income is usually more affected by the relatively unequal distribution of income which tilts towards the top  45  As a result  the mean tends to be higher than the median income  with the top earning households boosting it  Overall  the mean household income in the United States  according to the US Census Bureau 2004 Economic Survey  was  60 528  or  17 210  39 73   higher than the median household income  51     Median income is the amount which divides the income distribution into two equal groups  half having income above that amount  and half having income below that amount  Mean income  average  is the amount obtained by dividing the total aggregate income of a group by the number of units in that group  The means and medians for households and families are based on all households and families  Means and medians for people are based on people 15 years old and over with income   50   US Census Bureau  Frequently Asked Question  published by First Gov    The US Census Bureau also provides a breakdown by self identified ethnic groups
