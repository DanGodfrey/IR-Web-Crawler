Conflict of laws Commercial law Other common law areas Tort law Property law Wills  trusts and estates Criminal law Evidence v t e A contract is an agreement entered into voluntarily by two parties or more with the intention of creating a legal obligation  which may have elements in writing  though contracts can be made orally  The remedy for breach of contract can be  damages  or compensation of money  In equity  the remedy can be specific performance of the contract or an injunction  Both of these remedies award the party at loss the  benefit of the bargain  or expectation damages  which are greater than mere reliance damages  as in promissory estoppel  The parties may be natural persons or juristic persons  A contract is a legally enforceable promise or undertaking that something will or will not occur  The word promise can be used as a legal synonym for contract  1   although care is required as a promise may not have the full standing of a contract  as when it is an agreement without consideration  Contract law varies greatly from one jurisdiction to another  including differences in common law compared to civil law  the impact of received law  particularly from England in common law countries  and of law codified in regional legislation  Regarding Australian Contract Law for example  there are 40 relevant acts which impact on the interpretation of contract at the Commonwealth  Federal   national  level  and an additional 26 acts at the level of the state of NSW  In addition there are 6 international instruments or conventions which are applicable for international dealings  such as the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods  Vienna Sales Convention  2  Contents 1 Origin and scope 2 Elements 2 1 Mutual assent 2 1

scope Contract law is based on the principle expressed in the Latin phrase pacta sunt servanda  which is usually translated  agreements must be kept  but more literally means  pacts must be kept   3  Contract law can be classified  as is habitual in civil law systems  as part of a general law of obligations  along with tort  unjust enrichment  and restitution  As a means of economic ordering  contract relies on the notion of consensual exchange and has been extensively discussed in broader economic  sociological  and anthropological terms  see  Contractual theory  below   In American English  the term extends beyond the legal meaning to encompass a broader category of agreements  4  This article mainly concerns the common law  Such jurisdictions usually retain a high degree of freedom of contract  with parties largely at liberty to set their own terms  This is in contrast to the civil law  which typically applies certain overarching principles to disputes arising out of contract  as in the French Civil Code  However  contract is a form of economic ordering common throughout the world  and different rules apply in jurisdictions applying civil law  derived from Roman law principles   Islamic law  socialist legal systems  and customary or local law   edit  Elements At common law  the elements of a contract are offer  acceptance  intention to create legal relations  and consideration   edit  Mutual assent At common law  mutual assent is typically reached through offer and acceptance  that is  when an offer is met with an acceptance that is unqualified and that does not vary the offer s terms  The latter requirement is known as the  mirror image  rule  If a purported acceptance does vary the terms of an offer  it is not an acceptance but a counteroffer and  therefore  simultaneously a rejection of the original offer  The Uniform Commercial Code notably disposes of the mirror image rule in   2 207  although the UCC only governs transactions in goods in the USA   edit  Offer and acceptance Main article  Offer and acceptance The most important feature of a contract is that one party makes an offer for an arrangement that another accepts  This can be called a concurrence of wills or consensus ad idem  meeting of the minds  of two or more parties  The concept is somewhat contested  The obvious objection is that a court cannot read minds and the existence or otherwise of agreement is judged objectively  with only limited room for questioning subjective intention  see Smith v  Hughes  5  Richard Austen Baker has suggested that the perpetuation of the idea of  meeting of minds  may come from a misunderstanding of the Latin term  consensus ad idem   which actually means  agreement to the  same  thing   6  There must be evidence that the parties had each  from an objective perspective  engaged in conduct manifesting their assent  and a contract will be formed when the parties have met such a requirement  7  An objective perspective means that it is only necessary that somebody gives the impression of offering or accepting contractual terms in the eyes of a reasonable person  not that they actually did want to form a contract  The case of Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company 8  is an example of a  unilateral contract   The term unilateral contract is used in contract law although ultimately there is an offerer and an offeree and a consideration  which may be an act   and in Australian Mills v The Commonwealth 9   the High Court of Australia considered the term  unscientific and misleading   10  Obligations are only imposed upon one party upon acceptance by performance of a condition  In the United States  the general rule is that in  case of doubt  an offer is interpreted as inviting the offeree to accept either by promising to perform what the offer requests or by rendering the performance  as the offeree chooses   11  Offer and acceptance does not always need to be expressed orally or in writing  An implied contract is one in which some of the terms are not expressed in words  This can take two forms  A contract which is implied in fact is one in which the circumstances imply that parties have reached an agreement even though they have not done so expressly  For example  by going to a doctor for a checkup  a patient agrees that he will pay a fair price for the service  If one refuses to pay after being examined  the patient has breached a contract implied in fact  A contract which is implied in law is also called a quasi contract  because it is not in fact a contract  rather  it is a means for the courts to remedy situations in which one party would be unjustly enriched were he or she not required to compensate the other  For example  a plumber accidentally installs a sprinkler system in the lawn of the wrong house  The owner of the house had learned the previous day that his neighbor was getting new sprinklers  That morning  he sees the plumber installing them in his lawn  Pleased at the mistake  he says nothing  and then refuses to pay when the plumber delivers the bill  Will the man be held liable for payment  Yes  if it could be proven that the man knew that the sprinklers were being installed mistakenly  the court would make him pay because of a quasi contract  If that knowledge could not be proven  he would not be liable  Such a claim is also referred to as  quantum meruit   12   edit  Consideration Main article  Consideration Consideration is something of value given by a promissor to a promisee in exchange for something of value given by a promisee to a promissor  Typically  the thing of value is a payment  although it may be an act  or forbearance to act  when one is privileged to do so  such as an adult refraining from smoking  Consideration consists of a legal detriment and a bargain  A legal detriment is a promise to do something or refrain from doing something that you have the legal right to do  or voluntarily doing or refraining from doing something  in the context of an agreement  A bargain is something the promisor  the party making promise or offer  wants  usually being one of the legal detriments  The legal detriment and bargain principles come together in consideration and create an exchange relationship  where both parties agree to exchange something that the other wishes to have  The purpose of consideration is to ensure that there is a present bargain  that the promises of the parties are reciprocally induced  The classic theory of consideration required that a promise be of detriment to the promissor or benefit to the promisee  This is no longer the case in the USA  typically  courts will look to a bargained for exchange  rather than making inquiries into whether an individual was subject to a detriment or not  The emphasis is on the bargaining process  not an inquiry into the relative value of consideration  This principle was articulated in Hamer v  Sidway  Yet in cases of ambiguity  courts will occasionally turn to the common law benefit detriment analysis to aid in the determination of the enforceability of a contract   edit  Sufficiency Consideration must be sufficient  but courts will not weight the adequacy of consideration  For instance  agreeing to sell a car for a penny may constitute a binding contract  13  All that must be shown is that the seller actually wanted the penny  This is known as the peppercorn rule  Otherwise  the penny would constitute nominal consideration  which is insufficient  Parties may do this for tax purposes  attempting to disguise gift transactions as contracts  Transfer of money is typically recognized as an example of sufficient consideration  but in some cases it will not suffice  for example  when one party agrees to make partial payment of a debt in exchange for being released from the full amount  14  Past consideration is not sufficient  Indeed  it is an oxymoron  For instance  in Eastwood v  Kenyon  15  the guardian of a young girl obtained a loan to educate the girl and to improve her marriage prospects  After her marriage  her husband promised to pay off the loan  It was held that the guardian could not enforce the promise because taking out the loan to raise and educate the girl was past consideration it was completed before the husband promised to repay it  The insufficiency of past consideration is related to the preexisting duty rule  The classic instance is Stilk v  Myrick  16  in which a captain s promise to divide the wages of two deserters among the remaining crew if they would sail home from the Baltic short handed  was found unenforceable on the grounds that the crew were already contracted to sail the ship through all perils of the sea  The preexisting duty rule also extends beyond an underlying contract  It would not constitute sufficient consideration for a party to promise to refrain from committing a tort or crime  for example  17  However  a promise from A to do something for B if B will perform a contractual obligation B owes to C  will be enforceable   B is suffering a legal detriment by making his performance of his contract with A effectively enforceable by C as well as by A  18  Consideration must move from the promisee  For instance  it is good consideration for person A to pay person C in return for services rendered by person B  If there are joint promisees  then consideration need only to move from one of the promisees   edit  Other jurisdictions Roman law based systems 19   including Scotland  do not require consideration  and some commentators consider it unnecessary the requirement of intent by both parties to create legal relations by both parties performs the same function under contract  The reason that both exist in common law jurisdictions is thought by leading scholars to be the result of the combining by 19th century judges of two distinct threads  first the consideration requirement was at the heart of the action of assumpsit  which had grown up in the Middle Ages and remained the normal action for breach of a simple contract in England  amp  Wales until 1884  when the old forms of action were abolished  secondly  the notion of agreement between two or more parties as being the essential legal and moral foundation of contract in all legal systems  promoted by the 18th century French writer Pothier in his Traite des Obligations  much read  especially after translation into English in 1805  by English judges and jurists  The latter chimed well with the fashionable will theories of the time  especially John Stuart Mill s influential ideas on free will  and got grafted on to the traditional common law requirement for consideration to ground an action in assumpsit  20  Civil law systems take the approach that an exchange of promises  or a concurrence of wills alone  rather than an exchange in valuable rights is the correct basis  So if you promised to give me a book  and I accepted your offer without giving anything in return  I would have a legal right to the book and you could not change your mind about giving me it as a gift  However  in common law systems the concept of culpa in contrahendo  a form of  estoppel   is increasingly used to create obligations during pre contractual negotiations  21  Estoppel is an equitable doctrine that provides for the creation of legal obligations if a party has given another an assurance and the other has relied on the assurance to his detriment  A number of commentators have suggested that consideration be abandoned  and estoppel be used to replace it as a basis for contracts  22  However  legislation  rather than judicial development  has been touted as the only way to remove this entrenched common law doctrine  Lord Justice Denning famously stated that  The doctrine of consideration is too firmly fixed to be overthrown by a side wind   23  See also  Consideration under English law and Consideration under American law  edit  Formation In addition to the elements of a contract  a party must have capacity to contract  the purpose of the contract must be lawful  the form of the contract must be legal  the parties must intend to create a legal relationship  and the parties must consent  As a result  there are a variety of affirmative defenses that a party may assert to avoid his obligation   edit  Affirmative defenses Vitiating factors constituting defences to purported contract formation include  mistake  incapacity  including mental incompetence and infancy minority  duress  undue influence  unconscionability  misrepresentation fraud  and frustration of purpose  Such defenses operate to determine whether a purported contract is either  1  void or  2  voidable  Void contracts cannot be ratified by either party  Voidable contracts can be ratified   edit  Freedom to contract and Hurley v  Eddingfield In most systems of law  parties have freedom to choose whether or not they wish to enter into a contract  absent superseding duties  In American law  one early case exemplifying this proposition is Hurley v  Eddingfield  1901   in which the Supreme Court of Indiana ruled in favor of a physician who voluntarily decided not to help a patient whom the physician had treated on past occasions  despite the lack of other available medical assistance and the patient s subsequent death  24  In addition  for some contracts formalities must be complied with under legislation sometimes called a statute of frauds  especially transactions in real property or for relatively large cash amounts    edit  Invitation to treat Main article  Invitation to treat Where a product in large quantities is advertised in a newspaper or on a poster  it generally is not considered an offer but instead will be regarded as an invitation to treat  since there is no guarantee that the store can provide the item for everyone who might want one  This was the basis of the decision in Partridge v  Crittenden 25  a criminal case in which the defendant was charged with  offering for sale  bramblefinch cocks and hens  The court held that the newspaper advertisement could only be an invitation to treat  since it could not have been intended as an offer to the world  so the defendant was not guilty of  offering  them for sale  Similarly  a display of goods in a shop window is an invitation to treat  as was held in Fisher v  Bell 26  another criminal case which turned on the correct analysis of offers as against invitations to treat  In this instance the defendant was charged with  offering for sale  prohibited kinds of knife  which he had displayed in his shop window with prices attached  The court held that this was an invitation to treat  the offer would be made by a purchaser going into the shop and asking to buy a knife  with acceptance being by the shopkeeper  which he could withhold   The law was later amended to  exposing for sale    A display of goods on the shelves of a self service shop is also an invitation to treat  with the offer being made by the purchaser at the checkout and being accepted by the shop assistant operating the checkout  Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v  Boots Cash Chemists  Southern  Ltd  27  If the person who is to buy the advertised product is of importance  for instance because of his personality  etc   when buying land  it is regarded merely as an invitation to treat  In Carbolic Smoke Ball  the major difference was that a reward was included in the advertisement  which is a general exception to the rule and is then treated as an offer  The Carbolic Smoke Ball offer One of the most famous cases on invitation to treat is Carlill v  Carbolic Smoke Ball Company  28  decided in nineteenth century England  A medical firm advertised that its new wonder drug  a smoke ball  would  according to the instructions  prevent those who used it from catching the flu  If it did not work  buyers would receive  100 and the company said that they had deposited  1 000 in the bank to show their good faith  When sued  Carbolic argued the ad was not to be taken as a serious  legally binding offer  It was merely an invitation to treat  and a gimmick  a  mere puff    But the court of appeal held that it would appear to a reasonable man that Carbolic had made a serious offer  primarily because of the reference to the  1000 deposited into the bank  People had given good  consideration  for it by going to the  distinct inconvenience  of using a faulty product   Read the advertisement how you will  and twist it about as you will   said Lindley LJ   here is a distinct promise expressed in language which is perfectly unmistakable   Most states consider persons under the age of 18 to be minors  They have the right to cancel the contract at any time before and even after reaching the age of 18  If  however  a minor cancels the contract  the benefits that he or she received must be returned  Contracts entered into by a minor as one party and an adult as the other party are enforceable if the adult breaches the contract  The minor can enforce the contract and collect damages by the adult s breach  However  if the minor breaches the contract  the adult does not have the legal authority to enforce the contract and cannot collect damages under the bargain principle  Promissory estoppel or unjust enrichment may be available  but generally are not   edit  Intention to be legally bound Main article  Intention to be legally bound There is a presumption for commercial agreements that parties intend to be legally bound  unless the parties expressly state that they do not want to be bound  like in heads of agreement   On the other hand  many kinds of domestic and social agreements are unenforceable on the basis of public policy  for instance between children and parents  One early example is found in Balfour v  Balfour  29  Using contract like terms  Mr  Balfour had agreed to give his wife  30 a month as maintenance while he was living in Ceylon  Sri Lanka   Once he left  they separated and Mr  Balfour stopped payments  Mrs  Balfour brought an action to enforce the payments  At the Court of Appeal  the Court held that there was no enforceable agreement as there was not enough evidence to suggest that they were intending to be legally bound by the promise  The case is often cited in conjunction with Merritt v Merritt  30  Here the court distinguished the case from Balfour v  Balfour because Mr  and Mrs  Merritt  although married again  were estranged at the time the agreement was made  Therefore any agreement between them was made with the intention to create legal relations   edit  Third parties Main article  Third party beneficiary The doctrine of privity of contract means that only those involved in striking a bargain would have standing to enforce it  In general this is still the case  only parties to a contract may sue for the breach of a contract  although in recent years the rule of privity has eroded somewhat and third party beneficiaries have been allowed to recover damages for breaches of contracts they were not party to citation needed   In cases where facts involve third party beneficiaries or debtors to the original contracting party have been allowed to be considered parties for purposes of enforcement of the contract  A recent advance has been seen in the case law as well as statutory recognition to the dilution of the doctrine of privity of contract  The recent tests applied by courts have been citation needed the test of benefit and the duty owed test  The duty owed test looks to see if the third party was agreeing to pay a debt for the original party needs elaboration  and whereas the benefit test looks to see if circumstances indicate that the promisee intends to give the beneficiary the benefit of the promised performance  Any defense allowed to parties of the original contract extend to third party beneficiaries  74  A recent example is in England  where the Contracts  Rights of Third Parties  Act 1999 was introduced   edit  Formalities and writing Main article  Statute of frauds An unwritten  unspoken contract  also known as  a contract implied by the acts of the parties   which can be either implied in fact or implied in law  may also be legally binding  Contracts implied in fact are  real  contracts  that is  of no different remedy than  benefit of the bargain   as mentioned above  However  contracts implied in law are also known as quasi contracts  and the remedy is quantum meruit  the fair market value of goods or services rendered  Oral contracts are ordinarily valid and therefore legally binding  31  However  in most jurisdictions  certain types of contracts must be reduced to writing to be enforceable  This is to prevent frauds and perjuries  hence the name statute of frauds  For example  an unwritten contract would be unenforceable if for the sale of land  Contracts that do not meet the requirements of common law or statutory Statutes of frauds are unenforceable  but are not necessarily thereby void  However  a party unjustly enriched by an unenforceable contract may be required to provide restitution for unjust enrichment  Statutes of frauds are typically codified in state statutes covering specific types of contracts  such as contracts for the sale of real estate  In Australia and many  if not all  jurisdictions which have adopted the common law of England  for contracts subject to legislation equivalent to the Statute of frauds  32  there is no requirement for the entire contract to be in writing  Although for property transactions there must be a note or memorandum evidencing the contract  which may come into existence after the contract has been formed  The note or memorandum must be signed in some way  and a series of documents may be used in place of a single note or memorandum  It must contain all material terms of the contract  the subject matter and the parties to the contract  In England and Wales  the common law Statute of frauds is only now in force for guarantees  which must be evidenced in writing  although the agreement may be made orally  Certain other kinds of contract must be in writing or they are void  for instance  for sale of land under s  52  Law of Property Act 1925  If a contract is in a written form  and somebody signs it  then the signer is typically bound by its terms regardless of whether he has actually read it  33  provided the document is contractual in nature  34  However  affirmative defenses such as duress or unconscionability may enable the signer to avoid his purported obligation  Furthermore  if a party wishes to use a document as the basis of a contract  reasonable notice of its terms must be given to the other party prior to their entry into the contract  35  This includes such things as tickets issued at parking stations  See also  Non est factum  edit  Bilateral and unilateral contracts Contracts may be bilateral or unilateral  A bilateral contract is an agreement in which each of the parties to the contract makes a promise or set of promises to the other party or parties  For example  in a contract for the sale of a home  the buyer promises to pay the seller  200 000 in exchange for the seller s promise to deliver title to the property  In a unilateral contract  only one party to the contract makes a promise  A typical example is the reward contract  A promises to pay a reward to B if B finds A s dog  B is not under an obligation to find A s dog  but A is under an obligation to pay the reward to B if B does find the dog  The consideration for the contract here is B s reliance on A s promise or B giving up his legal right to do whatever he wanted at the time he was engaged in the finding of the dog  In this example  the finding of the dog is a condition precedent to A s obligation to pay  although it is not a legal condition precedent  because technically no contract here has arisen until the dog is found  because B has not accepted A s offer until he finds the dog  and a contract requires offer  acceptance  and consideration   and the term  condition precedent  is used in contract law to designate a condition of a promise in a contract  For example  if B promised to find A s dog  and A promised to pay B when the dog was found  A s promise would have a condition attached to it  and offer and acceptance would already have occurred  This is a situation in which a condition precedent is attached to a bilateral contract  Condition precedents can also be attached to unilateral contracts  however  This would require A to require a further condition to be met before he pays B for finding his dog  So  for example  A could say  If anyone finds my dog  and the sky falls down  I will give that person  100   In this situation  even if the dog is found by B  he would not be entitled to the  100 until the sky falls down  Therefore the sky falling down is a condition precedent to A s duty being actualized  even though they are already in a contract  since A has made an offer and B has accepted  An offer of a unilateral contract may often be made to many people  or  to the world   by means of an advertisement   The general rule is that advertisements are not offers   In the situation where the unilateral offer is made to many people  acceptance will only occur on complete performance of the condition  in other words  by completing the performance that the offeror seeks  which is what the advertisement requests from the offerees   to actually find the dog   If the condition is something that only one party can perform  both the offeror and offeree are protected   the offeror is protected because he will only ever be contractually obliged to one of the many offerees  and the offeree is protected because if she does perform the condition  the offeror will be contractually obligated to pay her  In unilateral contracts  the requirement that acceptance be communicated to the offeror is waived unless otherwise stated in the offer  The offeree accepts by performing the condition  and the offeree s performance is also treated as the price  or consideration  for the offeror s promise  The offeror is master of the offer  it is he who decides whether the contract will be unilateral or bilateral  In unilateral contracts  the offer is made to the public at large  A bilateral contract is one in which there are duties on both sides  rights on both sides  and consideration on both sides  If an offeror makes an offer such as  If you promise to paint my house  I will give you  100   this is a bilateral contract once the offeree accepts  Each side has promised to do something  and each side will get something in return for what they have done   edit  Uncertainty  incompleteness and severance If the terms of the contract are uncertain or incomplete  the parties cannot have reached an agreement in the eyes of the law  36  An agreement to agree does not constitute a contract  and an inability to agree on key issues  which may include such things as price or safety  may cause the entire contract to fail  However  a court will attempt to give effect to commercial contracts where possible  by construing a reasonable construction of the contract  37  Courts may also look to external standards  which are either mentioned explicitly in the contract 38  or implied by common practice in a certain field  39  In addition  the court may also imply a term  if price is excluded  the court may imply a reasonable price  with the exception of land  and second hand goods  which are unique  If there are uncertain or incomplete clauses in the contract  and all options in resolving its true meaning have failed  it may be possible to sever and void just those affected clauses if the contract includes a severability clause  The test of whether a clause is severable is an objective test whether a reasonable person would see the contract standing even without the clauses  See also  Contra proferentem  edit  Contractual terms Main article  Contractual term A contractual term is  an y  provision forming part of a contract   40  Each term gives rise to a contractual obligation  breach of which can give rise to litigation  Not all terms are stated expressly and some terms carry less legal weight as they are peripheral to the objectives of the contract   edit  Boilerplate As discussed in Tina L  Stark s Negotiating and Drafting Contract Boilerplate  when lawyers refer to a  boilerplate  provision  they are referring to any standardized   one size fits all  contract provision  But lawyers also use the term in a more narrow context to refer to certain provisions that appear at the end of the contract  Typically  these provisions tell the parties how to govern their relationship and administer the contract  Although often thought to be of secondary importance  these provisions have significant business and legal consequences  41  Common provisions include the governing law provision  venue  assignment and delegation provisions  waiver of jury trial provisions  notice provisions  and force majeure provisions  42   edit  Classification of term Condition or warranty  43  Conditions are terms which go to the very root of a contract  Breach of these terms repudiates the contract  allowing the other party to discharge the contract  A warranty is not so imperative so the contract will subsist after a warranty breach  Breach of either will give rise to damages  It is an objective matter of fact whether a term goes to the root of a contract  By way of illustration  an actress  obligation to perform the opening night of a theatrical production is a condition  44  whereas a singer s obligation to perform during the first three days of rehearsal is a warranty  45  Statute may also declare a term or nature of term to be a condition or warranty  for example the Sale of Goods Act 1979 s15A 46  provides that terms as to title  description  quality and sample  as described in the Act  are conditions save in certain defined circumstances  Innominate term  Lord Diplock  in Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd  47  created the concept of an innominate term  breach of which may or not go to the root of the contract depending upon the nature of the breach  Breach of these terms  as with all terms  will give rise to damages  Whether or not it repudiates the contract depends upon whether legal benefit of the contract has been removed from the innocent party  Megaw LJ  in 1970  preferred the legal certainty of using the classic categories of condition or warranty  48  This was interpreted by the House of Lords as merely restricting its application in Reardon Smith Line Ltd  v Hansen Tangen  49   edit  Status as a term Status as a term is important as a party can only take legal action for the non fulfillment of a term as opposed to representations or mere puffery  Legally speaking  only statements that amount to a term create contractual obligations  There are various factor that a court may take into account in determining the nature of a statement  In particular  the importance apparently placed on the statement by the parties at the time the contract is made is likely to be significant  In Bannerman v  White 50  it was held a term of a contract for sale and purchase of hops that they had not been treated with sulphur  since the buyer made very explicit his unwillingness to accept hops so treated  saying that he had no use for them  The relative knowledge of the parties may also be a factor  as in Bissett v  Wilkinson 51  in which a statement that farmland being sold would carry 2000 sheep if worked by one team was held merely a representation  it was also only an opinion and therefore not actionable as misrepresentation   The reason this was not a term was that the seller had no basis for making the statement  as the buyer knew  and the buyer was prepared to rely on his own and his son s knowledge of farming   edit  Implied terms A term may either be express or implied  An express term is stated by the parties during negotiation or written in a contractual document  Implied terms are not stated but nevertheless form a provision of the contract   edit  Terms implied in fact Terms may be implied due to the facts of the proceedings by which the contract was formed  In the Australian case of BP Refinery Westernport v  Shire of Hastings 52  the UK Privy Council proposed a five stage test to determine situations where the facts of a case may imply terms  this only applies to formal contracts in Australia   53  However  the English Court of Appeal sounded a note of caution with regard to the BP case in Philips Electronique Grand Public SA v  British Sky Broadcasting Ltd 54  in which the Master of the Rolls described the test as  almost misleading  in its simplicity  55  The classic tests have been the  business efficacy test  and the  officious bystander test   The first of these was proposed by Lord Justice Bowen in The Moorcock  56  This test requires that a term can only be implied if it is necessary to give business efficacy to the contract to avoid such a failure of consideration that the parties cannot as reasonable businessmen have intended  But only the most limited term should then be implied   the bare minimum to achieve this goal  The officious bystander test derives its name from the judgment of Lord Justice Mackinnon in Shirlaw v  Southern Foundries  1926  Ltd 57  but the test actually originates in the judgment of Lord Justice Scrutton in Reigate v  Union Manufacturing Co  Ramsbottom  Ltd 58  This test is that a term can only be implied in fact if it is such a term that had an  officious bystander  listening to the contract negotiations suggested that they should include this term the parties would  dismiss him with a common  Oh of course     It is at least questionable whether this is truly a separate test or just a description of how one might go about arriving at a decision on the basis of the business efficacy test  Some jurisdictions  notably Australia  Israel and India  imply a term of good faith into contracts  A final way in which terms may be implied due to fact is through a previous course of dealing or common trade practice  The Uniform Commercial Code of the United States also imposes an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in performance and enforcement of contracts covered by the Code  which cannot be derogated from   edit  Terms implied in law Implied terms also a contract These are terms that have been implied into standardized relationships  Instances of this are quite numerous  especially in employment contracts and shipping contracts   edit  Common law Liverpool City Council v  Irwin 59  established a term to be implied into all contracts between tenant and landlord in multi storey blocks that the landlord is obliged to take reasonable care to keep the common areas in a reasonable state of repair  These terms will be implied into all contracts of the same nature as a matter of law   edit  Statute law The rules by which many contracts are governed are provided in specialized statutes that deal with particular subjects  Most countries  for example  have statutes which deal directly with sale of goods  lease transactions  and trade practices  For example  most American states have adopted Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code  which regulates contracts for the sale of goods  The most important legislation implying terms under United Kingdom law are the Sale of Goods Act 1979  the Consumer Protection  Distance Selling  Regulations 2000 and the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 which imply terms into all contracts whereby goods are sold or services provided   edit  Coercive vs  voluntary contractive exchanges There are a few ways of determining whether a contract has been coerced or is voluntary  Moral consideration  Objective consideration of right or wrong outside of the objective cause  or the perceived cause  Example  X  event  occurs every day at 5 pm  X is wrong  Anything that avoids X is good  allowing X  even if all parties agree  is bad  Phenomenological consideration   what models did the participants have which influenced the perception of what was to occur or what had occurred  Example  I observe X  Y  events  every day at 5 pm  I contract against X  Today I did   did not see Y occur  Statistical consideration   did the participants have a statistical prediction  likelihood of an event occurring which is covered by the contract  Example  X  event  happens every day at 5 pm  I enter a contract to avoid X  X does or does not occur   edit  Setting aside the contract There can be four different ways in which contracts can be set aside  A contract may be deemed  void    voidable    unenforceable or  ineffective   Voidness implies that a contract never came into existence  Voidability implies that one or both parties may declare a contract ineffective at their wish  Unenforceability implies that neither party may have recourse to a court for a remedy  Ineffectiveness implies that the contract terminates by order of a court where a public body has failed to satisfy public procurement law  To rescind is to set aside or unmake a contract   edit  Misrepresentation Main article  Misrepresentation Misrepresentation means a false statement of fact made by one party to another party and has the effect of inducing that party into the contract  For example  under certain circumstances  false statements or promises made by a seller of goods regarding the quality or nature of the product that the seller has may constitute misrepresentation  A finding of misrepresentation allows for a remedy of rescission and sometimes damages depending on the type of misrepresentation  There are two types of misrepresentation in contract law  fraud in the factum and fraud in inducement  Fraud in the factum focuses on whether the party in question knew they were creating a contract  If the party did not know that they were entering into a contract  there is no meeting of the minds  and the contract is void  Fraud in inducement focuses on misrepresentation attempting to get the party to enter into the contract  Misrepresentation of a material fact  if the party knew the truth  that party would not have entered into the contract  makes a contract voidable  According to Gordon v Selico 60  it is possible to make a misrepresentation either by words or by conduct  although not everything said or done is capable of constituting a misrepresentation  Generally  statements of opinion or intention are not statements of fact in the context of misrepresentation  Both an order for specific performance and an injunction are discretionary remedies  originating for the most part in equity  Neither is available as of right and in most jurisdictions and most circumstances a court will not normally order specific performance  A contract for the sale of real property is a notable exception  In most jurisdictions  the sale of real property is enforceable by specific performance  Even in this case the defenses to an action in equity  such as laches  the bona fide purchaser rule  or unclean hands  may act as a bar to specific performance  Related to orders for specific performance  an injunction may be requested when the contract prohibits a certain action  Action for injunction would prohibit the person from performing the act specified in the contract   edit  Procedure In the United States  in order to obtain damages for breach of contract or to obtain specific performance or other equitable relief  the aggrieved injured party may file a civil  non criminal  lawsuit in state court  unless there is diversity of citizenship giving rise to federal jurisdiction   If the contract contains a valid arbitration clause  the aggrieved party must submit an arbitration claim in accordance with the procedures set forth in the clause  Many contracts provide that all disputes arising thereunder will be resolved by arbitration  rather than litigated in courts  Customer claims against securities brokers and dealers are almost always resolved by arbitration because securities dealers are required  under the terms of their membership in self regulatory organizations such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority  formerly the NASD  or NYSE to arbitrate disputes with their customers  The firms then began including arbitration agreements in their customer agreements  requiring their customers to arbitrate disputes  61  On the other hand  certain claims have been held to be non arbitrable if they implicate a public interest that goes beyond the narrow interests of the parties to the agreement  i e   claims that a party violated a contract by engaging in illegal anti competitive conduct or civil rights violations   Arbitration judgments may generally be enforced in the same manner as ordinary court judgments  However  arbitral decisions are generally immune from appeal in the United States unless there is a showing that the arbitrator s decision was irrational or tainted by fraud  Virtually all states have adopted the Uniform Arbitration Act to facilitate the enforcement of arbitrated judgments  Notably  New York State  where a sizable portion of major commercial agreements are executed and performed  has not adopted the Uniform Arbitration Act  62  In England and Wales  a contract may be enforced by use of a claim  disambiguation needed    or in urgent cases by applying for an interim injunction to prevent a breach  Likewise  in the United States  an aggrieved party may apply for injunctive relief to prevent a threatened breach of contract  where such breach would result in irreparable harm that could not be adequately remedied by money damages   edit  Other contract Online contracts  which are easily made  are usually valid on a smaller scale for a period of one to three months  while on a larger scale can last about five years  As with all things legal  especially in regards to the ever evolving Internet  general rules like length of validity have many exceptions  All cases are evaluated on their own merits  and those merits are defined by the facts presented in each instance  It is up to the owner of the site to do what it can to guarantee enforceability of its contracts  Though most people sign online contracts before reading the content citation needed   E signature laws have made the electronic contract and signature as legally valid as a paper contract  It has been estimated that roughly one hundred and ten electronic contracts are signed every second   edit  Contract theory Main article  Contract theory Contract theory is the body of legal theory that addresses normative and conceptual questions in contract law  One of the most important questions asked in contract theory is why contracts are enforced  One prominent answer to this question focuses on the economic benefits of enforcing bargains  Another approach  associated with Charles Fried  maintains that the purpose of contract law is to enforce promises  This theory is developed in Fried s book  Contract as Promise  Other approaches to contract theory are found in the writings of legal realists and critical legal studies theorists  More generally  writers have propounded Marxist and feminist interpretations of contract  Attempts at overarching understandings of the purpose and nature of contract as a phenomenon have been made  notably  relational contract theory  originally developed by U S  contracts scholars Ian Roderick Macneil and Stewart Macaulay  building at least in part on the contract theory work of U S  scholar Lon L  Fuller  while U S  scholars have been at the forefront of developing economic theories of contract focussing on questions of transaction cost and so called  efficient breach  theory  Another dimension of the theoretical debate in contract is its place within  and relationship to a wider law of obligations  Obligations have traditionally been divided into contracts  which are voluntarily undertaken and owed to a specific person or persons  and obligations in tort which are based on the wrongful infliction of harm to certain protected interests  primarily imposed by the law  and typically owed to a wider class of persons  Recently it has been accepted that there is a third category  restitutionary obligations  based on the unjust enrichment of the defendant at the plaintiff s expense  Contractual liability  reflecting the constitutive function of contract  is generally for failing to make things better  by not rendering the expected performance   liability in tort is generally for action  as opposed to omission  making things worse  and liability in restitution is for unjustly taking or retaining the benefit of the plaintiff s money or work  63  The common law describes the circumstances under which the law will recognise the existence of rights  privilege or power arising out of a promise   edit  See also Contract  conflict  Contract of sale Contract awarding Contracting Contractual clauses  category  Design by contract Document automation Estoppel
