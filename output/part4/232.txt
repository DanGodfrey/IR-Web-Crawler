wa  o m     is a state in the mountain region of the Western United States  Wyoming is the 10th most extensive  but the least populous and the 2nd least densely populated of the 50 States  The western two thirds of the state is covered mostly with the mountain ranges and rangelands in the foothills of the Eastern Rocky Mountains  while the eastern third of the state is high elevation prairie known as the High Plains  Cheyenne is the capital and the most populous city of Wyoming with a population of nearly 60 000 people within its city proper  Contents 1 Geography 1 1 Location and size 1 2

and 45 N  and longitude  104 3 W and 111 3 W  27  W and 34  W of the Washington Meridian   making the shape of the state a latitude longitude quadrangle  5  Wyoming is one of only three states  along with Colorado and Utah  to have borders along only straight latitudinal and longitudinal lines  rather than being defined by natural landmarks  Due to surveying inaccuracies during the 19th century  Wyoming s legal border deviates from the true latitude and longitude lines by up to half of a mile   8 km  in some spots  especially in the mountainous region along the 45th parallel  6  Wyoming is bordered on the north by Montana  on the east by South Dakota and Nebraska  on the south by Colorado  on the southwest by Utah  and on the west by Idaho  It is the tenth largest state in the United States in total area  containing 97 818 square miles  253 350 km2  and is made up of 23 counties  From the north border to the south border it is 276 miles  444 km   7  and from the east to the west border is 365 miles  587 km  at its south end and 342 miles  550 km  at the north end   edit  Mountain ranges The Great Plains meet the Rocky Mountains in Wyoming  The state is a great plateau broken by many mountain ranges  Surface elevations range from the summit of Gannett Peak in the Wind River Mountain Range  at 13 804 feet  4 207 m   to the Belle Fourche River valley in the state s northeast corner  at 3 125 feet  953 m   In the northwest are the Absaroka  Owl Creek  Gros Ventre  Wind River and the Teton ranges  In the north central are the Big Horn Mountains  in the northeast  the Black Hills  and in the southern region the Laramie  Snowy and Sierra Madre ranges  The Snowy Range in the south central part of the state is an extension of the Colorado Rockies in both geology and appearance  The Wind River Range in the west central part of the state is remote and includes more than 40 mountain peaks in excess of 13 000 ft  4 000 m  tall in addition to Gannett Peak  the highest peak in the state  The Big Horn Mountains in the north central portion are somewhat isolated from the bulk of the Rocky Mountains  Wyoming terrain The Teton Range in the northwest extends for 50 miles  80 km   part of which is included in Grand Teton National Park  The park includes the Grand Teton  the second highest peak in Wyoming  The Continental Divide spans north south across the central portion of the state  Rivers east of the divide drain into the Missouri River Basin and eventually the Gulf of Mexico  They are the North Platte  Wind  Big Horn and the Yellowstone rivers  The Snake River in northwest Wyoming eventually drains into the Columbia River and the Pacific Ocean  as does the Green River through the Colorado River Basin  The continental divide forks in the south central part of the state in an area known as the Great Divide Basin where the waters that flow or precipitate into this area remain there and cannot flow to any ocean  Instead  because of the overall aridity of Wyoming  water in the Great Divide Basin simply sinks into the soil or evaporates  Several rivers begin or flow through the state  including the Yellowstone River  Bighorn River  Green River  and the Snake River   edit  Islands Main article  List of islands of Wyoming  edit  Public lands Map of Wyoming  National Parks and NPS sites More than 48  of the land in Wyoming is owned by the U S  Government  leading Wyoming to rank sixth in the U S  in total acres and fifth in percentage of a state s land owned by the Federal government  8  This amounts to about 30 099 430 acres  121 808 1 km2  owned and managed by the U S  Government  The state government owns an additional 6  of all Wyoming lands  or another 3 864 800 acres  15 640 km2   8  The vast majority of this government land is managed by the Bureau of Land Management and U S  Forest Service in numerous National Forests  a National Grassland  and a number of vast swaths of public land  in addition to the F E  Warren Air Force Base near Cheyenne  In addition  Wyoming contains areas that are under the management of the National Park Service and other agencies  They include  An eruption of Castle Geyser in Yellowstone

Wyoming s climate is generally semi arid and continental  K ppen climate classification BSk   and is drier and windier in comparison to most of the United States with greater temperature extremes  Much of this is due to the topography of the state  Summers in Wyoming are warm with July high temperatures averaging between 85  F  29  C  and 95  F  35  C  in most of the state  With increasing elevation  however  this average drops rapidly with locations above 9 000 feet  2 700 m  averaging around 70  F  21  C   Summer nights throughout the state are characterized by a rapid cooldown with even the hottest locations averaging in the 50 60  F  10 16  C  range at night  In most of the state  most of the precipitation tends to fall in the late spring and early summer  Winters are cold  but are variable with periods of sometimes extreme cold interspersed between generally mild periods  with Chinook winds providing unusually warm temperatures in some locations  Wyoming is a dry state with much of the land receiving less than 10 inches  250 mm  of rainfall per year  Precipitation depends on elevation with lower areas in the Big Horn Basin averaging 5 8 inches  130 200 mm   making the area nearly a true desert   The lower areas in the North and on the eastern plains typically average around 10 12 inches  250 300 mm   making the climate there semi arid  Some mountain areas do receive a good amount of precipitation  20 inches  510 mm  or more  much of it as snow  sometimes 200 inches  510 cm  or more annually  The states highest recorded temperature is 114  F  46  C  at Basin on July 12  1900 and the lowest recorded temperature is  66  F   54  C  at Riverside on February 9  1933  The climate of any area in Wyoming is largely determined by its latitude  altitude and local topography  When put together  these factors have a lot to do with airflow patterns  temperature variations  precipitation and humidity brought in by the weather systems that migrate eastward  In winter  Wyoming is often beneath the jet stream  or north of it  which accounts for its frequent strong winds  blasts of Arctic air and precipitation  all the necessary ingredients for great snow conditions at Wyoming s northwestern ski areas  In summer  the jet stream retreats northward to Canada  leaving the state s weather mild and pleasant at a time when the majority of Wyoming s visitors choose to arrive  Jackson  located at 6 230 feet  1 900 m  above sea level and surrounded by mountains  can expect a high temperature in July of 80  F  27  C   The average is more likely to be 65  F  18  C   The closest National Weather Station  in Riverton on the other side of the Wind River Mountains at 4 955 feet  1 510 m   reports slightly warmer July weather  The number of thunderstorm days vary across the state with the southeastern plains of the state having the most days of thunderstorm activity  Thunderstorm activity in the state is highest during the late spring and early summer  The southeastern corner of the state is the most vulnerable part of the state to tornado activity  Moving away from that point and westwards  the incidence of tornadoes drops dramatically with the west part of the state showing little vulnerability  Tornadoes  where they occur  tend to be small and brief  unlike some of those that occur a little further east  Casper climate  Average maximum and

12 pounder mountain howitzer on display at Fort Laramie in eastern Wyoming  Several American Indian groups originally inhabited the region now known as Wyoming  The Crow  Arapaho  Lakota  and Shoshone were but a few of the original inhabitants encountered when white explorers first entered the region  What is now southwestern Wyoming became a part of the Spanish Empire and later Mexican territory of Alta California  until it was ceded to the United States in 1848 at the end of the Mexican American War  French Canadian trappers from Qu bec and Montr al have ventured into the state in the late 18th century  leaving French toponyms such as T ton  La Ramie  etc  John Colter  a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition  itself guided by French Canadian Toussaint Charbonneau and his young Shoshone wife  Sacagawea  first described the region in 1807  At the time  his reports of the Yellowstone area were considered to be fictional  Robert Stuart and a party of five men returning from Astoria discovered South Pass in 1812  The Oregon Trail later followed that route  In 1850  Jim Bridger located what is now known as Bridger Pass  which the Union Pacific Railroad used in 1868 as did Interstate 80  90 years later  Bridger also explored Yellowstone and filed reports on the region that  like those of Colter  were largely regarded as tall tales at the time  The region had acquired the name Wyoming by 1865  when Representative J  M  Ashley of Ohio introduced a bill to Congress to provide a  temporary government for the territory of Wyoming   The name Wyoming derives from the Munsee name xw  wam nk  meaning  at the big river flat   but also named after the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania  made famous by the 1809 poem Gertrude of Wyoming by Thomas Campbell  11  12  After the Union Pacific Railroad had reached the town of Cheyenne in 1867  the region s population began to grow steadily  and the federal government established the Wyoming Territory on July 25  1868  13  Unlike Colorado to the south  Wyoming enjoyed no significant discovery of such celebrated minerals as gold and silver nor Colorado s consequent boom in population although South Pass City experienced a short lived boom after the Carissa Mine began producing gold in 1867  14  Moreover  some areas  such as between the Sierra Madre Mountains and the Snowy Range near Grand Encampment  produced copper  15  Once government sponsored expeditions to the Yellowstone country were undertaken  the previous reports by men like Colter and Bridger were found to be true  This led to the creation of Yellowstone National Park  which became the world s first national park in 1872  Nearly all of Yellowstone National Park lies within the far northwestern borders of Wyoming  On December 10  1869  territorial Gov  John Allen Campbell signed a suffrage act into law  which extended the right to vote to women  And in addition to being the first U S  state to grant suffrage to women  Wyoming was also the home of other firsts for U S  women in politics  For the first time  women served on a jury in Wyoming  Laramie in 1870   Wyoming had the first female court bailiff  Mary Atkinson  Laramie  in 1870  and the first female justice of the peace in the country  Esther Hobart Morris  South Pass City  in 1870   Wyoming became the first state in the Union to elect a female governor  Nellie Tayloe Ross   Wyoming and Texas both elected a female governor at the same time  The Wyoming female Governor took office a few days before the one in Texas did  Source  History of Wyoming by Dr  T  A  Larsonwho was elected in 1924 and took office in January 1925  Because of rights given to women  Wyoming earned the nickname of  The Equality State   16  Wyoming s constitution included women s suffrage and a pioneering article on water rights  17  The United States admitted Wyoming into the Union as the 44th state on July 10  1890  16  Wyoming was the location of the Johnson County War of 1892  on which the controversial 1980 film Heaven s Gate was based  which erupted between competing groups of cattle ranchers  The passage of the federal Homestead Act led to an influx of small ranchers  A range war broke out when either or both of the groups chose violent conflict over commercial competition in the use of the public land  See  List of counties in Wyoming  edit  Demographics Historical

government  the executive  legislative  and judicial branches  The Wyoming state legislature comprises a House of Representatives with 60 members and a Senate with 30 members  The executive branch is headed by the governor and includes a secretary of state  auditor  treasurer and superintendent of public instruction  Wyoming does not have a lieutenant governor  Instead the secretary of state stands first in the line of succession  Wyoming s sparse population warrants it only a single at large seat in the U S  House of Representatives  and hence only three votes in the Electoral College  Its low population renders Wyoming voters effectively more powerful in presidential elections than those in more populous states  For example  while Montana had a 2000 census population of 902 195 to Wyoming s 493 782  they both have the same number of electoral votes  Wyoming is an alcoholic beverage control state   edit  Judicial system Wyoming s highest court is the Supreme Court of Wyoming  with five justices presiding over appeals from the state s lower courts  Wyoming is unusual in that it does not have an intermediate appellate court  like most states  This is largely attributable to the state s size and correspondingly lower caseload  Appeals from the state district courts go directly to the Wyoming Supreme Court  Wyoming also has state circuit courts  formerly county courts   of limited jurisdiction  which handle certain types of cases  such as civil claims with lower dollar amounts  misdemeanor criminal offenses  and felony arraignments  Circuit court judges also commonly hear small claims cases as well  All state court judges in Wyoming are nominated by the Judicial Nominating Commission and appointed by the Governor  They are then subject to a retention vote by the electorate   edit  Politics Presidential elections results 33  Year Republicans Democrats 2008 64 78  164 958 32 54  82 868 2004 68 86  167 629 29 07  70 776 2000 67 76  147 947 27 70  60 481 1996 49

the first to grant women the right to vote and to elect a woman governor  While the state elected notable Democrats to federal office in the 1960s and 1970s  politics have become decidedly more conservative since the 1980s as the Republican party came to dominate the state s congressional delegation  Today  Wyoming is represented in Washington by its two Senators  Mike Enzi and John Barrasso  and its one member of the House of Representatives  Congresswoman Cynthia Lummis  All three are Republicans  The state has not voted for a Democrat for president since 1964  one of only five times since statehood  At present  there are only two relatively reliably Democratic counties  affluent Teton and college county Albany  In the 2004 presidential election  George W  Bush won his second largest victory  with 69  of the vote  Former Vice President Dick Cheney is a Wyoming resident and represented the state in Congress from 1979 to 1989  Republicans are no less dominant at the state level  They have held a majority in the state senate continuously since 1936 and in the state house since 1964  However  Democrats have held the governorship for all but eight years between 1975 and 2011  Uniquely  Wyoming elected Democrat Nellie Tayloe Ross as the first woman in U S  history to serve as state governor  She served from 1925 to 1927 after winning a special election after her husband  governor at the time  unexpectedly died  34  Further information  Political party strength in Wyoming  edit  Counties The State of Wyoming has 23 counties  Wyoming Counties Ranked By 2009
