mutant who possesses animal keen senses  enhanced physical capabilities  three retracting bone claws on each hand and a healing factor that allows him to recover from virtually any wound  disease or toxin at an accelerated rate  The healing factor also slows down his aging process  enabling him to live beyond a normal human lifespan  His powerful healing factor enabled the supersoldier program Weapon X to bond the near indestructible metal alloy adamantium to his skeleton and claws without killing him  He is most often depicted as a member of the X Men  Alpha Flight  or later the Avengers  The character first appeared in the last panel of The Incredible Hulk  180  his first full appearance is in issue  181  November 1974  and was created by writer Len Wein and Marvel art director John Romita  Sr   who designed the character  and was first drawn for publication by Herb Trimpe  Wolverine later joined the X Men s  All New  All Different  roster in Giant Size X Men  1  May 1975   X Men writer Chris Claremont played a significant role in the character s subsequent development  2  along with artist writer John Byrne  who insisted on making the character older than the other X Men  Artist Frank Miller collaborated with Claremont and helped to revise the character with a four part eponymous limited series from September to December 1982 in which Wolverine s catchphrase   I m the best there is at what I do  but what I do best isn t very nice   debuted  Wolverine was typical of the many tough  anti authority  antiheroes that emerged in American popular culture after the Vietnam War  3  his willingness to use deadly force and his brooding nature became standard characteristics for comic book anti heroes by the end of the 1980s  4  As a result  the character became the clear favorite for fans of the increasingly popular X Men franchise  5  Wolverine has been featured in his own solo comic since 1988 and has been a central character in most X Men adaptations  including animated television series  video games  and the live action 20th Century Fox X Men film series  in which he is portrayed by Hugh Jackman  6  In May 2008  Wolverine was ranked  1 out of Wizard magazine s Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time 7  and was ranked as the 4th Greatest Comic Book Character by Empire magazine in July 2008  8  On their list of the 100 Greatest Fictional Characters  Fandomania com ranked Wolverine at  21  9  In May 2011  Wolverine was ranked 4th on IGN s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes  10  Contents 1 Publication history 1 1 Wolverine s first intended

Publication history Wolverine made his debut in The Incredible Hulk  181  November 1974   Art by Herb Trimpe  Wolverine first appeared in the final  teaser  panel of The Incredible Hulk  180  cover date October 1974  written by Len Wein and penciled by Herb Trimpe  The character then appeared in a number of advertisements in various Marvel Comics publications before making his first major appearance in The Incredible Hulk  181  cover date November 1974  again by Wein and Trimpe  John Romita  Sr   designed Wolverine s yellow and blue costume  The character s introduction was ambiguous  revealing little beyond his being a superhuman agent of the Canadian government  In these appearances  he does not retract his claws  although Len Wein stated they had always been envisaged as retractable  11  He appears briefly in the finale to this story in The Incredible Hulk  182  Wolverine s next appearance was in 1975 s Giant Size X Men  1  written by Wein and penciled by Dave Cockrum  in which Wolverine is recruited for a new squad  Gil Kane illustrated the cover artwork but incorrectly drew Wolverine s mask with larger headpieces  Dave Cockrum liked Kane s accidental alteration  believing it to be similar to Batman s mask  and incorporated it into his own artwork for the actual story  12  Cockrum was also the first artist to draw Wolverine without his mask  and the distinctive hairstyle became a trademark of the character  2  A revival of X Men followed  beginning with X Men  94  August 1975   drawn by Cockrum and written by Chris Claremont  In X Men and Uncanny X Men  Wolverine is initially overshadowed by the other characters  although he does create tension in the team as he is attracted to Cyclops  girlfriend  Jean Grey  As the series progressed  Claremont and Cockrum  who preferred Nightcrawler 13   considered dropping Wolverine from the series  13  Cockrum s successor  artist John Byrne  championed the character  later explaining  as a Canadian himself  he did not want to see a Canadian character dropped  2  14  Byrne created Alpha Flight  a group of Canadian superheroes who try to recapture Wolverine due to the expense their government incurred training him  Later stories gradually establish Wolverine s murky past and unstable nature  which he battles to keep in check  Byrne also designed a new brown and tan costume for Wolverine  but retained the distinctive Cockrum cowl  Following Byrne s departure  Wolverine remained in X Men  The character s growing popularity led to a solo  four issue  Wolverine  September   December 1982   by Claremont and Frank Miller  followed by the six issue Kitty Pryde and Wolverine by Claremont and Al Milgrom  November 1984   April 1985   Marvel launched an ongoing solo book written by Claremont with art by John Buscema in November 1988  It ran for 189 issues  Larry Hama later took over the series and had an extensive run  Other writers who wrote for the two Wolverine ongoing series include Peter David  Archie Goodwin  Erik Larsen  Frank Tieri  Greg Rucka  and Mark Millar  Many artists have also worked on the series  including John Byrne  Marc Silvestri  Mark Texeira  Adam Kubert  Leinil Francis Yu  Rob Liefeld  Sean Chen  Darick Robertson  John Romita  Jr   and Humberto Ramos  During the 1990s  the character was revealed to have bone claws  after his adamantium is ripped out by Magneto in X Men  25  which was inspired by a passing joke of Peter David s  15  In addition to the Wolverine series and appearances in the various X Men series  two other storylines expand upon the character s past   Weapon X   by writer artist Barry Windsor Smith  serialized in Marvel Comics Presents  72 84  1991   and Origin  a six issue limited series by co writers Joe Quesada  Paul Jenkins  and Bill Jemas and artist Andy Kubert  November 2001   July 2002   A second solo series  Wolverine  Origins  written by Daniel Way with art by Steve Dillon  spun off of  and runs concurrently with  the second Wolverine solo series   edit  Wolverine s first intended origin Despite suggestions that co creator Len Wein originally intended for Logan to be a mutated wolverine cub  evolved to humanoid form by the High Evolutionary  16  Wein denies this    While I readily admit that my original idea was for Wolvie s claws to extend from the backs of his gloves     I absolutely did not ever intend to make Logan a mutated wolverine  I write stories about human beings  not evolved animals  with apologies for any story I may have written that involved the High Evolutionary   The mutated wolverine thing came about long after I was no longer involved with the book  I m not certain if the idea was first suggested by Chris Claremont  the late  much missed Dave Cockrum  or John Byrne when he came aboard as artist  but it most certainly did not start with me  17    Wein has stated in a conversation with Stan Lee included on the X Men Origins  Wolverine blu ray special features that he has read  Ten things you did not know about Wolverine   which states that he was originally intended to be a mutated wolverine cub  and this re kindled Wein s frustration  He again stated that he had  always known that Wolverine was a mutant   citation needed  In X Men  98  April 1976   a biological analysis of Wolverine suggests that he was in some way different from the other X Men  and in X Men  103  Wolverine says he does not believe in leprechauns  to which the leprechaun replies   Maybe leprechauns don t believe in talkin  wolverines  either   18  In an article about the evolution of Wolverine included in a 1986 reprint of The Incredible Hulk  180 181  titled Incredible Hulk and Wolverine  Cockrum is quoted as saying that he considered having the High Evolutionary play a vital role in making Wolverine a human  2  Writer Wein wanted Wolverine to be the age of a young adult  with superhuman strength and agility similar to Spider Man  This changed when Wein saw Cockrum s drawing of the unmasked Wolverine as a hairy 40 year old  2  Wein originally intended the claws to be retractable and part of Wolverine s gloves  and both gloves and claws would be made of adamantium  17  Chris Claremont eventually revealed that they were an integrated part of Wolverine s anatomy in X Men  98  April 1976   Writer Jeph Loeb used a similar origin for Wolverine in the Marvel continuity  having feral mutants be an evolved lifeform  19   edit  Wolverine s second intended origin John Byrne said in interviews and on his website that he drew a possible face for Wolverine  but then learned that John Romita  Sr   had already drawn one that Dave Cockrum used in X Men  98  April 1976   long before Byrne s run on the series  20  21  Later  Byrne used the drawing for the face of Sabretooth  an enemy of the martial artist superhero Iron Fist  whose stories Chris Claremont was writing  Byrne then had the idea of Sabretooth being Wolverine s father  22  23  Together  Byrne and Claremont came up with Wolverine being approximately 60 years old and having served in World War II after escaping from Sabretooth  who was approximately 120 years old  22  The plan had been for Wolverine to have been almost crushed in an accident  he would discover  when attempting to stand for the first time after recovering  that his healing factor does not work on bones  and his legs immediately break  He then spends over a decade in a hospital bed  almost going mad  when the Canadian government approaches him with the idea of replacing his skeleton one bone at a time with adamantium  the claws being a surprise  This origin  too  was never used   edit  Fictional character biography Wolverine first uses his claws in Origin  2  Art by Andy Kubert and Richard Isanove  As shown in the 2001 2002 miniseries Origin  Wolverine was born as James Howlett in Alberta  Canada  in the mid 1880s  to rich farm owners  The character grows into manhood on a mining colony in Northern British Columbia  adopting the name  Logan   24  Logan leaves the colony and lives for a time in the wilderness among wolves  until returning to civilization  residing with the Blackfoot Indians  Following the death of his Blackfoot lover  Silver Fox  he is ushered into the Canadian military during World War I  Logan then spends some time in Madripoor  before settling in Japan  where he marries Itsu and has a son  Daken  During World War II  Logan teams up with Captain America and continues a career as a soldier of fortune adventurer  He then serves with the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion 25  during D Day  and the CIA  before being recruited by Team X  a black ops unit  As a member of Team X  Logan is given false memory implants  He continues on the team  until he is able to break free of the mental control and joins the Canadian Defense Ministry  Logan is subsequently kidnapped by the Weapon X program  where he remains captive and experimented on  until he escapes  as shown in Barry Windsor Smith s  Weapon X  storyline which ran in Marvel Comics Presents  It is during his imprisonment by Weapon X that he has unbreakable adamantium forcibly fused onto his bones  Logan is eventually discovered by James and Heather Hudson  who help him recover his humanity  Following his recovery  Logan  this time under the supervision of Department H  once again works as an intelligence operative for the Canadian government  Logan becomes Wolverine  one of Canada s first superheroes  In his first mission  he is dispatched to stop the destruction caused by a brawl between the Hulk and the Wendigo  26  Later on  Professor Charles Xavier recruits Wolverine to a new team of X Men  Disillusioned with his Canadian intelligence work and intrigued by Xavier s offer  Logan resigns from Department H  27  It was later revealed  however  that Professor X had wiped Logan s memories and forced him to join the X Men after Wolverine was sent to assassinate Xavier  28  In X Men  25  1993   at the culmination of the  Fatal Attractions  crossover  the supervillain Magneto forcibly removes the adamantium from Wolverine s skeleton  This massive trauma causes his healing factor to burn out and also leads to the discovery that his claws are actually bone  Wolverine leaves the X Men for a time  embarking on a series of adventures during which his healing factor returns  greatly increased in speed and efficiency  due to the fact that the adamantium in his bones used a considerable amount of his healing factor on a constant basis   It is also realised at this time that Wolverine constantly mutates  unlike other mutants  and that the adamantium slowed his mutation to a halt  His natural abilities such as healing factor and animalistic senses increase slowly over time  Feral by nature  Wolverine s mutation process will eventually cause him to degenerate physically into a more primitive  bestial state  volume  amp  issue needed  After his return to the X Men  Cable s son Genesis kidnaps Wolverine and attempts to re bond adamantium to his skeleton  29  This is unsuccessful and causes Wolverine s mutation to accelerate out of control  He is temporarily changed into a semi sentient beast like form in which he gains greater physical power than ever before  at the price of part of his humanity  Eventually  the villain Apocalypse captures Wolverine  brainwashes him into becoming the Horseman Death  and successfully re bonds adamantium to his skeleton  Wolverine overcomes Apocalypse s programming and returns to the X Men  In 2005  author Brian Michael Bendis had Wolverine join the Avengers  After the miniseries House of M  Wolverine regains his memories and prepares to seek out and enact vengeance on those who wronged him  In Wolverine  Origins  the character s second solo series  Wolverine discovers that he has a son named Daken  who has been brainwashed and made a living weapon by the villain Romulus  the man behind Wolverine s own brainwashing  Wolverine then makes it his mission to rescue Daken and stop Romulus from manipulating or harming anyone again  During the events of the Messiah Complex storyline  Cyclops orders Wolverine to reform X Force  Since then  Wolverine and the team  initially consisting of X 23  Warpath  and Wolfsbane  have starred in a new monthly title  The team was also featured in the  Messiah War  storyline  a sequel to Messiah Complex  After the events of Second Coming  Cyclops ends the X Force program  but Wolverine continues a new X Force team in secrecy with Angel Archangel  Psylocke  Deadpool and Fantomex  In 2008  writer Mark Millar and artist Steve McNiven explored a possible future for Wolverine in an eight issue story arc entitled  Old Man Logan  that debuted with Wolverine  66  Millar  the writer for the story  said   It s The Dark Knight Returns for Wolverine  essentially  The big  wide  show stopping series that plays around with the most popular Marvel character of the last forty years  a dystopian vision of the Marvel Universe and a unique look at their futures  The heroes have gone  the villains have won and we re two generations away from the Marvel we know   30  In X Men  5  it is revealed that in order for Wolverine to fully infiltrate the ranks of the vampires that were attacking Utopia at the behest of Dracula s son  when Wolverine thought the vampire virus had simply bested his healing factor   Cyclops has to infect him with nanites that are capable of shutting off Wolverine s healing factor  Cyclops can activate them by merely clicking a button on a remote control device he carries with him at all times  31   edit  Wolverine Goes to Hell A group known as the Red Right Hand is a group of people who have been wronged by Wolverine and have sworn revenge on him  They trick him to try to save his recent girlfriend Melita Garner  who was Mystique in disguise  and then trap him in a mystical circle to send him straight to Hell  While he is in Hell  a group of demons possess Wolverine s body  The demons then attack Wraith while he is at church  then they attack Colossus  The Red Right Hand then start to kill off people that Wolverine knows  like the Silver Samurai  While in Hell  Wolverine finally confronts his biological father  Thomas Logan  He is reunited as well with various people he has either killed or died because of him  both foes  led by Sabretooth  and friends  Wolverine manages to escape from Hell with the help of Melita  Daimon Hellstrom  and the Ghost Rider  32  However  his body is still possessed by the demons  The X Men find out about Wolverine is possessed and decide that he should die to protect humankind  believing Wolverine would prefer to die rather than kill innocents  Wolverine is attacked on all sides by fighting the demons that still possess him and the X Men that want him killed  He subsequently tracks down the Red Right Hand and kills their team of killers  the Mongrels  Wolverine fights his way through them only to find that the Red Right Hand s members have all committed suicide  while a pre recorded message reveals that the Mongrels were all his illegitimate children  Unable to seek vengeance  Logan drags his children to the graves of their mothers before abandoning the world altogether  33  Broken and depressed  Wolverine secludes himself in the frozen wilderness and travels with a pack of wolves  eating little scraps of what s left of their kills  Poachers find the pack and capture any wolves that are young enough to fight  Wolverine goes to find his pack and kills the poachers  As he debates going back to the wild and hiding in deeper seclusion  he finds injured children who the poachers were using to fight wolves for sport  Wolverine returns the children to their families only to be found by Melita and his allies who convince him to come back to civilization  34  Sometime afterwards  the events of Fear Itself and before Schism take place   edit  Schism At the beginning of the events of Schism  Cyclops thanks Wolverine for always being there for him as they seem to finally have come to a mutually spoken and understood respect for each other after years of fighting and rivalry  While at a conference for weapon control  Kid Omega  Quentin Quire  launches a psychic terrorist attack on the ambassadors present  In response  Sentinels are deployed at the conference and are disposed of by Cyclops and Wolverine  Due to growing fears of mutant threat  countries around the world begin to mobilize their Sentinel forces  As Cyclops begins to deploy X Men around the globe to deal with the threat  Wolverine returns to Utopia to find Hope Summers and the Lights waiting for their combat training lesson  After insulting Hope s team and realizing that Idie is losing her childhood  Wolverine asks Kitty Pryde to make him a doll to give to Idie  Wolverine gives the doll to Idie and eats ice cream with her while news reports of Sentinel activity play and tensions build around Utopia  Sometime after  Kid Omega shows up on Utopia  Wolverine tries to attack Kid Omega when Cyclops stops him  While Cyclops sends a team of some of his most powerful X Men  as well as some of the island students  to a local mutant museum exhibit as a  show of force   Wolverine goes to a local bar to sulk in his aggravation with the current situation  The new Hellfire Club attacks the exhibit and incapacitate all senior X Men present  As Wolverine rushes to the museum to help from the bar and Cyclops flies in from Utopia  Idie asks if she should kill the Hellfire Club to help  While Wolverine protests against it profusely  Cyclops tells Idie to do what she feels is right  Idie kills almost every Hellfire Club member left to save her friends and mentors  Wolverine pops his claws at Cyclops in anger that he used a child to save the day  but restrains himself when he realizes what he s doing  35  From the wreckage of the museum  a sentinel begins to form  While Wolverine tries to stop the sentinel from maturing  he is thrown into the ocean  Shortly after  Wolverine swims on to Utopia and tells the mutant children that they need to leave  Cyclops tells the students to fight together and that they can beat the sentinel  but Wolverine objects to using children to fight battles  Cyclops doesn t listen and begins to prepare the students for combat  Shortly after Wolverine returns with a detonator to blow up Utopia and orders all remaining people on the island to evacuate  Cyclops and Wolverine s frustration with each other come to a head when Cyclops brings up Jean Grey saying that she never loved Wolverine and always feared him  Wolverine replies  And if she were here right now  who do you think she would be more frightened of   The two fight each other in a rage while being attacked by the sentinel and as Wolverine claws into Cyclops visor  the students reappear on the battlefield to help them fight the sentinel  In the morning  Cyclops and Wolverine stand victorious with the students all living  but Wolverine can t continue watching Cyclops use children as soldiers to fight these battles  Wolverine announces his departure from Utopia and indicates he will take any mutant on the island who wants to leave with him  While Wolverine doesn t leave as an enemy of Cyclops and his X Men  he makes clear he wants both sides to stay out of the others business  36  Wolverine returns to Westchester  New York to open a new school  the  Jean Grey School for Higher Learning   37   edit  Regenesis After the Schism  around half of all the mutants on Utopia accompany Wolverine to Westchester to be a part of the new school  He appoints himself as the headmaster  Kitty Pryde as the co headmistress  Hank McCoy as the vice principal  and various other characters such as Rogue  Cannonball  Iceman  Rachel Grey  and Gambit are appointed as the school s staff  Even Toad is appointed  as a janitor  The first issue focuses on the state education board visiting to approve of their school application  As Logan and Kitty give the delegation a tour  Kade Kilgore shows up and tells Logan that he is the one who caused the Schism and he will destroy all that Logan has worked to build up  38   edit  Powers and abilities Wolverine is a mutant with a number of both natural and artificial improvements to his physiology  His primary mutant power is an accelerated healing process  typically referred to as his mutant healing factor  that regenerates damaged or destroyed tissues of his body far beyond the capabilities of an ordinary human  This power facilitated the artificial improvements he was subjected to under the Weapon X program  in later comics called the Weapon Plus program   in which his skeleton was reinforced with the virtually indestructible metal adamantium  Depictions of the speed and extent of injury to which Wolverine can heal vary  Originally  this was portrayed as accelerated healing of minor wounds  39  but writers have steadily increased this ability over the years  After several years  Wolverine s healing factor was depicted as healing severe wounds within a matter of days or hours  40  41  Other writers went on to increase Wolverine s healing factor to the point that it could fully regenerate nearly any damaged or destroyed bodily tissues within seconds  42  43  44  Among the more extreme depictions of Wolverine s healing factor include fully healing after being caught near the center of an atomic explosion 45  and the total regeneration of his soft body tissue  within a matter of minutes  after having it incinerated from his skeleton  46  It has been stated in the Xavier Protocols  a series of profiles created by Xavier that lists the strengths and weaknesses of the X Men  that Wolverine s healing factor is increased to  incredible levels  and theorizes that the only way to stop him is to decapitate him and remove his head from the vicinity of his body  47  It s possible for the efficiency of his healing powers to be suppressed  For example  if an object composed of carbonadium is inserted and remains lodged within his body  his healing powers are slowed dramatically though they are not fully suppressed  48  His healing factor can also be greatly suppressed by the Muramasa blade  a katana of mystic origins that can inflict wounds that nullify superhuman healing factors  49  His healing factor also dramatically slows his aging process  allowing him to live beyond the normal lifespan of a human  Despite being born in the late 19th century  50  he has the appearance and vitality of a man in his physical prime  It is unknown exactly how greatly his healing factor extends his life expectancy  Though he now has all of his memories  his healing abilities can provide increased recovery from psychological trauma by suppressing memories in which he experiences profound distress  51  In addition to accelerated healing of physical traumas  Wolverine s healing factor makes him extraordinarily resistant to diseases  drugs  and toxins  However  he can still suffer the immediate effects of such substances in massive quantities  he has been shown to become intoxicated after significant amounts of alcohol  52  and has been incapacitated on several occasions with large amounts of powerful drugs and poisons  53 S H I E L D  once managed to keep Wolverine anesthetized by constantly pumping eighty milliliters of anesthetic a minute into his system  54  Although his body heals  the healing factor does not suppress the pain he endures while injured  55  Wolverine also admits to feeling phantom pains for weeks or months after healing from his injuries  volume  amp  issue needed  He does not enjoy being hurt and sometimes has to work himself up for situations where extreme pain is certain  56  57  Wolverine  on occasion  has deliberately injured himself or allowed himself to be injured for varying reasons  including freeing himself from capture  58  intimidation  59  strategy  60  or simply indulging his feral nature  61  62  63  Wolverine s mutation also consists of animal like adaptations of his body  including pronounced  and sharp fang like canines and three retractable claws housed within each forearm  While originally depicted as bionic implants created by the Weapon X program  64  the claws are later revealed to be a natural part of his body  65  The claws are not made of keratin  as claws tend to be in the animal kingdom  but extremely dense bone  and  with their adamantium coating  can cut substances as durable as most metals  wood  and some varieties of stone  They can also be used to block attacks or projectiles  as well as dig into surfaces allowing Wolverine to climb structures  66  Wolverine s hands do not have openings for the claws to move through  they cut through his flesh every time he extrudes them  with occasional references implying that he feels a brief moment of slight pain in his hands when he unsheathes them  67  On more than one occasion  Wolverine s entire skeleton  including his claws  has been molecularly infused with adamantium  Due to their coating  his claws can cut almost any known solid material  The only known exceptions are adamantium itself and Captain America s shield  which is made out of an iron vibranium alloy  Vibranium alone is not comparable in terms of durability with adamantium  seeing as Colossus has broken it  Wolverine s ability to slice completely through a substance depends upon both the amount of force he can exert and the thickness of the substance  The adamantium also weights his blows  increasing the effectiveness of his offensive capabilities  40  However  this also makes him exceptionally susceptible to magnetic based attacks  68  Also  while the adamantium is in his body his healing factor must work constantly to prevent the metal poisoning from killing him  with the result that his ability to heal is slightly lessened compared to what he would be capable of normally  Wolverine s healing factor also affects a number of his physical attributes by increasing them to superhuman levels  His stamina is sufficiently heightened to the point he can exert himself for numerous hours  even after exposure to powerful tranquilizers  69  Wolverine s agility and reflexes are also enhanced to levels that are beyond the physical limits of the finest human athlete  70  71  Due to his healing factor s constant regenerative qualities  he can push his muscles beyond the limits of the human body without injury  72  This  coupled by the constant demand placed on his muscles by over one hundred pounds of adamantium  73  grants him some degree of superhuman strength  Since the presence of the adamantium negates the natural structural limits of his bones  he can lift or move weight that would otherwise damage a human skeleton  71  He has been depicted breaking steel chains  74  75  76  77  lifting several men above his head with one arm and throwing them through a wall 72  and lifting Ursa Major  in grizzly bear form  over his head before tossing him across a room  78  Wolverine s senses of sight  smell  and hearing are all superhumanly acute  He can see with perfect clarity at greater distances than an ordinary human  even in near total darkness  His hearing is enhanced in a similar manner  allowing him to both hear sounds ordinary humans cannot and also hear to greater distances  Wolverine is able to use his sense of smell to track targets by scent  even if the scent has been eroded somewhat over time by natural factors  This sense also allows him to identify shapeshifting mutants despite other forms they may take  79  He is also able to use his senses of smell and hearing  through concentration  as a type of natural lie detector  such as detecting a faint change in a person s heartbeat and scent due to perspiration when a lie is told  80  Due to a combination of his healing factor and high level psionic shields implanted by Professor Xavier  Wolverine s mind is highly resistant to telepathic assault and probing  81  Wolverine s mind also possesses what he refers to as  mental scar tissue  created by all of the traumatic events over the course of his life  It acts as a type of natural defense  even against a psychic as powerful as Emma Frost  82   edit  Skills and personality During his time in Japan and other countries  Wolverine becomes a master of virtually all forms of martial arts and is experienced in virtually every fighting style on Earth  He is proficient with most weaponry  including firearms  though he is partial to bladed weapons  He has demonstrated sufficient skills to defeat the likes of Shang Chi 83  and Captain America 84  in single combat  He also has a wide knowledge of the body and pressure points  85  He is also an accomplished pilot and highly skilled in the field of espionage and covert operations  citation needed  Wolverine will sometimes lapse into a  berserker rage  while in close combat  In this state he lashes out with the intensity and aggression of an enraged animal and is even more resistant to psionic attack  86  Though he loathes it  he acknowledges that it has saved his life many times  it being most notably useful when he faced the telepathic  Mister X   as X s ability to read his mind and predict his next move in a fight was useless in a berserk state as not even Wolverine knows what he will do next in this state  volume  amp  issue needed  Despite his apparent ease at taking lives  he does not enjoy killing or giving in to his berserker rages  Logan adheres to a firm code of personal honor and morality  87  In contrast to his brutish nature  Wolverine is extremely knowledgeable  Due to his increased lifespan  he has traveled around the world and amassed extensive knowledge of foreign languages and cultures  He is fluent in English  Japanese  Russian  Chinese  Cheyenne  Spanish  Arabic  and Lakota  he also has some knowledge of French  Filipino  Thai  Vietnamese  German  Italian  Portuguese  Korean  Hindi  and Persian  88  89  When Forge monitors Wolverine s vitals during a Danger Room training session  he calls Logan s physical and mental state  equivalent of an Olympic level gymnast performing a gold medal routine while simultaneously beating four chess computers in his head   79  Much to Professor Xavier s disapproval  Wolverine is also a heavy drinker and smoker   his healing powers negate the long term effects of alcohol and tobacco and allow him to indulge in prolonged binges  Wolverine is frequently depicted as a gruff loner  often taking leave from the X Men to deal with personal issues or problems  He is often irreverent and rebellious towards authority figures  though he is a reliable ally and capable leader  He has been a mentor and father figure to several younger women  especially Jubilee  Rogue  Kitty Pryde and X 23  and has had romantic relationships with numerous women  most notably Mariko Yashida 90    as well as a mutual  91  but unfulfilled attraction to Jean Grey  leading to jealous run ins with her boyfriend  and later husband   Scott Summers  He also married Viper as part of a debt  92  and then later divorced her  93  When Squirrel Girl is hired as a nanny for the daughter of Luke Cage and Jessica Jones  Wolverine reveals that he and Squirrel Girl had a relationship at some point in the past  and she uses his given name  James  indicating she knew him at some point when he was aware of his birth name  According to Wolverine  the relationship ended with the two agreeing never to see each other again  but Squirrel Girl stated she hopes they  can be professional  during her tenure as nanny  94   edit
