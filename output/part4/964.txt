King Arthur From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Statue of King Arthur  Hofkirche  Innsbruck  designed by Albrecht D rer and cast by Peter Vischer the Elder  1520s 1  King Arthur of Britain  by Howard Pyle from The Story of King Arthur and His Knights   1903   Arthur Pendragon  redirects here  For other uses  see Arthur Pendragon  disambiguation   For other uses  see King Arthur  disambiguation   King Arthur is a legendary British leader of the late 5th and early 6th centuries  who  according to Medieval histories and romances  led the defence of Britain against Saxon invaders in the early 6th century  The details of Arthur s story are mainly composed of folklore and literary invention  and his historical existence is debated and disputed by modern historians  2  The sparse historical background of Arthur is gleaned from various sources  including the Annales Cambriae  the Historia Brittonum  and the writings of Gildas  Arthur s name also occurs in early poetic sources such as Y Gododdin  3  The legendary Arthur developed as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth s fanciful and imaginative 12th century Historia Regum Britanniae  History of the Kings of Britain   4  Some Welsh and Breton tales and poems relating the story of Arthur date from earlier than this work  in these works  Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore  sometimes associated with the Welsh Otherworld  Annwn  5  How much of Geoffrey s Historia  completed in 1138  was adapted from such earlier sources  rather than invented by Geoffrey himself  is unknown  Although the themes  events and characters of the Arthurian legend varied widely from text to text  and there is no one canonical version  Geoffrey s version of events often served as the starting point for later stories  Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons and established an empire over Britain  Ireland  Iceland  Norway and Gaul  Many elements and incidents that are now an integral part of the Arthurian story appear in Geoffrey s Historia  including Arthur s father Uther Pendragon  the wizard Merlin  Arthur s wife Guinevere  the sword Excalibur  Arthur s conception at Tintagel  his final battle against Mordred at Camlann and final rest in Avalon  The 12th century French writer Chr tien de Troyes  who added Lancelot and the Holy Grail to the story  began the genre of Arthurian romance that became a significant strand of medieval literature  In these French stories  the narrative focus often shifts from King Arthur himself to other characters  such as various Knights of the Round Table  Arthurian literature thrived during the Middle Ages but waned in the centuries that followed until it experienced a major resurgence in the 19th century  In the 21st century  the legend lives on  not only in literature but also in adaptations for theatre  film  television  comics and other media  However  the Arthur depicted in films and television clearly is depicted as living during a much later period   the costumes used in such dramatizations resemble those of people living in the twelfth century more than they do those used during the fifth or sixth  Contents 1 Debated historicity 2 Name 3 Medieval literary

Nine Worthies  tapestry  c  1385 The historical basis for the King Arthur legend has long been debated by scholars  The first datable mention of King Arthur is in a 9th century Latin text  One school of thought  citing entries in the Historia Brittonum  History of the Britons  and Annales Cambriae  Welsh Annals   sees Arthur as a genuine historical figure  a Romano British leader who fought against the invading Anglo Saxons sometime in the late 5th to early 6th century  The Historia Brittonum  a 9th century Latin historical compilation attributed in some late manuscripts to a Welsh cleric called Nennius  lists twelve battles that Arthur fought  These culminate in the Battle of Mons Badonicus  or Mount Badon  where he is said to have single handedly killed 960 men  Recent studies  however  question the reliability of the Historia Brittonum as a source for the history of this period  6  The other text that seems to support the case for Arthur s historical existence is the 10th century Annales Cambriae  which also link Arthur with the Battle of Mount Badon  The Annales date this battle to 516 518  and also mention the Battle of Camlann  in which Arthur and Medraut  Mordred  were both killed  dated to 537 539  These details have often been used to bolster confidence in the Historia s account and to confirm that Arthur really did fight at Mount Badon  Problems have been identified  however  with using this source to support the Historia Brittonum s account  The latest research shows that the Annales Cambriae was based on a chronicle begun in the late 8th century in Wales  Additionally  the complex textual history of the Annales Cambriae precludes any certainty that the Arthurian annals were added to it even that early  They were more likely added at some point in the 10th century and may never have existed in any earlier set of annals  The Mount Badon entry probably derived from the Historia Brittonum  7  This lack of convincing early evidence is the reason many recent historians exclude Arthur from their accounts of sub Roman Britain  In the view of historian Thomas Charles Edwards   at this stage of the enquiry  one can only say that there may well have been an historical Arthur  but      the historian can as yet say nothing of value about him   8  These modern admissions of ignorance are a relatively recent trend  earlier generations of historians were less sceptical  Historian John Morris made the putative reign of Arthur the organising principle of his history of sub Roman Britain and Ireland  The Age of Arthur  1973   Even so  he found little to say about a historical Arthur  9  The 10th century Annales Cambriae  as copied into a manuscript of c  1100 Partly in reaction to such theories  another school of thought emerged which argued that Arthur had no historical existence at all  Morris s Age of Arthur prompted archaeologist Nowell Myres to observe that  no figure on the borderline of history and mythology has wasted more of the historian s time   10 Gildas  6th century polemic De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae  On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain   written within living memory of Mount Badon  mentions the battle but does not mention Arthur  11  Arthur is not mentioned in the Anglo Saxon Chronicle or named in any surviving manuscript written between 400 and 820  12  He is absent from Bede s early 8th century Ecclesiastical History of the English People  another major early source for post Roman history that mentions Mount Badon  13  Historian David Dumville has written   I think we can dispose of him  Arthur  quite briefly  He owes his place in our history books to a  no smoke without fire  school of thought     The fact of the matter is that there is no historical evidence about Arthur  we must reject him from our histories and  above all  from the titles of our books   14  Some scholars argue that Arthur was originally a fictional hero of folklore or even a half forgotten Celtic deity who became credited with real deeds in the distant past  They cite parallels with figures such as the Kentish totemic horse gods Hengest and Horsa  who later became historicised  Bede ascribed to these legendary figures a historical role in the 5th century Anglo Saxon conquest of eastern Britain  15  It is not even certain that Arthur was considered a king in the early texts  Neither the Historia nor the Annales calls him  rex   the former calls him instead  dux bellorum   leader of battles  and  miles   soldier   16  Historical documents for the post Roman period are scarce  so a definitive answer to the question of Arthur s historical existence is unlikely  Sites and places have been identified as  Arthurian  since the 12th century  17  but archaeology can confidently reveal names only through inscriptions found in secure contexts  The so called  Arthur stone   discovered in 1998 among the ruins at Tintagel Castle in Cornwall in securely dated 6th century contexts  created a brief stir but proved irrelevant  18  Other inscriptional evidence for Arthur  including the Glastonbury cross  is tainted with the suggestion of forgery  19  Although several historical figures have been proposed as the basis for Arthur  20  no convincing evidence for these identifications has emerged  Name Main article  Arthur The origin of the name Arthur remains a matter of debate  Some suggest it is derived from the Roman nomen gentile  family name  Art rius  of obscure and contested etymology 21   but possibly of Messapic 22  23  24  or Etruscan origin 25  26  27    Some scholars have suggested it is relevant to this debate that the legendary King Arthur s name only appears as Arthur  or Arturus  in early Latin Arthurian texts  never as Art rius  though it should be noted that Classical Latin Art rius became Arturius in some Vulgar Latin dialects   However  this may not say anything about the origin of the name Arthur  as Art rius would regularly become Art h ur when borrowed into Welsh  28  Another possibility is that it is derived from a Brittonic patronym  Arto r g ios  the root of which   arto r g   bear king  is to be found in the Old Irish personal name Art ri  via a Latinized form Art rius  29  Less likely is the commonly proposed derivation from Welsh arth  bear     g wr  man   earlier  Arto uiros in Brittonic   there are phonological difficulties with this theory notably that a Brittonic compound name  Arto uiros should produce Old Welsh  Artgur and Middle Modern Welsh  Arthwr and not Arthur  in Welsh poetry the name is always spelled Arthur and is exclusively rhymed with words ending in  ur   never words ending in  wr   which confirms that the second element cannot be  g wr  man    30  31  An alternative theory  which has gained only limited acceptance among professional scholars  32  derives the name Arthur from Arcturus  the brightest star in the constellation Bo tes  near Ursa Major or the Great Bear  Classical Latin Arcturus would also have become Art h ur when borrowed into Welsh  and its brightness and position in the sky led people to regard it as the  guardian of the bear   which is the meaning of the name in Ancient Greek  and the  leader  of the other stars in Bo tes  33  A similar first name is Old Irish Art r  which is believed to be derived directly from an early Old Welsh or Cumbric Artur  34  The earliest historically attested bearer of the name is a son or grandson of  ed n mac Gabr in  d  AD 609   35  Medieval literary traditions The creator of the familiar literary persona of Arthur was Geoffrey of Monmouth  with his pseudo historical Historia Regum Britanniae  History of the Kings of Britain   written in the 1130s  The textual sources for Arthur are usually divided into those written before Geoffrey s Historia  known as pre Galfridian texts  from the Latin form of Geoffrey  Galfridus  and those written afterwards  which could not avoid his influence  Galfridian  or post Galfridian  texts   Pre Galfridian traditions A facsimile page of Y Gododdin  one of the most famous early Welsh texts featuring Arthur  c  1275 The earliest literary references to Arthur come from Welsh and Breton sources  There have been few attempts to define the nature and character of Arthur in the pre Galfridian tradition as a whole  rather than in a single text or text story type  One recent academic survey that does attempt this  by Thomas Green  identifies three key strands to the portrayal of Arthur in this earliest material  36  The first is that he was a peerless warrior who functioned as the monster hunting protector of Britain from all internal and external threats  Some of these are human threats  such as the Saxons he fights in the Historia Brittonum  but the majority are supernatural  including giant cat monsters  destructive divine boars  dragons  dogheads  giants and witches  37  The second is that the pre Galfridian Arthur was a figure of folklore  particularly topographic or onomastic folklore  and localised magical wonder tales  the leader of a band of superhuman heroes who live in the wilds of the landscape  38  The third and final strand is that the early Welsh Arthur had a close connection with the Welsh Otherworld  Annwn  On the one hand  he launches assaults on Otherworldly fortresses in search of treasure and frees their prisoners  On the other  his warband in the earliest sources includes former pagan gods  and his wife and his possessions are clearly Otherworldly in origin  39  One of the most famous Welsh poetic references to Arthur comes in the collection of heroic death songs known as Y Gododdin  The Gododdin   attributed to the 6th century poet Aneirin  In one stanza  the bravery of a warrior who slew 300 enemies is praised  but it is then noted that despite this  he was no Arthur   that is to say his feats cannot compare to the valour of Arthur  40 Y Gododdin is known only from a 13th century manuscript  so it is impossible to determine whether this passage is original or a later interpolation  but John Koch s view that the passage dates from a 7th century or earlier version is regarded as unproven  9th  or 10th century dates are often proposed for it  41  Several poems attributed to Taliesin  a poet said to have lived in the 6th century  also refer to Arthur  although these all probably date from between the 8th and 12th centuries  42  They include  Kadeir Teyrnon    The Chair of the Prince    43  which refers to  Arthur the Blessed    Preiddeu Annwn    The Spoils of Annwn    44  which recounts an expedition of Arthur to the Otherworld  and  Marwnat vthyr pen dragon     The Elegy of Uther Pen dragon     45  which refers to Arthur s valour and is suggestive of a father son relationship for Arthur and Uther that pre dates Geoffrey of Monmouth  Culhwch entering Arthur s Court in the Welsh tale Culhwch and Olwen  1881 Other early Welsh Arthurian texts include a poem found in the Black Book of Carmarthen   Pa gur yv y porthaur     What man is the gatekeeper     46  This takes the form of a dialogue between Arthur and the gatekeeper of a fortress he wishes to enter  in which Arthur recounts the names and deeds of himself and his men  notably Cei  Kay  and Bedwyr  Bedivere   The Welsh prose tale Culhwch and Olwen  c  1100   included in the modern Mabinogion collection  has a much longer list of more than 200 of Arthur s men  though Cei and Bedwyr again take a central place  The story as a whole tells of Arthur helping his kinsman Culhwch win the hand of Olwen  daughter of Ysbaddaden Chief Giant  by completing a series of apparently impossible tasks  including the hunt for the great semi divine boar Twrch Trwyth  The 9th century Historia Brittonum also refers to this tale  with the boar there named Troy n t  47  Finally  Arthur is mentioned numerous times in the Welsh Triads  a collection of short summaries of Welsh tradition and legend which are classified into groups of three linked characters or episodes in order to assist recall  The later manuscripts of the Triads are partly derivative from Geoffrey of Monmouth and later continental traditions  but the earliest ones show no such influence and are usually agreed to refer to pre existing Welsh traditions  Even in these  however  Arthur s court has started to embody legendary Britain as a whole  with  Arthur s Court  sometimes substituted for  The Island of Britain  in the formula  Three XXX of the Island of Britain   48  While it is not clear from the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae that Arthur was even considered a king  by the time Culhwch and Olwen and the Triads were written he had become Penteyrnedd yr Ynys hon   Chief of the Lords of this Island   the overlord of Wales  Cornwall and the North  49  In addition to these pre Galfridian Welsh poems and tales  Arthur appears in some other early Latin texts besides the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae  In particular  Arthur features in a number of well known vitae   Lives   of post Roman saints  none of which are now generally considered to be reliable historical sources  the earliest probably dates from the 11th century   50  According to the Life of Saint Gildas  written in the early 12th century by Caradoc of Llancarfan  Arthur is said to have killed Gildas  brother Hueil and to have rescued his wife Gwenhwyfar from Glastonbury  51  In the Life of Saint Cadoc  written around 1100 or a little before by Lifris of Llancarfan  the saint gives protection to a man who killed three of Arthur s soldiers  and Arthur demands a herd of cattle as wergeld for his men  Cadoc delivers them as demanded  but when Arthur takes possession of the animals  they turn into bundles of ferns  52  Similar incidents are described in the medieval biographies of Carannog  Padarn and Eufflam  probably written around the 12th century  A less obviously legendary account of Arthur appears in the Legenda Sancti Goeznovii  which is often claimed to date from the early 11th century although the earliest manuscript of this text dates from the 15th century  53  Also important are the references to Arthur in William of Malmesbury s De Gestis Regum Anglorum and Herman s De Miraculis Sanctae Mariae Laudensis  which together provide the first certain evidence for a belief that Arthur was not actually dead and would at some point return  a theme that is often revisited in post Galfridian folklore  54  Geoffrey of Monmouth Mordred  Arthur s final foe according to Geoffrey of Monmouth  illustrated by H  J  Ford for Andrew Lang s King Arthur  The Tales of the Round Table  1902 The first narrative account of Arthur s life is found in Geoffrey of Monmouth s Latin work Historia Regum Britanniae  History of the Kings of Britain   55  This work  completed c  1138  is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th century Welsh king Cadwallader  Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post Roman period as do Historia Brittonum and Annales Cambriae  He incorporates Arthur s father  Uther Pendragon  his magician advisor Merlin  and the story of Arthur s conception  in which Uther  disguised as his enemy Gorlois by Merlin s magic  sleeps with Gorlois s wife Igerna at Tintagel  and she conceives Arthur  On Uther s death  the fifteen year old Arthur succeeds him as King of Britain and fights a series of battles  similar to those in the Historia Brittonum  culminating in the Battle of Bath  He then defeats the Picts and Scots before creating an Arthurian empire through his conquests of Ireland  Iceland and the Orkney Islands  After twelve years of peace  Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more  taking control of Norway  Denmark and Gaul  Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered  and Arthur s victory naturally leads to a further confrontation between his empire and Rome s  Arthur and his warriors  including Kaius  Kay   Beduerus  Bedivere  and Gualguanus  Gawain   defeat the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius in Gaul but  as he prepares to march on Rome  Arthur hears that his nephew Modredus  Mordred  whom he had left in charge of Britain has married his wife Guenhuuara  Guinevere  and seized the throne  Arthur returns to Britain and defeats and kills Modredus on the river Camblam in Cornwall  but he is mortally wounded  He hands the crown to his kinsman Constantine and is taken to the isle of Avalon to be healed of his wounds  never to be seen again  56  Merlin the wizard  c  1300 57  How much of this narrative was Geoffrey s own invention is open to debate  Certainly  Geoffrey seems to have made use of the list of Arthur s twelve battles against the Saxons found in the 9th century Historia Brittonum  along with the battle of Camlann from the Annales Cambriae and the idea that Arthur was still alive  58  Arthur s personal status as the king of all Britain would also seem to be borrowed from pre Galfridian tradition  being found in Culhwch and Olwen  the Triads and the Saints  Lives  59  In addition  many of the elements that Monmouth s King Arthur includes are strong parallels to  Culhwch and Olwen   The motifs and themes of loyalty  honor  giants  gift giving  wife stealing  and magical creatures are prominent in both stories  Furthermore  Monmouth derived many of his character s names from  Culhwch and Olwen   Sir Kay comes from  Kai   Sir Bedivere is derived from  Bedwyr   and lastly Sir Gawain is  Gwalchmei  in Welsh  Also  the heroines of both tales have similar names  the meaning of Guinever is  White Phantom   while Olwen equates with  of the white track   60  Finally  Geoffrey borrowed many of the names for Arthur s possessions  close family and companions from the pre Galfridian Welsh tradition  including Kaius  Cei   Beduerus  Bedwyr   Guenhuuara  Gwenhwyfar   Uther  Uthyr  and perhaps also Caliburnus  Caledfwlch   the latter becoming Excalibur in subsequent Arthurian tales  61  However  while names  key events and titles may have been borrowed  Brynley Roberts has argued that  the Arthurian section is Geoffrey s literary creation and it owes nothing to prior narrative   62  So  for instance  the Welsh Medraut is made the villainous Modredus by Geoffrey  but there is no trace of such a negative character for this figure in Welsh sources until the 16th century  63  There have been relatively few modern attempts to challenge this notion that the Historia Regum Britanniae is primarily Geoffrey s own work  with scholarly opinion often echoing William of Newburgh s late 12th century comment that Geoffrey  made up  his narrative  perhaps through an  inordinate love of lying   64 Geoffrey Ashe is one dissenter from this view  believing that Geoffrey s narrative is partially derived from a lost source telling of the deeds of a 5th century British king named Riotamus  this figure being the original Arthur  although historians and Celticists have been reluctant to follow Ashe in his conclusions  65  Whatever his sources may have been  the immense popularity of Geoffrey s Historia Regum Britanniae cannot be denied  Well over 200 manuscript copies of Geoffrey s Latin work are known to have survived  and this does not include translations into other languages  66  Thus  for example  around 60 manuscripts are extant containing Welsh language versions of the Historia  the earliest of which were created in the 13th century  the old notion that some of these Welsh versions actually underlie Geoffrey s Historia  advanced by antiquarians such as the 18th century Lewis Morris  has long since been discounted in academic circles  67  As a result of this popularity  Geoffrey s Historia Regum Britanniae was enormously influential on the later medieval development of the Arthurian legend  While it was by no means the only creative force behind Arthurian romance  many of its elements were borrowed and developed  e g   Merlin and the final fate of Arthur   and it provided the historical framework into which the romancers  tales of magical and wonderful adventures were inserted  68  Romance traditions During the 12th century  Arthur s character began to be marginalised by the accretion of  Arthurian  side stories such as that of Tristan and Iseult  John William Waterhouse  1916 The popularity of Geoffrey s Historia and its other derivative works  such as Wace s Roman de Brut  is generally agreed to be an important factor in explaining the appearance of significant numbers of new Arthurian works in continental Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries  particularly in France  69  It was not  however  the only Arthurian influence on the developing  Matter of Britain   There is clear evidence for a knowledge of Arthur and Arthurian tales on the Continent before Geoffrey s work became widely known  see for example  the Modena Archivolt   70  as well as for the use of  Celtic  names and stories not found in Geoffrey s Historia in the Arthurian romances  71  From the perspective of Arthur  perhaps the most significant effect of this great outpouring of new Arthurian story was on the role of the king himself  much of this 12th century and later Arthurian literature centres less on Arthur himself than on characters such as Lancelot and Guenevere  Perceval  Galahad  Gawain  and Tristan and Isolde  Whereas Arthur is very much at the centre of the pre Galfridian material and Geoffrey s Historia itself  in the romances he is rapidly sidelined  72  His character also alters significantly  In both the earliest materials and Geoffrey he is a great and ferocious warrior  who laughs as he personally slaughters witches and giants and takes a leading role in all military campaigns  73  whereas in the continental romances he becomes the roi fain ant  the  do nothing king   whose  inactivity and acquiescence constituted a central flaw in his otherwise ideal society   74  Arthur s role in these works is frequently that of a wise  dignified  even tempered  somewhat bland  and occasionally feeble monarch  So  he simply turns pale and silent when he learns of Lancelot s affair with Guinevere in the Mort Artu  whilst in Chr tien de Troyes s Yvain  the Knight of the Lion he is unable to stay awake after a feast and has to retire for a nap  75  Nonetheless  as Norris J  Lacy has observed  whatever his faults and frailties may be in these Arthurian romances   his prestige is never or almost never compromised by his personal weaknesses     his authority and glory remain intact   76  Arthur  top centre  in an illustration to the Middle English poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight  late 14th century Arthur and his retinue appear in some of the Lais of Marie de France  77  but it was the work of another French poet  Chr tien de Troyes  that had the greatest influence with regard to the above development of the character of Arthur and his legend  78  Chr tien wrote five Arthurian romances between c  1170 and c  1190  Erec and Enide and Clig s are tales of courtly love with Arthur s court as their backdrop  demonstrating the shift away from the heroic world of the Welsh and Galfridian Arthur  while Yvain  the Knight of the Lion features Yvain and Gawain in a supernatural adventure  with Arthur very much on the sidelines and weakened  However  the most significant for the development of the Arthurian legend are Lancelot  the Knight of the Cart  which introduces Lancelot and his adulterous relationship with Arthur s queen  Guinevere   extending and popularizing the recurring theme of Arthur as a cuckold  and Perceval  the Story of the Grail  which introduces the Holy Grail and the Fisher King and which again sees Arthur having a much reduced role  79  Chr tien was thus  instrumental both in the elaboration of the Arthurian legend and in the establishment of the ideal form for the diffusion of that legend   80  and much of what came after him in terms of the portrayal of Arthur and his world built upon the foundations he had laid  Perceval  although unfinished  was particularly popular  four separate continuations of the poem appeared over the next half century  with the notion of the Grail and its quest being developed by other writers such as Robert de Boron  a fact that helped accelerate the decline of Arthur in continental romance  81  Similarly  Lancelot and his cuckolding of Arthur with Guinevere became one of the classic motifs of the Arthurian legend  although the Lancelot of the prose Lancelot  c  1225  and later texts was a combination of Chr tien s character and that of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven s Lanzelet  82  Chr tien s work even appears to feed back into Welsh Arthurian literature  with the result that the romance Arthur began to replace the heroic  active Arthur in Welsh literary tradition  83  Particularly significant in this development were the three Welsh Arthurian romances  which are closely similar to those of Chr tien  albeit with some significant differences  Owain  or the Lady of the Fountain is related to Chr tien s Yvain  Geraint and Enid  to Erec and Enide  and Peredur son of Efrawg  to Perceval  84  The Round Table experience a vision of the Holy Grail  From a 15th century French manuscript  Up to c  1210  continental Arthurian romance was expressed primarily through poetry  after this date the tales began to be told in prose  The most significant of these 13th century prose romances was the Vulgate Cycle  also known as the Lancelot Grail Cycle   a series of five Middle French prose works written in the first half of that century  85  These works were the Estoire del Saint Grail  the Estoire de Merlin  the Lancelot propre  or Prose Lancelot  which made up half the entire Vulgate Cycle on its own   the Queste del Saint Graal and the Mort Artu  which combine to form the first coherent version of the entire Arthurian legend  The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend  partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin  It also made Mordred the result of an incestuous relationship between Arthur and his sister and established the role of Camelot  first mentioned in passing in Chr tien s Lancelot  as Arthur s primary court  86  This series of texts was quickly followed by the Post Vulgate Cycle  c  1230 40   of which the Suite du Merlin is a part  which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot s affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur  now in order to focus more on the Grail quest  85  As such  Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances  in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the Estoire de Merlin and the Mort Artu  The development of the medieval Arthurian cycle and the character of the  Arthur of romance  culminated in Le Morte d Arthur  Thomas Malory s retelling of the entire legend in a single work in English in the late 15th century  Malory based his book originally titled The Whole Book of King Arthur and of His Noble Knights of the Round Table on the various previous romance versions  in particular the Vulgate Cycle  and appears to have aimed at creating a comprehensive and authoritative collection of Arthurian stories  87  Perhaps as a result of this  and the fact that Le Morte D Arthur was one of the earliest printed books in England  published by William Caxton in 1485  most later Arthurian works are derivative of Malory s  88  Decline  revival  and the modern legend Post medieval literature The end of the Middle Ages brought with it a waning of interest in King Arthur  Although Malory s English version of the great French romances was popular  there were increasing attacks upon the truthfulness of the historical framework of the Arthurian romances established since Geoffrey of Monmouth s time and thus the legitimacy of the whole Matter of Britain  So  for example  the 16th century humanist scholar Polydore Vergil famously rejected the claim that Arthur was the ruler of a post Roman empire  found throughout the post Galfridian medieval  chronicle tradition   to the horror of Welsh and English antiquarians  89  Social changes associated with the end of the medieval period and the Renaissance also conspired to rob the character of Arthur and his associated legend of some of their power to enthral audiences  with the result that 1634 saw the last printing of Malory s Le Morte d Arthur for nearly 200 years  90  King Arthur and the Arthurian legend were not entirely abandoned  but until the early 19th century the material was taken less seriously and was often used simply as vehicle for allegories of 17th  and 18th century politics  91  Thus Richard Blackmore s epics Prince Arthur  1695  and King Arthur  1697  feature Arthur as an allegory for the struggles of William III against James II  92  Similarly  the most popular Arthurian tale throughout this period seems to have been that of Tom Thumb  which was told first through chapbooks and later through the political plays of Henry Fielding  although the action is clearly set in Arthurian Britain  the treatment is humorous and Arthur appears as a primarily comedic version of his romance character  93  John Dryden s masque King Arthur is still performed  largely thanks to Henry Purcell s music  though seldom unabridged  Tennyson and the revival Gustave Dor  s illustration of Arthur and Merlin for Alfred  Lord Tennyson s Idylls of the King  1868 In the early 19th century  medievalism  Romanticism  and the Gothic Revival reawakened interest in Arthur and the medieval romances  A new code of ethics for 19th century gentlemen was shaped around the chivalric ideals that the  Arthur of romance  embodied  This renewed interest first made itself felt in 1816  when Malory s Le Morte d Arthur was reprinted for the first time since 1634  94  Initially the medieval Arthurian legends were of particular interest to poets  inspiring  for example  William Wordsworth to write  The Egyptian Maid   1835   an allegory of the Holy Grail  95  Pre eminent among these was Alfred Lord Tennyson  whose first Arthurian poem   The Lady of Shalott   was published in 1832  96  Although Arthur himself played a minor role in some of these works  following in the medieval romance tradition  Tennyson s Arthurian work reached its peak of popularity with Idylls of the King  which reworked the entire narrative of Arthur s life for the Victorian era  First published in 1859  it sold 10 000 copies within the first week  97  In the Idylls  Arthur became a symbol of ideal manhood whose attempt to establish a perfect kingdom on earth fails  finally  through human weakness  98  Tennyson s works prompted a large number of imitators  generated considerable public interest in the legends of Arthur and the character himself  and brought Malory s tales to a wider audience  99  Indeed  the first modernization of Malory s great compilation of Arthur s tales was published shortly after Idylls appeared  in 1862  and there were six further editions and five competitors before the century ended  100  This interest in the  Arthur of romance  and his associated stories continued through the 19th century and into the 20th  and influenced poets such as William Morris and Pre Raphaelite artists including Edward Burne Jones  101  Even the humorous tale of Tom Thumb  which had been the primary manifestation of Arthur s legend in the 18th century  was rewritten after the publication of Idylls  While Tom maintained his small stature and remained a figure of comic relief  his story now included more elements from the medieval Arthurian romances  and Arthur is treated more seriously and historically in these new versions  102  The revived Arthurian romance also proved influential in the United States  with such books as Sidney Lanier s The Boy s King Arthur  1880  reaching wide audiences and providing inspiration for Mark Twain s satiric A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur s Court  1889   103  Although the  Arthur of romance  was sometimes central to these new Arthurian works  as he was in Burne Jones s The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon  1881 1898   on other occasions he reverted back to his medieval status and is either marginalised or even missing entirely  with Wagner s Arthurian operas providing a notable instance of the latter  104  Furthermore  the revival of interest in Arthur and the Arthurian tales did not continue unabated  By the end of the 19th century  it was confined mainly to Pre Raphaelite imitators  105  and it could not avoid being affected by the First World War  which damaged the reputation of chivalry and thus interest in its medieval manifestations and Arthur as chivalric role model  106  The romance tradition did  however  remain sufficiently powerful to persuade Thomas Hardy  Laurence Binyon and John Masefield to compose Arthurian plays  107  and T  S  Eliot alludes to the Arthur myth  but not Arthur  in his poem The Waste Land  which mentions the Fisher King  108  Modern legend How Arthur drew forth ye sword  by Howard Pyle  The sword in the anvil or sword in the stone chapter of The Story of King Arthur and His Knights   1903  See also  King Arthur in various media In the latter half of the 20th century  the influence of the romance tradition of Arthur continued  through novels such as T  H  White s The Once and Future King  1958  and Marion Zimmer Bradley s The Mists of Avalon  1982  in addition to comic strips such as Prince Valiant  from 1937 onward   109  Tennyson had reworked the romance tales of Arthur to suit and comment upon the issues of his day  and the same is often the case with modern treatments too  Bradley s tale  for example  takes a feminist approach to Arthur and his legend  in contrast to the narratives of Arthur found in medieval materials  110  and American authors often rework the story of Arthur to be more consistent with values such as equality and democracy  111  The romance Arthur has become popular in film and theatre as well  T  H  White s novel was adapted into the Lerner Loewe stage musical Camelot  1960  and the Disney animated film The Sword in the Stone  1963   Camelot  with its focus on the love of Lancelot and Guinevere and the cuckolding of Arthur  was itself made into a film of the same name in 1967  The romance tradition of Arthur is particularly evident and  according to critics  successfully handled in Robert Bresson s Lancelot du Lac  1974   Eric Rohmer s Perceval le Gallois  1978  and perhaps John Boorman s fantasy film Excalibur  1981   it is also the main source of the material utilised in the Arthurian spoof Monty Python and the Holy Grail  1975   112  The combat of Arthur and Mordred  illustrated by N C  Wyeth for The Boy s King Arthur  1922 Re tellings and re imaginings of the romance tradition are not the only important aspect of the modern legend of King Arthur  Attempts to portray Arthur as a genuine historical figure of c  500 AD  stripping away the  romance   have also emerged  As Taylor and Brewer have noted  this return to the medieval  chronicle tradition   of Geoffrey of Monmouth and the Historia Brittonum is a recent trend which became dominant in Arthurian literature in the years following the outbreak of the Second World War  when Arthur s legendary resistance to Germanic invaders struck a chord in Britain  113 Clemence Dane s series of radio plays  The Saviours  1942   used a historical Arthur to embody the spirit of heroic resistance against desperate odds  and Robert Sherriff s play The Long Sunset  1955  saw Arthur rallying Romano British resistance against the Germanic invaders  114  This trend towards placing Arthur in a historical setting is also apparent in historical and fantasy novels published during this period  115  In recent years the portrayal of Arthur as a real hero of the 5th century has also made its way into film versions of the Arthurian legend  most notably the TV series Arthur of the Britons 116  and the feature films King Arthur  2004  and The Last Legion  2007   117  The 2008 BBC series Merlin is a reimagining of the legend in which the future King Arthur and Merlin are young contemporaries  Camelot  2011   118  is an exclusive short series of episodes which depict Arthur in ancient Briton and his struggle for the throne  Also  a recent Disney film  Avalon High has been released  the story about a modern day King Arthur and his knights of the round table  Legacy as a role model During the Middle Ages  Arthur was made a member of the Nine Worthies  a group of heroes encapsulating all the ideal qualities of chivalry  His life was thus proposed as a valuable subject for study by those aspiring to chivalric status  This aspect of Arthur in the Nine Worthies was popularised firstly through literature and was thereafter adopted as a frequent subject by painters and sculptors  Arthur has also been used as a model for modern day behaviour  In the 1930s  the Order of the Fellowship of the Knights of the Round Table was formed in Britain to promote Christian ideals and Arthurian notions of medieval chivalry  119  In the United States  hundreds of thousands of boys and girls joined Arthurian youth groups  such as the Knights of King Arthur  in which Arthur and his legends were promoted as wholesome exemplars  120  Legacy in popular culture Arthur s diffusion within contemporary culture goes beyond obviously Arthurian endeavours  with Arthurian names being regularly attached to objects  buildings and places  As Norris J  Lacy has observed   The popular notion of Arthur appears to be limited  not surprisingly  to a few motifs and names  but there can be no doubt of the extent to which a legend born many centuries ago is profoundly embedded in modern culture at every level   121  See also Historical basis for
