transmitted infection disease Acquired immune deficiency syndrome or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome  AIDS  is a disease of the human immune system caused by the human immunodeficiency virus  HIV   1  2  3  The illness interferes with the immune system  making people with AIDS much more likely to get infections  including opportunistic infections and tumors that do not affect people with working immune systems  This susceptibility gets worse as the disease continues  HIV is transmitted in many ways  such as  vaginal  oral or anal sex  blood transfusion  contaminated hypodermic needles  and exchange between mother and baby during pregnancy  childbirth  and breastfeeding  It can be transmitted by any contact of a mucous membrane or the bloodstream with a bodily fluid that has the virus in it  such as the blood  semen  vaginal fluid  preseminal fluid  or breast milk from an infected person  4  5  The virus and disease are often referred to together as HIV AIDS  The disease is a major health problem in many parts of the world  and is considered a pandemic  a disease outbreak that is not only present over a large area but is actively spreading  6  In 2009  the World Health Organization  WHO  estimated that there are 33 4 million people worldwide living with HIV AIDS  with 2 7 million new HIV infections per year and 2 0 million annual deaths due to AIDS  7  In 2007  UNAIDS estimated  33 2 million people worldwide were HIV positive  AIDS killed 2 1 million people in the course of that year  including 330 000 children  and 76  of those deaths occurred in sub Saharan Africa  8  According to UNAIDS 2009 report  worldwide some 60 million people have been infected since the start of the pandemic  with some 25 million deaths  and 14 million orphaned children in southern Africa alone  9  Genetic research indicates that HIV originated in west central Africa during the late nineteenth or early twentieth century  10  11  AIDS was first recognized by the U  S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1981 and its cause  HIV  identified in the early 1980s  12  Although treatments for HIV AIDS can slow the course of the disease  there is no known cure or HIV vaccine  Antiretroviral treatment reduces both the deaths and new infections from HIV AIDS  but these drugs are expensive and the medications are not available in all countries  13  Due to the difficulty in treating HIV infection  preventing infection is a key aim in controlling the AIDS pandemic  with health organizations promoting safe sex and needle exchange programmes in attempts to slow the spread of the virus  Contents 1 Signs and symptoms 1 1 Pulmonary 1 2 Gastrointestinal 1 3 Neurological and psychiatric 1 4 Tumors 1 5 Other infections 2 Cause 2 1 Sexual transmission 2 2

lungs on both sides  characteristic of PCP  The symptoms of AIDS are primarily the result of conditions that do not normally develop in individuals with healthy immune systems  Most of these conditions are opportunistic infections caused by bacteria  viruses  fungi and parasites that are normally controlled by the elements of the immune system that HIV damages  14  These infections affect nearly every organ system  People with AIDS also have an increased risk of developing various cancers such as Kaposi s sarcoma  cervical cancer and cancers of the immune system known as lymphomas  Additionally  people with AIDS often have systemic symptoms of infection like fevers  sweats  particularly at night   swollen glands  chills  weakness  and weight loss  15  16  The specific opportunistic infections that AIDS patients develop depend in part on the prevalence of these infections in the geographic area in which the patient lives  Pulmonary Pneumocystis pneumonia  originally known as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia  and still abbreviated as PCP  which now stands for Pneumocystis pneumonia  is relatively rare in healthy  immunocompetent people  but common among HIV infected individuals  It is caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii  Before the advent of effective diagnosis  treatment and routine prophylaxis in Western countries  it was a common immediate cause of death  In developing countries  it is still one of the first indications of AIDS in untested individuals  although it does not generally occur unless the CD4 count is less than 200 cells per  L of blood  17  Tuberculosis  TB  is unique among infections associated with HIV because it is transmissible to immunocompetent people via the respiratory route  and is not easily treatable once identified  18 Multidrug resistance is a serious problem  Tuberculosis with HIV co infection  TB HIV  is a major world health problem according to the World Health Organization  in 2007  456 000 deaths among incident TB cases were HIV positive  a third of all TB deaths and nearly a quarter of the estimated 2 million HIV deaths in that year  19  Even though its incidence has declined because of the use of directly observed therapy and other improved practices in Western countries  this is not the case in developing countries where HIV is most prevalent  In early stage HIV infection  CD4 count  gt 300 cells per  L   TB typically presents as a pulmonary disease  In advanced HIV infection  TB often presents atypically with extrapulmonary  systemic  disease a common feature  Symptoms are usually constitutional and are not localized to one particular site  often affecting bone marrow  bone  urinary and gastrointestinal tracts  liver  regional lymph nodes  and the central nervous system  20  Gastrointestinal Esophagitis is an inflammation of the lining of the lower end of the esophagus  gullet or swallowing tube leading to the stomach   In HIV infected individuals  this is normally due to fungal  candidiasis  or viral  herpes simplex 1 or cytomegalovirus  infections  In rare cases  it could be due to mycobacteria  21  Unexplained chronic diarrhea in HIV infection is due to many possible causes  including common bacterial  Salmonella  Shigella  Listeria or Campylobacter  and parasitic infections  and uncommon opportunistic infections such as cryptosporidiosis  microsporidiosis  Mycobacterium avium complex  MAC  and viruses  22 astrovirus  adenovirus  rotavirus and cytomegalovirus   the latter as a course of colitis   In some cases  diarrhea may be a side effect of several drugs used to treat HIV  or it may simply accompany HIV infection  particularly during primary HIV infection  It may also be a side effect of antibiotics used to treat bacterial causes of diarrhea  common for Clostridium difficile   In the later stages of HIV infection  diarrhea is thought to be a reflection of changes in the way the intestinal tract absorbs nutrients  and may be an important component of HIV related wasting  23  Neurological and psychiatric HIV infection may lead to a variety of neuropsychiatric sequelae  either by infection of the now susceptible nervous system by organisms  or as a direct consequence of the illness itself  24  Toxoplasmosis is a disease caused by the single celled parasite called Toxoplasma gondii  it usually infects the brain  causing toxoplasma encephalitis  but it can also infect and cause disease in the eyes and lungs  25  Cryptococcal meningitis is an infection of the meninx  the membrane covering the brain and spinal cord  by the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans  It can cause fevers  headache  fatigue  nausea  and vomiting  Patients may also develop seizures and confusion  left untreated  it can be lethal  Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  PML  is a demyelinating disease  in which the gradual destruction of the myelin sheath covering the axons of nerve cells impairs the transmission of nerve impulses  It is caused by a virus called JC virus which occurs in 70  of the population in latent form  causing disease only when the immune system has been severely weakened  as is the case for AIDS patients  It progresses rapidly  usually causing death within months of diagnosis  26  AIDS dementia complex  ADC  is a metabolic encephalopathy induced by HIV infection and fueled by immune activation of HIV infected brain macrophages and microglia  These cells are productively infected by HIV and secrete neurotoxins of both host and viral origin  27  Specific neurological impairments are manifested by cognitive  behavioral  and motor abnormalities that occur after years of HIV infection and are associated with low CD4  T cell levels and high plasma viral loads  Prevalence is 10 20  in Western countries 28  but only 1 2  of HIV infections in India  29  30  This difference is possibly due to the HIV subtype in India  AIDS related mania is sometimes seen in patients with advanced HIV illness  it presents with more irritability and cognitive impairment and less euphoria than a manic episode associated with true bipolar disorder  Unlike the latter condition  it may have a more chronic course  This syndrome is less frequently seen with the advent of multi drug therapy  Tumors Kaposi s sarcoma Patients with HIV infection have substantially increased incidence of several cancers  This is primarily due to co infection with an oncogenic DNA virus  especially Epstein Barr virus  EBV   Kaposi s sarcoma associated herpesvirus  KSHV   also known as human herpesvirus 8  HHV 8    and human papillomavirus  HPV   31  32  Kaposi s sarcoma  KS  is the most common tumor in HIV infected patients  The appearance of this tumor in young homosexual men in 1981 was one of the first signals of the AIDS epidemic  Caused by a gammaherpes virus called Kaposi s sarcoma associated herpes virus  KSHV   it often appears as purplish nodules on the skin  but can affect other organs  especially the mouth  gastrointestinal tract  and lungs  High grade B cell lymphomas such as Burkitt s lymphoma  Burkitt s like lymphoma  diffuse large B cell lymphoma  DLBCL   and primary central nervous system lymphoma present more often in HIV infected patients  These particular cancers often foreshadow a poor prognosis  Epstein Barr virus  EBV  or KSHV cause many of these lymphomas  In HIV infected patients  lymphoma often arises in extranodal sites such as the gastrointestinal tract  33  When they occur in an HIV infected patient  KS and aggressive B cell lymphomas confer a diagnosis of AIDS  Invasive cervical cancer in HIV infected women is also considered AIDS defining  it is caused by human papillomavirus  HPV   34  In addition to the AIDS defining tumors listed above  HIV infected patients are at increased risk of certain other tumors  notably Hodgkin s disease  anal and rectal carcinomas  hepatocellular carcinomas  head and neck cancers  and lung cancer  Some of these are causes by viruses  such as Hodgkin s disease  EBV   anal rectal cancers  HPV   head and neck cancers  HPV   and hepatocellular carcinoma  hepatitis B or C   Other contributing factors include exposure to carcinogens  cigarette smoke for lung cancer   or living for years with subtle immune defects  Interestingly  the incidence of many common tumors  such as breast cancer or colon cancer  does not increase in HIV infected patients  In areas where HAART is extensively used to treat AIDS  the incidence of many AIDS related malignancies has decreased  but at the same time malignant cancers overall have become the most common cause of death of HIV infected patients  35  In recent years  an increasing proportion of these deaths have been from non AIDS defining cancers  Other infections AIDS patients often develop opportunistic infections that present with non specific symptoms  especially low grade fevers and weight loss  These include opportunistic infection with Mycobacterium avium intracellulare and cytomegalovirus  CMV   CMV can cause colitis  as described above  and CMV retinitis can cause blindness  Penicilliosis due to Penicillium marneffei is now the third most common opportunistic infection  after extrapulmonary tuberculosis and cryptococcosis  in HIV positive individuals within the endemic area of Southeast Asia  36  An infection that often goes unrecognized in AIDS patients is Parvovirus B19  Its main consequence is anemia  which is difficult to distinguish from the effects of antiretroviral drugs used to treat AIDS itself  37  Cause For more details on this topic  see HIV  Scanning electron micrograph of HIV 1  colored green  budding from a cultured lymphocyte  A generalized graph of the relationship between HIV copies  viral load  and CD4 counts over the average course of untreated HIV infection  any particular individual s disease course may vary considerably                       CD4  T Lymphocyte count  cells mm                        HIV RNA copies per mL of plasma AIDS is the ultimate clinical consequence of infection with HIV  HIV is a retrovirus that primarily infects vital organs of the human immune system such as CD4  T cells  a subset of T cells   macrophages and dendritic cells  It directly and indirectly destroys CD4  T cells  38  Once the number of CD4  T cells per microliter   L  of blood drops below 200  cellular immunity is lost  Acute HIV infection usually progresses over time to clinical latent HIV infection and then to early symptomatic HIV infection and later to AIDS  which is identified either on the basis of the amount of CD4  T cells remaining in the blood  and or the presence of certain infections  as noted above  39  In the absence of antiretroviral therapy  the median time of progression from HIV infection to AIDS is nine to ten years  and the median survival time after developing AIDS is only 9 2 months  40  However  the rate of clinical disease progression varies widely between individuals  from two weeks up to 20  years  Many factors affect the rate of progression  These include factors that influence the body s ability to defend against HIV such as the infected person s general immune function  41  42  Older people have weaker immune systems  and therefore have a greater risk of rapid disease progression than younger people  Poor access to health care and the existence of coexisting infections such as tuberculosis also may predispose people to faster disease progression  40  43  44  The infected person s genetic inheritance plays an important role and some people are resistant to certain strains of HIV  An example of this is people with the homozygous CCR5  32 variation are resistant to infection with certain strains of HIV  45  HIV is genetically variable and exists as different strains  which cause different rates of clinical disease progression  46  47  48  Sexual transmission Main article  sexually transmitted disease Sexual transmission occurs with the contact between sexual secretions of one person with the rectal  genital or oral mucous membranes of another  Unprotected sexual acts are riskier for the receptive partner than for the insertive partner  and the risk for transmitting HIV through unprotected anal intercourse is greater than the risk from vaginal intercourse or oral sex  However  oral sex is not entirely safe  as HIV can be transmitted through both insertive and receptive oral sex  49  50 Sexual assault greatly increases the risk of HIV transmission as condoms are rarely employed and physical trauma to the vagina or rectum occurs frequently  facilitating the transmission of HIV  51  Drug use has been studied as a possible predictor of HIV transmission  Perry N  Halkitis found that methamphetamine usage does significantly relate to unprotected sexual behavior  The study found methamphetamine users to be at a higher risk for contracting HIV  52  Other sexually transmitted infections  STI  increase the risk of HIV transmission and infection  because they cause the disruption of the normal epithelial barrier by genital ulceration and or microulceration  and by accumulation of pools of HIV susceptible or HIV infected cells  lymphocytes and macrophages  in semen and vaginal secretions  Epidemiological studies from sub Saharan Africa  Europe and North America suggest that genital ulcers  such as those caused by syphilis and or chancroid  increase the risk of becoming infected with HIV by about fourfold  There is also a significant although lesser increase in risk from STIs such as gonorrhea  chlamydia and trichomoniasis  which all cause local accumulations of lymphocytes and macrophages  53  Transmission of HIV depends on the infectiousness of the index case and the susceptibility of the uninfected partner  Infectivity seems to vary during the course of illness and is not constant between individuals  An undetectable plasma viral load does not necessarily indicate a low viral load in the seminal liquid or genital secretions  However  each 10 fold increase in the level of HIV in the blood is associated with an 81  increased rate of HIV transmission  53  54  Women are more susceptible to HIV 1 infection due to hormonal changes  vaginal microbial ecology and physiology  and a higher prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases  55  56  People who have been infected with one strain of HIV can still be infected later on in their lives by other  more virulent strains  Infection is unlikely in a single encounter  High rates of infection have been linked to a pattern of overlapping long term sexual relationships  This allows the virus to quickly spread to multiple partners who in turn infect their partners  A pattern of serial monogamy or occasional casual encounters is associated with lower rates of infection  57  HIV spreads readily through heterosexual sex in Africa  but less so elsewhere  One possibility being researched is that schistosomiasis  which affects up to 50  of women in parts of Africa  damages the lining of the vagina  58  59  Blood products CDC poster from 1989 highlighting the threat of AIDS associated with drug use This transmission route is particularly relevant to intravenous drug users  hemophiliacs and recipients of blood transfusions and blood products  Sharing and reusing syringes contaminated with HIV infected blood represents a major risk for infection with HIV  Needle sharing is the cause of one third of all new HIV infections in North America  China  and Eastern Europe  The risk of being infected with HIV from a single prick with a needle that has been used on an HIV infected person is thought to be about 1 in 150  see table above   Post exposure prophylaxis with anti HIV drugs can further reduce this risk  60  This route can also affect people who give and receive tattoos and piercings  Universal precautions are frequently not followed in both sub Saharan Africa and much of Asia because of both a shortage of supplies and inadequate training  The WHO estimates that approximately 2 5  of all HIV infections in sub Saharan Africa are transmitted through unsafe healthcare injections  61  Because of this  the United Nations General Assembly has urged the nations of the world to implement precautions to prevent HIV transmission by health workers  62  The risk of transmitting HIV to blood transfusion recipients is extremely low in developed countries where improved donor selection and HIV screening is performed  However  according to the WHO  the overwhelming majority of the world s population does not have access to safe blood and between 5  and 10  of the world s HIV infections come from transfusion of infected blood and blood products  63  Perinatal transmission The transmission of the virus from the mother to the child can occur in utero during the last weeks of pregnancy and at childbirth  In the absence of treatment  the transmission rate between a mother and her child during pregnancy  labor and delivery is 25   However  when the mother takes antiretroviral therapy and gives birth by caesarean section  the rate of transmission is just 1   64  The risk of infection is influenced by the viral load of the mother at birth  with the higher the viral load  the higher the risk  Breastfeeding also increases the risk of transmission by about 4    65  Misconceptions Main article  Misconceptions about HIV and AIDS There are many misconceptions about HIV and AIDS  Three of the most common are that AIDS can spread through casual contact  such as shaking hands  hugging  or a casual kiss   that sexual intercourse with a virgin will cure AIDS  and that HIV can infect only homosexual men and drug users  Other misconceptions are that any act of anal intercourse between gay men can lead to HIV infection  and that open discussion of homosexuality and HIV in schools will lead to increased rates of homosexuality and AIDS  66  67  Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of AIDS is complex  68  Ultimately  HIV causes AIDS by depleting CD4  T helper lymphocytes  This weakens the immune system and allows opportunistic infections  T lymphocytes are essential to the immune response and without them  the body cannot fight infections or kill cancerous cells  The mechanism of CD4  T cell depletion differs in the acute and chronic phases  69  During the acute phase  HIV induced cell lysis and killing of infected cells by cytotoxic T cells accounts for CD4  T cell depletion  although apoptosis may also be a factor  During the chronic phase  the consequences of generalized immune activation coupled with the gradual loss of the ability of the immune system to generate new T cells appear to account for the slow decline in CD4  T cell numbers  Although the symptoms of immune deficiency characteristic of AIDS do not appear for years after a person is infected  the bulk of CD4  T cell loss occurs during the first weeks of infection  especially in the intestinal mucosa  which harbors the majority of the lymphocytes found in the body  70  The reason for the preferential loss of mucosal CD4  T cells is that a majority of mucosal CD4  T cells express the CCR5 coreceptor  whereas a small fraction of CD4  T cells in the bloodstream do so  71  HIV seeks out and destroys CCR5 expressing CD4  cells during acute infection  A vigorous immune response eventually controls the infection and initiates the clinically latent phase  However  CD4  T cells in mucosal tissues remain depleted throughout the infection  although enough remain to initially ward off life threatening infections  Continuous HIV replication results in a state of generalized immune activation persisting throughout the chronic phase  72  Immune activation  which is reflected by the increased activation state of immune cells and release of proinflammatory cytokines  results from the activity of several HIV gene products and the immune response to ongoing HIV replication  Another cause is the breakdown of the immune surveillance system of the mucosal barrier caused by the depletion of mucosal CD4  T cells during the acute phase of disease  73  This results in the systemic exposure of the immune system to microbial components of the gut s normal flora  which in a healthy person is kept in check by the mucosal immune system  The activation and proliferation of T cells that results from immune activation provides fresh targets for HIV infection  However  direct killing by HIV alone cannot account for the observed depletion of CD4  T cells since only 0 01 0 10  of CD4  T cells in the blood are infected  A major cause of CD4  T cell loss appears to result from their heightened susceptibility to apoptosis when the immune system remains activated  Although new T cells are continuously produced by the thymus to replace the ones lost  the regenerative capacity of the thymus is slowly destroyed by direct infection of its thymocytes by HIV  Eventually  the minimal number of CD4  T cells necessary to maintain a sufficient immune response is lost  leading to AIDS Cells affected The virus  entering through which ever route  acts primarily on the following cells  74  Lymphoreticular system  CD4  T Helper cells Macrophages Monocytes B lymphocytes Certain endothelial cells Central nervous system  Microglia of the nervous system Astrocytes Oligodendrocytes Neurones   indirectly by the action of cytokines and the gp 120 The effect The virus has cytopathic effects but how it does it is still not quite clear  It can remain inactive in these cells for long periods  though  This effect is hypothesized to be due to the CD4 gp120 interaction  74  The most prominent effect of HIV is its T helper cell suppression and lysis  The cell is simply killed off or deranged to the point of being function less  they do not respond to foreign antigens   The infected B cells can not produce enough antibodies either  Thus the immune system collapses leading to the familiar AIDS complications  like infections and neoplasms  vide supra   Infection of the cells of the CNS cause acute aseptic meningitis  subacute encephalitis  vacuolar myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy  Later it leads to even AIDS dementia complex  The CD4 gp120 interaction  see above  is also permissive to other viruses like Cytomegalovirus  Hepatitis virus  Herpes simplex virus  etc  These viruses lead to further cell damage i  e  cytopathy  Molecular basis For details  see  Structure and genome of HIV HIV replication cycle HIV tropism Diagnosis The diagnosis of AIDS in a person infected with HIV is based on the presence of certain signs or symptoms  Since June 5  1981  many definitions have been developed for epidemiological surveillance such as the Bangui definition and the 1994 expanded World Health Organization AIDS case definition  However  clinical staging of patients was not an intended use for these systems as they are neither sensitive  nor specific  In developing countries  the World Health Organization staging system for HIV infection and disease  using clinical and laboratory data  is used and in developed countries  the Centers for Disease Control  CDC  Classification System is used  World Health Organization Main article  WHO Disease Staging System for HIV Infection and Disease In 1990  the World Health Organization  WHO  grouped these infections and conditions together by introducing a staging system for patients infected with HIV 1  75  An update took place in September 2005  Most of these conditions are opportunistic infections that are easily treatable in healthy people  Stage I  HIV infection is asymptomatic and not categorized as AIDS Stage II  includes minor mucocutaneous manifestations and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections Stage III  includes unexplained chronic diarrhea for longer than a month  severe bacterial infections and pulmonary tuberculosis Stage IV  includes toxoplasmosis of the brain  candidiasis of the esophagus  trachea  bronchi or lungs and Kaposi s sarcoma  these diseases are indicators of AIDS  Center for Disease Control Main article  CDC Classification System for HIV Infection There are two main definitions for AIDS  both produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC   The older definition is to referring to AIDS using the diseases that were associated with it  for example  lymphadenopathy  the disease after which the discoverers of HIV originally named the virus  76  77  In 1993  the CDC expanded their definition of AIDS to include all HIV positive people with a CD4  T cell count below 200 per  L of blood or 14  of all lymphocytes  78  The majority of new AIDS cases in developed countries use either this definition or the pre 1993 CDC definition  The AIDS diagnosis still stands even if  after treatment  the CD4  T cell count rises to above 200 per  L of blood or other AIDS defining illnesses are cured  HIV test Main article  HIV test Many people are unaware that they are infected with HIV  79  Less than 1  of the sexually active urban population in Africa has been tested  and this proportion is even lower in rural populations  Furthermore  only 0 5  of pregnant women attending urban health facilities are counseled  tested or receive their test results  Again  this proportion is even lower in rural health facilities  79  Therefore  donor blood and blood products used in medicine and medical research are screened for HIV  HIV tests are usually performed on venous blood  Many laboratories use fourth generation screening tests which detect anti HIV antibody  IgG and IgM  and the HIV p24 antigen  The detection of HIV antibody or antigen in a patient previously known to be negative is evidence of HIV infection  Individuals whose first specimen indicates evidence of HIV infection will have a repeat test on a second blood sample to confirm the results  The window period  the time between initial infection and the development of detectable antibodies against the infection  can vary since it can take 3 6  months to seroconvert and to test positive  Detection of the virus using polymerase chain reaction  PCR  during the window period is possible  and evidence suggests that an infection may often be detected earlier than when using a fourth generation EIA screening test  Positive results obtained by PCR are confirmed by antibody tests  80  Routinely used HIV tests for infection in neonates and infants  i  e   patients younger than 2 years   81  born to HIV positive mothers  have no value because of the presence of maternal antibody to HIV in the child s blood  HIV infection can only be diagnosed by PCR  testing for HIV pro viral DNA in the children s lymphocytes  82  Prevention Estimated per act risk for

Aids   No Aids road sign in Spiti Valley  Himachel Pradesh  India  2010 AIDS Clinic  McLeod Ganj  Himachel Pradesh  India  2010 The three main transmission routes of HIV are sexual contact  exposure to infected body fluids or tissues  and from mother to fetus or child during the perinatal period  It is possible to find HIV in the saliva  tears  and urine of infected individuals  but there are no recorded cases of infection by these secretions  and the risk of infection is negligible  90  Anti retroviral treatment of infected patients also significantly reduces their ability to transmit HIV to others  by reducing the amount of virus in their bodily fluids to undetectable levels  91  Sexual contact The majority of HIV infections are acquired through unprotected sexual relations between partners  one of whom has HIV  The primary mode of HIV infection worldwide is through sexual contact between members of the opposite sex  92  93  94  During a sexual act  only male or female condoms can reduce the risk of infection with HIV and other STDs  The best evidence to date indicates that typical condom use reduces the risk of heterosexual HIV transmission by approximately 80  over the long term  though the benefit is likely to be higher if condoms are used correctly on every occasion  95  Studies on couples where one partner is infected show that with consistent condom use  HIV infection rates for the uninfected partner are below 1  per year  96  Prevention strategies are well known in developed countries  but epidemiological and behavioral studies in Europe and North America suggest that a substantial minority of young people continue to engage in high risk practices despite HIV AIDS knowledge  underestimating their own risk of becoming infected with HIV  97  98  The male latex condom  if used correctly without oil based lubricants  is the single most effective available technology to reduce the sexual transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections  Manufacturers recommend that oil based lubricants such as petroleum jelly  butter  and lard not be used with latex condoms  because they dissolve the latex  making the condoms porous  If lubrication is desired  manufacturers recommend using water based lubricants  Oil based lubricants can be used with polyurethane condoms  99  Female condoms are commonly made from polyurethane  but are also made from nitrile and latex  They are larger than male condoms and have a stiffened ring shaped opening with an inner ring designed to be inserted into the vagina keeping the condom in place  inserting the female condom requires squeezing this ring  Female condoms have been shown to be an important HIV prevention strategy by preliminary studies which suggest that overall protected sexual acts increase relative to unprotected sexual acts where female condoms are available  100  At present  availability of female condoms is very low and the price remains prohibitive for many women  Randomized controlled trials have shown that male circumcision lowers the risk of HIV infection among heterosexual men by up to 60   101  It is expected that this procedure will be actively promoted in many of the countries affected by HIV  although doing so will involve confronting a number of practical  cultural and attitudinal issues  However  programs to encourage condom use  including providing them free to those in poverty  are estimated to be 95 times more cost effective than circumcision at reducing the rate of HIV in sub Saharan Africa  102  Some experts fear that a lower perception of vulnerability among circumcised men may result in more sexual risk taking behavior  thus negating its preventive effects  103  However  one randomized controlled trial indicated that adult male circumcision was not associated with increased HIV risk behavior  104  Studies of HIV infection rates among women who have undergone female genital cutting  FGC  have reported mixed results  for details see Female genital cutting  A three year study in South Africa  completed in 2010  found that an anti microbial vaginal gel could reduce infection rates among women by 50  after one year of use  and by 39  after two and a half years  The results of the study  which was conducted by the Centre for the Aids Programme of Research in South Africa  CAPRISA   were published in Science magazine in July 2010  and were then presented at an international aids conference in Vienna  105  Body fluid exposure Health care workers can reduce exposure to HIV by employing precautions to reduce the risk of exposure to contaminated blood  These precautions include barriers such as gloves  masks  protective eyeware or shields  and gowns or aprons which prevent exposure of the skin or mucous membranes to blood borne pathogens  Frequent and thorough washing of the skin immediately after being contaminated with blood or other bodily fluids can reduce the chance of infection  Finally  sharp objects like needles  scalpels and glass  are carefully disposed of to prevent needlestick injuries with contaminated items  106  Since intravenous drug use is an important factor in HIV transmission in developed countries  harm reduction strategies such as needle exchange programmes are used in attempts to reduce the infections caused by drug abuse  107  108  Mother to child Current recommendations state that when replacement feeding  as with a wet nurse  is acceptable  feasible  affordable  sustainable and safe  HIV infected mothers should avoid breast feeding their infant  However  if this is not the case  exclusive breast feeding is recommended during the first months of life and discontinued as soon as possible  109  Education One way to change risky behavior is health education  Several studies citation needed  have shown the positive impact of education and health literacy on cautious sex behavior  Education works only if it leads to higher health literacy and general cognitive ability  This ability is relevant to understand the relationship between own risky behavior and possible outcomes like HIV transmission  110  In July 2010  a UNAIDS Inter Agency Task Team  IATT  on Education commissioned literature review found there was a need for more research into non African 111  clarification needed   especially non South African contexts   more research on the actual implementation of sex education programmes  such as teacher training  access to related services through schools and the community  or parental attitudes to HIV and AIDS education  and more longitudinal studies on the deeper complexities of the relationship between education and HIV  112  Management See also HIV Treatment and Antiretroviral drug  There is currently no publicly available HIV vaccine or cure for HIV or AIDS  The only known methods of prevention are based on avoiding exposure to the virus or  failing that  an antiretroviral treatment directly after a highly significant exposure  called post exposure prophylaxis  PEP   113  PEP has a very demanding four week schedule of dosage  It also has very unpleasant side effects including diarrhea  malaise  nausea and fatigue  114  Antiviral therapy Abacavir   a nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor  NARTI or NRTI  The chemical structure of Abacavir Current treatment for HIV infection consists of highly active antiretroviral therapy  or HAART  115  This has been highly beneficial to many HIV infected individuals since its introduction in 1996 when the protease inhibitor based HAART initially became available  13  Current optimal HAART options consist of combinations  or  cocktails   consisting of at least three drugs belonging to at least two types  or  classes    of antiretroviral agents  Typical regimens consist of two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors  NARTIs or NRTIs  plus either a protease inhibitor or a non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor  NNRTI   Because HIV disease progression in children is more rapid than in adults  and laboratory parameters are less predictive of risk for disease progression  particularly for young infants  treatment recommendations are more aggressive for children than for adults  116  In developed countries where HAART is available  doctors assess the viral load  CD4 counts  rapidity of CD4 decline and patient readiness while deciding when to recommend initiating treatment  117  Traditionally  treatment has been recommended for otherwise asymptomatic patients when CD4 cell counts fall to 200 250 cells per microliter of blood  However  beginning treatment earlier  at a CD4 level of 350 cells microliter  may significantly reduce the risk of death  118  Standard goals of HAART include improvement in the patient s quality of life  reduction in complications  and reduction of HIV viremia below the limit of detection  but it does not cure the patient of HIV nor does it prevent the return  once treatment is stopped  of high blood levels of HIV  often HAART resistant  119  120  Moreover  it would take more than the lifetime of an individual to be cleared of HIV infection using HAART  121  Despite this  many HIV infected individuals have experienced remarkable improvements in their general health and quality of life  which has led to the plummeting of HIV associated morbidity and mortality  122  123  124  In the absence of HAART  progression from HIV infection to AIDS occurs at a median of between nine to ten years and the median survival time after developing AIDS is only 9 2  months  40  HAART is thought to increase survival time by between 4 and 12  years  125  126  For some patients  which can be more than fifty percent of patients  HAART achieves far less than optimal results  due to medication intolerance side effects  prior ineffective antiretroviral therapy and infection with a drug resistant strain of HIV  Non adherence and non persistence with therapy are the major reasons why some people do not benefit from HAART  127  The reasons for non adherence and non persistence are varied  Major psychosocial issues include poor access to medical care  inadequate social supports  psychiatric disease and drug abuse  HAART regimens can also be complex and thus hard to follow  with large numbers of pills taken frequently  128  129  130  Side effects can also deter people from persisting with HAART  these include lipodystrophy  dyslipidaemia  diarrhoea  insulin resistance  an increase in cardiovascular risks and birth defects  131  Anti retroviral drugs are expensive  and the majority of the world s infected individuals do not have access to medications and treatments for HIV and AIDS  However  the costs of anti retroviral drugs have fallen recently in low income countries  Moreover  patients  quality of life indices benefit from anti retroviral treatment especially if healthcare services are adequate  132  In the absence of a cure for AIDS  anti retroviral treatment is likely to be a cost effective strategy for enhancing well being of AIDS patients and their dependents  Complementary and alternative medicine In the US  approximately 60  of HIV patients use various forms of complementary or alternative medicine  CAM   133  Despite the widespread use of CAM by people living with HIV AIDS  the effectiveness of these therapies has not been established  134  A 2005 Cochrane review of existing high quality scientific evidence concluded   There is insufficient evidence to support the use of herbal medicines in HIV infected individuals and AIDS patients    135 Acupuncture has only been proposed for symptomatic relief  but not to treat or cure HIV or AIDS  136  Vitamin or mineral supplementation has shown benefit in some studies  Daily doses of selenium can suppress HIV viral burden with an associated improvement of the CD4 count  Selenium can be used as an adjunct therapy to standard antiviral treatments  137  138  but cannot itself cure the infection  More evidence is needed before it can be established that selenium supplementation reduces mortality rates  There is some evidence that vitamin A supplementation in children reduces mortality and improves growth  139  A large Tanzanian trial in immunologically and nutritionally compromised pregnant and lactating women showed a number of benefits to daily multivitamin supplementation for both mothers and children  139  Dietary intake of micronutrients at RDA levels by HIV infected adults is recommended by the World Health Organization  WHO   140  The WHO further states that several studies indicate that supplementation of vitamin A  zinc  and iron can produce adverse effects in HIV positive adults  140  Prognosis Without treatment  the net median survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years  depending on the HIV subtype  8  and the median survival rate after diagnosis of AIDS in resource limited settings where treatment is not available ranges between 6 and 19 months  depending on the study  141  In areas where it is widely available  the development of HAART as effective therapy for HIV infection and AIDS reduced the death rate from this disease by 80   and raised the life expectancy for a newly diagnosed HIV infected person to about 20 years  142  As new treatments continue to be developed and because HIV continues to evolve resistance to treatments  estimates of survival time are likely to continue to change  Without antiretroviral therapy  death normally occurs within a year after the individual progresses to AIDS  40  Most patients die from opportunistic infections or malignancies associated with the progressive failure of the immune system  143  The rate of clinical disease progression varies widely between individuals and has been shown to be affected by many factors such as host susceptibility and immune function 41  42  45  health care and co infections  40  143  as well as which particular strain of the virus is involved  47  144  145  Even with anti retroviral treatment  over the long term HIV infected patients may experience neurocognitive disorders  osteoporosis  neuropathy  cancers  nephropathy  and cardiovascular disease  It is not always clear whether these conditions result from the infection  related complications  or are side effects of treatment  146  147  136  31  32  148  131  149  The largest cause of AIDS morbidity today  globally  is tuberculosis co infection  see AIDS Pulmonary infections  In Africa  HIV is the single most important factor contributing to the increase in the incidence of TB since 1990  150  Epidemiology Main article  AIDS pandemic This section is outdated  Please update this section to reflect recent events or newly available information  Please see the talk page for more information   December 2009  Estimated prevalence of HIV among young adults  15 49  per country at the end of 2005  Estimated number of people living with HIV AIDS by country Disability adjusted life year for HIV and AIDS per 100 000  inhabitants as of 2004    no data     10   10 25   25 50   50 100   100 500   500 1000   1000 2500   2500 5000   5000 7500   7500 10000   10000 50000     50000 The AIDS pandemic can also be seen as several epidemics of separate subtypes  the major factors in its spread are sexual transmission and vertical transmission from mother to child at birth and through breast milk  6  Despite recent  improved access to antiretroviral treatment and care in many regions of the world  the AIDS pandemic claimed an estimated 2 1  million  range 1 9 2 4  million  lives in 2007 of which an estimated 330 000 were children under 15  years  8  Globally  an estimated 33 2  million people lived with HIV in 2007  including 2 5  million children  An estimated 2 5  million  range 1 8 4 1  million  people were newly infected in 2007  including 420 000 children  8  Sub Saharan Africa remains by far the worst affected region  In 2007 it contained an estimated 68  of all people living with AIDS and 76  of all AIDS deaths  with 1 7  million new infections bringing the number of people living with HIV to 22 5  million  and with 11 4  million AIDS orphans living in the region  Unlike other regions  most people living with HIV in sub Saharan Africa in 2007  61   were women  Adult prevalence in 2007 was an estimated 5 0   and AIDS continued to be the single largest cause of mortality in this region  8  South Africa has the largest population of HIV patients in the world  followed by Nigeria and India  151 South  amp  South East Asia are second worst affected  in 2007 this region contained an estimated 18  of all people living with AIDS  and an estimated 300 000 deaths from AIDS  8  India has an estimated 2 5  million infections and an estimated adult prevalence of 0 36   8 Life expectancy has fallen dramatically in the worst affected countries  for example  in 2006 it was estimated that it had dropped from 65 to 35 years in Botswana  6  In the United States  young African American women are also at unusually high risk for HIV infection  152  African Americans make up 10  of the population but about half of the HIV AIDS cases nationwide  153  This is due in part to a lack of information about AIDS and a perception that they are not vulnerable  as well as to limited access to health care resources and a higher likelihood of sexual contact with at risk male sexual partners  154  There are also geographic disparities in AIDS prevalence in the United States  where it is most common in the large metropoliton areas of the east coast and California and in urban areas of the deep south  155  Approximately 1 1  million persons are living with HIV AIDS in the United States  and more than 56 000 new infections occur every single year  156  History and origin Main article  Origin of AIDS AIDS was first reported June 5  1981  when the U  S  Centers for Disease Control  CDC  recorded a cluster of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia  now still classified as PCP but known to be caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii  in five homosexual men in Los Angeles  157  In the beginning  the CDC did not have an official name for the disease  often referring to it by way of the diseases that were associated with it  for example  lymphadenopathy  the disease after which the discoverers of HIV originally named the virus  76  77  They also used Kaposi s Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections  the name by which a task force had been set up in 1981  158  In the general press  the term GRID  which stood for gay related immune deficiency  had been coined  159  The CDC  in search of a name  and looking at the infected communities coined  the 4H disease    as it seemed to single out Haitians  homosexuals  hemophiliacs  and heroin users  160  However  after determining that AIDS was not isolated to the gay community  158  the term GRID became misleading and AIDS was introduced at a meeting in July 1982  161  By September 1982 the CDC started using the name AIDS  and properly defined the illness  162  The earliest known positive identification of the HIV 1 virus comes from the Congo in 1959 and 1960 though genetic studies indicate that it passed into the human population from chimpanzees around fifty years earlier  11  A 2007 study states that a strain of HIV 1 probably moved from Africa to Haiti and then entered the United States around 1969  163  HIV descends from the related simian immunodeficiency virus  SIV   which infects apes and monkeys in Africa  There is evidence that humans who participate in bushmeat activities  either as hunters or as bushmeat vendors  commonly acquire SIV  164  However  only a few of these infections were able to cause epidemics in humans  and all did so in the late 19th early 20th century  To explain why HIV became epidemic only by that time  there are several theories  each invoking specific driving factors that may have promoted SIV adaptation to humans  or initial spread  social changes following colonialism  165  rapid transmission of SIV through unsafe or unsterile injections  that is  injections in which the needle is reused without being sterilised   166  colonial abuses and unsafe smallpox vaccinations or injections  167  or prostitution and the concomitant high frequency of genital ulcer diseases  such as syphilis  in nascent colonial cities  168  169  See the main article Origin of AIDS  One of the first high profile victims of AIDS was the American Rock Hudson  a gay actor who had been married and divorced earlier in life  who died on 2 October 1985 having announced that he was suffering from the virus on 25 July that year  It had been diagnosed during 1984  170  A notable British casualty of AIDS that year was Nicholas Eden  a gay Member of Parliament and son of the late prime minister Anthony Eden  171  172  The virus claimed perhaps its most famous victim yet on 24 November 1991  when British rock star Freddie Mercury  lead singer of the band Queen  died from an AIDS related illness having only announced that he was suffering from the illness the previous day  173  However he had been diagnosed as HIV positive during 1987  174  One of the first high profile heterosexual victims of the virus was Arthur Ashe  the American tennis player  He was diagnosed as HIV positive on 31 August 1988  having contracted the virus from blood transfusions during heart surgery earlier in the 1980s  Further tests within 24 hours of the initial diagnosis revealed that Ashe had AIDS  but he did not tell the public about his diagnosis until April 1992  175  He died  aged 49  as a result of the AIDS virus on 6 February 1993  176  A more controversial theory known as the OPV AIDS hypothesis suggests that the AIDS epidemic was inadvertently started in the late 1950s in the Belgian Congo by Hilary Koprowski s research into a poliomyelitis vaccine  177  178  According to scientific consensus  the available evidence does not support this scenario  179  180  181  Society and culture Stigma Ryan White became a poster child for HIV after being expelled from school because of his infection  Main article  Discrimination against people with HIV AIDS AIDS stigma exists around the world in a variety of ways  including ostracism  rejection  discrimination and avoidance of HIV infected people  compulsory HIV testing without prior consent or protection of confidentiality  violence against HIV infected individuals or people who are perceived to be infected with HIV  and the quarantine of HIV infected individuals  182  Stigma related violence or the fear of violence prevents many people from seeking HIV testing  returning for their results  or securing treatment  possibly turning what could be a manageable chronic illness into a death sentence and perpetuating the spread of HIV  183  AIDS stigma has been further divided into the following three categories  Instrumental AIDS stigma a reflection of the fear and apprehension that are likely to be associated with any deadly and transmissible illness  184  Symbolic AIDS stigma the use of HIV AIDS to express attitudes toward the social groups or lifestyles perceived to be associated with the disease  184  Courtesy AIDS stigma stigmatization of people connected to the issue of HIV AIDS or HIV  positive people  185  Often  AIDS stigma is expressed in conjunction with one or more other stigmas  particularly those associated with homosexuality  bisexuality  promiscuity  prostitution  and intravenous drug use  In many developed countries  there is an association between AIDS and homosexuality or bisexuality  and this association is correlated with higher levels of sexual prejudice such as anti homosexual attitudes  186  There is also a perceived association between AIDS and all male male sexual behavior  including sex between uninfected men  184  Economic impact Main article  Economic impact of AIDS Changes in life expectancy in some hard hit African countries                       Botswana                     Zimbabwe                     Kenya                     South Africa                     Uganda HIV and AIDS affects economic growth by reducing the availability of human capital  187  Without proper nutrition  health care and medicine that is available in developed countries  large numbers of people suffer and die from AIDS related complications  They will not only be unable to work  but will also require significant medical care  The forecast is that this will probably cause a collapse of economies and societies in countries with a significant AIDS population  In some heavily infected areas  the epidemic has left behind many orphans cared for by elderly grandparents  188  The increased mortality has results in a smaller skilled population and labor force  This smaller labor force consists of increasingly younger people  with reduced knowledge and work experience leading to reduced productivity  An increase in workers  time off to look after sick family members or for sick leave lowers productivity  Increased mortality reduces the mechanisms that generate human capital and investment in people  through loss of income and the death of parents  By affecting mainly young adults  AIDS reduces the taxable population  in turn reducing the resources available for public expenditures such as education and health services not related to AIDS resulting in increasing pressure for the state s finances and slower growth of the economy  This results in a slower growth of the tax base  an effect that is reinforced if there are growing expenditures on treating the sick  training  to replace sick workers   sick pay and caring for AIDS orphans  This is especially true if the sharp increase in adult mortality shifts the responsibility and blame from the family to the government in caring for these orphans  188  On the level of the household  AIDS results in both the loss of income and increased spending on healthcare by the household  The income effects of this lead to spending reduction as well as a substitution effect away from education and towards healthcare and funeral spending  A study in C te d Ivoire showed that households with an HIV AIDS patient spent twice as much on medical expenses as other households  189  Religion and AIDS Main article  Religion and AIDS The topic of religion and AIDS has become highly controversial in the past twenty years  primarily because many prominent religious leaders have publicly declared their opposition to the use of condoms  190  191  Full citation needed  which scientists feel is currently the only means of stopping the epidemic  citation needed  However  there is a growing openness to faith based methods due to the failure rates associated with condoms  191  Other issues involve religious participation in global health care services citation needed  and collaboration with secular organizations such as UNAIDS and the World Health Organization  citation needed  The religious approach to prevent the spread of AIDS according to a report by American health expert Matthew Hanley titled The Catholic Church and the Global Aids Crisis argues that cultural changes are needed including a re emphasis on fidelity within marriage and sexual abstinence outside of it  191  In addition to prevention  some religious groups have interrupted the treatment of AIDS  According to the African Health Policy Network  some churches in London claim that prayer will cure AIDS and the Hackney based Centre for the Study of Sexual Health and HIV reports that several people have stopped taking their medication  sometimes on the direct advice of their pastor  leading to a number of deaths  192  The Synagogue Church Of All Nations advertise an  anointing water  to promote God s healing  although the group deny advising people to stop taking medication  192  and US patent application 2001051133 similarly suggests that intravenous pure distilled water will eradicate HIV through the mercy of God  193  AIDS denialism Main article  AIDS denialism A small number of activists question the connection between HIV and AIDS  194  the existence of HIV  195  or the validity of current treatment methods  even going so far as to claim that the drug therapy itself was the cause of AIDS deaths   Though these claims have been examined and thoroughly rejected by the scientific community  196  they continue to be promulgated through the Internet 197  and have had a significant political impact  In South Africa  former President Thabo Mbeki s embrace of AIDS denialism resulted in an ineffective governmental response to the AIDS epidemic that has been blamed for hundreds of thousands of AIDS related deaths  198  199  AIDS conspiracy theories Operation INFEKTION was a worldwide Soviet active measures operation to spread information that the United States had created HIV AIDS  Surveys show that a significant number of people believed   and continue to believe   in such claims  200  Research directions  AIDS research  redirects here  For the journal formerly known as AIDS Research  see AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses  It has been postulated that only a vaccine can halt the pandemic because a vaccine would possibly cost less  thus being affordable for developing countries  and would not require daily treatments  However  even after almost 30  years of research  HIV 1 remains a difficult target for a vaccine  201  Research to improve current treatments includes decreasing side effects of current drugs  further simplifying drug regimens to improve adherence  and determining the best sequence of regimens to manage drug resistance  A number of studies have shown that measures to prevent opportunistic infections can be beneficial when treating patients with HIV infection or AIDS  Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for patients who are not infected with these viruses and are at risk of becoming infected  202  Patients with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia  PCP   and many patients may benefit from prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and Cryptococcus meningitis as well  114  Researchers have discovered an abzyme that can destroy the protein gp120 CD4 binding site  This protein is common to all HIV variants as it is the attachment point for B lymphocytes and subsequent compromising of the immune system  203  Researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem have also discovered that a combination of peptides that stimulate integration together with the protease inhibitor Ro 31 8959 caused apoptotic cell death of HIV infected cells with total extermination of the virus but did not harm healthy cells  204  205  It could take several years before a commercial treatment based on this discovery becomes available  206  Reactivation of the retrocyclin pseudogene has been proposed as a possible prevention method  as was demonstrated in a proof of concept study in tissue culture cells  207  In Berlin  Germany  a 42 year old leukemia patient  Timothy Ray Brown  also referred to as the  Berlin Patient    208  infected with HIV for more than a decade was given an experimental transplant of bone marrow with cells that contained an unusual natural variant of the CCR5 cell surface receptor by a team around Gero H tter  This CCR5  32 variant has been shown to make some cells from people who are born with it resistant to infection with some strains of HIV  Almost two years after the transplant  and even after the patient reportedly stopped taking antiretroviral medications  HIV has not been detected in the patient s blood  209  As of December 2010  three years after the transplant  Brown was still free of any detectable HIV in his blood and was described  in a paper in the journal Blood  as  cured   208  210
