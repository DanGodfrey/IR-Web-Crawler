Blindfold  Aldine and Hisako  Armor  Ichiki  Runaway Klara Prast and Special Agent Abigail Brand  along with S W O R D   the organization she commands  Whedon is the second writer of the critically

 In February 2009  Astonishing X Men  6  which depicted the return of Colossus to the title  and concluded Whedon s first story arc on that title  was named by Marvel Comics readers the  65 in Marvel s Top 70 Comics of all time  41   edit  Online media Whedon with Jason Segel and Neil Patrick Harris in September 2011 In 2005 he released a series of online shorts titled the R  Tam sessions  starring himself and Summer Glau  which served as a form of viral marketing for Serenity  In 2007  he launched a free webcomic  titled Sugarshock  hosted on Dark Horse comic s Myspace page  42  In March 2008  Whedon teamed up with his brothers Zack Whedon and Jed Whedon  along with Jed s then fianc e Maurissa Tancharoen to write  compose and produce the musical superhero spoof  Dr  Horrible s Sing Along Blog  The musical stars Neil Patrick Harris  Nathan Fillion and Felicia Day  Whedon conceived of Dr  Horrible over the year before and production took place over seven days during the Writers Guild strike  The project was freely available online from July 15 until July 20  In August  Whedon released a new Serenity Firefly comic free online Serenity  The Other Half  43  In September  Dr  Horrible s Sing Along Blog Soundtrack  made the top 40 Album list despite being a digital exclusive only available on iTunes  44  The Soundtrack was successful enough to pay its crew and all its bills  45  In February 2009  he stated that after his series Dollhouse is over  whether by cancellation or reaching its end  that he plans on putting his efforts purely into on line content like Dr  Horrible  46  In the Dr  Horrible bonus feature Commentary  The Musical   Joss sings the song  Heart  Broken   about the crippling scrutiny and commercialisation of producing fiction for a modern consumer audience   edit  Unrealized projects Whedon had a number of planned television projects that have become stuck in development or terminally stalled  Among these was a Buffy animated series  a set of made for television movies for The WB based on Angel and Buffy characters  and Ripper  a proposed BBC pilot about Rupert Giles  Ripper was announced to be in development at the San Diego Comic Con 2007  The development process was set to begin in 2008 and Ripper to be shown that summer but the pilot has not materialized yet due to characters rights  47  Early in his career Whedon sold two spec scripts that have not yet been produced  Suspension and Afterlife  He sold Suspension for  750 000 with an additional  250 000 if production commences  48  It has been described as  Die Hard on a bridge   A year later in 1994 he sold Afterlife for  1 5 million with an additional  500 000 if production commences  As of 2000 Andy Tennant was in talks to direct and rewrite  49  In Afterlife are precursors to many of the themes Whedon would later explore in Dollhouse  The script is about Daniel Hoffstetter  a government scientist  who awakes after dying to discover his mind has been imprinted on a mind wiped body  50  Whedon had been signed to write and direct Warner Bros   adaptation of Wonder Woman but on February 3  2007  Whedon announced that he would no longer be involved with the project   We just saw different movies  and at the price range this kind of movie hangs in  that s never gonna work  Non sympatico  It happens all the time   51  Late in 2009  Whedon made a humorous bid of  10 000 for control of future Terminator material  52  He was rebuffed at that time and it is not known if he has plans to attempt this again   edit  Goners Goners was announced in 2005  According to Variety magazine  it is a fantasy thriller under development by Universal Studios  and is to be produced by Mary Parent and Scott Stuber  53  However  according to Whedon s latest comments  the script is still in rewrites and has not been greenlit for production  54  When asked about the film itself during an interview  Whedon said  It is a fantasy thriller  it is pretty dark and it s all me  So people will pretty much know what that means if they look at my body of work  But it s a new universe set in the present day with a new concept for me and a new bunch of characters  It s been a long time since I got to do that  so that s really fun  55  From an interview with Fanboy Radio  I ve been seeing a lot of horror movies that are torture porn  where kids we don t care about are mutilated for hours  and I just cannot abide them    it s an antidote to that very kind of film  the horror movie with the expendable human beings in it  Because I don t believe any human beings are  56   edit  Common themes and motifs in Whedon s works  edit  Feminism Whedon identifies himself as a feminist and gives his mother  Lee Stearns  credit for inspiring his feminist worldview  When Roseanne Barr asked him how he could write so well for women  he replied   If you met my mom  you wouldn t ask   57  The character Kitty Pryde from the X Men comics was an early model for Whedon s strong teenage girl characters   If there s a bigger influence on Buffy than Kitty  I don t know what it was  She was an adolescent girl finding out she has great power and dealing with it   58  Kitty Pryde was one of the main characters in Whedon s run on Astonishing X Men  Whedon was honored at an Equality Now benefit in 2006   Honoring Men on the Front Lines   59  and his fans raised a considerable amount of money in support of the organization  60   edit  Dialogue The dialogue in Joss Whedon s shows and movies usually involves pop culture references both notable and obscure  and the turning of nouns into adjectives by adding a  y  at the end of the word   listy    According to one of the Buffy writers   It s just the way that Joss actually talks   61  Whedon also heavily favors the suffix  age  Linkage  Lurkage  Poofage  Postage  Scrollage  Slayage   62  Also  phrasal verbs usually ending with  out  are changed into direct verbs  for example  freak  rather than  freak out    bail  rather than  bail out   or  hang  rather than  hang out   Whedon also tends to change adjectives into nouns such as  happy    shiny   positive thing    bad   mistake    funny   joke    for example  a character may say  I made a funny  instead of  I made a joke   citation needed  So many of Whedon s altered usages  new words  and heavily popularized words have entered the common usage that PBS in their article series  Do You Speak American  included an entire section on  Slayer Slang   63  In an issue of Buffy Season Eight where Buffy travels to the future  Whedon writes Buffy s reaction to the future dialect of Manhattan  this allows Whedon to comment on Buffy s distinctive style of dialogue   Buffy blames herself for what s happened to the English language  and there s a lot of hubris in that joke  I like to think that adding Y s to words that don t usually have Y s is going to destroy the whole fabric of our society    64   edit  Spiritual and philosophical beliefs Whedon has identified himself as an atheist on multiple occasions  When interviewed by The A V  Club on October 9  2002  Whedon answered the question  Is there a God   with one word   No   The interviewer followed up with   That s it  end of story  no   Whedon answered   Absolutely not  That s a very important and necessary thing to learn   65  In one of the Buffy DVD commentaries  Whedon comments that  I don t believe in the  sky bully    referring to God under a name coined by his colleague Tim Minear  66  In addition  during a question and answer session found on the Serenity DVD with fans of the Firefly series at Fox Studios in Sydney  he identifies himself as an atheist and absurdist  Whedon has also spoken about existentialism  On the Firefly DVD set  Whedon explains in detail how existentialism  and more specifically the book Nausea  by Jean Paul Sartre  was used as a basis for the episode  Objects in Space   67  On this commentary he claimed interest in existential ideas and described the impact of Nausea on his early life  Whedon also identifies himself as a humanist  In April 2009  the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard University presented Whedon with the 2009 Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism  68   edit  Frequent casting Actor Buffy the Vampire Slayer  1997 2003  Angel  1999 2004  Firefly  2002  Serenity  2005  Dr  Horrible s Sing
