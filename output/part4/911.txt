storyline spinning off from the House of M limited series  It focuses on the ramifications of the Scarlet Witch stripping nearly all of the mutant population of their powers  thereby reducing a society of millions to one of scant hundreds  This event  which occurred on November 2 according to X Men  vol  2   191  is known as  M Day  in the Marvel Universe  Contents 1 Overview 2 Criticism 3

the Excalibur team in New Excalibur  focusing on Pete Wisdom looking for Captain Britain to head up a new British super team  as well as the relaunch of X Factor from the MadroX miniseries  It also includes several mini series Son of M starring a depowered Quicksilver  Generation M focusing on other depowered characters  Sentinel Squad O N E showing the latest iteration of the mutant hunting Sentinels to be robots piloted by humans  X Men  Deadly Genesis  and X Men  The 198 and continues throughout the Marvel Universe  particularly in the X Men related titles  One consequence is an upswing of anti mutant sentiment  especially among certain religious groups  who consider M Day to be God s judgment against mutant kind  It has been confirmed through various sources that there are considerably more than 198 mutants remaining the number has been referred to as  symbolic  rather than actual  and in The 198 Files is said to be the earliest confirmed number  Numbers for pre Decimation mutants vary from  over a million   House of M  8  to 14 million  New X Men  115  where it is said that the 16 million mutants who died on Genosha was around  over half  of the estimated global mutant population of 30 million mutants   giving a population  if the commonly used 90  depowered figure is true  of between one hundred thousand and one and a half million  Based on the mathematical comparisons of the oft repeated 198 and several million  Marvel reevaluated the 90  figure into  Over 99    as shown in Civil War  Battle Damage Report when Iron Man comments on the Post CW world  1  Both Hank Pym and Beast note shortly after the event that it is impossible for the energy that certain mutants controlled to simply have vanished  and that it must have been  sent  somewhere  As would later be revealed in New Avengers  most of this energy became a sentient entity called  The Collective   who has since come into violent conflict with the Avengers  In addition  a portion of the energy revived the body of Gabriel Summers  brother of both Alex  Havok  and Scott Summers  Cyclops   who had been trapped in space for many years following the defeat of Krakoa  as depicted in X Men  Deadly Genesis limited series   edit  Criticism According to Marvel Editor In Chief  Joe Quesada  the Decimation event was designed to reduce the number of mutant characters in the Marvel Universe as he felt the number of mutants had gotten out of hand after forty years of publishing  2  Most criticisms by fans have been aimed at inconsistencies regarding the roster of mutants who retained their powers after the event  For example  in the Generation M mini series  several characters were considered depowered  even though they retained their physical mutations  The Civil War Files one shot revealed that the US government s assessment of the number of mutants on Earth may not be accurate  which allowed Marvel to change the number of depowered mutants  Additionally  characters such as Namor and the Great Lakes Avengers  who are described as mutants but not particularly tied to the X Men series of books  have not been affected by the event   edit  Depowered mutants Wizard magazine published a speculative list of supposedly decimated characters  which Marvel Comics dismissed as including a number of mutants who still have their powers 3  and also includes non mutant characters  The list therefore is just a guideline       Depowered      Repowered      Remutated      Dead  depowered      Dead after being repowered      Dead after being remutated

first victim killed by a demon possessed Wolverine  as he could no longer teleport  Notes  Sunfire  while depowered long before M Day because of Rogue was listed among the energies in the Collective  Seeing that Rogue retained his powers  how this is possible remains unknown  Many mutants still remain active although they are depowered  they include the New Warriors Blackwing  Tempest  Wondra and Wind Dancer  the X Cell as well as Brass and El Aguila as reported in Civil War  Battle Damage Report It has been revealed in the  Endgangered Species  storyline that latent mutants  such as Charlotte Jones  have also lost their X gene after M Day  It appears that some characters  for an as of yet unexplained reason  have reverted to normal at a slower rate than others  This includes Beak  Stacy X  and Marrow  who still is not normal   Iceman is not repowered  since he never lost his powers in the first place  After the events of M Day he developed a mental block  which suppressed his secondary mutation and blocked his powers  this may also be the case for Mulholland Black  Archangel only pretended to be depowered as seen in Generation M  4 and  5  As revealed in X Factor  50  Layla Miller had powers before M Day but not the ones she claimed  It appears she was unaffected by M Day and just had different powers in the House Of M reality  or the only had those powers removed from the Decimation  View Below for further developments and clarifications on remaining mutants   edit  Confirmed remaining mutants While it has been stated that there are at least 198 remaining mutants  according to Henry Peter Gyrich in Avengers  The Initiative  there are actually  around 300   the 198 number is merely the number of mutants the US government has cataloged  with a 199th mutant  Mutant Zero  being off the record  7  Over 198 mutants have already been identified post M Day with over 30 of said mutants have died since the mutant Decimation hit  The canonically confirmed post M

was an undead cyborg  A TV news report in the NYX series mentions a female mutant artist from Wyoming who was killed in her apartment for being a mutant  It s possible the news anchor was not distinguishing between powered and depowered mutants  Notes  The six mutants of the Shadow X group all entered the Marvel 616 universe post Decimation  and thus were unaffected and retained their powers  All six are now dead  Obituary of O Force is mentioned as being a potential recruit for the Initiative  the implication is that he still maintains his mutant abilities  but this has not been made officially clear  The same is true for Neurotap  Threnody  Esperanza Ling  Crimson Daffodil  Timeslip  Firebolt  Base  Link and Poltergeist  and Michael Dorie the Mutant Shaman  All of the mutants from alternate timelines who entered the 616 universe pre Decimation are powered according to X Men  Endangered Species  This includes Bishop  Blaquesmith  Dark Beast  Gaia  Marvel Girl  Mountjoy  Nocturne  Sugar Man  Sunpyre  Major Victory and The Witness  deceased   It is unknown if Archer and Fixx retained their mutant abilities after M Day  or if they even currently are still operating in the 616 universe timeline  Nocturne has left Marvel 616  It appears  as she is no longer with Big Hero 6  Sunpyre has also returned to her dimension  Gaia and Mountjoy have not been seen or heard from since long before M Day  so it is possible they are no longer in 616 either  While still a mutant  Cable does not belong to that list as he was born on Earth 616 as the son of Madelyne Pryor and Scott Summers and only raised in an alternate timeline  All five Tao Yu brothers are confirmed as living as of Civil War  X Men  1  It s unclear if the Marauders who died during the Messiah Complex  i e  Blockbuster  Scrambler  Prism  will return  as technically they may still be cloned  The Gorgon was killed before M Day  and resurrected by The Hand post M Day  apparently negating him from any effects of the spell  X Man restructured himself post M Day  Toro was revitalized by Bucky Barnes wishing for his return to life on the Cosmic Cube post M Day  Psylocke s psyche was briefly placed back into her resurrected  original body  which had died before M Day  see Revanche   this body demonstrated active powers  but was destroyed in a confrontation with Dazzler  Psylocke s psyche was then transferred back to into her Asian body  It is uncertain if Paradigm was killed before or after M Day  all that is for certain is that he was a mutant when he died  Wallflower was never actually reanimated  Her body was used as a vessel to house a bio sentinel  which the X Men destroyed   edit  Necrosha Selene and her servant Eli Bard have used the Transmode Virus to reanimate the mutant Caliban so that he may track down and reanimate deceased mutants  to both form an army and an energy source for Selene   The reanimated army appeared in the  Necrosha  story arc  consisting of thousands of inhabitants of Genosha  as well a number of notable deceased mutants associated with the X Men  See the main Necrosha article to view the full list of those resurrected during the story arc  Main article  Necrosha Necrosha Notes  The majority of these mutants were used as a sacrifice for Selene to reach her godhood  and have since gone back to being deceased  Those who were not sacrificed likely perished with Selene and the energy she used to keep them alive  as was implied by Destiny at the end of the X Men  Legacy tie in  121  Tarot was reanimated mysteriously before M Day and implied to be alive and depowered afterward  During her return in  Necrosha  she claims to be dead like her fellow Hellions and exhibiting her mutant abilities  It is possible that Tarot was not actually depowered by M Day  nor was she actually  alive  again beforehand  King Bedlam had used his abilities to inexplicably bring her back  and it was unquestionably stated her life was linked to his powers  It can be assumed she was returned to death in the fallout of the  House of M  reality and with King Bedlam s depowerment  Unus and Feral are reanimated but should still be depowered as they were not mutants after M day  Feral had her feline appearance restored prior to her death  and Unus was temporarily repowered by the Terrigen Mists  resulting in his death  Cypher  using his power and assistance from Warlock and Magik  eradicated the techno organic virus  effectively resurrecting himself   Due to his nature  Proteus was able to separate himself from Destiny but was seemingly destroyed in a confrontation with Rogue and Magneto  Magneto doubts if the effects of dispersing Proteus  energy are permanent   edit  Mutants or not Those characters have all had the origin of their powers put in question at some point  Here is some clarification   edit  Mutants  confirmed Jamie Braddock gained his powers as a result of being tortured by Doctor Crocodile  this has been explained as releasing his latent mutant abilities  Madame Web  Deceased  has never actually been referred to as a mutant  but several canonical references has listed her as such  The Stepford Cuckoos  in the X Men  Phoenix   Warsong limited series  it was revealed that they were actually Weapon XIV of the Weapon Plus Project  With this information also came the revelation that the girls were clones of each other  and also genetic daughters of Emma Frost  They were harvested from 1000 of her ova  and they had 995 other mutant siblings  most of which were identical to them  some however deformed   Ultimately at the climax of the story all but the 3 of the original Cuckoos perished  Mulholland Black  Deceased  was said to be a depowered mutant in The Order  8  but her mutant powers reemerged after losing her artificially granted abilities  in a way that resembles Iceman s powerloss and return  the point as moot as she sacrificed her life as her power reemergence was happening  The original Cyber s body died long ago and only his spirit now exists  He is classified as a mutant because he currently lives in the body of the mutant Milo Gunderson  Shatterstar  inhabits the body of a mutant  Benjamin Russell  they are physically identical though the exact nature of their connection  whether they be twins  clones  or split personalities has yet to be revealed  was listed as a mutant in X Men  The 198 Files Stryfe is seen as powered in the near future of 616  He and Bishop then travel into the distant future which may or may not be alternative to 616  It is implied he will be the new host for Apocalypse  though what effect this will have on present 616 continuity is unclear  Franklin Richards and Cable had their abilities suppressed before M Day  but remains genetic mutants  Cable has since found a way to mimic his powers through technological means and Franklin has since recovered his powers  Living Monolith  though thought to be a mutate whose DNA was artificially spliced with the mutant genomes of Havok by Apocalypse s then servant Mister Sinister on his master s orders  was actually already a mutant with energy absorbing abilities   edit  Mutants  status unknown Irving and Doug  amp  Jerry have been shown as retaining their physical mutation but showed no sign of their former mutant abilities  Dark Mother  Presumed deceased   Timeslip  Puff Adder  Quiet Bill  Deceased   Orphan Maker  Nanny  Famine  Deceased  and Belladonna have all appeared on panel but did not demonstrate whether they still had their powers  The nine members of Clan Akkaba  Professor Xavier  Magneto and Quicksilver were all depowered  but have since regained their abilities through various methods  It is unclear what their official genetic status is  although they re all defined as mutants in successive stories  Darkstar was killed  The Russian government replaced her  multiple times  with woman imbued with her genetic material and her brioche  which is inexplicably linked to the dark dimension   The latest of these woman was over taken by a Dire Wraith  and then seemingly the original Laynia Petrovna then over came the Dire Wraith  It is unclear if this is Laynia Petrovna  or if that is even possible  or if Laynia Petrovna s DNA is the template form of the Dire Wraith   edit  Mutants  depowered Brass  El Aguila and Razorback  The Civil War  Battle Damage Report made no mention of if any mutant referenced remained powered  although several were listed as potential recruits for The Initiative  All are well trained to fight crime without mutant powers  El Aguila was confirmed depowered in the entry for The Collective in volume 2 of the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe hardcovers  Razorback s entry in Volume 9 confirms he s depowered  while Brass  entry in Volume 14 also lists him as depowered  Artie Maddicks  like Marrow  is a  REM   someone who has remnant physical mutation  Harpoon was confirmed depowered in New Avengers  18  but has since reappeared as a member of the Marauders  It is confirmed in X Men  205 that he is using a technological weapon as Storm is seen using it  Black Tom Cassidy was using Black Air technology to mimic his powers in New Excalibur Gazer  Deceased   Wild Child  Deceased   Sunfire and Polaris were all depowered  but were repowered permanently through technological means  Feral  Deceased  and Thornn were not actually repowered  they merely had their physical mutations restored  but not their X gene  as shown in Wolverine  55   edit  Non mutants Cloak  amp  Dagger are listed as science magic based mutates in Civil War  Battle Damage Report   Though they have otherwise long been established in the main Marvel continuity as latent mutants whose powers were activated by drugs developed by the demon D Spayre  this appears to now have been retconned  When they joined the Dark X Men  a mutant group  it was assumed Norman Osborn recruited them for their mutant status  however the partners and Osborn both affirm they are not mutants  and that they are joining the team for appearances  Later  Doctor Nemesis confirmed that were not genetic mutants  and both of them left the team to be on their own again  Chimera is an extradimensional mutate as revealed in Steve Rogers   X Men Files   Deadpool got his powers from the Weapon X program  All of Darkstar s replacements are women who have become mutates by infusing Laynia Petrovna s DNA with their own  and given access to the darkforce by use of Laynia s amulet which is inexplicably linked to the Dark Dimension  Juggernaut got his powers from the mystical Gem of Cyttorak  Spiral s superhuman abilities are the product of extradimensional magic  bio engineering  and cybernetics  Lady Deathstrike is a cybernetically enhanced human  Longshot is a synthezoid from the Mojoverse  Mastermind Excello is simply one of the eight smartest men  Mister Sinister was initially transformed into the servant of Apocalypse using Celestial technology  and he later experimented on himself for further mutation  Vertigo is a Savage Land mutate  Mimic  thought to be a possible latent mutant  Marvel s  Steve Rogers  Villain Files  designates him as Mutate  The Owl  has been called both a mutant and mutate  He has genetically manipulated himself so many times  as well as augmented his abilities using equipment it is difficult to determine if any of his abilities are innate or not  Previously he was long assumed to be an animal spliced mutate  like many other Marvel characters such as Spider Man and Spider Woman   He was producing the drug MGH  the Daredevil story arc which reintroduced him stated him as mutant  from his own genetic material  however there have been mutates who have also managed to so do so as well  In Steve Rogers  Villain Files  he is designated as Mutate  The Purple Man had long been assumed to be a human mutate  but has referred to himself on occasion as a human mutant  It is possible he is a latent mutant  whose powers were triggered during the chemical accident in his origin story  just like Mimic  but this has yet to be officially confirmed  In Steve Rogers  Villain Files  he is designated as Mutate  The Folding Circle Sauron gained his powers when bitten by a pterodactyl  Andreas Strucker and Andrea Strucker  both deceased  got their powers injected  in vitro  as fetuses during gestation  As such  they were mutates  not genetic mutants  Daisy Johnson a k a  Quake is the daughter of the super criminal mutate known as Mr  Hyde  Her power  though genetically derived  are not the result of genetic mutation  Yo Yo Rodriguez a k a  Slingshot is the daughter of the super criminal mutate known as the Griffin  The original members of Psionex are not mutants  but genetically modified human mutates Cassandra Nova  as Professor Xavier s dark twin  belongs to the Mummudrai species  Agent Brand is confirmed to be a human alien hybrid  Ink has been confirmed as not being a mutant  but gained his abilities from his tattoo artist  who is a mutant  Moses Magnum has reappeared in Dark Wolverine  78  In this issue he is directly stated to be a mutant  a fact that he does not dispute when mentioned in his presence  Previously however  Moses Magnum s history showed his powers were bestowed upon him by Apocalypse  though it is possible that they could merely have been either awakened and or enhanced by Apocalypse  who has done similar things to his followers  This sudden designation of Moses Magnum as a mutant appears to either be a continuity error or a direct retcon  However in Marvel s  Steve Rogers  Villain Files   he is designated at Mutate  Fantomex was stated to be a mutant  by both himself and the X editors  in Uncanny X Men and Uncanny X Force  However his origin story originally stated that he is a human mutate cyborg created by the Weapon Plus program  Steve Rogers   X Men Files  designate him as a cyborg mutate  edit  Extraterrestrial mutants Ultra Girl is a Kree mutant  Ariel is an extraterrestrial mutant who identifies herself with the human mutant community  Broo is considered to be a mutant among the Brood race as he is able to feel compassion and is highly intelligent   edit  Species undetermined The Shadow King was either an astral plane creature  or the remnant incorporeal essence of a telepathic mutant  Whether the powerful mutant telepath   Amahl Farouk   was the actual identity or simply a hosting avatar of the Shadow King is unknown  Ernst  in the Here Comes Tomorrow storyline  was implied to be Cassandra Nova  reeducated and transformed into Ernst  Despite later retcons  this has not yet been conclusively disproven  As such  her status is unknown  Layla Miller has both confirmed and denied she is a mutant  Damian Tryp has claimed to really be of a race of proto mutants he calls changelings  who stand apart for having superhuman attributes apparent at birth  He is either lying or something else entirely  He also claimed that Multiple Man is of the same species  Asp only feared the Superhuman Registration Act  not the Mutant Registration act  No source has been given to her powers  Boulder  Geldoff   Proton  Deceased   Sunstreak  Eden Fesi and some of the secondary Secret Warriors  NYX sniper  Raptor  the unnamed tattooed Russian mobster tied to Colossus  past  among many others  have all had no source given to their powers Members of the 6th Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club Claudine Renko   Miss Sinister Red Queen   Madelyne Pryor was described  only in an interview with the scripter of Uncanny X Men at the time 122   to have been something else and even  someone else   supposedly not Pryor  entirely  However  neither has been confirmed in comics as of yet  Speed  and Wiccan might be reincarnated children from the Scarlet Witch and as such mutants or mystical creatures created by Mephisto  or not  They both seem to think they are mutants  Hollow  It is unknown what it exactly is  Originally explained a prisoner of Emplate  the creature was retconned into being M imprisoned by Emplate who attacked her and created the Penance shell around her  M was freed from the Penance shell  and the St  Croix twins went inside it  becoming Penance  in order to make up the wrong that was done to their sister  When they later were freed from the Penance shell  it was discovered that the shell was autonomous  It remains to be seen whether Hollow is a living creature  some mystic device  a magical creation  etc  More recent rhetoric by Emplate has implied that the being may in fact be some sort of mutant  but Emplate only refers to  Penance  as a mutant  The relationship between the Penance identity and shell is still very unclear  Shriek has conflicting power sources  Cloud 9  no source has been given for her powers  but she has been confirmed to not be a mutant  The Isolationist has been described as not being a mutant  but something else entirely  123  The Profile had been confirmed by his creator as not being a mutant but a     brilliant on the spot psychologist who can profile anyone he looks at      However  in the Heroic Age  Villains special  he was implied to perhaps be a mutant with the ability     to see anyone s needs  wants  and desires      His true status has yet to be confirmed at this time  Romulus is originally said to be the leader of the Lupine  a human looking species who  through convergent evolution  would have evolved from canines instead of primates  He is said to have been heavily invested in the lives of various feral mutants  most notably Sabretooth and Wolverine   Despite sharing many physical characteristics and abilities with the feral mutants  he has never been confirmed to be a mutant himself   edit  Homo mermanus vs Homo sapiens superior One of the reasons Namor and Namora were not officially recognized as mutants for so long was due to the hybrid nature of their powers  As Atlanteans they are far more powerful than the average  human  they stand capable of swimming speeds up to 30 miles per hour  48 km h   breathe perfectly underwater  and as hybrids breathe air as well   have a life span of approximately 150 years  and are far more physically durable and stronger than the average human  as a side effect of living in such a high pressure environment  Even as hybrids Namor  Namora and Namorita have powers beyond those of either Homo sapiens sapiens or Homo mermanus  There are several other Human Atlantean hybrids in marvel history including Llyra  Llyron and Nia Noble  All of confirmed hybrids seem to also classify as Homo sapiens superior  whether this is always the case of mixing genes  or just a fluke that all hybrids introduced developed powers beyond the normal ones exhibited by either races is unclear and further complicates identifying Atlantean mutants   It is unclear what the  mutant  status of hybrid individuals is post M Day  Llyra possesses normal Atleantean traits as well as shape changing abilities  Was magical transformed into a sea hag by the god Set before M Day  Llyron  like Namor  possesses enhanced strength and flight through reptilian foot wings  His whereabouts are unknown  Nia Noble possesses normal Atlantean traits as well as telepathy  Her mother  was a human telepath who gained her abilities through mystic learning  Nia s inherited telepathy seems to be innate  though its possible it is also learned  making her not a mutant at all   There have been four confirmed purebred Atlantean mutants and one possible purebred Atlantean mutant  Tyrak has the ability to augment his physical size  Though his abilities appear innate  he could possibly using mystic or technological means to achieve this  however no evidence has ever been given for this  Crosta  a young Atlantean who developed a physical mutation and shockwave abilities during puberty  was sent to the X Men by Namor to be taught how to be a mutant and control his powers  Eel  Sharkskin  and Undertow are mutant Atlanteans from the Maritania settlement who were born mutated as a result of human nuclear tests in the region  Outcasts from their own people  they formed SURF  124  It is unclear whether Llyra  Llyron  and Nia Noble still have their mutant abilities  and whether Atlantean mutants count toward the global mutant population or not   edit  Consequences  repercussions The Xavier Institute is no longer just a school for mutants  but a haven for all remaining mutants  This changed after the Civil War as they were all set free by the US president  Sentinel Squad O N E  In the aftermath of the House of M  resulting in the depowering of 90  of the world s mutant population  the Office of National Emergency  aka O N E   a splinter from the Department of Homeland Security  had Sentinels instituted at the X Mansion to protect the mutants in case any enemies used this low point as an opportunity to attack them at their weakest  and also to stop the mutants in the event of a revolution  The Squad was later destroyed in the events of Messiah Complex  Children of the Vault  The reduction of mutants also accidentally awakens The Children of the Vault   In the pages of X Men  Exodus reforms the Acolytes with Frenzy  Random  Tempo and Carmella Unuscione Apocalypse  Due to the events of M Day  Apocalypse was revived by Cable to force the remaining mutants to band together to expel the threat  as a way to bring the mutant community together after M Day   In the pages of X Men and Cable and Deadpool  He turned Sunfire  Gambit  Polaris and Gazer into his Horsemen  Gazer was killed by Ozymandias  however  resulting in Polaris and Sunfire regaining powers and Gambit being turned black and having a lethal gas power  The latter two then joined Sinister s forces as did Exodus s forces after discovering that no new mutant had appeared since M Day  The flying energy  It reawakened Vulcan who was a member of a secret team of X Men sent to help Scott s team on Krakoa and left to die there  He returned from his space exile to begin a vendetta against Xavier and then the Shi ar Empire  In the pages of Deadly Genesis and Uncanny X Men   The rest of the energy ended up forming The Collective by merging with a mutant postal worker  Michael Pointer who then apparently killed the then members of Alpha Flight and went on to Genosha  repowering Magneto  who recognizes the intelligence controlling it as  Xorn who explains his action by the fact that the mutants needed him as a leader  The New Avengers arrive and blast the Collective into the sun  Magneto is then taken away in an helicopter which blows up right after it takes off  In the pages of New Avengers  William Stryker  Deeming the sudden massive reduction in number of the mutant population a sign of God  saying  He made the first step and now we have to take the next   basically rallying for genocide on TV   In the pages of New X Men  Onslaught  Onslaught Reborn saw Onslaught return  as the mutant energies of both Professor X and Magneto meet once again  they reform the monster   This takes place before the Civil War event   Both Professor X and Reaper have been healed by the event  The former can now walk again and the latter is no longer brain dead  Although Professor Xavier is one of the depowered  his telepathy is later restored and enhanced to a more powerful level when Vulcan throws him into the M Kraan Crystal  After the Civil War  X Factor Investigations will be dealing with a siege in Mutant Town when a group of depowered mutants  calling themselves X Cell become terrorists thinking the Government is responsible for their depowerment  The members are Elijah Cross  Callisto  Blob  Marrow  Fatale  Reaper  and Abyss  Wolverine discovers a half way home for depowered mutants who are fearing for their lives  Both Jubilee and Maverick are there  Dr  Kavita Rao s work is ruined  as there s no more need for a mutant cure and all of her mutant DNA samples were turned to dust on M Day  As a side effect  no new mutants are born  This leads into the  Endangered Species  storyline  and later  the  Messiah Complex   that deals with the birth of Hope Summers  the only new mutant born since the Decimation  Messiah War and the  Second Coming  storyline  in which Cerebra detects the activation of the X Gene in five as yet unknown individuals  leading into the upcoming  The Five Lights  storyline in Uncanny X Men  Several de powered mutants seek to return to heroing  and are recruited into the post Civil War New Warriors  Quicksilver ends up in the care of the Inhumans where he starts the Silent War by stealing the crystals of the Terrigen Mists  He then attempts to repower mutants  resulting in many of their injuries and some deaths  See  Son of M  Several characters returned from the dead  including Magik  Legion  and Hawkeye  The Russian black ops group  the Red Room  had lost all their mutant operatives  powers  resulting in them being ordered to patriotically kill themselves  This made the Red Room suspicious as to why their operatives lost their powers and the X Men were left unscathed  leading them to think that the latter was somewhat responsible and captured Colossus  Wolverine and Nightcrawler for interrogation   edit  Collected editions  edit  Trade paperbacks Title ISBN
