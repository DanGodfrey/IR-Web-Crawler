Headquarters Building  NHB  of the George Bush Center for Intelligence  The Central Intelligence Agency  CIA  is a civilian intelligence agency of the United States government  It is an executive agency and reports directly to the Director of National Intelligence  with responsibility for providing national security intelligence assessment to senior United States policymakers  Intelligence gathering is performed by non military commissioned civilian intelligence agents  many of whom are trained to avoid tactical situations  The CIA also oversees and sometimes engages in tactical and covert activities at the request of the President of the United States  9  Often  when such field operations are organized  the US military or other warfare tacticians carry these tactical operations out on behalf of the agency while the CIA oversees them  10  Although intelligence gathering is the agency s main agenda  tactical divisions were established in the agency to carry out emergency field operations that require immediate suppression or dismantling of a threat or weapon  11  The CIA is often used for intelligence gathering instead of the U S military to avoid a declaration of war  The CIA succeeded the Office of Strategic Services  OSS   formed during World War II to coordinate espionage activities against the Axis Powers for the branches of the United States Armed Forces  The National Security Act of 1947 established the CIA  affording it  no police or law enforcement functions  either at home or abroad   12  13  Through interagency cooperation  the CIA has Cooperative Security Locations at its disposal  These locations are called  lily pads  by the Air Force  14  15  The primary function of the CIA is to collect information about foreign governments  corporations  and individuals  and to advise public policymakers  but it does conduct emergency tactical operations  carries out covert operations  16  17  and exerts foreign political influence through its tactical divisions  such as the Special Activities Division  18  19  The CIA and its responsibilities changed markedly in 2004  Before December 2004  the CIA was the main intelligence organization of the US government  it was responsible for coordinating the activities of the US Intelligence Community  IC  as a whole  The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 created the office of the Director of National Intelligence  DNI   which took over management and leadership of the IC  Today  the CIA still has a number of functions in common with other countries  intelligence agencies 20  21  22  23   see Relationships with foreign intelligence agencies   The CIA s headquarters is in Langley in McLean  unincorporated Fairfax County  Virginia  24  a few miles west of Washington  D C  along the Potomac River  Sometimes  the CIA is referred to euphemistically in government and military parlance as Other Government Agencies  OGA   particularly when its operations in a particular area are an open secret  25  26  Other terms include The Company  27  28  29  30 Langley and The Agency  Contents 1 Organization 1 1 Budget 1 2 Executive Office 1 3 Executive staff 1 3 1

Further reading 13 External links 13 1 Other links Organization Main article  Organizational structure of the Central Intelligence Agency The CIA has an executive office and several agency wide functions  and four major directorates  The Directorate of Intelligence  responsible for all source intelligence research and analysis The National Clandestine Service  formerly the Directorate of Operations  which does clandestine intelligence collection and covert action The Directorate of Support The Directorate of Science and Technology Budget The overall US intelligence budget has been considered classified until recently  There have been numerous attempts to obtain general information about the budget  31  As a result  it was revealed that CIA s annual budget in Fiscal Year 1963 was US  550 million  inflation adjusted US  4 2 billion in 2012   32  and the overall intelligence budget in FY 1997 was US  26 6 billion  inflation adjusted US  38 5 billion in 2012   33  There have also been accidental disclosures  for instance  Mary Margaret Graham  a former CIA official and deputy director of national intelligence for collection in 2005  said that the annual intelligence budget was  44 billion  34  In Legacy of Ashes The History of the CIA  Tim Weiner claims that early funding was solicited by James Forrestal and Allen Dulles from private Wall Street and Washington DC sources  Next Forrestal convinced  an old chum   John W  Snyder  the US Secretary of the Treasury and one of Truman s closest allies  to allow the use of the  200 million Exchange Stabilization Fund by CIA fronts to influence European elections  beginning with Italy 35  After the Marshall Plan was approved  appropriating  13 7 billion over five years  5  of those funds or  685 million were made available to the CIA  36  Executive Office The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency  DCIA  reports directly to the Director of National Intelligence  DNI   in practice  he deals with the DNI  Congress  usually via the Office of Congressional Affairs   and the White House  while the Deputy Director is the internal executive  The CIA has varying amounts of Congressional oversight  although that is principally a guidance role  The Executive Office also facilitates the CIA s support of the US military by providing it with information it gathers  receiving information from military intelligence organizations  and cooperating on field activities  Two senior executives have responsibility  one CIA wide and one for the National Clandestine Service  The Associate Director for Military Support  a senior military officer  manages the relationship between the CIA and the Unified Combatant Commands  who produce regional operational intelligence and consume national intelligence  he is assisted by the Office of Military Affairs in providing support to all branches of the military  37  In the National Clandestine Services  an Associate Deputy Director for Operations for Military Affairs 38  deals with specific clandestine human source intelligence and covert action in support of military operations  The CIA also makes national level intelligence available to tactical organizations  usually to their all source intelligence group  39  Executive staff Staff offices with several general responsibilities report to the Executive Office  The staff also gather information and then report such information to the Executive Office  General publications The CIA s Center for the Study of Intelligence maintains the Agency s historical materials and promotes the study of intelligence as a legitimate discipline  40  In 2002  the CIA s School for Intelligence Analysis began publishing the unclassified Kent Center Occasional Papers  aiming to offer  an opportunity for intelligence professionals and interested colleagues in an unofficial and unfettered vehicle to debate and advance the theory and practice of intelligence analysis   41  General Counsel and Inspector General Two offices advise the Director on legality and proper operations  The Office of General Counsel advises the Director of the CIA on all legal matters relating to his role as CIA director and is the principal source of legal counsel for the CIA  The Office of Inspector General promotes efficiency  effectiveness  and accountability in the administration of Agency activities  and seeks to prevent and detect fraud  waste  abuse  and mismanagement  The Inspector General  whose activities are independent of those of any other component in the Agency  reports directly to the Director of the CIA  42  43  Influencing public opinion See also  CIA influence on public opinion The Office of Public Affairs advises the Director of the CIA on all media  public policy  and employee communications issues relating to this person s role  This office  among other functions  works with the entertainment industry  44  Directorate of Intelligence The Directorate of Intelligence produces all source intelligence analysis on key foreign issues  45  It has four regional analytic groups  six groups for transnational issues  and two support units  46  Regional groups There is an Office dedicated to Iraq  and regional analytical Offices covering  The Office of Middle East and North Africa Analysis  MENA  The Office of South Asia Analysis  OSA  The Office of Russian and European Analysis  OREA  The Office of Asian Pacific  Latin American and African Analysis  APLAA  Transnational groups The Office of Terrorism Analysis 47  supports the National Counterterrorism Center in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence  See CIA transnational anti terrorism activities  48  The Office of Transnational Issues 49  assesses perceived existing and emerging threats to US national security and provides the most senior policymakers  military planners  and law enforcement with analysis  warning  and crisis support  The CIA Crime and Narcotics Center 50  researches information on international crime for policymakers and the law enforcement community  As the CIA has no legal domestic police authority  it usually sends its analyses to the FBI and other law enforcement organizations  such as the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  and Firearms  The Weapons Intelligence  Nonproliferation  and Arms Control Center 51  provides intelligence support related to national and non national threats  as well as supporting threat reduction and arms control  It receives the output of national technical means of verification  The Counterintelligence Center Analysis Group 52  identifies  monitors  and analyzes the efforts of foreign intelligence entities  both national and non national  against US government interests  It works with FBI personnel in the National Counterintelligence Executive of the Director of National Intelligence  The Information Operations Center Analysis Group  53  deals with threats to US computer systems  This unit supports DNI activities  Support and general units The Office of Collection Strategies and Analysis provides comprehensive intelligence collection expertise to the Directorate of Intelligence  to senior Agency and Intelligence Community officials  and to key national policymakers  The Office of Policy Support customizes Directorate of Intelligence analysis and presents it to a wide variety of policy  law enforcement  military  and foreign liaison recipients  National Clandestine Service Main article  National Clandestine Service The National Clandestine Service  NCS  formerly the Directorate of Operations  is responsible for collecting foreign intelligence  mainly from clandestine HUMINT sources  and covert action  The new name reflects its having absorbed some Department of Defense HUMINT assets  The NCS was created in an attempt to end years of rivalry over influence  philosophy and budget between the United States Department of Defense and the CIA  The Department of Defense had organized the Defense HUMINT Service  54  under the Defense Intelligence Agency which  with the Presidential decision  became part of the NCS  The precise present organization of the NCS is classified  55  Directorate of Science and Technology Main article  Directorate of Science  amp  Technology The Directorate of Science  amp  Technology was established to research  create  and manage technical collection disciplines and equipment  Many of its innovations were transferred to other intelligence organizations  or  as they became more overt  to the military services  For example  the development of the U 2 high altitude reconnaissance aircraft was done in cooperation with the United States Air Force  The U 2 s original mission was clandestine imagery intelligence over denied areas such as the Soviet Union  56  It was subsequently provided with signals intelligence and measurement and signature intelligence capabilities  and is now operated by the Air Force  Imagery intelligence collected by the U 2 and reconnaissance satellites was analyzed by a DS amp T organization called the National Photointerpretation Center  NPIC   which had analysts from both the CIA and the military services  Subsequently  NPIC was transferred to the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency  NGA   The CIA has always shown a strong interest in how to use advances in technology to enhance its effectiveness  This interest has historically had two primary goals  harnessing techniques for its own use countering any new intelligence technologies the Soviets might develop  57  In 1999  the CIA created the venture capital firm In Q Tel to help fund and develop technologies of interest to the agency  58  It has long been the IC practice to contract for major development  such as reconnaissance aircraft and satellites  Directorate of Support Main articles  Organizational structure of the Central Intelligence Agency Directorate of Support and Directorate of Support The Directorate of Support has organizational and administrative functions to significant units including  The Office of Security The Office of Communications The Office of Information Technology Training The Office of Training begins with the Junior Officer Training program for new employees before going on to conducting courses in a wide range of specialized professional disciplines  So that the initial course might be taken by employees who had not received final security clearance and thus were not permitted unescorted access to the Headquarters building  a good deal of basic training has been given at office buildings in the urban areas of Arlington  Virginia  For a later stage of training of student operations officers  there is at least one classified training area at Camp Peary  near Williamsburg  Virginia  Students are selected  and their progress evaluated  in ways derived from the OSS  published as the book Assessment of Men  Selection of Personnel for the Office of Strategic Services 59  Relationship with other sources of intelligence The CIA acts as the primary US HUMINT  HUMan INTelligence  and general analytic agency  under the Director of National Intelligence  who directs or coordinates the 16 member organizations of the United States intelligence community  In addition  it obtains information from other US government intelligence agencies  commercial information sources  and foreign intelligence services  Other US intelligence agencies A number of intelligence organizations are fully or partially under the budgetary control of the United States Secretary of Defense or other cabinet officers such as the United States Attorney General  As do other analytic members of the US intelligence community  such as the Department of State s Bureau of Intelligence and Research and the analytic division of the Defense Intelligence Agency  DIA   the CIA s raw input includes imagery intelligence  IMINT  collected by the air and space systems of the National Reconnaissance Office  NRO   processed by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency  NGA   signals intelligence  SIGINT  of the National Security Agency  NSA   and measurement and signature intelligence  MASINT  from the DIA MASINT center  Open Source Intelligence Until the 2004 reorganization of the intelligence community  one of the  services of common concern  that the CIA provided was Open Source Intelligence from the Foreign Broadcast Information Service  FBIS   60  FBIS  which had absorbed the Joint Publication Research Service  a military organization that translated documents  61  which moved into the National Open Source Enterprise under the Director of National Intelligence  The CIA still provides a variety of unclassified maps and reference documents both to the intelligence community and the public  62  During the Reagan administration  Michael Sekora  assigned to the DIA   worked with agencies across the intelligence community  including the CIA  to develop and deploy a technology based competitive strategy system called Project Socrates  Project Socrates was designed to utilize open source intelligence gathering almost exclusively  The technology focused Socrates system supported such programs as the Strategic Defense Initiative in addition to private sector projects   63   64  As part of its mandate to gather intelligence  the CIA is looking increasingly online for information  and has become a major consumer of social media   We re looking at YouTube  which carries some unique and honest to goodness intelligence   said Doug Naquin  director of the DNI Open Source Center  OSC  at CIA headquarters   We re looking at chat rooms and things that didn t exist five years ago  and trying to stay ahead   65  Outsourcing See also  Intelligence Outsourcing Many of the duties and functions of Intelligence Community activities  not the CIA alone  are being outsourced and privatized  Mike McConnell  former Director of National Intelligence  was about to publicize an investigation report of outsourcing by US intelligence agencies  as required by Congress  66  However  this report was then classified  67  68  Hillhouse speculates that this report includes requirements for the CIA to report  67  69  different standards for government employees and contractors  contractors providing similar services to government workers  analysis of costs of contractors vs  employees  an assessment of the appropriateness of outsourced activities  an estimate of the number of contracts and contractors  comparison of compensation for contractors and government employees  attrition analysis of government employees  descriptions of positions to be converted back to the employee model  an evaluation of accountability mechanisms  an evaluation of procedures for  conducting oversight of contractors to ensure identification and prosecution of criminal violations  financial waste  fraud  or other abuses committed by contractors or contract personnel   and an  identification of best practices of accountability mechanisms within service contracts   According to investigative journalist Tim Shorrock     what we have today with the intelligence business is something far more systemic  senior officials leaving their national security and counterterrorism jobs for positions where they are basically doing the same jobs they once held at the CIA  the NSA and other agencies   but for double or triple the salary  and for profit  It s a privatization of the highest order  in which our collective memory and experience in intelligence   our crown jewels of spying  so to speak   are owned by corporate America  Yet  there is essentially no government oversight of this private sector at the heart of our intelligence empire  And the lines between public and private have become so blurred as to be nonexistent  70  71  Congress has required an outsourcing report by March 30  2008  69  The Director of National Intelligence has been granted the authority to increase the number of positions  FTEs  on elements in the Intelligence Community by up to 10  should there be a determination that activities performed by a contractor should be done by a US government employee   69  Part of the contracting problem comes from Congressional restrictions on the number of employees in the IC  According to Hillhouse  this resulted in 70  of the de facto workforce of the CIA s National Clandestine Service being made up of contractors   After years of contributing to the increasing reliance upon contractors  Congress is now providing a framework for the conversion of contractors into federal government employees more or less   69  As with most government agencies  building equipment often is contracted  The National Reconnaissance Office  NRO   responsible for the development and operation of airborne and spaceborne sensors  long was a joint operation of the CIA and the United States Department of Defense  NRO had been significantly involved in the design of such sensors  but the NRO  then under DCI authority  contracted more of the design that had been their tradition  and to a contractor without extensive reconnaissance experience  Boeing  The next generation satellite Future Imagery Architecture project  how does heaven look   which missed objectives after  4 billion in cost overruns  was the result of this contract  72  73  Some of the cost problems associated with intelligence come from one agency  or even a group within an agency  not accepting the compartmented security practices for individual projects  requiring expensive duplication  74  Foreign intelligence services Many intelligence services cooperate  There may even be a deniable communications channel with ostensibly hostile nations  The role and functions of the CIA are roughly equivalent to those of the United Kingdom s Secret Intelligence Service  the SIS or MI6   the Canadian Security Intelligence Service  CSIS   the Australian Secret Intelligence Service  ASIS   the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service  Sluzhba Vneshney Razvedki   SVR   the Indian Research and Analysis Wing  RAW   the Pakistani Inter Services Intelligence  ISI   the French foreign intelligence service Direction G n rale de la S curit  Ext rieure  DGSE  and Israel s Mossad  While the preceding agencies both collect and analyze information  some like the US State Department s Bureau of Intelligence and Research are purely analytical agencies  The closest links of the US IC to other foreign intelligence agencies are to Anglophone countries  Australia  Canada  New Zealand  and the United Kingdom  There is a special communications marking that signals that intelligence related messages can be shared with these four countries  75  An indication of the United States  close operational cooperation is the creation of a new message distribution label within the main US military communications network  Previously  the marking of NOFORN  i e   No Foreign Nationals  required the originator to specify which  if any  non US countries could receive the information  A new handling caveat  USA AUS CAN GBR NZL Eyes Only  used primarily on intelligence messages  gives an easier way to indicate that the material can be shared with Australia  Canada  United Kingdom  and New Zealand  Organizational history See also  Director of Central Intelligence and Clandestine HUMINT and Covert Action The Central Intelligence Agency was created by Congress with the passage of the National Security Act of 1947  signed into law by President Harry S  Truman  It is the descendant of the Office of Strategic Services  OSS  of World War II  which was dissolved in October 1945 and its functions transferred to the State and War Departments  Eleven months earlier  in 1944  William J  Donovan  the OSS s creator  proposed to President Franklin D  Roosevelt to create a new organization directly supervised by the President   which will procure intelligence both by overt and covert methods and will at the same time provide intelligence guidance  determine national intelligence objectives  and correlate the intelligence material collected by all government agencies   76  Under his plan  a powerful  centralized civilian agency would have coordinated all the intelligence services  He also proposed that this agency have authority to conduct  subversive operations abroad   but  no police or law enforcement functions  either at home or abroad   77  dead link  The lives of 102 fallen CIA officers are represented by 102 stars on the CIA Memorial Wall in the Original Headquarters building  CIA personnel have died on duty  some in accidents and some by deliberate hostile action  On the memorial wall at CIA headquarters  some of the stars have no name attached  because it would reveal the identity of a clandestine officer  78  Both the OSS and its British counterparts  as do other agencies worldwide  struggle with finding the right organizational balance among clandestine intelligence collection  counterintelligence  and covert action  Immediate predecessors  1946 47 The Office of Strategic Services  which was the first independent US intelligence agency  created for World War II  was broken up shortly after the end of the war  by President Harry S  Truman  on September 20  1945 when he signed an Executive Order which made the breakup  official  as of October 1  1945  The rapid reorganizations that followed reflected the routine sort of bureaucratic competition for resources  but also trying to deal with the proper relationships of clandestine intelligence collection and covert action  i e   paramilitary and psychological operations

proposal presented by Jim Forrestal and Arthur Radford to the U S  Senate Military Affairs Committee at the end of 1945  79  Despite opposition from the military establishment  the United States Department of State and the Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI   76  President Truman established the Central Intelligence Group  CIG  in January 1946 which was the direct predecessor to the CIA  80  The CIG was an interim authority established under Presidential authority  The assets of the SSU  which now constituted a streamlined  nucleus  of clandestine intelligence was transferred to the CIG in mid 1946 and reconstituted as the Office of Special Operations  OSO   Early CIA  1947 1952 In September 1947  the National Security Act of 1947 established both the National Security Council and the Central Intelligence Agency  81  Rear Admiral Roscoe H  Hillenkoetter was appointed as the first Director of Central Intelligence  and one of the first secret operations under him was the successful support of the Christian Democrats in Italy  82  The 16 foot  5 m  diameter CIA seal in the lobby of the Original Headquarters Building  The National Security Council Directive on Office of Special Projects  June 18  1948  NSC 10 2  further gave the CIA the authority to carry out covert operations  against hostile foreign states or groups or in support of friendly foreign states or groups but which are so planned and conducted that any US Government responsibility for them is not evident to unauthorized persons   83  In 1949  the Central Intelligence Agency Act  Public law 81 110  authorized the agency to use confidential fiscal and administrative procedures  and exempting it from most of the usual limitations on the use of Federal funds  It also exempted the CIA from having to disclose its  organization  functions  officials  titles  salaries  or numbers of personnel employed   It also created the program  PL 110   to handle defectors and other  essential aliens  who fall outside normal immigration procedures  as well as giving those persons cover stories and economic support  84  The structure stabilizes  1952 Then DCI Walter Bedell Smith  who enjoyed a special degree of Presidential trust  having been Dwight D  Eisenhower s primary Chief of Staff during World War II  insisted that the CIA   or at least only one department   had to direct the OPC and OSO  Those organizations  as well as some minor functions  formed the euphemistically named Directorate of Plans in 1952  Also in 1952  United States Army Special Forces were created  with some missions overlapping those of the Department of Plans  In general  the pattern emerged that the CIA could borrow resources from Special Forces  although it had its own special operators  Early Cold War  1953 1966 Lockheed U 2  Dragon Lady   the first generation of near space reconnaissance aircraft Early CORONA KH 4B imagery IMINT satellite The USAF s SR 71 Blackbird was developed from the CIA s A 12 OXCART  Allen Dulles  who had been a key OSS operations officer in Switzerland during World War II  took over from Smith  at a time where US policy was dominated by intense anticommunism  Various sources existed  the most visible being the investigations and abuses of Senator Joseph McCarthy  and the more quiet but systematic containment doctrine developed by George Kennan  the Berlin Blockade and the Korean War  Dulles enjoyed a high degree of flexibility  as his brother  John Foster Dulles  was simultaneously Secretary of State  Concern regarding the Soviet Union and the difficulty of getting information from its closed society  which few agents could penetrate  led to solutions based on advanced technology  Among the first success was with the Lockheed U 2 aircraft  which could take pictures and collect electronic signals from an altitude thought to be above Soviet air defenses  reach  After Gary Powers was shot down by an SA 2 surface to air missile in 1960  causing an international incident  the SR 71 was developed to take over this role  During this period  there were numerous covert actions against nationalization of oil supplies and socialism  The CIA overthrew a democratically elected government for the first time during the 1953 Iranian coup d  tat  after Iran moved to take control of its petroleum reserves  Some of the largest operations were aimed at Cuba after the overthrow of the Batista dictatorship  including assassination attempts against Fidel Castro and the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion  There have been suggestions that the Soviet attempt to put missiles into Cuba came  indirectly  when they realized how badly they had been compromised by a US UK defector in place  Oleg Penkovsky  85  The CIA  working with the military  formed the joint National Reconnaissance Office  NRO  to operate reconnaissance aircraft such as the SR 71 and later satellites   The fact of  the United States operating reconnaissance satellites  like  the fact of  the existence of NRO  was highly classified for many years  Indochina and the Vietnam War  1954 1975  See also  Vietnam War and Phoenix Program The OSS Patti mission arrived in Vietnam near the end of World War II  and had significant interaction with the leaders of many Vietnamese factions  including Ho Chi Minh  86  While the Patti mission forwarded Ho s proposals for phased independence  with the French or even the United States as the transition partner  the US policy of containment opposed forming any government that was communist in nature  The first CIA mission to Indochina  under the code name Saigon Military Mission arrived in 1954  under Edward Lansdale  US based analysts were simultaneously trying to project the evolution of political power  both if the scheduled referendum chose merger of the North and South  or if the South  the US client  stayed independent  Initially  the US focus in Southeast Asia was on Laos  not Vietnam  During the period of US combat involvement in the Vietnam War  there was considerable argument about progress among the Department of Defense under Robert McNamara  the CIA  and  to some extent  the intelligence staff of Military Assistance Command Vietnam  87  In general  the military was consistently more optimistic than the CIA  Sam Adams  a junior CIA analyst with responsibilities for estimating the actual damage to the enemy  eventually resigned from the CIA  after expressing concern to Director of Central Intelligence Richard Helms with estimates that were changed for interagency and White House political reasons  Adams afterward wrote the book War of Numbers  Abuses of CIA authority  1970s 1990s Things came to a head in the mid 1970s  around the time of Watergate  A dominant feature of political life during that period were the attempts of Congress to assert oversight of the US Presidency and the executive branch of the US Government  Revelations about past CIA activities  such as assassinations and attempted assassinations of foreign leaders  most notably Fidel Castro and Rafael Trujillo  and illegal domestic spying on US citizens  provided the opportunities to execute Congressional oversight of US intelligence operations  88  Hastening the CIA s fall from grace were the burglary of the Watergate headquarters of the Democratic Party by ex CIA agents  and President Richard Nixon s subsequent attempt to use the CIA to impede the FBI s investigation of the burglary  In the famous  smoking gun  recording that led to President Nixon s resignation  Nixon ordered his chief of staff  H  R  Haldeman  to tell the CIA that further investigation of Watergate would  open the whole can of worms  about the Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba  89  In this way Nixon and Haldemann ensured that the CIA s  1 and  2 ranking officials  Richard Helms and Vernon Walters  communicated to FBI Director L  Patrick Gray that the FBI should not follow the money trail from the burglars to the Committee to Re elect the President  as it would uncover CIA informants in Mexico  The FBI initially agreed to this due to a long standing agreement between the FBI and CIA not to uncover each other s sources of information  Though within a couple of weeks the FBI demanded this request in writing  and when no such formal request came  the FBI resumed its investigation into the money trail  Nonetheless  when the smoking gun tapes were made public  damage to the public s perception of CIA s top officials  and thus to the CIA as a whole  could not be avoided  90  In 1973  then DCI James R  Schlesinger commissioned reports   known as the  Family Jewels    on illegal activities by the Agency  In December 1974  Investigative journalist Seymour Hersh broke the news of the  Family Jewels  in a front page article in The New York Times  claiming that the CIA had assassinated foreign leaders  and had illegally conducted surveillance on some 7 000 US citizens involved in the antiwar movement  Operation CHAOS   88  The CIA had also experimented on people  who unknowingly took LSD  among other things   88  Congress responded to the disturbing charges in 1975  investigating the CIA in the Senate via the Church Committee  chaired by Senator Frank Church  D Idaho   and in the House of Representatives via the Pike Committee  chaired by Congressman Otis Pike  D NY   88  In addition  President Gerald Ford created the Rockefeller Commission  88  and issued an executive order prohibiting the assassination of foreign leaders  During the investigation  Schlesinger s successor as DCI  William Colby  testified before Congress on 32 occasions in 1975  including about the  Family Jewels   91  Colby later stated that he believed that providing Congress with this information was the correct thing to do  and ultimately in the CIA s own interests  92  As the CIA fell out of favor with the public  Ford assured Americans that his administration was not involved   There are no people presently employed in the White House who have a relationship with the CIA of which I am personally unaware   88  Repercussions from the Iran Contra affair arms smuggling scandal included the creation of the Intelligence Authorization Act in 1991  It defined covert operations as secret missions in geopolitical areas where the US is neither openly nor apparently engaged  This also required an authorizing chain of command  including an official  presidential finding report and the informing of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees  which  in emergencies  requires only  timely notification   2004  DNI takes over CIA top level functions The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 created the office of the Director of National Intelligence  DNI   who took over some of the government and intelligence community  IC  wide functions that had previously been the CIA s  The DNI manages the United States Intelligence Community and in so doing it manages the intelligence cycle  Among the functions that moved to the DNI were the preparation of estimates reflecting the consolidated opinion of the 16 IC agencies  and preparation of briefings for the president  On July 30  2008  President Bush issued Executive Order 13470 93  amending Executive Order 12333 to strengthen the role of the DNI  94  Previously  the Director of Central Intelligence  DCI  oversaw the Intelligence Community  serving as the president s principal intelligence advisor  additionally serving as head of the CIA  The DCI s title now is  Director of the Central Intelligence Agency   DCIA   serving as head of the CIA  Currently  the CIA reports to the Director of National Intelligence  Prior to the establishment of the DNI  the CIA reported to the President  with informational briefings to congressional committees  The National Security Advisor is a permanent member of the National Security Council  responsible for briefing the President with pertinent information collected by all US intelligence agencies  including the National Security Agency  the Drug Enforcement Administration  etc  All 16 Intelligence Community agencies are under the authority of the Director of National Intelligence  Mission related issues and controversies The history of CIA deals with several things  certainly including covert action  but also clandestine and overt intelligence collection  intelligence analysis and reporting  and logistical and technical support of its activities  Prior to the December 2004 reorganization of the intelligence community  IC   it also was responsible for coordinations of IC wide intelligence estimates  These articles are organized in two different ways  By geographical region  for state actors or non state actors limited to a country or region  and by transnational topic  for non state actors   CIA operations by region  country and date are discussed in detail in the following articles  CIA activities in Africa CIA activities in Asia and the Pacific CIA activities in Russia and Europe CIA activities in the Americas CIA activities in the Near East  North Africa  South and Southwest Asia CIA analyses of issues such as the effect of emerging infectious diseases  and the detection of Weapons of mass destruction  are inherently transnational  and are discussed in the following articles  CIA operations and  where appropriate  authorizations for covert operations  for example  NSDD 138 authorizing direct action against opponents  by transnational topic are discussed in the following Wikipedia articles  CIA transnational activities in counterproliferation CIA transnational anti crime and anti drug activities CIA transnational anti terrorism activities CIA transnational health and economic activities CIA transnational human rights actions In addition  a view of covert US activity specifically oriented towards regime change actions is given in the following Wikipedia article  CIA sponsored regime change Major sources for this section include the Council on Foreign Relations of the United States series  the National Security Archive and George Washington University  the Freedom of Information Act Reading Room at the CIA  US Congressional hearings  Blum s book 95  and Weiner s book 96  Note that the CIA has responded to the claims made in Weiner s book  97  and that Jeffrey Richelson of the National Security Archive has also been critical of it  98  Areas of controversy about inappropriate  often illegal actions include experiments  without consent  on human beings to explore chemical means of eliciting information or disabling people  Another area involved torture and clandestine imprisonment  There have been attempted assassinations under CIA orders and support for assassinations of foreign leaders by citizens of the leader s country  and  in a somewhat different legal category that may fall under the customary laws of war  assassinations of militant leaders  Security and counterintelligence failures While the names change periodically  there are two basic security functions to protect the CIA and its operations  There is an Office of Security in the Directorate for Support  which is responsible for physical security of the CIA buildings  secure storage of information  and personnel security clearances  These are directed inwardly to the agency itself  In what is now the National Clandestine Service  there is a counter intelligence function  called the Counterintelligence Staff under its most controversial chief  James Jesus Angleton  This function has roles including looking for staff members that are providing information to foreign intelligence services  FIS  as moles  Another role is to check proposals for recruiting foreign HUMINT assets  to see if these people have any known ties to FIS and thus may be attempts to penetrate CIA to learn its personnel and practices  or as a provocateur  or other form of double agent  This agency component may also launch offensive counterespionage  where it attempts to interfere with FIS operations  CIA officers in the field often have assignments in offensive counterespionage as well as clandestine intelligence collection  Security failures The  Family Jewels  and other documents reveal that the Office of Security violated the prohibition of CIA involvement in domestic law enforcement  sometimes with the intention of assisting police organizations local to CIA buildings  On December 30  2009  a suicide attack occurred in the Forward Operating Base Chapman attack  a major CIA base in the province of Khost  Afghanistan  Seven CIA officers  including the chief of the base  were killed and six others seriously wounded in the attack  The CIA is consequently conducting an investigation into how the suicide bomber managed to avoid the base s security measures  99  Counterintelligence failures Perhaps the most disruptive period involving counterintelligence was James Jesus Angleton s search for a mole  100  based on the statements of a Soviet defector  Anatoliy Golitsyn  A second defector  Yuri Nosenko  challenged Golitsyn s claims  with the two calling one another Soviet double agents  101  Many CIA officers fell under career ending suspicion  the details of the relative truths and untruths from Nosenko and Golitsyn may never be released  or  in fact  may not be fully understood  The accusations also crossed the Atlantic to the British intelligence services  who also were damaged by molehunts  102  On February 24  1994  the agency was rocked by the arrest of 31 year veteran case officer Aldrich Ames on charges of spying for the Soviet Union since 1985  103  Other defectors have included Edward Lee Howard  David Henry Barnett  both field operations officers  and William Kampiles  a low level worker in the CIA 24 hour Operations Center  Kampiles sold the Soviets the detailed operational manual for the KH 11 reconnaissance satellite  104  Failures in intelligence analysis The agency has also been criticized by some for ineffectiveness as an intelligence gathering agency  Former DCI Richard Helms commented  after the end of the Cold War   The only remaining superpower doesn t have enough interest in what s going on in the world to organize and run an espionage service   105  The CIA has come under particular criticism for failing to predict the collapse of the Soviet Union  See the information technology section of the intelligence analysis management for discussion of possible failures to provide adequate automation support to analysts  and A Space for a IC wide program to collect some of them  Cognitive traps for intelligence analysis also goes into areas where CIA has examined why analysis can fail  Agency veterans  such as John McLaughlin  who was deputy director and acting director of central intelligence from October 2000 to September 2004 have lamented CIA s inability to produce the kind of long range strategic intelligence that it once did in order to guide policymakers  McLaughlin notes that CIA is drowned by demands from the White House and Pentagon for instant information  and said   intelligence analysts end up being the Wikipedia of Washington   106  In the intelligence analysis article  orienting oneself to the consumers deals with some of ways in which intelligence can become more responsive to the needs of policymakers  For the media  the failures are most newsworthy  A number of declassified National Intelligence Estimates do predict the behavior of various countries  but not in a manner attractive to news  or  most significantly  not public at the time of the event  In its operational role  some successes for the CIA include the U 2 and SR 71 programs  and anti Soviet operations in Afghanistan in the mid 1980s  Among the first analytic failures  before the CIA had its own collection capabilities  it assured President Harry S Truman on October 13  1950 that the Chinese would not send troops to Korea  Six days later  over one million Chinese troops arrived  107  See an analysis of the failure  also see surrounding text for the two Koreas and China  and the time period before the Korean War  Earlier  the intelligence community failed to detect the North Korean invasion  in part because resources were not allocated to SIGINT coverage of the Korean peninsula  The history of US intelligence  with respect to French Indochina and then the two Vietnams  is long and complex  The Pentagon Papers often contain pessimistic CIA analyses that conflicted with White House positions  It does appear that some estimates were changed to reflect Pentagon and White House views  87  See CIA activities in Asia and the Pacific for detailed discussions of intelligence and covert operations from 1945  i e   before the CIA  onwards  Another criticism is the failure to predict India s nuclear tests in 1974  A review of the various analyses of India s nuclear program did predict some aspects of the test  such as a 1965 report saying  correctly  that if India did develop a bomb  it would be explained as  for peaceful purposes   A major criticism is failure to forestall the September 11 attacks  The 9 11 Commission Report identifies failures in the IC as a whole  One problem  for example  was the FBI failing to  connect the dots  by sharing information among its decentralized field offices  The report  however  criticizes both CIA analysis  and impeding their investigation  The executive summary of a report which was released by the office of CIA Inspector General John Helgerson on August 21  2007 concluded that former DCI George Tenet failed to adequately prepare the agency to deal with the danger posed by Al Qaeda prior to the attacks of September 11  2001  The report had been completed in June 2005 and was partially released to the public in an agreement with Congress  over the objections of current DCI General Michael Hayden  Hayden said its publication would  consume time and attention revisiting ground that is already well plowed   108  Tenet disagreed with the report s conclusions  citing his planning efforts vis a vis al Qaeda  particularly from 1999  109  Criticism Controversy Main article  CIA transnational human rights actions See also  Project MKULTRA  Extraordinary rendition by the United States  Church Committee  Covert US regime change actions  and Targeted killing The CIA has been called into question on several occasions for some of the tactics it employs to carry out its missions  At times these tactics have included torture  funding and training of groups and organizations that would later participate in killing of civilians and other non combatants and would try or succeed in overthrowing democratically elected governments  human experimentation  and targeted killings and assassinations  In understanding the CIA s role in human rights  there are challenging problems of ethics  John Stockwell  a CIA officer who left the Agency and became a public critic  said of the CIA field officers   They don t meet the death squads on the streets where they re actually chopping up people or laying them down on the street and running trucks over their heads  The CIA people in San Salvador meet the police chiefs  and the people who run the death squads  and they do liaise with them  they meet them beside the swimming pool of the villas  And it s a sophisticated  civilized kind of relationship  And they talk about their children  who are going to school at UCLA or Harvard and other schools  and they don t talk about the horrors of what s being done  They pretend like it isn t true   110  The CIA has been criticized for ineffectiveness in its basic mission of intelligence gathering  A variant of this criticism is that allegations of misconduct are symptomatic of lack of attention to basic mission in the sense that controversial actions  such as assassination attempts and human rights violations  tend to be carried out in operations that have little to do with intelligence gathering  The CIA has been charged with having more than 90  of its employees living and working within the United States  rather than in foreign countries  which is in violation of its charter  The CIA has also been accused of a lack of financial and whistleblower controls which has led to waste and fraud  111  External investigations and document releases Main article  Official reports by the US Government on the CIA At various times since the creation of the CIA  the US Government has produced comprehensive reports on CIA actions that marked historical watersheds in how CIA went about trying to fulfill its vague charter purposes from 1947  These reports were the result of internal presidential studies  external investigations by Congressional committees or other arms of the US Government  or even the simple releases and declassification of large quantities of documents by the CIA  Several investigations  e g   the Church Committee  Rockefeller Commission  Pike Committee  etc    as well as released declassified documents  reveal that the CIA  at times  operated outside its charter  In some cases  such as during Watergate  this may have been due to inappropriate requests by White House staff  In other cases  there was a violation of Congressional intent  such as the Iran Contra affair  In many cases  these reports provide the only official discussion of these actions available to the public  Influencing public opinion and law enforcement See also  CIA influence on public opinion  CIA and the media  CIA in fiction and the movies  Robertson Panel  and Operation Mockingbird This is an area with many shades of gray  The CIA has much popular agreement in a set few instances wherein it has acted inappropriately  such as in providing technical support to White House operatives conducting both political and security investigations  with no reputed legal authority to do so  In many cases  ambiguity existing between law enforcement and intelligence agencies may expose a clandestine operation  This is a problem not unique to intelligence but also seen among different law enforcement organizations  where one wants to prosecute and another to continue investigations  perhaps reaching higher levels in a conspiracy  112  Al Qaeda and the War on Terror Further information  CIA transnational anti terrorism activities and CIA transnational human rights actions The CIA had long been dealing with terrorism originating from abroad  and in 1986 had set up a Counterterrorist Center to deal specifically with the problem  At first confronted with secular terrorism  the Agency found Islamist terrorism looming increasingly large on its scope  The network that became known as al Qaeda  The Base  grew out of Arab volunteers who fought the Soviets and their puppet regimes in Afghanistan in the 1980s  In 1984 Abdullah Azzam and Osama bin Laden set up an organization known as the Office of Services in Peshawar  Pakistan  to coordinate and finance the  Afghan Arabs   as the volunteers became known  The CIA also channeled US aid to Afghan resistance fighters via Pakistan in a covert operation known as Operation Cyclone  It denied dealing with non Afghan fighters  or having direct contact with bin Laden  113  However  various authorities relate that the Agency brought both Afghans and Arabs to the United States for military training  114  115  Azzam and Bin Laden set up recruitment offices in the US  under the name  Al Khifah   the hub of which was the Farouq Mosque in Brooklyn s Atlantic Avenue  This was  a place of pivotal importance for Operation Cyclone   116  Among notable figures at the Brooklyn center was the Egyptian  double agent  Ali Mohamed  who worked for the CIA  the Green Berets  Egyptian Islamic Jihad and al Qaeda at various times in the 1980s and 1990s  FBI special agent Jack Cloonan called him  bin Laden s first trainer   117  Another was  Blind Sheikh  Abdel Rahman  a leading recruiter of mujaheddin  who obtained US entry visas with the help of the CIA in 1987 and 1990  Around 1988  Bin Laden set up al Qaeda from the more extreme elements of the Services Office  But it was not a large organization  When Jamal al Fadl  who had been recruited through the Brooklyn center in the mid 1980s  joined in 1989  he was described as Qaeda s  third member   118  In January 1996 the CIA created an experimental  virtual station   the Bin Laden Issue Station  under the Counterterrorist Center  to track Bin Laden s developing activities  Al Fadl  who defected to the CIA in spring 1996  began to provide the Station with a new image of the Qaeda leader  he was not only a terrorist financier  but a terrorist organizer too  FBI special agent Dan Coleman  who together with his partner Jack Cloonan had been  seconded  to the Bin Laden Station  called him Qaeda s  Rosetta Stone   119  In 1999 CIA chief George Tenet launched a grand  Plan  to deal with al Qaeda  The Counterterrorist Center  its new chief Cofer Black and the center s Bin Laden unit were the Plan s developers and executors  Once it was prepared Tenet assigned CIA intelligence chief Charles E  Allen to set up a  Qaeda cell  to oversee its tactical execution  120  In 2000 the CIA and USAF jointly ran a series of flights over Afghanistan with a small remote controlled reconnaissance drone  the Predator  they obtained probable photos of Bin Laden  Cofer Black and others became advocates of arming the Predator with missiles to try to assassinate Bin Laden and other al Qaeda leaders  After the Cabinet level Principals Committee meeting on terrorism of September 4  2001  the CIA resumed reconnaissance flights  the drones now being weapons capable  The CIA set up a Strategic Assessments Branch in 2001 to remedy the deficit of  big picture  analysis of al Qaeda  and apparently to develop targeting strategies  The branch was formally set up in July 2001  but it struggled to find personnel  The branch s head took up his job on September 10  2001  121  122  123  After 9 11  the CIA came under criticism for not having done enough to prevent the attacks  Tenet rejected the criticism  citing the Agency s planning efforts especially over the preceding two years  He also considered that the CIA s efforts had put the Agency in a position to respond rapidly and effectively to the attacks  both in the  Afghan sanctuary  and in  ninety two countries around the world   124  The new strategy was called the  Worldwide Attack Matrix   Anwar al Aulaki  a Yemeni American U S  citizen and al Qaeda member  was killed on September 30  2011 by an air attack carried out by the Joint Special Operations Command  After several days of surveillance of Mr  Aulaki by the Central Intelligence Agency  armed drones took off from a new  secret American base in the Arabian Peninsula  crossed into northern Yemen and unleashed a barrage of Hellfire missiles at al Aulaki s vehicle  Samir Khan  a Pakistani American al Qaeda member and editor of the jihadist Inspire magazine  also reportedly died in the attack  The combined CIA JSOC drone strike was the first in Yemen since 2002   there have been others by the military s Special Operations forces   and was part of an effort by the spy agency to duplicate in Yemen the covert war which has been running in Afghanistan and Pakistan  125  126  Operation Neptune s Spear See also  Death of Osama bin Laden On May 1  2011  President Barack Obama announced that Osama bin Laden was killed earlier that day by  a small team of Americans  acting under his direct orders in Abbottabad  Pakistan  during a CIA operation  127  128  The raid was executed from a CIA forward base in Afghanistan by elements of the U S  Navy s Naval Special Warfare Development Group and CIA paramilitary operatives  129  It resulted in the acquisition of extensive intelligence on the future attack plans of al Qaeda  130  131  132  The operation was a result of years of intelligence work that included the CIA s capture and interrogation Khalid Sheik Mohammad  KSM  leading to the identity of a courier of Bin Laden s  133  134  135  the tracking of the courier to the compound by Special Activities Division paramilitary operatives and the establishing of a CIA safe house to provide critical tactical intelligence for the operation  136  137  138  Palestine Liberation Organization Between the 1970s and 1980s  the CIA forged a relationship with individual members of the Palestine Liberation Organization  The CIA secretly brought Hanan Ashrawi  Hanna Seniora  Saeb Erakat  and Sari Nusseibeh to the United States for intensive briefings on integrating their politics with the United States   139  Israeli intelligence did not know part of the PLO was being funded and trained by the CIA at the same time that the Agency was pretending to work with Israel against the PLO  According to agents involved in the operation   One of the PLO leaders argued that unless his fighters    were allowed to commit some actions against Israel  they would not be taken seriously  The CIA encouraged attacks on non civilian targets in Israel   John Loftus argues the CIA was doing  everything possible to destroy the Mossad s counter terrorist network   Loftus says  by the 1980s  oil company policy was CIA policy  Oil companies could bribe the PLO  but they could not bribe the Mossad   140  2003 War in Iraq Main article  CIA activities in Iraq Further information  Plame affair and CIA activities in the Near East  North Africa  South and Southwest Asia Whether or not the intelligence available  or presented by the Bush Administration justified the 2003 invasion of Iraq or allowed proper planning  especially for the occupation  is quite controversial  However  there were more than one CIA employee that asserted the sense that Bush administration officials placed undue pressure on CIA analysts to reach certain conclusions that would support their stated policy positions with regard to Iraq  141  CIA Special Activities Division paramilitary teams were the first teams in Iraq arriving in July 2002  Once on the ground they prepared the battle space for the subsequent arrival of US military forces  SAD teams then combined with US Army Special Forces  on a team called the Northern Iraq Liaison Element or NILE   142  This team organized the Kurdish Peshmerga for the subsequent US led invasion  They combined to defeat Ansar al Islam  an ally of Al Qaeda  If this battle had not been as successful as it was  there would have been a considerable hostile force behind the US Kurdish force in the subsequent assault on Saddam s Army  The US side was carried out by Paramilitary Operations Officers from SAD SOG and the Army s 10th Special Forces Group  142  143  144  SAD teams also conducted high risk special reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines to identify senior leadership targets  These missions led to the initial strikes against Saddam Hussein and his key generals  Although the initial strike against Hussein was unsuccessful in killing the dictator  it was successful in effectively ending his ability to command and control his forces  Other strikes against key generals were successful and significantly degraded the command s ability to react to and maneuver against the US led invasion force  142  145  NATO member Turkey refused to allow its territory to be used by the US Army s 4th Infantry Division for the invasion  As a result  the SAD  US Army Special Forces joint teams and the Kurdish Peshmerga were the entire northern force against Saddam s Army during the invasion  Their efforts kept the 1st and 5th Corps of the Iraqi Army in place to defend against the Kurds rather than their moving to contest the coalition force coming from the south  This combined US Special Operations and Kurdish force soundly defeated Saddam s Army  a major military success  similar to the victory over the Taliban in Afghanistan  142  Four members of the SAD SOG team received CIA s rare Intelligence Star for their  heroic actions   146  Drug trafficking Main articles  CIA transnational anti crime and anti drug activities and CIA drug trafficking Two offices of CIA Directorate of Intelligence have analytical responsibilities in this area  The Office of Transnational Issues 49  applies unique functional expertise to assess existing and emerging threats to US national security and provides the most senior US policymakers  military planners  and law enforcement with analysis  warning  and crisis support  CIA Crime and Narcotics Center 50  researches information on international narcotics trafficking and organized crime for policymakers and the law enforcement community  Since CIA has no domestic police authority  it sends its analytic information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI   Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  and other law enforcement organizations  such as the Drug Enforcement Administration  DEA  and the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury  OFAC   Another part of CIA  the National Clandestine Service  collects human intelligence  HUMINT  in these areas  Research by Dr  Alfred W  McCoy  Gary Webb  and others has pointed to CIA involvement in narcotics trafficking across the globe  although the CIA officially denies such allegations  147  148  During the Cold War  when numerous soldiers participated in transport of Southeast Asian heroin to the United States by the airline Air America  the CIA s role in such traffic was reportedly rationalized as  recapture  of related profits to prevent possible enemy control of such assets  Gary Webb and other researchers have reported about similar operations during Reagan s Contra War against the democratically elected government of Nicaragua  US involvement in Afghanistan during the Cold War  and current CIA involvement with Pakistan s ISI intelligence agency  which allegedly has links to the refining of Afghan heroin in Pakistan  Lying to Congress Former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi has stated that the CIA repeatedly misled the Congress since 2001 about waterboarding and other torture  though Pelosi admitted to being told about the programs  149  150  Six members of Congress have claimed that Director of CIA Leon Panetta admitted that over a period of several years since 2001 the CIA deceived Congress  including affirmatively lying to Congress  Some congressmen believe that these  lies  to Congress are similar to CIA lies to Congress from earlier periods  151  Covert programs hidden from Congress On July 10  2009  House Intelligence subcommittee Chairwoman Representative Jan Schakowsky  D  IL  announced the termination of an unnamed CIA covert program described as  very serious  in nature which had been kept secret from Congress for eight years  152   It s not as if this was an oversight and over the years it just got buried  There was a decision under several directors of the CIA and administration not to tell the Congress   Jan Schakowsky  Chairwoman  U S  House of Representatives Intelligence Subcommittee CIA Director Panetta had ordered an internal investigation to determine why Congress had not been informed about the covert program  Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Representative Silvestre Reyes announced that he is considering an investigation into alleged CIA violations of the National Security Act  which requires with limited exception that Congress be informed of covert activities  Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee Chairwoman Schakowsky indicated that she would forward a request for congressional investigation to HPSCI Chairman Silvestre Reyes   Director Panetta did brief us two weeks ago I believe it was on the 24th of June     and  as had been reported  did tell us that he was told that the vice president had ordered that the program not be briefed to the Congress   Dianne Feinstein  Chairwoman of the U S  Senate Select Committee on Intelligence As mandated by Title 50 of the United States Code Chapter 15  Subchapter III  when it becomes necessary to limit access to covert operations findings that could affect vital interests of the US  as soon as possible the President must report at a minimum to the Gang of Eight  the leaders of each of the two parties from both the Senate and House of Representatives  and the chairs and ranking members of both the Senate Committee and House Committee for intelligence   153  The House is expected to support the 2010 Intelligence Authorization Bill including a provision that would require the President to inform more than 40 members of Congress about covert operations  The Obama administration threatened to veto the final version of a bill that included such a provision  154  155  On July 16  2008 the fiscal 2009 Intelligence Authorization Bill was approved by House majority containing stipulations that 75  of money sought for covert actions would be held until all members of the House Intelligence panel were briefed on sensitive covert actions  Under the George W  Bush administration  senior advisers to the President issued a statement indicating that if a bill containing this provision reached the President  they would recommend that he veto the bill  156  The program was rumored vis a vis leaks made by anonymous government officials on July 23  to be an assassinations program  157  158  but this remains unconfirmed   The whole committee was stunned    I think this is as serious as it gets   stated Anna Eshoo  Chairman  Subcommittee on Intelligence Community Management  U S  House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence  HPSCI   Allegations by Director Panetta indicate that details of a secret counterterrorism program were withheld from Congress under orders from former US Vice President Dick Cheney  This prompted Senator Feinstein and Senator Patrick Leahy  chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to insist that no one should go outside the law  159   The agency hasn t discussed publicly the nature of the effort  which remains classified   said agency spokesman Paul Gimigliano  160  The Wall Street Journal reported  citing former intelligence officials familiar with the matter  that the program was an attempt to carry out a 2001 presidential authorization to capture or kill al Qaeda operatives  161  Intelligence Committee investigation On July 17  2009  the House Intelligence Committee said it was launching a formal investigation into the secret program  162  Representative Silvestre Reyes announced the probe will look into  whether there was any past decision or direction to withhold information from the committee    Is giving your kid a test in school an inhibition on his free learning   Holt said   Sure  there are some people who are happy to let intelligence agencies go about their business unexamined  But I think most people when they think about it will say that you will get better intelligence if the intelligence agencies don t operate in an unexamined fashion   Rush Holt  Chairman  House Select Intelligence Oversight Panel  Committee on Appropriations 163  Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky  D  IL   Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations  who called for the investigation  stated that the investigation was intended to address CIA failures to inform Congress fully or accurately about four issues  C I A  involvement in the downing of a missionary plane mistaken for a narcotics flight in Peru in 2001  and two  matters that remain classified   as well as the rumored assassinations question  In addition  the inquiry is likely to look at the Bush administration s program of eavesdropping without warrants and its detention and interrogation program  164  U S  Intelligence Chief Dennis Blair testified before the House Intelligence Committee on February 3  2010 that the U S  intelligence community is prepared to kill U S  citizens if they threaten other Americans or the United States  165  The American Civil Liberties Union has said this policy is  particularly troubling  because U S  citizens  retain their constitutional right to due process even when abroad   The ACLU also  expressed serious concern about the lack of public information about the policy and the potential for abuse of unchecked executive power   166  Disbandment Threats to disband the agency date back to the Kennedy administration  167  resurfaced during the 1975 Congressional testimony of DCI William Colby  168  and arose again following the Ames scandal in 1994  169  As recently as 2004  senators have repeated the need to end the agency  although this was for purposes of reorganization  rather than of eliminating or diminishing the agency   170  See also Government of the United States portal CIA in fiction Covert United States foreign regime change actions National Intelligence Board Reagan
