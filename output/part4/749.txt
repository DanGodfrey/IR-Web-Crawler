Lerner  a married couple who worked as computer operations staff members at Stanford University  later joined by Nicholas Pham  citation needed  founded Cisco Systems in 1984  Lerner briefly moved on to direct computer services at Schlumberger  but returned full time to Cisco in 1987  citation needed  The name  Cisco  was derived from the city name  San Francisco  which is why the company s engineers insisted on using the lower case  cisco  in the early days  For Cisco s first product  Bosack adapted multiple protocol router software originally written some years before by William Yeager  another Stanford employee who later joined Sun Microsystems  The company s first CEO was Bill Graves  who held the position from 1987 to 1988  6  In 1988  John Morgridge was appointed CEO  On February 16  1990  Cisco Systems went public  with a market capitalization of  224 million  and was listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange  On August 28  1990  Lerner was fired  upon hearing the news  her husband Bosack resigned in protest  The couple walked away from Cisco with  170 million  70  of which was committed to their own charity  7  Although Cisco was not the first company to develop and sell dedicated network nodes  8  it was one of the first to sell commercially successful routers supporting multiple network protocols  9  Classical  CPU based architecture of early Cisco devices coupled with flexibility of operating system IOS allowed for keeping up with evolving technology needs by means of frequent software upgrades  Some popular models of that time  such as Cisco 2500  managed to stay in production for almost a decade virtually unchanged   a rare sight in high tech industry  Although Cisco was strongly rooted in the enterprise environment  the company was quick to capture the emerging service provider environment  entering SP market with new  high capacity product lines such as Cisco 7000 and Cisco 7500  Between 1992 and 1994  Cisco also acquired several companies in Ethernet switching  most notably Kalpana  Grand Junction and Crescendo Communications which together formed the Catalyst business unit  At the time  the company envisioned layer 3 routing and layer 2  Ethernet  Token Ring  switching as complementary functions of different intelligence and architecture   the former was slow and complex  the latter was fast but simple  This philosophy dominated company s product lines throughout 1990s  In 1995  John Morgridge was succeeded by John Chambers   edit  1996 2005  Internet and silicon intelligence The phenomenal growth of Internet in mid to late 1990s quickly changed telecom landscape  As the Internet Protocol  IP  became widely adopted  the importance of multi protocol routing declined  Nevertheless  Cisco managed to catch the Internet wave  with products ranging from modem access shelves  AS5200  to core GSR routers that quickly became vital to Internet service providers and by 1998 gave Cisco de facto monopoly in this critical segment  In late March 2000  at the height of the dot com boom  Cisco became the most valuable company in the world  with a market capitalization of more than US 500 billion  10  11  In November 2011  with a market cap of about US 94 billion  12  it is still one of the most valuable companies  13  Meanwhile  the growth of Internet bandwidth requirements kept challenging traditional  software based packet processing architectures  The perceived complexity of programming routing functions in silicon led to formation of several startups determined to find new ways to process IP and MPLS packets entirely in hardware and blur boundaries between routing and switching  One of them  Juniper Networks  shipped their first product in 1999 and by 2000 chipped away about 30  from Cisco SP Market share  Cisco answered the challenge with homegrown ASICs and fast processing cards for GSR routers and Catalyst 6500 switches  In 2004  Cisco also started migration to new high end hardware CRS 1 and software architecture IOS XR   edit  2006 current  The Human Network As part of a massive rebranding campaign in 2006  Cisco Systems adopted the shortened name  Cisco  and created  The Human Network  advertising campaign  These efforts were meant to make Cisco a  household  brand   a strategy designed to support the low end Linksys products and future consumer products  such as Flip Video camera acquired by Cisco in 2009   On the more traditional business side  Cisco continued to develop its extensive enterprise focused routing  switching and security portfolio  Quickly growing importance of Ethernet also influenced the company s product lines  prompting the company to morph the successful Catalyst 6500 Ethernet switch into all purpose Cisco 7600 routing platform  14  However  limits of IOS and aging Crescendo architecture also forced Cisco to look at merchant silicon in the carrier Ethernet segment  This resulted in a new ASR9000 product family intended to consolidate company s carrier ethernet and subscriber management business around EZChip based hardware and IOS XR  Cisco also expanded into new markets by acquisition   one example being a 2009 purchase of mobile specialist Starent Networks that resulted in ASR5000 product line  Throughout mid 2000s Cisco also built a significant presence in India  establishing its Globalization Centre East in Bangalore for  1 billion planning that 20  of Cisco s leaders would be based there  15  However Cisco continued to be challenged by both domestic Alcatel Lucent  Juniper Networks and overseas competitors Huawei  Due to lower than expected profit in 2011  Cisco was forced to reduce annual expenses by  1 billion  The company cut around 3 000 employees with an early retirement program who accepted buyout and planned to eliminate as many as 10 000 jobs  around 14 percent of the 73 400 total employees before curtailment   16  17  During the 2011 analyst call  Cisco s CEO John Chambers called out several competitors by name  18  including Juniper and HP   edit  Media and awards Cisco products  most notably IP phones and Telepresence  are frequently sighted in movies and TV series  19  The company itself and its history was featured in the documentary film Something Ventured which premiered in 2011  Cisco was a 2002 03 recipient of the Ron Brown Award  20  21  a U S  presidential honor to recognize companies  for the exemplary quality of their relationships with employees and communities   Cisco commonly stays on top of Fortune  100 Best Companies to work for   with position No  20 in 2011 22   edit  Acquisitions Main article  List of acquisitions by Cisco Systems Cisco acquired a variety of companies to spin products and talent into the company  In 1995 1996 the company completed 11 acquisitions  23  Several acquisitions  such as Stratacom  were the biggest deals in the industry when they occurred  During the Internet boom in 1999  the company acquired Cerent Corporation  a start up company located in Petaluma  California  for about US 7 billion  It was the most expensive acquisition made by Cisco to date  and only the acquisition of Scientific Atlanta has been larger  Several acquired companies have grown into  1Bn  business units for Cisco  including LAN switching  Enterprise Voice over Internet Protocol  VOIP  platform Webex  and home networking  The latter came as result of Cisco acquiring Linksys in 2003 and in 2010 was supplemented with new product line dubbed Cisco Valet  Cisco announced on March 15  2012 that it is acquiring NDS Group for a  5B  24  This transaction is expected to complete in 4 6 months  In the recent merger deals  Cisco bought Starent Networks  a mobile technology company  and Moto Development Group  a product design consulting firm that helped develop Cisco s Flip video camera  25  Also in 2010  Cisco became a key stakeholder in e Skills Week  In March 2011  Cisco completed the acquisition of privately held network configuration and change management solutions company Pari Networks  26  Although many buy ins  such as Crescendo Networks  in 1993 resulted in acquisition of flagship technology  e g  Catalyst 6500  to Cisco  many others have failed   partially or completely  For instance  in 2010 Cisco occupied a meaningful share of the packet optical market  27  revenues were still not on par with US 7 billion price tag paid in 1999 for Cerent  Some of acquired technologies  such as Pure Digital and Tandberg  saw their products lines terminated 28   edit  Products and

surveillance and secured high definition video conferencing for leaders and first responders in crisis areas with up to 5 Mbit s of bandwidth via a 1 8 meter satellite antenna  NERVs are normally stored at Cisco facilities in San Jose  California and Research Triangle Park  North Carolina for strategic deployment in North America and are capable of being fully operational within 15 minutes of arrival  running for 72 hours continuously  44  45  The NERV has been deployed to incidents such as the October 2007 California wildfires  hurricanes Gustav  Ike  and Katrina  the 2010 San Bruno gas pipeline explosion  and tornado outbreaks in North Carolina and Alabama in 2011  46  In 2011  Cisco received the Innovation Preparedness award from the American Red Cross  Silicon Valley Chapter for its development and use of these vehicles in disasters  47   edit  Cisco Career Certifications Main article  Cisco Career Certifications Cisco Systems also sponsors a line of IT Professional certifications for Cisco products  There are five levels of certification  Entry  Associate  Professional  Expert  and recently Architect  as well as eight different paths  Routing  amp  Switching

portal called the Cisco Networking Academy  Qualifying schools can become members of the Cisco Networking Academy and then provide CCNA level or other level courses  Cisco Academy Instructors must be CCNA certified to be a CCAI certified instructor   edit  Criticisms and controversy  edit  Shareholder relations A class action lawsuit filed on April 20  2001 accused Cisco of making misleading statements that  were relied on by purchasers of Cisco stock  and of insider trading  48  While Cisco denied all allegations in the suit  on August 18  2006  Cisco s liability insurers  its directors  and officers paid the plaintiffs US 91 75 million to settle the suit  49   edit  Intellectual property disputes On December 11  2008  the Free Software Foundation filed suit against Cisco regarding Cisco s failure to comply with the GPL and LGPL license models and make the applicable source code publicly available  50  On May 20  2009  Cisco settled this lawsuit by complying with FSF licensing terms and making a monetary contribution to the FSF  51   edit  Censorship in China Cisco has been criticized for its involvement in censorship in the People s Republic of China  52  According to author Ethan Gutmann  Cisco and other telecommunications equipment providers supplied the Chinese government with surveillance and Internet infrastructure equipment that is used to block Internet websites and track Chinese on line activities  Cisco says that it does not customize or develop specialized or unique filtering capabilities to enable governments to block access to information and that it sells the same equipment in China as it sells worldwide  53  Wired News had uncovered a leaked  confidential Cisco powerpoint presentation that details the commercial opportunities of the Golden Shield Project of Internet control  54  In her article  journalist Sarah Stirland accuses Cisco of marketing its technology  specifically as a tool of repression    edit  Tax fraud investigation On October 16  2007  the Brazilian Federal Police and Brazilian Receita Federal  equivalent to the American IRS  under the  Persona Operation  uncovered an alleged tax fraud scheme employed by Cisco Systems since 2002 that exempted the company from paying over R 1 5 billion  US 824 million  in taxes  55  56   edit  Antitrust lawsuit On December 1  2008  Multiven filed an antitrust lawsuit 57  58  59  60  61  62  against Cisco Systems  Inc  in an effort to open up the network maintenance services marketplace for Cisco equipment  promote competition and ensure consumer choice and value  Multiven s complaint alleges that Cisco harmed Multiven and consumers by bundling and tying bug fixes patches and updates for its operating system software to its maintenance services  SMARTnet  and through a series of other illegal exclusionary and anticompetitive acts designed to maintain Cisco s alleged monopoly in the network maintenance services market for Cisco networking equipment  Cisco responded by accusing the person who filed the anti trust suit  British born Peter Alfred Adekeye  with hacking and pressured the US government to extradite him from Canada where he was giving evidence against Cisco in an anti trust hearing  Canadian Judge Ronald McKinnon  who oversaw the extradition hearing  stated the real reason for the extradition proceedings was because Alfred Adekeye  dared to take on a multinational giant   He also condemned the US prosecutor for hiding the fact that Alfred Adekeye was in legal proceedings against Cisco Systems  for stating that Alfred Adekeye had left the USA in a time period when he had not and a formal request for extradition was not filed against Alfred Adekeye when he was taken into custody  Judge McKinnon described the information provided by Cisco and the US prosecutor as  full of innuendo  half truths and falsehoods  adding  This speaks volumes for Cisco s duplicity  and accused them of  unmitigated gall  in using such a heavy handed move as an unsupportable arrest and jailing to pressure Alfred Adekeye to drop or settle his civil antitrust complaint  63   edit  Intimidation Cisco has been reported as using intimidation tactics in several news reports  64  65   edit  See also San Francisco Bay Area portal Companies portal List of information technology acronyms  edit  Notes    Cisco Contacts
