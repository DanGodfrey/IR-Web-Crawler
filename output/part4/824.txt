Steampunk From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search This article is about the genres of fiction and associated sub culture  For other uses  see Steampunk  disambiguation   A steampunk themed photo  Maison tournante a rienne   aerial rotating house  by Albert Robida for his book Le Vingti me Si cle  a 19th century conception of life in the 20th century Steampunk is a genre which came into prominence during the 1980s and early 1990s and incorporates elements of science fiction  fantasy  alternate history  horror  and speculative fiction  It involves a setting where steam power is widely used whether in an alternate history such as Victorian era Britain or  Wild West  era United States  or in a post apocalyptic time  that incorporates elements of either science fiction or fantasy  Works of steampunk often feature anachronistic technology  or futuristic innovations as Victorians might have envisioned them  based on a Victorian perspective on fashion  culture  architectural style  and art  This technology includes such fictional machines as those found in the works of H  G  Wells and Jules Verne  or the contemporary authors Philip Pullman  Scott Westerfeld and China Mieville  Other examples of steampunk contain alternative history style presentations of such technology as lighter than air airships  analog computers  or such digital mechanical computers as Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace s Analytical Engine  Steampunk also refers to art  fashion  and design that are informed by the aesthetics of Steampunk literature  1  Various modern utilitarian objects have been modded by individual artisans into a pseudo Victorian mechanical  steampunk  style  and a number of visual and musical artists have been described as steampunk  Contents 1 History 1

the style of  the 19th century scientific romances of Jules Verne  H G  Wells  and Mary Shelley  2   edit  Twentieth century precursors Several works of art and fiction significant to the development of the genre were produced before the genre had a name  Titus Alone  1959   by Mervyn Peake  anticipated many of the tropes of steampunk  3 Remedios Varo s paintings combine elements of Victorian dress  fantasy  and technofantasy imagery  4  One of the earliest mainstream manifestations of the steampunk ethos was the original CBS television series The Wild Wild West  1965 69   which inspired the film Wild Wild West  1999   2  5  The film Brazil  1985  was an important early cinematic influence to the genre  6  7   edit  Origin of the term Although many works now considered seminal to the genre were published in the 1960s and 1970s  the term steampunk originated in the late 1980s as a tongue in cheek variant of cyberpunk  It seems to have been coined by science fiction author K  W  Jeter  who was trying to find a general term for works by Tim Powers  The Anubis Gates  1983   James Blaylock   Homunculus  1986   and himself  Morlock Night  1979  and Infernal Devices  1987  all of which took place in a 19th century  usually Victorian  setting and imitated conventions of such actual Victorian speculative fiction as H  G  Wells  The Time Machine  In a letter to science fiction magazine Locus  printed in the April 1987 issue  Jeter wrote  Dear Locus  Enclosed is a copy of my 1979 novel Morlock Night  I d appreciate your being so good as to route it Faren Miller  as it s a prime piece of evidence in the great debate as to who in  the Powers Blaylock Jeter fantasy triumvirate  was writing in the  gonzo historical manner  first  Though of course  I did find her review in the March Locus to be quite flattering  Personally  I think Victorian fantasies are going to be the next big thing  as long as we can come up with a fitting collective term for Powers  Blaylock and myself  Something based on the appropriate technology of the era  like  steampunks   perhaps     K W  Jeter 8   edit  Modern steampunk While Jeter s Morlock Night and Infernal Devices  Power s Anubis Gates  and Blaylock s Lord Kelvin s Machine were the first novels to which Jeter s neologism would be applied  they gave the term little thought at the time 9   However  they were far from the first modern science fiction writers to speculate on the development of steam based technology or alternate histories  Keith Laumer s Worlds of the Imperium  1962  and Ronald W  Clark s Queen Victoria s Bomb  1967  apply modern speculation to past age technology and society  10 Michael Moorcock s Warlord of the Air  1971  11  is another early example  Harry Harrison s novel A Transatlantic Tunnel  Hurrah   1973  portrays a British Empire of an alternate year 1973  full of atomic locomotives  coal powered flying boats  ornate submarines  and Victorian dialogue  In February 1980 Richard A  Lupoff and Steve Stiles published the first  chapter  of their 10 part comic strip The Adventures of Professor Thintwhistle and His Incredible Aether Flyer  12  The first use of the word in a title was in Paul Di Filippo s 1995 Steampunk Trilogy  13  consisting of three short novels   Victoria    Hottentots   and  Walt and Emily   which  respectively  imagine the replacement of Queen Victoria by a human newt clone  an invasion of Massachusetts by Lovecraftian monsters  and a love affair between Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson   edit  Media See also  List of steampunk works  edit  Literary Cover of Issue 3 of Steampunk Magazine The 1981 educational book Elementary BASIC  Learning to Program Your Computer in Pascal with Sherlock Holmes by Henry Singer and Andrew Ledgar may have been the first fictional work to depict the use of Charles Babbage s Analytical Engine in an adventure story  The instructional book  aimed at young programming students  depicts Holmes using the engine as an aid in his investigations  and offers BASIC program listings to perform simple data processing tasks required to solve the fictional cases  The book even describes a possible enhancement to Babbage s machine  a device that allows the engine to be used remotely  through telegraph lines  The text was also available with examples in Pascal  1988 saw the publication of the first version of the science fiction roleplaying game Space  1889  set in an alternate history in which certain discredited Victorian scientific theories were probable  thus leading to new technologies  Contributing authors included Frank Chadwick  Loren Wiseman  and Marcus Rowland  14  William Gibson and Bruce Sterling s 1990 novel The Difference Engine is often credited with bringing widespread awareness of steampunk  5  15  This novel applies the principles of Gibson and Sterling s cyberpunk writings to an alternate Victorian era where Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage s proposed steam powered mechanical computer  which Babbage called a difference engine  a later  more general purpose version was known as an analytical engine   was actually built  and led to the dawn of the information age more than a century  ahead of schedule   This setting was different than most steampunk settings in that it takes a dim and dark view of this future rather than the more prevalent utopian versions  Nick Gevers s 2008 original anthology Extraordinary Engines features newer steampunk stories by some of the genre s pre eminent writers  as well as other leading science fiction and fantasy writers experimenting with neo Victorian conventions  A major retrospective reprint anthology of steampunk fiction was released  also in 2008  by Tachyon Publications  edited by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer and appropriately entitled Steampunk  it is a collection of stories by James Blaylock  whose  Narbondo  trilogy is typically considered steampunk  Jay Lake  author of the novel Mainspring  sometimes labeled  clockpunk   16  the aforementioned Michael Moorcock  as well as Jess Nevins  famed for his annotations to The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  While most of the original steampunk works had a historical setting  citation needed  later works often place steampunk elements in a fantasy world with little relation to any specific historical era  Historical steampunk tends to be science fiction that presents an alternate history  it also contains real locales and persons from history with alternate fantasy technology   Fantasy world steampunk   such as China Mi ville s Perdido Street Station  Alan Campbell s Scar Night  and Stephen Hunt s Jackelian novels  on the other hand  presents steampunk in a completely imaginary fantasy realm  often populated by legendary creatures coexisting with steam era and other anachronistic technologies  Self described and popular author of  far fetched fiction  Robert Rankin has increasingly incorporated elements of steampunk into narrative worlds  both Victorian and re imagined contemporary  In 2009  he was made a Fellow of the Victorian Steampunk Society  17   edit  Victorian In general  the category includes any recent science fiction that takes place in a recognizable historical period  sometimes an alternate history version of an actual historical period  in which the Industrial Revolution has already begun  but electricity is not yet widespread  citation needed  It places an emphasis on steam  or spring propelled gadgets  The most common historical steampunk settings are the Victorian and Edwardian eras  though some in this  Victorian steampunk  category can go as early as the beginning of the Industrial Revolution  Some examples of this type include the novel The Difference Engine  18  the comic book series League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  the Disney animated film Atlantis  The Lost Empire  2  the Anime series Fullmetal Alchemist and the roleplaying game Space  1889  2  Some  such as the comic series Girl Genius  2  have their own unique times and places despite partaking heavily of the flavor of historic times and settings  Karel Zeman s film The Fabulous World of Jules Verne  1958  is a very early example of cinematic steampunk  Based on Jules Verne novels  Zeman s film imagines a past based on those novels which never was  19  Other early examples of historical steampunk in cinema include Hayao Miyazaki s anime films such as Laputa  Castle in the Sky  1986   Howl s Moving Castle  2004   and Katsuhiro Otomo s  Steamboy   2004   All contain many archetypal anachronisms characteristic of the Steampunk genre  20  21   Historical  steampunk usually leans more towards science fiction than fantasy  but a number of historical steampunk stories have incorporated magical elements as well  For example  Morlock Night  written by K  W  Jeter  revolves around an attempt by the wizard Merlin to raise King Arthur to save Britain in 1892 from an invasion of Morlocks from the future  5 The Anubis Gates by Tim Powers involves a cabal of magicians among the beggars and thieves of the early 19th century London underworld  Paul Guinan s Boilerplate  a  biography  of a robot in the late 19th century  began as a website that garnered international press coverage when people began believing that Photoshop images of the robot with historic personages were real  22  The site was adapted into an illustrated hardbound book Boilerplate  History s Mechanical Marvel  and published by Abrams in October 2009  23  Because the story was not set in an alternate history  and in fact contained accurate information about the Victorian era  24  some specify  booksellers referred to the tome as  historical steampunk    edit  American West Another setting is  Western  steampunk  which overlaps with both the Weird West and Science fiction Western subgenres  Several other categories have arisen  sharing similar names  including dieselpunk  clockpunk  and others  Most of these terms were coined as supplements to the GURPS roleplaying game  and are not used in other contexts  25   edit  Alternate world Since the 1990s  the application of the steampunk label has expanded beyond works set in recognizable historical periods  to works set in fantasy worlds that rely heavily on steam  or spring powered technology  5  Fantasy steampunk settings abound in tabletop and computer role playing games  Notable examples include Skies of Arcadia  Final Fantasy VI  Final Fantasy IX  26 Rise of Nations  Rise of Legends  27  and Arcanum  Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura  2  The gnomes and goblins in World of Warcraft also have technological societies that could be described as steampunk 28  as they are vastly ahead of the technologies of men  but are not magical like those of the Elves  Amidst the historical and fantasy sub genres of steampunk is a type which takes place in a hypothetical future or a fantasy equivalent of our future  involving the domination of steampunk style technology and aesthetics  Examples include the anime series Steamboy  2004   Turn A Gundam  1999 2000   Trigun and Hayao Miyazaki s post apocalyptic anime Future Boy Conan  1978   29  and Disney s film Treasure Planet  2002   2   edit  Fantasy and horror See also  Cyberpunk derivatives Kaja Foglio introduced the term  Gaslight Romance  30   gaslamp fantasy  which John Clute and John Grant define as  steampunk stories     most commonly set in a romanticized  smoky  19th century London  as are Gaslight Romances  But the latter category focuses nostalgically on icons from the late years of that century and the early years of the 20th century  on Dracula  Jekyll and Hyde  Jack the Ripper  Sherlock Holmes and even Tarzan  and can normally be understood as combining supernatural fiction and recursive fantasy  though some gaslight romances can be read as fantasies of history   31  Some  such as author artist James Richardson Brown 32  use the term steamgoth to refer to Steampunk expressions of fantasy and horror with a  darker  bent   edit  Television and film The 1982 American TV series Q E D  set in Edwardian England  starred Sam Waterston as Professor Quentin Everett Deverill  the series title is the character s initials   The Professor was an inventor  and scientific detective in the mold of Sherlock Holmes  In the show  the lead character was known primarily by his initials  Q E D  The movie Wild  Wild West  starring Will Smith  featured many of the elements of advanced steam powered technology set in the wild west time period of the United States  The Adventures of Brisco County  Jr  a 1990s TV science fiction western set in the 1890s  on Fox Network  featured elements of steampunk as represented by the character Professor Wickwire  whose inventions were described as  the coming thing   33 Alan Moore s and Kevin O Neill s 1999 The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen graphic novel series  and the subsequent 2003 film adaption  greatly popularized the steampunk genre  34  The Syfy series Warehouse 13 features many steampunk inspired objects and artifacts  including computer designs created by steampunk artisan Richard Nagy  aka  Datamancer   35  Also  the Syfy miniseries Tin Man incorporates a considerable amount of steampunk inspired themes into a re imagining of L  Frank Baum s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  The BBC series Doctor Who also incorporates steampunk elements in the design of the Doctor s time machine  citation needed  the Tardis  first presented in the 1996 American co production when the Tardis interior was re designed to resemble an almost Victorian library with the central control console made up of eclectic and anachronistic objects  Modified and streamlined for the 2005 revival of the series  the Tardis console continues to incorporate steampunk elements  including a Victorian typewriter and gramophone  Steampunk has begun to attract notice from more  mainstream  sources  as well  For example  the episode of the TV series Castle entitled  Punked   which aired on October 11  2010  prominently featured the steampunk subculture and used Los Angeles area steampunks as extras 36  Also the music videos from both David Guetta s  Turn Me On  and Panic at the Disco s  The Ballad of Mona Lisa  have drawn heavily on steampunk inspirations   edit  Art  fashion  and design Tim Wetherell s Clockwork Universe sculpture at Questacon  Canberra  Australia  September 24  2009  Much of the visualizations of Steampunk have their origins with  among others  Walt Disney s 20 000 Leagues Under the Sea 37   including the design of the story s submarine the Nautilus  its interiors  and the crew s underwater gear  and George Pal s 1960 film The Time Machine  with the design of the time machine itself  This theme is also carried over to Disney s theme parks in the design of The Mysterious Island section of Tokyo DisneySea theme park  Steampunk design emphasizes a balance between the form and function  38  Like the Arts and Crafts Movement  this blurs the line between tool and decoration  Various modern utilitarian objects have been modified by enthusiasts into a pseudo Victorian mechanical  steampunk  style  7  39  Example objects include computer keyboards and electric guitars  40  The goal of such redesigns is to employ appropriate materials  such as polished brass  iron  wood  and leather  with design elements and craftsmanship consistent with the Victorian era 11  41   rejecting the aesthetic of industrial design  38  The artist group Kinetic Steam Works 42  brought a working steam engine to the Burning Man festival in 2006 and 2007  43  The group s founding member  Sean Orlando  created a Steampunk Tree House  in association with a group of people who would later form the Five Ton Crane Arts Group 44   that has been displayed at a number of festivals  45  46  The Steampunk Tree House is now permanently installed at the Dogfish Head Brewery in Milton  Delaware  47  48  In May June 2008  multimedia artist and sculptor Paul St George exhibited outdoor interactive video installations linking London and Brooklyn  New York  in a Victorian era styled telectroscope  49  50  Evelyn Kriete  a promoter  organized a transatlantic wave by steampunk enthusiasts from both cities  citation needed  briefly prior to White Mischief s Around the World in 80 Days steampunk themed event  Paul St George s Telectroscope installation at London City Hall  May 24  2008  In 2009 artist Tim Wetherell created a large wall piece for Questacon representing the concept of the clockwork universe  This steel artwork contains moving gears  a working clock  and a movie of the moon s terminator in action  The 3D moon movie was created by Antony Williams  From October 2009 through February 2010  the Museum of the History of Science  Oxford hosted the first major exhibition of Steampunk art objects  curated by Art Donovan and presented by Dr  Jim Bennett  museum director  51  From redesigned practical items to fantastical contraptions  this exhibition showcased the work of eighteen Steampunk artists from across the globe  The exhibition proved to be the most successful in the museum s history and attracted more than eighty thousand visitors  52  Spider Sculpture by Daniel Proulx 2012 saw the debut of the Mobilis in Mobili  An Exhibition of Steampunk Art and Appliance art exhibit  Originally located at New York City s Wooster Street Social Club  itself the subject of Television series NY Ink   the exhibit featured working Steampunk tattoo systems designed respectively by Bruce Rosenbaum of Modern Victorian House  Joey  Dr  Grymm  Marsocci  40   and Christopher Conte 53 showing very different approaches  37   bicycles  cell phones  guitars  timepieces and entertainment systems  53  rounded out the display  40   edit  Music Steampunk music is very broadly defined  as Caroline Sullivan says in The Guardian   Internet debates rage about exactly what constitutes the steampunk sound   50  This range of steampunk musical styles can be heard in the work of various steampunk artists  from the industrial dance world music of Abney Park  54  the inventor singer songwriter creations of Thomas Truax  50  55  the Carnatic influenced music of Sunday Driver  56  the  industrial hip hop opera  of Doctor Steel  57  58  the darkwave and progressive rock sounds of Vernian Process  59  60  the Unextraordinary Gentlemen  61  the electronic sounds of The Wet Glass RO  62  63 Darcy James Argue s 18 piece big band Secret Society and the musical storytelling of Escape the Clouds  64  The British American composer David Bruce s 2010 octet  Steampunk  was commissioned by Carnegie Hall  65  66   edit  Fandom and community Because of the popularity of steampunk  there is a growing movement towards establishing steampunk as a culture and lifestyle  67  Some fans of the genre adopt a steampunk aesthetic through fashion  68  home decor  music  and film  This may be described as neo Victorianism  which is the amalgamation of Victorian aesthetic principles with modern sensibilities and technologies  6  Some have proposed a steampunk philosophy  sometimes with punk inspired anti establishment sentiments  and typically bolstered by optimism about human potential  69  Author G  D  Falksen  wearing a steampunk styled arm prosthesis by Thomas Willeford  exemplifying one take on steampunk fashion  Steampunk fashion has no set guidelines  but tends to synthesize modern styles influenced by the Victorian era  This may include gowns  corsets  petticoats and bustles  suits with vests  coats  top hats 70  and spats  or military inspired garments  Steampunk influenced outfits are usually accented with several technological and period accessories  timepieces  parasols  flying driving goggles  and ray guns  Modern accessories like cell phones or music players can be found in steampunk outfits  after being modified to give them the appearance of Victorian made objects  Aspects of steampunk fashion have been anticipated by mainstream high fashion  the Lolita fashion and aristocrat styles  neo Victorianism  and the romantic goth subculture  6  34  54  Steampunk became a common descriptor for homemade objects on the craft network Etsy between 2009 and 2011  citation needed  though many of the objects and fashions bear little resemblance to earlier established steampunk descriptions  Thus the craft network may not strike observers as  sufficiently steampunk  to warrant the description  Comedienne April Winchell  author of the book  Regretsy  Where DIY meets WTF  catalogs some of the most egregious and humorous examples on her website  Regretsy   71  The blog is popular among steampunks and even inspired a music video that went viral in the community and was acclaimed by steampunk notables  72  2006 saw the first  SalonCon   a Neo Victorian Steampunk convention  It ran for three consecutive years and featured artists  musicians  Voltaire and Abney Park   authors  Catherynne M  Valente  Ekaterina Sedia  and G  D  Falksen   salons led by people prominent in their respective fields  workshops and panels on steampunk   as well as a seance  ballroom dance instruction  and the Chrononauts  Parade  The event was covered by MTV 73  and The New York Times  6  Steampunk has also become a regular feature at San Diego Comic Con International in recent years  with the Saturday of the four day event being generally known among steampunks as  Steampunk Day   and culminating with a photo shoot for the local press  74  75  The Saturday steampunk  after party  has also become a major event on the steampunk social calendar  in 2010 the headliners included The Slow Poisoner  Unextraordinary Gentlemen and Voltaire  with Veronique Chevalier as Mistress of Ceremonies and special appearance by the League of STEAM  76  77  and in 2011 UXG returned with Abney Park  78  Steampunk also has a growing following in the UK and Europe  The largest European event is  Weekend at the Asylum   held at The Lawn  Lincoln every September since 2009  Organized as a not for profit event by the Victorian Steampunk Society  the Asylum is a dedicated Steampunk event which takes over much of the historical quarter of Lincoln town and Lincoln Castle  In 2011 there were over 1000 steampunks in attendance  The event features the
