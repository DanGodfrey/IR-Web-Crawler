Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico   es ta o  lib e aso sja o  e  pwe to  riko  literally   Associated Free State of Puerto Rico    is an unincorporated territory of the United States  located in the northeastern Caribbean  east of the Dominican Republic and west of both the United States Virgin Islands and the British Virgin Islands  Puerto Rico  Spanish for  rich port   comprises an archipelago that includes the main island of Puerto Rico and a number of smaller islands  the largest of which are Vieques  Culebra  and Mona  The main island of Puerto Rico is the smallest by land area of the Greater Antilles  However  it ranks third in population amongst that group of four islands  which also include Cuba  Hispaniola  Dominican Republic and Haiti   and Jamaica  Due to its location  Puerto Rico enjoys a tropical climate and also experiences the Atlantic hurricane season  Originally populated for centuries by indigenous aboriginal peoples known as Ta nos  the island was claimed by Christopher Columbus for Spain during his second voyage to the Americas on November 19  1493  Under Spanish rule  the island was colonized and the indigenous population was forced into slavery and nearly wiped out due to  among other things  European infectious diseases  The remaining population was emancipated by King Charles I in 1520  Spain possessed Puerto Rico for over 400 years  despite attempts at capture of the island by France  the Netherlands  and England  The Spanish Crown  in an attempt to keep Puerto Rico from gaining its independence  revived the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815  The decree was printed in three languages   Spanish  English and French   and it fostered the immigration of hundreds of non Spanish European families  11  The relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States dates back to the Spanish American War  in which Spain  under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898  ceded the island to the United States  Puerto Ricans became U S  citizens in 1917  and the United States Congress legislates many aspects of Puerto Rican life  12  However  the islanders may not vote in U S  presidential elections  13  14  Since 1947  Puerto Ricans have been able to elect their own governor  Its official languages are Spanish and English  with Spanish being the primary language  The island s current political status  including the possibility of statehood or independence  is widely debated in Puerto Rico  Contents 1 Name 2 History 2 1 Pre Columbian era 2 2 Spanish colony 2 3 United States colony 2 4 Commonwealth 3 Government

n and Borinquen respectively  and are commonly used to identify someone of Puerto Rican heritage  The island is also popularly known in Spanish as la isla del encanto  which means  the island of enchantment  in English  Christopher Columbus named the island San Juan Bautista  in honor of Saint John the Baptist  Eventually  traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as  Puerto Rico   and  San Juan  became the name of the main trading shipping port  History Main article  History of Puerto Rico Pre Columbian era The ancient history of the archipelago known today as  Puerto Rico  before the arrival of Christopher Columbus is not well known  Unlike other larger more advanced indigenous communities in the New World  Aztec  Inca  which left behind abundant archeological and physical evidence of their societies  the indigenous population of Puerto Rico left scant records  What is known today about them comes from scarce archaeological findings and early Spanish scholarly accounts  Today  there are few and rare cave drawings  rock carvings and ancient recreational activity sites that have been identified with some degree of speculation as to who left them behind  The first comprehensive book on the history of Puerto Rico was written by Fray   igo Abbad y Lasierra in 1786  almost three centuries after the first Spaniards arrived on the island  18  Ta no Village at the Tibes Ceremonial Center The first settlers were the Ortoiroid people  an Archaic Period culture of Amerindian hunters and fishermen  An archaeological dig in the island of Vieques in 1990 found the remains of what is believed to be an Arcaico  Archaic  man  named  Puerto Ferro Man   dated to around 2000 BCE  19  The Igneri  a tribe from the region of the Orinoco river  in northern South America  arrived between 120 and 400 CE  The Arcaicos and Igneri co existed on the island between the 4th and 10th centuries  and perhaps clashed  Between the 7th and 11th centuries the Ta no culture developed on the island  and by approximately 1000 CE had become dominant  At the time of Columbus  arrival  an estimated 30 to 60 thousand Ta no Amerindians  led by cacique  chief  Ag eyban   inhabited the island  They called it Boriken   the great land of the valiant and noble Lord   20  The natives lived in small villages led by a cacique and subsisted on hunting  fishing and gathering of indigenous cassava root and fruit  This lasted until Columbus arrived in 1493  21  22  However  Puerto Rican culture today exhibits many Ta no influences within its music and vocabulary  Spanish colony Further information  Military history of Puerto Rico Europeans fight over Puerto Rico and Military history of Puerto Rico Revolt against Spain When Christopher Columbus arrived in Puerto Rico during his second voyage on November 19  1493  the island was inhabited by the Ta nos  23  They called the island  Borik n  or  in Spanish   Borinquen   note 2  Columbus named the island San Juan Bautista  in honor of Saint John the Baptist  The first Spanish settlement  Caparra  was founded on August 8  1508 by Juan Ponce de Le n  a lieutenant under Columbus  who later became the first governor of the island  note 3  Eventually  traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as  Puerto Rico   and  San Juan  became the name of the main trading shipping port  Garita at fort San Felipe del Morro Soon thereafter  the Spanish began to colonize the island  The indigenous population  Ta nos  came to be exploited and forced into slavery  14  Within 50 years they were reduced to near extinction by the harsh conditions of work and by European infectious diseases to which they had no natural immunity  24  For example  the smallpox outbreak in 1518 1519 wiped out much of the Island s indigenous population  25  In 1520  King Charles I of Spain issued a royal decree collectively emancipating the remaining Ta no population  Essentially  the Ta no presence while not completely extinct had almost vanished  26  The importation of Sub Saharan African slaves was introduced to provide the new manual work force for the Spanish colonists and merchants  Following the decline of the Ta no population  more slaves were brought to Puerto Rico  however  the number of slaves on the island paled in comparison to those in neighboring islands  27  African slavery was primarily restricted to coastal ports and cities  while the interior of the island continued to be essentially unexplored and undeveloped  Spanish and other European colonists were concentrated in island s seaports  Puerto Rico soon became an important stronghold and a significant port for Spanish Main colonial expansion  Various forts and walls  such as La Fortaleza  El Castillo San Felipe del Morro and El Castillo de San Crist bal  were built to protect the strategic port of San Juan from numerous European invasion attempts  San Juan served as an important port of call for ships of all European nations for purposes of taking on water  food and other commercial provisions and mercantile exchange  Marker in Puerto Rico which traces the routes taken by the Godspeed  Susan Constant and the Discovery and which commemorates their stopping in Puerto Rico from April 6 to 10  1607 on their way to Virginia In 1607  Puerto Rico served as a port provisioning the English ships Godspeed  Susan Constant and Discovery  which were on their way to establish Jamestown  Virginia  the first successful English settlement in the New World  The Netherlands and England made several attempts to capture Puerto Rico but failed to wrest it from the long term possession by Spain  which held tenaciously onto its increasingly prized island colony  28  29  During the late 17th and early 18th centuries  Spanish colonial emphasis continued to be focussed on the more prosperous mainland North  Central  and South American colonies  This continued distraction on the part of the Spanish Crown left the island of Puerto Rico virtually unexplored  undeveloped  and  excepting coastal outposts  largely unsettled before the nineteenth century  But as independence movements in the larger Spanish colonies grew successful  Spain began to pay attention to Puerto Rico as one of its last remaining maritime colonies  Amidst the attacks  Puerto Rican culture began to flourish  In 1786  the first comprehensive history of Puerto Rico Historia Geogr fica  Civil y Pol tica de Puerto Rico by Fray I igo Abbad y Lasierra was published in Madrid  documenting the history of Puerto Rico from the time of Columbus  landing in 1493 until 1783  30  The book also presents a first hand account of Puerto Rican identity  including music  clothing  personality and nationality  In 1779  citizens of the still Spanish colony of Puerto Rico fought in the American Revolutionary War under the command of Bernardo de G lvez  named Field Marshal of the Spanish colonial army in North America  Puerto Ricans participated in the capture of Pensacola  the capital of the British colony of West Florida  and the cities of Baton Rouge  St  Louis and Mobile  The Puerto Rican troops  under the leadership of Brigadier General Ram n de Castro  31  helped defeat the British and Indian army of 2 500 soldiers and British warships in Pensacola  32  In 1809  in a further move to secure its political bond with the island and in the midst of the European Peninsular War  the Supreme Central Junta based in C diz recognized Puerto Rico as an overseas province of Spain with the right to send representatives to the recently convened Spanish parliament with equal representation to Mainland Iberian  Mediterranean  Balearic Islands  and Atlantic maritime Spanish provinces  Canary Islands   The first Spanish parliamentary representative from the island of Puerto Rico  Ramon Power y Giralt  died after serving a three year term in the Cortes  These parliamentary and constitutional reforms  which were in force from 1810 to 1814 and again from 1820 to 1823  were reversed twice afterwards when the traditional monarchy was restored by Ferdinand VII  Nineteenth century immigration and commercial trade reforms further augmented the island s European population and economy  and expanded Spanish cultural and social imprint on the local character of the island  Royal Decree of Graces  1815  which allowed foreigners to enter Puerto Rico Minor slave revolts had occurred in the island during this period  However the revolt planned and organized by Marcos Xiorro in 1821  was the most important of them all  Even though the conspiracy was unsuccessful  Xiorro achieved legendary status among the slaves and is part of Puerto Rico s folklore  33  In the early 19th century  Puerto Rico had an Independence movement which  due to the harsh persecution by the Spanish authorities  met in the island of St  Thomas  The movement was largely inspired by the ideals of Sim n Bol var of establishing a United Provinces of New Granada which included Puerto Rico and Cuba  Among the influential members of this movement was Brigadier General Antonio Valero de Bernabe  a Puerto Rican military leader known in Latin America as the  Liberator from Puerto Rico  who fought alongside Bolivar and Mar a de las Mercedes Barbudo  a businesswoman also known as the  first Puerto Rican female freedom fighter   The movement was discovered and Governor Miguel de la Torre had its members imprisoned or exiled  34  With the increasingly rapid growth of independent former Spanish colonies in the South and Central American states in the first part of the century  Puerto Rico and Cuba continued to grow in strategic importance to the Spanish Crown  In a very deliberate move to increase its hold on its last two new world colonies  the Spanish Crown revived the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815  This time the decree was printed in three languages  Spanish  English and French  Its primary intent was to attract Europeans of who were not of Spanish origin  with the hope that the independence movements would lose their popularity and strength with increase of new loyalist settlers with strong sympathies to Spain  As a consequence hundreds of families  mainly from Corsica  France  Germany  Ireland  Italy and Scotland  immigrated to the island  11  In 1858  Samuel Morse introduced wired communication to Latin America when he established a telegraph system in Puerto Rico  Morse s oldest daughter Susan Walker Morse  1821 1885   would often visit her uncle Charles Pickering Walker who owned the Hacienda Concordia in the town of Guayama  Morse  who often spent his winters at the Hacienda with his daughter and son in law  who lived and owned the Habienda Henriqueta  set a two mile telegraph line connecting his son in law s hacienda to their house in Arroyo  The line was inaugurated on March 1  1859 in a ceremony flanked by the Spanish and American flags  35  36  The first lines transmitted by Morse that day in Puerto Rico were   Puerto Rico  beautiful jewel  When you are linked with the other jewels of the Antilles in the necklace of the world s telegraph  yours will not shine less brilliantly in the crown of your Queen   As an incentive to immigrate and colonize  free land was offered to those who wanted to populate the two islands on the condition that they swear their loyalty to the Spanish Crown and allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church  11  It was very successful and European immigration continued even after 1898  Puerto Rico today still receives Spanish and European immigration  The Original Lares Revolutionary Flag Poverty and political estrangement with Spain led to a small but significant uprising in 1868 known as  Grito de Lares   It began in the rural town of Lares  but was subdued when rebels moved to the neighboring town of San Sebasti n  Leaders of this independence movement included Ram n Emeterio Betances  considered the  father  of the Puerto Rican independence movement  and other political figures such as Segundo Ruiz Belvis  Flag flown by Fidel V lez and his men during the  Intentona de Yauco  revolt Leaders of  El Grito de Lares   who were in exile in New York City  joined the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee  founded on December 8  1895  and continued their quest for Puerto Rican independence  In 1897  Antonio Mattei Lluberas and the local leaders of the independence movement of the town of Yauco organized another uprising  which became known as the  Intentona de Yauco   This was the first time that the current Puerto Rican flag was unfurled on Puerto Rican soil  The local conservative political factions  which believed that such an attempt would be a threat to their struggle for  colonial  autonomy  opposed such an action  Rumors of the planned event spread to the local Spanish authorities who acted swiftly and put an end to what would be the last major uprising in the island to Spanish colonial rule  37  In 1897  Luis Mu oz Rivera and others persuaded the liberal Spanish government to agree to Charters of Autonomy for Cuba and Puerto Rico  In 1898  Puerto Rico s first  but short lived  autonomous government was organized as an  overseas province  of Spain  This bilaterally agreed upon charter maintained a governor appointed by Spain  which held the power to annul any legislative decision  and a partially elected parliamentary structure  In February  Governor General Manuel Mac as inaugurated the new government under the Autonomous Charter  General elections were held in March and the autonomous government began to function on July 17  1898  38  39  40  United States colony Main article  Puerto Rican Campaign First Company of native Puerto Ricans enlisted in the American Colonial Army  1899 In 1890  Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan  a member of the Navy War Board and leading U S  strategic thinker  wrote a book titled The Influence of Sea Power upon History in which he argued for the creation of a large and powerful navy modeled after the British Royal Navy  Part of his strategy called for the acquisition of colonies in the Caribbean Sea which would serve as coaling and naval stations and which would serve as strategical points of defense upon the construction of a canal in the Isthmus  41  This idea was not new  since William H  Seward  the former Secretary of State under the administrations of various presidents  among them Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses Grant  had stressed that a canal be built either in Honduras  Nicaragua or Panama and that the United States annex the Dominican Republic and purchase Puerto Rico and Cuba  The idea of annexing the Dominican Republic failed to receive the approval of the U S  Senate and Spain did not accept the 160 million dollars which the U S  offered for Puerto Rico and Cuba  41  Captain Mahan made the following statement to the War Department  Having therefore no foreign establishments either colonial or military  the ships of war of the United States  in war will be like land birds  unable to fly far from their own shores  To provide resting places for them where they can coal and repair  would be one of the first duties of a government proposing to itself the development of the power of the nation at sea 42  Since 1894  the Naval War College had been formulating contingency plans for a war with Spain  By 1896  the Office of Naval Intelligence had prepared a plan which included military operations in Puerto Rican waters  This prewar planning did not contemplate major territorial acquisitions  Except for one 1895 plan which recommended annexation of the island then named Isle of Pines  later renamed as Isla de la Juventud   a recommendation dropped in later planning  plans developed for attacks on Spanish territories were intended as support operations against Spain s forces in and around Cuba  43  However  Jorge Rodriguez Beruf  recognized as a foremost researcher on United States militarism in Puerto Rico  44  writes that not only was Puerto Rico considered valuable as a naval station  Puerto Rico and Cuba were also abundant in sugar   a valuable commercial commodity which the United States lacked  45  Children in a company housing settlement  San Juan  1941 On July 25  1898  during the Spanish American War  Puerto Rico was invaded by the United States with a landing at Gu nica  As an outcome of the war  Spain ceded Puerto Rico  along with the Philippines and Guam  that were under Spanish sovereignty  to the U S  under the Treaty of Paris  Spain relinquished sovereignty over Cuba  but did not cede it to the U S  46  The United States and Puerto Rico thus began a long standing relationship  Puerto Rico began the 20th century under the military rule of the U S  with officials  including the governor  appointed by the President of the United States  The Foraker Act of 1900 gave Puerto Rico a certain amount of civilian popular government  including a popularly elected House of Representatives  also a judicial system following the American legal system that includes both state courts and federal courts establishing a Puerto Rico Supreme Court and a United State District Court  and a non voting member of Congress  by the title of  Resident Commissioner   In addition  this Act extended all U S  laws  not locally inapplicable  to Puerto Rico  specifying specific exemption from U S  Internal Revenue laws  47  The act empowered the civil government to legislate on  all matters of legislative character not locally inapplicable   including the power to modify and repeal any laws then in existence in Puerto Rico  though the U S  Congress retained the power to annul acts of the Puerto Rico legislature  47  48  During an address to the Puerto Rican legislature in 1906  President Theodore Roosevelt recommended that Puerto Ricans become U S  citizens  47  In 1917   Puerto Ricans were collectively made U S  citizens  49  via the Jones Act  The same Act also provided for a popularly elected Senate to complete a bicameral Legislative Assembly  a bill of rights and authorized the election of a Resident Commissioner to a four year term  As a result of their new U S  citizenship  many Puerto Ricans were drafted into World War I and all subsequent wars with U S  participation in which a national military draft was in effect  Soldiers of the 65th Infantry training in Salinas  Puerto Rico  August 1941 Natural disasters  including a major earthquake  a tsunami and several hurricanes  and the Great Depression impoverished the island during the first few decades under U S  rule  50  Some political leaders  like Pedro Albizu Campos who led the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party  demanded change  On March 21  1937  a march was organized in the southern city of Ponce by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party  This march turned bloody when the Insular Police   a force somewhat resembling the National Guard which answered to the U S  appointed governor   51  opened fire upon unarmed 51  and defenseless 52  cadets and bystanders alike  51  52  as reported by a U S  Congressman Vito Marcantonio and the  Hays Commission  led by Arthur Garfield Hays  Nineteen were killed and over 200 were badly wounded  52  many in their backs while running away  52  53  An American Civil Liberties Union report declared it a massacre 52  and it has since been known as the Ponce Massacre  On April 2  1943  U S  Senator Millard Tydings introduced a bill in Congress calling for independence for Puerto Rico  This bill ultimately was defeated  47  The internal governance changed during the latter years of the Roosevelt Truman administrations  as a form of compromise led by Luis Mu oz Mar n and others  It culminated with the appointment by President Truman in 1946 of the first Puerto Rican born governor  Jes s T  Pi ero  Commonwealth In 1947  the U S  granted Puerto Ricans the right to elect democratically their own governor  Luis Mu oz Mar n was elected during the 1948 general elections  becoming the first popularly elected governor of Puerto Rico  A Bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and nationalist movements in the island  The Senate at the time was controlled by the PPD  and was presided over by Luis Mu oz Mar n  54  The Bill  also known as the Ley de la Mordaza   Gag Law   was approved by the legislature on May 21  1948  It made it illegal to display a Puerto Rican flag  to sing a patriotic tune  to talk of independence  or to fight for the liberation of the island  The Bill  which resembled the anti communist Smith Law passed in the United States  was signed and made into law on June 10  1948  by the U S  appointed governor of Puerto Rico  Jes s T  Pi ero  and became known as Ley 53   Law 53    55  In accordance to the new law  it would be a crime to print  publish  sell  exhibit  organize or help anyone organize any society  group or assembly of people whose intentions are to paralyze or destroy the insular government  Anyone accused and found guilty of disobeying the law could be sentenced to ten years of prison  be fined  10 000 dollars  US   or both  According to Dr  Leopoldo Figueroa  a member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives  the law was repressive  and was in violation of the First Amendment of the US Constitution  which guarantees Freedom of Speech  He pointed out that the law as such was a violation of the civil rights of the people of Puerto Rico  The infamous law was repealed in 1957  56  Painting depiction of the U S  65th Infantry Regiment s bayonet charge against a Chinese division during the Korean War  In 1950  the U S  Congress approved Public Law 600  P L  81 600  which allowed for a democratic referendum in Puerto Rico to determine whether Puerto Ricans desired to draft their own local constitution  57  This act was meant to be adopted in the  nature of a compact   It required congressional approval of the Puerto Rico Constitution before it could go into effect  and repealed certain sections of the Organic Act of 1917  The sections of this statute left in force were then entitled the Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act  58  59  External videos View newsreel scenes in Spanish of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s On October 30  1950  Pedro Albizu Campos and other nationalists led a 3 day revolt against the United States in various cities and towns of Puerto Rico  The most notable occurred in Jayuya and Utuado  In the Jayuya revolt  known as the Jayuya Uprising  the United States declared martial law  and attacked Jayuya with infantry  artillery and bombers  The Utuado Uprising culminated in what is known as the Utuado massacre  On November 1  1950  Puerto Rican nationalists Griselio Torresola and Oscar Collazo attempted to assassinate President Harry S Truman  Torresola was killed during the attack  but Collazo was captured  Collazo served 29 years in a federal prison  being released in 1979  Don Pedro Albizu Campos also served many years in a federal prison in Atlanta  Georgia  for seditious conspiracy to overthrow the U S  government in Puerto Rico  60  The Constitution of Puerto Rico was approved by a Constitutional Convention on February 6  1952  ratified by the U S  Congress  approved by President Truman on July 3 of that year  and proclaimed by Gov  Mu oz Mar n on July 25  1952  on the anniversary of the July 25  1898  landing of U S  troops in the Puerto Rican Campaign of the Spanish American War  until then an annual

United States Congress legislates over many fundamental aspects of Puerto Rican life  including citizenship  currency  postal service  foreign affairs  military defense  communications  labor relations  the environment  commerce  finance  health and welfare  and many others  12  63  During the 1950s  Puerto Rico experienced rapid industrialization  due in large part to Operaci n Manos a la

tourist destination  as well as a global center for pharmaceutical manufacturing  64  Yet it still struggles to define its political status  Three plebiscites have been held in recent decades to resolve the political status  but no changes have been attained  Support for the pro statehood party  Partido Nuevo Progresista  PNP   and the pro commonwealth party  Partido Popular Democr tico  PPD

primaries  Puerto Ricans who become residents of a U S  state can vote in presidential elections  As Puerto Rico is not an independent country and  as such  it hosts no embassies  It is host  however  to consulates from 41 countries  mainly from the Americas and Europe  70  Most consulates are located in San Juan  As an unincorporated territory of the United States  Puerto Rico does not have any first order administrative divisions as defined by the U S  government  but has 78 municipalities at the second level  Mona Island is not a municipality  but part of the municipality of Mayag ez  71  Municipalities are subdivided into wards or barrios  and those into sectors  Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected for a four year term  The municipality of San Juan  previously called  town    was founded first  in 1521  San Germ n in 1570  Coamo in 1579  Arecibo in 1614  Aguada in 1692 and Ponce in 1692  An increase of settlement saw the founding of 30 municipalities in the 18th century and 34 in the 19th  Six were founded in the 20th century  the last was Florida in 1971  72  Since 1952 Puerto Rico has had three main political parties  the Popular Democratic Party  PPD   the New Progressive Party  PNP  and the Puerto Rican Independence Party  PIP   These three parties stood for three distinct future political status scenarios  the PPD seeks to maintain the island s  association  status with the U S  as a commonwealth  and has won a plurality vote in referendums on the island s status held over the last six decades  the PNP seeks to have Puerto Rico become a U S  state  and the PIP seeks the establishment of a sovereign and independent republic  In 2007  a fourth party  the Puerto Ricans for Puerto Rico Party  PPR   was registered  The PPR claims that it seeks to address the islands  problems from a status neutral platform  However  it ceased to remain a registered political party when it failed to obtain the requisite number of votes in the 2008 general election  Non registered parties include the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party  the Socialist Workers Movement  the Hostosian National Independence Movement  Political status Main article  Political status of Puerto Rico The nature of Puerto Rico s political relationship with the U S  is the subject of ongoing debate in Puerto Rico  the United States Congress  and the United Nations  Specifically  the basic question is whether Puerto Rico should remain a U S  territory  become a U S  state  or become an independent country  73  74  Estado Libre Asociado In 1950  the U S  Congress granted Puerto Ricans the right to organize a constitutional convention via a referendum that gave them the option of voting their preference   yes  or  no   on a proposed U S  law that would organize Puerto Rico as a  commonwealth  that would continue United States sovereignty over Puerto Rico and its people  Puerto Rico s electorate expressed its support for this measure in 1951 with a second referendum to ratify the constitution  The Constitution of Puerto Rico was formally adopted on July 3  1952  The Constitutional Convention specified the name by which the body politic would be known  On February 4  1952  the convention approved Resolution 22 which chose in English the word Commonwealth  meaning a  politically organized community  or  state   which is simultaneously connected by a compact or treaty to another political system  Puerto Rico officially designates itself with the term  Commonwealth of Puerto Rico  in its constitution  as a translation into English of the term to  Estado Libre Asociado   ELA   Literally translated into English the phrase Estado Libre Asociado means  Associated Free State   The preamble of the Commonwealth constitution in part reads   We  the people of Puerto Rico  in order to organise ourselves politically on a fully democratic basis     do ordain and establish this Constitution for the commonwealth which  in the exercise of our natural rights  we now create within our union with the United States of America  In so doing  we declare      We consider as determining factors in our life our citizenship of the United States of America and our aspiration continually to enrich our democratic heritage in the individual and collective enjoyment of its rights and privileges  our loyalty to the principles of the Federal Constitution     While the approval of the commonwealth constitution by the people of Puerto Rico  the U S  Congress and the U S  President  as a federal law  marked a historic change in the civil government for the islands  neither it nor the public laws approved by Congress in 1950 and 1952 revoked statutory provisions concerning the legal relationship of Puerto Rico to the United States  This relationship is based on the Territorial Clause of the U S  Constitution  The statutory provisions that set forth the conditions of the relationship are commonly referred to as the Federal Relations Act  FRA   75  Inclusive by Resolution number 34  approved by the Constitutional Convention and ratified in the Referendum held on November 4  1952  the following new sentence was added to section 3 of article VII of the commonwealth constitution   Any amendment or revision of this constitution shall be consistent with the resolution enacted by the applicable provisions of the Constitution of the United States  with the Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act and with Public Law 600  Eighty first Congress  adopted in the nature of a compact   76  The provisions of the Federal Relations Act as codified on the U S  Code Title 48  Chapter 4 shall apply to the island of Puerto Rico and to the adjacent islands belonging to the United States and waters of those islands  and the name Puerto Rico  as used in the chapter  shall be held to include not only the island of that name  but all the adjacent islands as aforesaid  77  While specified subsections of the FRA were  adopted in the nature of a compact   other provisions  by comparison  are excluded from the compact reference  Matters still subject to congressional authority and established pursuant to legislation include the citizenship status of residents  tax provisions  civil rights  trade and commerce  public finance  the administration of public lands controlled by the federal government  the application of federal law over navigable waters  congressional representation  and the judicial process  among others  78  79  In 1967  Puerto Rico s Legislative Assembly polled the political preferences of the Puerto Rican electorate by passing a plebiscite act that provided for a vote on the status of Puerto Rico  This constituted the first plebiscite by the Legislature for a choice among three status options  commonwealth  statehood  and independence   Claiming  foul play  and dubbing the process as illegitimate and contrary to norms of international law regarding decolonization procedures  the plebiscite was boycotted by the major pro statehood and pro independence parties of the time  the Republican Party of Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rican Independence Party  respectively  The Commonwealth option  represented by the PDP  won with a majority of 60 4  of the votes  After the plebiscite  efforts in the 1970s  1980s  1990s and 2000s to enact legislation to address the status issue died in U S  Congressional committees  In subsequent plebiscites organized by Puerto Rico held in 1993 and 1998  without any formal commitment on the part of the U S  Government to honor the results   the current political status failed to receive majority support  In 1993  Commonwealth status won by only a plurality of votes  48 6  versus 46 3  for statehood   while the  none of the above  option  which was the Popular Democratic Party sponsored choice  won in 1998 with 50 3  of the votes  versus 46 5  for statehood   Disputes arose as to the definition of each of the ballot alternatives  and Commonwealth advocates  among others  reportedly urged a vote for  none of the above   80  81  82  Within the United States Puerto Rico  U S  quarter  reverse side  2009 Constitutionally  Puerto Rico is subject to the Congress s plenary powers under the territorial clause of Article IV  sec  3  of the U S  Constitution  83  U S  federal law applies to Puerto Rico  even though Puerto Rico is not a state of the American Union and their residents have no voting representation in the U S  Congress  Like the States of the American Union  Puerto Rico lacks  the full sovereignty of an independent nation   for example  the power to manage its  external relations with other nations   which was retained by the Federal Government  The Supreme Court has indicated that once the Constitution has been extended to an area  by Congress or the Courts   its coverage is irrevocable  To hold that the political branches may switch the Constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they  not this Court  say  what the law is    84  Puerto Ricans  were collectively made U S  citizens  in 1917 as a result of the Jones Shafroth Act  85  However  U S  citizens residing in Puerto Rico cannot vote for the U S  president  Since Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory  see above  and not a U S  state  the United States Constitution does not fully enfranchise US citizens residing in Puerto Rico  66  86  See also   Voting rights in Puerto Rico    Despite their American citizenship  however  only the  fundamental rights  under the federal constitution apply to Puerto Ricans  Various other U S Supreme Court decisions have been held opinions on which rights apply in Puerto Rico and which ones do not  Puerto Ricans have a long history of service in the U S  armed forces and  since 1917  they have been included in the U S  compulsory draft whenever it has been in effect  Though the Commonwealth government has its own tax laws  Puerto Ricans are also required to pay most U S  federal taxes  with the major exception being the federal personal income tax  87  88  89  90  91  92  93  94  In 2009  Puerto Rico paid  3 742 billion into the US Treasury  95  Residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security  and are thus eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement  However  they are excluded from the Supplemental Security Income  SSI   and the island actually receives a small fraction of the Medicaid funding it would receive if it were a U S  state  96  Also  Medicare providers receive less than full state like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in Puerto Rico  even though the latter paid fully into the system  97  In 1992  President George H  W  Bush issued a memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico  This memorandum directs all federal departments  agencies  and officials to treat Puerto Rico administratively as if it were a state  insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operations  Federal executive branch agencies have significant presence in Puerto Rico  just as in any state  including the Federal Bureau of Investigation  Federal Emergency Management Agency  Transportation Security Administration  Social Security Administration  and others  While Puerto Rico has its own Commonwealth judicial system similar to that of a U S  state  there is also a federal district court in Puerto Rico  and Puerto Rican judges have served in that Court and in other federal courts on the mainland regardless of their residency status at the time of their appointment  Puerto Ricans are also regularly appointed to high level federal positions  including serving as United States Ambassadors  International status On November 27  1953  shortly after the establishment of the Commonwealth  the General Assembly of the United Nations approved Resolution 748  removing Puerto Rico s classification as a non self governing territory under article 73 e  of the Charter from UN  But the General Assembly did not apply the full list of criteria which was enunciated in 1960 when it took favorable note of the cessation of transmission of information regarding the non self governing status of Puerto Rico  98  99  According to the White House Task Force on Puerto Rico s Political Status in its December 21  2007 report  the U S   in its written submission to the UN in 1953  never represented that Congress could not change its relationship with Puerto Rico without the territory s consent  100  It stated that the U S  Justice Department in 1959 reiterated that Congress held power over Puerto Rico pursuant to the Territorial Clause 101  of the U S  Constitution  100  In 1993  the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit stated that Congress may unilaterally repeal the Puerto Rican Constitution or the Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act and replace them with any rules or regulations of its choice  79  In a 1996 report on a Puerto Rico status political bill  the U S  House Committee on Resources stated   Puerto Rico s current status does not meet the criteria for any of the options for full self government under Resolution 1541   the three established forms of full self government being stated in the report as  1  national independence   2  free association based on separate sovereignty  or  3  full integration with another nation on the basis of equality   The report concluded that Puerto Rico      remains an unincorporated territory and does not have the status of  free association  with the United States as that status is defined under United States law or international practice   that the establishment of local self government with the consent of the people can be unilaterally revoked by the U S  Congress  and that U S  Congress can also withdraw the U S  citizenship of Puerto Rican residents of Puerto Rico at any time  for a legitimate Federal purpose  102  103  The application of the U S  Constitution to Puerto Rico is limited by the Insular Cases  The United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization passed a resolution and adopted a consensus text introduced by Cuba s delegate on June 20  2011  calling on the United States to expedite a process  that would allow Puerto Ricans to fully exercise their inalienable right to self determination and independence    104  Recent developments In 2005 and 2007  two reports were issued by the U S  President s Task Force on Puerto Rico s Status  47  100  Both reports conclude that Puerto Rico continues to be a territory of U S  under the plenary powers of the U S  Congress  100  Reactions from Puerto Rico s two major political parties were mixed  The Popular Democratic Party  PPD  challenged the task force s report citation needed  and committed to validating the current status in all international forums  including the United Nations  It also rejected citation needed  any  colonial or territorial status  as a status option  and vowed to keep working for the enhanced Commonwealth status that was approved by the PPD in 1998  which included sovereignty  an association based on  respect and dignity between both nations   and common citizenship  105  The New Progressive Party  PNP  supported citation needed  the White House Report s conclusions and supported bills to provide for a democratic referendum process among Puerto Rico voters  Congressman Luis Fortu o meets with mayors from across the island of Puerto Rico in his congressional office  2006  According to a CRS report  the recent activity regarding Puerto Rico s political status  in Congress and on the island  suggests that action may be taken in the 111th Congress  The reports issued in 2007 and 2005 by the President s Task Force on Puerto Rico s Status may be the basis for reconsideration of the existing commonwealth status  as legislative developments during the 109th and 110th Congresses suggested  Agreement on the process to be used in considering the status proposals has been as elusive as agreement on the end result  Congress would have a determinative role in any resolution of the issue  The four options that appear to be most frequently discussed include continuation of the commonwealth  modification of the current commonwealth agreement  statehood  or independence  If independence  or separate national sovereignty  were selected  Puerto Rican officials might seek to negotiate a compact of free association with the United States  106  On June 15  2009  the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization approved a draft resolution calling on the Government of the United States to expedite a process that would allow the Puerto Rican people to exercise fully their inalienable right to self determination and independence  107  On April 29  2010  the U S  House voted 223 169 to approve a measure for a federally sanctioned process for Puerto Rico s self determination  allowing Puerto Rico to set a new referendum on whether to continue its present form of commonwealth political status or to have a different political status  If Puerto Ricans vote to continue to have their present form of political status  the Government of Puerto Rico is authorized to conduct additional plebiscites at intervals of every eight years from the date on which the results of the prior plebiscite are certified  if Puerto Ricans vote to have a different political status  a second referendum would determine whether Puerto Rico would become a U S  state  an independent country  or a sovereign nation associated with the U S  that would not be subject to the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution  108  During the House debate  a fourth option  to retain its present form of commonwealth  status quo  political status  was added as an option in the second plebiscite  108  109  Immediately following U S  House passage  H R  2499 was sent to the U S  Senate  where it was given two formal readings and referred to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources  A Senate hearing was held on May 19  2010  for the purpose of gathering testimony on the bill  Among those offering testimony were Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico  Pedro Pierluisi  Governor of Puerto Rico  Luis Fortu o  President of the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico  H ctor Ferrer  and President of the Puerto Rican Independence Party  Rub n Berr os  110  According to the Senate Energy  amp  Natural Resources Committee leadership  the four options are the continuation of the current commonwealth status  subject to the territorial clause  under Article IV of the Constitution   statehood  independence  and free association  111  112  113  On December 22  2010  the 111th United States Congress adjourned without any Senate vote on H R 2499  killing the bill  114  The latest Task Force report was released on March 11  2011  The report suggests a two plebiscite process  including a  first plebiscite that requires the people of Puerto Rico to choose whether they wish to be part of the United States  either via Statehood or Commonwealth  or wish to be independent  via Independence or Free Association   If continuing to be part of the United States were chosen in the first plebiscite  a second vote would be taken between Statehood and Commonwealth    115  The United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization passed a resolution and adopted a consensus text introduced by Cuba s delegate on June 20  2011  calling on the United States to expedite a process  that would allow Puerto Ricans to fully exercise their inalienable right to self determination and independence    104  In October 2011  Governor Luis Fortu o set August 12  2012 to hold the first part of a two step status plebiscite  If a second status vote is required  it will take place on the same day as the general election in November 6  2012  he added  citation needed  The first referendum will ask voters whether they want to maintain the current commonwealth status under the territorial clause of the U S  Constitution or whether they prefer a nonterritorial option  citation needed  If more voters check that nonterritorial option  a second vote would be held giving people three status options  statehood  independence or free association  116  A bill was brought before the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico in 2011 to effect the governor s proposal  The bill passed on 28 December 2011  Both referendums  however  will be held on a single ballot on 6 November 2012  117  Geography Main article  Geography of Puerto Rico See also  Geology of Puerto Rico and Fauna of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico consists of the main island of Puerto Rico and various smaller islands  including Vieques  Culebra  Mona  Desecheo  and Caja de Muertos  Of these last five  only Culebra and Vieques are inhabited year round  Mona is uninhabited most of the year except for employees of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources  There are also many other even smaller islands including Monito and  La Isleta de San Juan  which includes Old San Juan and Puerta de Tierra and is connected to the main island by bridges  Map of Puerto Rico The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has an area of 13 790 square kilometers  5 320 sq mi   of which 8 870 km2  3 420 sq mi  is land and 4 921 km2  1 900 sq mi  is water  118  The maximum length of the main island from east to west is 180 km  110 mi   and the maximum width from north to south is 65 km  40 mi   119  Puerto Rico is the smallest of the Greater Antilles  It is 80  of the size of Jamaica  120  just over 18  of the size of Hispaniola and 8  of the size of Cuba  the largest of the Greater Antilles  121  Puerto Rico is mostly mountainous with large coastal areas in the north and south  The main mountain range is called  La Cordillera Central   The Central Range   The highest elevation in Puerto Rico  Cerro de Punta 1 339 meters  4 393 ft   118  is located in this range  Another important peak is El Yunque  one of the highest in the Sierra de Luquillo at the El Yunque National Forest  with an elevation of 1 065 m  3 494 ft   122  Puerto Rico has 17 lakes  all man made  and more than 50 rivers  most originating in the Cordillera Central  123  Rivers in the northern region of the island are typically longer and of higher water flow rates than those of the south  since the south receives less rain than the central and northern regions  Coast scene at Patillas  Puerto Rico Puerto Rico is composed of Cretaceous to Eocene volcanic and plutonic rocks  overlain by younger Oligocene and more recent carbonates and other sedimentary rocks  124  Most of the caverns and karst topography on the island occurs in the northern region in the carbonates  The oldest rocks are approximately 190 million years old  Jurassic  and are located at Sierra Bermeja in the southwest part of the island  They may represent part of the oceanic crust and are believed to come from the Pacific Ocean realm  Puerto Rico lies at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates and is being deformed by the tectonic stresses caused by their interaction  These stresses may cause earthquakes and tsunamis  These seismic events  along with landslides  represent some of the most dangerous geologic hazards in the island and in the northeastern Caribbean  The most recent major earthquake occurred on October 11  1918  and had an estimated magnitude of 7 5 on the Richter scale  125  It originated off the coast of Aguadilla and was accompanied by a tsunami  The Puerto Rico Trench  the largest and deepest trench in the Atlantic  is located about 115 km  71 mi  north of Puerto Rico at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates  126  It is 280 km  170 mi  long  127  At its deepest point  named the Milwaukee Deep  it is almost 8 400 m  27 600 ft  deep  or about 5 2 miles  126  The island experiences frequent tremors and is an area of concern for major earthquakes  citation needed  Located in the tropics  Puerto Rico has an average temperature of 82 4  F  28  C  throughout the year with an average minimum temperature of 66 9  F  19  C  and maximum of 85 4  F  30  C   Temperatures do not change drastically throughout the seasons  The temperature in the south is usually a few degrees higher than the north and temperatures in the central interior mountains are always cooler than the rest of the island  The Hurricane season spans from June to November  The all time low in Puerto Rico has been 39  F  4  C   registered in Aibonito  128  The average yearly precipitation is 1687mm  129  Species endemic to the archipelago are 239 plants  16 birds and 39 amphibians reptiles  recognized as of 1998  Most of these  234  12 and 33 respectively  are found on the main island  130  The most recognizable endemic species and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride is the Coqu   a small frog easily identified by the sound of its call  and from which it gets its name  Most Coqu  species  13 of 17  live in the El Yunque National Forest  a tropical rainforest in the northeast of the island previously known as the Caribbean National Forest  El Yunque is home to more than 240 plants  26 of which are endemic to the island  It is also home to 50 bird species  including the critically endangered Puerto Rican Amazon  Across the island in the southwest  the 40 km2  15 sq mi  of dry land at the Gu nica Commonwealth Forest Reserve 131  contain over 600 uncommon species of plants and animals  including 48 endangered species and 16 endemic to Puerto Rico  Administrative divisions Main article  Municipalities of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico s municipalities As an unincorporated territory of the United States  Puerto Rico does not have any first order administrative divisions as defined by the U S  Government  but there are 78 municipalities at the secondary level which function as counties  Municipalities are further subdivided into barrios  and those into sectors  Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected for four year terms  The first municipality  previously called  town   of Puerto Rico  San Juan  was founded in 1521  In the 16th century two more municipalities were established  San Germ n  1570  and Coamo  1579   Three more municipalities were established in the 17th century  These were Arecibo  1614   Aguada  1692  and Ponce  1692   The 18th and 19th century saw an increase in settlement in Puerto Rico with 30 municipalities being established in the 18th century and 34 more in the 19th century  Only six municipalities were founded in the 20th century with the last  Florida  being founded in 1971  72  Economy Main article  Economy of Puerto Rico Pharmaceutical companies around Puerto Rico Milla de Oro is a major financial center in Puerto Rico  In the early 20th century the greatest contributor to Puerto Rico s economy was agriculture and its main crop was sugar  In the late 1940s a series of projects codenamed Operation Bootstrap encouraged a significant shift to manufacture via tax exemptions  Manufacturing quickly replaced agriculture as the main industry of the island  Puerto Rico is classified as a  high income country  by the World Bank  132  133  Economic conditions have improved dramatically since the Great Depression because of external investment in capital intensive industries such as petrochemicals  pharmaceuticals and technology  Once the beneficiary of special tax treatment from the U S  government  today local industries must compete with those in more economically depressed parts of the world where wages are not subject to U S  minimum wage legislation  In recent years  some U S  and foreign owned factories have moved to lower wage countries in Latin America and Asia  Puerto Rico is subject to U S  trade laws and restrictions  Also  starting around 1950  there was heavy migration from Puerto Rico to the Continental United States  particularly New York City  in search of better economic conditions  Puerto Rican migration to New York displayed an average yearly migration of 1 800 for the years 1930 1940  31 000 for 1946 1950  45 000 for 1951 1960  and a peak of 75 000 in 1953  134  As of 2003  the U S  Census Bureau estimates that more people of Puerto Rican birth or ancestry live in the U S  than in Puerto Rico  135  On May 1  2006  the Puerto Rican government faced significant shortages in cash flows  which forced the closure of the local Department of Education and 42 other government agencies  All 1 536 public schools closed  and 95 762 people were furloughed in the first ever partial shutdown of the government in the island s history  136  On May 10  2006  the budget crisis was resolved with a new tax reform agreement so that all government employees could return to work  On November 15  2006  a 5 5  sales tax was implemented  Municipalities are required by law to apply a municipal sales tax of 1 5  bringing the total sales tax to 7   137  View of the La Concha  one of the newly refurbished hotels  from the beach in Condado Tourism is an important component of Puerto Rican economy supplying an approximate  1 8 billion  In 1999  an estimated 5 million tourists visited the island  most from the U S  Nearly a third of these are cruise ship passengers  A steady increase in hotel registrations since 1998 and the construction of new hotels and new tourism projects  such as the Puerto Rico Convention Center  indicate the current strength of the tourism industry  In 2009  tourism accounted for nearly 7  of the islands  gross national product  138  Puerto Ricans had median household income of  18 314 for 2009  which makes Puerto Rico s economy comparable to the independent nations of Latvia or Poland  139  By comparison  the poorest state of the Union  Mississippi  had median household income of  36 646 in 2009  139  Nevertheless  Puerto Rico s GDP per capita compares favorably to other independent Caribbean nations  and is one of the highest in North America  See List of North American countries by GDP per capita  Puerto Rico s public debt has grown at a faster pace than the growth of its economy  reaching  46 7 billion in 2008  140  In January 2009  Luis Fortu o enacted several measures aimed at eliminating the government s  3 3 billion deficit  141  including laying off 12 505 142  government employees  Puerto Rico s unemployment rate was 15 9 percent in January 2010  143  Some analysts said they expect the government s layoffs to propel that rate to 17 percent  144  In November 2010  Gov  Fortu o proposed a tax reform plan that would be implemented in a six year period  retroactive to January 1  2010  The first phase  applicable to year 2010  reduces taxes to all individual taxpayers by 7 15   By year 2016  average relief for individual taxpayers will represent a 50  tax cut and a 30  cut for corporate taxpayers  whose tax rate will be lowered from 41 to 30   145  Businesses and consumers in Puerto Rico are subjected to economic discrimination by many U S  and multinational companies that limit access to products or offer them at higher prices to businesses and consumers located in Puerto Rico  For example  Apple does not include K 12 or post secondary educational institutions in their national pricing program offering discounts to teachers and students and special pricing for institutional purchases  146  Likewise  Minneapolis based Best Buy does not allow residents of Puerto Rico to purchase goods on their website  which may be purchased from the 50 states  Guam and the United States Virgin Islands  but invites potential customers to skirt their own rules   Now you can order items online and ship them to a U S  address    or pick them up at a U S  store  International orders may be shipped to street addresses in the U S   U S  Virgin Islands and Guam  along with AFO FPO mailing address   147  At the same time  the latest report by the President Task Force on Puerto Rico Status recognizes that the status question and the economy are intimately linked  Many participants in the forums conducted by the Task Force argued that uncertainty about status is holding Puerto Rico back in economic areas  And although there are a number of economic actions that should be taken immediately or in the short term  regardless of the ultimate outcome of the status question  identifying the most effective means of assisting the Puerto Rican economy depends on resolving the ultimate question of status  In short  the long term economic well being of Puerto Rico would be dramatically improved by an early decision on the status question  115  Demographics Main article  Demographics of Puerto Rico Racial and Ethnic Composition in Puerto Rico  2010 Census   148  Ethnics

or Latino  of any race  makes up 99 0 percent of the population  The population of Puerto Rico has been shaped by Amerindian settlement  European colonization  slavery  economic migration  and Puerto Rico s status as unincorporated territory of the United States  Population and racial makeup The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Puerto Rico was 3 706 690 on July 1  2011  a  0 51  decrease since the 2010 United States Census  5  Royal Decree of Graces  1815 Continuous European immigration during the 19th century helped the population grow from 155 000 in 1800 to almost a million at the close of the century  A census conducted by royal decree on September 30  1858 gives the following totals of the Puerto Rican population at this time  341 015 as Free colored  300 430 identified as Whites  and 41 736 were slaves  149  During the 19th century hundreds of Corsican  French  Lebanese  Chinese  and Portuguese families arrived in Puerto Rico  along with large numbers of immigrants from Spain  mainly from Catalonia  Asturias  Galicia  the Balearic Islands  Andalusia  and the Canary Islands  and numerous Spanish loyalists from Spain s former colonies in South America  Other settlers included Irish  Scots  Germans  Italians and thousands others who were granted land by Spain during the Real Cedula de Gracias de 1815   Royal Decree of Graces of 1815    which allowed European Catholics to settle in the island with land allotments in the interior of the island  provided they agreed to pay taxes and continue to support the Catholic Church  Between 1960 and 1990 the census questionnaire in Puerto Rico did not ask about race or color  However  the 2000 United States Census included a racial self identification question in Puerto Rico  According to the census  most Puerto Ricans self identified as White and few declared themselves to be Black or some other race  150  A recent study conducted in Puerto Rico suggests that around 52 6  of the population possess Amerindian mtDNA  151  152  Immigration and emigration Population density  Census 2000 Puerto Rico has recently become the permanent home of over 100 000 legal residents who immigrated from not only the Dominican Republic  but from other Latin American countries  These include Cuba  Colombia  and Venezuela  as well as surrounding Caribbean islands  Haiti  Barbados  and the American Virgin Islands among them  Emigration is a major part of contemporary Puerto Rican history  Starting soon after World War II  poverty  cheap airfare  and promotion by the island government caused waves of Puerto Ricans to move to the United States  particularly to New York  New Jersey  Massachusetts  and Florida  This trend continued even as Puerto Rico s economy improved and its birth rate declined  and Puerto Ricans continue to follow a pattern of  circular migration   Language Main article  Puerto Rican Spanish The official languages are Spanish and English with Spanish being the primary language  English is taught as a second language in public and private schools from elementary levels to high school and at the university level  The Spanish of Puerto Rico has evolved into having many idiosyncrasies in vocabulary and syntax which differentiate it from the Spanish spoken in other Spanish speaking countries  While the Spanish spoken in all Iberian  Mediterranean and Atlantic Spanish
