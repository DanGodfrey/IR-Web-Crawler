was introduced into the X Men title as a the result of an editorial dictate that the book was supposed to depict a school for mutants  1 Uncanny X Men artist John Byrne named Kitty Pryde after a classmate he met in art school  Alberta College of Art and Design in Calgary in 1973  He had told Pryde that he liked her name and asked for permission to use it  promising to name his first original comics character after her  2  Byrne had drawn the character to slightly resemble an adolescent Sigourney Weaver  3  The fictional Kitty Pryde first appeared in Uncanny X Men  129  Jan  1980   by writer Chris Claremont and artist Byrne  as a highly intelligent 13 year old girl  Claremont said several elements of the character s personality were derived from those of X Men editor Louise Simonson s daughter  Julie  4  Claremont and Byrne made the new character a full fledged X Man in issue  139  where she was codenamed  Sprite   She was the main character in the issues  141 142  the  Days of Future Past  storyline  where she is possessed by her older self  who time travels into the past to prevent the mass extermination of mutants  The six issue miniseries Kitty Pryde and Wolverine  1984 1985   written by Claremont  was a coming of age storyline in which she matures from a girl to a young woman and adopts the new name  Shadowcat   Shadowcat s popularity had a profound effect on the real life Kitty Pryde  the latter became so overwhelmed by attention from Shadowcat fans after the publication of the X Men comics that she abbreviated her name to K D  Pryde to avoid association with her fictional counterpart  She has since stated that she has mixed feelings about her fame  saying that she values Byrne s comics for their entertainment and artistic value  but wishes that more people would appreciate her as more than just Shadowcat s namesake  2   edit  Fictional character biography   Whether to make the  reason  mandatory for the   cleanup   template is

descent  her paternal grandfather  Samuel Prydeman  was held in a Nazi concentration camp during World War II  Kitty started to have headaches at age thirteen  signaling the emergence of her mutant powers  She was approached by both the X Men s Charles Xavier and the Hellfire Club s White Queen  Emma Frost  both of whom hoped to recruit her for their respective causes  Kitty was unnerved by Frost  observing that the White Queen had looked at her as if she were  something good to eat   She got along better with Xavier and the three X Men who escorted him to his meeting with her and her parents  becoming fast friends with Ororo Munroe  Ororo told Kitty who she really was and about the X Men  which made the teenager even more enthusiastic about attending Xavier s school  Their conversation was cut short  however  when they  along with Wolverine and Colossus  were attacked by armored mercenaries in the employ of Frost and the Hellfire Club  The X Men defeated their assailants  but were subdued by the White Queen s telepathic powers immediately after  In the confusion  Kitty had become separated from the X Men and therefore was not captured along with them  5  She managed to contact Cyclops  Phoenix  and Nightcrawler  6  With the help of Dazzler and Pryde  those X Men rescued their teammates and Xavier  who had also been captured  from the Hellfire Club  7  The White Queen appeared to perish in the battle  which meant she was no longer competing with Xavier for the approval of Kitty s parents  Unfortunately  Kitty s parents hadn t heard from her in more than a day  because during that time she was first being pursued by the Hellfire Club s men and then working with the X Men to save their friends  All they knew was that Kitty had left with Xavier s  students  to get a soda  there had been reports that the soda shop had been blown up  and that Kitty had been missing since  Understandably  they were angry at Xavier when he finally returned with Kitty in tow  At first  it seemed like there was no chance of Kitty being allowed to attend the school and join the X Men  Phoenix then decided to use her considerable telepathic power to erase the memories of Kitty s parents and plant false ones  resulting in a complete shift in their attitude towards Xavier  Questions concerning the morality of tampering with minds in such a fashion aside  Kitty was then allowed to enroll at Xavier s school with her parents  blessing  She was the youngest person to join the X Men up to that point   edit  Joining the X Men Shadowcat as member of Excalibur with Lockheed and Widget  Art by Alan Davis Kitty joined the X Men  8  and assumed the costumed identity of Sprite  9  Early in her career as an X Man  Kitty s adult self from an alternate future took possession of her body in the present to help X Men thwart the assassination of Senator Robert Kelly by the second Brotherhood of Evil Mutants  10  Kitty then singlehandedly defeated a N Garai demon  11  Kitty also briefly attended the White Queen s Massachusetts Academy when her parents became convinced that she needed to be with students of her own age  but following a failed attempt to subdue the X Men  Frost revoked Kitty s admission  12  During her teen years  Kitty fostered a number of close relationships with others at the school and in the X Men  She developed a crush on Colossus and became close friends with his little sister Illyana Rasputin  Initially uneasy around Nightcrawler and other mutants with physical deformities  Kitty finally overcame her fears and became close friends with him  Kitty also befriended Lockheed  a highly intelligent alien resembling a dragon  13  who followed her home after a mission in outer space  14  Lockheed is extremely loyal to Kitty  and the two of them share a psychic bond  Wolverine became something of a mentor to Kitty despite his usually gruff personality  Storm came to view Kitty as the daughter she never had  Kitty was later assigned to the New Mutants  15  a team of younger mutants established in the absence of the X Men while they were in outer space  Kitty convinced Professor Xavier to allow her to remain a full member of the X Men on the basis of her high intelligence  maturity  and the fact that she was already a fully trained member of the team  Kitty was later abducted by the Morlocks and nearly forced to wed Caliban  16  She was then abducted by the White Queen  but rescued by the New Mutants  17  During this time  Kitty began to  date  Colossus  but this did not last long  Colossus developed feelings for an alien woman named Zsaji whom he met on the Beyonder s planet in the first Secret Wars  Colossus  feelings toward Zsaji were primarily a side effect of her own unique healing abilities  which she had used on him after he became injured  Regardless  Colossus  feelings were real and he returned to Earth consumed with grief after Zsaji s death  He admitted to Kitty that he loved Zsaji  which hurt her deeply and ended the budding romantic relationship  18  Kitty had made good friends with a local boy from Salem Central named Doug Ramsey around this time  but her feelings for him never went as deep as his for her  and they never actually dated  though they remained close  even more so after Doug s status as a mutant was revealed and he joined the New Mutants under the codename Cypher  They remained friends until his death some time later   edit  Ogun During the 1985 Kitty Pryde and Wolverine miniseries  Kitty is possessed by a demon  the ninja Ogun  Ogun psychically bestows upon Kitty a virtual lifetime of martial arts training  Kitty was brainwashed by Ogun into becoming a ninja assassin  and was sent to attack Wolverine  Kitty is able to resist Ogun s influence with Wolverine s help  and the two form a strong teacher student bond  which helps them in vanquishing Ogun  Kitty returns to the X Men  no longer the innocent girl they once knew  and officially adopts the codename Shadowcat  19   edit  Morlock Massacre While trying to save Rogue  Kitty was badly injured by Harpoon s energy spear during the Mutant Massacre story arc  in the massacre of the Morlocks  with the result that she lost control of her power and was stuck in an intangible state and could not regain her solidity  20  She was rushed to Muir Island along with other surviving casualties of the Massacre to be tended to by Moira MacTaggert  MacTaggert was able to keep Kitty s condition from deteriorating to the point where she completely lost physical substance and ceased to exist  but wasn t able to do any more to help her  volume  amp  issue needed  At this time  Kitty s natural state was to be intangible  Where she once had to make a conscious effort to phase  she could now only maintain her solidity through an act of conscious will  The X Men went to Reed Richards  Mister Fantastic of the Fantastic Four  for aid  but Richards initially refused because he was not sure he would be able to help  Reed was in a struggle with the rest of the Fantastic Four about their origins  They thought that Reed deliberately caused their accident which turned them into the Fantastic Four  thus making him very uncertain about his personal motives and abilities   21  Having nowhere else to go  the X Men turned to Richards  enemy Doctor Doom  This created a moral dilemma for both the X Men and the Fantastic Four  and both teams fought each other because the Fantastic Four were trying to stop the treatment while the X Men were determined to save Kitty s life  In the end  both the personal crisis of the Fantastic Four and the life of Shadowcat were saved after Franklin Richards  with the help of Lockheed  brought both teams to their senses  22  Kitty has since recovered from this state and now has full control over her power again  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Excalibur This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve

Isle were Colossus and Nightcrawler  although Colossus left the United Kingdom shortly after being released from MacTaggert s care to join the rest of the X Men on their mission to battle the Adversary  The X Men sacrificed their lives to defeat the Adversary  and the battle was televised and broadcast across the world  The X Men were resurrected later  unknown to the world at large  but chose to keep a low profile and perpetuate the belief that they were still dead  This strategy was enforced to more effectively fight their enemies  This meant avoiding contact with friends and family  including Kitty  Thinking the X Men were dead  Kitty and Nightcrawler joined Rachel Summers  Captain Britain  and Meggan to form the Britain based team Excalibur  23  For a brief time  Kitty studied at St  Searle s school for girls in Britain  24  During her time with Excalibur  Kitty developed a crush on Professor Alistaire Stuart which went unreciprocated since Alistaire was attracted to Rachel  Later  she was romantically involved with former Black Air agent Pete Wisdom  At some point  Kitty was recruited by the international law enforcement agency S H I E L D  to repair the computer system of their flying headquarters  Kitty discovered the problem was due to Ogun s spirit having infiltrated the computer system  and with the aid of Wolverine  she managed to purge Ogun s presence  25  During this time  Kitty was attracted to a S H I E L D  intern her own age  and this made her begin to doubt her relationship with Wisdom  Soon after  she broke off their relationship   edit  Back to the X Men After Excalibur s dissolution  Shadowcat  Nightcrawler  and Colossus return to the X Men  While returning  they faced a group of imposters following Cerebro  in the guise of Professor X  While tracking Mystique  she stumbles onto prophetic diaries that belonged to Irene Adler  a precognitive  During the six month gap  Kitty visited Genosha  Whatever she experienced there is unknown  although presumably connected to her father  living on Genosha at the time   but it had a profound effect on her  She cut her hair and began to act rebelliously  also using one of Wolverine s bone claws broken off during battle as a weapon  Kitty remained with the X Men for a while before leaving after the apparent death of Colossus  Trying to give herself a normal life  she attended the University of Chicago  During this time  her father was killed when Cassandra Nova s Sentinels destroyed Genosha  Kitty later finds a recording of his death due to exploring footage of the attack  She is also kidnapped by William Stryker  but the X Treme X Men team helped her escape and she assisted them on several missions  This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Shadowcat and Colossus on the cover of Astonishing X Men  6  Art by John Cassaday  At the start of Joss Whedon s run on Astonishing X Men  Kitty once again rejoins the X Men  despite having extreme reservations about working with the former White Queen  given their history  However  this was the primary reason why Frost herself wanted Kitty on the team  as a sort of  safety  should Frost ever revert to type  Frost reasoned that the person who trusted her least would be most likely to spot such behavior  On one of the team s first missions  Shadowcat discovered Colossus was alive  After some initial awkwardness  Kitty and Peter resumed dating  Kitty Pryde appeared alongside Colossus in the  Blinded by the Light  arc in X Men  They are the two X Men left to look after the students while the rest of the X Men leave for Mystique s home in Mississippi to check up on Rogue  during which they are ambushed by the Marauders  Kitty and Colossus  meanwhile  attempt to protect the students from a faction of the Marauders led by Exodus  It is revealed over the course of the story that Kitty  worried of the Destiny Diaries  safety  devised a plan with Cyclops and Emma Frost to hide them and have Emma wipe the location from her mind  The location could only be revealed by a code word spoken to Kitty  The arc concludes with a battle between Iceman and Cannonball against the Marauders for the diaries  during which they are destroyed by Gambit  In the  Torn  arc  the latest incarnation of the Hellfire Club begin an assault on Xavier s School  Kitty fulfilled the role that Emma Frost envisioned  personally taking down Frost and imprisoning her  only to fall under a telepathic delusion created by Hellfire member Perfection  who claimed to be the true  unreformed Emma Frost  Under this delusion  Kitty was made to believe that she and Colossus had conceived a child  which was later taken away by the X Men because its potential mutant abilities were supposedly dangerous  Kitty reacts in the delusion by attempting to rescue the child from a near inescapable  box  in the depths of the school  unaware that in reality she is freeing an alien entity  Stuff  who contains the trapped consciousness of Cassandra Nova  the apparent ringleader of this new Hellfire Club  A newly awakened Cyclops revealed that the new Hellfire Club  including Perfection and Nova  are actually mental projections created by a piece of Cassandra Nova s consciousness  which became lodged in Emma s mind during the X Men s last confrontation with her  playing on her survivor s guilt over the Genoshan massacre  and utilizing Emma s telepathy to both confound the X Men and orchestrate her  Nova s  escape from the Stuff body  As Cyclops killed the mental projections  Emma tried to force Kitty to kill her to get rid of Nova  Undeterred  Cassandra Nova switched her focus to attempt to transfer her mind to Hisako Ichiki  It appears that Nova did not succeed  as the team was transported to S W O R D  s air station en route to Ord s Breakworld for the  Unstoppable  arc that concludes Whedon s run on Astonishing X Men   edit  Breakworld As the team prepares to end the confrontation with the Breakworld leader  the team splits up with Kitty on the team appointed to stop the missile pointed at Earth  Kitty phases into the missile to disrupt its circuitry noting that it is composed of the same material as the rest of Breakworld  a material that s difficult and exhausting for her to phase through  After phasing for a mile into the missile  Kitty finds the center only to discover it empty  The missile is fired  causing Kitty to pass out inside of it as Beast discovers too late that due to its shape  trajectory  and lack of internal circuitry  the Breakworld s weapon is not a missile  but a bullet  As the bullet hurtles toward Earth  Kitty lies unconscious within it  26  As the situation becomes increasingly dire  Emma establishes mental contact with Kitty  reassuring her that she will come out of this fine  though it eventually becomes clear to both that the situation will be grim  Kitty and Emma come to an understanding and reconciliation  Emma stating that she never wanted something like this to happen to her  Kitty then phases the bullet through Earth  but is trapped within  At the end of Giant Size Astonishing X Men  Scott Summers mentions that Doctor Strange  Reed Richards  and some  top men  tried to save her  but believe she has fused to the bullet  as it continues to hurtle through space  Whether she is alive or dead is unknown  though the X Men consider her lost to them  26  As a result of these events Kitty does not appear in the X Men crossover event X Men  Messiah Complex  since this takes place after the events of Giant Size Astonishing X Men  She is briefly mentioned in the aftermath of the Messiah Complex  by Colossus  Nightcrawler  and Wolverine  as the three of them discuss  losing her   27  To cope with Kitty s loss  Colossus takes down a group of Russian criminals dealing in human trafficking  and gets a tattoo of the name  Katya  on his chest  28  Emma begins having a recurring dream in which she hears a voice whom she believes is Kitty s trying to reach out to her  29  It was later confirmed by Abigail Brand that Kitty Pryde was still alive within the bullet  but because the bullet s design would harden as time went on  it would become increasingly difficult to break the bullet open  30   edit  Return After the X Men move to the island of Utopia  Magneto arrives on the island professing his desire to join and support the X Men in their effort to unite the world s remaining mutants  The X Men reluctantly let him stay  remaining wary of him despite his efforts to gain their trust  31  In a final bid to gain their trust  Magneto focuses his powers  attempting to divert the interstellar path of the metal bullet Kitty is trapped in and bring her home to Earth  Meanwhile inside the bullet  Kitty is revealed to still be alive  32  Unbeknownst to the others  Magneto had encountered the bullet earlier while attempting to regain his powers with the High Evolutionary and surmised that Kitty was inside  Despite this and the High Evolutionary s apparent ability to retrieve the bullet and Kitty  Magneto chose to focus on regaining his powers  secretly keeping tabs on the bullet until his decision to draw it back to Earth  During her time trapped inside the bullet  Kitty keeps herself and the bullet phased to avoid collisions with any inhabited objects in its path  Magneto brings her safely down to Earth  with the help of Doctor Strange  by cracking the bullet in two and levitating Kitty to the ground  However  when she and Colossus try to touch  it is revealed that she is trapped in her intangible form  unable to speak  and the X Men place her in a protective chamber similar to the one used for her following the events of the Mutant Massacre  33  34  How Kitty survived her time in the bullet is unclear to the X Men s science team  where the X Men discover that all her bodily functions halted  34  An analysis by Kavita Rao hypothesizes that Kitty created an intense muscle memory to keep herself and the bullet phased and has  forgotten  how to un phase  34  During a conversation with Colossus  with Emma Frost acting as the psi conduit  Kitty picks up Emma s stray thoughts on killing the captive Sebastian Shaw  to prevent Namor from discovering she previously lied to him  While disgusted at Emma s intentions  Kitty offers a compromise  Due to her current ghost state  she is the perfect tool for making Shaw disappear  35  In a storyline in Uncanny X Men  the Breakworlders make their way to Earth  During the conflict between the Breakworlder Kr uun and the X Men  Kitty is slain and resurrected by Kr uun s mate in an alien ritual  which results in her powers returning to normal  36   edit  Regenesis Sometime after  towards the end of the SCHISM  Kitty decides to return with Wolverine to Westchester to open the Jean Grey School for the Gifted  37  In Wolverine and the X Men  4  she discovered that she is pregnant of 8 months  The pregnancy was revealed to be a Brood infestation  and it was swiftly dealt with by a team of X Men  volume  amp  issue needed  Since returning to Westchester  Kitty has shared several kisses with Iceman  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Relationship with Colossus Kitty expressed a romantic interest in Colossus early into her time with the X Men  This did not sit well with Marvel Comics  editor in chief at the time  Jim Shooter  who disapproved of the suggestion that a 19 year old was sleeping with a 14 year old girl  38  Kitty had in fact directly propositioned Colossus in Uncanny X Men  165  when they were both infected with Brood embryos and seemingly doomed to die  Kitty  aware of the taboo of their relationship  made the plea that if she were older it would not be a problem  but Colossus refused   offering only a passionate kiss   saying  However  little one  you are not older   This did not stop the relationship from continuing  as the two were spotted once again kissing in an apparent formalization of their involvement  39  Shooter finally brought an end to the budding relationship in his Secret Wars limited series  in which Colossus developed feelings for an alien woman named Zsaji while on the Beyonder s Battleworld  40  Zsaji was a healer whose powers had a side effect of infatuation  For Colossus  this infatuation furthered his doubts of his feelings for Kitty due to his jealousy of her friendship with Doug Ramsey and led to a passionate  albeit brief relationship with Zsaji  After Zsaji s death  Colossus found he no longer had feelings for Kitty  and upon returning to Earth  he would break up with her  41  The two remained friends  though much cooler around each other until they were separated when Colossus was among the X Men killed in Dallas during Fall of the Mutants  While a member of Excalibur  Kitty exploited her closeness with Colossus after he joined the Acolytes by luring him to Muir Island under the pretense of wanting to join him on Avalon  Actually  it was a ruse to allow Professor X to heal a head injury Colossus had suffered which they assumed had led to his defection  Kitty disliked betraying him  but went along with the ruse and was forgiven for her part in it  42  After the fall of Avalon  Colossus came to Muir Island looking for Kitty  and upon finding her with Pete Wisdom  he attacked and seriously injured Wisdom  The two talked about their past and decided to become close friends  with Colossus carefully watching over her relationship with Wisdom  After Kitty and Wisdom s romantic relationship ends  she rejoins the X Men with Colossus and Nightcrawler  and the two remain close  Kitty was not among the team when Colossus sacrificed himself to cure the Legacy Virus  but she returned to claim his ashes and spread them in his homeland  43  After Colossus  resurrection in Joss Whedon s run on Astonishing X Men  the two discuss their feelings and consummate the relationship  44  During the events of Fear Itself after numerous failed attempts to stop the Norse powered Juggernaut Cain Marko  Shadowcat goes on a mission with Magik and Colossus to Cytorrak s dimension to try to convince him to stop using Cain Marko as the avatar of the Juggernaut  Cytorrak accepts on the terms that one of them become his new avatar  which Colossus takes to prevent his sister from carrying the burden  volume  amp

Powers and abilities Kitty is a mutant with the ability to pass through solid matter by passing her atoms through the spaces between the atoms of the object through which she is moving  In this way she and the object through which she is passing can temporarily merge without interacting  and each is unharmed when Shadowcat has finished passing through the object  This process is called  phasing   and it renders her almost completely intangible to physical touch  Shadowcat passes through objects at the same speed at which she is moving before she enters them  Since she is unable to breathe while inside an object  she can only continuously phase through solid objects  as when she travels underground  as long as she can hold her breath  However  contrary depictions of the duration of her phasing ability have been presented  such as when she has phased miles within an object  The use of her abilities also interferes with any electrical systems as she passes through by disrupting the flow of electrons from atom to atom  including the bio electric systems of living bodies if she concentrates in the right way  46  This typically causes machines to malfunction or be destroyed as she phases through them  and can induce shock and unconsciousness in living beings  Using her power began as an optional ability  but for a period  over ten years of published comics  approximately two years in continuity  Kitty existed in a naturally  phased  state  and had to consciously choose to become solid  However  she has now returned to her original form  i e  she is now naturally solid and must choose when to use her power  47  While phasing  she does not physically walk on surfaces  but rather interacts with the molecules of air above them  allowing her to ascend and descend  causing her to seemingly walk on air  While phased  she is immune to most physical attacks  and has inconsistent showings of some resistance to telepathy  The density of some materials  such as adamantium  can prove deleterious to her phasing  causing her to be severely disoriented or experience pain if she tries to pass through them  48  Some energy attacks also prove problematic for Kitty  For example  an energy blast fired by Harpoon  a member of the Marauders caused her to lose her ability to become fully tangible for months  Magic and magical beings can also harm her in her phased state  as demonstrated in a battle with a N Garai demon whose claws left no visible marks  but caused Kitty severe pain as they passed through her intangible body  Kitty can also extend her powers to phase other people and objects  Currently  she is able to phase at least a half a dozen other people  or objects of similar mass  with her  so long as they establish and maintain physical contact with her  She can extend her phasing effect to her own clothing or any other object with mass up to that of a small truck  as long as she remains in contact with it  Kitty can also make objects intangible by maintaining contact with them  She has threatened to leave people phased into a wall and used her power offensively to harm the Technarch Magus and Danger  Kitty s powers seem to have increased over the years  During an X Treme X Men story arc where she is kidnapped by Reverend William Stryker  she phases out of sync with Earth s rotation to move from one place in the world  only east or west  to another seemingly instantaneously  At the climax of Astonishing X Men  Kitty phases a 10 mi  16 km  long  bullet  composed of super dense alien metals through the entire planet Earth  This is her greatest phasing feat to date  causing her considerable strain  but she is unable to phase out of the bullet  It has been suggested that depending on the density of the person or object moved  she would be able to incinerate a person or object by dragging it to the center of the earth and leaving it there  volume  amp  issue needed  Besides her mutant powers  Kitty is a genius in the field of applied technology and computer science  She is highly talented in the design and use of computer hardware  She is a skilled pilot of piston and jet engine aircraft  and a competent pilot of certain advanced interstellar vehicles  She has previously shown a unique ability to wield the Soulsword and also be harmed by it  Since her possession by the ninja demon Ogun  she has been consistently shown to be an excellent hand to hand combatant  having since been endowed with a lifetime of training in the martial arts of Japanese ninja and samurai  such as aikido  karate  and ninjutsu  She is also trained in the Israeli martial art of Krav Maga  She is a professional level dancer in both ballet and modern dance  She speaks fluent English  Japanese  Russian  and the royal and standard languages
