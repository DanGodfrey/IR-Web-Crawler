Aquaman is a fictional character  a superhero who appears in comic books published by DC Comics  Created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger  the character debuted in More Fun Comics  73  Sep  1941   1  Initially a backup feature in DC s anthology titles  Aquaman later starred in several volumes of a solo title  During the late 1950s and 1960s superhero revival period known as the Silver Age  he was a founding member of the Justice League of America  In the 1990s Modern Age  Aquaman s character became more serious than in most previous interpretations  with storylines depicting the weight of his role as king of Atlantis  2  Later accounts reconciled both facets of the character  casting Aquaman as serious and broody  saddled with an ill reputation and struggling to find a true role and purpose beyond his public side as a deposed king and a fallen hero  3  Contents 1 Fictional character biography 1 1 Golden Age 1 2 Silver Age 1 2 1 Allies and foes 1 2 2 End of an Era 1 3 Modern Age 1

character biography  edit  Golden Age Main article  Golden Age of Comics The Golden Age Aquaman communicating with sea life by an ancient Atlantean temple he uses as his lair  from More Fun Comics  83  Nov  1942   Art by Louis Cazeneuve  Aquaman s first origin story was presented in flashback from his debut  narrated by the character himself    The story must start with my father  a famous undersea explorer   if I spoke his name  you would recognize it  My mother died when I was a baby  and he turned to his work of solving the ocean s secrets  His greatest discovery was an ancient city  in the depths where no other diver had ever penetrated  My father believed it was the lost kingdom of Atlantis  He made himself a water tight home in one of the palaces and lived there  studying the records and devices of the race s marvelous wisdom  From the books and records  he learned ways of teaching me to live under the ocean  drawing oxygen from the water and using all the power of the sea to make me wonderfully strong and swift  By training and a hundred scientific secrets  I became what you see   a human being who lives and thrives under the water    In his early Golden Age appearances  Aquaman could breathe underwater with gills  had superhuman strength enabling him to swim at high speeds  and could communicate with sea life and have them do his bidding  Initially  he was depicted as speaking to sea creatures  in their own language  rather than telepathically  and only when they were close enough to hear him  While he was often described as the  sovereign of the sea   with the waters of the entire globe his  domain   and almost every sea creature his  loyal subject   the title was never an official one  Aquaman s adventures took place all across the world  and his base was  an ancient temple of lost Atlantis  kept underwater   in which he kept a solitary throne  4  During his wartime adventures  most of Aquaman s foes were Nazi U boat commanders and various Axis villains  The rest of his adventures in the 1940s and 1950s had him dealing with various sea based criminals  including modern day pirates such as his longtime archenemy Black Jack  as well as various threats to aquatic life  shipping lanes  and sailors   edit  Silver Age Main article  Silver Age of Comics Starting in 1959  Aquaman s backstory was revised  with various new supporting characters added and several adjustments made to the character  his origins  his powers  and persona  In Adventure Comics  260  May 1959  and subsequent Silver Age comics  it was revealed that Aquaman was Arthur Curry  the son of Tom Curry  a lighthouse keeper  and Atlanna  a water breathing outcast from the lost  underwater city of Atlantis  Due to his heritage  Aquaman discovered as a youth that he possessed various superhuman abilities  including the powers of surviving underwater  communication with sea life  and tremendous swimming prowess  Eventually  Arthur decided to use his talents to become the defender of the Earth s oceans  It was later revealed that he had  in his youth  adventured as Aquaboy and met Superboy  Earth s only other publicly active superpowered hero at the time  on one occasion  5  When Arthur grew up  he called himself  Aquaman   It was later revealed that after Atlanna s death  Tom Curry met and married an ordinary human woman and had a son named Orm Curry  Aquaman s half brother  Orm grew up as a troubled youth in the shadow of his brother  who constantly bailed him out of trouble with the law  He grew to hate Aquaman not only for the powers that he could never possess but also because he believed that their father would always favor Aquaman  Orm disappeared after becoming an amnesiac and would resurface years later as Aquaman s archnemesis  Ocean Master  6  Aquaman s ability to talk with fish eventually expanded to full fledged telepathic communication with sea creatures even from great distances and he was also retroactively developed a specific weakness akin to Superman s vulnerability to kryptonite or Green Lantern s vulnerability to the color yellow  Aquaman had to come into contact with water at least once per hour  or he would die  prior to this story Aquaman could exist both in and out of water indefinitely  7   edit  Allies and foes Aquaman was included in the Justice League of America comic book series  appearing with the team in their very first adventure  8  and was also a founding member of the team  9  Aquaman took part in most of the 1960s adventures of the superhero team  Aquaman s supporting cast and rogues gallery soon began to grow with the addition of Aqualad  an outcast  orphaned youth from an Atlantean colony whom Aquaman takes in and begins to mentor  10  Aquaman later discovered the submerged fictional city of New Venice  11  which was later revealed to be based in Florida  volume  amp  issue needed  and which also became Aquaman s base of operations for a time  12  Aquaman was recognized as the son of Atlanna and was later voted to be the King after the death of the former regent  who had no heirs  13  By this time Aquaman had met Mera  14  a queen from a water based dimension  and married her shortly after he had become king  15  They soon had a son  Arthur  Jr   nicknamed  Aquababy    16  The 1960s series introduced other such archenemies as the Ocean Master  Aquaman s amnesiac half brother Orm   17 Black Manta  18  the Fisherman  19  the Scavenger  20  and the terrorist organization known as O G R E   21  Other recurring members of the Aquaman cast introduced in this series include the well meaning but annoying Quisp  a water sprite   22 Dr  Vulko  a trustworthy Atlantean scientist who became Aquaman s royal advisor and whom Aquaman eventually appoints to be king after leaving the throne himself  23  and Tula  known as  Aquagirl    an Atlantean princess who was Aqualad s primary love interest  24  After becoming king of Atlantis  Aquaman began a policy of

End of an Era In the mid 1980s  after his own feature s demise  Aquaman was briefly made the leader of the Justice League of America  In a storyline told in Justice League of America  228 230  an invasion of Earth by a race of Martians occurred at a time when the core members were missing  Aquaman was thus forced to defend Earth with a League much depleted in power and capability  and he took it upon himself to disband the Justice League altogether in Justice League of America Annual  2  1984   thereafter reforming it with new bylaws requiring members to give full participation to the League s cases  With the help of Martian Manhunter  Zatanna  and Elongated Man  veteran Justice League members willing to fully commit to the team  Aquaman recruited and trained four new and untried members  Gypsy  Vibe  Vixen  and Steel  also relocating the team s headquarters to a reinforced bunker in Detroit  Michigan after the destruction of the JLA s satellite headquarters during the invasion  25  Aquaman s participation in this new version of the Justice League ended in  243  Oct  1985   when he resigned to work on his marriage with Mera   edit  Modern Age The deep blue camouflage costume  from Aquaman vol  2   1  Feb  1986   Art by Craig Hamilton  After the 1985 Crisis on Infinite Earths limited series  several short limited series were produced in the late 1980s and early 1990s   beginning with 1986 s four issue Aquaman  Feb    May 1986   written by Neal Pozner  featuring Aquaman in a new  largely deep sea blue  costume  The series was well received and a follow up limited series was in the works  though it was eventually canceled due to creative problems  26  This series also expanded on several details of the Silver Age Aquaman s origin as well as Aquaman s relationship with his half brother  Ocean Master  whose origin was retold in more complete detail  The series also added mystical elements to Aquaman s mythology and reinvented Ocean Master as a sorcerer  Aquaman reappeared in his blue costume in the Aquaman Special  1  1988   In late 1988  the character appeared in the Invasion  crossover  guest starring with the Doom Patrol  again in the orange and green costume   edit  Retelling origins In 1989  the Legend of Aquaman Special  officially titled as Aquaman Special  1 in the comic s legal indicia  the second Special in back to back years  rewrote Aquaman s mythos and origin  though keeping most of his Silver Age history intact  The special was by writer Robert Loren Fleming  with plots breakdown art by Keith Giffen and full pencil art by artist Curt Swan  The Modern Age Aquaman is born as Orin to Queen Atlanna and the mysterious wizard Atlan in the Atlantean city of Poseidonis  As a baby  he was abandoned on Mercy Reef  which is above sea level at low tide  causing exposure to air which would be fatal to Atlanteans  because of his blond hair  which was seen by the superstitious Atlanteans as a sign of a curse they called  the Mark of Kordax   The only individual who spoke up on Orin s behalf was Vulko  a scientist who had no patience for myth or superstition  While his pleas fell on deaf ears  Vulko would later become a close friend and advisor to the young Orin  As a feral child who raised himself in the wilds of the ocean with only sea creatures to keep him company  Orin was found and taken in by a lighthouse keeper named Arthur Curry who named Orin  Arthur Curry  after himself  One day  Orin returned home and found that his adoptive father had disappeared  so he set off on his own  In his early teens  Orin ventured to the far north  where he met and fell in love with an Inupiat girl named Kako  He also first earned the hatred of Orm  the future Ocean Master who was later revealed to be Arthur s half brother by Atlan and an Inupiat woman  Time and Tide  no  4   Orin was driven away before he could learn that Kako had become pregnant with his son  Koryak  Orin then returned to the seas mostly staying out of humanity s sight  until he discovered Poseidonis  He was captured by the city s then dictatorial government and placed in a prison camp  where he met Vulko  also a prisoner of the state  who taught Orin the language and ways of the Atlanteans  While Orin was there  he realized that his mother was also being held captive  but after her death he broke out and fled  Eventually  he made his way to the surface world  where under the name of  Aquaman  he became one of several superheroes emerging into the public view at the time  Upon his return to Poseidonis  he was made the king  and sometime later he met and married Mera  The Modern Age Aquaman s history is nearly identical to that of the Silver Age Aquaman from this point on  As detailed in the five issue Aquaman limited series  June   Oct  1989   by the same creative team of the 1989 special of Robert Loren Fleming  Keith Giffen  and Curt Swan   which continued a few of the themes from the Legend of Aquaman Special  Mera was eventually driven insane by grief over the death of Arthur  Jr   and was committed to an asylum in Poseidonis  Shortly afterwards  an alien force conquered Atlantis  Arthur was forced to save the city but was hampered by an escaped Mera who personally blamed Arthur for the death of their son  In a fit of rage  Mera left Aquaman s dimension  The publication of writer Peter David s The Atlantis Chronicles  1 7  March   Sept  1990   which told the story of Atlantis from antediluvian times to Aquaman s birth  successfully revived interest in the character introduced the ancient Atlantean characters Orin  after whom Aquaman was named  and Atlan  who was revealed to be Aquaman s father   A new Aquaman ongoing series with creative team Shaun McLaughlin and Ken Hooper   1 13  thereafter ran from December 1991 to December 1992  which portrayed Aquaman reluctantly deciding to remain in Poseidonis as its protector once again  For a time  he served as Atlantis  representative to the United Nations but always found himself thrust back into the superhero role  Becoming more and more of a workaholic and solitary figure  Aquaman eventually returned to the oceans  He soon became tangled up in another attempt by Black Manta to destroy Atlantis by dragging it into a war with a surface nation  Peter David returned to the character in another limited series  Aquaman  Time and Tide  a 1993 1994 four issue series which further explained Aquaman s origins as he finally learned all about the history of his people through the Atlantis Chronicles  presented as historical texts passed down and updated through the centuries   Aquaman learned that his birth name was Orin and that he and his enemy Ocean Master shared the same father   an ancient Atlantean wizard  named Atlan  This revelation sent Orin into a bout of rage and depression  setting the stage for later confrontations between the two  as it was said in the Chronicles that  two brothers will also battle for control of Atlantis   the Silver Age Aquaman had always known that the Ocean Master was his half brother Orm  although Orm s amnesia prevented him from remembering that fact for some time   This series is credited by Kevin Melrose of Comic Book Resources with helping the character reach the height of his modern era popularity  27   edit  New direction The 1990s version of Aquaman  from Aquaman vol  5   17  Feb  1996   Art by Jim Calafiore  Aquaman received his own series again with the publication of the fifth Aquaman  1  Aug  1994   initially scripted by Peter David  following up on his 1993 Aquaman  Time and Tide limited series  This new Aquaman series was the longest running for the character  lasting until its 75th issue  David left the series after issue  46  July 1998  after working on it for nearly four years  David began by giving Aquaman an entirely new look  forsaking his former clean cut appearance  Following his discoveries reading the Atlantis Chronicles during the Time and Tide series  Aquaman withdraws from the world for a time  Garth finds him weeks later  with his hair and beard grown long  brooding in his cave  Soon after  vol  5   2  Sept  1994   Aquaman loses his left hand when the madman Charybdis steals his ability to communicate with sea life and sticks Arthur s hand into a piranha infested pool  This causes Aquaman to become somewhat unhinged  and he begins having prophetic dreams  and then  in need of a  symbol   attaches a harpoon spearhead to his left arm in place of his missing hand  His classic orange shirt is shredded in a battle with Lobo   4   and rather than replace it he goes topless for a while before donning a gladiatorial manica   5   After the destruction of the harpoon   8   Aquaman has it replaced with a cybernetic prosthetic from S T A R  Labs   9   This new harpoon has a retractable reel that he can fully control  A major storyline  culminating in  25  concerns the Five Lost Cities of Atlantis  Facing an unearthly invading species linked to the origin of the Atlanteans  Aquaman has to search out and unite the lost cities  This storyline establishes him as a Warrior King  and he becomes a major political power  ruling largely undisputed over all the Atlantean cities  The remainder of Peter David s run focused on Orin coming to terms with his genetic heritage and his role as a king  During this time he discovers the remnants of a sentient alien ship beneath Poseidonis  and is able to take control of it  returning Poseidonis to the surface and bringing Atlantis into greater contact with the outside world  The cultural changes this brings about  including increased tourism  as well as his conflicting duties as superhero and king  bring him into increasing tension with the political powers in his city  After a brief stint by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning  David was replaced as writer by Erik Larsen with issue  50  Dec  1998  and again by Dan Jurgens in issue  63  Jan  2000   the series ended with  75  Jan  2001   During this time his wife Mera returns  now sane again  from the otherworldly dimension where she had been trapped  and Aquaman narrowly averts a coup d  tat orchestrated by his son Koryak and his advisor Vulko  His second harpoon is also destroyed  this time in a battle with Noble  king of the Lurkers  he replaces it with a golden prosthetic hand developed by Atlantean scientists which can change shape at his command  thus retaining the powers of the harpoon but being more all purpose  After a brief war with an island nation  Aquaman expands Atlantis  surface influence by annexing the country to Atlantis   edit  Hiatus between series Aquaman had no regular series of his own from 2001 2003  but his plot went through several developments via his cameo appearances in several other titles  Aquaman had rejoined the JLA when it reformed 28  and remains an active  if sometimes reluctant member of that team until the Our Worlds at War event in 2001  shortly after the cancellation of Aquaman vol  5   during which Aquaman and the city of Poseidonis disappeared and were presumed to be destroyed during a confrontation between Aquaman and an Imperiex probe  In its place was simply a huge rift in the water of the ocean  with a vast spectral statue of Aquaman standing over it that the JLA installed as a holographic  beacon  to both warn ships away from the trench and provide a signal for the Atlanteans to use if they were ever able to find their way back  The Justice League eventually found that the city was still there  just magically shielded  but in ruins and apparently uninhabited  The Atlanteans were trapped in the ancient past  where Tempest had sent them as a last measure when it appeared that the city would be destroyed by the probe  There  however  they were enslaved by their own Atlantean ancestors  led by a powerful sorceress named Gamemnae  and Aquaman himself was transformed into living water and imprisoned in an ornamental pool  Over time  this civilization had collapsed until only Gamemnae herself  now immensely powerful  inhabited the ruins  After a few months of their time   but fully fifteen years for the Atlanteans   the JLA free Aquaman in  The Obsidian Age  storyline in JLA  29  Although the original League were killed by Gamemnae  their souls were contained by the magician Manitou Raven to use in a spell to contain Gamemnae in Atlantis until the present day  when he was able to resurrect them  With the aid of Nightwing  Hawkgirl  Firestorm  Zatanna and Manitou Raven  the first four being members of the  reserve JLA  that had been put together by an automatic program created by Batman that kicked in after the League vanished into the past  who had gone back in time with the aid of the Manitou Raven of their time   Aquaman is freed from his prison in the pool  Firestorm linking the pool to the ocean and Zatanna enhancing his powers so that he can now control the entire ocean as a water wraith  With this power  Aquaman is able to sever Gamemnae s connection to the city by sinking it under the sea again  While he fought Gamemnae  the League members returned the modern Atlanteans to the present where they could begin rebuilding the city  which in the present too was once again at the bottom of the sea   edit  Back to basics 2003 series  initial look by Yvel Guichet  A sixth Aquaman series began shortly afterwards  initially written by Rick Veitch who sought to take Aquaman in a more mystical direction  Subsequent writers who contributed to the series include John Ostrander  Will Pfeifer  Tad Williams  and John Arcudi  This series ran 57 issues starting in December 2002  cover dated February 2003   starting with  39  April 2006   following the events of Infinite Crisis  it was renamed Aquaman  Sword of Atlantis  Aquaman was blamed by his people for the initial decision to take them back in time  and sentenced to death  He escaped  and met the Lady of the Lake  who gave him a new prosthetic hand composed of mystical water with unusual properties  From there he gradually returned to his more traditional look orange shirt  short hair  and beardless but did not return to his city for several years  Later  Aquaman went to San Diego after a massive earthquake plunged half the city into the Pacific Ocean  He discovered that many people had survived the catastrophe  somehow gaining the ability to breathe underwater  and he began helping them to rebuild the submerged portion of the city they now called  Sub Diego   During this time  Aquaman picked up a new sidekick named Lorena  who eventually became the new Aquagirl  she was the only one of the Sub Diegans who retained the ability to breathe air as well as water  Aquaman s exile turned out to have been orchestrated by a sorcerer class who had come to power using knowledge gained in the Obsidian Age  after they were overthrown the city made overtures for him to return as their king  He declined  but for a time  it appeared that Aquaman might reconcile with Mera  as he attempted to take her to the surface in order to save her from the Atlantean mages who had transformed her into an air breather  As a metatextual nod to the positive reception of the new series  a scene in Grant Morrison s Seven Soldiers event shows Aquaman winning the  Best Comeback  award at a popular superhero convention  Shortly thereafter  during the Infinite Crisis event  Atlantis was destroyed by the Spectre  and many of its citizens were killed  including Aquaman s son Koryak and his oldest friend   and father figure   Vulko  Aquaman led the survivors to Sub Diego in the hope that the two displaced peoples could help each other  When Black Manta attacked the sunken city  Aquaman defeated him and left him for dead  surrounded by carnivorous fish  it was later revealed that Manta survived  although it remains unclear whether Aquaman intended his death    edit  The Missing Year through Final Crisis Following the One Year Later event  starting with Aquaman vol  6   40  May 2006   the series was renamed Aquaman  Sword of Atlantis and taken in an entirely different direction by writer Kurt Busiek  Aquaman is missing and presumed dead  A youth by the name of  Arthur Joseph Curry  is summoned by the mysterious Dweller in the Depths to take up the mantle of Aquaman  but it gradually emerges that the Dweller himself is Aquaman  having lost much of his memory and been strangely mutated  while gaining magical powers   See the Arthur Joseph Curry section  below   These changes were explained only later  during the  missing year  depicted in the weekly comic book 52  Aquaman makes a brief appearance at the memorial for Superboy  Sometime later Ralph Dibny  seemingly accompanied by Dr  Fate s helmet  meets a bearded  long haired  and amnesic Orin in the ruins of Atlantis  The helmet portends that  if he lives    if he lives    it is as a victim of the magicks of legend and the power of the sea   30  Orin had made a deal with the gods of the sea in a desperate bid to gain the power to save the lives of several Sub Diego inhabitants who had lost the ability to live in water  Using the bones of his severed left hand in a magical ritual  the sea gods gave Orin the power to raise Sub Diego onto dry land  However  Orin mutated into the  Dweller of the Depths   via the events of  WWIII  52 s Penultimate chapter  as a side effect of gaining his new abilities and lost his memories as a result  31  The fate he foresaw for Arthur Joseph Curry was a confused memory of his own past  In the midst of trying to help his successor  Orin was murdered  32  Upon the receipt of Orin s body  members of the Justice League of America  including Superman  Batman  Green Lantern  and the Flash  examine the body in Atlantis and wish the best for Mera and the new Aquaman  33  Orin seemingly reappears in Atlantis during the Final Crisis to fend off the forces of Darkseid  but the Aquaman that appeared is revealed to be from another Earth in the multiverse  34  35  The appearance of this Aquaman was later perceived by Hal Jordan and Barry Allen as an unsubstantiated rumor  since the Aquaman was never seen nor heard from again  36  Some time between his death and the beginning of Blackest Night  Orin s body was moved and buried on land at Mercy Reef alongside Tom Curry in accordance with his final wishes  37   edit  Blackest Night Main article  Blackest Night In Blackest Night  1  Garth returns to Atlantis and tells Orin s wife Mera that he is angry at the notion of

him to rise  37  Aquaman rises with Tula and Dolphin  demanding that Mera reunite with him in death  even offering a chance to see her son again   Garth is killed and joins the Black Lantern Corps  Mera fights back against Orin s reanimated corpse  denying that he s her husband  before fleeing  In the climax of Blackest Night  Aquaman was among those resurrected by The White Lantern Entity  and he was reunited with his wife  Because the Black Lantern Ring helped reconstruct Orin s body  when he was resurrected his hand was returned to him  38   edit  Brightest Day Main article  Brightest Day

husband and invites him to swim with her  but Arthur is hesitant  seeing only his Black Lantern form reflected back at him in the water  39  Later  he and Mera intercept a pirate vessel but finds that he can only call on dead sea life to help him  Boston Brand had been using his white ring to watch and is unable to explain how Aquaman was able to keep one of his Black Lantern abilities  40  While cleaning up an oil spill  Aquaman and Mera are attacked by soldiers from Mera s homeworld and leading them is Siren  Mera pulls Aquaman away from them and reveals that she was sent to kill him  41  She also hints that  despite the long lasting exile of her people  Xebel s soldiers had been enemies of Black Manta himself from a distant time  even preceding the first public appearance of Aquaman  and states that  despite Mera s original mission being a solo one  Siren is now backed by the entire Death Squad  elite Xebel soldiers  at the orders of the acting princess  Mera explains later that Siren is her younger sister  42  Aquaman is told by the Entity to find Jackson Hyde before a second unidentified group  43  Aquaman is about to start searching for Jackson when Mera claims that she knows who he is  44  After she tells him  Aquaman leaves to find Jackson on his own  sending Mera instead to get help because he needed time to mull all this new information over  He then rescues Jackson from a Xebel attack and it is revealed in conversation between the two that Aquaman s Silver Age origin has been re established and he is once again the half human son of Tom Curry and an Atlantean queen  45  While Aquaman repels the Xebel soldiers  the white ring brings Deadman to the beach were it reveals that it was the Entity that freed the Xebel soldiers from the Bermuda Triangle so that Aquaman could acknowledge the truth about Mera and Xebel  After the Xebel soldiers are sent back to the Bermuda Triangle  the Entity reduces Aquaman to what appears to be white water  46  When the Dark Avatar made his presence known  Aquaman is revealed to be part of the Elementals  Aquaman was transformed by the Entity to become the element of water and protect the Star City forest from the Dark Avatar  which appears to be the Black Lantern version of the Swamp Thing  47  The Elementals are then fused with the body of Alec Holland in order for him to be transformed by the Entity into the new Swamp Thing and battle against the Dark Avatar  After the Dark Avatar is defeated  Swamp Thing returned Aquaman to normal  Afterward  Aquaman is reunited with Mera  at which point he discovers that the Xebels  weapons were made of Atlantean technology  48   edit  The New 52 relaunch Announced during Orlando s MegaCon and later confirmed via Geoff Johns  official Twitter page  Ivan Reis and

issue  40  May 2006   The new developments include a new lead character  a new supporting cast  and the inclusion of sword and sorcery type fantasy elements in the series   edit  Fictional character biography While awaiting transport to Miami  Florida  a young man named Arthur Joseph Curry is washed out to sea when a storm ruptures the tank he is in  This Arthur Curry  whose origin closely resembles that of the Golden Age Aquaman as well as that of Neptune Perkins  is the son of oceanobiologist Dr  Phillip Curry  Arthur s mother  Elaine  died in childbirth and Dr  Curry was forced to use a mutagenic serum on his son when he was born three months premature  Arthur has lived his whole life in the main tank of his father s research facility at Avalon Cay  his only window to the outside world being television  Shortly after his arrival in the sea  Arthur is mentally contacted by the mysterious  Dweller of the Depths   a deformed humanoid with tentacles instead of hair and a left hand made of water  The Dweller urges him to help King Shark  who still bears scars from a previous battle with Aquaman during the recent Crisis  The Dweller  confusing Arthur for Aquaman and calling him his  charge   tells Arthur and King Shark of a prophecy regarding Arthur s future  a prophecy which seems to be a distorted version of the original Aquaman s history  The Dweller reveals that the original Aquaman was  transformed into one akin to a great and terrible enemy of your people and became the vessel of power strange  ancient and terrible   Arthur s first trip causes him to meet many of Aquaman s supporting characters including Mera  the Sea Devils  Vulko  and eventually Ocean Master  During this adventure  the Dweller progressively realizes that he himself is the original Aquaman  despite having no memory of his former life  Later  Arthur finds a humanoid squid named Topo  a naive youth attracted by superheroics and seeking to become a sidekick  and Tempest  now amnesiac  unable to breathe water  and implanted with a post hypnotic suggestion warning of an upcoming battle  The battle soon occurs  and the Dweller Orin is apparently killed  The Justice League is called in to evaluate Orin s situation  but are unable to determine if he is truly dead  or if he can somehow resurrect himself due to his new magical nature  33  In Sword of Atlantis  57  the series  final issue  Aquaman is visited by the Lady of the Lake  who explains his origins  The original Aquaman had given a sample of his water hand to Dr  Curry in order to resurrect Curry s dead son  Arthur  whom he had named after Orin  When Orin attempted to resurrect Sub Diego  a part of his soul attached itself to the dead body of Arthur Joseph Curry  while Orin mutated into the Dweller  Blaming himself for Orin s death  Aquaman vows to never be called  Arthur  again  refraining from using the  stolen  name  asking only to be called Joseph in the future  50  Joseph is considered as a candidate for the new Outsiders by Batman  After seeing him in action with Metamorpho  however  Batman decides against his induction  51  In their quest to rid the Earth of all forms of kryptonite  Superman and Batman journey deep below the sea and find a large amount of it  The two of them are met with hostility by Aquaman and King Shark  A brief fight ensues  but eventually Joseph allows them to take that for which they came  Before doing so  he points out that not everyone may want Superman to find all of Earth s kryptonite  and that he would have to be at least part human to know that  52  Joseph Curry would continue to be the stand in king of Atlantis until after the  Final Crisis  event  It was revealed that Joseph had stepped down from his position due to being unable to deal with the pressure of carrying on Orin s legacy  Tempest later finds Joseph s trident and costume draped over Orin s throne  confirming that he has abandoned his duties  53   edit  Powers and abilities  edit  Orin Aquaman s most widely recognized power is the telepathic ability to communicate with marine life  which he can summon from great distances  Although this power is most often and most easily used on marine life  Aquaman has at times demonstrated the ability to affect any being that lives upon the sea  e g   sea eagles   or even any being evolved from marine life  e g   humans   As per the 2011 DC continuity reboot  Aquaman s telepathy has been greatly downplayed  acknowledging that most marine life doesn t possess enough intelligence to carry a meaningful telepathic communication  Aquaman is now stated to simply add compulsions and needs in the mindset of aquatic life  compelling them to do his bidding by a subtle altering of their midbrain  3  Aquaman has a number of superhuman powers  most of which derive from the fact that he is adapted to live in the depths of the ocean  He has the ability to breathe underwater  He possesses superhuman durability high enough to remain unaffected by the immense pressure and the cold temperature of the ocean depths  this also makes him tough enough to be invulnerable to machine gun fire  54  He also possesses superhuman strength  55  He can swim at very high speeds  capable of reaching speeds of 10 000 feet per second 54  and can swim up Niagara Falls  56  He can see in near total darkness and has enhanced hearing granting limited sonar  2  Although he can remain underwater indefinitely without suffering any ill effects  Aquaman grows weak if he remains on land for extended periods  However  when Batman invented Aquaman s water suit he was able to walk on land for an indefinite amount of time and was no longer vulnerable to a  dehumidifier   2  After the loss of his left hand  Aquaman initially replaced it with a cybernetic retractable hook  then a cybernetic hand  The mechanical hand was replaced by a magical hand made out of water given to him by the Lady of the Lake  which grants Aquaman numerous abilities  including but not limited to  the ability to dehydrate anyone he touches with it  killing them instantly  the ability to change the shape and density of the hand  volume  amp  issue needed  the ability to shoot jets of scalding water  healing abilities  2  the ability to create portals into mystical dimensions  2  the ability to communicate with the Lady of the Lake through the waterbearer hand  57  and the ability to nullify magic  volume  amp  issue needed  Aquaman also has the ability to control water and make it any shape with his own will  However this has been portrayed rarely  Following his death in Aquaman  Sword of Atlantis and resurrection at the end of  Blackest Night   Aquaman has regained his natural hand  but seems to have retained some of his altered powers from the Black Lantern Corps  such as the ability to control undead sea life   edit  Arthur Joseph The new Aquaman has many physical abilities in common with the original Aquaman  including underwater breathing  submarine speed  and superhuman strength  Like the Golden Age Aquaman  Arthur cannot survive outside of water for long  He also gained telepathic powers  He now speaks and understands the languages of the sentient sea peoples unaided  and has a limited ability to communicate with nonsentient sea life  He cannot speak directly to them as his predecessor could  but can send and receive emotional impressions and desires  such as communicating a need for help  The latter ability  and in one instance has been able to  see  through the eyes of nearby fish  58   edit  Justice In the 2005 2007 miniseries Justice  Aquaman has regenerative powers  After having brain surgery experiments performed against his will  Aquaman is left to die  and presumed dead   He later appears having healed completely without scarring   edit  Other versions  edit  Earth Two In the mid 1960s  following the establishment of DC Comics  multiverse  the Golden Age Aquaman became known as the Aquaman of  Earth Two   and the modern day Aquaman became the Aquaman of  Earth One   In modern day comics  the original Aquaman appeared only citation needed  in All Star Squadron  59 60  July   Aug  1986   just before the character was retroactively eliminated from existence via the crossover event  Crisis on Infinite Earths    edit  Just a Lotta Animals Aquaduck  a funny animal version published by DC and member of the Just a Lotta Animals  first appearing in 1983   edit  Supergirl  Wings Ceetka  the Deva of the Water and a reflection of God  He watches over the seas and his kingdom

Florida   edit  Earth 11 In the Countdown tie in The Search for Ray Palmer  Superwoman Batwoman  a female version of Aquaman is shown to reside on Earth 11  This version is called  Anne   is physically similar to Joseph Curry  and commands the armies of Atlantis   edit  JLA Avengers In JLA Avengers  Aquaman is a member of the JLA  He shows his royal attitude many times  especially when he sees the way that Dr  Doom forces his subjects to worship him  He participates in the treasure hunt against the Avengers  but the hunt is all in vain when the villain Krona attacks and mortally wounds both The Grandmaster and Galactus  forcing the Grandmaster to merge the two worlds to stop Krona  When Captain America and Superman  who both sense the changes in the merged universe  attack each other  Aquaman is found by the Avenger Vision  and the two team up to discover what is wrong with the world  Aquaman sees the remains of the Daily Planet and realises this is his world  The two are ambushed by villains and Aquaman is nearly killed  but are rescued by a group of Leaguers and Avengers  He later sees his own hand being devoured when the Grandmaster shows the two teams the true realities  He agrees to battle Krona  and even lends one of his Atlantean ships to the battle  He shows off his immense psychic control over sea life when he single handedly shuts down the minds of Atlantean soldiers under the control of Attuma  although his abilities only partially affect Namor due to Namor s half human physiology  He sticks with the battle to the end and is one of the last JLAers remaining before Krona s stronghold crumbles and the universes separate   edit  Flashpoint In the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint event  Aquaman was brought back to Atlantis when he was a teenager  due to the death of his father  As a result  the young Arthur never learned compassion and kindness from his father  who was killed by the Atlantean agents sent to recover him  59  In the present day  Aquaman and all of Atlantis wage war against Wonder Woman and the Amazons  60  He caused Western Europe to sink into the sea killing over 60 million people  intending to sink England as well and is later seen alongside his brother  the Ocean Master  in the flooded remains of Paris where they attack the pirate Deathstroke and his crew members Sonar  Icicle  and Clayface  61  After taking them out  Aquaman then left the pirate Deathstroke to die  as he had other work to do  However  Deathstroke survives with the help of Sonar  62  The war against the Amazons started when Diana s mother  Hippolyta  was killed on Aquaman and Diana s wedding day  and in an act of retribution  Wonder Woman later killed Mera who had apparently married Aquaman  The wedding was going to happen after Atlantis was discovered by the Amazons when Aquaman saved and healed Diana when she was wounded by a sea creature  Both of the races then revealed themselves to the outside world  63  The death of Hippolyta was however revealed to be a casualty of war as the real target was Wonder Woman  A plot between Orm and Artemis to prevent the union of Aquaman and Wonder Woman was also revealed  64  In the present  Aquaman reassigns Siren and Ocean Master to assassinate Terra in New Themyscira  The mission failed  with Siren being killed by Diana s aunt  Penthesleia  The Amazonian Furies then attack the reinforcements led by Aquaman  who is confronted in battle by their leader  Wonder Woman  59  During their struggle  Wonder Woman tells him that they have both been deceived  She discovers that his brother Ocean Master and Penthesileia are both responsible for the war between the Atlanteans and the Amazons  and that it was a ruse planned by them  65  While the Atlanteans are going to the surface Aquaman believes she has set a trap  She escapes from Aquaman  who refuses her word  Aquaman then arrives on New Themyscira  66  Aquaman and Wonder Woman are approached by the Flash and the heroes  who are here to stop the war  67  Aquaman is attacked by Kal El  68   edit  Collected editions Title Material collected Pages ISBN Aquaman Archives  Vol  1 Adventure Comics  260 280  282
