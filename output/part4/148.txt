Northern Europe  the largest of the three Baltic states  It is situated along the southeastern shore of the Baltic Sea  whereby to the west lie Sweden and Denmark  It borders Latvia to the north  Belarus to the east and south  Poland to the south  and a Russian exclave  Kaliningrad Oblast  to the southwest  Lithuania has an estimated population of 3 2 million as of 2011  and its capital and largest city is Vilnius  The Lithuanians are a Baltic people  and the official language  Lithuanian  is one of only two living languages  together with Latvian  in the Baltic branch of the Indo European language family  For centuries  the southeastern shore of the Baltic Sea was inhabited by various Baltic tribes  In the 1230s the Lithuanian lands were united by Mindaugas  who was crowned as King of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania  the first Lithuanian state  on 6 July 1253  6  During the 14th century  the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was the largest country in Europe  present day Belarus  Ukraine  and parts of Poland and Russia were territories of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania  With the Lublin Union of 1569  Lithuania and Poland formed a voluntary two state union  the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth  The Commonwealth lasted more than two centuries  until neighboring countries systematically dismantled it from 1772 to 1795  with the Russian Empire annexing most of Lithuania s territory  In the aftermath of World War I  Lithuania s Act of Independence was signed on 16 February 1918  declaring the re establishment of a sovereign state  Starting in 1940  Lithuania was occupied first by the Soviet Union and then by Nazi Germany  As World War II neared its end in 1944 and the Germans retreated  the Soviet Union reoccupied Lithuania  On 11 March 1990  the year before the break up of the Soviet Union  Lithuania became the first Soviet republic to declare independence  Prior to the global financial crisis of 2007 2010  Lithuania had one of the fastest growing economies in the European Union  Lithuania is a member of NATO  the Council of Europe  and the European Union  Lithuania is also a full member of the Schengen Agreement  7  The United Nations Human

period in the 10th millennium BC  Over a millennium  the Proto Indo Europeans  who arrived in the 3rd   2nd millennium BC  mixed with the local population and formed various Baltic tribes  The first written mention of Lithuania is found in a medieval German manuscript  the Annals of Quedlinburg  in an entry dated 9 March 1009  8   edit  Medieval Trakai Island Castle Initially inhabited by fragmented Baltic tribes  in the 1230s the Lithuanian lands were united by Mindaugas  who was crowned as King of Lithuania on 6 July 1253  6  After his assassination in 1263  pagan Lithuania was a target of the Christian crusades of the Teutonic Knights and the Livonian Order  Despite the devastating century long struggle with the Orders  the Grand Duchy of Lithuania expanded rapidly  overtaking former Slavic principalities of Kievan Rus   By the end of the 14th century  Lithuania was one of the largest countries in Europe and included present day Belarus  Ukraine  and parts of Poland and Russia  9  The geopolitical situation between the west and the east determined the multicultural and multi confessional character of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania  The ruling elite practiced religious tolerance and borrowed Chancery Slavonic language as an auxiliary language to the Latin for official documents  Battle of Grunwald and Vytautas the Great in the centre In 1385  the Grand Duke Jogaila accepted Poland s offer to become its king  Jogaila embarked on gradual christianization of Lithuania and established a personal union between Poland and Lithuania  It implied that Lithuania  the fiercely independent land  was one of the last pagan areas of Europe to adopt Christianity  After two civil wars  Vytautas the Great became the Grand Duke of Lithuania in 1392  During his reign  Lithuania reached the peak of its territorial expansion  centralization of the state was begun  and the Lithuanian nobility became increasingly prominent in state politics  Thanks to close cooperation  the armies of Lithuania and Poland achieved a great victory over the Teutonic Knights in 1410 at the Battle of Grunwald  one of the largest battles of medieval Europe  10  11  12  After the deaths of Jogaila and Vytautas  the Lithuanian nobility attempted to break the union between Poland and Lithuania  independently selecting Grand Dukes from the Jagiellon dynasty  But  at the end of the 15th century  Lithuania was forced to seek a closer alliance with Poland when the growing power of the Grand Duchy of Moscow threatened Lithuania s Russian principalities and sparked the Muscovite Lithuanian Wars and the Livonian War   edit  Modern The Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth was created in 1569  As a member of the Commonwealth  Lithuania retained its institutions  including a separate army  currency  and statutory laws  13  Eventually Polonization affected all aspects of Lithuanian life  politics  language  culture  and national identity  From the mid 16th to the mid 17th centuries  culture  arts  and education flourished  fueled by the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation  From 1573  the Kings of Poland and Grand Dukes of Lithuania were elected by the nobility  who were granted ever increasing Golden Liberties  These liberties  especially the liberum veto  led to anarchy and the eventual dissolution of the state  During the Northern Wars  1655 1661   the Lithuanian territory and economy were devastated by the Swedish army  Before it could fully recover  Lithuania was ravaged during the Great Northern War  1700 1721   The war  plague  and famine caused the deaths of approximately 40  of the country s population  14  Foreign powers  especially Russia  became dominant in the domestic politics of the Commonwealth  Numerous factions among the nobility used the Golden Liberties to prevent any reforms  Eventually  the Commonwealth was partitioned in 1772  1792  and 1795 by the Russian Empire  Prussia  and Habsburg Austria  The largest area of Lithuanian territory became part of Russian Empire  After unsuccessful uprisings in 1831 and 1863  the Tsarist authorities implemented a number of Russification policies  They banned the Lithuanian press  closed cultural and educational institutions  and made Lithuania part of a new administrative region called Northwestern Krai  These ruthless Russification policies failed owing to extensive network of book smugglers and secret Lithuanian home schooling  After the Russo Turkish War  1877 1878   when German diplomats assigned what were seen as Russian spoils of war to Turkey  the relationship between Russia and the German Empire became complicated  The Russian Empire resumed the construction of fortresses at its western borders for defence against a potential invasion from Germany in the West  On 7 July 1879 the Russian Emperor Alexander II approved of a proposal from the Russian military leadership to build the largest  first class  defensive structure in the entire state   the 65 km2  25 sq mi  Kaunas Fortress  15  Between 1868 and 1914  approximately 635 000 people  almost 20  of the population  emigrated from Lithuania  16  Large numbers of Lithuanians went to the United States in 1867 1868 after a famine  17  A Lithuanian National Revival laid the foundations of the modern Lithuanian nation and independent Lithuania   edit  20th and 21st centuries The original 20 members of the Council of Lithuania after signing the Act of Independence of Lithuania  16 February 1918  Map showing changes in the territory of Lithuania from the 13th century to the present day  During World War I  the Council of Lithuania  Lietuvos Taryba  declared the independence of Lithuania on 16 February 1918  and the re establishment of the Lithuanian State  Lithuania s foreign policy was dominated by territorial disputes with Poland and Germany  The Vilnius Region  and Vilnius  the historical capital of Lithuania   and so designated in the Constitution of Lithuania  were seized by the Polish army during  eligowski s Mutiny in October 1920 and annexed two years later by Poland  For 19 years Kaunas became the Temporary capital of Lithuania  The Polish occupation of Vilnius was greatly resented by Lithuania  there were no diplomatic relations between the two states for most of the period between the two world wars  Acquired during the Klaip da Revolt of 1923  the Klaip da Region was ceded to Germany after a German ultimatum in March 1939  During the interwar period  the domestic affairs of Lithuania were controlled by the authoritarian President  Antanas Smetona and his party  the Lithuanian Nationalist Union  who came to power after the coup d  tat of 1926  The Soviet Union returned Vilnius to Lithuania after the Soviet invasion of Eastern Poland in September 1939  18  In June 1940  the Soviet Union occupied and annexed Lithuania in accordance to the secret protocols of Molotov Ribbentrop Pact  19  20  A year later the Soviet Union was attacked by Nazi Germany  leading to the Nazi occupation of Lithuania  The Nazis and their collaborators murdered around 190 000 Jews of Lithuania 21   91  of the pre war Jewish community  during the Holocaust  After the retreat of the German armed forces  the Soviets re established the annexation of Lithuania in 1944  It followed with massive deportations of citizens to Siberia  22  complete nationalisation and collectivisation and general sovietization of everyday life  From 1944 to 1952 approximately 100 000 Lithuanian partisans fought a guerrilla war against the Soviet system  An estimated 30 000 partisans and their supporters were killed  and many more were arrested and deported to Siberian gulags  It is estimated that Lithuania lost 780 000 people during World War II  23  The advent of perestroika and glasnost in the late 1980s allowed the establishment of S j dis  an anti communist independence movement  After a landslide victory in elections to the Supreme Soviet  members of S j dis proclaimed Lithuania s independence on 11 March 1990  becoming the first Soviet republic to do so  The Soviet Union attempted to suppress the secession by imposing an economic blockade  Soviet troops attacked the Vilnius TV Tower and killed 14 Lithuanian civilians on the night of 13 January 1991  January Events   24  25  On 31 July 1991 Soviet paramilitaries killed seven Lithuanian border guards on the Belarusian border in what became known as the Medininkai Massacre  On 4 February 1991  Iceland became the first country to recognise Lithuanian independence  After the Soviet August Coup  independent Lithuania received wide official recognition and joined the United Nations on 17 September 1991  The last Soviet troops left Lithuania on 31 August 1993   even earlier than they departed from East Germany  Lithuania  seeking closer ties with the West  applied for NATO membership in 1994  After a transition from a planned economy to a free market one  Lithuania became a full member of NATO and the European Union in the spring of 2004 and a member of the Schengen Agreement on 21 December 2007   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of Lithuania Lithuania is
