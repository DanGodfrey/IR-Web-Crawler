America Words having different meanings in British and American English A L   M Z Works Works with different titles in the UK and US v t e American English is a set of dialects of the English language used mostly in the United States  Approximately two thirds of the world s native speakers of English live in the United States  1  English is the most common language in the United States  Though the U S  federal government has no official language  English is the common language used by the federal government and is considered the de facto language of the United States because of its widespread use  English has been given official status by 28 of the 50 state governments  2  3  The use of English in the United States was a result of English colonization  The first wave of English speaking settlers arrived in North America during the 17th century  followed by further migrations in the 18th and 19th centuries  Since then  American English has been influenced by the languages of West Africa  the Native American population  and immigration  Contents 1 Phonology 2 Vocabulary 2 1 Creation of an American lexicon 2 2 Morphology 2 3 English words that survived in the United States and

challenged and removed   June 2009  Compared to English as spoken in England  North American English 4  is more homogeneous  Some distinctive accents can be found on the East Coast  for example  in eastern New England and New York City  partly because these areas were in close contact with England and imitated prestigious varieties of British English at a time when these were undergoing changes  5  Need quotation to verify  In addition  many speech communities on the East Coast have existed in their present locations for centuries  while the interior of the country was settled by people from all regions of the existing United States and developed a far more generic linguistic pattern  citation needed  The red areas are those where non rhotic pronunciations are found among some white people in the United States  AAVE influenced non rhotic pronunciations may be found among black people throughout the country  6  Most North American speech is rhotic  as English was in most places in the 17th century  Rhoticity was further supported by Hiberno English  West Country English and Scottish English as well as the fact most regions of England at this time also had rhotic accents  7  In most varieties of North American English  the sound corresponding to the letter r is an alveolar approximant     or retroflex     rather than a trill or a tap  The loss of syllable final r in North America is confined mostly to the accents of eastern New England  New York City and surrounding areas and the coastal portions of the South  and African American Vernacular English  In rural tidewater Virginia and eastern New England   r  is non rhotic in accented  such as  bird    work    first    birthday   as well as unaccented syllables  although this is declining among the younger generation of speakers  citation needed  Dropping of syllable final r sometimes happens in natively rhotic dialects if r is located in unaccented syllables or words and the next syllable or word begins in a consonant  In England  the lost r was often changed into      schwa   giving rise to a new class of falling diphthongs  citation needed  Furthermore  the er sound of fur or butter  is realized in AmE as a monophthongal r colored vowel  stressed     or unstressed     as represented in the IPA   citation needed  This does not happen in the non rhotic varieties of North American speech  citation needed  Some other English changes in which most North American dialects do not participate  The shift of     to      the so called  broad A   before  f    s              z    v  alone or preceded by a homorganic nasal  This is the difference between the British Received Pronunciation and American pronunciation of bath and dance  citation needed  In the United States  only eastern New England speakers took up this modification  although even there it is becoming increasingly rare  citation needed  The realization of intervocalic  t  as a glottal stop      as in  b   l  for bottle   This change is not universal for British English and is not considered a feature of Received Pronunciation  citation needed  This is not a property of most North American dialects  Newfoundland English in Canada is a notable exception  citation needed  On the other hand  North American English has undergone some sound changes not found in other varieties of English speech  The merger of     and      making father and bother rhyme  This change is nearly universal in North American English  Exceptions are accents in northeastern New England  such as the Boston accent  and in New York City   8  9  10  The merger of     and      citation needed  This is the so called cot caught merger  where cot and caught are homophones  This change has occurred in eastern New England  in Pittsburgh and surrounding areas  and from the Great Plains westward  citation needed  For speakers who do not merge caught and cot  The replacement of the cot vowel with the caught vowel before voiceless fricatives  as in cloth  off  which is found in some old fashioned varieties of RP    as well as before      as in strong  long   usually in gone  often in on  and irregularly before      log  hog  dog  fog  which is not found in British English at all    The replacement of the lot vowel with the strut vowel in most utterances of the words was  of  from  what and in many utterances of the words everybody  nobody  somebody  anybody  the word because has either     or      11 want has normally     or      sometimes      12  Vowel merger before intervocalic      Which vowels are affected varies between dialects  but the Mary marry merry  nearer mirror  and hurry furry mergers are all widespread  Another such change is the laxing of  e    i  and  u  to          and     before      causing pronunciations like  p      p    and  pj    for pair  peer and pure  The resulting sound      is often further reduced to      especially after palatals  so that cure  pure  mature and sure rhyme with fir  Dropping of  j  is more extensive than in RP  In most North American accents   j  is dropped after all alveolar and interdental consonant  so that new  duke  Tuesday  resume are pronounced  nu    duk    tuzde       zum     tensing in environments that vary widely from accent to accent  for example  for many speakers      is approximately realized as  e   before nasal stops  In some accents  particularly those from Baltimore  Philadelphia  and New York City      and  e   contrast sometimes  as in Yes  I can  k n  vs  tin can  ke n   The flapping of intervocalic  t  and  d  to alveolar tap     before unstressed vowels  as in butter  party  and syllabic  l   bottle   as well as at the end of a word or morpheme before any vowel  what else  whatever   Thus  for most speakers  pairs such as ladder latter  metal medal  and coating coding are pronounced the same  For many speakers  this merger is incomplete and does not occur after  a    these speakers tend to pronounce writer with      and rider with  a    This is a form of Canadian raising but  unlike more extreme forms of that process  does not affect  a    In some areas and idiolects  a phonemic distinction between what elsewhere become homophones through this process is maintained by vowel lengthening in the vowel preceding the formerly voiced consonant  e g     l       for  ladder  as opposed to   l      for  latter   T glottalization is common when  t  is in the final position of a syllable or word  get  fretful           f   f l    though this is always superseded by the aforementioned rules of flapping Both intervocalic  nt  and  n  may be realized as  n  or       making winter and winner homophones  Most areas in which  nt  is reduced to  n   it is accompanied further by nasalization of simple post vocalic  n   so that  Vnt  and  Vn  remain phonemically distinct  In such cases  the preceding vowel becomes nasalized  and is followed in cases where the former  nt  was present  by a distinct  n   This stop absorption by the preceding nasal  n  does not occur when the second syllable is stressed  as in entail  The pin pen merger  by which     is raised to     before nasal stops  making pairs like pen pin homophonous  This merger originated in Southern American English but is now also sometimes found in parts of the Midwest and West as well  especially in people with roots in the mountainous areas of the Southeastern United States  Some mergers found in most varieties of both American and British English include  citation needed  The merger of the vowels     and  o  before  r   making pairs like horse hoarse  corps core  for four  morning mourning  etc  homophones  The wine whine merger making pairs like wine whine  wet whet  Wales whales  wear where  etc  homophones  in most cases eliminating      the voiceless labiovelar fricative  Many older varieties of southern and western American English still keep these distinct  but the merger appears to be spreading   edit  Vocabulary North America has given the English lexicon many thousands of words  meanings  and phrases  Several thousand are now used in English as spoken internationally   edit  Creation of an American lexicon This subsection needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   June 2009  The process of coining new lexical items started as soon as the colonists began borrowing names for unfamiliar flora  fauna  and topography from the Native American languages  13  Examples of such names are opossum  raccoon  squash and moose  from Algonquian   14  Other Native American loanwords  such as wigwam or moccasin  describe articles in common use among Native Americans  The languages of the other colonizing nations also added to the American vocabulary  for instance  cookie  cruller  stoop  and pit  of a fruit  from Dutch  levee  portage   carrying of boats or goods   and  probably  gopher from French  barbecue  stevedore  and rodeo from Spanish  15  16  17  18  Among the earliest and most notable regular  English  additions to the American vocabulary  dating from the early days of colonization through the early 19th century  are terms describing the features of the North American landscape  for instance  run  branch  fork  snag  bluff  gulch  neck  of the woods   barrens  bottomland  notch  knob  riffle  rapids  watergap  cutoff  trail  timberline and divide citation needed   Already existing words such as creek  slough  sleet and  in later use  watershed received new meanings that were unknown in England  citation needed  Other noteworthy American toponyms are found among loanwords  for example  prairie  butte  French   bayou  Choctaw via Louisiana French   coulee  Canadian French  but used also in Louisiana with a different meaning   canyon  mesa  arroyo  Spanish   vlei  skate  kill  Dutch  Hudson Valley   The word corn  used in England to refer to wheat  or any cereal   came to denote the plant Zea mays  the most important crop in the U S   originally named Indian corn by the earliest settlers  wheat  rye  barley  oats  etc  came to be collectively referred to as grain  or breadstuffs   Other notable farm related vocabulary additions were the new meanings assumed by barn  not only a building for hay and grain storage  but also for housing livestock  and team  not just the horses  but also the vehicle along with them   as well as  in various periods  the terms range   corn  crib  truck  elevator  sharecropping and feedlot  citation needed  Ranch  later applied to a house style  derives from Mexican Spanish  most Spanish contributions came after the War of 1812  with the opening of the West  Among these are  other than toponyms  chaps  from chaparreras   plaza  lasso  bronco  buckaroo  rodeo  examples of  English  additions from the cowboy era are bad man  maverick  chuck   food   and Boot Hill  from the California Gold Rush came such idioms as hit pay dirt or strike it rich  The word blizzard probably originated in the West  A couple of notable late 18th century additions are the verb belittle and the noun bid  both first used in writing by Thomas Jefferson  citation needed  With the new continent developed new forms of dwelling  and hence a large inventory of words designating real estate concepts  land office  lot  outlands  waterfront  the verbs locate and relocate  betterment  addition  subdivision   types of property  log cabin  adobe  in the 18th century  frame house  apartment  tenement house  shack  shanty in the 19th century  project  condominium  townhouse  split level  mobile home  multi family in the 20th century   and parts thereof  driveway  breezeway  backyard  dooryard  clapboard  siding  trim  baseboard  stoop  from Dutch   family room  den  and  in recent years  HVAC  central air  walkout basement   citation needed  Ever since the American Revolution  a great number of terms connected with the U S  political institutions have entered the language  examples are run  gubernatorial  primary election  carpetbagger  after the Civil War   repeater  lame duck  a British term used originally in Banking  19  and pork barrel  Some of these are internationally used  for example  caucus  gerrymander  filibuster  exit poll   citation needed  The rise of capitalism  the development of industry and material innovations throughout the 19th and 20th centuries were the source of a massive stock of distinctive new words  phrases and idioms  Typical examples are the vocabulary of railroading  see further at rail terminology  and transportation terminology  ranging from names of roads  from dirt roads and back roads to freeways and parkways  to road infrastructure  parking lot  overpass  rest area   and from automotive terminology to public transit  for example  in the sentence  riding the subway downtown    such American introductions as commuter  from commutation ticket   concourse  to board  a vehicle   to park  double park and parallel park  a car   double decker or the noun terminal have long been used in all dialects of English  20  Trades of various kinds have endowed  American  English with household words describing jobs and occupations  bartender  longshoreman  patrolman  hobo  bouncer  bellhop  roustabout  white collar  blue collar  employee  boss  from Dutch   intern  busboy  mortician  senior citizen   businesses and workplaces  department store  supermarket  thrift store  gift shop  drugstore  motel  main street  gas station  hardware store  savings and loan  hock  also from Dutch    as well as general concepts and innovations  automated teller machine  smart card  cash register  dishwasher  reservation  as at hotels   pay envelope  movie  mileage  shortage  outage  blood bank   citation needed  Already existing English words such as store  shop  dry goods  haberdashery  lumber underwent shifts in meaning  some such as mason  student  clerk  the verbs can  as in  canned goods    ship  fix  carry  enroll  as in school   run  as in  run a business    release and haul were given new significations  while others  such as tradesman  have retained meanings that disappeared in England  From the world of business and finance came breakeven  merger  delisting  downsize  disintermediation  bottom line  from sports terminology came  jargon aside  Monday morning quarterback  cheap shot  game plan  football   in the ballpark  out of left field  off base  hit and run  and many other idioms from baseball  gamblers coined bluff  blue chip  ante  bottom dollar  raw deal  pass the buck  ace in the hole  freeze out  showdown  miners coined bedrock  bonanza  peter out  pan out and the verb prospect from the noun  and railroadmen are to be credited with make the grade  sidetrack  head on  and the verb railroad  A number of Americanisms describing material innovations remained largely confined to North America  elevator  ground  gasoline  many automotive terms fall in this category  although many do not  hatchback  SUV  station wagon  tailgate  motorhome  truck  pickup truck  to exhaust   citation needed  In addition to the above mentioned loans from French  Spanish  Mexican Spanish  Dutch  and Native American languages  other accretions from foreign languages came with 19th and early 20th century immigration  notably  from Yiddish  chutzpah  schmooze  tush  and German hamburger and culinary terms like frankfurter franks  liverwurst  sauerkraut  wiener  deli catessen   scram  kindergarten  gesundheit  21  musical terminology  whole note  half note  etc    and apparently cookbook  fresh   impudent   and what gives  Such constructions as Are you coming with  and I like to dance  for  I like dancing   may also be the result of German or Yiddish influence  22  Finally  a large number of English colloquialisms from various periods are American in origin  some have lost their American flavor  from OK and cool to nerd and 24 7   while others have not  have a nice day  sure   23  many are now distinctly old fashioned  swell  groovy   Some English words now in general use  such as hijacking  disc jockey  boost  bulldoze and jazz  originated as American slang  Among the many English idioms of U S  origin are get the hang of  take for a ride  bark up the wrong tree  keep tabs  run scared  take a backseat  have an edge over  stake a claim  take a shine to  in on the ground floor  bite off more than one can chew  off on the wagon  stay put  inside track  stiff upper lip  bad hair day  throw a monkey wrench  under the weather  jump bail  come clean  come again   it ain t over till it s over  what goes around comes around  and will the real x please stand up  24   edit  Morphology American English has always shown a marked tendency to use nouns as verbs  25  Examples of verbed nouns are interview  advocate  vacuum  lobby  pressure  rear end  transition  feature  profile  spearhead  skyrocket  showcase  service  as a car   corner  torch  exit  as in  exit the lobby    factor  in mathematics   gun   shoot    author  which disappeared in English around 1630 and was revived in the U S  three centuries later  and  out of American material  proposition  graft  bribery   bad mouth  vacation  major  backpack  backtrack  intern  ticket  traffic violations   hassle  blacktop  peer review  dope and OD  and  of course verbed as used at the start of this sentence  Compounds coined in the U S  are for instance foothill  flatlands  badlands  landslide  in all senses   overview  the noun   backdrop  teenager  brainstorm  bandwagon  hitchhike  smalltime  deadbeat  frontman  lowbrow and highbrow  hell bent  foolproof  nitpick  about face  later verbed   upfront  in all senses   fixer upper  no show  many of these are phrases used as adverbs or  often  hyphenated attributive adjectives  non profit  for profit  free for all  ready to wear  catchall  low down  down and out  down and dirty  in your face  nip and tuck  many compound nouns and adjectives are open  happy hour  fall guy  capital gain  road trip  wheat pit  head start  plea bargain  some of these are colorful  empty nester  loan shark  ambulance chaser  buzz saw  ghetto blaster  dust bunny   others are euphemistic  differently abled  physically challenged   human resources  affirmative action  correctional facility   Many compound nouns have the form verb plus preposition  add on  stopover  lineup  shakedown  tryout  spin off  rundown   summary    shootout  holdup  hideout  comeback  cookout  kickback  makeover  takeover  rollback   decrease    rip off  come on  shoo in  fix up  tie in  tie up   stoppage    stand in  These essentially are nouned phrasal verbs  some prepositional and phrasal verbs are in fact of American origin  spell out  figure out  hold up  brace up  size up  rope in  back up off down out  step down  miss out on  kick around  cash in  rain out  check in and check out  in all senses   fill in   inform    kick in   contribute    square off  sock in  sock away  factor in out  come down with  give up on  lay off  from employment   run into and across   meet    stop by  pass up  put up  money   set up   frame    trade in  pick up on  pick up after  lose out  26  27  Noun endings such as  ee  retiree    ery  bakery    ster  gangster  and  cian  beautician  are also particularly productive  25  Some verbs ending in  ize are of U S  origin  for example  fetishize  prioritize  burglarize  accessorize  itemize  editorialize  customize  notarize  weatherize  winterize  Mirandize  and so are some back formations  locate  fine tune  evolute  curate  donate  emote  upholster  peeve and enthuse   Among syntactical constructions that arose in the U S  are as of  with dates and times   outside of  headed for  meet up with  back of  convince someone to     not to be about to and lack for  Americanisms formed by alteration of existing words include notably pesky  phony  rambunctious  pry  as in  pry open   from prize   putter  verb   buddy  sundae  skeeter  sashay and kitty corner  Adjectives that arose in the U S  are for example  lengthy  bossy  cute and cutesy  grounded  of a child   punk  in all senses   sticky  of the weather   through  as in  through train   or meaning  finished    and many colloquial forms such as peppy or wacky  American blends include motel  guesstimate  infomercial and televangelist   edit  English words that survived in the United States and not Britain A number of words and meanings that originated in Middle English or Early Modern English and that always have been in everyday use in the United States dropped out in most varieties of British English  some of these have cognates in Lowland Scots  Terms such as fall   autumn    faucet  diaper  candy  skillet  eyeglasses  and obligate  are often regarded as Americanisms  Fall for example came to denote the season in 16th century England  a contraction of Middle English expressions like  fall of the leaf  and  fall of the year   28  During the 17th century  English immigration to the British colonies in North America was at its peak and the new settlers took the English language with them  While the term fall gradually became obsolete in Britain  it became the more common term in North America  Gotten  past participle of get  is often considered to be an Americanism  although there are some areas of Britain  such as Lancashire and North eastern England  that still continue to use it and sometimes also use putten as the past participle for put  which is not done by most speakers of American English   29  Other words and meanings  to various extents  were brought back to Britain  especially in the second half of the 20th century  these include hire   to employ    quit   to stop   which spawned quitter in the U S    I guess  famously criticized by H  W  Fowler   baggage  hit  a place   and the adverbs overly and presently   currently    Some of these  for example monkey wrench and wastebasket  originated in 19th century Britain  The mandative subjunctive  as in  the City Attorney suggested that the case not be closed   is livelier in American English than it is in British English  It appears in some areas as a spoken usage and is considered obligatory in contexts that are more formal  The adjectives mad meaning  angry   smart meaning  intelligent   and sick meaning  ill  are also more frequent in American  these meanings are also frequent in Hiberno English  than British English  30   edit  Regional differences Main articles  Regional vocabularies of American English and North American English regional phonology While written AmE is standardized across the country  there are several recognizable variations in the spoken language  both in pronunciation and in vernacular vocabulary  General American is the name given to any American accent that is relatively free of noticeable regional influences  After the Civil War  the settlement of the western territories by migrants from the Eastern U S  led to dialect mixing and leveling  so that regional dialects are most strongly differentiated along the Eastern seaboard  The Connecticut River and Long Island Sound is usually regarded as the southern western extent of New England speech  which has its roots in the speech of the Puritans from East Anglia who settled in the Massachusetts Bay Colony  The Potomac River generally divides a group of Northern coastal dialects from the beginning of the Coastal Southern dialect area  in between these two rivers several local variations exist  chief among them the one that prevails in and around New York City and northern New Jersey  which developed on a Dutch substratum after the English conquered New Amsterdam  The main features of Coastal Southern speech can be traced to the speech of the English from the West Country who settled in Virginia after leaving England at the time of the English Civil War  Although no longer region specific  31 African American Vernacular English  which remains prevalent among African Americans  has a close relationship to Southern varieties of AmE and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many Americans  A distinctive speech pattern also appears near the border between Canada and the United States  centered on the Great Lakes region  but only on the American side   This is the Inland North Dialect the  standard Midwestern  speech that was the basis for General American in the mid 20th century  although it has been recently modified by the northern cities vowel shift   Those not from this area frequently confuse it with the North Midland dialect treated below  referring to both collectively as  Midwestern  in the mid Atlantic region or  Northern  in the Southern US  The so called   Minnesotan  dialect is also prevalent in the cultural Upper Midwest  and is characterized by influences from the German and Scandinavian settlers of the region  yah for yes ja in German  pronounced the same way   In the interior  the situation is very different  West of the Appalachian Mountains begins the broad zone of what is generally called  Midland  speech  This is divided into two discrete subdivisions  the North Midland that begins north of the Ohio River valley area  and the South Midland speech  sometimes the former is designated simply  Midland  and the latter is reckoned as  Highland Southern   The North Midland speech continues to expand westward until it becomes the closely related Western dialect which contains Pacific Northwest English as well as the well known California English  although in the immediate San Francisco area some older speakers do not possess the cot caught merger and thus retain the distinction between words such as cot and caught which reflects a historical Mid Atlantic heritage  The South Midland or Highland Southern dialect follows the Ohio River in a generally southwesterly direction  moves across Arkansas and Oklahoma west of the Mississippi  and peters out in West Texas  It is a version of the Midland speech that has assimilated some coastal Southern forms  outsiders often mistakenly believe South Midland speech and coastal South speech to be the same   The island state of Hawaii has a distinctive Hawaiian Pidgin  Finally  dialect development in the United States has been notably influenced by the distinctive speech of such important cultural centers as Baltimore  Boston  Charleston  Chicago  Detroit  New Orleans  New York City  Philadelphia and Pittsburgh  which imposed their marks on the surrounding areas   edit  Differences between British and American English Main article  American and British English differences American English and British English  BrE  differ at the levels of phonology  phonetics  vocabulary  and  to a lesser extent  grammar and orthography  The first large American dictionary  An American Dictionary of the English Language  was written by Noah Webster in 1828  Webster intended to show that the United States  which was a relatively new country at the time  spoke a different dialect from that of Britain  Differences in grammar are relatively minor  and normally do not affect mutual intelligibility  these include  different use of some verbal auxiliaries  formal  rather than notional  agreement with collective nouns  different preferences for the past forms of a few verbs  for example  AmE BrE  learned learnt  burned burnt  snuck sneaked  dove dived   different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts  for example  AmE in school  BrE at school   and whether or not a definite article is used  in very few cases  AmE to the hospital  BrE to hospital  contrast  however  AmE actress Elizabeth Taylor  BrE the actress Elizabeth Taylor   Often  these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules  and most are not stable  since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other  32  Differences in orthography are also trivial  Some of the forms that now serve to distinguish American from British spelling  color for colour  center for centre  traveler for traveller  etc   were introduced by Noah Webster himself  others are due to spelling tendencies in Britain from the 17th century until the present day  for example   ise for  ize  although the Oxford English Dictionary still prefers the  ize ending  and cases favored by the francophile tastes of 19th century Victorian England  which had little effect on AmE  for example  programme for program  manoeuvre for maneuver  skilful for skillful  cheque for check  etc    33  AmE sometimes favors words that are morphologically more complex  whereas BrE uses clipped forms  such as AmE transportation and BrE transport or where the British form is a back formation  such as AmE burglarize and BrE burgle  from burglar   It should  however  be noted that while individuals usually use one or the other  both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems   edit  See also United States portal Language portal Dictionary of American
