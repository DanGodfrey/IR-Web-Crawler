federal government of the constitutional republic of fifty states and one district that is the United States of America  The federal government comprises three distinct branches of government  a legislative  an executive and a judiciary  These branches and their various powers are delineated in the U S  Constitution  the powers are specified in greater detail in laws enacted by Congress  The seat of government of the United States is in Washington  D C   a geographical area that is not located within any state  This has led to  Washington  commonly being used as a metonym for the U S  federal government  Contents 1 History 2 Legislative branch 2 1 Powers of Congress 2 2 Makeup of Congress 2 2 1 House of Representatives 2 2 2 Senate 2 2 3 Different powers 2 2 4 Impeachment of

the government of the United States is laid out in the Constitution  The government was formed in 1789  making the United States one of the world s first  if not the first  modern national constitutional republic  1  The United States government is based on the principle of federalism  in which power is shared between the federal government and state governments  The details of American federalism  including what powers the federal government should have and how those powers can be exercised  have been debated ever since the adoption of the Constitution  Some make the case for expansive federal powers while others argue for a more limited role for the central government in relation to individuals  the states or other recognized entities  Since the U S  Civil War  the powers of the federal government have generally expanded greatly  although there have been periods since that time of legislative branch dominance  e g   the decades immediately following the Civil War  or when states  rights proponents have succeeded in limiting federal power through legislative action  executive prerogative or by constitutional interpretation by the courts  2  3  One of the theoretical pillars of the United States Constitution is the idea of  checks and balances  among the powers and responsibilities of the three branches of American government  the executive  the legislative and the judiciary  For example  while the Congress  legislative  has the power to create law  the executive  President  can veto any legislation    an act which  in turn  can be overridden by Congress  The President nominates judges to the nation s highest judiciary authority  The Supreme Court   but those nominees must be approved by Congress  The Supreme Court  in its turn  has the power to invalidate as  unconstitutional  any law passed by the Congress  These and other examples are examined in more detail in the text below  Legislative branch Main article  United States Congress The United States Congress is the legislative branch of the federal government  It is bicameral  comprising the House of Representatives and the Senate  Powers of Congress The Constitution grants numerous powers to Congress  Enumerated in Article I  Section 8  these include the powers to levy and collect taxes  to coin money and regulate its value  provide for punishment for counterfeiting  establish post offices and roads  promote progress of science by issuing patents  create federal courts inferior to the Supreme Court  combat piracies and felonies  declare war  raise and support armies  provide and maintain a navy  make rules for the regulation of land and naval forces  provide for  arm and discipline the militia  exercise exclusive legislation in the District of Columbia  and to make laws necessary to properly execute powers  Over the two centuries since the United States was formed  many disputes have arisen over the limits on the powers of the federal government  These disputes have often been the subject of lawsuits that have ultimately been decided by the United States Supreme Court  Makeup of Congress House of Representatives The House currently consists of 435 voting members  each of whom represents a congressional district  The number of representatives each state has in the House is based on each state s population as determined in the most recent United States Census  All 435 representatives serve a two year term  Each state receives a minimum of one representative in the House  In order to be elected as a representative  an individual must be at least 25 years of age  and must have been a U S  citizen for at least seven years  There is no limit on the number of terms a representative may serve  In addition to the 435 voting members  there are six non voting members  consisting of five delegates and one resident commissioner  There is one delegate each from the District of Columbia  Guam  Virgin Islands  American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands  and the resident commissioner from Puerto Rico  4  Senate In contrast the Senate is made up of two senators from each state  regardless of population  There is currently a total of 100 senators  two from each of the 50 states   who each serve six year terms  Approximately one third of the Senate stands for election every two years  Different powers The House and Senate each have particular exclusive powers  For example  the Senate must approve  give  advice and consent  to  many important Presidential appointments  including cabinet officers  federal judges  including nominees to the Supreme Court   department secretaries  heads of federal executive branch departments   U S  military and naval officers  and ambassadors to foreign countries  All legislative bills for the purpose of raising revenue must originate in the House of Representatives  The approval of both chambers is required to pass any legislation  which then may only become law by being signed by the President  or  if the President vetoes the bill  both houses of Congress then re pass the bill  but by a two thirds majority of each chamber  in which case the bill becomes law without the President s signature   The powers of Congress are limited to those enumerated in the Constitution  all other powers are reserved to the states and the people  The Constitution also includes the  Necessary and Proper Clause   which grants Congress the power to  make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers   Members of the House and Senate are elected by first past the post voting in every state except Louisiana  California  and Washington  which have runoffs  Impeachment of federal officers Congress has the power to remove the President  federal judges  and other federal officers from office  The House of Representatives and Senate have separate roles in this process  The House must first vote to  impeach  the official  Then  a trial is held in the Senate to decide whether the official should be removed from office  Although two presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives  Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton   neither of them was removed following trial in the Senate  Congressional procedures Article I  Section 2  paragraph 2 of the U S  Constitution gives each chamber the power to  determine the rules of its proceedings   From this provision were created congressional committees  which do the work of drafting legislation and conducting congressional investigations into national matters  The 108th Congress  2003 2005  had 19 standing committees in the House and 17 in the Senate  plus four joint permanent committees with members from both houses overseeing the Library of Congress  printing  taxation and the economy  In addition  each house may name special  or select  committees to study specific problems  Today  much of the congressional workload is borne by subcommittees  of which there are some 150  Powers of Congress Main article  Article One of the United States Constitution The United States Capitol is the seat of government for Congress  Congressional oversight Main article  Congressional oversight Congressional oversight is intended to prevent waste and fraud  protect civil liberties and individual rights  ensure executive compliance with the law  gather information for making laws and educating the public  and evaluate executive performance  5  It applies to cabinet departments  executive agencies  regulatory commissions and the presidency  Congress s oversight function takes many forms  Committee inquiries and hearings Formal consultations with and reports from the President Senate advice and consent for presidential nominations and for treaties House impeachment proceedings and subsequent Senate trials House and Senate proceedings under the 25th Amendment in the event that the President becomes disabled or the office of the Vice President falls vacant  Informal meetings between legislators and executive officials Congressional membership  each state is allocated a number of seats based on its representation  or ostensible representation  in the case of D C   in the House of Representatives  Each state is allocated two Senators regardless of its population  As of January 2010  the District of Columbia elects a non voting representative to the House of Representatives along with American Samoa  the U S  Virgin Islands  Guam  Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands  Executive branch See also  Article Two of the United States Constitution The executive power in the federal government is vested in the President of the United States  6  although power is often delegated to the Cabinet members and other officials  7  8  The President and Vice President are elected as running mates by the Electoral College  for which each state  as well as the District of Columbia  is allocated a number of seats based on its representation  or ostensible representation  in the case of D C   in both houses of Congress  6  9  The President is limited to a maximum of two non consecutive 10  four year terms  as well as being able to have served for 2 years after succeeding to the presidency  prior to his last term  6  President Main article  President of the United States The executive branch consists of the President and those to whom the President s powers are delegated  The President is both the head of state and government  as well as the military commander in chief and chief diplomat  The President  according to the Constitution  must  take care that the laws be faithfully executed   and  preserve  protect and defend the Constitution   The President presides over the executive branch of the federal government  an organization numbering about 5 million people  including 1 million active duty military personnel and 600000 postal service employees  The forty fourth and current president is Barack Obama  The President may sign legislation passed by Congress into law or may veto it  preventing it from becoming law unless two thirds of both houses of Congress vote to override the veto  The President may unilaterally sign treaties with foreign nations  However  ratification of international treaties requires a two thirds majority vote in the Senate  The President may be impeached by a majority in the House and removed from office by a two thirds majority in the Senate for  treason  bribery  or other high crimes and misdemeanors   The President may not dissolve Congress or call special elections but does have the power to pardon  or release  criminals convicted of offenses against the federal government  except in cases of impeachment   enact executive orders  and  with the consent of the Senate  appoint Supreme Court justices and federal judges  Vice President Main article  Vice President of the United States The Vice President is the second highest executive official in rank of the government  As first in the U S  presidential line of succession  the Vice President becomes President upon the death  resignation  or removal of the President  which has happened nine times in U S  history  Under the Constitution  the Vice President is President of the Senate  By virtue of this role  he or she is the head of the Senate  In that capacity  the Vice President is allowed to vote in the Senate  but only when necessary to break a tie vote  Pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment  the Vice President presides over the joint session of Congress when it convenes to count the vote of the Electoral College  While the Vice President s only constitutionally prescribed functions  aside from presidential succession  relate to his or her role as President of the Senate  the office is now commonly viewed as a member of the executive branch of the federal government  The U S  Constitution does not expressly assign the office to any one branch  causing scholars to dispute whether it belongs to the executive branch  the legislative branch  or both  11  12  Cabinet  executive departments and agencies Main articles  United States Cabinet and List of United States federal agencies Secretary of State Main article  United States Secretary of State The Secretary of State is the Chief Executive Officer of the United States Department of State  the most senior of all federal executive departments  The Secretary of State is the third highest official of the executive branch of the federal government of the United States  after the President and Vice President  The Secretary is a member of the President s Cabinet and the highest ranking cabinet secretary both in the presidential line of succession and order of precedence  The Secretary has many duties and responsibilities  The Secretary serves as the President s chief adviser on U S  foreign policy and as such negotiates  interprets  and terminates treaties and agreements  personally participates in or directs U S  representatives to international conferences  organizations  and agencies  conducts negotiations relating to U S  foreign affairs  and is responsible for the administration and management of foreign embassies and consulate offices  Foreign trade missions and intelligence assets report directly to the Secretary of State  The Secretary is also responsible for overall direction  coordination  and supervision of interdepartmental activities of the U S  government overseas  Other cabinet officials  commissions and agencies The day to day enforcement and administration of federal laws is in the hands of the various federal executive departments  created by Congress to deal with specific areas of national and international affairs  The heads of the 15 departments  chosen by the President and approved with the  advice and consent  of the U S  Senate  form a council of advisers generally known as the President s  Cabinet   In addition to departments  there are a number of staff organizations grouped into the Executive Office of the President  These include the White House staff  the National Security Council  the Office of Management and Budget  the Council of Economic Advisers  the Council on Environmental Quality  the Office of the U S  Trade Representative  the Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Office of Science and Technology Policy  The employees in these United States government agencies are called federal civil servants  There are also independent agencies such as the United States Postal Service  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  NASA   the Central Intelligence Agency  CIA   the Environmental Protection Agency  and the United States Agency for International Development  In addition  there are government owned corporations such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Railroad Passenger Corporation  Judicial branch Main article  United States federal courts See also  Article Three of the United States Constitution The Judiciary explains and applies the laws  This branch does this by hearing and eventually making decisions on various legal cases  Overview of the federal judiciary Article III section I of the Constitution establishes The Supreme Court of the United States and authorizes the United States Congress to establish inferior courts as their need shall arise  Section I also establishes a life time tenure for all federal judges and states that their compensation may not be diminished during their time in office  Article II section II establishes that all federal judges are to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the United States Senate  The Judiciary Act of 1789 subdivided the nation jurisdictionally into judicial districts and created federal courts for each district  The three tiered structure of this act established the basic structure of the national judiciary  the Supreme Court  13 courts of appeals  94 district courts  and two courts of special jurisdiction  Congress  retains the power to re organize or even abolish federal courts lower than the Supreme Court  The U S  Supreme Court adjudicates  cases and controversies  matters pertaining to the federal government  disputes between states  and interpretation of the United States Constitution  and  in general  can declare legislation or executive action made at any level of the government as unconstitutional  nullifying the law and creating precedent for future law and decisions  The United States Constitution does not grant the judicial branch the power of judicial review  the power to declare a law Unconstitutional  The power of judicial review was asserted by Chief Justice Marshall in the landmark Supreme Court Case Marbury v  Madison  1803   There have been instances in the past where such declarations have been ignored by the other two branches  Below the U S  Supreme Court are the United States Courts of Appeals  and below them in turn are the United States District Courts  which are the general trial courts for federal law  and for certain controversies between litigants who are not deemed citizens of the same state   diversity jurisdiction    There are three levels of federal courts with general jurisdiction  meaning that these courts handle criminal cases and civil lawsuits between individuals  The other courts  such as the bankruptcy courts and the Tax Court  are specialized courts handling only certain kinds of cases   subject matter jurisdiction    The Bankruptcy Courts are  under  the district courts  and as such are not considered part of the  Article III  judiciary and also as such their judges do not have lifetime tenure  nor are they Constitutionally exempt from diminution of their remuneration  Also the Tax Court is not an Article III court  but is  instead an  Article I Court    The district courts are the trial courts wherein cases that are considered under the Judicial Code  Title 28  United States Code  consistent with the jurisdictional precepts of  federal question jurisdiction  and  diversity jurisdiction  and  pendent jurisdiction  can be filed and decided  The district courts can also hear cases under  removal jurisdiction   wherein a case brought in State court meets the requirements for diversity jurisdiction  and one party litigant chooses to  remove  the case from state court to federal court  The United States Courts of Appeals are appellate courts that hear appeals of cases decided by the district courts  and some direct appeals from administrative agencies  and some interlocutory appeals  The U S  Supreme Court hears appeals from the decisions of the courts of appeals or state supreme courts  and in addition has original jurisdiction over a small number of cases  The judicial power extends to cases arising under the Constitution  an Act of Congress  a U S  treaty  cases affecting ambassadors  ministers and consuls of foreign countries in the U S   cases and controversies to which the federal government is a party  controversies between states  or their citizens  and foreign nations  or their citizens or subjects   and bankruptcy cases  collectively  federal question jurisdiction    The Eleventh Amendment removed from federal jurisdiction cases in which citizens of one state were the plaintiffs and the government of another state was the defendant  It did not disturb federal jurisdiction in cases in which a state government is a plaintiff and a citizen of another state the defendant  The power of the federal courts extends both to civil actions for damages and other redress  and to criminal cases arising under federal law  The interplay of the Supremacy Clause and Article III has resulted in a complex set of relationships between state and federal courts  Federal courts can sometimes hear cases arising under state law pursuant to diversity jurisdiction  state courts can decide certain matters involving federal law  and a handful of federal claims are primarily reserved by federal statute to the state courts  for example  those arising from the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991   Both court systems thus can be said to have exclusive jurisdiction in some areas and concurrent jurisdiction in others  The U S  Constitution safeguards judicial independence by providing that federal judges shall hold office  during good behavior   in practice  this usually means they serve until they die  retire  or resign  A judge who commits an offense while in office may be impeached in the same way as the President or other officials of the federal government  U S  judges are appointed by the President  subject to confirmation by the Senate  Another Constitutional provision prohibits Congress from reducing the pay of any Article III judge  Congress is able to set a lower salary for all future judges that take office after the reduction  but may not decrease the rate of pay for judges already in office   Relationships between state and federal courts Separate from  but not entirely independent of  this federal court system are the court systems of each state  each dealing with  in addition to federal law when not deemed preempted  a state s own laws  and having its own court rules and procedures  Although state governments and the federal government are legally dual sovereigns  the Supreme Court of the United States is in many cases the appellate court from the State Supreme Courts  e g   absent the Court countenancing the applicability of the doctrine of adequate and independent State grounds   The Supreme Courts of each state are by this doctrine the final authority on the interpretation of the applicable state s laws and Constitution  Many state constitution provisions are equal in breadth to those of the U S  Constitution  but are considered  parallel   thus  where  for example  the right to privacy pursuant to a state constitution is broader than the federal right to privacy  and the asserted ground is explicitly held to be  independent   the question can be finally decided in a State Supreme Court the U S  Supreme Court will decline to take jurisdiction   A State Supreme Court  other than of its own accord  is bound only by the U S  Supreme Court s interpretation of federal law  but is not bound by interpretation of federal law by the federal court of appeals for the federal circuit in which the state is included  or even the federal district courts located in the state  a result of the dual sovereigns concept  Conversely  a federal district court hearing a matter involving only a question of state law  usually through diversity jurisdiction  must apply the substantive law of the state in which the court sits  a result of the application of the Erie Doctrine  however  at the same time  the case is heard under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence instead of state procedural rules  that is  the application of the Erie Doctrine only extends to a requirement that a federal court asserting diversity jurisdiction apply substantive state law  but not procedural state law  which may be different   Together  the laws of the federal and state governments form U S  law  Elections and voting Main article  Elections in the United States Suffrage  commonly known as the ability to vote  has changed significantly over time  In the early years of the United States  voting was considered a matter for state governments  and was commonly restricted to white men who owned land  Direct elections were mostly held only for the U S  House of Representatives and state legislatures  although what specific bodies were elected by the electorate varied from state to state  Under this original system  both senators representing each state in the U S  Senate were chosen by a majority vote of the state legislature  Since the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913  members of both houses of Congress have been directly elected  Today  partially due to the Twenty sixth Amendment  U S  citizens have almost universal suffrage from the age of 18  regardless of race  gender  or wealth  and both Houses of Congress are directly elected  The only exception to this is the disenfranchisement of convicted felons  and in some states former felons as well  Under the U S  Constitution  the national representation of territories and the federal district of Washington  D C   in Congress is limited  residents of the District of Columbia are subject to federal laws and federal taxes  but their only congressional representative is a non voting delegate  Residents of U S  territories have varying rights  for example  only some residents of Puerto Rico pay federal income taxes  though all residents must pay all other federal taxes  including import export taxes  federal commodity taxes and federal payroll taxes  including Social Security and Medicare   All federal laws that are  not locally inapplicable  are automatically the law of the land in Puerto Rico but their current representation in the U S  Congress is in the form of a Resident Commissioner  a nonvoting delegate  13  State  tribal and local governments Main articles  State governments of the United States  Tribal sovereignty in the United States  and Local government in the United States United States  showing states  divided into counties  parishes in Louisiana  boroughs in Alaska   Note that Alaska and Hawaii are shown at different scales  and that the Aleutian Islands and the uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands are omitted from this map  The state governments tend to have the greatest influence over most Americans  daily lives  The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the federal government from exercising any power not delegated to it by the States in the Constitution  as a result  states handle the majority of issues most relevant to individuals within their jurisdiction  Because state governments lack the power to print currency  they must raise revenue either through taxes or bonds  As a result  state governments tend to impose severe budget cuts at any time the economy is faltering  which are strongly felt by the public for which they are responsible  14  Each state has its own written constitution  government and code of laws  There are sometimes great differences in law and procedure between individual states  concerning issues such as property  crime  health and education  The highest elected official of each state is the Governor  Each state also has an elected state legislature  bicameralism is a feature of every state except Nebraska   whose members represent the voters of the state  Each state maintains its own state court system  In some states  supreme and lower court justices are elected by the people  in others  they are appointed  as they are in the federal system  As a result of the Supreme Court case Worcester v  Georgia  Indian tribes are considered  domestic dependent nations  that operate as sovereign governments subject to federal authority but  generally and where possible  outside of the influence of state governments  Hundreds of laws  executive orders and court cases have modified the governmental status of tribes vis   vis individual states  but the two have continued to be recognized as separate bodies  Tribal capacity to operate robust governments varies  from a simple council used to manage all aspects of tribal affairs  to large and complex bureaucracies with several branches of government  Tribes are empowered to form their own governments  with power resting in elected tribal councils  elected tribal chairpersons  or religiously appointed leaders  as is the case with pueblos   Tribal citizenship  and voting rights  is generally restricted to individuals of native descent  but tribes are free to set whatever membership requirements they wish  The institutions that are responsible for local government within states are typically town  city  or county boards  water management districts  fire management districts  library districts and other similar governmental units which make laws that affect their particular area  These laws concern issues such as traffic  the sale of alcohol and the keeping of animals  The highest elected official of a town or city is usually the mayor  In New England  towns operate in a direct democratic fashion  and in some states  such as Rhode Island and Connecticut  counties have little or no power  existing only as geographic distinctions  In other areas  county governments have more power  such as to collect taxes and maintain law enforcement agencies  Reception This section requires expansion  Henry J  Aaron of the Brookings Institution has described the U S  government as a system  in which minority interests can marshall numerous and powerful defenses to block major changes not supported by powerful and well mobilized majorities   15  See also Government of the United States portal   The template below  Link templates

See pp 14 15   also pay federal income taxes  In addition  because the cutoff point for income taxation is lower than that of the U S  IRS code  and because the per capita income in Puerto Rico is much lower than the average per capita income on the mainland  more Puerto Rico residents pay income taxes to the local taxation authority than if the IRS code were applied to the island  This occurs because  the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government has a wider set of responsibilities than do U S  State and local governments   See GAO gov   As residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security  Puerto Ricans are eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement  but are excluded from the Supplemental Security Income  SSI   Commonwealth of Puerto Rico residents  unlike residents of the
