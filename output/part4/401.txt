fenland farmer  and Lillie Bolland  4  He spent his  first 18 years  living  in a small village near Boston in the fens of Lincolnshire  England   but has  no memory of comics  much before the age of ten  4  When American comics began to be imported into England  c 1959  Bolland says that it  took a little while for me to discover them   but by 1960 he was intrigued by Dell Comics  Dinosaurus   which fed into a childhood interest in dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes  4  Comics including Turok  Son of Stone and DC s Tomahawk soon followed  and it was this burgeoning comics collection that would help inspire the young Bolland to draw his own comics 1  around the age of ten with ideas such as  Insect League   5  He recalls that   s uperheroes crept into my life by stealth   as he actively sought out covers featuring  any big creature that looked vaguely dinosaur like  trampling puny humans   4  This adolescent criteria led from Dinosaurus  and Turok via House of Mystery to  Batman and Robin  who  were  often  being harassed by big weird things  as were Superman  Aquaman  Wonder Woman  etc    4  Soon  family outings to Skegness became an excuse for the future artist to  trawl    round some of the more remote backstreet newsagents  for comics to store on an overflowing  bookcase I d made in school woodwork especially   4  As early as 1962  aged 11  Bolland remembers thinking that  Carmine Infantino s work on the Flash and Gil Kane s on Green Lantern and the Atom had a sophistication about it that I hadn t  previously  seen   4  He would later cite Kane and Alex Toth as  pinnacle s  of excellence   1  alongside  Curt Swan  Murphy Anderson  Syd Greene  Joe Kubert  Ross Andru  Mike Esposito  Nick Cardy and the under rated Bruno Premiani   whose influences showed in his  early crude stabs at drawing comics   4  The young Bolland did not rate Marvel Comics as highly as DC  feeling the covers cluttered and the paper quality crude  4  His appreciation of the artwork of Jack Kirby  he says  only materialised much later  through the eyes of a seasoned professional   4  He did however enjoy UK comics  including newspaper strips such as  Syd Jordan s Jeff Hawke  and  David Wright s Carol Day  6    and Valiant which featured  Eric Bradbury s Mytek the Mighty and Jesus Blasco s Steel Claw 7    4  Despite such a variety of inspirations  Bolland credits his eventual pursuance of art as a hobby and then vocation to a primary school art teacher  who  evidently said all the right things to me   3  Growing up as  and only child in a house without culture    Bolland says that his  mother and father had no use for art  literature or music    he embraced the late 1960s pop culture explosion of  pirate radio stations  music  particularly Frank Zappa      drug taking  psychedelia   peace and love    dropping out   the underground scene  Oz Magazine   and other aspects of hippy culture epitomised by underground comix such as Robert Crumb s Zap Comix  4  Having taken both O Level and A Level examinations in art  Bolland spent five years at art school  starting in 1969 4   learning graphic design and Art history  3  Learning to draw comics  however  was  more a self taught thing   with Bolland eventually writing a 15 000 word dissertation in 1973 on Neal Adams   an  artist  his teachers  had never heard of   1  3  He would later recall    It was during this time that I discovered the sheer range of comics and their history  All the British stuff I d missed was there to be discovered  I found the American greats  Foster  Herriman  Alex Raymond and Winsor McCay    Noel Sickles  Milt Caniff  Roy Crane  had all  I discovered  put down the basic building blocks of our  Art form   And there were the Europeans    Moebius  Manara  Breccia  Later the Filipinos Alex Ni o  Nestor Redondo  Alfredo Alcala  all were inspirational  None of this stuff was to be found in the art schools  During my five years in three art schools I never learnt a single thing about comics from any of my tutors   4     edit  UK career  edit  Fanzines and early work While at art school  Bolland drew and self published a couple of fanzines and his work was published in British underground magazines Friendz  International Times and OZ  8  In 1971  his friend Dave Harwood  took his first step into printed mass production with his RDH Comix   for which Bolland provided a cover  featuring Norwich Cathedral    9  Also in 1971  Time Out   an underground magazine 8  rapidly reinventing itself into  the biggest weekly listings magazine in London    gave Bolland his  first paid job  10  producing  a proper illustration of Jazz bassist Buddy Guy   8  While in Norwich  Bolland produced the first episodes of an adult Little Nemo in Slumberland parody entitled Little Nympho in Slumberland  and when he moved to London s Central School of Art and Design in 1973  he continued to produce  mostly full page  Little Nympho strips for a 50 copy fanzine entitled Suddenly at 2 o clock in the Morning  11  He also contributed a smaller  strip entitled  The Mixed Up Kid  to the Central School of Art s  college newspaper    the Galloping Maggot   12   edit  2000AD  Judge Death and Walter the Wobot In 1972  Bolland attended a comic convention at the Waverley Hotel in London  and met  a lot of the people who were key in the comics scene of the time   including Dez Skinn  Nick Landau  Richard Burton  Angus McKie and   crucially   Dave Gibbons  13  Bolland and Gibbons became firm friends  After finishing his college course  Bolland was hit with  the stark reality of unemployment  13  and on the advice of Gibbons 14  joined art agency Bardon Press Features   A few two page strips  for D C  Thomson resulted  but Bolland would refer to this period as his  lowest time   13  Bardon did however produce a client called Pikin which was  planning a bi weekly comic about an African superhero   Powerman  which was to be sold in Nigeria  1  13  Gibbons and Bolland were to draw alternate issues  Bolland s first issue was Powerman  2  1    and Bolland recalls that  soon Dave had drawn his entire story and I had produced just a few pages   13  This knowledge    that Dave could produce a page a day    and that I was going to have to do the same    was a shock  but proved to be  the very best kind of training ground   13  With comics purportedly being new to Nigeria  13  Bolland recalls this work being created specifically to be  really simple  six panels on a page and  all  the panels had to be numbered   15  Not only was this work   t he best way to learn the simple rules of comic book storytelling   but  better still  it was going someplace where nobody I knew could see it   13  He  drew around 300 pages of that very straightforward  simple to follow work  and I guess the storytelling flowed naturally from that   13  15  Even so  he  was always struggling to get the last eight or ten pages finished   and was occasionally helped by friends  both from his  Norwich School of Art days   Gibbons and future 2000 AD and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen artist Kevin O Neill  16  Bolland writes that starting with Powerman he  found regular employment drawing comics  one of which  Judge Dredd  in 1977 80  turned out to be quite a hit     4  In early 1977  Bardon agent Barry Coker called Gibbons and Bolland to the office and showed them  mock ups from a new science fiction comic I P C  was planning to publish   17  With Star Wars doing well at the box office  the time was ripe for a new SF comic  and Gibbons joined Carlos Ezquerra in  jumping into 2000AD feet first with issue 1  or Programme  later Prog 1     but meanwhile  Bolland  would have to keep drawing Powerman on  his  own   17 Powerman dropped to a monthly schedule  and Coker soon got Bolland  a cover on 2000AD in May  77 with Prog 11   7 May 1977  signed  Bollo    17  Bolland recalls of those early days that    You ll be surprised to hear that even though Judge Dredd had been in 2000AD since Prog 2 the editors weren t sure which of the interior characters would sell the comic best if that character was on the cover  Artists like me just came up with cover ideas and  if they liked them  we d draw the cover and they would write a one page text story based on it to go inside  These early covers of mine fall into that category   17    Other covers following  nearly a third of the first 30   as well as stand alone pages and some inking duties on Gibbons  Dan Dare  Already familiar with Nick Landau  acting editor   when another artist dropped out  Bolland was called directly to complete a Judge Dredd story in Prog 41  03 Dec 77  and soon was established as a regular artist on the series  18   From that point on   writes Bolland   either he  Landau  or his successor Steve MacManus called me direct whenever they wanted me to do a Dredd story   18  Dredd stories started as traditional UK comic stories  i e   six page one offs     Writers  Pat Mills and John Wagner seem ing  to spurn the American comic idea of continuing stories or  worse  the idea of a 2000AD continuity between characters   Bolland seeing this as a  strength    hav ing  one great new idea each week   19  Soon  though  the writers began to craft serials  and Bolland s distinct abilities with subtle facial expressions  dramatic lighting and the dynamic composition of page layout made him the perfect choice to draw the on going sagas  starting with  The Lunar Olympics   19  Bolland contributed artwork to such popular and seminal Judge Dredd story arcs as  Luna Period    The Cursed Earth    The Day the Law Died    The Judge Child Quest  and  Block Mania   As the Dredd stories rose in popularity  they  were moved so they started on the middle pages  with a colour double page spread  which Bolland  always struggled with  20  finding it  very difficult     trying  to fill that space most effectively   14  Ultimately the weekly deadlines meant that Bolland was unable to produce all episodes of the epic storylines himself  and the art chores on The Cursed Earth were split between Bolland and Mike McMahon  Bolland s early work on Judge Dredd was much influenced by McMahon  a talented newcomer whose idiosyncratic style was fueling the interest in the new character  Bolland thought McMahon was  terrific  the real ideas man on Dredd   but noted that McMahon s approach was  very impressionistic   while the  average comics reader  certainly at the time  does tend to prefer realism   14  15  Bolland therefore states that he  aped Mike s genius    and then reinterpreted  Dredd  in a style which actually borrowed a lot from the work of the American artists   14  retaining McMahon s  granite jawed  look but bringing a level of realism and fine detail to the character  which Mark Salisbury says  finally cemented the iconic image   15  As well as honing the look of the character and contributing to the highest profile early storylines  Bolland also created the look of two of the wider Dredd universe s most enduring characters  Judge Death  and the other three Dark Judges  and Judge Anderson  Later  Landau s Titan  decided they could repackage the Judge Dredd stories in an American comic format with new covers and sell it to America   and did under the evocative British brand  Eagle Comics   21  Bolland provided many of the covers for these compendium issues  21  Bolland  drew the first three episodes of the Judge Death story over the winter of 1979 80   as  just another villain in just another excellent John Wagner script   22  He doesn t  remember doing any sketches to get him right   the  outfit was described somewhat in the script    and details of it were heavily inspired by the look of Kevin O Neill s Nemesis the Warlock  22  Bolland was  he acknowledges   by far the slowest of the rotating Judge Death artists   opting to  take as long as I needed and do a half way decent job  rather than rushing  22  For the sequel  a  massive  for me  30 pages   2000AD  s editorial banked one off stories to give Bolland long enough to draw it all  22  When Nick Landau began  in 1981  Titan Books  reprints of Judge Dredd material  he  used this story non chronologically  to begin the series  22  Landau spent time paginating the book at Bolland s flat  and discovered that   s ome stories started or ended on the wrong page thereby leaving blank pages   as it was set to be  in effect  the first book exclusively of my work  the artist  gladly offered to add three full page pictures for the Cursed Earth volume and a new back cover for the first Judge Dredd volume  23  Walter the Wobot was an android with a speech impediment who served as Judge Dredd s personal servant robot  Created for light relief  Bolland notes that   t he great thing about the Judge Dredd strip was it s  sic  ability to slide seamlessly between gritty sci fi adventure  nasty gothic horror  spoofery  all the way to daft comedy   24  Walter s solo adventures    Walter the Wobot  Fwiend of Dwedd    were the latter style  24  Bolland drew all bar a couple of Walter s adventures  which appeared between Progs  50 61   67 68 and  84 85  with Ian Gibson drawing the first two episodes and Brendan McCarthy the last two   and says that he  was usually able to complete one in a day   24  He namechecks  the great Don Martin  as an artist he  shamelessly ripped off  for the human supporting characters  drawing most of the pages in Chiswick  1978  24   edit  Other UK work In between Dredd assignments Bolland drew horror strips for Dez Skinn s House of Hammer  having been introduced to the comic through another of the  fanboy in crowd   Trevor Goring  who drew  a comic strip version of the movie Plague of the Zombies   and asked Bolland to ink it  25  Soon  Bolland was asked to draw  Vampire Circus   dir  Robert Young  1972  comic version scripted by Steve Parkhouse   and  pile d  on the gore  for his first Hammer horror adaptation   although he found much of the  blood painted out  in the printed version  25  From the 1970s to the present  Bolland has also produced one off pieces of artwork for use as record  including one for The Drifters in 1975 26    paperback book  including the UK Titan editions of George R  R  Martin s Wild Cards anthologies 27   and magazine covers  including Time Out 10  and a every major comics publication   He continued to produce work for fanzines  including for Nick Landau s Comic Media News  28  and Arkensword and even  drew the hazard cards  for a board game called Maneater  29  He later  got to know the Games Workshop guys  Steve Jackson 30  and Ian Livingstone   and produced various  games related drawings  including a cover or two for Fighting Fantasy Adventure Game Books  31  and RPG scenario pamphlets  32  In 1977  Bolland was approached by Syd Jordan to ghost some episodes of Jordan s newspaper strip Jeff Hawke  33   Fellow fandom pro artist Paul Neary had  already done quite a few   33   Bolland drew 13 episodes  and  Syd touched up some of the faces  a few details here and there  to make them look a bit more like him   33  By this point   although the Express owned the rights to the strip  they were not printing it   but since it had a strong European following  these new episodes  Bolland believes   got collected in anthologies in French and Spanish   but not in the UK except briefly in  the fanzine Eureka   33  In 1985  as a known fan  Bolland was approached by Nick Landau to select stories and draw covers for two Titan collections of the strip  with a third design going unpublished  34  35  Bolland also contributed  A Miracle of Elisha  to Knockabout Comics  Old Bailey OZ Trial Special  written because Old Testament history had piqued the interest of Bolland when living near the British Museum  36  This page was later reprinted in the star studded  Moore  Hunt Emerson  Gaiman  Gibbons  Dave McKean  etc   Outrageous Tales From the Old Testament volume  although Bolland s name was left off the cover  37  Bolland produced a considerable amount of advertising work  initially because his agent  Barry Coker kept putting advertising jobs my way   including a number of ads for  Palitoy s Star Wars toys   38  He also drew some of the earliest pieces of advertising artwork for the science fiction and comic shop Dark They Were  and Golden Eyed  which ran in various Fanzines  Convention programmes and magazines such as Time Out and was commissioned by future Titan Distribution  amp  Forbidden Planet co founder Mike Lake  who was  working there at the time   c  1976  39  As well as the DTWAGE adverts  Bolland also contributed  alongside most of his peers  artwork to advertise  and or feature in programme booklets for the UK Comicon  starting c 1976  40  In 1978  Nick Landau  Mike Lake and Mike Luckman  took their comic distribution business into the highstreet   opening the first Forbidden Planet comics shop  for which Lake asked Bolland to produce the now famous  People like us shop at    FORBIDDEN PLANET  adverts  Bolland s artwork would also feature on the shops plastic bags  as well as T Shirts and  covers for their SF  comic and TV  amp  film catalogues   among other places  41  Later  when a branch of FP was opened in New York  and at a second location in London  Bolland  did ads for both of them   42   edit  DC Comics Main article  DC Comics Bolland was among the very first British comics creators  discovered  by the American comics industry  spearheading the so called  British Invasion  in 1979 80  Bolland recalls that his big break came when Joe Staton attended the Summer 1979 Comicon  and  needing somewhere to work  on Green Lantern  while in the UK  arranged to stay with the Bollands  43  Staton called his editor Jack Harris and told him that Bolland  a big Green Lantern fan  would  like to draw a Green Lantern cover   Harris agreed  43  Bolland s US career thus  started with a Green Lantern cover  Green Lantern  127  Apr  1980     after which he produced  a trickle of covers  including more Green Lantern covers over Ross Andru layouts 43   and stories  before gaining  regular employment   4  These stories included  in 1980 1   Certified Safe  in Mystery in Space 44  and  Falling Down to Heaven  in Madame Xanadu  DC s first attempt at marketing comics specifically to the  direct market  of fans and collectors  45  For editor Julius Schwartz  Bolland drew covers around which writers would craft stories  which included  a couple of Starro covers and the Superman Beastman cover  Superman  422  Aug  1986     44  Among his earliest interior work for DC was a chapter in Justice League of America  200  Mar  1982  alongside industry legends   and artistic heroes   Joe Kubert  Carmine Infantino and Gil Kane as well as Jim Aparo  George P rez and Dick Giordano  This gave the artist his  first stab at drawing Batman   44  Bolland feels that  after my cover  GL  127  worked out the people at DC turned their gaze on London    and particularly on the group of artists at 2000AD who had been weaned on the DC characters   46  He recalls that   after I was settled in at DC  scouts from that company came to our  Society of Strip Illustration  meetings to win over a few more of us   4  making a  formal invitation  at an SSI meeting  which saw  Dave Gibbons  Kevin O Neill     t hen Alan Davis and Mark Farmer   following the artists  Alan Grant  went across  and  at some point  a certain tall hairy writer from the Midlands   46  In 1982  DC editor Len Wein chose Bolland to be the artist on DC s Camelot 3000 12 issue limited series  with writer Mike W  Barr  47  The story  a  re working of the old Arthurian legend  dealing with the return of King Arthur to save England from an alien invasion in the Year 3000  not only  represents the single biggest body of work  by Bolland   and his only attempt to draw a monthly title   but was also the  first example of a DC  or otherwise  maxi series   2  Bolland wasn t initially familiar with the Arthurian legends  and initially conceived Merlin as  a comical character   48  His  first encounter with media hype   proved popular as he found himself  whisked off to San Diego and places and made a fuss of   48  Bolland was allowed to  pick between two inkers   but opted to ink his covers himself  48   Indeed  it was initially unpopular with him to allow a third party to ink his pencils  since he d previously  never had my work inked unless I was in dire straits   but  by the end I was quite pleased with the results   48   Reacting indignantly to being presented with Andru layouts for the first two Camelot 3000 covers  he       chose to ignore  the Andru design  completely and come up with my own unapproved design  Len Wein rejected it and told me to do the Ross Andru one  Grudgingly I drew the number one cover that made it onto the issue   but as a protest I reversed the letter N in my signature as a code to remind myself that my  artistic integrity  had been despoiled  I liked the backwards N enough to keep it from that day on   48    Camelot 3000 also became notorious for the lengthy delays between its final issues  Bolland recalls that he and DC  talked quite a bit about how long it would take me to do the series   and because the series was inked by a third party  initially by Bruce Patterson  then by Terry Austin   he started off  churning the pages out with great enthusiasm   2  49  As the series continued  however  Bolland became increasingly meticulous   trying to make the pages look better and better  not least because he  wanted the final parts of the story to  look  amazing   2  The added details he introduced into his famously detailed artwork caused significant delays in the final issues of the limited series  causing issues  8 11 to be released on a quarterly rather than monthly status  and the final issue to be cover dated nine months later than the penultimate issue  Bolland drew a pinup for Superman  400  Oct  1984  50  and its companion portfolio  51  In 1986  Bolland was one of several artists who contributed pages to the anniversary issue Batman  400  Oct  1986   52  his offering featuring villains Ra s Al Ghul and Catwoman  53  Around this time  Titan Books were  trying to launch a line of comics all written by Alan Moore   and  talks were underway to do a Batman Meets Judge Dredd one off by Alan and me   54  With these ideas kicking around in his head  and when  it became clear that  Camelot 3000  had sold reasonably well   DC editor Dick Giordano then asked Bolland what project he wanted to work on next  53  Bolland says     I thought about it in terms of who s my favourite writer at the moment  what hero I would really love to do  and which villain  I basically came up with Alan  Batman and the Joker  53    The result was the popular  influential 55  and controversial Batman  The Killing Joke  first published in 1988  Giordano s invitation led directly to Bolland working with writer Alan Moore to create a plausible background story for the premier Batman villain  the Joker  Bolland s Joker fascination stemmed in part from his having  recently seen the excellent silent movie The Man Who Laughs   and he therefore wanted to do a  Joker story with the Batman as a more distant  peripheral character   54  Although the story takes pains to stress that it is merely one possible  origin story   it has been widely accepted and adopted into DC continuity  and a central mutilation of a long running character had to be specially approved by editor Wein  54  Bolland notes that he saw  Judge Death  as  almost a dry run for drawing the Joker   but that this artistic similarity did not proclude difficulties setting in during the genesis of TKJ as  by the time Alan had finished Watchmen he had fallen out with DC to a certain extent     i n the end  he only continued to do Killing Joke as a favour to me   53  The 64 page prestige format one shot comic took a considerable amount of time to produce  53  Both Moore and Bolland are well known for their meticulous and time consuming work   both creators  then recently finished 12 issue maxiseries titles had seen delays   and Bolland made it clear that he  wanted to do the best possible job   53  even though it wasn t perhaps  quite what I d hoped to draw   54  He was aided by the laid back attitude taken by DC  who he says  seemed prepared to let me do it at my own pace   53  However  a change of editorship also affected the pace  The original editor  Len Wein left the company  and was replaced by Dennis O Neil  a  very hands off sort of guy   with whom Bolland only recalls having  one conversation  about the book  53  This atmosphere allowed Bolland not only the time to produce his best work  56  but also  to do lots of other pieces of work in and around it   53   Only when it was nearing completion in 1988  and the hype machine swung into action   did Bolland worry about deadlines  54  Bolland felt that there might have been the opinion that his book was  surplus to requirement  in the wake of Frank Miller s groundbreaking Batman  The Dark Knight Returns  and considers his title  almost just a piece of pure vanity publishing   53  He was  however  quite hurt when Moore confessed that  to him  it was just another Bat comic    for Bolland  it was this grand thing I had been building up to     wanting  it to be really special   53  Stung by Moore s criticism  Bolland was mortified by the colouring  and bemused not to have seen proofs pre publication  54  Having envisaged the flashback sequences in  black and white so you knew they were taking place at an earlier time   and instructing Watchmen colorist John Higgins to use  muted November colors   he found instead  garish    hideous glowing purples and pinks    and my precious Eraserhead esque flashback sequences swamped in orange   54  The 2008 published 20th anniversary edition of the book featured new colouring by Bolland  restoring his artistic intentions to the palate  Speaking c  2000  Bolland notes that his pursuit of  self written  strips meant that  since The Killing Joke I haven t drawn a single page that wasn t penned by me   53  Six years later he clarified that    Since then I haven t wanted to draw comics that anyone else has had a hand in  I d rather not work on a story I haven t written myself or one that will ultimately be colored by someone else  I have to earn a living  though  Covers are a safe place for me  If someone else s colors swamp my work then  who cares  It was only one page  I can move on     54    In 1996  in accordance with his hopes to only draw interior work written by him also  Bolland wrote and drew the story  An Innocent Guy  for the anthology Batman  Black and White  in which an otherwise normal inhabitant of Gotham City documents his plan to carry out the ultimate perfect crime and assassinate the Dark Knight Detective  Invited by Mark Chiarello to join  an impressive list of artists  for what Bolland terms  a nifty new project   Bolland jumped at the chance  57  Not only was he joining a fantastic complement of artists  but  better still   I could write my own story  No writer  No colorist  Just me   57  Drawing inspiration from  a masterpiece of a cover by my idol  Alex Toth   Bolland set out to  explore ideas    that in real life people don t come labelled  GOODIES  and  BADDIES  and that all of us walk a tightrope and could easily fall on either side   57  Intended as an    homage  to the Batman I loved as a kid   Bolland wrote in 2006 that    If anyone were to ask me what is the thing I ve done in my career that I m most pleased with  it would be this   57    Approached by Bat editor Mark Chiarello  again   Bolland was asked whether he would like to draw Batman covers for a new title  Gotham Knights  58  Jumping at the chance  he remarks that  there was a misunderstanding  resulting in his being unaware of the first issue being scheduled  resulting in  the superb Dave Johnson  drawing  1 instead  and Bolland joining at issue  2  58  Bolland s first two covers were colored by editor Chiarello  but from issue  5 to  47  his last  they were colored by the artist himself  58  As his run progressed   the job of getting a cover on Gotham Knights passed from Mark to a number of other people   and Bolland  found more and more of  his  first ideas for covers being turned down   58  Eventually  Bolland was  told  that he d  be off the book in a few issues time   but after discovering that upcoming covers featured Bane prominently  and not the Joker or Penguin as he d been hoping for for some time   Bolland  said I d go right away   58   edit  Covers Although his forays into interior artwork are almost universally acclaimed  Bolland is far more commonly seen as  just  a cover artist   although he notes that he has never decided to actually  pursue covers exclusively   having merely  branched off a little bit  from strip work  53  He cheerfully admits that he works slowly  and consequently finds covers easier to supply than whole story artwork  He also noted simply that he began to  concentrate on covers    really just because they were the jobs that I was offered   59  He adds that for artists like him   it s common knowledge they re going to say no  to strip work   so editors get them to do pin ups instead   59  Bolland has contributed covers   in many cases to complete runs arcs   to some of the more famous landmark comics of recent years  with his photo realistic work leaving an indelible impression on the titles for which he works  as the primary external reference image  His iconic covers are in high demand  although his work predominantly appears on titles published by DC Comics  Bolland now draws on a computer  eschewing pencil and paper  60  He cites the influence of Dave Gibbons  who  had got into computers himself  and    was really enthusing about them   60  Noting also that some colorists were increasingly using computer effects  seemingly arbitrarily   he decided  that if I didn t take control of the colouring process myself     those effects  would eventually transform the covers into something not my own   60  61  Starting in 1997  Bolland  bought all the gear  and spent ten frustrated months learning the ropes and ultimately finding the liberating  infinite ability to change  his now solely onscreen artwork  61  He states categorically that  in his opinion    t here is absolutely no difference between drawing on my Wacom tablet and drawing on a pad of paper   61  Having fully embraced the technology  Bolland has also produced a number of lessons tutorials on his Official Website demonstrating his complex techniques  He states that  while this leap means that he no longer produces any paper based artwork  a profitable sideline for many artists who sell on their original work to collectors    the pen and paper are gone for good   62  Bolland recalls that  in the wake of The Killing Joke  he  was offered a lot of work   but didn t feel ready to make a long commitment  63  So  instead     a fter Killing Joke  DC asked me to do the covers on Animal Man  and I said fine  expecting it to be maybe ten or so  I ended up doing sixty three  It became almost habitual  and it did mean that there would at least be something new of mine out there to look at   59     edit  Animal Man The first 63 issues of Animal Man featuring Bolland s artwork covered the tenures of writers Grant Morrison  Peter Milligan  Tom Veitch and Jamie Delano  with Bolland s images maintaining a continuity of style and imagery while the interior work underwent several changes of style and storyline  64  Initially  he recalls that his cover images derived directly from the script  59  He would  go through and find a scene that looked as if it would make a good cover   or  find a particular hook that cleverly summed up what s going on inside the book   59  This included the incorporation of photographs into the later covers of Morrison s tale of metafiction and deus ex machina author input  With the  post Morrison  move of Animal Man to DC s new  Mature Readers  imprint Vertigo  Bolland notes that the covers moved to  full color painted covers  with issue  57  65  These of his covers were  a mixture of ink linework  color washes  airbrush and then  eventually  areas painted in poster color by my wife  Rachel   which ultimately saw her have significant input on some covers  with Bolland acknowledging that  some of the last Animal Man covers were more her than me   65  Describing the art of good covers  Bolland remarks that     y ou really have to be constantly thinking of ways that the image on the cover will intrigue and lure in the potential punter  It helps to try and imagine your cover is in a whole bank of thirty or more and you need it to stand out   59    Happy coincidence also plays its part  as when a time travel story arc saw Bolland s work coincide with the plot in such a way that he was able to produce a recreated cover from an alternate angle to shed new light on an initially inconsequential image  60   edit  The Invisibles Main article  The Invisibles Bolland s covers adorn the whole second and third volumes of Grant Morrison s The Invisibles 64  and his depictions of the main characters are widely reprinted as the definitive images  despite them all having been realised by other artists   and often drawn by several before Bolland entered the picture  With this title  the artist remarks  the subject matter is more complicated   necessitating his  working a lot of strange symbolism and subliminal messages into the cover designs  to create  an image that puzzles to a degree and is layered with elements of surrealism   59  Asked to take over from Sean Hughes and  do the covers on volume two  by editor Shelly Roeberg  Bolland found her to be  the dream editor   effusive with praise and  very specific about what she required   66  Generally  Bolland recalls  she was enthusiastic about my ideas   although Morrison had  creator s approval  on all designs  66  Finding that he had a rapport with  and the trust of  his editor  Bolland thinks that these factors  resulted in some of  his  most experimental work   66  Newly embracing the use of a computer  Bolland cites The Invisibles Vol 2  11 as his earliest computer assisted piece of artwork  using it to  insert    a computer generated background behind a severed hand   67  For the third series     we  Bolland and Morrison  talked about trying to make the covers look different in some way  and when DC decided to number the issues backwards  from 12 to 1  to count down to the Millennium   that set me thinking  I remember seeing Peter Greenaway s film Drowning By Numbers  in which they had these numbers placed subtley in every scene  and I really liked that idea  So I began to include elements of the issue number    always trying to think of ways to hide it  or make it an integral design element   59    The covers for the third volume of The Invisibles were  done on the computer   in part because  Vertigo were paying for  painted  covers and  Bolland  felt  he  had to deliver something more than line and flat color   68  The experimental nature of the twelve covers was assisted by the fact that  says Bolland  neither I nor Shelly had seen that issue s script   68  For the trade paperback covers  Bolland  was determined to make each one weider than the last   and so created a Francis Bacon inspired  fleshy mass  dubbed  The Blobby Man   with a typewriter  for Entropy in the UK  68  Having convinced Karen Berger  Editor in chief of Vertigo  and Shelly Roeberg that it was a good idea  the artist recalls that  Shelly rang up and  rather than telling me how wonderful I was  said that when she saw it she nearly lost her lunch  I was asked to turn his skin color from flesh to blue to tone him down a bit   68  For the final Invisible Kingdom TPB cover  Bolland produced  a cover containing 12 small alternative Invisibles covers   which  took a long time to do   68  Likening the process to creating  a mini comic strip   Bolland says that  if any detail made any sense it had to be changed to something that didn t   68  Bolland s style includes the initial  rough  outline stage  making it easy for the publisher  and  in some cases  the writer  to  sign off  on his designs  69  In the case of The Invisibles  however  although Morrison officially had  final approval on the cover designs   Bolland describes him as  very generous about my work   saying that  it s not his job to actually come up with the idea   60  In selected cases  however  Bolland would ask for ideas  and in one specific case  Shelly  Roeberg   the editor    did once relay that Grant wanted an arm coming out of the water holding a gun on the cover of the last issue   69  Bolland admits  I don t know exactly why  I just supplied it   60   edit  Wonder Woman Main article  Wonder Woman Bolland also contributed a large number of covers to Wonder Woman  beginning with William Messner Loebs s first issue   63  June 1992 70   after that author took over writer  and artist  George P rez s 1987 post Crisis relaunch  Bolland recalls his time drawing Wonder Woman fondly  as one of the few occasions he actually sought work rather than being sought for work  He recalls    I usually sit at home optimistically hoping that people love me enough to ring me and offer me work  The end result is that most of the time I m doing what other people want and not what I want  Wonder Woman was an exception  I happened to mention to Tom Peyer  my editor on Animal Man  that I d love to draw Wonder Woman covers     a t the time  despite her long history at DC  her iconic appearance  even her cult TV series  she wasn t a character that A list artists were lining up to draw  Well  I wasn t an A list artist  so I was keen to have a crack at her   71    Bolland s first cover saw Diana next to the headline   The Stunning return of comics  greatest heroine   speaking directly to the reader the words     Miss me   70  Bolland s covers over the next 30 plus issues laid the visual groundwork for the character subsequently reworked by writer artist John Byrne  and saw Bolland illustrate up to and including the centennial issue  100  72  To prepare for his work  Bolland  clipped pictures of the most beautiful women of the time   Christie Turlington  Stephanie Seymour  etc   saying that he was predominantly interested in their faces   The body I generally made up    71  Interested particularly in drawing the costume  which he feels  has to be one of the sexiest in comics   he soon found the character removed from her normal costume in the storyline   defeating  for me  the whole point   71  For her return to her famous costume  Bolland produced one of his best known images  the Britannia esque pose from Wonder Woman  72  Mar  1993   73  With typical modesty  he says that   i mages like that    usually arise when you re completely stuck for an idea   71  The image was so iconic that it was released as a poster and later turned into a statue  Shortly thereafter  Diana underwent another costume change   this time designed by Bolland  and mostly drawn on the interior pages by Mike Deodato  71  The black costume was roundly disliked  even by its designer  Bolland  who philosophically says only that  it was what was asked for at the time   and   aside from Camelot 3000   is  the only occasion  he was asked to design a costume  71  The new costume   black hotpants  halter top  straight hair  which Bolland did like  and  WW  emblazoned jacket   was based  Bolland thinks   on a Versace outfit I saw Cindy Crawford wearing in an issue of Vogue   74   edit  Other cover work A rare Marvel cover for Hellstorm  Prince Of Lies  16  Marvel  July 1994  Bolland notes that while he tends not to reuse cover ideas  he does occasionally produce  what I like to think of as homages to my own covers   60  Particularly  for  the first issue of the Eagle Judge Dredd comic    which repackaged 2000AD stories for the American market   on which the positioning of the figures echoed similar covers Bolland had drawn  two or three times for different companies with different characters   60  In addition to his landmark runs on Animal Man and The Invisibles  Bolland has also produced lengthy runs on covers for Geoff Johns  The Flash  from roughs by series editor Joey Cavalieri 75   and the Batman anthology series Batman  Gotham Knights  as well as assorted issues of Tank Girl  for original UK publication Deadline and the two subsequent Vertigo miniseries Tank Girl  The Odyssey and Tank Girl  Apocalypse   Superman  Green Lantern  Batman and many more  including a number of oneshots and miniseries for DC s offshoot Vertigo  Bolland is currently the cover artist on Vertigo s Fables spin off Jack of Fables  replacing previous cover artist James Jean  Bolland s covers also grace the DC Vertigo trade paperback collections of Grant Morrison s Doom Patrol  although he only produced  a couple  of covers for the individual issues  He recalls that he  turned in quite a few roughs  but  disappointingly for me  they were often rejected   previous cover artist Simon  The Biz  Bisley being  a hard act to follow   76  Long standing familiarity with DC characters and staff  coupled with high demand have combined with other factors to mean that the vast majority of Bolland s work has been for DC Comics  In The Art of Brian Bolland  he also mentions in passing that a bad experience with a Marvel UK Hulk cover and a later oddity with a She Hulk cover featuring Howard the Duck have given him a mild  phobia about Marvel     and  the laws of the production line  that overrule  whatever it is I have to give   77  He has however  produced odd covers for Marvel  First Comics  Continuity Comics  Eclipse Comics  New Comics and a dozen other companies  large and small  as well as book  magazine and record covers  For Dark Horse Comics  Bolland has produced several diverse covers  including a couple for Michael Chabon s The Amazing Adventures of the Escapist at the behest of editor Diana Schutz  78  He recalls that  the cover for number ten was done in the style of Herg  s Tintin    but the book was cancelled after number eight   78  Bolland is noted by some for his use of bondage imagery  although in a humorous self referential comment  he quotes this  fact   cited as from Wikipedia   and states that he is  unsure  of the sentiment s accuracy  79  He notes that  I can only think off hand of a few occasions when I ve drawn bondage  A few Wonder Woman covers perhaps  a Flash cover  a 2000 AD cover  a Mr  Mamoulian page    but that s all that I can remember out of many hundreds of images   79  In 2006 s The Art of Brian Bolland  he does suggest that  I trace my mild bondage fetish back to a book of Bible stories that must have been given to my father as a Sunday school gift when he was a child   wherein  was a picture of Shadrach  Meshach and Abednigo  sic    11  Such Biblical imagery was bolstered in 1971 by a book bought in Paris  called Les Filles de Papier     a  large part of  which  was taken up with comic strips about women tied up in fiendish and excruciating positions by mad robots    it was just jaw droppingly bonkers    and yet    there was something rather appealing about it   11 The Art of Brian Bolland also features a separate  Nudes  section  mostly created for the purpose of  trying out a different inking technique or trying to work out the figure from a difficult angle   80   Only three of the nude sketches involve scenes of bondage    edit  Other comics work In addition to his early forays into full interior strip art  and his later focus on covers  Bolland has also produced a number of short   often single pages   strips  numerous pin ups and a pair of on going  occasional  humour strips  These latter feature Bolland as writer artist  his now preferred method of working  53  Most notable are Bolland s two  personal projects   Mr  Mamoulian and The Actress and the Bishop  all appearances of which strips were collected in the book Bolland Strips   Palmano Bennet Knockabout Comics  2005   Bolland Strips  stemmed from a suggestion by Josh Palmano  owner of Gosh Comics in London  and also involved in publishing company Knockabout Comics  to collect all instances of Bolland s two strips and Steve Moore s  Zirk  story  80  Bolland had other thoughts  and suggested including an undrawn 20 page story called  The Actress  amp  the Bishop and the Thing in the Shed   written 18 years previously   and two stories written and illustrated by him for Vertigo Comics  80  After negotiations with DC  the two stories    Princess  amp  the Frog   from Heartthrobs  and  The Kapas   from Strange Adventures  were included alongside six limited edition  ditions D esse prints  80   edit  Mr  Mamoulian Among Bolland s other works is the Robert Crumb esque semi autobiographical stream of consciousness humour strip Mr  Mamoulian  81  which was first printed in Paul Gravett s UK pro zine Escape and later brought to the US in issues of the Dark Horse title Cheval Noir and the Caliber Comics anthology Negative Burn  82  Bolland recalled that the origins of the character lay in him  contemplating middle age  on his 36th birthday  and experimenting with drawing  whatever came into my head   82  The name echoes the character s mammalian look   lie a hedgehog    although Bolland acknowledges that Armenian American film director Rouben Mamoulian may also have provided an inspiration on the name front  82  Noting his enjoyment of Berke Breathed s Bloom County  Bolland s own strip didn t  have a funny line to end each page  because I wasn t always in a funny mood   82  Thus the strip became an  expos  of the inner me  drawn because  I felt like it     n ot to deadline   as a forum to explore and express  various interests of mine  various philosophical notions  personal neuroses   82  Designed to be read individually   indeed  early publication in Escape was in  no particular order    gradually it became clear that a mildly self referential  chronological narrative was taking shape    a plot that would come to a shock conclusion on page 96   and then continue  possibly  to volume two   82  Bolland writes in 2006 that   a fter a while  Nick Landau of Titan Books showed an interest and offered to act as my agent   82  Through Landau  Bolland saw his strip published across Europe in publications including Linus  Cimoc and  in Sweden  Pox  82  Such widespread exposure had its downside  when the original artwork went missing  meaning that   s ubsequent prints of Mamoulian have  had to be  made from  Bolland s  photocopies   82  Disenchanted by the loss of  more of  his artwork  and with  European interest    waning   Bolland  lost interest in doing more   82  Subsequent to the collection Bolland Strips   however  interest from Negative Burn  now published by Desperado Publishing   has coaxed new pages out of  the artist  82   edit  The Actress and the Bishop Bolland s other  personal project  is his occasional strip The Actress and the Bishop  83  This strip s origins date back to 1985  when Frederick Manzano commissioned Bolland to  draw 6 plates in my own portfolio bearing my name  for  ditions D esse  a  small Paris based comic store cum publishers  and Bolland drew in one of the six plates an elderly Bishop  whose face echoed  shamelessly  the work of Alberto Breccia 84   and a femme fatale Actress  85  Bolland was subsequently approached by Garry Leach and Dave Elliot  who  were launching a new comic anthology called A1   86  They asked Bolland to draw   and write    a few pages for the first issue   and Bolland recalls that it  was the first time I d been commissioned to write and draw anything   86  Actively seeking to write a story that wouldn t  fit into any identifiable genre   Bolland found the description  Whimsy  reached by Leach and Elliot to be very apt  and  rooted in the Englishness  of the artists life  86  Written in rhyming couplets  the pair  look like the punchline of a smutty joke   but their creator instead  wanted the reader to see them in a benign and non judgemental light    the antithesis of  Benny Hill  Frankie Howerd  Oo er  Mrs       rather  like the owl and the pussycat setting sail in a pea green boat   86  Three pages in A1  1 were followed by another three in A1  3  while a  longer story with 110 verses    gathered dust for 17 years  until publication in the compendium hardback Bolland Strips   86   edit  The Art of Brian Bolland In 2006 a comprehensively sizable retrospective of Bolland s work was published under the title The Art of Brian Bolland  featuring contextualising references and copious text   33 500 words 87    written by the artist alongside hundreds of pieces of artwork and rare photographs  The Art of Brian Bolland covers all of the artists  work to date  under an introduction from close friend Dave Gibbons  an autobiographical essay and sections ranging from his  Influences   featuring near unseen examples of Bolland s childhood art   through each of the decades from the 1960s to the present  The book also showcases several of Bolland s own photographs taken in Asia and Russia over twenty years of travelling   edit  Non comics work An accomplished photographer  examples of Bolland s work are  for example  included in the Image Desperado book The Art of Brian Bolland   as of May 2008  Bolland noted on his website that he is  working on a book about a week I spent in Burma in 1988   88   Some photographs taken by Bolland in Burma are reprinted in the Image published retrospective The Art of Brian Bolland  89   Much in demand for advertisements  Bolland has produced work down the years for bookshops   including pioneering UK Sci Fi Comics sellers such as Dark They Were  and Golden Eyed 39  and Forbidden Planet   and film festivals  including a poster for BFI Southbank s July August 2008 Comic Book Movies series 90    His work has appeared on the covers of  and inside  numerous publications over the decades  ranging from fanzines to several covers for London based magazine Time Out and other professional  internationally sold magazines  Bolland has also produced posters for local theatre groups  amateur stage productions  most notably for his local  village panto  production of Beauty and the Beast in 2004  91   edit  Personal life Bolland married his girlfriend  illustrator and sometime collaborator Rachel Birkett in 1981  92  She later gave up illustration  to become a cook in a vegetarian restaurant  93  although she has since assisted her husband with his work  acting as colorist  inker  co artist and ghost  The two have a son  Harry  21   edit  Awards  edit  Wins Bolland and his work have received considerable
