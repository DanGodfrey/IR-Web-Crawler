SummersSunspotWarlockWarpathWolverineX Man Roster See List of X Men members The X Men are a superhero team in the Marvel Comics Universe  They were created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby  and first appeared in The X Men  1  September 1963   The basic concept of the X Men is that under a cloud of increasing anti mutant sentiment  Professor Xavier created a haven at his Westchester mansion to train young mutants to use their powers for the benefit of humanity  and to prove mutants can be heroes  1  Xavier recruited Cyclops  Iceman  Angel  Beast  and Marvel Girl  calling them  X Men  because they possess special powers due to their possession of the  X gene   a gene which normal humans lack and which gives mutants their abilities  Early on  however  the  X  in X Men stood for  extra  power which normal humans lacked  It was also alluded to that mutations occurred as a result of radiation exposure  The first issue also introduced the team s archenemy  Magneto  who would continue to battle the X Men for decades throughout the comic s history  both on his own and with his Brotherhood of Mutants  introduced in issue  4   The X Men universe also includes such notable heroes as Wolverine  Storm  Colossus  Nightcrawler  Shadowcat  Rogue  Psylocke  Gambit and Emma Frost  Besides the Brotherhood of Mutants  other villains that the X Men have fought include the Sentinels  Apocalypse  Mister Sinister  and the Hellfire Club  The X Men comics have been adapted into other media  including animated television series  video games  and a commercially successful series of films  Contents 1 Publication history 1 1 1960s 1 2 1970s 1 3 1980s 1 4 1990s 1 5 2000s 1 6 2010s 2 World of the X Men 2 1 Fictional places 3 Other versions 4 Reflecting social issues 5

devised the series title after Marvel publisher Martin Goodman turned down the initial name   The Mutants   stating that readers would not know what a  mutant  was  2  Within the Marvel Universe  the X Men are widely regarded to have been named after Professor Xavier himself  Xavier however claims that the name  X Men  was never chosen to be a self tribute  3  The name is also linked to the  X Gene   an unknown gene that causes the mutant evolution  4   edit  1960s Early X Men issues introduced the team s archenemy Magneto and his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants featuring Mastermind  Quicksilver  Scarlet Witch  and Toad  The comic focused on a common human theme of good versus evil and later included storylines and themes about prejudice and racism  all of which have persisted throughout the series in one form or another  The evil side in the fight was shown in human form and under some sympathetic beginnings via Magneto  a character who was later revealed to have survived Nazi concentration camps only to pursue a hatred for normal humanity  His key followers  Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch  were Roma  gypsies   Only one new member of the X Men was added  Mimic Calvin Rankin  5  but soon left due to his temporary loss of power  6  The title lagged in sales behind Marvel s other comic franchises  In 1969  writer Roy Thomas and illustrator Neal Adams rejuvenated the comic book and gave regular roles to two recently introduced characters  Havok Alex Summers  who had been introduced by Roy Thomas before Adams began work on the comic  and Lorna Dane  later called Polaris  created by Arnold Drake and Jim Steranko   However  these later X Men issues failed to attract sales and Marvel stopped producing new stories with issue  66  later reprinting a number of the older comics as issues  67 93  7   edit  1970s In Giant Size X Men  1  1975   writer Len Wein and artist Dave Cockrum introduced a new team that then starred in a revival of The X Men  beginning with issue  94  This new team  however  differed greatly from the original  Unlike in the early issues of the original series  the new team was not made up of teenagers and they also had a more diverse background  Each was from a different country with varying cultural and philosophical beliefs  and all were already well versed in using their mutant powers  several being experienced in combat  The  all new  all different X Men  8  were led by Cyclops from the original team and consisted of the newly created Colossus  from the Soviet Union   Nightcrawler  from West Germany   Storm  from Kenya   and Thunderbird  a Native American from the Apache nation   along with three previously introduced characters  Banshee  from Ireland   Sunfire  from Japan   and Wolverine  from Canada   who eventually became the breakout character on the team and  in terms of comic sales and appearances  the most popular X Men character  A revamped Jean Grey soon rejoined the X Men as the popular Phoenix  Angel  Beast  Havok  and Polaris also made significant guest appearances  The revived series was illustrated by Cockrum  and later by John Byrne  and written by Chris Claremont  Claremont became the series  longest running contributor  9  The run met with critical acclaim and produced such early storylines as the death of Thunderbird  the return of the Sentinels and the emergence of Phoenix  the saga of the Starjammers and the fight for control of the M Kraan Crystal  the resurrection of Garokk the Petrified Man  the introduction of Alpha Flight 10  and the Proteus saga  Other characters introduced during this time include Amanda Sefton  Multiple Man  Mystique  and Moira MacTaggert with her genetic research facility on Muir Island   edit  1980s This section  except for one

began with the comic s best known story arc  the Dark Phoenix Saga  which saw Phoenix manipulated by the illusionist Mastermind and becoming corrupted with an overwhelming lust for power and destruction as the evil Dark Phoenix  Other important storylines included Days of Future Past  the saga of Deathbird and the Brood  the discovery of the Morlocks  the invasion of the Dire Wraiths and The Trial of Magneto  as well as X Men  God Loves  Man Kills  the partial inspiration for the 2003 movie X2  X Men United  11  By the early 1980s  X Men was Marvel s top selling comic title  The growing popularity of Uncanny X Men and the rise of comic book specialty stores led to the introduction of a number of ongoing spin off series nicknamed  X Books   The first of these was The New Mutants  soon followed by Alpha Flight  X Factor  Excalibur  and a solo Wolverine title  This plethora of X Men related titles led to the rise of crossovers  sometimes called  X Overs    story lines which would overlap into several X Books  Notable crossovers of the time included the Mutant Massacre  Fall of the Mutants  and Inferno  Throughout the decade  Uncanny X Men was written solely by Chris Claremont  and illustrated for long runs by John Byrne  Dave Cockrum  Paul Smith  John Romita  Jr   and Marc Silvestri  Additions to the X Men during this time were Kitty Pryde Shadowcat  Dazzler  Forge  Longshot  Psylocke  Rogue  Rachel Summers Phoenix  and Jubilee  In a controversial move  Professor X relocated to outer space to be with Lilandra  Majestrix of the Shi ar Empire  in 1986  Magneto then joined the X Men in Xavier s place and became the director of the New Mutants  This period also included the emergence of the Hellfire Club  the arrival of the mysterious Madelyne Pryor  and the villains Apocalypse  Mister Sinister  Mojo  and Sabretooth   edit  1990s The multiple  interlocking covers of X Men vol  2   1  1991   Art by Jim Lee  In 1991  Marvel revised the entire lineup of X Books  centered on the launch of a second X Men series  simply titled X Men  With the return of Xavier and the original X Men to the team  the roster was split into two strike forces  Cyclops   Blue Team   chronicled in X Men  and Storm s  Gold Team   in Uncanny X Men   Its first issues were written by longstanding X Men writer Chris Claremont and drawn and co plotted by Jim Lee  Retailers pre ordered this book at 8 million copies  but probably sold closer to 3 million copies  12  Another new X book released at the time was X Force  featuring the characters from The New Mutants  led by Cable  it was written by Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza  Internal friction soon split the X books  creative teams  In a controversial move  X Men editor Bob Harras sided with Lee  and Uncanny X Men artist Whilce Portacio  over Claremont in a dispute over plotting  Claremont left after only three issues of X Men  ending his 16 year run as X Men writer  13  Marvel replaced Claremont briefly with John Byrne  who scripted both books for a few issues  Byrne was then replaced by Nicieza and Scott Lobdell  who would take over the majority of writing duties for the X Men until Lee s own departure months later when he and several other popular artists  including former X title artists Liefeld  Portacio  and Marc Silvestri  would leave Marvel to form Image Comics  Jim Lee s X Men designs would be the basis for much of the X Men animated series and action figure line as well as several Capcom video games  The 1990s saw an even greater number of X books with numerous ongoing series and miniseries running concurrently  Notable story arcs of this time are  The X Tinction Agenda  in 1990   The Muir Island Saga  in 1991   X Cutioner s Song  in 1992   Fatal Attractions  in 1993   Phalanx Covenant  in 1994   Legion Quest   Age of Apocalypse  in 1995   Onslaught  in 1996  and  Operation  Zero Tolerance  in 1997  There were many new popular additions to the X Men including Cable  Bishop  and Gambit   who became one of the most popular X Men  rivaling even Wolverine in size of fanbase   but many of the later additions to the team came and went  Joseph  Maggott  Marrow  Cecilia Reyes  and a new Thunderbird   Xavier s New Mutants grew up and became X Force  and the next generation of students began with Generation X  featuring Jubilee and other teenage mutants led and schooled by Banshee and former villainess Emma Frost at her Massachusetts Academy  In 1998  Excalibur and X Factor ended and the latter was replaced with Mutant X  starring Havok stranded in a parallel universe  Marvel launched a number of solo series  including Deadpool  Cable  Bishop  X Man  and Gambit  but few of the series would survive the decade   edit  2000s In the 2000s  Claremont returned to Marvel and was put back on the primary X Men titles during the Revolution event  He was soon removed from the two flagship titles in early 2001 and created his own spin off series  X Treme X Men  which debuted a few months after his departure  X Men had its title changed at this time to New X Men and new writer Grant Morrison took over  This era is often referred to as the Morrison era  due to the drastic changes he made to the series  beginning with  E Is For Extinction   where a new villainess  Cassandra Nova  destroys Genosha  killing sixteen million mutants  Morrison also brought reformed ex villainess Emma Frost into the primary X Men team  and opened the doors of the school by having Xavier  out  himself to the public about being a mutant  The bright spandex costumes that had become iconic over the previous decades were also gone  replaced by black leather street clothes reminiscent of the uniforms of the X Men movies  Morrison also added a new character  Xorn  who would figure prominently in the climax of the writer s run  In the meantime  Ultimate X Men was launched  set in Marvel s revised imprint  Chuck Austen also began his controversial run on Uncanny X Men  Notable additions to the X Men have been Chamber  Emma Frost  Husk  Northstar  Armor  Pixie  and Warpath  During this decade former villains such as Juggernaut  Lady Mastermind  Mystique  and Sabretooth became members of the X Men for various lengths of time  Several short lived spin offs and miniseries started featuring several X Men in solo series  such as Emma Frost  Gambit  Mystique  Nightcrawler  and Rogue  Another book  Exiles  started at the same time and concluded in December 2007 but with a new book in January 2008   New Exiles  written by Chris Claremont  Cable and Deadpool s books were also rolled into one book  called Cable  amp  Deadpool  A third core X Men title was also introduced called Astonishing X Men  written by Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon  following Morrison s departure  Another X Book titled New X Men  Academy X took its place focusing on the lives of the new young mutants at the Institute  This period included the resurrections of Colossus and Psylocke  a new death for Jean Grey  who later returned temporarily in the X Men  Phoenix   Endsong miniseries  as well as Emma Frost becoming the new headmistress of the Institute  a position that was formerly Jean Grey s before her death  The Institute formerly ran as a large scale school  until the depowering of most of the mutant population  It now serves as a safe haven to those mutants who are still powered  and as the home of the X Men  The 2007 2008 Messiah Complex crossover saw the destruction of the Xavier Institute and the disbanding of the X Men  Out of the crossover spun the new volumes of X Force  following the team led by Wolverine  and Cable  following Cable s attempts at protecting the Messiah child  X Men vol 2 was renamed into X Men  Legacy and will focus on Professor Xavier  Rogue and Gambit  The main team later reformed in Uncanny X Men  500  with the X Men now operating out of a new base in San Francisco under Cyclops s leadership  14 Uncanny X Men returned to its roots as the flagship title for the X Franchise and served as the umbrella under which the various X Books co exist  A crossover between X Force and Cable series entitled Messiah War  written by Craig Kyle and Chris Yost  commenced in March 2009 and served as a second part in the trilogy that began with Messiah Complex  Matt Fraction also wrote a Dark Avengers Uncanny X Men crossover  Utopia  running through summer 2009  as a part of the larger Dark Reign storyline  2009 also saw the beginning of the new New Mutants volume written by Zeb Wells  with the limited series X Infernus serving as prologue  The new volume saw some of the more prominent members of the original team reunited  The end of 2009 and the Nation X storyline saw the X Men s longtime archnemesis  Magneto  renouncing his villainous ways and joining the X Men  which Cyclops allowed  15  This was much to the dismay of other members of the X Men  such as Beast  who left the team in disgust  16  Magneto began to work with Namor to transform Utopia into a homeland for both mutants and Atlanteans  17  Starting with issue  226  Rogue became the main character of X Men  Legacy  The new series direction began in the X Men  Legacy Annual after the conclusion of Utopia  X Force  New Mutants  and X Men  Legacy were also involved in Necrosha  a crossover in which Selene resurrected all the mutants killed in the Genosha massacre  X Force contained the main storyline  while the other series handled the consequences of the prologue one shot  Notable story arcs of this decade are  Revolution   2000    Eve of Destruction    E Is For Extinction   2001    Planet X    Here Comes Tomorrow    Gifted    2004  X Men  Phoenix   Endsong   House of M    Decimation   2005   Deadly Genesis  2005 2006    Endangered Species   2007    Messiah Complex   2007 2008    Divided We Stand   2008    Manifest Destiny   2008 2009   X Infernus   Messiah War    Utopia    Nation X  and  Necrosha   2009   The X Men were also involved in the  Secret Invasion  storyline   edit  2010s Notable story arcs of this decade include the 2010 storyline  Second Coming   which is based on plot threads from  Necrosha  and  House of M    18  19   Age of X   and  Schism   2011   as well as the 2012 event  Avengers vs  X Men    In the aftermath of the Schism series  the fallout between Wolverine and Cyclops will lead to the revival and rebuilding of the original X Mansion by Wolverine  with support from Kitty Pryde  Iceman  and Beast  Enrollment in The Jean Grey School for Higher Learning will begin in October 2011  in  Wolverine and the X Men  1    edit  World of the X Men Main article  History of the X Men comics See also  Mutant  Marvel Comics  The X Men exist in the Marvel Universe with other characters portrayed in Marvel Comics series  As such  it is unsurprising that they often meet characters from other series  and the global nature of the mutant concept means the scale of stories can be highly varied  The X Men fight everything ranging from mutant thieves to galactic threats  Historically  the X Men have been based in the Xavier Institute  near Salem Center  in north east Westchester County  NY  and are often depicted as a family  The X Mansion is often depicted with three floors and two underground levels  To the outside world  it had acted as a higher learning institute until the 2000s  when Xavier was publicly exposed as a mutant at which point it became a full mutant boarding school  Xavier funds a corporation aimed at reaching mutants worldwide  though it ceased to exist following the  Decimation   The X Men benefit greatly from state of the art technology  For example  Xavier is depicted tracking down mutants with a device called Cerebro which amplifies his powers  the X Men train within the Danger Room  first depicted as a room full of weapons and booby traps  now as generating holographic simulations  and the X Men travel in their widely recognized and iconic Blackbird jet   edit  Fictional places The X Men introduced several fictional locations which are regarded as important within the shared universe in which Marvel Comics characters exist  Asteroid M  an asteroid made by Magneto  a mutant utopia and training facility off of the Earth s surface  Genosha  an island near Madagascar and a longtime apartheid regime against mutants  Given control by the U N  to Magneto until the E Is for Extinction story  Madripoor  an island in South East Asia  near Singapore  Its location is shown to be in the southern portion of the Strait of Malacca  south west of Singapore  Muir Island  a remote island off the coast of Scotland  This is primarily known in the X Men universe as the home of Moira MacTaggert s laboratory  Mutant Town  also known as District X   an area in Alphabet City  Manhattan  populated largely by mutants and beset by poverty and crime  Savage Land  a preserved location in Antarctica which is home to a number of extinct species  most notably dinosaurs  Utopia  Cyclops has Asteroid M risen from the Pacific Ocean off the coast of the San Francisco as a response to the rise of anti mutant sentiment to form a new Mutant Nation   edit  Other versions Age of Apocalypse   In a world where Professor Xavier is killed before he can form the X Men  Magneto leads the X Men in a dystopian world ruled by Apocalypse  Created and reverted via time travel  Days of Future Past   Sentinels have either killed or placed into concentration camps almost all mutants  Prevented by the time traveling Kate Pryde  the adult Kitty Pryde Shadowcat   House of M   Reality is altered by Scarlet Witch  with her father Magneto as the world s ruler  2005 s crossover event  it concludes with a reversion to the normal Marvel Universe  albeit with most mutants depowered  Marvel 1602   Mutants are known as the  Witchbreed  in this alternate reality set during the time of The Inquisition  Carlos Javier creates a  school for the children of gentlefolk  to serve as a safe haven and training ground  Marvel 2099   Set in a dystopian world with new characters looking to the original X Men as history  becoming X Men 2099 and X Nation 2099  Mutant X   Set in a world where Scott Summers was captured along with his parents by the Shi ar and only Alex escaped  allowing him to be the eventual leader of this Universe s X Factor   The Six    The Mutant X universe reimagines Mr  Fantastic  Nick Fury  and Professor X as villains and Doctor Doom and Apocalypse as heroes  Ultimate X Men   Set in the reimagined Ultimate Marvel universe  X Men Forever   An alternate continuity diverging from X Men vol  2   3  continuing as though writer Chris Claremont had never left writing the series  20  X Men Noir   Set in the 1930s  with the X Men as a mysterious criminal gang and the Brotherhood as a secret society of corrupt cops  X Men  The End   A possible ending to the X Men s early 2005 status quo   edit  Reflecting social issues The conflict between mutants and normal humans is often compared to conflicts experienced by minority groups in America such as African Americans  Jews  Communists  the LGBT community  etc  21  22  Also on an individual level  a number of X Men serve a metaphorical function as their powers illustrate points about the nature of the outsider   The X Men are hated  feared and despised collectively by humanity for no other reason than that they are mutants  So what we have here  intended or not  is a book that is about racism  bigotry and prejudice   Uncanny X Men writer Chris Claremont  1981 Racism  Although this was not initially the case  Professor X has come to be compared to civil rights leader Martin Luther King  Jr  and Magneto to the more militant Malcolm X  23  24  25  The X Men s purpose is sometimes referred to as achieving  Xavier s dream   perhaps a reference to King s historic  I Have a Dream  speech  26  Magneto  in the first film  quotes Malcolm X with the line  By any means necessary   X Men comic books have often portrayed mutants as victims of mob violence  evoking images of the lynching of African Americans in the age before the American civil rights movement  27 Sentinels and anti mutant hate groups such as Friends of Humanity  Humanity s Last Stand  the Church of Humanity and Stryker s Purifiers are thought to often represent oppressive forces like the Ku Klux Klan giving a form to denial of civil rights and amendments  28  In the 1980s  the comic featured a plot involving the fictional island nation of Genosha  where mutants were segregated and enslaved by an apartheid state  This is widely interpreted as having been a reference to the situation in South Africa at the time  29  Anti Semitism  Explicitly referenced in recent decades is the comparison between anti mutant sentiment and anti Semitism  Magneto  a Holocaust survivor  sees the situation of mutants as similar to those of Jews in Nazi Germany  24  30  At one point he even utters the words  never again  in a 1992 episode of the X Men animated series  The mutant slave labor camps on the island of Genosha  in which numbers were burned into mutant s foreheads  show much in common with Nazi concentration camps  30  31  32  as do the internment camps of the classic  Days of Future Past  storyline  33  Another notable reference is in the third X Men film  when asked by Callisto   If you re so proud of being a mutant  then where s your mark   Magneto shows his concentration camp tattoo  while mentioning that he will never let another needle touch his skin  Diversity  Characters within the X Men mythos hail from a wide variety of nationalities  These characters also reflect religious  ethnic or sexual minorities  Examples include Shadowcat  Sabra and Magneto who are Jewish  Dust who is a devout Muslim  Nightcrawler who is a devout Catholic  and Neal Shaara Thunderbird who is Hindu  Storm  Ororo Munroe  represents two aspects of the African diaspora as her father was African American and her mother was Kenyan  Karma was portrayed as a devout Catholic from Vietnam  who regularly attended Mass and confession when she was introduced as a founding member of the New Mutants  This team also included Wolfsbane  a devout Scots Presbyterian   Danielle Moonstar  a Cheyenne Native American  and Cannonball  and was later joined by Magma  a devout Greco Roman classical religionist   Different nationalities included Wolverine  Aurora and Northstar as Canadians  Colossus from Russia  Banshee from Ireland  Gambit who is a Cajun  the original Thunderbird who was an Apache Native American  Psylocke and Chamber from the U K   Armor and Surge from Japan  Nightcrawler from Germany  Legion from Israel  Omega Sentinel  Neal Shaara  Kavita Rao and Indra from India  etc  28  34  35  LGBT themes  Another metaphor that has been applied by some to the X Men is that of LGBT  Some commentators have noted the similarities between the struggles of mutants and the LGBT community  noting the onset of special powers around puberty and the parallels between being closeted and the mutants  concealment of their powers  36  In the comics series  gay and bisexual characters include Anole  Bling   Destiny  Karma  Mystique  Courier  Northstar  Graymalkin  Rictor  Shatterstar and the Ultimate version of Colossus  Transgender issues also come up with shapechangers like Mystique  Copycat  and Courier who can change gender at will  It has been said that the comic books and the X Men animated series delved into the AIDS epidemic with a long running plot line about the Legacy Virus  a seemingly incurable disease thought at first to attack only mutants  similar to the AIDS virus which at first was spread through the gay community   37  Red Scare  Occasionally  undercurrents of the  Red Scare  are present  Senator Robert Kelly s proposal of a Mutant Registration Act is similar to the efforts of United States Congress to try to ban Communism in the United States  32  In the 2000 X Men film  Kelly exclaims   We must know who these mutants are and what they can do   even brandishing a  list  of known mutants  a reference to Senator Joseph McCarthy s list of Communist Party USA members who were working in the government   38  Religion  Religion is an integral part of several X Men storylines  It is presented as both a positive and negative force  sometimes in the same story  The comics explore religious fundamentalism through the person of William Stryker and his Purifiers  an anti mutant group that emerged in the 1982 graphic novel God Loves  Man Kills  The Purifiers believe that mutants are not human beings but children of the devil  and have attempted to exterminate them several times  most recently in the  Childhood s End  storyline  By contrast  religion is also central to the lives of several X Men  such as Nightcrawler  a devout Catholic  and Dust  a devout Sunni Muslim who observes Islamic Hijab  34  Subculture  In some cases  the mutants of the X Men universe sought to create a subculture of the typical mutant society portrayed  The X Men comics first introduced a band of mutants called the Morlocks  This group  though mutants like those attending Xavier s school  sought to hide away from society within the tunnels of New York  These Morlock tunnels served as the backdrop for several X Men stories  most notably The Mutant Massacre crossover  This band of mutants illustrates another dimension to the comic  that of a group that further needs to isolate itself because society won t accept it  39  40  In Grant Morrison s stories of the early 2000s  mutants are portrayed as a distinct subculture with  mutant bands   mutant use of code names as their primary form of self identity  rather than their given birth names   and a popular mutant fashion designer who created outfits tailored to mutant physiology  The series District X takes place in an area of New York City called  Mutant Town   29  These instances can also serve as analogies for the way that minority groups establish subcultures and neighborhoods of their own that distinguish them from the broader general culture  Director Bryan Singer has remarked that the X Men franchise has served as a metaphor for acceptance of all people for their special and unique gifts  The mutant condition that is often kept secret from the world can be analogous to feelings of difference and fear usually developed in everyone during adolescence   edit  Cultural impact The insecurity and anxieties in Marvel s early 1960s comic books such as The Fantastic Four  The Amazing Spider Man  The Incredible Hulk  and X Men ushered in a new type of superhero  very different from the certain and all powerful superheroes before them  and changed the public s perception of them  41   edit  In other media Main article  X Men in other media  edit  References This section includes a list of references  but its sources remain
