 Biography  edit  Early years Michael Chabon  pronounced  in his words   Shea as in Shea Stadium  Bon as in Bon Jovi   i e      e b n   was born in Washington  DC to Robert Chabon  a physician and lawyer  and Sharon Chabon  a lawyer  Chabon said he knew he wanted to be a writer when  at the age of ten  he wrote his first short story for a class assignment  When the story received an A  Chabon recalls   I thought to myself   That s it  That s what I want to do  I can do this   And I never had any second thoughts or doubts   11  Referring to popular culture  he wrote of being raised  on a hearty diet of crap   12  His parents divorced when Chabon was 11  and he grew up in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  and Columbia  Maryland  Columbia  where Chabon lived nine months of the year with his mother  was  a progressive planned living community in which racial  economic  and religious diversity were actively fostered   8  He has written of his mother s marijuana use  recalling her  sometime around 1977 or so  sitting in the front seat of her friend Kathy s car  passing a little metal pipe back and forth before we went in to see a movie   13  Chabon attended Carnegie Mellon University for a year before transferring to the University of Pittsburgh  where he studied under Chuck Kinder and received a Bachelor of Arts in 1984  8  He then went to graduate school at the University of California  Irvine  where he received a Master of Fine Arts in creative writing   edit  The Mysteries of Pittsburgh and initial literary success Chabon s first novel  The Mysteries of Pittsburgh  was written as his UC Irvine master s thesis  Without telling Chabon  his professor  Donald Heiney  better known by his pen name  MacDonald Harris   sent it to a literary agent  14  who got the author an impressive  155 000 advance on the novel  most first time novelists receive advances ranging from  5 000 to  7 500   15 The Mysteries of Pittsburgh appeared in 1988 and became a bestseller  instantly catapulting Chabon to the status of literary celebrity  Among Chabon s major literary influences in this period were Donald Barthelme  Jorge Luis Borges  Gabriel Garc a M rquez  Raymond Chandler  John Updike  Philip Roth and F  Scott Fitzgerald  16  As Chabon remarked in 2010   I just copied the writers whose voices I was responding to  and I think that s probably the best way to learn   16  Chabon was ambivalent about his newfound fame  He turned down offers to appear in a Gap ad and to be featured as one of People s  50 Most Beautiful People   17   He later said  of the People offer   I don t give a shit  about it      I only take pride in things I ve actually done myself  To be praised for something like that is just weird  It just felt like somebody calling and saying   We want to put you in a magazine because the weather s so nice where you live     10  In 2001  Chabon reflected on the success of his first novel by saying that while  the upside was that I was published and I got a readership   the  downside     was that  emotionally  this stuff started happening and I was still like   Wait a minute  is my thesis done yet   It took me a few years to catch up   10  In 1991  Chabon published A Model World  a collection of short stories  many of which had been published previously in The New Yorker   edit  Fountain City and Wonder Boys After the success of The Mysteries of Pittsburgh  Chabon spent five years working on a second novel  Called Fountain City  the novel was a  highly ambitious opus     about an architect building a perfect baseball park in Florida   18  and it eventually ballooned to 1 500 pages  with no end in sight  11  The process was frustrating for Chabon  who  in his words   never felt like I was conceptually on steady ground   18  At one point  Chabon submitted a 672 page draft to his agent and editor  who disliked the work  Chabon had problems dropping the novel  though   It was really scary   he said later   I d already signed a contract and been paid all this money  And then I d gotten a divorce and half the money was already with my ex wife  My instincts were telling me  This book is fucked  Just drop it  But I didn t  because I thought  What if I have to give the money back   19   I used to go down to my office and fantasize about all the books I could write instead   When he finally decided to abandon Fountain City  Chabon recalls staring at his blank computer for hours  before suddenly picturing  a  straitlaced  troubled young man with a tendency toward melodrama  trying to end it all   11  He began writing  and within a couple of days  had written 50 pages of what would become his second novel  Wonder Boys  Chabon drew on his experiences with Fountain City for the character of Grady Tripp  a frustrated novelist who has spent years working on an immense fourth novel  The author wrote Wonder Boys in a dizzy seven month streak  without telling his agent or publisher he d abandoned Fountain City  The book  published in 1995  was a commercial and critical success  In late 2010   An annotated  four chapter fragment  20  from the unfinished 1 500 page manuscript Fountain City  complete with cautionary introduction and postscript  20  written by Chabon was included in McSweeney s 36  20   edit  The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier  amp  Clay Main article  The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier  amp  Clay Among the supporters of Wonder Boys was The Washington Post critic Jonathan Yardley  however  despite declaring Chabon  the young star of American letters   Yardley argued that  in his works to that point  Chabon had been preoccupied  with fictional explorations of his own     It is time for him to move on  to break away from the first person and explore larger worlds   21  Chabon later said that he took Yardley s criticism to heart  explaining   It chimed with my own thoughts  I had bigger ambitions   22  In 1999 he published his second collection of short stories  Werewolves in their Youth  which included his first published foray into genre fiction  3  the grim horror story  In the Black Mill   Shortly after completing Wonder Boys  Chabon discovered a box of comic books from his childhood  a reawakened interest in comics  coupled with memories of the  lore  his Brooklyn born father had told him about  the middle years of the twentieth century in America    the radio shows  politicians  movies  music  and athletes  and so forth  of that era   inspired him to begin work on a new novel  23  In 2000  he published The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier  amp  Clay  an epic historical novel that charts 16 years in the lives of Sammy Clay and Joe Kavalier  two Jewish cousins who create a wildly popular series of comic books in the early 1940s  the years leading up to the entry of the U S  into World War II  The novel received  nearly unanimous praise  and became a New York Times Best Seller  8  eventually winning the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction  Chabon reflected that  in writing Kavalier  amp  Clay   I discovered strengths I had hoped that I possessed   the ability to pull off multiple points of view  historical settings  the passage of years   but which had never been tested before   24   edit  Summerland  The Final Solution  Gentlemen of the Road  and The Yiddish Policemen s Union In 2002  Chabon published Summerland  a fantasy novel written for younger readers that received mixed reviews but sold extremely well  25  and won the 2003 Mythopoeic Fantasy Award  Two years later  he published The Final Solution  a novella about an investigation led by an unknown old man  whom the reader can guess to be Sherlock Holmes  during the final years of World War II  His Dark Horse Comics project The Amazing Adventures of the Escapist  a quarterly anthology series that was published from 2004 to 2006  purported to cull stories from an involved  fictitious 60 year history of the Escapist character created by the protagonists of The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier  amp  Clay  It was awarded the 2005 Eisner Award for Best Anthology and a pair of Harvey Awards for Best Anthology and Best New Series  In late 2006  Chabon completed work on Gentlemen of the Road  a 15 part serialized novel that ran in The New York Times Magazine from January 28 to May 6  2007  The serial  which at one point had the working title  Jews with Swords   was described by Chabon as  a swashbuckling adventure story set around the year 1000   26  Just before Gentlemen of the Road completed its run  the author published his latest novel  The Yiddish Policemen s Union  which he had worked on since February 2002  A hard boiled detective story that imagines an alternate history in which Israel collapsed in 1948 and European Jews settled in Alaska  the novel was launched on May 1  2007 to enthusiastic reviews  27  and spent six weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list  28  The novel also won the 2008 Hugo Award   edit  Manhood for Amateurs and Telegraph Avenue In May 2007  Chabon said that he was working on a young adult novel with  some fantastic content   29  A month later  the author said he had put plans for the young adult book on hold  30  and instead had signed a two book deal with HarperCollins  The first a book length work of non fiction called Manhood for Amateurs  The Pleasures and Regrets of a Husband  Father  and Son published in spring 2009  2010 in Europe   the work discusses  being a man in all its complexity   a son  a father  a husband   31  The collection was nominated for a 2010 Northern California Book Award in the Creative Nonfiction category  32  This was Chabon s second published collection of essays and non fiction  McSweeney s published Maps and Legends  a collection of Chabon s literary essays  on May 1  2008  33  Proceeds from the book benefited 826 National  34  Also in 2008  Chabon received the Peggy V  Helmerich Distinguished Author Award  presented annually by the Tulsa  Oklahoma  Library Trust  Chabon s second book under the contract  with a tentative publication date of 2011  will be a contemporary adult novel set in and around the San Francisco Bay Area  During a 2007 interview with the Washington Post  Chabon was quoted as saying   I would like it to be set in the present day and feel right now the urge to do something more mainstream than my recent work has been   During a Q amp A session in January 2009  Chabon added that he was writing a  naturalistic  novel about two families in Berkeley  35  In a March 2010 interview with the Guardian newspaper  Chabon confirmed that the novel in progress was still very much naturalistic and that  So far there s no overtly genre content  it s set in the present day and has no alternate reality or anything like that   16  In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on December 7  2010  Chabon said that he hopes to submit the novel in 2011 and that its provisional title is Telegraph Avenue  36  Despite his success  Chabon continues to perceive himself as a  failure   noting that  anyone who has ever received a bad review knows how it outlasts  by decades  the memory of a favorable word   37  In June 2010 he wrote an editorial for the New York Times in which he noted the role of exceptionalism in Jewish identity  in relation to the  blockheadedness  of Israel s botched Gaza flotilla raid and the explanations that followed  38   edit  Personal life In 1987  Chabon married the poet Lollie Groth  After the publication of The Mysteries of Pittsburgh  he was mistakenly featured in a Newsweek article on up and coming gay writers  Pittsburgh s protagonist has liaisons with people of both sexes   The New York Times later reported that  in some ways   Chabon  was happy  for the magazine s error  and quoted him as saying   I feel very lucky about all of that  It really opened up a new readership to me  and a very loyal one   17  In a 2002 interview  Chabon added   if Mysteries of Pittsburgh is about anything in terms of human sexuality and identity  it s that people can t be put into categories all that easily   39  In  On The Mysteries of Pittsburgh   an essay he wrote for the New York Review of Books in 2005  Chabon remarked on the autobiographical events that helped inspire his first novel   I had slept with one man whom I loved  and learned to love another man so much that it would never have occurred to me to want to sleep with him   40  According to Chabon  the popularity of The Mysteries of Pittsburgh had adverse effects  he later explained   I was married at the time to someone else who was also a struggling writer  and the success created a gross imbalance in our careers  which was problematic   10  He and Groth divorced in 1991  and he married the writer Ayelet Waldman in 1993  They currently live together in Berkeley  California with their four children  41  Sophie  b  1994   Ezekiel  Zeke  Napoleon Waldman  b  1997   Ida Rose  b  June 1  2001   and Abraham Wolf Waldman  b  March 31  2003   Chabon has said that the  creative freeflow  he has with Waldman inspired the relationship between Sammy Clay and Rosa Saks toward the end of The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier  amp  Clay  23  and in 2007  Entertainment Weekly declared the couple  a famous   and famously in love   writing pair  like Nick and Nora Charles with word processors and not so much booze   29  In 2000  Chabon told The New York Times that he kept a strict schedule  writing from 10 a m  to 3 p m  each day  Sunday through Thursday  17  He tries to write 1 000 words a day  Commenting on the rigidity of his routine  Chabon said   There have been plenty of self destructive rebel angel novelists over the years  but writing is about getting your work done and getting your work done every day  If you want to write novels  they take a long time  and they re big  and they have a lot of words in them     The best environment  at least for me  is a very stable  structured kind of life   10   edit  Interest in genre fiction In a 2002 essay  Chabon decried the state of modern short fiction  including his own   saying that  with rare exceptions  it consisted solely of  the contemporary  quotidian  plotless  moment of truth revelatory story   42  In an apparent reaction against these  plotless  stories  sparkling with epiphanic dew   Chabon s post 2000 work has been marked by an increased interest in genre fiction and plot  While The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay was  like The Mysteries of Pittsburgh and Wonder Boys  an essentially realistic  contemporary novel  whose plot happened to revolve around comic book superheroes   Chabon s subsequent works such as The Final Solution  his dabbling with comic book writing  and the  swashbuckling adventure  of Gentlemen of the Road have been almost exclusively devoted to mixing aspects of genre and literary fiction  Perhaps the most notable example of this is The Yiddish Policemen s Union  which won five genre awards  including the Hugo award and Nebula award  14  Chabon seeks to  annihilate  not the genres themselves  but the bias against certain genres of fiction such as fantasy  science fiction and romance  14  Chabon s forays into genre fiction have met with mixed critical reaction  One science fiction short story by Chabon   The Martian Agent   was described by a reviewer as  enough to send readers back into the cold but reliable arms of The New Yorker   43  Another critic wrote of the same story that it was  richly plotted  action packed   and that  Chabon skilfully elaborates his world and draws not just on the steampunk worlds of William Gibson  Bruce Sterling and Michael Moorcock  but on alternate histories by brilliant SF mavericks such as Avram Davidson and Howard Waldrop  The imperial politics are craftily resonant and the story keeps us hanging on   44  While The Village Voice called The Final Solution  an ingenious  fully imagined work  an expert piece of literary ventriloquism  and a mash note to the beloved boys  tales of Chabon s youth   45 The Boston Globe wrote    T he genre of the comic book is an anemic vein for novelists to mine  lest they squander their brilliance   46  and The New York Times added that the detective story   a genre that is by its nature so constrained  so untransgressive  seems unlikely to appeal to the real writer   43  In 2005  Chabon argued against the idea that genre fiction and entertaining fiction should not appeal to  the real writer   saying that the common perception is that  Entertainment       means junk         But  maybe the reason for the junkiness of so much of what pretends to entertain us is that we have accepted indeed  we have helped to articulate such a narrow  debased concept of entertainment        I d like to believe that  because I read for entertainment  and I write to entertain  Period   47  One of the more positive responses to Chabon s brand of  trickster literature  appeared in Time magazine  whose Lev Grossman wrote that  This is literature in mid transformation         T he highbrow and the lowbrow  once kept chastely separate  are now hooking up   and  you can almost see the future of literature coming   48  Grossman classed Chabon with a movement of authors similarly eager to blend literary and popular writing  including Jonathan Lethem  with whom Chabon is friends   3 Margaret Atwood  and Susanna Clarke  On the other hand  in Slate in 2007  Ruth Franklin said   Michael Chabon has spent considerable energy trying to drag the decaying corpse of genre fiction out of the shallow grave where writers of serious literature abandoned it   49   edit  The Van Zorn persona For some of his own genre work  Chabon has forged an unusual horror fantasy fiction persona under the name of August Van Zorn  More elaborately developed than a pseudonym  August Van Zorn is purported to be a pen name for one Albert Vetch  1899 1963   50  In Chabon s 1995 novel Wonder Boys  narrator Grady Tripp writes that he grew up in the same hotel as Vetch  who worked as an English professor at the  nonexistent  Coxley College and wrote hundreds of pulp stories that were  in the gothic mode  after the manner of Lovecraft     but written in a dry  ironic  at times almost whimsical idiom   50  A horror themed short story titled  In the Black Mill  was published in Playboy in June 1997 and reprinted in Chabon s 1999 story collection Werewolves in Their Youth  and was attributed to Van Zorn  51  Chabon has created a comprehensive bibliography 52  for Van Zorn  along with an equally fictional literary scholar devoted to his oeuvre named Leon Chaim Bach  53  Bach s now defunct website 54   which existed under the auspices of Chabon s  declared Van Zorn to be   without question  the greatest unknown horror writer of the twentieth century   and mentioned that Bach had once edited a collection of short stories by Van Zorn titled The Abominations of Plunkettsburg  55   The name  Leon Chaim Bach  is an anagram of  Michael Chabon   as is  Malachi B  Cohen   the name of a fictional comics expert who wrote occasional essays about the Escapist for the character s Dark Horse Comic series   In 2004  Chabon established the August Van Zorn Prize   awarded to the short story that most faithfully and disturbingly embodies the tradition of the weird short story as practiced by Edgar Allan Poe and his literary descendants  among them August Van Zorn   3  The first recipient of the prize was Jason Roberts  whose winning story   7C   was then included in McSweeney s Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories  edited by Chabon  53  A scene in the film adaptation of Chabon s novel The Mysteries of Pittsburgh shows two characters in a bookstore stocking August Van Zorn books   edit  The Chabon universe Chabon has provided several subtle hints throughout his work that the stories he tells take place in a shared fictional universe  One recurring character  who is mentioned in three of Chabon s books but never actually appears  is Eli Drinkwater  a fictional catcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates who died abruptly after crashing his car on Mt  Nebo Road  56  The most detailed exposition of Drinkwater s life appears in Chabon s 1990 short story  Smoke   which is set at Drinkwater s funeral  and refers to him as  a scholarly catcher  a redoubtable batsman  and a kind  affectionate person   56  Drinkwater was again referred to  though not by name  in Chabon s 1995 novel Wonder Boys  in which narrator Grady Tripp explains that his sportswriter friend Happy Blackmore was hired  to ghost the autobiography of a catcher  a rising star who played for Pittsburgh and hit the sort of home runs that linger in the memory for years   57  Tripp explains that Blackmore turned in an inadequate draft  his book contract was cancelled  and the catcher died shortly afterwards   leaving nothing in Happy s notorious  files  but the fragments and scribblings of a ghost   57  In Chabon s children s book Summerland  2002   it is suggested that Blackmore was eventually able to find a publisher for the biography  the character Jennifer T  mentions that she has read a book called Eli Drinkwater  A Life in Baseball  written by Happy Blackmore  58  Drinkwater s name may have been selected in homage to contemporary author John Crowley  whom Chabon is on the record as admiring  Crowley s novel Little  Big featured a main character named Alice Drinkwater  There are also instances in which character surnames reappear from story to story  Cleveland Arning  a character in Chabon s 1988 debut novel  The Mysteries of Pittsburgh  is described as having come from a wealthy family  59  one that might be expected to be able to endow a building  Near the end of Wonder Boys  1995   it is mentioned that  on the unnamed college campus at which Grady Tripp teaches  there is a building called Arning Hall  where the English faculty kept office hours   60  Similarly  in Chabon s 1989 short story  A Model World   a character named Levine discovers  or rather plagiarizes  a formula for  nephokinesis   or cloud control  that wins him respect and prominence in the meteorological field  61  In The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier  amp  Clay  2000   a passing reference is made to the  massive Levine School of Applied Meteorology   ostensibly a building owned by New York University  62   edit  Experiences with Hollywood Although Michael Chabon has described his attitude toward Hollywood as  pre emptive cynicism   15  for years the author has nevertheless engaged in sustained  and often fruitless  efforts to bring both adapted and original projects to the screen  In 1994  Chabon pitched a screenplay entitled The Gentleman Host to producer Scott Rudin  a romantic comedy  about old Jewish folks on a third rate cruise ship out of Miami   19  Rudin bought the project and developed it with Chabon  but it was never filmed  partly due to the release of the similarly themed film Out to Sea in 1997  In the nineties  Chabon also pitched story ideas for both the X Men 63  and the Fantastic Four 64  movies  but was rejected  When Scott Rudin was adapting Wonder Boys for the screen  the author declined an offer to write the screenplay  saying he was too busy writing The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay  15  Directed by Curtis Hanson and starring Michael Douglas  Wonder Boys was released in 2000 to critical acclaim and financial failure  65  Having bought the film rights to The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay  Rudin then asked Chabon to work on that film s screenplay  Although Chabon spent 16 months in 2001 and 2002 working on the novel s film adaptation  the project has been mired in pre production for years  Chabon s work  however  remains popular in Hollywood  with Rudin purchasing the film rights to The Yiddish Policemen s Union in 2002  five years before the book would be published  The same year  Miramax bought the rights to Summerland and Tales of Mystery and Imagination  a planned collection of eight genre short stories that Chabon has not yet written   each of which was optioned for a sum in the mid six figures  66  Chabon also wrote a draft for 2004 s Spider Man 2  about a third of which was used in the final film  Soon after Spider Man 2 was released  director Sam Raimi mentioned that he hoped to hire Chabon to work on the film s sequel   if I can get him   67  but Chabon never worked on Spider Man 3  In October 2004  it was announced that Chabon was at work writing Disney s Snow and the Seven  a live action martial arts retelling of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to be directed by master Hong Kong fight choreographer and director Yuen Wo Ping  68  In August 2006  Chabon said that he had been replaced on Snow  sarcastically explaining that the producers wanted to go in  more of a fun direction   69  Although Chabon is uninvolved with the project  director Rawson Marshall Thurber shot a film adaptation of The Mysteries of Pittsburgh in fall 2006  70  The film  which stars Sienna Miller and Peter Sarsgaard  was released in April 2008  In February 2008  Scott Rudin reported that a film adaptation of The Yiddish Policemen s Union was in pre production  to be written and directed by the Coen brothers  71  72  In April 2009  Chabon confirmed he had been hired to do revisions to the script for Disney s John Carter  73   edit  Works  edit  Novels The Mysteries of Pittsburgh  1988  Wonder Boys  1995  The
