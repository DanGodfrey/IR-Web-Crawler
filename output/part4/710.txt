Oscar  disambiguation   Academy Award 84th Academy Awards An Academy Award statuette Awarded for Excellence in cinematic achievements Presented by Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Country United States First awarded May 16  1929 Official website www oscars org An Academy Award is an award bestowed by the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences  AMPAS  1  to recognize excellence of professionals in the film industry  including directors  actors  and writers  The Oscar statuette is officially named the Academy Award of Merit and is one of nine types of Academy Awards  The formal ceremony at which the Awards of Merit are presented is one of the most prominent award ceremonies in the world  and is televised live in more than 100 countries annually  It is also the oldest award ceremony in the media  its equivalents  the Grammy Awards  for music   Emmy Awards  for television   and Tony Awards  for theatre  are modeled after the Academy  The AMPAS was originally conceived by Metro Goldwyn Mayer studio boss Louis B  Mayer as a professional honorary organization to help improve the film industry s image and help mediate labor disputes  The Oscar itself was later initiated by the Academy as an award  of merit for distinctive achievement  in the industry  2  The first Academy Awards ceremony was held on May 16  1929  at the Hotel Roosevelt in Hollywood to honor the outstanding film achievements of the 1927 1928 film season  The 84th Academy Awards  honoring films in 2011  was held at the Hollywood and Highland Center on February 26  2012

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel with an audience of about 270 people  The post Academy Awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel  3  The cost of guest tickets for that night s ceremony was  5  Fifteen statuettes were awarded  honoring artists  directors and other personalities of the filmmaking industry of the time for their works during the 1927 1928 period  Winners had been announced three months earlier   however that was changed in the second ceremony of the Academy Awards in 1930  Since then and during the first decade  the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11 pm on the night of the awards  3  This method was used until the Los Angeles Times announced the winners before the ceremony began  as a result  the Academy has used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners since 1941  3  For the first six ceremonies  the eligibility period spanned two calendar years  For example  the 2nd Academy Awards presented on April 3  1930  recognized films that were released between August 1  1928 and July 31  1929  Starting with the 7th Academy Awards  held in 1935  the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31  The first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jannings  for his performances in The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh  He had to return to Europe before the ceremony  so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier  this made him the first Academy Award winner in history  The honored professionals were awarded for all the work done in a certain category for the qualifying period  for example  Emil Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period  Since the fourth ceremony  the system changed  and the professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film  As of the 83rd Academy Awards ceremony held in 2011 update   a total of 2 809 Oscars have been given for 1 853 awards  4  A total of 302 actors have won Oscars in competitive acting categories or been awarded Honorary or Juvenile Awards  The 1939 film Beau Geste is the only movie that features as many as four Academy Award winners for Best Actor in a Leading Role  Gary Cooper  Ray Milland  Susan Hayward  Broderick Crawford  prior to any of the actors receiving the Best Actor Award  At the 29th ceremony  held on March 27  1957  the Best Foreign Language Film category was introduced  Until then  foreign language films were honored with the Special Achievement Award   edit  Oscar statuette  edit  Design Although there are seven other types of annual awards presented by the Academy  the Irving G  Thalberg Memorial Award  the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award  the Gordon E  Sawyer Award  the Scientific and Engineering Award  the Technical Achievement Award  the John A  Bonner Medal of Commendation  and the Student Academy Award  plus two awards that are not presented annually  the Special Achievement Award in the form of an Oscar statuette and the Honorary Award that may or may not be in the form of an Oscar statuette   the best known one is the Academy Award of Merit more popularly known as the Oscar statuette  Made of gold plated britannium on a black metal base  it is 13 5 in  34 cm  tall  weighs 8 5 lb  3 85 kg  and depicts a knight rendered in Art Deco style holding a crusader s sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes  The five spokes each represent the original branches of the Academy  Actors  Writers  Directors  Producers  and Technicians  5  In 1928  MGM s art director Cedric Gibbons  one of the original Academy members  supervised the design of the award trophy by printing the design on a scroll  6  In need of a model for his statuette  Gibbons was introduced by his future wife Dolores del R o to Mexican film director and actor Emilio  El Indio  Fern ndez  Reluctant at first  Fern ndez was finally convinced to pose nude to create what today is known as the  Oscar   Then  sculptor George Stanley  who also did the Muse Fountain 7  at the Hollywood Bowl  sculpted Gibbons s design in clay and Sachin Smith cast the statuette in 92 5 percent tin and 7 5 percent copper and then gold plated it  The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base  The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the C W  Shumway  amp  Sons Foundry in Batavia  Illinois  which also contributed to casting the molds for the Vince Lombardi Trophy and Emmy Awards statuettes  Since 1983  8  approximately 50 Oscars are made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer R S  Owens  amp  Company  9  In support of the American effort in World War II  the statuettes were made of plaster and were traded in for gold ones after the war had ended  10   edit  Naming The root of the name Oscar is contested  One biography of Bette Davis claims that she named the Oscar after her first husband  band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson  11  one of the earliest mentions in print of the term Oscar dates back to a Time magazine article about the 1934 6th Academy Awards  12 Walt Disney is also quoted as thanking the Academy for his Oscar as early as 1932  13  Another claimed origin is that the Academy s Executive Secretary  Margaret Herrick  first saw the award in 1931 and made reference to the statuette s reminding her of her  Uncle Oscar   a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce   14  Columnist Sidney Skolsky was present during Herrick s naming and seized the name in his byline   Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette  Oscar    15  The trophy was officially dubbed the  Oscar  in 1939 by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences  16  Another legend reports that the Norwegian American Eleanor Lilleberg  executive secretary to Louis B  Mayer  saw the first statuette and exclaimed   It looks like King Oscar II    17  At the end of the day she asked   What should we do with Oscar  put him in the vault   and the name stuck   edit  Ownership of Oscar statuettes Since 1950  the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the Academy for US 1  If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation  then the Academy keeps the statuette  Academy Awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six figure sums  18  In December 2011  Orson Welles  1941 Oscar for Citizen Kane was put up for auction  after his heirs won a 2004 court decision that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy  19  While the Oscar is under the ownership of the recipient  it is essentially not on the open market  20  The case of Michael Todd s grandson trying to sell Todd s Oscar statuette illustrates that there are some who do not agree with this idea  When Todd s grandson attempted to sell Todd s Oscar statuette to a movie prop collector  the Academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction  Although Oscar sales transactions have been successful  some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy  which keeps them in its treasury  21   edit  Nomination Since 2004  Academy Award nomination results have been announced to the public in late January  Prior to that  the results were announced in early February   edit  Voters The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences  AMPAS   a professional honorary organization  maintains a voting membership of 5 783 as of 2012 update   22  Academy membership is divided into different branches  with each representing a different discipline in film production  Actors constitute the largest voting bloc  numbering 1 311 members  22 percent  of the Academy s composition  Votes have been certified by the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers  and its predecessor Price Waterhouse  for the past 73 annual awards ceremonies  23  All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors  on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees  Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contribution to the field of motion pictures  New membership proposals are considered annually  The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership  although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join  The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6 000 voting members  While the membership had been growing  stricter policies have kept its size steady since then  24  In May 2011  the Academy sent a letter advising its 6 000 or so voting members that an online system for Oscar voting will be implemented in 2013  25   edit  Rules Currently  according to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules  a film must open in the previous calendar year  from midnight at the start of January 1 to midnight at the end of December 31  in Los Angeles County  California  to qualify  except for the Best Foreign Language Film   26  For example  the 2010 Best Picture winner  The Hurt Locker  was actually first released in 2008  but did not qualify for the 2009 awards as it did not play its Oscar qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid 2009  thus qualifying for the 2010 awards  Rule 2 states that a film must be feature length  defined as a minimum of 40 minutes  except for short subject awards  and it must exist either on a 35 mm or 70 mm film print or in 24 frame s or 48 frame s progressive scan digital cinema format with native resolution not less than 1280x720  Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline  in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline  the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year  The form includes the production credits for all related categories  Then  each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible Releases  In late December ballots and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around 6000 active members  For most categories  members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories  i e  only directors vote for directors  writers for writers  actors for actors  etc    There are some exceptions in the case of certain categories  like Foreign Film  Documentary and Animated Feature Film  in which movies are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches  In the special case of Best Picture  all voting members are eligible to select the nominees for that category  Foreign films must include English subtitles  and each country can submit only one film per year  27  The members of the various branches nominate those in their respective fields  while all members may submit nominees for Best Picture  The winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are then allowed to vote in most categories  including Best Picture  28   edit  Ceremony  edit  Telecast 31st Academy Awards Presentations  Pantages Theater  Hollywood  1959 81st Academy Awards Presentations  Kodak Theater  Hollywood  2009 The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony  most commonly in February or March following the relevant calendar year  and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees  It is the culmination of the film awards season  which usually begins during November or December of the previous year  This is an elaborate extravaganza  with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day  Black tie dress is the most common outfit for men  although fashion may dictate not wearing a bow tie  and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this   The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony  and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast   The Academy Awards is televised live across the United States  excluding Hawaii  they aired live for the first time in Alaska in 2011   Canada  the United Kingdom  and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world  29  The 2007 ceremony was watched by more than 40 million Americans  30  Other awards ceremonies  such as the Emmys  Golden Globes  and Grammys  are broadcast live in the East Coast but are on tape delay in the West Coast and might not air on the same day outside North America  if the awards are even televised   The Academy has for several years claimed that the award show has up to a billion viewers internationally  but this has so far not been confirmed by any independent sources  The Awards show was first televised on NBC in 1953  NBC continued to broadcast the event until 1960 when the ABC Network took over  televising the festivities through 1970  after which NBC resumed the broadcasts  ABC once again took over broadcast duties in 1976  it is under contract to do so through the year 2020  31  After more than sixty years of being held in late March or early April  the ceremonies were moved up to late February or early March starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with Oscar season in the film industry  Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success of the NCAA Men s Division I Basketball Championship  which would cut into the Academy Awards audience  The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC  as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February sweeps period   Some years  the ceremony is moved into early March in deference to the Winter Olympics   Advertising is somewhat restricted  however  as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast  The Awards show holds the distinction of having won the most Emmys in history  with 47 wins and 195 nominations  32  After many years of being held on Mondays at 9 00 p m  Eastern 6 00 p m Pacific  in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to Sundays at 8 30 p m  Eastern 5 30 p m  Pacific  33  The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays  that Los Angeles rush hour traffic jams could be avoided  and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier  34  For many years the film industry had opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office  35  On March 30  1981  the awards ceremony was postponed for one day after the shooting of President Ronald Reagan and others in Washington  D C  In 1993  an In Memoriam segment was introduced  36  honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months  a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members  37  This segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names  In 2010  the organizers of the Academy Awards announced that winners  acceptance speeches must not run past 45 seconds  This  according to organizer Bill Mechanic  was to ensure the elimination of what he termed  the single most hated thing on the show    overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion  38  The Academy has also had recent discussions about moving the ceremony even further back into January  citing TV viewers  fatigue with the film industry s long awards season  But such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members  to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers  as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail   Also  a January ceremony may have to compete with National Football League playoff games  39   edit  Awards ceremonies The following is a listing of all Academy Awards ceremonies since 1929  40  41

of viewers Rating Host s  Venue Historically  the  Oscarcast  has pulled in a bigger haul when box office hits are favored to win the Best Picture trophy  More than 57 25 million viewers tuned to the telecast for the 70th Academy Awards in 1998  the year of Titanic  which generated close to US 600 million at the North American box office pre Oscars  45  The 76th Academy Awards ceremony in which The Lord of the Rings  The Return of the King  pre telecast box office earnings of US 368 million  received 11 Awards including Best Picture drew 43 56 million viewers  46  The most watched ceremony based on Nielsen ratings to date  however  was the 42nd Academy Awards  Best Picture Midnight Cowboy  which drew a 43 4  household rating on April 7  1970  47  By contrast  ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings  The 78th Academy Awards which awarded low budgeted  independent film Crash  with a pre Oscar gross of US 53 4 million  generated an audience of 38 64 million with a household rating of 22 91   48  In 2008  the 80th Academy Awards telecast was watched by 31 76 million viewers on average with an 18 66  household rating  the lowest rated and least watched ceremony to date  in spite of celebrating 80 years of the Academy Awards  49  The Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another low budget  independently financed film  No Country for Old Men    edit  Venues Pantages Theatre  2008 In 1929  the first Academy Awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel  From 1930 1943  the ceremony alternated between two venues  the Ambassador Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard and the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles  Grauman s Chinese Theater in Hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946  followed by the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles from 1947 to 1948  The 21st Academy Awards in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theater at what was the Academy s headquarters on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood  50  From 1950 to 1960  the awards were presented at Hollywood s Pantages Theatre  With the advent of television  the 1953 1957 awards took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York first at the NBC International Theatre  1953  and then at the NBC Century Theatre  1954 1957   after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles  The Oscars moved to the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Santa Monica  California in 1961  By 1969  the Academy decided to move the ceremonies back to Los Angeles  this time to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Los Angeles County Music Center  In 2002  the Kodak Theatre became the permanent home of the award ceremonies  However  due to Eastman Kodak s bankruptcy issues  this theatre was renamed the Hollywood and Highland Center in the days preceding the February 26  2012  awards ceremony   edit  Academy Awards of Merit  edit  Current awards Best Actor in a Leading Role  since 1928

 Another award  entitled the Academy Award for Best Original Musical  is still in the Academy rulebooks and has yet to be retired  However  due to continuous insufficient eligibility each year  it has

1995  edit  Criticisms Due to the positive exposure and prestige of the Academy Awards  studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the  Oscar season   This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing than quality  William Friedkin  an Academy Award winning film director and former producer of the ceremony  expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in 2009  describing it as  the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself   54  In addition  some winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars  The first to do so was Dudley Nichols  Best Writing in 1935 for The Informer   Nichols boycotted the 8th Academy Awards ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers  Guild  55 George C  Scott became the second person to refuse his award  Best Actor in 1970 for Patton  at the 43rd Academy Awards ceremony  Scott described it as a  meat parade   saying  I don t want any part of it   56  57  58  The third winner  Marlon Brando  refused his award  Best Actor in 1972 for The Godfather   citing the film industry s discrimination and mistreatment of Native Americans  At the 45th Academy Awards ceremony  Brando sent Sacheen Littlefeather to read a 15 page speech detailing his criticisms  55  Tim Dirks  editor of AMC s filmsite org  has written of the Academy Awards  Unfortunately  the critical worth  artistic vision  cultural influence  and innovative qualities of many films are not given the same voting weight  Especially since the 1980s  moneymaking  formula made  blockbusters with glossy production values have often been crowd pleasing titans  and Best Picture winners   but they haven t necessarily been great films with depth or critical acclaim by any measure  59  Acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for sentimental reasons  60  personal popularity  61  atonement for past mistakes  62  or presented as a  career honor  to recognize a distinguished nominee s entire body of work  63   edit  Associated events The following events are closely associated with the annual Academy Awards ceremony  Governors Awards The 25th Independent Spirit Awards  in 2010   usually held in Santa Monica the Saturday before the Oscars  marked the first time it was moved to a Friday and a change of venue to L A  Live  the newly built entertainment complex developed
