Dave Cockrum  Under the authorship of Chris Claremont and the artwork of first Dave Cockrum and then John Byrne in the late 1970s  Jean Grey undergoes a significant transformation from the X Men s weakest member 6  to its most powerful  In an attempt to save her fellow X Men by piloting their damaged shuttle back to earth  Jean is exposed to fatal levels of radiation  Dying but determined to save Scott and her friends  Jean s love pushes her to reach her full potential as a psychic and telekinetic  7  The ship lands in Jamaica Bay  with the other X Men unharmed  Jean then surfaces wearing a new green and gold costume and adopts the codename Phoenix  having gained immense powers  7  This new identity and her immense abilities eventually result in Jean becoming overwhelmed and corrupted by her god like powers  She transforms into a force of total destruction   now called Dark Phoenix she consumes a star  inadvertently killing the inhabitants of the star s solar system  and jeopardizes the entire universe  Eventually  in a regained moment of mental clarity  Jean commits suicide to ensure the universe s  and her fellow X Men s  safety  The storyline in which Jean Grey dies as Marvel Girl and is reborn as Phoenix  Uncanny X Men  vol  1   101 108  1976 1977  has been retroactively dubbed by fans  The Phoenix Saga   and the storyline of her eventual corruption and death as Dark Phoenix  Uncanny X Men  vol  1  129 138  1980  has been termed  The Dark Phoenix Saga   This storyline is one of the most well known and heavily referenced in mainstream American superhero comics  and is widely considered a classic  When the first trade paperback of  The Dark Phoenix Saga  was published in 1984  Marvel also published a 48 page special issue titled  Phoenix  The Untold Story   A reprinting of Uncanny X Men  137 was published  with new artwork and dialogue with the originally intended ending by Claremont and Byrne  Along with the alternate ending were transcripts of the roundtable discussion between Shooter  Claremont  Byrne  editors Jim Salicrup and Louise Jones  and inker Terry Austin about the creation of the new Phoenix persona  the development of the story  and what led to its eventual change  and also Claremont and Byrne s plans for Jean Grey had she survived  8  Claremont revealed that his and Byrne s motivation for Jean Grey s transformation into Phoenix was to create  the first cosmic superheroine  akin to Thor  9  The two hoped that like Thor had been integrated into The Avengers lineup  Phoenix would also become an effective and immensely powerful member of the X Men  9  However  both Salicrup and Byrne had strong feelings against how powerful Phoenix had become  feeling that she drew too much focus in the book  9  Byrne worked with Claremont to effectively remove Phoenix from the storyline  initially by removing her powers  However  Byrne s decision to have Dark Phoenix destroy an inhabited solar system in Uncanny X Men  135  coupled with the planned ending to the story arc  worried then Editor in Chief Jim Shooter  who felt that allowing Jean to live at the conclusion of the story was both morally unacceptable  given that she was now a  mass murderer   8  and also an unsatisfying ending from a storytelling point of view  8  Shooter publicly laid out his reasoning in the 1984 roundtable  I personally think  and I ve said this many times  that having a character destroy an inhabited world with billions of people wipe out a starship and then well  you know  having the powers removed and being let go on Earth  It seems to me that that s the same as capturing Hitler alive and letting him go live on Long Island  Now  I don t think the story would end there  I think a lot of people would come to his door with machine guns    9  In The Dark Phoenix Tapes  Claremont suggested that one of the creative team s questions that affected the story s conclusion was whether the Phoenix s personality and later descent into madness and evil were inherent to Jean Grey or if the Phoenix was itself an entity merely possessing her  9  The unclear relationship between Jean Grey and the Phoenix would continue to be a topic subject to different interpretations and explanations by various future writers and editors at Marvel Comics following the story s retcon in 1986  At the time of the Dark Phoenix s creation  Byrne felt that   If someone could be seen to corrupt Jean  rather than her just turning bad  this could make for an interesting story   10  Though Phoenix was written as being one and the same with Jean Grey  Byrne stated later in the  The Dark Phoenix Tapes  that he viewed Phoenix as an entity that entirely possessed Jean Grey  therefore absolving her of its crimes once it was driven out  9  Conversely  Shooter viewed Phoenix as an inherent and inseparable aspect of Jean Grey  meaning that the character was fully responsible for her actions as Phoenix  9  As a result  Shooter requested that Claremont and Byrne rewrite the last chapter of issue  137 to explicitly place in the story both a consequence and an ending commensurate with the enormity of Phoenix s actions  9  The original ending was published in the one shot Phoenix  The Untold Story in April  1984  In the original ending  Jean is overpowered  captured  and subjected to a  psychic lobotomy   permanently leaving Jean without any of her telepathic or telekinetic powers  The concept that Byrne and Claremont had in mind was that her powers ended up being permanently suppressed  but with the threat always in the shadows of Phoenix returning  In the end  Jean is allowed to return to Earth with the rest of the X Men   cured  of the power and madness of Dark Phoenix  9  Later plans stated by Claremont and Byrne also involved Magneto offering Jean the chance to restore her abilities  but with Jean proving herself in a heroic moment by choosing to remain depowered and eliminate the threat of Dark Phoenix returning to power  9  The one shot also reveals the original splash page drawn for Uncanny X Men  138  which shows Jean and Scott in a happier time  contrasted with the splash page actually published in issue  138 that shows Jean s funeral  9   edit  Return to publication  1986  The unfinished cover for X Factor  1  before Bob Layton and Jackson Guice decided on the fifth female team member   X Factor  vol  1  1  Art by Jackson Guice  After several years  Marvel decided to revive the character  but only after an editorial decree that the character be absolved of her actions during  The Dark Phoenix Saga   11  She reappears six years after  The Dark Phoenix Saga  in Avengers  263  January  1986  and is revived in Fantastic Four  286  January  1986   with the events of  The Dark Phoenix Saga  being retconned  The new version of events is that rather than being Jean Grey reborn  Phoenix was actually an entirely separate entity  While near death in Uncanny X Men  100  Jean makes contact with a cosmic entity called the  Phoenix Force   12  The Phoenix Force offers to save Jean s life and that of other X Men and takes on Jean s form  12  Jean Grey imbues the copy with her essence  causing the Phoenix Force to believe that it truly is Jean Grey  12  The Phoenix Force  now in the form of Jean Grey and calling itself  Phoenix   places the dying Jean Grey s body in a healing cocoon  which is lost during the events of Uncanny X Men 101  12  The duplicate continues on in the events from Uncanny X Men  101  all the while believing itself to actually be Jean Grey up to its  death  at the conclusion of  The Dark Phoenix Saga   12  Future issues would further explore the details of the interaction and connection between Jean and the Phoenix Force  13  14  The real Jean Grey awakens from the cocoon when her injuries are healed  though with lost access to her telepathy  and with no recollection or involvement in the events that occurred after meeting the Phoenix Force  12  Writer Kurt Busiek is credited as coming up with the plot to revive Jean Grey  11  At the time  Jim Shooter ruled that the character could not be revived unless she was absolved of her genocidal actions  11  Busiek  a fan of the original five X Men  was displeased with the character s death and formulated various storylines that would have met Shooter s rule and allowed the character to return to the X Men franchise  11  He eventually shared his storyline idea with fellow writer Roger Stern who mentioned it to Byrne  who was both writing and illustrating the Fantastic Four at the time  11  Both series writer Bob Layton and artist Jackson Guice  who were developing the series X Factor a team of former X Men had yet to settle on their fifth team member  initially considering Dazzler  15  Layton opted to fill the open spot with Jean instead  and both he and Byrne submitted the idea to Shooter  who approved it  11  Jean Grey s revival became a crossover plotline between the Avengers under Stern  Fantastic Four under Byrne  and X Factor under Layton  11  Busiek later found out that his idea had been used thanks to Layton  and he was credited in Fantastic Four  286 and paid for his contributions  11  The decision to revive Jean Grey was controversial among fans  with some appreciating the return of the character and others feeling it weakened the impact of the  Dark Phoenix Saga  s ending  11  Busiek maintains that the idea that led to Jean Grey s official return to Marvel Comics was merely a case of sharing his ideas with friends as a fan  and that he cannot be blamed by those who disliked her return because he neither formally pitched the idea to anyone nor gave it the final go ahead  11  In the comics  having been fully established as separate from the  Jean Grey  copy created and taken over by the Phoenix Force  Jean is  absolved  of involvement in the atrocities of  The Dark Phoenix  storyline  and she returns in the first issue of X Factor  1st Series  only to find that the other members of the original X Men have retired  16  Jean convinces the retired X Men to found a new team  X Factor  to respond to growing anti mutant sentiment and reuses the  Marvel Girl  codename  16  The series also reunited Jean with Cyclops  who abandons his wife  Madelyne Pryor a woman who looks uncannily like Jean and their infant son  Nathan Christopher  to run the X Factor team  16  Upon discovering that her former lover had established a family during her absence  Jean encourages Cyclops to return to his wife and child  17  18  However  finding their home abandoned  he believes Madelyne has left him and taken Nathan with her  prompting Scott to return to X Factor and continue his relationship with Jean  18  The team s adventures continue throughout the series  culminating in the line wide Inferno crossover  Madelyne resurfaces  now nearly insane and with powers awakened by a demonic pact  calling herself the Goblyn Queen  19  During the crossover  the X Men discover that Madelyne was a clone of Jean created by Mister Sinister and brought to life by the Phoenix Force after the events of  The Dark Phoenix Saga   Sinister created her with the purpose of having a child with Scott Summers  as their genetic pool carried the potential to produce powerful mutant offspring  This drives her completely insane and she plans to sacrifice her son to achieve greater power and forge her own destiny  20 Inferno reunites Jean with the X Men  who are happy to learn that she is alive  particularly Wolverine  reminding Jean of her unaddressed feelings for him  At the conclusion of Inferno  Jean and Madelyne confront each other  with Madelyne attempting to mind meld with Jean and kill them both  Jean manages to survive only by absorbing the remnant of the Phoenix Force housed within Madelyne  giving her both Madelyne s memories and the Phoenix s memories from  The Dark Phoenix Saga   21  Claremont later commented on how Jean s revival affected his original plans for Madelyne Pryor  stating that the relationship between the two women was intended to be entirely coincidental  22  He intended Madelyne only to look like Jean by complete coincidence and exist as a means for Cyclops to move on with his life and be written out of the X Men franchise  part of what he believed to be a natural progression for any member of the team  22  Claremont expressed dismay that Jean s resurrection ultimately resulted in Cyclops abandoning his wife and child  tarnishing his written persona as a hero and  decent human being   and the  untenable situation  with Madelyne being dealt with by transforming her into a prolicidal demonic villain and killing her off  22  Soon after the beginning publication of X Factor  Marvel also reprinted and released the original X Men series under the title  Classic X Men   These reissues paired the original stories with new vignettes  elaborating on plot points  One such issue  Classic X Men  8  April 1987   paired the original X Men  100  August 1976  story of Jean Grey s disastrous return flight from space immediately preceding her transformation into Phoenix   Love Hath No X Man      with the new story  Phoenix   The story further supported the retcon establishing Jean Grey and the Phoenix Force as two separate entities  The vignette elaborated on the events between X Men  100 and X Men  101  facing certain death from radiation poisoning  Jean Grey cries out for help to save the lives of her fellow X Men  Hearing her cry and sensing her intense passion for life and love for Scott and her friends  the Phoenix Force the  sum and substance of life  responds  offering to save her by bonding to her  coupling her humanity with its incredible power  Jean accepts and immediately finds her consciousness in a duplicated body  She places her former dying body  still containing a spark of her soul  in a healing cocoon  The duplicate  now calling itself Phoenix  proceeds to the events depicted in the original X Men  101  October 1976  story  Like A Phoenix  From The Ashes   with the cocoon sinking to the bottom of Jamaica Bay to be discovered in   Avengers  263  13   edit  Return to the X Men  1990s  Following the conclusion of Inferno  Jean continues to be a mainstay character throughout the rest of X Factor  rejecting a marriage proposal from Scott and meeting her alternate future daughter Rachel Summers  whom she also rejects out of the feeling that they both suggest her life is predetermined  23  24  She also regains her telepathy during a battle with the villain Psynapse  25  X Factor  1st Series  ended its run featuring the original X Men with X Factor  70  September  1991   with the characters transitioning over to Uncanny X Men  explained in continuity as the two teams deciding to merge together  The fourteen X Men divide into two teams  Blue  and  Gold  led by Cyclops and Storm  respectively  Jean is added to the Gold Team beginning in Uncanny X Men  281  October  1991   26  During this time  she is no longer given a codename  instead referred to by her full name  Jean Grey  In Uncanny X Men  308  January 1994   Jean proposes to Scott and the two marry in X Men  30 Jean has also  by this time  reconciled her initially hostile feelings toward Rachel and welcomes her into her life permanently   March  1994   27  Jean and Scott were immediately featured in the four part miniseries The Adventures of Cyclops  amp  Phoenix  where the two were psychically transported 2000 years into the future to raise Scott s son Nathan  who had been transported to the future as an infant in hopes of curing him of a deadly virus  The series depicted the couple assuming the names Redd  Jean  and Slym  Cyclops  and raising Nathan Christopher for twelve years before being sent back into their bodies on their wedding honeymoon  Before their return  Jean learns that Rachel had transported them to the future to protect Nathan  and per her request adopts the codename  Phoenix  once again to establish it as a symbol of good after all the bad it had caused  28  Jean continued to appear as a mainstay character in both X Men and Uncanny X Men including franchise wide crossovers like  The Phalanx Covenant  and the line wide crossover Onslaught  which featured the manifestation of Charles Xavier s dark half  The crossover revisited long untouched issues between Xavier and Jean  including Xavier s secret love for Jean mentioned in the original X Men comic series decades earlier  29  30  Jean also meets another alternate future child of hers and Scott  the immensely powerful Nathan Grey  who accidentally revives the psionic ghost of Madelyne Pryor  leading to another confrontation between the two women  31  While appearing in Uncanny X Men and X Men  Jean grows more comfortable with her immense psychic powers and begins using the iconic green and gold Phoenix costume again  32  She also brings together a quick team of X Men in the three issue revival of the Astonishing X Men title  33   edit  New X Men  2000s  Following Cyclops  possession by the mutant villain Apocalypse and disappearance in the conclusion of the crossover storyline  Apocalypse  The Twelve   34  35  Jean loses her telekinetic abilities and is left with increased psychic powers  the result of the  six month gap  in plot across the X Men franchise created by the Revolution revamp  During the Revolution event  all X Men titles began six months after the events of Apocalypse  the Twelve  allowing writers to create fresh situations and stories and gradually fill in the missing events of the previous six months of continuity  Due to editing decisions following the success of the 2000 X Men film  which depicted the character of Jean Grey with both telepathy and telekinesis  an explanation for Jean s altered powers in the comics was never explicitly made  though writer Chris Claremont revealed in interviews that it was intended to be an accidental power switch between fellow X Man Psylocke  explaining Psylocke s new telekinetic powers as well  Jean was next featured in the six issue miniseries X Men Forever written by Fabian Nicieza  which was designed to tie up remaining plot lines  During the series  Jean revisited many of the events involving the Phoenix Force and the series introduced the concept of  Omega level mutants   a category for mutants with unlimited potential  which includes Jean herself  36  Cable and Jean were the central characters in the 2001 miniseries X Men  Search for Cyclops where the two believe Cyclops to be alive  The two track Cyclops down and Jean is able to psychically free him from Apocalypse s possession  The couple then return as mainstay characters in X Men  2nd Series  once again  37  In June 2001  X Men was retitled as New X Men under writer Grant Morrison  The title consisted of a smaller team featuring Jean  Cyclops  Beast  Wolverine  Emma Frost  and Charles Xavier  The overarching plot focused on the team assuming the roles of teachers to a new generation of mutants at the Xavier Institute while navigating their personal relationships and dealing with newly emerging pro  and anti mutant political sentiments  38  The series sees the return of Jean s telekinesis  her emerging ability to tap into the powers of the Phoenix Force once again  her assumption of the duties as headmistress of the Xavier Institute  and the failing of her marriage to Scott following his traumatic experience being possessed by Apocalypse  38  Jean and Wolverine address their long unspoken mutual attraction  deciding it is best not to act on their feelings  while Scott begins feeling further alienated from Jean and seeks consolation from Emma Frost to address his disillusionment and his experiences while possessed by Apocalypse  38  These interactions lead to a  psychic affair  between Scott and Emma  Jean s discovery of the psychic affair results in a confrontation between her and Emma  though ultimately Jean realizes that her marriage to Scott has run its course  38  Jean also makes minor appearances in other titles during the New X Men run  such as Chris Claremont s X Treme X Men  occasionally lending support to the characters  39  New X Men concluded with Jean fully realizing and assuming the powers of the Phoenix under her complete control  However  in the final chapters of New X Men  she is killed in battle by Magneto  38  though Marvel later retconned her killer s identity to that of an imposter  40  The series also explored a dystopian future caused when Scott chooses not to run the Institute with Emma following Jean s death  This alternate future timeline  called  Here Comes Tomorrow   was the closing chapter of Grant Morrisson s run on New X Men  38  The story is eventually resolved by a resurrected Jean becoming the fully realized White Phoenix of the Crown and using the abilities of the Phoenix Force to reach back in time and influence Scott to accept Emma s offer to run the school together  38  Scott and Jean s relationship ends with her death and he and Emma assume the duties of co headmaster and co headmistress of the Xavier Institute under writer Chuck Austen s take over of New X Men and its change over to X Men under the editorial X Men ReLoad decision  Jean and her connection with the Phoenix Force was examined again one year after the conclusion of Morrison s run on New X Men in X Men  Phoenix   Endsong written by Greg Pak in 2005  41  In it  a fragmented Phoenix Force attempts to resurrect Jean  resulting in a struggle between herself and the X Men as she attempts to control the  Dark Phoenix  persona  The miniseries concluded with Jean resolving her relationship with Scott and moving on to a higher plane of existence with the Phoenix Force  41  The Phoenix Force as its own entity continued to be explored in other later titles  such as X Men  Phoenix   Warsong  2006  and Matt Fraction s run on Uncanny X Men  with brief references to Jean  42  At the 2010 San Diego Comic Con X Men panel  when asked whether or not Jean would return  editor Nick Lowe responded by saying   She s dead   43   edit   Re return  to publication Regarding Jean s actual return to the X Men franchise  Marvel indicated that Jean s eventual return is being discussed  but also stated that the return of Jean Grey was  a story Marvel does not want to rush   44  Marvel also loosely tied questions regarding Jean Grey s eventual return to the events in 2007 s X Men  Messiah Complex in which a mutant girl named Hope who has red hair  green eyes  and immense mutant powers is born 45  and 2010 s X Men  Second Coming which sees both Hope s return as an adult and the return of the Phoenix Force

dystopic future by reaching back in time and influencing Cyclops to accept Emma s love and her offer to run the school together  52  Jean then reconciles with Cyclops and fully bonds with the Phoenix Force and ascends to a higher plane of existence called the  White Hot Room   41  Though she has yet to fully return  the Phoenix Force continues to manifest itself  particularly through the red haired  green eyed  mutant messiah  Hope Summers  53  and Jean briefly appears in a vision to Emma Frost from the White Hot Room  telling the X Men to  prepare   54   edit  Powers and abilities Jean Grey is an Omega level mutant  and at her highest potential is transformed into the Phoenix Force   edit  Telepathy When her powers first manifest  Jean is unable to cope with her telepathy  forcing Professor X to suppress her access to it altogether  Instead  he chooses to train her in the use of her telekinesis while allowing her telepathy to grow at its natural rate before reintroducing it  55  This is why in Jean s debut appearance as Marvel Girl  she is only capable of using her telekinetic powers  citation needed  When the Professor hides to prepare for the Z Nox  he reopens Jean s telepathic powers  which was initially explained as Xavier  sharing  some of his telepathy with her  56  Jean s telepathy allows her to read  influence  control  and communicate with the minds of others  project her mind into the astral plane  and generate telepathic force blasts that can stun or kill others  Jean is one of the few telepaths skilled enough to communicate with animals  animals with high intelligence  such as dolphins  57 dogs  58  and ravens 59    She can also telepathically take away or control people s natural bodily functions and senses  such as sight  hearing  smell  taste  or even mutant powers  A side effect of her telepathy is that she is gifted with an eidetic memory  60  Jean was able  through telepathic therapy with the comatose Jessica Jones  to grant Jessica immunity to the Purple Man s mind control abilities  despite his powers being chemical in nature rather than psychic  volume  amp  issue needed  When Jean absorbs Psylocke s specialized telepathic powers  her own telepathy is increased to the point that she can physically manifest her telepathy as a psionic firebird whose claws can inflict both physical and mental damage  Phoenix discovers that she can telepathically enhance the powers of other mutants  volume  amp  issue needed  She briefly develops a psychic shadow form like Psylocke s  with a gold Phoenix emblem over her eye instead of the Crimson Dawn mark possessed by Psylocke  Jean briefly lost her telekinesis to Psylocke during this exchange  but her telekinetic abilities later came back in full at a far stronger level than before   edit  Telekinesis Her telekinetic strength and skill are both of an extremely high level  capable of grasping objects in Earth orbit and manipulating hundreds of components in mid air in complex patterns  She uses her telekinesis to often lift herself and others giving her the ability of levitation and flight  She also uses her telekinesis to create durable shields and energy blasts  She later manifests a  telekinetic sensitivity   called  the Manifestation of the Phoenix  38   to objects in her immediate environment that lets her feel the texture of objects  their molecular patterns  feel when other objects come into contact with them  and probe them at a molecular level   edit  Phoenix Force When transformed into Phoenix  Jean s powers escalate to an incalculable level  allowing her to rearrange matter at a subatomic level  fly unaided through space  survive in any atmosphere  and manipulate electromagnetic and cosmic energies for various effects and atmospheric disturbances  She can also create stargates that can transport her to anywhere in the universe instantaneously  At this level  she is powerful enough to easily defeat a herald of Galactus  61  Jean  while acting as a Phoenix Force avatar  can create  cosmic  flames  even in seemingly impossible situations such as the vacuum of space or underwater  Typically they manifest as a raptor or part of a raptor such as a claw or wings  Jean has perfect control over these flames  and they only consume what she wills  and these flames do not require oxygen to burn  and burn so intensely that matter is consumed without by products such as ash  It is unclear whether these flames are an extension of her telekinesis and telepathy or a more general property of the Phoenix Force  The cosmic flames are also a literal punctuation to the Phoenix s purpose to  burn away what doesn t work   as well as being described as  burning through lies  and deception  As the Phoenix  Jean is also able to resurrect after death  In some depictions  these resurrections are immediately after she is killed  while other depictions indicate that resurrection must occur at a  correct  time  sometimes taking a century  The Phoenix Force allows Jean to revive  absorb  rechannel  and preserve the life force of any kind of life form  meaning that she can take life energy from one person and give it to others  heal herself with the same life energy  or even resurrect the dead  since the Phoenix is the sum of all life and death  14  The relationship between Jean Grey and the Phoenix  and the nature of the powers she has  is portrayed in a variety of ways throughout the character s history  In the initial plotline of the Phoenix being a manifestation of Jean s true potential  these powers are considered her own  14  as part of Claremont and Byrne s desire to create  the first cosmic superheroine   9  However  since the retcon of the Phoenix as a separate entity from Jean Grey  depictions of these powers vary  these include Jean being one of many hosts to the Phoenix and  borrowing  its  Phoenix powers  during this time  38  62  being a unique host to the Phoenix  38  and being one with the Phoenix  14  41  She is later described as holding the unique title of  White Phoenix of the Crown  among the many past  present  and future hosts of the Phoenix  52  As the White Phoenix  Jean can manipulate and control whole timelines  52   edit  Education Jean Grey is also a college graduate from Metro College with a select education in psychology  volume  amp  issue needed
