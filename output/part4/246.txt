Tuberculosis From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Tuberculosis Classification and external resources Chest X ray of a person with advanced tuberculosis ICD 10 A15 A19 ICD 9 010 018 OMIM 607948 DiseasesDB 8515 MedlinePlus 000077 000624 eMedicine med 2324 emerg 618 radio 411 MeSH D014376 Tuberculosis  MTB  or TB  short for tubercle bacillus  is a common  and in many cases lethal  infectious disease caused by various strains of mycobacteria  usually Mycobacterium tuberculosis  1  Tuberculosis usually attacks the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body  It is spread through the air when people who have an active MTB infection cough  sneeze  or otherwise transmit their saliva through the air  2  Most infections in humans result in an asymptomatic  latent infection  and about one in ten latent infections eventually progress to active disease  which  if left untreated  kills more than 50  of those infected  The classic symptoms are a chronic cough with blood tinged sputum  fever  night sweats  and weight loss  the last giving rise to the formerly prevalent colloquial term  consumption    Infection of other organs causes a wide range of symptoms  Diagnosis relies on radiology  commonly chest X rays   a tuberculin skin test  blood tests  as well as microscopic examination and microbiological culture of bodily fluids  Treatment is difficult and requires long courses of multiple antibiotics  Social contacts are also screened and treated if necessary  Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem in  extensively  multi drug resistant tuberculosis  Prevention relies on screening programs and vaccination  usually with Bacillus Calmette Gu rin vaccine  One third of the world s population is thought to have been infected with M  tuberculosis  3  4  and new infections occur at a rate of about one per second  3  In 2007 there were an estimated 13 7 million chronic active cases  5  and in 2010 8 8 million new cases  and 1 45 million deaths  mostly in developing countries  6  The absolute number of tuberculosis cases has been decreasing since 2006 and new cases since 2002  6  In addition  more people in the developing world contract tuberculosis because their immune systems are more likely to be compromised due to higher rates of AIDS  7  The distribution of tuberculosis is not uniform across the globe  about 80  of the population in many Asian and African countries test positive in tuberculin tests  while only 5 10  of the U S  population test positive  1  Contents 1 Signs and symptoms 1 1 Pulmonary 1 2

symptoms of variants and stages of tuberculosis  8  with many symptoms overlapping with other variants  while others are more  but not entirely  specific for certain variants  Multiple variants may be present simultaneously  Only about 5 10  of those infected with tuberculosis  without HIV  develop active disease  9  In contrast 30  of those co infected with HIV develop active disease  9  Extrapulmonary TB may co exist with pulmonary TB  10  Pulmonary If tuberculosis does become active  it most commonly involves infection in the lungs  pulmonary TB   7  Symptoms include chest pain and a productive  prolonged cough  About a quarter of people however may not have any symptoms  7  Occasionally people may cough up blood in small amounts and in very rare cases the infection may erode into the pulmonary artery resulting in massive bleeding known as Rasmussen s aneurysm  10  Spitting up stones known as lithoptysis has been described due to bronchial lymph nodes communicated with the airways  10  Tuberculosis may become chronic with scarring usually in the upper lobes of the lungs  10  It is believed that the upper lungs are more frequently affected due to their poor lymph supply rather than more air flow  10  Extrapulmonary In the other 25  of active cases  the infection moves from the lungs  causing other kinds of TB  collectively denoted extrapulmonary tuberculosis  11  This occurs more commonly in immunosuppressed persons and young children  Extrapulmonary infection sites include the pleura in tuberculous pleurisy  the central nervous system in meningitis  the lymphatic system in scrofula of the neck  the genitourinary system in urogenital tuberculosis  and the bones and joints in Pott s disease of the spine  When spread to the bones it is also known as  osseous tuberculosis   12  a form of osteomyelitis  as a complication of tuberculosis 1    A potentially more serious form is disseminated TB  more commonly known as miliary tuberculosis  10  Constitutional Systemic symptoms include fever  chills  night sweats  appetite loss  weight loss  and fatigue  10 Finger clubbing may also occur  9  Causes Mycobacterium Main article  Mycobacterium tuberculosis Scanning electron micrograph of Mycobacterium tuberculosis The main cause of TB is  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  a small aerobic non motile bacillus or less commonly the closely related Mycobacterium bovis  10  The high lipid content of this pathogen accounts for many of its unique clinical characteristics  13  It divides every 16 to 20 hours  an extremely slow rate compared with other bacteria  which usually divide in less than an hour  14  Since MTB has a cell wall but lacks a phospholipid outer membrane  it is classified as a Gram positive bacterium  However  if a Gram stain is performed  MTB either stains very weakly Gram positive or does not retain dye as a result of the high lipid and mycolic acid content of its cell wall  15  MTB can withstand weak disinfectants and survive in a dry state for weeks  In nature  the bacterium can grow only within the cells of a host organism  but M  tuberculosis can be cultured in the laboratory  16  Using histological stains on expectorate samples from phlegm  also called sputum   scientists can identify MTB under a regular microscope  Since MTB retains certain stains after being treated with acidic solution  it is classified as an acid fast bacillus  AFB   1  15  The most common acid fast staining technique  the Ziehl Neelsen stain  dyes AFBs a bright red that stands out clearly against a blue background  Other ways to visualize AFBs include an auramine rhodamine stain and fluorescent microscopy  The M  tuberculosis complex includes four other TB causing mycobacteria  M  bovis  M  africanum  M  canetti  and M  microti  17 M  africanum is not widespread  but in parts of Africa it is a significant cause of tuberculosis  18  19 M  bovis was once a common cause of tuberculosis  but the introduction of pasteurized milk has largely eliminated this as a public health problem in developed countries  1  20 M  canetti is rare and seems to be limited to Africa  although a few cases have been seen in African emigrants  21 M  microti is mostly seen in immunodeficient people  although it is possible that the prevalence of this pathogen has been underestimated  22  Other known pathogenic mycobacteria include Mycobacterium leprae  Mycobacterium avium  and M  kansasii  The latter two are part of the nontuberculous mycobacteria  NTM  group  Nontuberculous mycobacteria cause neither TB nor leprosy  but they do cause pulmonary diseases resembling TB  23  Risk factors Main article  Risk factors for tuberculosis There are a number factors that make people more susceptible to TB infections  Worldwide the most important of these is HIV with co infection present in about 13  of cases  6  This is a particular problem in Sub Saharan Africa where rates of HIV are high  24  25  Tuberculosis is closely linked to both overcrowding and malnutrition making it one of the principal diseases of poverty  7  Chronic lung disease is a risk factor with smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day increasing the risk by two to four times 26  and silicosis increasing the risk about 30 fold  27  Other disease states that increase the risk of developing tuberculosis include alcoholism 7  and diabetes mellitus  threefold increase   28  Certain medications such as corticosteroids and Infliximab  an anti  TNF monoclonal antibody  are becoming increasingly important risk factors  especially in the developed world  7  There is also a genetic susceptibility 29  for which overall importance is still undefined  7  Mechanism Public health campaigns tried to halt the spread of TB  Transmission When people with active pulmonary TB cough  sneeze  speak  sing  or spit  they expel infectious aerosol droplets 0 5 to 5  m in diameter  A single sneeze can release up to 40 000 droplets  30  Each one of these droplets may transmit the disease  since the infectious dose of tuberculosis is very low and inhaling fewer than ten bacteria may cause an infection  31  People with prolonged  frequent  or close contact are at particularly high risk of becoming infected  with an estimated 22  infection rate  32   A person with active but untreated tuberculosis can infect 10 15 other people per year  3  Others at risk include people in areas where TB is common  people who inject illicit drugs  inhabitants and employees of vulnerable congregate settings  medically under privileged and resource poor populations  high risk racial or ethnic minority groups  children in close contact with high risk category patients  those who are immunocompromised by conditions such as HIV AIDS  people who take immunosuppressant drugs  and health care providers and nurses serving these clients  33  Transmission can only occur from people with active not latent TB  1  The probability of transmission from one person to another depends upon the number of infectious droplets expelled by a carrier  the effectiveness of ventilation  the duration of exposure  and the virulence of the M  tuberculosis strain  34  The cascade of person to person spread can be circumvented by effective segregation of those with active  overt  TB and putting them on recommended anti TB regimen  After about two weeks of such treatment  subjects with non resistant active infection generally do not remain as potential source of infection for contacts  32   If someone does become infected  then it will take three to four weeks before the newly infected person can transmit the disease to others  35  Pathogenesis About 90  of those infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis have asymptomatic  latent TB infection  sometimes called LTBI   with only a 10  lifetime chance that a latent infection will progress to TB disease  1  However  if untreated  the death rate for these active TB cases is more than 50   3  TB infection begins when the mycobacteria reach the pulmonary alveoli  where they invade and replicate within the endosomes of alveolar macrophages  1  36  The primary site of infection in the lungs is called the Ghon focus  and is generally located in either the upper part of the lower lobe  or the lower part of the upper lobe  1 Simon foci may also be present  Bacteria are picked up by dendritic cells  which do not allow replication  although these cells can transport the bacilli to local  mediastinal  lymph nodes  Further spread is through the bloodstream to other tissues and organs where secondary TB lesions can develop in other parts of the lung  particularly the apex of the upper lobes   peripheral lymph nodes  kidneys  brain  and bone  1  37  All parts of the body can be affected by the disease  though it rarely affects the heart  skeletal muscles  pancreas and thyroid  38  Tuberculosis is classified as one of the granulomatous inflammatory conditions  Macrophages  T lymphocytes  B lymphocytes  and fibroblasts are among the cells that aggregate to form granulomas  with lymphocytes surrounding the infected macrophages  The granuloma prevents dissemination of the mycobacteria and provides a local environment for interaction of cells of the immune system  Bacteria inside the granuloma can become dormant  resulting in a latent infection  Another feature of the granulomas of human tuberculosis is the development of abnormal cell death  necrosis  in the center of tubercles  To the naked eye this has the texture of soft white cheese and is termed caseous necrosis  39  If TB bacteria gain entry to the bloodstream from an area of damaged tissue they spread through the body and set up many foci of infection  all appearing as tiny white tubercles in the tissues  This severe form of TB disease is most common in infants and the elderly and is called miliary tuberculosis  People with this disseminated TB have a fatality rate near 100  if untreated  However  if treated early  the fatality rate is reduced to about 10   40  In many people the infection waxes and wanes  Tissue destruction and necrosis are balanced by healing and fibrosis  39  Affected tissue is replaced by scarring and cavities filled with cheese like white necrotic material  During active disease  some of these cavities are joined to the air passages bronchi and this material can be coughed up  It contains living bacteria and can therefore spread the infection  Treatment with appropriate antibiotics kills bacteria and allows healing to take place  Upon cure  affected areas are eventually replaced by scar tissue  39  Diagnosis Main articles  Tuberculosis diagnosis and Tuberculosis classification Mycobacterium tuberculosis  stained red  in sputum Tuberculosis is diagnosed definitively by identifying the causative organism  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  in a clinical sample  for example  sputum or pus   When this is not possible  a probable although sometimes inconclusive 2  diagnosis may be made using imaging  X rays or scans   a tuberculin skin test  Mantoux test   2  or a  Interferon Gamma Release Assay  IGRA   The main problem with tuberculosis diagnosis is the difficulty in culturing this slow growing organism in the laboratory  it may take 4 to 12 weeks for blood or sputum culture   A complete medical evaluation for TB must include a medical history  a physical examination  a chest X ray  microbiological smears  and cultures  It may also include a tuberculin skin test  a serological test  The interpretation of the tuberculin skin test depends upon the person s risk factors for infection and progression to TB disease  such as exposure to other cases of TB or immunosuppression  34  New TB tests have been developed that are fast and accurate  These include polymerase chain reaction assays for the detection of bacterial DNA  41  One such molecular diagnostics test gives results in 100 minutes and is currently being offered to 116 low  and middle income countries at a discount with support from WHO and the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation  42  Another such test  which was approved by the FDA in 1996  is the amplified mycobacterium tuberculosis direct test  MTD  Gen Probe   This test yields results in 2 5 to 3 5 hours  and it is highly sensitive and specific when used to test smears positive for acid fast bacilli  AFB   43  Screening Mantoux tuberculin skin test Mantoux tuberculin skin tests are often used for routine screening of high risk individuals  44  Currently  latent infection is diagnosed in a non immunized person by a tuberculin skin test  which yields a delayed hypersensitivity type response to an extract made from M  tuberculosis  1  Those immunized for TB or with past cleared infection will respond with delayed hypersensitivity parallel to those currently in a state of infection  so the test must be used with caution  particularly with regard to persons from countries where TB immunization is common  45  Tuberculin tests have the disadvantage of producing false negatives  especially when the person is co morbid with sarcoidosis  Hodgkins lymphoma  malnutrition  or most notably active tuberculosis disease  1  The newer interferon release assays  IGRAs  such as T SPOT TB and QuantiFERON TB Gold In Tube overcome many of these problems  IGRAs are in vitro blood tests that are more specific than the skin test  IGRAs detect the release of interferon gamma in response to mycobacterial proteins such as ESAT 6  46  These are not affected by immunization or environmental mycobacteria  so generate fewer false positive results  47  There is also evidence that IGRAs are more sensitive than the skin test  48  Prevention Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts primarily rely on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases  7  The World Health Organization has achieved some success with improved treatment success and a small decrease in case numbers  7  Vaccines The only currently available vaccine as of 2011 is Bacillus Calmette Gu rin  BCG  which while effective against disseminated disease in childhood  confers inconsistent protection against pulmonary disease  49  It is the most widely used vaccine worldwide with more than 90  of children vaccinated  7  However the immunity that it induces  decreases after about ten years  7  As tuberculosis is uncommon in most of Canada  the United Kingdom and the United States  BCG is only administered to people at high risk  50  51  52  Part of the reason against the use of vaccine is that it makes the tuberculin skin test falsely positive and thus of no use in screening  52  A number of new vaccines are in development  7  Public health The World Health Organization  WHO  declared TB a global health emergency in 1993  7  and in 2006 the Stop TB Partnership developed a Global Plan to Stop Tuberculosis that aims to save 14 million lives between its launch and 2015  53  A number of targets that they have set are not likely to be achieved by 2015 due to the increase in HIV associated tuberculosis and multi drug resistant tuberculosis  7  Treatment Main article  Tuberculosis treatment Treatment for TB uses antibiotics to kill the bacteria  Effective TB treatment is difficult  due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall  which makes many antibiotics ineffective and hinders the entry of drugs  54  The two antibiotics most commonly used are isoniazid and rifampicin and treatments can be prolonged  34  Latent TB treatment usually uses a single antibiotic  while active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics  to reduce the risk of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance  55  People with latent infections are treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life  New onset The recommended treatment of new onset pulmonary tuberculosis as of 2010 is six months of a combination of antibiotic containing rifampin along isoniazid  pyrazinamide and ethambutol for the first two months and with just isoniazid for the last four months  7  Where resistance to insoniazid is high ethambutol may be added for the last four months  7  Recurrent disease If tuberculosis recurs  testing to determine what antibiotics it is sensitive to is important before determining treatment  7  If multi drug resistant tuberculosis is detected  treatment with at least four effective antibiotics for 18 24 month is recommended  7  Medication resistance Primary resistance occurs in persons infected with a resistant strain of TB  A person with fully susceptible TB develops secondary resistance  acquired resistance  during TB therapy because of inadequate treatment  not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately  or using low quality medication  55  Drug resistant TB is a public health issue in many developing countries  as treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs  Multi drug resistant tuberculosis  MDR TB  is defined as resistance to the two most effective first line TB drugs  rifampicin and isoniazid  Extensively drug resistant TB  XDR TB  is also resistant to three or more of the six classes of second line drugs  56 Totally drug resistant TB  TDR TB   which was first observed in 2003 in Italy  but not widely reported until 2012  is resistant to all currently used drugs  57  Prognosis Progression from TB infection to TB disease occurs when the TB bacilli overcome the immune system defenses and begin to multiply  In primary TB disease 1 5  of cases this occurs soon after infection  1  However  in the majority of cases  a latent infection occurs that has no obvious symptoms  1  These dormant bacilli can produce tuberculosis in 2 23  of these latent cases  often many years after infection  58  The risk of reactivation increases with immunosuppression  such as that caused by infection with HIV  In people co infected with M  tuberculosis and HIV  the risk of reactivation increases to 10  per year  1  Studies utilizing DNA fingerprinting of M  tuberculosis strains have shown that reinfection contributes more substantially to recurrent TB than previously thought  59  with estimates that it might account for more than 50  in areas where TB is common  60  The chance of death from a case of tuberculosis is about 4   7  Epidemiology Age standardized death from tuberculosis per 100 000 inhabitants in 2004  61    no data     10   10 25   25 50   50 75   75 100   100 250   250 500   500 750   750 1000   1000 2000   2000 3000     3000 In 2007  the prevalence of TB per 100 000 people was highest in sub Saharan Africa  and was also relatively high in Asia  62  Annual number of new reported TB cases  Data from WHO  63  Roughly a third of the world s population has been infected with M  tuberculosis  and new infections occur at a rate of one per second  3  However  not all infections with M  tuberculosis cause TB disease and many infections are asymptomatic  64  In 2007 there were an estimated 13 7 million chronic active cases  5  and in 2010  8 8 million new cases  and 1 45 million deaths  mostly in developing countries  6  The absolute number of tuberculosis cases has been decreasing since 2005 and new cases since 2002  6  China has achieved particularly dramatic progress  with an 80 percent decline in its TB mortality rate  65  The distribution of tuberculosis is not uniform across the globe  about 80  of the population in many Asian and African countries test positive in tuberculin tests  while only 5 10  of the U S  population test positive  1  Tuberculosis is the world s greatest infectious killer of women of reproductive age and the leading cause of death among people with HIV AIDS  66  This is due to the fact that worldwide  women have a larger burden from poverty  ill health  malnutrition and disease than men  Tuberculosis results in more deaths among women than all causes of maternal mortality combined  and more than 900 million women are infected with TB worldwide  It also kills more young people and adults than any other known infectious disease  67  The rise in HIV infections and the neglect of TB control programs have enabled a resurgence of tuberculosis  68  The emergence of drug resistant strains has also contributed to this new epidemic with  from 2000 to 2004  20  of TB cases being resistant to standard treatments and 2  resistant to second line drugs  56  The rate at which new TB cases occur varies widely  even in neighbouring countries  apparently because of differences in health care systems  69  In 2007  the country with the highest estimated incidence rate of TB was Swaziland  with 1200 cases per 100 000 people  India had the largest total incidence  with an estimated 2 0 million new cases  5  In developed countries  tuberculosis is less common and is mainly an urban disease  In the United Kingdom  the national average was 15 per 100 000 in 2007  and the highest incidence rates in Western Europe were 30 per 100 000 in Portugal and Spain  These rates compared with 98 per 100 000 in China and 48 per 100 000 in Brazil  In the United States  the overall tuberculosis case rate was 4 per 100 000 persons in 2007  62  In Canada  tuberculosis is still endemic in some rural areas  70  The incidence of TB varies with age  In Africa  TB primarily affects adolescents and young adults  71  However  in countries where TB has gone from high to low incidence  such as the United States  TB is mainly a disease of older people  or of the immunocompromised  1  72  History Main article  History of tuberculosis Egyptian mummy in the British Museum  Tubercular decay has been found in the spines of Egyptian mummies  Tuberculosis has been present in humans since antiquity  7  The earliest unambiguous detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is in the remains of bison dated 17 000 years before the present  73  However  whether tuberculosis originated in cattle and then transferred to humans  or diverged from a common ancestor  is currently unclear  74  Although  there is evidence following a comparative genomic approach of MTBC in humans to MTBC in animals that suggests that humans did not acquire MTBC from animals during animal domestication as previously believed  Both strains of the tuberculosis bacteria are shown to share a common ancestor  which could have infected humans as early as the Neolithic transition  75  Skeletal remains show prehistoric humans  4000 BCE  had TB  and researchers have found tubercular decay in the spines of Egyptian mummies dating from 3000 2400 BCE  76  Phthisis is a Greek term for consumption  around 460 BCE  Hippocrates identified phthisis as the most widespread disease of the times involving coughing up blood and fever  which was almost always fatal  77  Genetic studies suggest that TB was present in The Americas from about the year 100 CE  78  Before the Industrial Revolution  folklore often associated tuberculosis with vampires  When one member of a family died from it  the other members that were infected would lose their health slowly  People believed that this was caused by the original victim draining the life from the other family members  79  Although it was established that the pulmonary form was associated with  tubercles  by Dr Richard Morton in 1689  80  81  due to the variety of its symptoms  TB was not identified as a single disease until the 1820s and was not named  tuberculosis  until 1839 by J  L  Sch nlein  82  During the years 1838 1845  Dr  John Croghan  the owner of Mammoth Cave  brought a number of tuberculosis sufferers into the cave in the hope of curing the disease with the constant temperature and purity of the cave air  they died within a year  83  Hermann Brehmer opened the first TB sanatorium in 1859 in Soko owsko  Poland  84  Dr  Robert Koch discovered the tuberculosis bacilli  The bacillus causing tuberculosis  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  was identified and described on 24 March 1882 by Robert Koch  He received the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1905 for this discovery  85  Koch did not believe that bovine  cattle  and human tuberculosis were similar  which delayed the recognition of infected milk as a source of infection  Later  this source was eliminated by the pasteurization process  Koch announced a glycerine extract of the tubercle bacilli as a  remedy  for tuberculosis in 1890  calling it  tuberculin   It was not effective  but was later adapted as a test for pre symptomatic tuberculosis  86  Albert Calmette and Camille Guerin achieved the first genuine success in immunizing against tuberculosis in 1906  using attenuated bovine strain tuberculosis  It was called  BCG   Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin   The BCG vaccine was first used on humans in 1921 in France  87  but it wasn t until after World War II that BCG received widespread acceptance in the USA  Great Britain  and Germany  88  Tuberculosis caused the most widespread public concern in the 19th and early 20th centuries as an endemic disease of the urban poor  In 1815  one in four deaths in England was of consumption  by 1918 one in six deaths in France were still caused by TB  After the establishment in the 1880s that the disease was contagious  TB was made a notifiable disease in Britain  there were campaigns to stop spitting in public places  and the infected poor were  encouraged  to enter sanatoria that resembled prisons  the sanatoria for the middle and upper classes offered excellent care and constant medical attention  84  Whatever the purported benefits of the fresh air and labor in the sanatoria  even under the best conditions  50  of those who entered were dead within five years  1916   84  The promotion of Christmas Seals began in Denmark during 1904 as a way to raise money for tuberculosis programs  It expanded to the United States and Canada in 1907 1908 to help the National Tuberculosis Association  later called the American Lung Association   In the United States  concern about the spread of tuberculosis played a role in the movement to prohibit public spitting except into spittoons  In Europe  deaths from TB fell from 500 out of 100 000 in 1850 to 50 out of 100 000 by 1950  Improvements in public health were reducing tuberculosis even before the arrival of antibiotics  although the disease remained a significant threat to public health  such that when the Medical Research Council was formed in Britain in 1913 its initial focus was tuberculosis research  89  It was not until 1946 with the development of the antibiotic streptomycin that effective treatment and cure became possible  Prior to the introduction of this drug  the only treatment besides sanatoria were surgical interventions  including the pneumothorax technique collapsing an infected lung to  rest  it and allow lesions to heal a technique that was of little benefit and was largely discontinued by the 1950s  90  The emergence of multidrug resistant TB has again introduced surgery as part of the treatment for these infections  Here  surgical removal of chest cavities will reduce the number of bacteria in the lungs  as well as increasing the exposure of the remaining bacteria to drugs in the bloodstream  and is therefore thought to increase the effectiveness of the chemotherapy  91  Hopes of completely eliminating the disease were dashed following the rise of drug resistant strains in the 1980s  For example  tuberculosis cases in Britain  numbering around 50 000 in 1955  had fallen to around 5 500 in 1987  but in 2000 there were over 7 000 confirmed cases  citation needed  Due to the elimination of public health facilities in New York and the emergence of HIV  there was a resurgence in the late 1980s  92  The number of those failing to complete their course of drugs is high  NY had to cope with more than 20 000  unnecessary  TB patients with multidrug resistant strains  resistant to  at least  both Rifampin and Isoniazid   The resurgence of tuberculosis resulted in the declaration of a global health emergency by the World Health Organization in 1993  93  In other animals Tuberculosis can be carried by mammals  domesticated species  such as cats and dogs  are generally free of tuberculosis  but wild animals may be carriers  In some places  regulations aiming to prevent the spread of TB restrict the ownership of novelty pets  for example  the U S  state of California forbids the ownership of pet gerbils  94  Mycobacterium bovis causes TB in cattle  An effort to eradicate bovine tuberculosis from the cattle and deer herds of New Zealand is under way  It has been found that herd infection is more likely in areas where infected vector species such as Australian brush tailed possums come into contact with domestic livestock at farm bush borders  95  Controlling the vectors through possum eradication and monitoring the level of disease in livestock herds through regular surveillance are seen as a  two pronged  approach to ridding New Zealand of the disease  In both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland  badgers have been identified as a vector species for the transmission of bovine tuberculosis  As a result  the government in both regions has mounted an active campaign of eradication of the species in an effort to reduce the incidence of the disease  Badgers have been culled primarily by snaring and gassing  It remains a contentious issue  with proponents and opponents of the scheme citing their own studies to support their position  96  97  98  Research Several new vaccines to prevent TB infection are being developed  among others by Aeras and TBVI  The first recombinant tuberculosis vaccine  Mtb72F  entered clinical trials in the United States in 2004  sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  NIAID   99  100  A 2005 study showed that a DNA TB vaccine given with conventional chemotherapy can accelerate the disappearance of bacteria as well as protect against re infection in mice  it may take four to five years to be available in humans  101  Another TB vaccine  MVA85A  is currently in phase II trials in South Africa  102  and is based on a genetically modified vaccinia virus  Many other strategies are also being used to develop novel vaccines  103  including both subunit vaccines  fusion molecules composed of two recombinant proteins delivered in an adjuvant  such as Hybrid 1  HyVac4  or M72  and recombinant adenoviruses such as Ad35  104  105  106  107  Some of these vaccines can be effectively administered without needles  making them preferable for areas where HIV is common  108  All of these vaccines have been successfully tested in humans and are now in extended testing in TB endemic regions  To encourage further discovery  researchers and policymakers are promoting new economic models of vaccine development including prizes  tax incentives  and advance market commitments  109  110  An experimental vaccine  with positive results in mouse models  may be effective not only in preventing infection  but also in eradicating the infection once it has been established  111  A tuberculosis vaccine aimed at sterile Mtb eradication should be able to target latent Mtb as well as Mtb that causes early stage tuberculosis  112  The vaccine is a combination of antigens Ag85B and ESAT 6 as well as the protein Rv2660c  Ag85B and ESAT 6 together form the vaccine Hybrid 1  while Rv2660c is a protein that is expressed even in late stage infections  when protein transcription is generally reduced  The novel combination of Ag85B  ESAT 6  and Rv2660c allows for both short
