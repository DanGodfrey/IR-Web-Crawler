Spanish  Canarias  Berber Taknara 7    is a Spanish archipelago located just off the northwest coast of mainland Africa  100 km west of the border between Morocco and the Western Sahara  The Canaries are a Spanish autonomous community and an outermost region of the European Union  The islands include  from largest to smallest   Tenerife  Fuerteventura  Gran Canaria  Lanzarote  La Palma  La Gomera  El Hierro  La Graciosa  Alegranza  Isla de Lobos  Monta a Clara  Roque del Este and Roque del Oeste  The Canary Islands are legally recognized as a nationality of Spain  Geographically it is a part of the African Continent  The archipelago s beaches  climate and important natural attractions  especially Teide National Park and Mount Teide  the third tallest volcano in the world   make it a major tourist destination  with over 12 million visitors per year  especially Tenerife  Gran Canaria and Lanzarote  8  9  The islands have a subtropical climate  with long warm summers and moderately warm winters  10  Due to their location above the temperature inversion layer  these islands are ideal for astronomical observation  For this reason  two professional observatories  Teide Observatory on the island of Tenerife and Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the island of La Palma  have been built on the islands  The capital for the Autonomous Community is shared by the cities of Las Palmas and Santa Cruz  11  12  which in turn are the capitals of the provinces of Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Province of Las Palmas  Las Palmas de Gran Canaria has been the largest city in the Canaries since 1768  except for a brief period in 1910  13  Between the 1833 territorial division of Spain and 1927 Santa Cruz de Tenerife was the sole capital of the Canary Islands  until 1927 when a decree ordered that the capital of the Canary Islands be shared  as it remains at present  14  15  The third largest city of the Canary Islands is La Laguna  a World Heritage Site  on Tenerife  16  17  18  During the times of the Spanish Empire the Canaries were the main stopover for Spanish galleons on their way to America because of the favorable easterly winds  19  Contents 1 Etymology 2 Geography 2 1

applied originally only to Gran Canaria  According to the historian Pliny the Elder  the Mauritanian king Juba II named the island Canaria because it contained  vast multitudes of dogs of very large size   20  Another speculation is that the so called dogs were actually a species of Monk Seals  canis marinus or  sea dog  was a Latin term for  seal  21    critically endangered and no longer present in the Canary Islands  22  The dense population of seals may have been the characteristic that most struck the few ancient Romans who established contact with these islands by sea  Alternatively  it is said that the original inhabitants of the island  Guanches  used to worship dogs  mummified them and treated dogs generally as holy animals  23  The ancient Greeks also knew about a people  living far to the west  who are the  dog headed ones   who worshipped dogs on an island  23  Some hypothesize that the Canary Islands dog worship and the ancient Egyptian cult of the dog headed god  Anubis are closely connected 24  but there is no explanation given as to which one was first  The connection to dogs is retained in their depiction on the islands  coat of arms  shown

at the left and Roque Bentayga at the center Tenerife  with 865 070 inhabitants  is both the Canary Islands  and Spain s most populous island  Tenerife is also the largest island of the archipelago  The island of Fuerteventura is the second largest in the archipelago and located 100 km from the African coast  The islands form the Macaronesia ecoregion with the Azores  Cape Verde  Madeira  and the Savage Isles  The archipelago consists of seven large and several smaller islands  all of which are volcanic in origin  25  The Teide volcano on Tenerife is the highest mountain in Spain  and the third tallest volcano on Earth on a volcanic ocean island  All the islands except La Gomera have been active in the last million years  four of them  Lanzarote  Tenerife  La Palma and El Hierro  have historical records of eruptions since European discovery  The islands rise from Jurassic oceanic crust associated with the opening of the Atlantic  Underwater magmatism commenced during the Cretaceous  and reached the ocean s surface during the Miocene  The islands are considered as a distinct physiographic section of the Atlas Mountains province  which in turn is part of the larger African Alpine System division  According to the position of the islands with respect to the north east trade winds  the climate can be mild and wet or very dry  Several native species form laurisilva forests  Pinus canariensis on the slopes of Teide in Tenerife Vegetation on Fuerteventura  a typical arid member of the Canaries archipelego As a consequence  the individual islands in the canary archipelego tend to have distinct microclimates  Those islands such as El Hierro  La Palma and La Gomera lying to the west of the archipelego have a climate which is influenced by the moist gulf stream  They are well vegetated even at low levels and have extensive tracts of sub tropical laurisilva forest  As one travels east toward the African coast  the influence of the gulf stream diminishes  and the islands become increasingly arid  Fuerteventura and Lanzarote the islands which are closest to the African mainland are effectively desert or semi desert  In terms of its climate Tenerife is particularly interesting  The north of the island lies under the influence of the moist atlantic winds and is well vegetated  while the south of the island around the tourist resorts of Playa de las Americas and Los Cristianos is arid  The island rises to some 4000 metres above sea level  and at altitude  in the cool relatively wet climate  forests of the endemic pine Pinus canariensis thrive  Many of the plant species in the Canary Islands  like the Canary Island pine and the dragon tree  Dracaena draco are endemic as noted by Sabin Berthelot and Philip Barker Webb in their epic work  L Histoire Naturelle des  les Canaries  1835 50   Four of Spain s thirteen national parks are located in the Canary Islands  more than any other autonomous community  Teide National Park is the most visited in

Province Municipalities in the Santa Cruz de Tenerife Province Maps of the Canary Islands drawn by William Dampier during his voyage to New Holland in 1699  The Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands consists of two provinces  Las Palmas and Santa Cruz de Tenerife  whose capitals  Las Palmas and Santa Cruz de Tenerife  are capitals of the autonomous community  Each of the seven major islands is ruled by an island council named cabildo insular  The international boundary of the Canaries is the subject of dispute between Spain and Morocco  Morocco does not agree that the laws regarding territorial limits allow Spain to claim for itself seabed boundaries based on the territory of the Canaries  because the Canary Islands are autonomous  In fact  the islands do not enjoy any special degree of autonomy as each one of the Spanish regions is considered an autonomous community  Under the Law of the Sea  the only islands not granted territorial waters or an Exclusive Economic Zone  EEZ  are those that are not fit for human habitation or do not have an economic life of their own  which is clearly not the case of the Canary Islands  The boundary is relevant for possible seabed oil deposits and other ocean resource exploitation  Morocco therefore does not formally agree to the territorial boundary  it rejected a 2002 unilateral Spanish proposal  30  The Islands have 13 seats in the Spanish Senate  Of these  11 seats are directly elected  3 for Gran Canaria  3 for Tenerife  1 for each other island  2 seats are indirectly elected by the regional Autonomous Government  The local government is presided over by Paulino Rivero  the current President of the Canary Islands  31   edit  History  edit  Ancient and pre colonial times Main article  Canary Islands in pre colonial times Guanche mummy in the Museo de la Naturaleza y el Hombre  Tenerife   Before the arrival of the aborigines  the Canaries were inhabited by prehistoric animals  for example  the giant lizard  Gallotia goliath   or giant rats  Canariomys bravoi and Canariomys tamarani   32  The islands were visited by the Phoenicians  the Greeks  and the Carthaginians  According to the 1st century AD Roman author and philosopher Pliny the Elder  the archipelago was found to be uninhabited when visited by the Carthaginians under Hanno the Navigator  but that they saw ruins of great buildings  33  This story may suggest that the islands were inhabited by other peoples prior to the Guanches  King Juba  Augustus s Numidian protege  is credited with discovering the islands for the Western world  He dispatched a naval contingent to re open the dye production facility at Mogador in what is now western Morocco in the early 1st century AD  34  That same naval force was subsequently sent on an exploration of the Canary Islands  using Mogador as their mission base  When the Europeans began to explore the islands  they encountered several indigenous populations living at a Neolithic level of technology  Although the history of the settlement of the Canary Islands is still unclear  linguistic and genetic analyses seem to indicate that at least some of these inhabitants shared a common origin with the Berbers of northern Africa  35  The pre colonial inhabitants came to be known collectively as the Guanches  although Guanches was originally the name for the indigenous inhabitants of Tenerife  During the Middle Ages  the islands were visited by the Arabs for commercial purposes  The Muslim navigator Ibn Farrukh  from Granada  is said to have landed in  Gando   Gran Canaria  in February 999  visiting a king named Guanarigato  citation needed  From the 14th century onward  numerous visits were made by sailors from Majorca  Portugal and Genoa  Lancelotto Malocello settled on Lanzarote in 1312  The Majorcans established a mission with a bishop in the islands that lasted from 1350 to 1400  Alonso Fern ndez de Lugo presenting the captured native kings of Tenerife to Ferdinand and Isabella  edit  Castilian conquest Main articles  Conquest of the Canary Islands and Kingdom of the Canary Islands There may have been a Portuguese expedition that attempted to colonize the islands as early as 1336  but there is not enough hard evidence to support this  In 1402  the Castilian conquest of the islands began  with the expedition of French explorers Jean de B thencourt and Gadifer de la Salle  nobles and vassals of Henry III of Castile  to Lanzarote  From there  they conquered Fuerteventura  1405  and El Hierro  B thencourt received the title King of the Canary Islands  but still recognized King Henry III as his overlord  B thencourt also established a base on the island of La Gomera  but it would be many years before the island was truly conquered  The natives of La Gomera  and of Gran Canaria  Tenerife  and La Palma  resisted the Castilian invaders for almost a century  In 1448 Maciot de B thencourt sold the lordship of Lanzarote to Portugal s Prince Henry the Navigator  an action that was not accepted by the natives nor by the Castilians  Despite Pope Nicholas V ruling that the Canary Islands were under Portuguese control  a crisis swelled to a revolt which lasted until 1459 with the final expulsion of the Portuguese  In 1479  Portugal and Castile signed the Treaty of Alc  ovas  The treaty settled disputes between Castile and Portugal over the control of the Atlantic  in which Castilian control of the Canary Islands was recognized but which also confirmed Portuguese possession of the Azores  Madeira  the Cape Verde islands and gave them rights to lands discovered and to be discovered   and any other island which might be found and conquered from the Canary islands beyond toward Guinea  The Castilians continued to dominate the islands  but due to the topography and the resistance of the native Guanches  complete pacification was not achieved until 1495  when Tenerife and La Palma were finally subdued by Alonso Fern ndez de Lugo  After that  the Canaries were incorporated into the Kingdom of Castile   edit  After the conquest After the conquest  the Castilians imposed a new economic model  based on single crop cultivation  first sugar cane  then wine  an important item of trade with England  In this era  the first institutions of colonial government were founded  Both Gran Canaria  a colony of Castile since March 6  1480  from 1556  of Spain   and Tenerife  a Spanish colony since 1495  had separate governors  The cities of Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas became a stopping point for the Spanish conquerors  traders  and missionaries on their way to the New World  This trade route brought great prosperity to some of the social sectors of the islands  The islands became quite wealthy and soon were attracting merchants and adventurers from all over Europe  Magnificent palaces and churches were built on La Palma during this busy  prosperous period  The Church of El Salvador survives as one of the island s finest examples of the architecture of the 16th century  The Canaries  wealth invited attacks by pirates and privateers  Ottoman Turkish admiral and privateer Kemal Reis ventured into the Canaries in 1501  while Murat Reis the Elder captured Lanzarote in 1585  Church of San Juan Bautista  Arucas in Gran Canaria  The most severe attack took place in 1599  during the Dutch War of Independence  A Dutch fleet of 74 ships and 12 000 men  commanded by Johan van der Does  attacked the capital  Las Palmas  the city had 3 500 of Gran Canaria s 8 545 inhabitants   The Dutch attacked the Castillo de la Luz  which guarded the harbor  The Canarians evacuated civilians from the city  and the Castillo surrendered  but not the city   The Dutch moved inland  but Canarian cavalry drove them back to Tamaraceite  near the city  The Dutch then laid siege to the city  demanding the surrender of all its wealth  They received 12 sheep and 3 calves  Furious  the Dutch sent 4 000 soldiers to attack the Council of the Canaries  who were sheltering in the village of Santa Br gida  300 Canarian soldiers ambushed the Dutch in the village of Monte Lentiscal  killing 150 and forcing the rest to retreat  The Dutch concentrated on Las Palmas  attempting to burn it down  The Dutch pillaged Maspalomas  on the southern coast of Gran Canaria  San Sebastian on La Gomera  and Santa Cruz on La Palma  but eventually gave up the siege of Las Palmas and withdrew  Another noteworthy attack occurred in 1797  when Santa Cruz de Tenerife was attacked by a British fleet under the future Lord Nelson on 25 July  The British were repulsed  losing almost 400 men  It was during this battle that Nelson lost his right arm   edit  18th to 19th century Bus Station at San Telmo Park  Las Palmas  The sugar based economy of the islands faced stiff competition from Spain s American colonies  Crises in the sugar market in the 19th century caused severe recessions on the islands  A new cash crop  cochineal  cochinilla   came into cultivation during this time  saving the islands  economy  By the end of the 18th century  Canary Islanders had already emigrated to Spanish American territories  such as Havana  Veracruz  Santo Domingo  36 San Antonio  Texas 37  and St  Bernard Parish  Louisiana  38  39  These economic difficulties spurred mass emigration  primarily to the Americas  during the 19th and first half of the 20th century  Between 1840 and 1890 as many as 40 000 Canary Islanders emigrated to Venezuela  Also  thousands of Canarians moved to Puerto Rico where the Spanish monarchy felt that Canarians would adapt to island life better than other immigrants from the mainland of Spain  Deeply entrenched traditions  such as the Mascaras Festival in the town of Hatillo  Puerto Rico  are an example of Canarian culture still preserved in Puerto Rico  Similarly  many thousands of Canarians emigrated to the shores of Cuba  40  During the Spanish American War of 1898  the Spanish fortified the islands against possible American attack  but an attack never came   edit  Romantic period and scientific expeditions Coast El Golfo  El Hierro Sirera and Renn  2004  41  distinguish two different types of expeditions  or voyages  during the period 1770 1830  which they term  the Romantic period   First are  expeditions financed by the States  closely related with the official scientific Institutions  characterized by having strict scientific objectives  and inspired by  the spirit of Illustration and progress   In this type of expedition  Sirera and Renn include the following travelers  J  Edens  whose 1715 ascent and observations of Mt  Teide influenced many subsequent expeditions  Louis Feuill e  1724   who was sent to measure the meridian of El Hierro and to map the islands  Jean Charles de Borda  1771  1776  who more accurately measured the longitudes of the islands and the height of Mount Teide the Baudin Ledru expedition  1796  which aimed to recover a valuable collection of natural history objects  The second type of expedition identified by Sirera and Renn is one that took place starting from more or less private initiatives  Among these  the key exponents were the following  Alexander von Humboldt  1799  von Buch Smith Broussonet Webb Bertholet  Sirera and Renn identify the period 1770 1830 as one in which  In a panorama dominated until that moment by France and England enters with strength and brio Germany of the Romantic period whose presence in the islands will increase    edit  Early 20th century Casa de Col n y Pilar Nuevo  Gran Canaria  At the beginning of the 20th century  the British introduced a new cash crop  the banana  the export of which was controlled by companies such as Fyffes  The rivalry between the elites of the cities of Las Palmas and Santa Cruz for the capital of the islands led to the division of the archipelago into two provinces in 1927  This has not laid to rest the rivalry between the two cities  which continues to this day  During the time of the Second Spanish Republic  Marxist and anarchist workers  movements began to develop  led by figures such as Jose Miguel Perez and Guillermo Ascanio  However  outside of a few municipalities  these organizations were a minority and fell easily to Nationalist forces during the Spanish Civil War   edit  Franco regime In 1936  Francisco Franco was appointed General Commandant of the Canaries  He joined the military revolt of July 17 which began the Spanish Civil War  Franco quickly took control of the archipelago  except for a few points of resistance on La Palma and in the town of Vallehermoso  on La Gomera  Though there was never a proper war in the islands  the post war repression on the Canaries was most severe  citation needed  During the Second World War  Winston Churchill prepared plans for the British seizure of the Canary Islands as a naval base  in the event of Gibraltar being invaded from the Spanish mainland  Opposition to Franco s regime did not begin to organize until the late 1950s  which experienced an upheaval of parties such as the Communist Party of Spain and the formation of various nationalist  leftist parties   edit  Self governance Auditorio de Tenerife by Santiago Calatrava  and an icon of contemporary architecture in the Canary Islands 42   Santa Cruz de Tenerife   After the death of

loggerhead sea turtle  66  The other four are the green sea turtle  hawksbill sea turtle  leatherback sea turtle and Kemp s ridley sea turtle  Currently  there are no signs that any of these species breed in the islands  and so those seen in the water are usually migrating  However  it is believed that some of these species may have bred in the islands in the past  and there are records of several sightings of leatherback sea turtle on beaches in Fuerteventura  adding credibility to the theory  Marine mammals include the Short Finned Pilot Whale  Common and Bottlenose dolphins  The
