highlighted  The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic depression in the decade preceding World War II  The timing of the Great Depression varied across nations  but in most countries it started in about 1929 and lasted until the late 1930s or early 1940s  1  It was the longest  most widespread  and deepest depression of the 20th century  2  In the 21st century  the Great Depression is commonly used as an example of how far the world s economy can decline  2  The depression originated in the U S   starting with the fall in stock prices that began around September 4  1929 and became worldwide news with the stock market crash of October 29  1929  known as Black Tuesday   From there  it quickly spread to almost every country in the world  The Great Depression had devastating effects in virtually every country  rich and poor  Personal income  tax revenue  profits and prices dropped  while international trade plunged by more than 50   Unemployment in the U S  rose to 25   and in some countries rose as high as 33   3  Cities all around the world were hit hard  especially those dependent on heavy industry  Construction was virtually halted in many countries  Farming and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by approximately 60   4  5  6  Facing plummeting demand with few alternate sources of jobs  areas dependent on primary sector industries such as cash cropping  mining and logging suffered the most  7  Some economies started to recover by the mid 1930s  In many countries  the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the start of World War II  8

Depression See also  Timeline of the Great Depression The Dow Jones Industrial  1928 1930 Economic historians usually attribute the start of the Great Depression to the sudden devastating collapse of US stock market prices on October 29  1929  known as Black Tuesday  9  some dispute this conclusion  and see the stock crash as a symptom  rather than a cause  of the Great Depression  3  10  Even after the Wall Street Crash of 1929  optimism persisted for some time  John D  Rockefeller said that  These are days when many are discouraged  In the 93 years of my life  depressions have come and gone  Prosperity has always returned and will again   11  The stock market turned upward in early 1930  returning to early 1929 levels by April  This was still almost 30  below the peak of September 1929  12  Together  government and business spent more in the first half of 1930 than in the corresponding period of the previous year  On the other hand  consumers  many of whom had suffered severe losses in the stock market the previous year  cut back their expenditures by ten percent  Likewise  beginning in mid 1930  a severe drought ravaged the agricultural heartland of the USA  By mid 1930  interest rates had dropped to low levels  but expected deflation and the continuing reluctance of people to borrow meant that consumer spending and investment were depressed  13  By May 1930  automobile sales had declined to below the levels of 1928  Prices in general began to decline  although wages held steady in 1930  but then a deflationary spiral started in 1931  Conditions were worse in farming areas  where commodity prices plunged  and in mining and logging areas  where unemployment was high and there were few other jobs  The decline in the US economy was the factor that pulled down most other countries at first  then internal weaknesses or strengths in each country made conditions worse or better  Frantic attempts to shore up the economies of individual nations through protectionist policies  such as the 1930 U S  Smoot Hawley Tariff Act and retaliatory tariffs in other countries  exacerbated the collapse in global trade  By late 1930  a steady decline in the world economy had set in  which did not reach bottom until 1933  Economic indicators Change in economic indicators 1929 32 14  United States Great Britain France Germany Industrial production  46   23   24

of Wall Street and Broad Street after the 1929 crash  There were multiple causes for the first downturn in 1929  These include the structural weaknesses and specific events that turned it into a major depression and the manner in which the downturn spread from country to country  In relation to the 1929 downturn  historians emphasize structural factors like major bank failures and the stock market crash  In contrast  economists  such as Barry Eichengreen  Milton Friedman and Peter Temin  point to monetary factors such as actions by the US Federal Reserve that contracted the money supply  as well as Britain s decision to return to the Gold Standard at pre World War I parities  US 4 86  1   Recessions and business cycles are thought to be a normal part of living in a world of inexact balances between supply and demand  What turns a normal recession or  ordinary  business cycle into a depression is a subject of much debate and concern  Scholars have not agreed on the exact causes and their relative importance  The search for causes is closely connected to the issue of avoiding future depressions  Thus  the personal political and policy viewpoints of scholars greatly color their analysis of historic events occurring eight decades ago  citation needed  An even larger question is whether the Great Depression was primarily a failure on the part of free markets or a failure of government efforts to regulate interest rates  curtail widespread bank failures  and control the money supply  Those who believe in a larger economic role for the state believe that it was primarily a failure of free markets  while those who believe in a smaller role for the state believe that it was primarily a failure of government that compounded the problem  citation needed  Current theories may be broadly classified into two main points of view and several heterodox points of view  First  there are demand driven theories  most importantly Keynesian economics  but also including those who point to the breakdown of international trade  and Institutional economists who point to underconsumption and over investment  causing an economic bubble   malfeasance by bankers and industrialists  or incompetence by government officials  The consensus among demand driven theories is that a large scale loss of confidence led to a sudden reduction in consumption and investment spending  Once panic and deflation set in  many people believed they could avoid further losses by keeping clear of the markets  Holding money became profitable as prices dropped lower and a given amount of money bought ever more goods  exacerbating the drop in demand  Secondly  there are the monetarists  who believe that the Great Depression started as an ordinary recession  but that significant policy mistakes by monetary authorities  especially the Federal Reserve   caused a shrinking of the money supply which greatly exacerbated the economic situation  causing a recession to descend into the Great Depression  Related to this explanation are those who point to debt deflation causing those who borrow to owe ever more in real terms  Lastly  there are various heterodox theories that downplay or reject the explanations of the Keynesians and monetarists  For example  some new classical macroeconomists have argued that various labor market policies imposed at the start caused the length and severity of the Great Depression  The Austrian school of economics focuses on the macroeconomic effects of money supply  and how central banking decisions can lead to over investment  economic bubble   Demand driven US industrial production  1928 39  US Farm Prices   1928 35  Keynesian British economist John Maynard Keynes argued in General Theory of Employment Interest and Money that lower aggregate expenditures in the economy contributed to a massive decline in income and to employment that was well below the average  In such a situation  the economy reached equilibrium at low levels of economic activity and high unemployment  Keynes  basic idea was simple  to keep people fully employed  governments have to run deficits when the economy is slowing  as the private sector would not invest enough to keep production at the normal level and bring the economy out of recession  Keynesian economists called on governments during times of economic crisis to pick up the slack by increasing government spending and or cutting taxes  As the Depression wore on  Franklin D  Roosevelt tried public works  farm subsidies  and other devices to restart the US economy  but never completely gave up trying to balance the budget  According to the Keynesians  this improved the economy  but Roosevelt never spent enough to bring the economy out of recession until the start of World War II  15  Breakdown of international trade Many economists have argued that the sharp decline in international trade after 1930 helped to worsen the depression  especially for countries significantly dependent on foreign trade  Most historians and economists partly blame the American Smoot Hawley Tariff Act  enacted June 17  1930  for worsening the depression by seriously reducing international trade and causing retaliatory tariffs in other countries  While foreign trade was a small part of overall economic activity in the U S  and was concentrated in a few businesses like farming  it was a much larger factor in many other countries  16  The average ad valorem rate of duties on dutiable imports for 1921 1925 was 25 9  but under the new tariff it jumped to 50  in 1931 1935  In dollar terms  American exports declined from about  5 2 billion in 1929 to  1 7 billion in 1933  but prices also fell  so the physical volume of exports only fell by half  Hardest hit were farm commodities such as wheat  cotton  tobacco  and lumber  According to this theory  the collapse of farm exports caused many American farmers to default on their loans  leading to the bank runs on small rural banks that characterized the early years of the Great Depression  Debt deflation Irving Fisher argued that the predominant factor leading to the Great Depression was over indebtedness and deflation  Fisher tied loose credit to over indebtedness  which fueled speculation and asset bubbles  17  He then outlined 9 factors interacting with one another under conditions of debt and deflation to create the mechanics of boom to bust  The chain of events proceeded as follows  Debt liquidation and distress selling Contraction of the money supply as bank loans are paid off A fall in the level of asset prices A still greater fall in the net worths of business  precipitating bankruptcies A fall in profits A reduction in output  in trade and in employment  Pessimism and loss of confidence Hoarding of money A fall in nominal interest rates and a rise in deflation adjusted interest rates  17  Crowds outside the Bank of United States in New York after its failure in 1931  During the Crash of 1929 preceding the Great Depression  margin requirements were only 10   18  Brokerage firms  in other words  would lend  9 for every  1 an investor had deposited  When the market fell  brokers called in these loans  which could not be paid back  19  Banks began to fail as debtors defaulted on debt and depositors attempted to withdraw their deposits en masse  triggering multiple bank runs  Government guarantees and Federal Reserve banking regulations to prevent such panics were ineffective or not used  Bank failures led to the loss of billions of dollars in assets  19  Outstanding debts became heavier  because prices and incomes fell by 20 50  but the debts remained at the same dollar amount  After the panic of 1929  and during the first 10 months of 1930  744 US banks failed   In all  9 000 banks failed during the 1930s   By April 1933  around  7 billion in deposits had been frozen in failed banks or those left unlicensed after the March Bank Holiday  20  Bank failures snowballed as desperate bankers called in loans which the borrowers did not have time or money to repay  With future profits looking poor  capital investment and construction slowed or completely ceased  In the face of bad loans and worsening future prospects  the surviving banks became even more conservative in their lending  19  Banks built up their capital reserves and made fewer loans  which intensified deflationary pressures  A vicious cycle developed and the downward spiral accelerated  The liquidation of debt could not keep up with the fall of prices which it caused  The mass effect of the stampede to liquidate increased the value of each dollar owed  relative to the value of declining asset holdings  The very effort of individuals to lessen their burden of debt effectively increased it  Paradoxically  the more the debtors paid  the more they owed  17  This self aggravating process turned a 1930 recession into a 1933 great depression  Macroeconomists including Ben Bernanke  the current chairman of the U S  Federal Reserve Bank  have revived the debt deflation view of the Great Depression originated by Fisher  21  22  Monetarist Crowd at New York s American Union Bank during a bank run early in the Great Depression  Monetarists  including Milton Friedman and current Federal Reserve System chairman Ben Bernanke  argue that the Great Depression was mainly caused by monetary contraction  the consequence of poor policy making by the American Federal Reserve System and continued crisis in the banking system  23  24  In this view  the Federal Reserve  by not acting  allowed the money supply as measured by the M2 to shrink by one third from 1929 1933  thereby transforming a normal recession into the Great Depression  Friedman argued that the downward turn in the economy  starting with the stock market crash  would have been just another recession  25  The Federal Reserve allowed some large public bank failures   particularly that of the New York Bank of the United States   which produced panic and widespread runs on local banks  and the Federal Reserve sat idly by while banks collapsed  He claimed that  if the Fed had provided emergency lending to these key banks  or simply bought government bonds on the open market to provide liquidity and increase the quantity of money after the key banks fell  all the rest of the banks would not have fallen after the large ones did  and the money supply would not have fallen as far and as fast as it did  26  With significantly less money to go around  businessmen could not get new loans and could not even get their old loans renewed  forcing many to stop investing  This interpretation blames the Federal Reserve for inaction  especially the New York branch  27  One reason why the Federal Reserve did not act to limit the decline of the money supply was regulation  At that time  the amount of credit the Federal Reserve could issue was limited by the Federal Reserve Act  which required 40  gold backing of Federal Reserve Notes issued  By the late 1920s  the Federal Reserve had almost hit the limit of allowable credit that could be backed by the gold in its possession  This credit was in the form of Federal Reserve demand notes  28  A  promise of gold  is not as good as  gold in the hand   particularly when they only had enough gold to cover 40  of the Federal Reserve Notes outstanding  During the bank panics a portion of those demand notes were redeemed for Federal Reserve gold  Since the Federal Reserve had hit its limit on allowable credit  any reduction in gold in its vaults had to be accompanied by a greater reduction in credit  On April 5  1933  President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6102 making the private ownership of gold certificates  coins and bullion illegal  reducing the pressure on Federal Reserve gold  28  New classical approach Recent work from a neoclassical perspective focuses on the decline in productivity that caused the initial decline in output and a prolonged recovery due to policies that affected the labor market  This work  collected by Kehoe and Prescott  29  decomposes the economic decline into a decline in the labor force  capital stock  and the productivity with which these inputs are used  This study suggests that theories of the Great Depression have to explain an initial severe decline but rapid recovery in productivity  relatively little change in the capital stock  and a prolonged depression in the labor force  This analysis rejects theories that focus on the role of savings and posit a decline in the capital stock  Austrian School Another explanation comes from the Austrian School of economics  Theorists of the  Austrian School  who wrote about the Depression include Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek and American economist Murray Rothbard  who wrote America s Great Depression  1963   In their view and like the monetarists  the Federal Reserve  which was created in 1913  shoulders much of the blame  but in opposition to the monetarists  they argue that the key cause of the Depression was the expansion of the money supply in the 1920s that led to an unsustainable credit driven boom  30  In the Austrian view it was this inflation of the money supply that led to an unsustainable boom in both asset prices  stocks and bonds  and capital goods  By the time the Fed belatedly tightened in 1928  it was far too late and  in the Austrian view  a significant economic contraction was inevitable  According to the Austrians  the artificial interference in the economy was a disaster prior to the Depression  and government efforts to prop up the economy after the crash of 1929 only made things worse  30  According to Rothbard  government intervention delayed the market s adjustment and made the road to complete recovery more difficult  30  However  Hayek  unlike Rothbard  also believed  along with the monetarists  that the Federal Reserve further contributed to the problems of the Depression by permitting the money supply to shrink during the earliest years of the Depression  31  Marxist Karl Marx saw recession and depression as unavoidable under free market capitalism as there are no restrictions on accumulations of capital other than the market itself  In the Marxist view  capitalism tends to create unbalanced accumulations of wealth  leading to over accumulations of capital which inevitably lead to a crisis  This especially sharp bust is a regular feature of the boom and bust pattern of what Marxists term  chaotic  capitalist development  It is a tenet of many Marxists groupings that such crises are inevitable and will be increasingly severe until the contradictions inherent in the mismatch between the mode of production and the development of productive forces reach the final point of failure  At which point  the crisis period encourages intensified class conflict and forces societal change  32  Inequality Power farming displaces tenants from the land in the western dry cotton area  Childress County  Texas  1938  Two economists of the 1920s  Waddill Catchings and William Trufant Foster  popularized a theory that influenced many policy makers  including Herbert Hoover  Henry A  Wallace  Paul Douglas  and Marriner Eccles  It held the economy produced more than it consumed  because the consumers did not have enough income  Thus the unequal distribution of wealth throughout the 1920s caused the Great Depression  33  34  According to this view  the root cause of the Great Depression was a global over investment in heavy industry capacity compared to wages and earnings from independent businesses  such as farms  The solution was the government must pump money into consumers  pockets  That is  it must redistribute purchasing power  maintain the industrial base  but re inflate prices and wages to force as much of the inflationary increase in purchasing power into consumer spending  The economy was overbuilt  and new factories were not needed  Foster and Catchings recommended 35  federal and state governments start large construction projects  a program followed by Hoover and Roosevelt  Productivity shock  It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the  productivity  output and employment  trends we are describing are long time trends and were thoroughly evident prior to 1929  These trends are in nowise the result of the present depression  nor are they the result of the World War  On the contrary  the present depression is a collapse resulting from these long term trends    36  M  King Hubbert The first three decades of the 20th century saw economic output surge with electrification  mass production and motorized farm machinery  and because of the rapid growth in productivity there was a lot of excess production capacity and the work week was being reduced  The dramatic rise in productivity of major industries in the U  S  and the effects of productivity on output  wages and the work week are discussed by Spurgeon Bell in his book Productivity  Wages  and National Income  1940   37  Turning point and recovery The overall course of the Depression in the United States  as reflected in per capita GDP  average income per person  shown in constant year 2000 dollars  plus some of the key events of the period  38  In most countries of the world  recovery from the Great Depression began in 1933  9  In the U S   recovery began in early 1933  9  but the U S  did not return to 1929 GNP for over a decade and still had an unemployment rate of about 15  in 1940  albeit down from the high of 25  in 1933  The measurement of the unemployment rate in this time period was unsophisticated and complicated by the presence of massive underemployment  in which employers and workers engaged in rationing of jobs  citation needed  There is no consensus among economists regarding the motive force for the U S  economic expansion that continued through most of the Roosevelt years  and the 1937 recession that interrupted it   Roosevelt s ebullient public personality  conveyed through his declaration that  the only thing we have to fear is fear itself  and his  fireside chats  on the radio did a great deal to help restore the nation s confidence  Fireside Chat 1 On the Banking Crisis Roosevelt s first Fireside Chat on the Banking Crisis  March 12  1933  Problems listening to this file  See media help  The common view among mainstream economists is that Roosevelt s New Deal policies either caused or accelerated the recovery  although his policies were never aggressive enough to bring the economy completely out of recession  Some economists have also called attention to the positive effects from expectations of reflation and rising nominal interest rates that Roosevelt s words and actions portended  39  40  It was the rollback of those same reflationary policies that led to the interrupting recession of 1937  41  One contributing policy that reversed reflation was the Banking Act of 1935  which effectively raised reserve requirements  causing a monetary contraction that helped to thwart the recovery  42  GDP returned to its upward slope in 1938  According to Christina Romer  the money supply growth caused by huge international gold inflows was a crucial source of the recovery of the United States economy  and that the economy showed little sign of self correction  The gold inflows were partly due to devaluation of the U S  dollar and partly due to deterioration of the political situation in Europe  43  In their book  A Monetary History of the United States  Milton Friedman and Anna J  Schwartz also attributed the recovery to monetary factors  and contended that it was much slowed by poor management of money by the Federal Reserve System  Current Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke agrees that monetary factors played important roles both in the worldwide economic decline and eventual recovery  44  Bernanke  also sees a strong role for institutional factors  particularly the rebuilding and restructuring of the financial system  45  and points out that the Depression needs to be examined in international perspective  46  Gold standard The Depression in international perspective  47  Economic studies have indicated that just as the downturn was spread worldwide by the rigidities of the Gold Standard  it was suspending gold convertibility  or devaluing the currency in gold terms  that did most to make recovery possible  48  49  50  What policies countries followed after casting off the gold standard  and what results followed varied widely  Every major currency left the gold standard during the Great Depression  Great Britain was the first to do so  Facing speculative attacks on the pound and depleting gold reserves  in September 1931 the Bank of England ceased exchanging pound notes for gold and the pound was floated on foreign exchange markets  Great Britain  Japan  and the Scandinavian countries left the gold standard in 1931  Other countries  such as Italy and the U S   remained on the gold standard into 1932 or 1933  while a few countries in the so called  gold bloc   led by France and including Poland  Belgium and Switzerland  stayed on the standard until 1935 1936  According to later analysis  the earliness with which a country left the gold standard reliably predicted its economic recovery  For example  Great Britain and Scandinavia  which left the gold standard in 1931  recovered much earlier than France and Belgium  which remained on gold much longer  Countries such as China  which had a silver standard  almost avoided the depression entirely  The connection between leaving the gold standard as a strong predictor of that country s severity of its depression and the length of time of its recovery has been shown to be consistent for dozens of countries  including developing countries  This partly explains why the experience and length of the depression differed between national economies  51  A female factory worker in 1942  Fort Worth  Texas  Women entered the workforce as men were drafted into the armed forces  World War II and recovery The common view among economic historians is that the Great Depression ended with the advent of World War II  Many economists believe that government spending on the war caused or at least accelerated recovery from the Great Depression  though some consider that it did not play a very large role in the recovery  It did help in reducing unemployment  9  52  53  The rearmament policies leading up to World War II helped stimulate the economies of Europe in 1937 39  By 1937  unemployment in Britain had fallen to 1 5 million  The mobilization of manpower following the outbreak of war in 1939 ended unemployment  54  America s entry into the war in 1941 finally eliminated the last effects from the Great Depression and brought the U S  unemployment rate down below 10   55  In the U S   massive war spending doubled economic growth rates  either masking the effects of the Depression or essentially ending the Depression  Businessmen ignored the mounting national debt and heavy new taxes  redoubling their efforts for greater output to take advantage of generous government contracts  Effects Unemployed men march in Toronto  Ontario  Canada During the Depression bankers became so unpopular that bank robbers  such as Bonnie and Clyde  became folk heroes  56  The majority of countries set up relief programs  and most underwent some sort of political upheaval  pushing them to the left or right  In some states  the desperate citizens turned toward nationalist demagoguery   the most infamous example being Adolf Hitler   setting the stage for World War II in 1939  Australia Main article  Great Depression in Australia Australia s extreme dependence on agricultural and industrial exports meant it was one of the hardest hit countries in the Western world  57  Falling export demand and commodity prices placed massive downward pressures on wages  Further  unemployment reached a record high of 29  in 1932  58  with incidents of civil unrest becoming common  After 1932  an increase in wool and meat prices led to a gradual recovery  Canada Main article  Great Depression in Canada Harshly affected by both the global economic downturn and the Dust Bowl  Canadian industrial production had fallen to only 58  of the 1929 level by 1932  the second lowest level in the world after the United States  and well behind nations such as Britain  which saw it fall only to 83  of the 1929 level  Total national income fell to 56  of the 1929 level  again worse than any nation apart from the United States  Unemployment reached 27  at the depth of the Depression in 1933  59  During the 1930s  Canada employed a highly restrictive immigration policy  60  Chile See also  Economic history of Chile The League of Nations labeled Chile the country hardest hit by the Great Depression because 80  of government revenue came from exports of copper and nitrates  which were in low demand  Chile initially felt the impact of the Great Depression in 1930  when GDP dropped 14   mining income declined 27   and export earnings fell 28   By 1932  GDP had shrunk to less than half of what it had been in 1929  exacting a terrible toll in unemployment and business failures  Influenced profoundly by the Great Depression  many national leaders promoted the development of local industry in an effort to insulate the economy from future external shocks  After six years of government austerity measures  which succeeded in reestablishing Chile s creditworthiness  Chileans elected to office during the 1938 58 period a succession of center and left of center governments interested in promoting economic growth by means of government intervention  Prompted in part by the devastating 1939 Chill n earthquake  the Popular Front government of Pedro Aguirre Cerda created the Production Development Corporation  Corporaci n de Fomento de la Producci n  CORFO  to encourage with subsidies and direct investments an ambitious program of import substitution industrialization  Consequently  as in other Latin American countries  protectionism became an entrenched aspect of the Chilean economy  France Main article  Great Depression in France The Depression began to affect France around 1931  61  France s relatively high degree of self sufficiency meant the damage was considerably less than in nations like Germany  Hardship and unemployment were high enough to lead to rioting and the rise of the socialist Popular Front  Ultra nationalist groups also saw increased popularity  although democracy prevailed into World War II  Germany Main article  Weimar Republic Adolf Hitler speaking in 1935 Germany s Weimar Republic was hit hard by the depression  as American loans to help rebuild the German economy now stopped  62  Unemployment soared  especially in larger cities  and the political system veered toward extremism  63  The unemployment rate reached nearly 30  in 1932  bolstering support for the anti capitalist Nazi  NSDAP  and Communist  KPD  parties  which both rose in the years following the crash to altogether possess a Reichstag majority following the general election in July 1932  64  Repayment of the war reparations due by Germany were suspended in 1932 following the Lausanne Conference of 1932  By that time  Germany had repaid one eighth of the reparations  Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power in January 1933  establishing a totalitarian single party state within months and initiating the path towards World War II  the most devastating conflict in world history  Japan The Great Depression did not strongly affect Japan  The Japanese economy shrank by 8  during 1929 31  Japan s Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo was the first to implement what have come to be identified as Keynesian economic policies  first  by large fiscal stimulus involving deficit spending  and second  by devaluing the currency  Takahashi used the Bank of Japan to sterilize the deficit spending and minimize resulting inflationary pressures  Econometric studies have identified the fiscal stimulus as especially effective  65  The devaluation of the currency had an immediate effect  Japanese textiles began to displace British textiles in export markets  The deficit spending proved to be most profound  The deficit spending went into the purchase of munitions for the armed forces  By 1933  Japan was already out of the depression  By 1934  Takahashi realized that the economy was in danger of overheating  and to avoid inflation  moved to reduce the deficit spending that went towards armaments and munitions  This resulted in a strong and swift negative reaction from nationalists  especially those in the army  culminating in his assassination in the course of the February 26 Incident  This had a chilling effect on all civilian bureaucrats in the Japanese government  From 1934  the military s dominance of the government continued to grow  Instead of reducing deficit spending  the government introduced price controls and rationing schemes that reduced  but did not eliminate inflation  which would remain a problem until the end of World War II  Family during the Great Depression  California  1936 The deficit spending had a transformative effect on Japan  Japan s industrial production doubled during the 1930s  Further  in 1929 the list of the largest firms in Japan was dominated by light industries  especially textile companies  many of Japan s automakers  like Toyota  have their roots in the textile industry   By 1940 light industry had been displaced by heavy industry as the largest firms inside the Japanese economy  66  Latin America Main article  Great Depression in Latin America Because of high levels of U S  investment in Latin American economies  they were severely damaged by the Depression  Within the region  Chile  Bolivia and Peru were particularly badly affected  Netherlands Main article  Great Depression in the Netherlands From roughly 1931 1937  the Netherlands suffered a deep and exceptionally long depression  This depression was partly caused by the after effects of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 in the U S   and partly by internal factors in the Netherlands  Government policy  especially the very late dropping of the Gold Standard  played a role in prolonging the depression  The Great Depression in the Netherlands led to some political instability and riots  and can be linked to the rise of the Dutch national socialist party NSB  The depression in the Netherlands eased off somewhat at the end of 1936  when the government finally dropped the Gold Standard  but real economic stability did not return until after World War II  67  Buried machinery in a barn lot  South Dakota  May 1936  The Dust Bowl on the Great Plains coincided with the Great Depression  68  Portugal Main article  Economy of Portugal Already under the rule of a dictatorial junta  the Ditadura Nacional  Portugal suffered no turbulent political effects of the Depression  although Antonio de Oliveira Salazar  already appointed Minister of Finance in 1928 greatly expanded his powers and in 1932 rose to Prime Minister of Portugal to found the Estado Novo  an authoritarian corporatist dictatorship  With the budget balanced in 1929  the effects of the depression were relaxed through harsh measures towards budget balance and autarchy  causing social discontent but stability and  eventually  an impressive economic growth  The regime outlived Salazar himself before overthrown in the Carnation Revolution in 1974  initiating a road towards the restoration of democracy  South Africa Main article  Great Depression in South Africa As world trade slumped  demand for South African agricultural and mineral exports fell drastically  The Carnegie Commission on Poor Whites had concluded in 1931 that nearly one third of Afrikaners lived as paupers  It is believed that the social discomfort caused by the depression was a contributing factor in the 1933 split between the  gesuiwerde   purified  and  smelter   fusionist  factions within the National Party and the National Party s subsequent fusion with the South African Party  69  Eventually  the gesuiwerde faction of Daniel Malan would go on to form its own party and take over the government after the 1948 election  bringing about the doctrine of apartheid  instituting and extending racial segregation  which would see an end only in 1994  Soviet Union Many Western intellectuals looked upon Soviet Union with sympathy  Jennifer Burns wrote   As the Great Depression ground on and unemployment soared  intellectuals began unfavorably comparing their faltering capitalist economy to Russian Communism      More than ten years after the Revolution  Communism was finally reaching full flower  according to the New York Times reporter Walter Duranty  a Stalin fan who vigorously debunked accounts of the Ukraine famine  a man made disaster that would leave millions dead   70  Spain Main article  Economy of Spain Greatly due to impopular economic policies  Prime Minister Jose Primo de Rivera resigned in 1930  followed by the ousting of King Alfonso XIII in the following year  A fragile democracy was established  torn at by economic problems and social discontent  culminating in the divisive general election of 1936 and the subsequent Spanish Civil War  culminating in an authoritarian regime under general Francisco Franco which was gradually disestablished following his death in 1975  with the first elections since Depression held in 1977  Sweden Main article  Economy of Sweden Taking place in the midst of a short lived government and a less than a decade old Swedish democracy  events such as those surrounding Ivar Kreuger  who eventually committed suicide  remain infamous in Swedish history  Eventually  the Social Democrats under Per Albin Hansson would form their first long lived government in 1932 based on strong interventionist and welfare state policies  monopolizing the office of Prime Minister until 1976 with the sole and short lived exception of Axel Pehrsson Bramstorp s  summer cabinet  in 1936  During forty years of hegemony  it was the most successful political party in the history of Western liberal democracy  71  Thailand In Thailand  then known as the kingdom of Siam  the Great Depression contributed to the end of the absolute monarchy of King Rama VII in the Siamese revolution of 1932  Unemployed men hop train  Canada  c 1933 United Kingdom Main article  Great Depression in the United Kingdom The effects on the northern industrial areas of Britain were immediate and devastating  as demand for traditional industrial products collapsed  By the end of 1930 unemployment had more than doubled from 1 million to 2 5 million  20  of the insured workforce   and exports had fallen in value by 50   In 1933  30  of Glaswegians were unemployed due to the severe decline in heavy industry  In some towns and cities in the north east  unemployment reached as high as 70  as shipbuilding fell 90   72  The National Hunger March of September October 1932 was the largest 73  of a series of hunger marches in Britain in the 1920s and 1930s  About 200 000 unemployed men were sent to the work camps  which continued in operation until 1939  74  In the less industrial Midlands and South of England  the effects were short lived and the later 1930s were a prosperous time  Growth in modern manufacture of electrical goods and a boom in the motor car industry was helped by a growing southern population and an expanding middle class  Agriculture also saw a boom during this period  75  See also  North South divide  England  United States Main articles  Great Depression in the United States and New Deal Shacks  put up by the Bonus Army  World War I

by horses  were used by farmers too impoverished to purchase gasoline  President Herbert Hoover started numerous programs  all of which failed to reverse the downturn  77  In June 1930 Congress approved the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act which raised tariffs on thousands of imported items  The intent of the Act was to encourage the purchase of American made products by increasing the cost of imported goods  while raising revenue for the federal government and protecting farmers  Other nations increased tariffs on American made goods in retaliation  reducing international trade  and worsening the Depression  78  In 1931 Hoover urged the major banks in the country to form a consortium known as the National Credit Corporation  NCC   79  By 1932  unemployment had reached 23 6   and it peaked in early 1933 at 25   80  drought persisted in the agricultural heartland  businesses and families defaulted on record numbers of loans  81  and more than 5 000 banks had failed  82  Hundreds of thousands of Americans found themselves homeless  and began congregating in shanty towns   dubbed  Hoovervilles    that began to appear across the country  83  In response  President Hoover and Congress approved the Federal Home Loan Bank Act  to spur new home construction  and reduce foreclosures  The final attempt of the Hoover Administration to stimulate the economy was the passage of the Emergency Relief and Construction Act  ERA  which included funds for public works programs such as dams and the creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation  RFC  in 1932  The RFC s initial goal was to provide government secured loans to financial institutions  railroads and farmers  Quarter by quarter the economy went downhill  as prices  profits and employment fell  leading to the political realignment in 1932 that brought to power Franklin Delano Roosevelt  Unemployed men queued outside a depression soup kitchen opened in Chicago by Al Capone  1931 The storefront sign reads  Free Soup  Coffee and Doughnuts for the Unemployed   Shortly after President Roosevelt was inaugurated in 1933  drought and erosion combined to cause the Dust Bowl  shifting hundreds of thousands of displaced persons off their farms in the Midwest  From his inauguration onward  Roosevelt argued that restructuring of the economy would be needed to prevent another depression or avoid prolonging the current one  New Deal programs sought to stimulate demand and provide work and relief for the impoverished through increased government spending and the institution of financial reforms  The Securities Act of 1933 comprehensively regulated the securities industry  This was followed by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which created the Securities and Exchange Commission  Though amended  key provisions of both Acts are still in force  Federal insurance of bank deposits was provided by the FDIC  and the Glass Steagall Act  The institution of the National Recovery Administration  NRA  remains a controversial act to this day  The NRA made a number of sweeping changes to the American economy until it was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1935  CCC workers constructing road  1933  Over 3 million unemployed young men were taken out of the cities and placed into 2600  work camps managed by the CCC  84  Early changes by the Roosevelt administration included  Instituting regulations to fight deflationary  cut throat competition  through the NRA  Setting minimum prices and wages  labor standards  and competitive conditions in all industries through the NRA  Encouraging unions that would raise wages  to increase the purchasing power of the working class  Cutting farm production to raise prices through the Agricultural Adjustment Act and its successors  Forcing businesses to work with government to set price codes through the NRA  These reforms  together with several other relief and recovery measures  are called the First New Deal  Economic stimulus was attempted through a new alphabet soup of agencies set up in 1933 and 1934 and previously extant agencies such as the Reconstruction Finance Corporation  By 1935  the  Second New Deal  added Social Security  which did not start making large payouts until much later   a jobs program for the unemployed  the Works Progress Administration  WPA  and  through the National Labor Relations Board  a strong stimulus to the growth of labor unions  In 1929  federal expenditures constituted only 3  of the GDP  The national debt as a proportion of GNP rose under Hoover from 20  to 40   Roosevelt kept it at 40  until the war began  when it soared to 128   WPA employed 2 3 million unemployed at unskilled labor  By 1936  the main economic indicators had regained the levels of the late 1920s  except for unemployment  which remained high at 11   although this was considerably lower than the 25  unemployment rate seen in 1933  In the spring of 1937  American industrial production exceeded that of 1929 and remained level until June 1937  In June 1937  the Roosevelt administration cut spending and increased taxation in an attempt to balance the federal budget  85  The American economy then took a sharp downturn  lasting for 13 months through most of 1938  Industrial production fell almost 30 per cent within a few months and production of durable goods fell even faster  Unemployment jumped from 14 3  in 1937 to 19 0  in 1938  rising from 5 million to more than 12 million in early 1938  86  Manufacturing output fell by 37  from the 1937 peak and was back to 1934 levels  87  Producers reduced their expenditures on durable goods  and inventories declined  but personal income was only 15  lower than it had been at the peak in 1937  As unemployment rose  consumers  expenditures declined  leading to further cutbacks in production  By May 1938 retail sales began to increase  employment improved  and industrial production turned up after June 1938  88  After the recovery from the Recession of 1937 1938  conservatives were able to form a bipartisan conservative coalition to stop further expansion of the New Deal and  when unemployment dropped to 2  in the early 1940s  they abolished WPA  CCC and the PWA relief programs  Social Security remained in place  Political consequences The crisis had many political consequences  among which was the abandonment of classic economic liberal approaches  which Roosevelt replaced in the U S  with Keynesian policies  These policies magnified the role of the federal government in the national economy  Between 1933 and 1939  federal expenditure tripled  and Roosevelt s critics charged that he was turning America into a socialist state  89  The Great Depression was a main factor in the implementation of social democracy and planned economies in European countries after World War II  see Marshall Plan   Although Austrian economists had challenged Keynesianism since the 1920s  it was not until the 1970s  with the influence of Milton Friedman that the Keynesian approach was politically questioned  90  Literature And the great owners  who must lose their land in an upheaval

Grapes of Wrath  91  The Great Depression has been the subject of much writing  as authors have sought to evaluate an era that caused financial as well as emotional trauma  Perhaps the most noteworthy and famous novel written on the subject is The Grapes of Wrath  published in 1939 and written by John Steinbeck  who was awarded both the Nobel Prize for literature and the Pulitzer Prize for the work  The novel focuses on a poor family of sharecroppers who are forced from their home as drought  economic hardship  and changes in the agricultural industry occur during the Great Depression  Steinbeck s Of Mice and Men is another important novel about a journey during the Great Depression  Additionally  Harper Lee s To Kill a Mockingbird is set during the Great Depression  Margaret Atwood s Booker prize winning The Blind Assassin is likewise set in the Great Depression  centering on a privileged socialite s love affair with a Marxist revolutionary  The era spurred the resurgence of social realism  practiced by many who started their writing careers on relief programs  especially the Federal Writers  Project in the U S  92  93  94  95  Naming Further information  Depression  economics  The term  The Great Depression  is most frequently attributed to British economist Lionel Robbins  whose 1934 book The Great Depression is credited with formalizing the phrase  96  though Hoover is widely credited with popularizing the term  96  97  informally referring to the downturn as a depression  with such uses as  Economic depression cannot be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement    December 1930  Message to Congress  and  I need not recount to you that the world is passing through a great depression    1931   The term  depression  to refer to an economic downturn dates to the 19th century  when it was used by varied Americans and British politicians and economists  Indeed  the first major American economic crisis  the Panic of 1819  was described by then president James Monroe as  a depression   96  and the most recent economic crisis  the Depression of 1920 21  had been referred to as a  depression  by then president Calvin Coolidge  Financial crises were traditionally referred to as  panics   most recently the major Panic of 1907  and the minor Panic of 1910 1911  though the 1929 crisis was called  The Crash   and the term  panic  has since fallen out of use  At the time of the Great Depression  the term  The Great Depression  was already used to referred to the period 1873 96  in the United Kingdom   or more narrowly 1873 79  in the United States   which has retroactively been renamed the Long Depression  Other  great depressions  Other economic downturns have been called a  great depression   but none had been as widespread  or lasted for so long  Various nations have experienced brief or extended periods of economic downturns  which were referred to as  depressions   but none have had such a widespread global impact  British economic historians used the term  great depression  to describe British conditions in the late 19th century  especially in agriculture  1873 1896  a period now referred to as the Long Depression  98  The fall of communism in the Soviet Union led to a severe economic crisis and catastrophic fall in the standards of living in the 1990s in the former Eastern Bloc  most notably  in post Soviet states  99  that was almost twice as intense as the Great Depression had been in the countries of Western Europe and the U S  in the 1930s  100  101  Even before Russia s financial crisis of 1998  Russia s GDP was half of what it had been in the early 1990s  101  and some populations are still poorer as of 2009 update  than they were in 1989  including Ukraine  Moldova  Serbia  Central Asia  and the Caucasus  Some journalists and economists have taken to calling the late 2000s recession the  Great Recession  in allusion to the Great Depression  102  103  104  105  Comparison with the late 2000s recession Main article  Comparisons between the late 2000s recession and the Great Depression Unlike the late 2000s recession  this recession was not synchronized by the global integration of markets  The recovery of the world s financial systems tended to be quicker during the Great Depression of the 1930s as opposed to the late 2000s recession  Half the unemployed have been out of work for over six months  something that wasn t repeated until the late 2000s recession  All link that connect the rising inequality within Western economies along with the deflating demand may exist in both recessions  1928 and 1929 were the times in the 20th century that the wealth gap reached such skewed extremes  106  2007 and 2008 eventually saw the world reach new levels of wealth gap inequality that rivalled the years of 1928 and 1929  See also Book  Great Depression Wikipedia books are collections of articles that can be downloaded or ordered in print  Aftermath of
