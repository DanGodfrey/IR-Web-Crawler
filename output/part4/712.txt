office  76 408 097 3  Fantasia is a 1940 American animated film produced by Walt Disney and released by Walt Disney Productions  With story direction by Joe Grant and Dick Huemer  and production supervision by Ben Sharpsteen  it is the third feature in the Disney animated features canon  The film consists of eight animated segments set to pieces of classical music conducted by Leopold Stokowski  seven of which are performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra  Music critic and composer Deems Taylor acts as the film s Master of Ceremonies  who introduces each segment in live action interstitial scenes  Disney settled on the film s concept as work neared completion on The Sorcerer s Apprentice  an elaborate Silly Symphonies short designed as a comeback role for Mickey Mouse who had declined in popularity  As production costs grew higher than what it could earn  he decided to include the short in a feature length film with other segments set to classical pieces  The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with Fantasound  a pioneering sound reproduction system that made Fantasia the first commercial film shown in stereophonic sound  Fantasia was first released in theatrical roadshow engagements held in thirteen U S  cities from November 13  1940  It received mixed critical reaction  and was unable to make a profit  In part this was due to World War II cutting off the profitable European market  but due as well to the film s high production costs and the expense of leasing theatres and installing the Fantasound equipment for the roadshow presentations  Also  audiences who felt that Disney had suddenly gone  highbrow  stayed away  preferring the standard Disney cartoons  The film was subsequently reissued multiple times with its original footage and audio being deleted  modified  or restored in each version  As of 2012  Fantasia has grossed  76 4 million in domestic revenue and is the 22nd highest grossing film of all time in the U S  when adjusted for inflation  4  Walt s nephew Roy E  Disney co produced a sequel released in 1999 titled Fantasia 2000  Contents 1 Program 2 Production 2 1 Origins 2 2 Development

Disney felt that the Disney studio s star character Mickey Mouse needed a boost in popularity  He decided to feature the mouse in The Sorcerer s Apprentice  a deluxe cartoon short based on the poem written by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and set to the orchestral piece by Paul Dukas that was inspired by the original tale  13  The concept of matching animation to classical music was used as early as 1928 in Disney s cartoon series  the Silly Symphonies  but he wanted to go beyond the usual slapstick  and produce shorts where  sheer fantasy unfolds   action controlled by a musical pattern has great charm in the realm of unreality   14  15  Upon receiving the rights to use the music by the end of July 1937  16  Disney considered using a well known conductor to record the music for added prestige  He happened to meet Leopold Stokowski  conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra since 1912  at Chasen s restaurant in Hollywood  and talked about his plans for the short  Stokowski recalled that he did  like the music   was happy to collaborate on the project  and offered to conduct the piece at no cost  17  Following their meeting  Disney s New York representative ran into Stokowski on a train headed for the East  In writing to Disney  he reported that Stokowski was  really serious in his offer to do the music for nothing  He had some very interesting ideas on instrumental coloring  which would be perfect for an animation medium   17  In his excited response dated October 26  1937  Disney wrote that he felt  all steamed up over the idea of Stokowski working with us   The union of Stokowski and his music  together with the best of our medium  would be the means of a success and should lead to a new style of motion picture presentation   18  He had already begun working on a story outline  and wished to use  the finest men   from color   down to animators  19  on the short  The Sorcerer s Apprentice was to be promoted as a  special  and rented to theatres as a unique film  outside of the Mickey Mouse cartoon series  17  20  An agreement signed by Disney and Stokowski on December 16  1937 allowed the conductor to  select and employ a complete symphony orchestra  for the recording  21  Disney hired a stage at the Culver Studios in California for the session  It began at midnight on January 9  1938  and lasted for three hours using eighty five Hollywood musicians  22  As production costs of The Sorcerer s Apprentice climbed to  125 000  it became clearer to Disney and his brother Roy  who managed the studio s finances  that the short could never earn such a sum back on its own  13  Roy wanted his brother to keep any additional costs on the film to a minimum  He said   because of its very experimental and unprecedented nature   we have no idea what can be expected from such a production   17 Ben Sharpsteen  a production supervisor on Fantasia  noted that its budget was three to four times greater than the usual Silly Symphony  but Disney  saw this trouble in the form of an opportunity  This was the birth of a new concept  a group of separate numbers regardless of their running time put together in a single presentation  It turned out to be a concert something novel and of high quality   23  Ideas to produce a complete feature film were pursued in February 1938  when enquiries were made to extend Stokowski s contract  23  In August  Disney asked Stokowski s representative to have him return to the studios to select material for the new film  which was initially titled The Concert Feature  17  The pair further thought of presenting the film with an on screen host to introduce each number in the program  Both had heard composer and music critic Deems Taylor provide intermission commentary during radio broadcasts of the New York Philharmonic  and agreed he would be most suitable for the role  18  Disney did contact Taylor about the project  but by then work on Pinocchio  Bambi  and development on his new Burbank studio kept him too busy to work on the new feature  24  In a change of plans  Taylor was asked during a call on September 3  1938 leave for the studios as soon as possible  He left New York City for Los Angeles by train two days later for a months visit  18  Development Taylor arrived at the studio one day after a series of meetings began to select the musical pieces for The Concert Feature  Disney made story writers Joe Grant and Dick Huemer gather a preliminary selection of music and along with Stokowski  Taylor  and the heads of various departments  discussed their ideas  23  Each meeting was recorded verbatim by stenographers with participants being given a copy of the entire conversation for review  As selections were considered  a recording of the piece was located and played back at the next gathering  25  Disney did not contribute much to early discussions  he admitted that his knowledge of music was instinctive and untrained  26  In one meeting  he inquired about a piece  on which we might build something of a prehistoric theme   with animals   27  The group was considering to use The Firebird by Igor Stravinsky  but Taylor noted that his  Le Sacre du printemps would be something on that order   to which Disney replied upon hearing a recording   This is marvelous  It would be perfect for prehistoric animals  There would be something terrific in dinosaurs  flying lizards  and prehistoric monsters  There could be beauty in the settings   28  Numerous choices were discarded as talks continued  including Moto Perpetuo by Niccol  Paganini with  shots of dynamos  cogs  pistons  and  whirling wheels  to show the prduction of a collar button  Other deletions were Prelude in G minor and Troika by Sergei Rachmaninoff  and a rendition of  The Song of the Flea  by Mussorgsky which was to be sung by Lawrence Tibbett  29  On September 29  1938  around sixty of Disney s artists gathered for a two and a half hour piano concert while he provided a running commentary about the new musical feature  A rough version of The Sorcerer s Apprentice was also shown that  according to one attendee  had the crowd applauding and cheering  until their hands were red   30  The final pieces were chosen the following morning  which included Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor  Cydalise et le Ch vre pied by Gabriel Piern   The Nutcracker Suite  Night on Bald Mountain  Ave Maria  Dance of the Hours  Clair de Lune by Claude Debussy  The Rite of Spring and The Sorcerer s Apprentice  30  Disney had already begun working out the details for the segments  and showed greater enthusiasm and eagerness as opposed to his anxiety while starting on Pinocchio  31  Clair de Lune was soon removed from the Fantasia program  but Disney and his writers encountered problems of setting a concrete story to Cydalise  Its opening march   The Entry of the Little Fauns   first attracted Disney to the piece which at first provided suitable depictions of fauns he wanted  On January 5  1939  following a search for a stronger piece to fit the mythological theme  the piece was replaced with sections of Beethoven s sixth symphony  32  Stokowski disagreed with the switch  believing that Disney s  idea of mythology   is not quite what this symphony is about   He was also concerned about the reception from classical music enthusiasts who would criticize Disney for venturing too far from the composer s intent  33  Taylor on the other hand welcomed the change  describing it as  a stunning one   and saw  no possible objection to it   34  The new feature continued to be known as The Concert Feature or Musical Feature as late as November 1938  Hal Horne  a publicist for Disney s film distributor RKO Radio Pictures  wished for a different title  and gave the suggestion Filmharmonic Concert  Stuart Buchanan then held a contest at the studio for a title that produced almost 1 800 suggestions including Bach to Stravinsky and Bach and Highbrowski by Stokowski  Still  the favorite among the film s supervisors was Fantasia  an early working title that had even grown on Horne   It isn t the word alone but the meaning we read into it   35  From the beginning of its development  Disney expressed the greater importance of music in Fantasia compared to his past work   In our ordinary stuff  our music is always under action  but on this   we re supposed to be picturing this music   not the music fitting our story   36  Disney had hoped that the film would bring classical music to people that  including himself  had  walked out on this kind of stuff   37  Design and animation Disney acting out a scene in The Sorcerer s Apprentice for Taylor and Stokowski  Animation on The Sorcerer s Apprentice began on January 21  1938 when James Algar  the director of the segment  assigned animator Preston Blair to work on the scene when Mickey Mouse wakes from his dream  38  Each of the seven hundred members of staff at the time received a synopsis of the Goethe tale  and were encouraged to complete a twenty question form that requested their ideas on what action might take place  16  22  Layout artist Tom Codrick created what Dick Huemer described as  brilliantly colored thumbnails  from preliminary storyboard sketches using gouache paints  which featured bolder use of color and lighting than any previous Disney short  39  Mickey was redesigned by animator Fred Moore who added pupils for the first time to achieve greater ranges of expression  16  40  Most of the segment was shot in live action  including a scene where a UCLA athlete was asked to run and jump across one of the studio s sound stages with barrels in the way  which was used for reference when Mickey traverses through water  41  Disney had been interested in producing abstract animation since he saw A Color Box by Len Lye from 1935  He explained the work done in the Toccata and Fugue was  no sudden idea   they were something we had nursed along several years but we never had a chance to try   42  Preliminary designs included those from effects animator Cy Young  who produced drawings influenced by the patterns on the edge of a piece of sound film  32  In late 1938 Disney hired Oskar Fischinger  a German artist who had produced numerous abstract animated films  including some with classical music  to work with Young  Upon review of three leica reels produced by the two  Disney rejected all three  According to Huemer all Fishinger  did was little triangles and designs   it didn t come off at all  Too dinky  Walt said   43  Fischinger  like Disney  was used to having full control over his work and was not used to working in a group  Feeling his designs were too abstract for a mass audience  13  Fishinger left the studio in apparent despair  before the segment was completed  in October 1939  44  Disney had plans to make the Toccata and Fugue an experimental three dimensional film  with audiences being given cardboard stereoscopic frames with their souvenir programs  but this idea was abandoned  42  In The Nutcracker Suite  animator Art Babbitt is said to have credited The Three Stooges as a guide for animating the dancing mushrooms in the Chinese Dance routine  He drew with a music score pinned to his desk to work out the choreography so he could relate the action to the melody and the counterpoint   those nasty little notes underneath   so something has to be related to that   45  The studio filmed professional dancers Joyce Coles and Marjorie Belcher wearing ballet skirts that resembled shapes of blossoms that were to sit above water for Dance of the Flutes  An Arabian dancer was also brought in to study the movements for the goldfish in Arab Dance  46  An early concept for The Rite of Spring was to extend the story to the age of mammals and the first humans and the discovery of fire and man s triumph  John Hubley  the segment s art director  explained that it was later curtailed by Disney to avoid controversy from creationists  who promised to make trouble should he connect evolution with humans  47  To gain a better understanding of the history of the planet the studio received guidance from Roy Chapman Andrews  the director of the American Museum of Natural History  English biologist Julian Huxley  paleontologist Barnum Brown  and astronomer Edwin Hubble  48  19  Animators studied comets and nebulae at the Mount Wilson Observatory  and observed a herd of iguanas and a baby alligator that were brought into the studio  49  The camera was kept at a low position throughout the segment to heighten the immensity of the dinosaurs  48  For inspiration on the routines in Dance of the Hours  animators studied real life ballet performers including Marge Champion and Irina Baronova  40  Animator John Hench was assigned to work on the segment  but resisted as he knew little about ballet  Disney then gave Hench season tickets to the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo with backstage access so he could learn more about it  50 B la Lugosi  best known for his role in Dracula  was brought in to provide reference poses for Chernabog  As animator Bill Tytla disliked the results  he used colleague Wilfred Jackson to pose shirtless which gave him the images he needed  13  There were ideas of releasing scents throughout the theater during Fantasia  including the smell of incense during Ave Maria  51  Over one thousand artists and technicians were used in the making of Fantasia  52  which features more than 500 characters  53  Segments were color keyed scene by scene so the colors in a single shot would harmonize between proceeding and following ones  54  Before a segment s narrative pattern was complete  an overall color scheme was designed to the general mood of the music  and patterned to correspond with the development of the subject matter  54  The studio s character model department would also sculpt three dimensional clay models so the animators could view their subject from all angles  38  Soundtrack Recording The Philadelphia Academy of Music  Disney wanted to experiment in more sophisticated sound recording and reproduction techniques for Fantasia   Music emerging from one speaker behind the screen sounds thin  tinkly and strainy  We wanted to reproduce such beautiful masterpieces   so that audiences would feel as though they were standing at the podium with Stokowski   55  For the recording of The Sorcerer s Apprentice in January 1938  22  engineers at Disney collaborated with RCA Corporation for using multiple audio channels which allowed any desired dynamic balance to be achieved upon playback  The stage was altered acoustically with double plywood semi circular partitions that separated the orchestra into five sections to increase reverberation  56  Though as the production of Fantasia developed  the setup used for The Sorcerer s Apprentice was abandoned for different multi channel recording arrangements  On January 18  1939  Stokowski signed an eighteen month contract with Disney to conduct the remaining pieces with the Philadelphia Orchestra  21  Recording began that April and lasted for seven weeks at the Academy of Music  the orchestra s home which was chosen for its excellent acoustics  55  57  In the recording sessions  thirty three microphones were placed around the orchestra that captured the music onto eight optical sound recording machines placed in the hall s basement  Each one represented an audio channel that focused on a different section of instruments  cellos and basses  violins  brass  violas  and woodwinds and tympani  The seventh channel was a combination of the first six while the eighth provided an overall sound of the orchestra at a distance  55  58  59  A ninth was later added to provide a click track function for the animators to time their drawings to the music  60  58  In the forty two days of recording 483 000 feet of film was used  55  Disney paid all the expenses which included the musician s wages  stage personnel  a music librarian  and the orchestra s manager that cost almost  18 000  21  When the finished recordings arrived at the studio  a meeting was held on July 14  1939 to allow the artists working on each segment to listen to Stokowski s arrangements  and suggest alterations in the sound to work more effectively with their designs  61  Fantasound The Disney brothers contacted David Sarnoff of RCA regarding the manufacture of a new system that would  create the illusion that the actual symphony orchestra is playing in the theater   Sarnoff backed out at first due to financial reasons  but agreed in July 1939 to make the equipment so long as the Disneys could hold down the estimated  200 000 in costs  62  Though it was not exactly known how to achieve their goal  engineers at Disney and RCA investigated many ideas and tests made with various equipment setups  56  The collaboration led to the development of Fantasound  a pioneering stereophonic surround sound system which innovated some processes widely used today  including simultaneous multi track recording  overdubbing  and noise reduction  58  Disney s chief sound engineer William Garity  Fantasound employed two projectors running at the same time  With one containing the picture film with a mono soundtrack for backup purposes  the other ran a sound film that was mixed from the eight tracks recorded at the Academy to four  Three of which contained the audio for the left  center  and right stage speakers respectively  while the fourth became a control track with amplitude and frequency tones that drove variable gain amplifiers to control the volume of the three audio tracks  56  In addition were three  house  speakers placed on the left  right  and center of the auditorium that derived from the left and right stage channels which acted as surround channels  58  As the original recording was captured at almost peak modulation to increase signal to noise ratio  the control track was used to restore the dynamics to where Stokowski thought they should be  For this  a tone operated gain adjusting device was built to control the levels of each of the three audio tracks through the amplifiers  The illusion of sound traveling across the speakers was achieved with a device named the  pan pot   which directed the predetermined movement of each audio channel with the control track  Mixing of the soundtrack required six people to operate the various pan pots in real time  while Stokowski directed each level and pan change which was marked on his musical score  To monitor the recording levels at lower frequencies  Disney ordered eight three color oscillators from the newly established Hewlett Packard company  63  a predecessor from VU meters used today  Between the individual takes  prints  and remakes  approximately three million feet of sound film was used in the production of Fantasia  55  Almost a fifth of the film s budget was spent on its recording techniques  64  Release history Theatrical runs 1940 1941 roadshows with Fantasound The Broadway Theatre RKO baulked at the idea of distributing what it described Fantasia as a  longhair musical   65  and believed its duration of two hours and five minutes was too long for a general release  66  67  It relaxed its exclusive distribution contract with Disney  who wanted a more prestigious exhibit in the form of a limited run roadshow attraction  A total of thirteen roadshows were held across the United States  each involving two daily screenings with seat reservations booked in advance at higher prices and a fifteen minute intermission  Disney hired film salesman Irving Ludwig to manage the first eleven engagements  68  who was given specific instructions regarding each aspect of the film s presentation  including the setup of outside theater marquees and curtain and lighting cues  Patrons were taken to their seats by staff hired and trained by Disney  69  and were given a program booklet illustrated by Gyo Fujikawa  70  The first roadshow opened at the Broadway Theatre in New York City on November 13  1940  70  The Disneys had secured a year s lease with the venue that was fully equipped with Fantasound  which took personnel a week working around the clock to install  71  Proceeds made on the night went to the British War Relief Society for the efforts in the Battle of Britain  72  Ticket demand was so great that eight telephone operators were employed to handle the extra calls while the adjoining store was rented out to cater the box office bookings  73 Fantasia ran at the Broadway for forty nine consecutive weeks  the longest run achieved by a film at the time  74  Its run continued for a total of fifty seven weeks until February 28  1942  75  The remaining twelve roadshows were held throughout 1941  which included a thirty nine week run 74  at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles from January 29  76  77 Fantasia broke the long run record at the venue in its twenty eighth week  a record previously held by Gone with the Wind  78  Its eight week run at the Fulton Theatre in Pittsburgh attracted over 50 000 people with reservations being made from cities located one hundred miles from the venue  79  Engagements were also held at the Geary Theatre in San Francisco for eight months  70  the Hanna Theatre in Cleveland for nine weeks  80  81  the Majestic Theatre in Boston  70  the Apollo Theater in Chicago  82  and those in Philadelphia  Detroit  Buffalo  Minneapolis  Washington  D C   and Baltimore  83  Fantasia grossed over  300 000 in the first sixteen weeks in New York  over  20 000 in the opening five weeks in San Francisco  and almost the same amount in the first ten weeks both in Los Angeles and Boston  73  The first eleven roadshows earned a total of  1 3 million by April 1941  74  but the  85 000 in production and installation costs of a single Fantasound setup  58  84  along with theatres having to be leased  85  forced the Disneys to exceed their loan limits  86  The onset of the Second World War ceased plans for a potential release in Europe  which formed as much as forty five per cent of the studio s income  72  Up to eighty eight engagements were outlined across five years  but wartime demands for equipment limited the number of Fantasound prints to sixteen  74  All but one of the setups were dismantled and given to the war effort  1  Upon acquiring the film s distribution rights April 1941  RKO continued the roadshow booking policy but presented the film in mono  which was easier to exhibit  87  88  The combined average receipts from each roadshow was around  325 000  which placed Fantasia at an even greater loss than Pinocchio  89  1942  1946  1956 and 1963 runs Disney allowed RKO to handle the general release of Fantasia  but fought their decision to have the film cut  He gave in as the studio needed as much income as possible to remedy its finances  but refused to cut it himself   You can get anybody you want to edit it   I can t do it   90  With no input from Disney  musical director Ed Plumb and Ben Sharpsteen reduced Fantasia to one hour and forty minutes at first  then to one hour and twenty minutes by removing most of Taylor s commentary and the Toccata and Fugue  86  91 Fantasia was re released in January 1942 at more popular prices with a mono soundtrack  and was placed on the lower half of double bills with the Western film Valley of the Sun  92  RKO reissued Fantasia once more in 1946 with most of the animated sequences left intact  while the scenes of Taylor  Stokowski  and the orchestra were either shortened  voiced over or removed  Its running time was restored to one hour and fifty five minutes  This edit would be the standard form for the next few re releases  and was the basis for the 1990 reissue  67   I wanted a special show just like Cinerama plays today   I had Fantasia set for a wide screen  I had dimensional sound   To get that wide screen I had the projector running sideways   I had the double frame  But I didn t get to building my cameras or my projectors because the money problem came in   The compromise was that it finally went out standard with dimensional sound  I think if I d had the money and I could have gone ahead I d have a really sensational show at that time   Walt Disney on the widescreen release in 1956  89  By 1955 the original sound negatives began to deteriorate  though a four track copy had survived in good condition  Using the remaining Fantasound system at the studio  a three track stereo copy was transferred across telephone wires onto magnetic film at an RCA facility in Hollywood  1  This copy was used when Fantasia was reissued in stereo by Buena Vista Distribution in SuperScope  a derivative of the anamorphic widescreen CinemaScope format  on February 7  1956  67  The projector featured an automatic control mechanism designed by Disney engineers that was coupled to a variable anamorphic lens  which allowed the picture to switch between its Academy standard aspect ratio of 1 33 1 to the wide ratio of 2 35 1 in twenty seconds without a break in the film  This was achieved by placing the cues that controlled the mechanism on a separate track in addition to the three audio channels  Only selected parts of the animation were stretched  while all live action scenes remained unchanged  93  This reissue garnered some criticism from viewers  as the widescreen format led to the cropping and reframing of the images  94  On February 20  1963  Fantasia was re released in both standard and SuperScope versions with stereo sound  though existing records are unclear  Its running time was fifty six seconds longer than the previous issue which is unexplained  67  This was the final release that occurred before Disney s death in 1966  1969  1977  1982  1985 and 1990 runs Fantasia began to make a profit from its  2 28 million budget after its return to theaters on December 17  1969  1  67  The film was promoted with a psychedelic styled advertising campaign  and it became popular among teenagers and college students who were reported to have taken drugs for a psychedelic experience  95  Animator Ollie Johnston recalled that young people  thought we were on a trip when we made it   every time we d go to talk to a school or something  they d ask us what we were on   96  The release is also noted for the controversial removal of four scenes from The Pastoral Symphony over racial stereotyping  Fantasia was issued on a regular basis  typically for exhibition in art houses in college towns  until the mid 1970s  67  The film was reissued nationwide once more on April 15  1977  this time with simulated stereo sound  1  72  This edit featured the RKO distribution logo being replaced with that of Buena Vista Distribution  since RKO had not been part of a release since 1946  It had not been removed earlier as the credit sequence would have required to be re shot  A two and a half minute reduction in the film s running time in this version remains unclear in existing records  67  Tim Matheson  left  provided the narration in the 1985 re release  For the 1982 and 1985 releases Disney presented Fantasia with a completely new soundtrack recorded in Dolby Stereo  First released on April 2  1982 67  this version of the film marked the first time a film s soundtrack had been digitally re recorded in its entirety  To replace Stokowski s recordings  the noted film conductor Irwin Kostal was engaged  He directed a 121 piece orchestra and 50 voice choir 97  for the recording that took place over eighteen sessions and cost  1 million  98  To maintain continuity with the animation Kostal based his performance on the tempos and pacing of the Stokowski recordings  including the cuts and revisions to The Rite of Spring  However  for Night on Bald Mountain he used Mussorgsky s original orchestration instead of the more standard version by Nikolai Rimsky Korsakov that was used by Stokowski  The new recording also corrected a two frame lag in projection caused by the old recording techniques used in the 1930s  2  Deems Taylor s scenes were deleted and a much briefer voiceover narration was recorded by Hugh Douglas 67  as the studio felt the modern audience  is more sophisticated and knowledgeable about music   2  This version returned to around 400 theaters in 1985  99  this time with actor Tim Matheson providing the narration  100  For its fiftieth anniversary  Fantasia returned to 550 theaters nationwide on October 5  1990 in its traditional 1946 version including the live action scenes with Taylor and the original Stokowski score  The film underwent a two year restoration process which began after a six month search to piece together the original negatives that had been in storage since 1946  This marked the first time since then that a release of the film had been processed from the original and not from a copy  101  Each of its 535 680 frames were restored at YCM Laboratories  102  and an untouched print from 1951 was used for guidance on color and tone  101  Theaters were required to have specific stereo equipment installed  and to present the film in its original 1 33 1 aspect ratio with black borders on the side of their screens  96  103  The Stokowski soundtrack was digitally remastered using the 1955 magnetic soundtrack  with an estimated three thousand pops and hisses being removed in the process  57  58  103  The 1990 reissue of Fantasia went on to gross  25 million domestically  104  Home media Audio Disney considered to release a three LP set of the Stokowski score in conjunction to the film s 1940 roadshow release  but this idea was let go  21  The set was ultimately released in sixteen countries 105  by Disneyland Records in 1957 70  under the catalog number WDX 101  Disney was required to obtain permission from Stokowski  who initially rejected the deal unless the Philadelphia Orchestra Association received a share of the royalties  105  The soundtrack was remastered and issued as a two disc CD in 1991 which attracted sales of 100 000 units 70  106  and was re released in 2006  In 1982  Buena Vista Records released a two disc edition of the Kostal recording  97  Video Fantasia has received three home video releases  The first  featuring the 1990 restored theatrical version  was released on VHS and laser disc on November 1  1991 as part of the  Walt Disney Classics  line  The 50 day release prompted 9 25 million advance orders for cassettes and a record 200 000 for discs  doubling the figure of the previous record  The  Deluxe Edition  package included the film  a  making of  feature  a commemorative lithograph  a 16 page booklet  a two disc soundtrack of the Stokowski score and a certificate of authenticity signed by Roy E  Disney  the nephew of Walt  104 Fantasia became the biggest selling sell through cassette of all time with 14 2 million copies being purchased  107  The record was surpassed by Beauty and the Beast in December 1992  108  This version was also released as a DVD in 2000  outside of the U S  in the United Kingdom and other countries  again under the  Walt Disney Classics  banner  109  In November 2000  Fantasia was released on video for the second time  this time along with Fantasia 2000  on DVD with 5 1 surround sound  The films were issued both separately and in a three disc set called The Fantasia Anthology  A variety of bonus features were included in the bonus disc  The Fantasia Legacy  This edition attempted to follow as closely as possible the runtime and format of the original roadshow version  and included additional restored live action footage of Taylor and the orchestra  including the bookends to the film s intermission  110  In the 2000 and 2010 releases  Deems Taylor s voice has been overdubbed throughout by Corey Burton because most of the audio tracks to Taylor s restored scenes have been lost  111  The 2000 UK release  however  was in the 1991 video version  109  Both films were reissued again by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in November 2010 separately  as a two disc DVD Blu ray set and a combined DVD and Blu ray four disc  named the  Fantasia 2 Movie Collection   set that featured 1080p high definition video and 7 1 surround sound  112  The 2010 version of Fantasia featured a new restoration by Reliance MediaWorks and a new sound restoration  113  but was editorially identical to the 2000 version  114  This marked the first time the roadshow version was released in Europe  Fantasia was withdrawn from release and returned to the  Disney Vault  moratorium on April 30  2011  although it remains on sale until existing stocks are depleted   115  116  Reception Critical response Among those at the film s premiere was film critic Bosley Crowther of The New York Times  who noted that  motion history was made last night   Fantasia dumps conventional formulas overboard and reveals the scope of films for imaginative excursion   Fantasia   is simply terrific   72  Peyton Boswell  an editor at Art Digest  called it  an aesthetic experience never to be forgotten   84 Time magazine described the premiere as  stranger and more wonderful than any of Hollywood s  and the experience of Fantasound  as if the hearer were in the midst of the music  As the music sweeps to a climax  it froths over the proscenium arch  boils into the rear of the theatre  all but prances up and down the aisles   49 Dance Magazine devoted its lead story to the film  saying that  the most extraordinary thing about Fantasia is  to a dancer or balletomane  not the miraculous musical recording  the range of color  or the fountainous integrity of the Disney collaborators  but quite simply the perfection of its dancing   72 Variety also hailed Fantasia  calling it  a successful experiment to life the relationship from the plane of popular  mass entertainment to the higher strata of appeal to lovers of classical music   117 The Chicago Tribune assigned three writers to cover the film s Chicago premiere  society columnist Harriet Pribble  film critic Mae Tinee  and music critic Edward Barry  Pribble left amazed at the  brilliantly attired audience   while Tinee felt the film was  beautiful   but it is also bewildering  It is stupendous  It is colossal  It is an overwhelmingly ambitious orgy of color  sound  and imagination   Barry was pleased with the  program of good music well performed   and beautifully recorded  and felt  pleasantly distracted  from the music to what was shown on the screen  82  In a breakdown of reviews from both film and music critics  Disney author Paul Anderson found 33  to be  very positive   22  both  positive  and  positive and negative   and 11  negative  118  Those who adopted a more negative view at the time of the film s release were mostly music critics who resisted the idea of presenting classical music with visual images  Composer and music critic Virgil Thomson praised Fantasound which he thought offered  good transmission of music   but disliked the  musical taste  of Stokowski  with exception to The Sorcerer s Apprentice and The Rite of Spring  72 Olin Downes of The New York Times too hailed the quality of sound that Fantasound presented  but felt that  much of Fantasia distracted from or directly injured the scores   72  Film critic Pauline Kael dismissed parts of Fantasia as  grotesquely kitschy   119  Some parents resisted paying the higher roadshow prices for their children  and several complained that the Night on Bald Mountain segment had frightened them  90  Fantasia holds a  fresh  rating on Rotten Tomatoes  a website which aggregates film reviews  Its consensus    A landmark in animation and a huge influence on the medium of music video  Disney s Fantasia is a relentlessly inventive blend of the classics with phantasmagorical images   98  of critics gave the film a positive review based on a sample of 48 reviews  with an average score of 8 6 out of 10  Among the website s  top critics  it holds a positive rating of 86  from seven reviews  120 Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times rated the film four stars out of four  and noted that throughout Fantasia   Disney pushes the edges of the envelope   121  Remarks have also been made about Fantasia not being a children s film  Reporting on the popular culture site Inside Pulse and in The Eagle newspaper  Robert Saucedo remembered to be  not the only one   having to sit through the movie as a kid fidgeting in your seat as the film delivers abstract image after abstract image   concluding that Fantasia is  for adults and very nerdy kids   122  123  while news and gossip website PopSugar included Fantasia in its  10 Movies That Scared Buzz Readers as Kids  list  124  Paul Trandahl of the non profit advocacy group Common Sense Media  referred to both of the aforementioned criticism  saying  While there are enchanting dancing flowers  hippos  unicorns    there are at least as many very threatening images intensified by the shadowy dark music  and that  some additional selections   are very long  slow and may not fully engage today s kids   with the site giving the film an  Ages 6 and Up  rating  125  Awards and honors Fantasia ranked fifth at the 1940 National Board of Review Awards in the Top Ten Films category  126  Disney and Stokowski won a Special Award for the film at the 1940 New York Film Critics Circle Awards  127 Fantasia was the subject of two Academy Honorary Awards on February 26  1942   one for Disney  William Garity  John N  A  Hawkins  and the RCA Manufacturing Company for their  outstanding contribution to the advancement of the use of sound in motion pictures through the production of Fantasia   and the other to Stokowski  and his associates for their unique achievement in the creation of a new form of visualized music in Walt Disney s production Fantasia  thereby widening the scope of the motion picture as entertainment and as an art form   128  In 1990  Fantasia was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being  culturally  historically  or aesthetically significant   129  On the 100th anniversary of cinema in 1995  the Vatican included Fantasia in its list of 45  great films  made under the Art category  the others being Religion and Values  130  Fantasia is featured in three lists that rank the greatest American films as determined by the American Film Institute  The film ranked number 58 in 100 Years    100 Movies in 1998 131  before it was dropped from its 10th Anniversary revision in 2007  132  though it was nominated for inclusion  133  The 10 Top 10 list formed in 2008 placed Fantasia fifth under Animation  131  Controversies In the late 1960s  four short scenes from The Pastoral Symphony were removed that depicted two characters in a racially stereotyped manner  A black centaurette called Sunflower was depicted polishing the hooves of a white centaurette  and a second named Otika appeared briefly during the procession scenes with Bacchus and his followers  134  According to Disney archivist David Smith  the sequence was aired uncut on television in 1966 before the edits were made for the film s 1969 theatrical reissue  135 John Carnochan  the editor responsible for the change in the 1991 video release  said  It s sort of appalling to me that these stereotypes were ever put in   136  Film critic Roger Ebert commented on the edit    While the original film should  of course  be preserved for historical purposes  there is no need for the general release version to perpetrate racist stereotypes in a film designed primarily for children   137  The edits have been in place in all subsequent theatrical and home video reissues  In May 1992  the Philadelphia Orchestra Association filed a lawsuit against The Walt Disney Company and Buena Vista Home Video  The orchestra maintained that as a co creator of Fantasia  the group was entitled to half of the estimated  120 million in profits from video and laser disc sales  106  The orchestra dropped its case in 1994 when the two parties reached an undisclosed settlement out of court  138  British music publisher Boosey  amp  Hawkes filed a further lawsuit in 1993  contending that Disney did not have the rights to distribute The Rite of Spring in the 1991 video releases because the permission granted to Disney by Stravinsky in 1940 was only in the context of a film to be shown in theaters  139  The United States district court backed Boosey  amp  Hawkes s case in 1996  140  but the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling in 1998  stating that Disney s original  license for motion picture rights extends to video format distribution   141  Additional material Disney had wanted Fantasia to be an ongoing project  with a new edition being released every few years  142  His plan was to substitute one of the original segments with a new one as it was complete  so the viewer would always see a new version of the film  70  From January to August 1941  story material was developed based on additional pieces  including Ride of the Valkyries by Richard Wagner  The Swan of Tuonela by Jean Sibelius  Invitation to the Dance by Carl Maria von Weber  Flight of the Bumblebee by Nikolai Rimsky Korsakov  13  70  which was later adapted into the Bumble Boogie segment in Melody Time  1948   and there was even consideration for a segment inspired by the Polka and Fugue from Schwanda the Bagpiper by Jarom r Weinberger  The film s disappointing initial box office performance and the advent of World War II brought an end to these plans  143  Taylor had prepared introductions for The Firebird by Stravinsky  La Mer by Claude Debussy  Adventures in a Perambulator by John Alden Carpenter  Don Quixote by Richard Strauss  and Pictures at an Exhibition by Mussorgsky  to have them for the future in case we decided to make any one of them   142  144  Clair de Lune was another segment that was part of the film s original program  After being completely animated  it was cut out of the final film to shorten its already long running time  The segment featured two egrets flying through the Everglades on a moonlit night  The sequence was later edited and re scored for the Blue Bayou segment in Make Mine Music  1946   A workprint of the original was discovered and Clair de Lune was restored in 1992  complete with the original soundtrack of Stokowski with the Philadelphia Orchestra  It was included as a bonus feature in The Fantasia Anthology DVD in 2000  111  Legacy Sequel  Fantasia is timeless  It may run 10  20 or 30 years  It may run after I m gone  Fantasia is an idea in itself  I can never build another Fantasia  I can improve  I can elaborate  That s all   Walt Disney 13  In 1980  the Los Angeles Times reported that animators Wolfgang Reitherman and Mel Shaw had begun work on Musicana   an ambitious concept mixing jazz  classical music  myths  modern art and more  following the old Fantasia format   145  Animation historian Charles Solomon wrote that development took place between 1982 and 1983  which combined  ethnic tales from around the world with the music of the various countries   Proposed segments for the film included a battle between an ice god and a sun goddess set to Finlandia by Sibelius  one set in the Andes to the songs of Yma Sumac  and another featuring caricatures of Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald  The project was shelved in favor of Mickey s Christmas Carol  146  Roy E  Disney  the nephew of Walt  co produced Fantasia 2000 which entered production in 1990 and features seven new segments performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra with conductor James Levine  147 The Sorcerer s Apprentice is the only segment retained from the original film  Fantasia 2000 premiered at Carnegie Hall on December 17  1999 as part of a five city live concert tour  followed by a four month engagement in IMAX cinemas 148  and a wide release in regular theatres  in 2000  149  Parodies and spin offs Fantasia is parodied in A Corny Concerto  a Warner Bros  cartoon from 1943 of the Merrie Melodies series  The short features Elmer Fudd 150  in the role of Taylor  wearing his styled eyeglasses  who introduces two segments set to pieces by Johann Strauss  Tales from the Vienna Wood and the Blue Danube  both featuring Porky and Bugs and Daffy respectively   In 1976  Italian animator Bruno Bozzetto produced Allegro Non Troppo  a feature length parody of Fantasia  151 Walt Disney Pictures used the story of The Sorcerer s Apprentice as a basis for its eponymous fantasy adventure film in 2010  152  The animated television series The Simpsons references Fantasia in a few episodes  Matt Groening  the creator of the franchise  expressed a wish to make a parody film named Simpstasia  it was never produced  partly because it would have been too difficult to write a feature length script  153  In  Treehouse of Horror IV   director David Silverman had admired the animation in Night on Bald Mountain  and made the first appearance of Devil Flanders resemble Chernabog  154  The episode  Itchy  amp  Scratchy Land  references The Sorcerer s Apprentice in a snippet titled  Scratchtasia  that features the music and several shots parodying it exactly  155  Fantasia is also referenced in the animated series South Park in the episode  Chef s Chocolate Salty Balls   where Mr  Hankey dons a wizard outfit and drives out an independent film festival by summoning a wave of sewage  similar to Mickey s dream of summoning a storm in The Sorcerer s Apprentice  Theme parks The Sorcerer s Hat in Disney s Hollywood Studios  The Sorcerer s Hat is the icon of Disney s Hollywood Studios  one of the four theme parks located at Walt Disney World Resort  The structure is of the magic hat from The Sorcerer s Apprentice  156  Also located at the resort is Fantasia Gardens  a miniature golf course that integrates characters and objects from the film in each hole  157  The fireworks and water show Fantasmic  features scenes from The Sorcerer s Apprentice and other Fantasia segments on water projection screens  and involves the plot of Mickey as the apprentice doing battle with the Disney Villains  158  For the 20th anniversary of Disneyland Paris  Mickey will be depicted in a special version of his Sorcerer s Apprentice outfit  Video games In 1991  a side scrolling eponymous video game developed by Infogrames was released for the Sega Mega Drive Genesis system  159  The player controls Mickey Mouse  who must find missing musical notes scattered across four elemental worlds based upon the film s segments  The Disney Square Enix crossover game series Kingdom Hearts features Chernabog as a boss in the first installment  160  The Night on Bald Mountain piece is played during the fight  In Kingdom Hearts II  Yen Sid is given a speaking role and is voiced in English by Corey Burton  Yen Sid also appears in Epic Mickey  a game released in 2010 for the Wii console  161  and Chernabog makes a cameo appearance in the form of a painting  Symphony of Sorcery  a video game world based on the movie  will appear in the upcoming game Kingdom Hearts 3D  Dream Drop Distance
