flagship superhero title  Fantastic Four  creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby collaborated on an antagonist designed to break from the archetypal mold of supervillains of the time  and be instead a being of god like stature and power  4  As Lee recalled in 1993  Galactus was simply another in a long line of super villains whom we loved creating  Having dreamed up  many  powerful baddies     we felt the only way to top ourselves was to come up with an evil doer who had almost godlike powers  Therefore  the natural choice was sort of demi god  but now what would we do with him  We didn t want to use the tired old cliche about him wanting to conquer the world      That was when inspiration struck  Why not have him not be a really evil person  After all  a demi god would be beyond mere good and evil       What  he d require is the life force and energy from living planets  7  Kirby described his Biblical inspirations for Galactus and an accompanying character  an angelic herald Lee dubbed the Silver Surfer  My inspirations were the fact that I had to make sales  And I had to come up with characters that were no longer stereotypes     I had to get something new  And     for some reason  I went to the Bible  And I came up with Galactus  And there I was in front of this tremendous figure  who I knew very well  because I always felt him  and I certainly couldn t treat him the same way that I would any ordinary mortal     and of course the Silver Surfer is the fallen angel      T hey were figures that have never been used before in comics  They were above mythic figures  and of course  they were the first gods  8  Kirby further explained   Galactus in actuality is a sort of god  He is beyond reproach  beyond anyone s opinion  In a way he is kind of a Zeus  who fathered Hercules  He is his own legend  and of course  he and the Silver Surfer are sort of modern legends  and they are designed that way   9  Writer Mike Conroy expanded on Lee and Kirby s explanation  stating   In five short years from the launch of the Fantastic Four  the Lee Kirby duo   had introduced a whole host of alien races or their representatives   there were the Skrulls  the Watcher and the Stranger  all of whom Lee and Kirby used in the foundations of the universe they were constructing  one where all things were possible but only if they did not flout the  natural laws  of this cosmology  In the nascent Marvel Universe  characters acted consistently  whatever comic they were appearing in  Their actions reverberated through every title  It was pure soap opera but on a cosmic scale  and Galactus epitomized its epic sweep   10  All this led to the introduction of Galactus in Fantastic Four  48 50  March May 1966   which fans began calling  The Galactus Trilogy   3  4  11  12  13  Kirby did not intend for Galactus to reappear in order to preserve the character s tremendous presence  14  Popularity among fans  however  prompted Lee to petition Kirby for Galactus  reappearance  14  and the character eventually became a mainstay in the Marvel Universe  First cover appearance of Galactus  Fantastic Four  49  April 1966   Cover art by penciler and character co

identical to the previous origin  the story featured supplemental material  edits  and deletions by writer Mark Gruenwald  pencillers John Byrne and Ron Wilson  and inker Jack Abel  Most specifically

in Fantastic Four  262  January 1984  attracted controversy  During the conclusion of the story  the character Eternity  the living sentience of the Marvel Universe  appears to validate the existence of Galactus  which Howard University Professor of Literature Marc Singer criticized  stating writer artist John Byrne used the character as a means to  justify planetary scale genocide   15  Writer penciler John Byrne and inker Terry Austin produced  The Last Galactus Story  as a serial in the anthology comics magazine Epic Illustrated  26 34  October 1984   February 1986   Nine of a scheduled

the story arc to take place in third volume of the Silver Surfer  but the title was canceled due to dwindling sales  Simonson instead proposed a separate limited series  and at the time was initially doubtful that Marvel would approve what she believed to be a  radical  idea concerning  why the very existence of the universe depends on the health and well being of Galactus   17   edit  2000s The consequences of Galactus  death are explored in Fantastic Four Annual 2001 and Fantastic Four  46 49  October 2001   January 2002   resulting in Galactus  revival  Galactus features prominently in the first six issues of the series Thanos  December 2003   May 2004   written by Jim Starlin  The story is noteworthy due to a running theme of highly critical evaluation of the standard justifications
