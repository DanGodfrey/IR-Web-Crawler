Korea   listen   officially the Republic of Korea  Korean  Daehan Minguk  listen   is a sovereign state in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula  6  It is described in a 1948 U N  resolution as the only lawful government in Korea  7  The name  Korea  is derived from Goryeo  a dynasty which ruled in the Middle Ages  Its neighbors are China to the west  Japan to the east  North Korea to the north  and the East China Sea to the south  South Korea lies in the north temperate zone with a predominantly mountainous terrain  It covers a total area of 99 392 square kilometers 8  and has a population of almost 50 million  The capital and largest city is Seoul  with a population of 9 794 304  Archaeological findings show that the Korean Peninsula was occupied by the Lower Paleolithic period  9  10 Korean history begins with the founding of Gojoseon in 2333 BC by the legendary Dan gun  Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Silla 668 AD  Korea went through the Goryeo Dynasty and Joseon Dynasty as one nation until the end of the Korean Empire in 1910  when it was annexed by Japan  After liberation and occupation by Soviet and U S  forces at the end of World War II  the nation was divided into North and South Korea  The latter was established in 1948 as a democracy  though political turmoil and times of military rule and martial law characterized much of the period until the foundation of the Sixth Republic in 1987  After the invasion of South Korea by forces from the North on June 25  1950  the resulting war between the two Koreas ended with an Armistice Agreement  but the border between the two nations is the most heavily fortified in the world  11  After the war  the South Korean economy grew significantly and the country was transformed into a major economy  12  a full democracy  and a regional power in East Asia  South Korea is a presidential republic consisting of sixteen administrative divisions and is a developed country with a very high standard of living  It is Asia s fourth largest economy and the world s 15th  nominal  or 12th  purchasing power parity  largest economy  13  The economy is export driven  with production focusing on electronics  automobiles  ships  machinery  petrochemicals and robotics  South Korea is a member of the United Nations  WTO  OECD and G 20 major economies  It is also a

article  History of Korea Jikji  the first known book printed with movable metal type in 1377  Biblioth que Nationale de Paris  Korean history begins with the founding of Cho Sun  often known as  Gojoseon  to prevent confusion with another dynasty founded in the 14th century  the prefix Go  means  older   before  or  earlier   in 2333 BC by Dangun  according to Korean foundation mythology  14  Go Cho Sun expanded until it controlled northern Korean Peninsula and some parts of Manchuria  After many conflicts with the Chinese Dynasty Han Dynasty  Go Cho Sun disintegrated  leading to the Proto Three Kingdoms of Korea period  In the early centuries of the Common Era  Buyeo  Okjeo  Dongye  and the Samhan confederacy occupied the peninsula and southern Manchuria  Of the various states  Goguryeo  Baekje  and Silla grew to control the peninsula as Three Kingdoms of Korea  The unification of the Three Kingdoms by Silla in 676 led to the North South States Period  in which much of the Korean Peninsula was controlled by Unified Silla  while Balhae succeeded to have the control of northern parts of Goguryeo  In Unified Silla  poetry and art was encouraged  and Buddhist culture thrived  Relationships between Korea and China remained relatively peaceful during this time  However  Unified Silla weakened under internal strife  and surrendered to Goryeo in 935  Balhae  Silla s neighbor to the north  was formed as a successor state to Goguryeo  During its height  Balhae controlled most of Manchuria and parts of Russian Far East  It fell to the Khitan in 926  The peninsula was united by Emperor Taejo of Goryeo in 936  Like Silla  Goryeo was a highly cultural state and created the Jikji in 1377  using the world s oldest movable metal type printing press  15  The Mongol invasions in the 13th century greatly weakened Goryeo  After nearly 30 years of war  Goryeo continued to rule Korea  though as a tributary ally to the Mongols  After the Mongolian Empire collapsed  severe political strife followed and the Goryeo Dynasty was replaced by the Joseon Dynasty in 1392 following a rebellion by General Yi Seong gye  Gyeongbok Palace is the largest of the Five Grand Palaces built during the Joseon Dynasty  King Taejo declared the new name of Korea as  Joseon  in reference to Gojoseon  and moved the capital to Hanseong  old name of Seoul   The first 200 years of the Joseon Dynasty were marked by relative peace and saw the creation of Hangul by King Sejong the Great in the 14th century and the rise in influence of Confucianism in the country  Between 1592 and 1598  the Japanese invaded Korea  Toyotomi Hideyoshi led the forces and tried to invade the Asian continent through Korea  but was eventually repelled by the Righteous army and assistance from Ming Dynasty China  This war also saw the rise of Admiral Yi Sun sin and his renowned  turtle ship   In the 1620s and 1630s  Joseon suffered from invasions by the Manchu who eventually conquered all of China  After another series of wars against Manchuria  Joseon experienced a nearly 200 year period of peace  King Yeongjo and King Jeongjo particularly led a new renaissance of the Joseon Dynasty  However  the latter years of the Joseon Dynasty were marked by a dependence on China for external affairs and isolation from the outside world  During the 19th century  Korea s isolationist policy earned it the name the  Hermit Kingdom   The Joseon Dynasty tried to protect itself against Western imperialism  but was eventually forced to open trade  After the First Sino Japanese War and the Russo Japanese War  Korea was occupied by Japan  1910 1945   At the end of World War II  the Japanese surrendered to Soviet and U S  forces who occupied the northern and southern halves of Korea  respectively   edit  After the division Main article  History of South Korea Despite the initial plan of a unified Korea in the 1943 Cairo Declaration  escalating Cold War antagonism between the Soviet Union and the United States eventually led to the establishment of separate governments  each with its own ideology  leading to Korea s division into two political entities in 1948  North Korea and South Korea  In the North  a former anti Japanese guerrilla and communist activist  Kim Il sung gained power through Soviet support  In the South  elections supervised by the United Nations were held  a Republic of Korea was declared  and Syngman Rhee inaugurated as its first president  In December  the UN General Assembly declared this  a lawful government  and  the only such government in Korea   7  United Nations troops fighting in the streets of Seoul  September 1950 On June 25  1950  North Korea invaded South Korea  sparking the Korean War  the Cold War s first major conflict  At the time  the Soviet Union had boycotted the United Nations  UN   thus forfeiting their veto rights  This allowed the UN to intervene in a civil war when it became apparent that the superior North Korean forces would unify the entire country  The Soviet Union and China backed North Korea  with the later participation of millions of Chinese troops  After huge advances on both sides  and massive losses among Korean civilians in both the north and the south  the war eventually reached a stalemate  The 1953 armistice  never signed by South Korea  split the peninsula along the demilitarized zone near the original demarcation line  No peace treaty was ever signed  resulting in the two countries remaining technically at war  At least 2 5 million people died during the Korean War  16  View of Seoul s Gangnam district in 2009 Namdaemun is a historic pagoda style gateway  In 1960  a student uprising  the  4 19 Revolution   led to the resignation of the autocratic President Syngman Rhee  A period of political instability followed  broken by General Park Chung hee s military coup  the  5 16 coup d  tat   against the weak and ineffectual government the next year  Park took over as president until his assassination in 1979  overseeing rapid export led economic growth as well as severe political repression  Park was heavily criticised as a ruthless military dictator  although the Korean economy developed significantly during his tenure  The years after Park s assassination were marked again by political turmoil  as the previously repressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void  In 1979 there was Coup d  tat of December Twelfth by General Chun Doo hwan  After the Coup d  tat  Chun Doo hwan planned to rise to power with several measures  On May 17  Chun Doo hwan forced the Cabinet to expand martial law to the whole nation  which had previously not applied to Jeju do  The expanded martial law closed universities  banned political activities and further curtailed the press  Chun assumed the presidency by the event of May 17  triggering nationwide protests demanding democracy  in particular in the city of Gwangju  where Chun sent special forces to violently suppress the Gwangju Democratization Movement  17  Chun subsequently created the National Defense Emergency Policy Committee and took the presidency according to his political plan  Chun and his government held Korea under a despotic rule until 1987  when a Seoul National University student  Park Jong chul  was tortured to death  18  On June 10  the Catholic Priests Association for Justice revealed the incident  igniting huge demonstrations around the country  Eventually  Chun s party  the Democratic Justice Party  and its leader  Roh Tae woo announced the 6 29 Declaration  which included the direct election of the president  Roh went on to win the election by a narrow margin against the two main opposition leaders  Kim Dae Jung and Kim Young Sam  In 1988  Seoul hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics  It became a member of the Organization for Economic Co operation and Development  OECD  in 1996  19  It was adversely affected by the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis  However  the country was able to recover and continue its economic growth  albeit at a slower pace  In June 2000  as part of president Kim Dae Jung s  Sunshine Policy  of engagement  a North South summit took place in Pyongyang  the capital of North Korea  Later that year  Kim received the Nobel Peace Prize  for his work for democracy and human rights in South Korea and in East Asia in general  and for peace and reconciliation with North Korea in particular   20  In 2002  South Korea and Japan jointly co hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup  however South Korean and Japanese relations later soured due to conflicting claims of sovereignty over the Liancourt Rocks   Dokdo  in Korea   in what became known as the Liancourt Rocks dispute   edit  Government Main article  Government of South Korea The National Assembly of South Korea Under its current constitution the state is sometimes referred to as the Sixth Republic of South Korea  Like many democratic states  21  South Korea has a government divided into three branches  executive  judicial  and legislative  The executive and legislative branches operate primarily at the national level  although various ministries in the executive branch also carry out local functions  Local governments are semi autonomous  and contain executive and legislative bodies of their own  The judicial branch operates at both the national and local levels  South Korea is a constitutional democracy  The South Korean government s structure is determined by the Constitution of the Republic of Korea  This document has been revised several times since its first promulgation in 1948 at independence  However  it has retained many broad characteristics and with the exception of the short lived Second Republic of South Korea  the country has always had a presidential system with an independent chief executive  22  The first direct election was also held in 1948  Although South Korea experienced a series of military dictatorships from the 1960s up until the 1980s  it has since developed into a successful liberal democracy  Today  the CIA World Factbook describes South Korea s democracy as a  fully functioning modern democracy   23   edit  Administrative divisions Main articles  Provinces of South Korea and Administrative divisions of South Korea See also Special cities of Korea and

Before the formation of South Korea  Korean independence fighters worked with Chinese soldiers during the Japanese occupation  However  after World War II  the People s Republic of China embraced Maoism while South Korea sought close relations with the United States  The PRC assisted North Korea with manpower and supplies during the Korean War  and in its aftermath the diplomatic relationship between South Korea and the PRC almost completely ceased  Relations thawed gradually and South Korea and the PRC re established formal diplomatic relations on August 24  1992  The two countries sought to improve bilateral relations and lifted the forty year old trade embargo  26  and South Korean Chinese relations have improved steadily since 1992  26  The Republic of Korea broke off official relations with the Republic of China upon gaining official relations with the People s Republic of China  27   edit  European Union The European Union  EU  and South Korea are important trading partners  having negotiated a free trade agreement for many years since South Korea was designated as a priority FTA partner in 2006  The free trade agreement was approved in September 2010  and took effect on July 1  2011  28  South Korea is the EU s eighth largest trade partner  and the EU has become South Korea s second largest export destination  EU trade with South Korea exceeded  65 billion in 2008 and has enjoyed an annual average growth rate of 7 5  between 2004 and 2008  29  The EU has been the single largest foreign investor in South Korea since 1962  and accounted for almost 45  of all FDI inflows into Korea in 2006  Nevertheless  EU companies have significant problems accessing and operating in the South Korean market due to stringent standards and testing requirements for products and services often creating barriers to trade  Both in its regular bilateral contacts with South Korea and through its FTA with Korea  the EU is seeking to improve this situation  29   edit  Japan Main article  Japan Korea relations Liancourt Rocks has become an issue known as the Liancourt Rocks dispute Although there were no formal diplomatic ties between South Korea and Japan after the

Government share of GDP  14 967    while maintaining compulsory conscription for men  47  Consequently  South Korea has the world s sixth largest number of active troops  48  the world s second largest number of reserve troops 48  and the eleventh largest defense budget  The Republic of Korea  with a regular military force numbering 3 7 million regular personnel among a total national

Many of these forces are concentrated near the Korean Demilitarized Zone  All South Korean males are constitutionally required to serve in the military  typically for a period of two years  Previously  Koreans of mixed race were exempt from military duty if they  look distinctively biracial   but such policy is potentially up for abolition pending further review by the Ministry of Defence  51  In addition to male conscription in South Korea s sovereign military  1000 Korean males are selected every year to serve two years in the KATUSA Program to further augment the USFK  52  In 2010  South Korea was spending  1 68 trillion in a cost sharing agreement with the US to provide budgetary support to the US forces in Korea  on top the  29 6 trillion budget for its own military  The South Korean army has 2 500 tanks in operation  including the K1A1 and K2 Black Panther  which form the backbone of the South Korean army s mechanized armor and infantry forces  A sizable arsenal of many artillery systems  including 1 700 self propelled K55 and K9 Thunder howitzers  and 680 helicopters and UAVs of numerous types  are assembled to provide additional fire  reconnaissance  and logistics support  South Korea s smaller but more advanced artillery force and wide range of airborne reconnaissance platforms are pivotal in the counter battery suppression of North Korea s over sized artillery force  which operates more than 13 000 artillery systems deployed in various state of fortification and mobility  48  53  The South Korean navy has made its first major transformation into a blue water navy through the formation of the Strategic Mobile Fleet  which includes a battle group of Chungmugong Yi Sun sin class destroyers  Dokdo class amphibious assault ship  AIP driven Type 214 submarines  and King Sejong the Great class destroyers  which is equipped with the latest baseline of Aegis fleet defense system that allows the ships to track and destroy multiple cruise missiles and

time to time  South Korea has sent its troops overseas to assist American forces  It has participated in most major conflicts that the United States has been involved in the past 50 years  South Korea dispatched 325 517 troops to fight alongside American  Australian  Filipino  New Zealand and South Vietnamese soldiers in the Vietnam War  with a peak strength of 50 000  In 2004  South Korea sent 3 300 troops of the Zaytun Division to help re building in northern Iraq  and was the third largest contributor in the coalition forces after only the US and Britain  59  Beginning in 2001  South Korea had so far deployed 24 000 troops in the Middle East region to support the War on Terrorism  A further 1 800 were deployed since 2007 to reinforce UN peacekeeping forces in Lebanon  The United States have stationed a substantial contingent of troops in South Korea since the Korean War to defend South Korea in case of East Asian military crises  There are approximately 28 500 U S  Military personnel stationed in Korea  60  most of them serving one year of unaccompanied tours  The American troops  which primarily are assigned to the Eighth United States Army are stationed in

diplomatic rows between the two allies  While South Korea is successful in exporting its electricity generating nuclear technology and nuclear reactors  it cannot capitalize on the market for nuclear enrichment facilities and refineries  preventing Korea from further expanding its export niche  South Korea has sought unique technologies such as pyroprocessing technology to circumvent these

buildings constructed during that time  168  Korean architecture entered a new phase of development during the post Korean War reconstruction  incorporating modern architectural trends and styles  Stimulated by the economic growth in the 1970s and 1980s  active redevelopment saw new horizons in architectural design  In the aftermath of the 1988 Seoul Olympics  South Korea has witnessed a wide variation of styles in its architectural landscape due  in large part  to the opening up of the market to foreign architects  169  Contemporary architectural efforts have been constantly trying to
