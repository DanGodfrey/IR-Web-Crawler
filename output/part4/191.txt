Washington   the District   or simply D C   is the capital of the United States  On July 16  1790  the United States Congress approved the creation of a federal district to become the national capital as permitted by the U S  Constitution  The District is therefore not a part of any U S  state  It was formed from land along the Potomac River donated by the states of Maryland and Virginia  however  the Virginia portion was returned by Congress in 1846  A new capital city named after George Washington was founded in 1791 to the east of the preexisting port of Georgetown  Congress consolidated the City of Washington  Georgetown  and the remaining unincorporated area within the District under a single municipal government in 1871  The city shares its name with the U S  state of Washington  located on the country s Pacific coast  Washington  D C   had an estimated population of 617 996 in 2011  The city was the 24th most populous place in the United States as of 2010  Commuters from the surrounding Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city s population to over one million during the workweek  The Washington Metropolitan Area  of which the District is a part  has a population of nearly 5 6 million  the seventh largest metropolitan area in the country  The centers of all three branches of the federal government of the United States are located in the District  as are many of the nation s monuments and museums  Washington  D C   hosts 176 foreign embassies as well as the headquarters of the World Bank  the International Monetary Fund  IMF   the Organization of American States  OAS   the Inter American Development Bank  and the Pan American Health Organization  PAHO   The headquarters of many other institutions such as trade unions  non profit organizations  lobbying groups  and professional associations are also located in the city  The District is governed by a locally elected mayor and 13 member city council  However  the United States Congress has supreme authority over the city and may overturn local laws  Residents therefore have less self governance than residents of the U S  states  The District has a non voting  at large Congressional delegate  but no senators  D C  residents could not vote in presidential elections until the ratification of the Twenty third Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1961  Contents 1 History 2 Geography

the Nacotchtank inhabited the area around the Anacostia River when the first Europeans arrived in the 17th century  3  However  Native American people had largely relocated from the area by the early 18th century  4  In his  Federalist No  43   published January 23  1788  James Madison argued that the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety  5  Five years earlier  in an event known as the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783  a mob of unpaid soldiers besieged the Congress while it was meeting in Philadelphia  The Pennsylvania government refused requests to forcibly disperse the protesters  which emphasized the need for the national government not to rely on any state for its own security  6  Article One  Section Eight of the United States Constitution therefore permits the establishment of a  District  not exceeding ten miles square  as may  by cession of particular states  and the acceptance of Congress  become the seat of the government of the United States   7  However  the Constitution does not specify a location for the capital  In what later became known as the Compromise of 1790  Madison  Alexander Hamilton  and Thomas Jefferson came to an agreement that the federal government would pay each state s remaining Revolutionary War debts in exchange for establishing the new national capital in the Southern United States  8  a  The U S  Capitol after the burning of Washington during the War of 1812 On July 16  1790  Congress passed the Residence Act  which approved the creation of a national capital to be located on the Potomac River  the exact area to be selected by President George Washington  Formed from land donated by the states of Maryland and Virginia  the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles  16 km  on each side  totaling 100 square miles  260 km2   9  b  Two preexisting settlements were included in the territory  the port of Georgetown  Maryland founded in 1751  10  and the city of Alexandria  Virginia  founded in 1749  11  During 1791 92  Andrew Ellicott and several assistants  including Benjamin Banneker  surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point  12  Many of the stones are still standing  13  A new  federal city  was then constructed on the north bank of the Potomac  to the east of the established settlement at Georgetown  On September 9  1791  the three commissioners charged with overseeing the capital s construction named the city in honor of President Washington  The federal district was named Columbia  which was a poetic name for the United States in use at that time  14  15  Congress held its first session in Washington on November 17  1800  16  Shortly after arriving in the new capital  Congress passed the Organic Act of 1801  which officially organized the District of Columbia and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government  Further  the unincorporated area within the District was organized into two counties  the County of Washington to the east of the Potomac and the County of Alexandria to the west  17  After the passage of this Act  citizens located in the District were no longer considered residents of Maryland or Virginia  which therefore ended their representation in Congress  18  Ford s Theatre in the 19th century  site of the 1865 assassination of President Lincoln On August 24 25  1814  in a raid known as the Burning of Washington  British forces invaded the capital during the War of 1812  following the Battle of York  The Capitol  Treasury  and White House were burned and gutted during the attack  19  Most government buildings were quickly repaired  but the Capitol  which was at the time largely under construction  was not completed in its current form until 1868  20  In the 1830s  the District s southern territory of Alexandria went into economic decline partly due to neglect by Congress  21  Alexandria was a major market in the American slave trade and residents feared that abolitionists in Congress would end slavery in the District  further depressing the economy  As a result  Alexandrians petitioned Virginia to take back the land it had donated to form the District  a process known as retrocession  22  The state legislature voted in February 1846 to accept the return of Alexandria and on July 9  1846  Congress agreed to return all the territory that had been ceded by Virginia  Therefore  the District s current area consists only of land donated by Maryland  21  Confirming the fears of pro slavery Alexandrians  the Compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in the District  though not slavery itself  23  The outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 led to notable growth in the District s population due to the expansion of the federal government and a large influx of freed slaves  24  President Abraham Lincoln signed the Compensated Emancipation Act in 1862  which ended slavery in the District of Columbia and freed about 3 100 enslaved persons  nine months prior to the Emancipation Proclamation  25  In 1868  Congress granted male African American residents of the District the right to vote in municipal elections  24  By 1870  the District s population had grown 75  from the previous census to nearly 132 000 residents  26  Despite the city s growth  Washington still had dirt roads and lacked basic sanitation  The situation was so bad that some members of Congress suggested moving the capital further west  but President Ulysses S  Grant refused to consider such a proposal  27  Crowds surrounding the Reflecting Pool during the 1963 March on Washington Congress passed the Organic Act of 1871  which repealed the individual charters of the cities of Washington and Georgetown  and a created a new territorial government for the whole District of Columbia  28  President Grant appointed Alexander Robey Shepherd to the new position of governor in 1873  Shepherd authorized large scale municipal projects  which greatly modernized the city  However  the governor spent three times the money that had been budgeted for capital improvements  which ultimately bankrupted the District  In 1874  Congress replaced the territorial government with an appointed three member Board of Commissioners  29  The city s first motorized streetcars began service in 1888 and spurred growth in areas of the District beyond the City of Washington s original boundaries  30  In 1895  Washington formally annexed Georgetown  which until then had maintained a nominal separate identity  31  With a consolidated government and the transformation of rural areas within the District into urban neighborhoods  the entire city eventually took the name Washington  D C  30  Increased federal spending as a result of New Deal legislation in the 1930s led to the construction of new government buildings  memorials  and museums in Washington  32  World War II further increased government activity  adding to the number of federal employees in the capital  33  by 1950  the District s population reached its peak of 802 178 residents  26  The Twenty third Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1961  granting the District three votes in the Electoral College for the election of President and Vice President  but still no voting representation in Congress  After the assassination of civil rights leader Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr   on April 4  1968  riots broke out in the District  primarily in the U Street  14th Street  7th Street  and H Street corridors  centers of black residential and commercial areas  The riots raged for three days until over 13 600 federal troops managed to stop the violence  Many stores and other buildings were burned  rebuilding was not complete until the late 1990s  34  In 1973  Congress enacted the District of Columbia Home Rule Act  providing for an elected mayor and city council for the District  35  In 1975  Walter Washington became the first elected and first black mayor of the District  36  On September 11  2001  terrorists hijacked American Airlines Flight 77 and deliberately crashed the plane into the Pentagon in nearby Arlington  Virginia  United Airlines Flight 93  believed to be destined for Washington  D C   crashed in Pennsylvania when passengers tried to recover control of the plane from hijackers  37  38  Geography Main article  Geography of Washington  D C  The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal passes through the Georgetown neighborhood  The District has a total area of 68 3 square miles  177 km2   of which 61 4 square miles  159 km2  is land and 6 9 square miles  18 km2   10 16   is water  39  It is no longer 100 square miles  260 km2  due to the retrocession of the southern portion of the District back to the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1846  The city is therefore surrounded by the states of Maryland to the southeast  northeast  and northwest and Virginia to the southwest  Washington has three major natural flowing streams  the Potomac River and its tributaries the Anacostia River and Rock Creek  40 Tiber Creek  a natural watercourse that once passed through the National Mall  was fully enclosed underground during the 1870s  41  The creek also formed a portion of the now filled Washington City Canal  which allowed passage through the city to the Anacostia River from 1815 until the 1850s  42  The present Chesapeake and Ohio Canal starts in Georgetown and was used during the 19th century to bypass the Great Falls of the Potomac River  located upstream  northwest  of Washington  43  The highest natural elevation in the District of Columbia is 409 feet  125 m  above sea level at Fort Reno Park in northwest Washington  44  The lowest point is sea level at the Potomac River  The geographic center of Washington is located near the intersection of 4th and L Streets NW  45  Contrary to the urban legend  Washington was not built on a reclaimed swamp but wetlands did cover areas along the water  46  The United States government owns about 23  of the land in the District  lower than the percentage of federal lands in 12 states  47  The District has 7 464 acres of parkland  about 19  of the city s total area and the second highest percentage among high density U S  cities  48  The large percentage of city land dedicated to park areas contributes to a high urban tree canopy coverage of 35   49  The National Park Service manages most of the city s parkland  including Rock Creek Park  the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park  the National Mall and Constitution Gardens  Theodore Roosevelt Island  Fort Dupont Park  Meridian Hill Park  Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens  and Anacostia Park  50  The only significant area of natural habitat not managed by the National Park Service is the U S  National Arboretum  which is operated by the U S  Department of Agriculture  51  Climate See also  List of Maryland hurricanes  1980 present  and List of District of Columbia tornadoes The National Cherry Blossom Festival is celebrated around the city each spring  Washington is located in the humid subtropical climate zone  K ppen  Cfa  and exhibits four distinct seasons  52  Its climate is typical of Mid Atlantic U S  areas removed from bodies of water  The District is located in plant hardiness zone 8a near downtown  and zone 7b elsewhere in the city  indicating a temperate climate  53  Spring and fall are warm  while winter is cool with annual snowfall averaging 14 7 inches  37 cm   Winter temperatures average around 38  F  3 3  C  from mid December to mid February  54  Summers are hot and humid with a July daily average of 79 2  F  26 2  C  and average daily relative humidity around 66   which can cause medium to moderate personal discomfort  54  55  The combination of heat and humidity in the summer brings very frequent thunderstorms  some of which occasionally produce tornadoes in the area  56  Blizzards affect Washington on average once every four to six years  The most violent storms are called  nor easters   which often affect large sections of the U S  East Coast  57  Hurricanes  or their remnants  occasionally track through the area in late summer and early fall  but are often weak by the time they reach Washington  partly due to the city s inland location  58  Flooding of the Potomac River  however  caused by a combination of high tide  storm surge  and runoff  has been known to cause extensive property damage in Georgetown  59  The highest recorded temperature was 106  F  41  C  on July 20  1930  and August 6  1918  while the lowest recorded temperature was  15  F   26  C  on February 11  1899  during the Great Blizzard of 1899  54  57  During a typical year  the city averages about 37 days at or above 90  F  32 2  C  and 64 nights at or below freezing  54  v t e Climate data for Washington  D C  Month

Ellicott in 1792 Washington  D C   is a planned city  In 1791  President Washington commissioned Pierre  Peter  Charles L Enfant to design the new capital  A French born architect and city planner  L Enfant first arrived in the colonies as a military engineer during the American Revolutionary War  The L Enfant Plan for Washington featured broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles  providing room for open space and landscaping  62  He based his design on plans of cities such as Paris  Amsterdam  Karlsruhe  and Milan brought from Europe by Thomas Jefferson in 1788  63  L Enfant s design also envisioned a garden lined  grand avenue  approximately 1 mile  1 6 km  in length and 400 feet  120 m  wide in the area that is now the National Mall  64  In March 1792  President Washington dismissed L Enfant due to his insistence on micromanaging the city s planning  which had resulted in conflicts with the three commissioners appointed to supervise the capital s construction  Andrew Ellicott  who had worked with L Enfant surveying the city  was then tasked with completing the design  Though Ellicott made revisions to the original plans  including changes to some street patterns  L Enfant is still credited with the overall design of the city  65  By the start of the 20th century  L Enfant s vision of a capital with open parks and grand national monuments had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings  including a railroad station on the National Mall  62  In 1900  Congress formed a joint committee  headed by Senator James McMillan  charged with beautifying Washington s ceremonial core  What became known as the McMillan Plan was finalized in 1901  It included the re landscaping of the Capitol grounds and the Mall  constructing new federal buildings and monuments  clearing slums  and establishing a new citywide park system  Architects recruited by the committee kept much of the city s original layout  and their work is thought to have largely preserved L Enfant s intended design  62  Washington  D C   is divided into four quadrants  By law  Washington s skyline is low and sprawling  The first building height restrictions in D C  were put in place following the construction of the twelve story Cairo Apartment Building in 1894  The Heights of Buildings Act of 1910 amended the restrictions to allow buildings that are no taller than the width of the adjacent street  plus 20 feet  6 1 m   Despite popular belief  no law has ever limited buildings to the height of the United States Capitol or the 555 foot  169 m  Washington Monument  which remains the District s tallest structure  City leaders have criticized the height restriction as a primary reason why the District has limited affordable housing and traffic problems caused by urban sprawl  66  The District is divided into four quadrants of unequal area  Northwest  NW   Northeast  NE   Southeast  SE   and Southwest  SW   The axes bounding the quadrants radiate from the U S  Capitol building  67  All road names include the quadrant abbreviation to indicate their location  and house numbers are assigned based on the approximate number of blocks away from the Capitol  In most of the city  the streets are set out in a grid pattern with east west streets named with letters  e g   C Street SW  and north south streets with numbers  e g   4th Street NW   67  The City of Washington was bordered by Boundary Street to the north  renamed Florida Avenue in 1890   Rock Creek to the west  and the Anacostia River to the east  30  62  The city s streets were extended throughout the District starting in 1893  68  and Georgetown s streets were renamed in 1895  31  Some streets are particularly noteworthy  such as Pennsylvania Avenue  which connects the White House to the U S  Capitol and K Street  which houses the offices of many lobbying groups  69  Washington hosts 176 foreign embassies  70  many of which are located on a section of Massachusetts Avenue informally known as Embassy Row  71  Architecture The White House ranked second on the AIA s  List of America s Favorite Architecture  in 2007  The architecture of Washington varies greatly  Six of the top 10 buildings in the American Institute of Architects  2007 ranking of  America s Favorite Architecture  are located in the District of Columbia  72  the White House  the Washington National Cathedral  the Thomas Jefferson Memorial  the United States Capitol  the Lincoln Memorial  and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial  The neoclassical  Georgian  gothic  and modern architectural styles are all reflected among those six structures and many other prominent edifices in Washington  Notable exceptions include buildings constructed in the French Second Empire style such as the Eisenhower Executive Office Building  73  Outside downtown Washington  architectural styles are even more varied  Historic buildings are designed primarily in the Queen Anne  Ch teauesque  Richardsonian Romanesque  Georgian revival  Beaux Arts  and a variety of Victorian styles  Rowhouses are especially prominent in areas developed after the Civil War and typically follow Federalist and late Victorian designs  74  Since Georgetown was established before the city of Washington  the neighborhood features the District s oldest architecture  Georgetown s Old Stone House was built in 1765  making it the oldest standing original building in the city  75  The majority of current homes in the neighborhood  however  were not built until the 1870s and reflect late Victorian designs of the period  Founded in 1789  Georgetown University is more distinct from the neighborhood and features a mix of Romanesque and Gothic Revival architecture  73  The Ronald Reagan Building is the largest building in the District with a total area of approximately 3 1 million square feet  288 000 m2   76  Demographics Main article  Demographics of Washington  D C  Historical populations Census Pop

continues a growth trend since 2000  following a half century of population decline  78  The city was the 24th most populous place in the United States as of 2010  79  According to data from 2009  commuters from the suburbs increase the District s daytime population to over one million people  80  If the District were a state it would rank 50th in population  ahead of Wyoming  77  The Washington Metropolitan Area  which includes the District and surrounding suburbs  is the seventh largest metropolitan area in the United States with approximately 5 6 million residents as of the 2010 Census  2  When the Washington area is included with Baltimore and its suburbs  the Baltimore Washington Metropolitan Area had a population exceeding 8 5 million residents in 2010  the fourth largest combined statistical area in the country  81  According to the 2010 Census  the population of Washington  D C   was 50 7  Black or African American  38 5  White  3 5  Asian  and 0 3  Native American  Individuals from other races made up 4 1  of the District s population while individuals from two or more races made up 2 9   82  In addition  Hispanics of any race made up 9 1  of the District s population  83  About 16  of D C  residents were age 18 or younger as of 2010  lower than the U S  average of 24   However  at 34 years old  the District also had the lowest median age when compared to the 50 states  84  As of 2010  there were an estimated 81 734 foreign immigrants living in Washington  D C  85  Major sources of immigration include individuals from El Salvador  Vietnam  and Ethiopia  with a concentration of Salvadorans in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood  86  Unique among cities with a high percentage of African Americans  Washington has had a significant black population since the city s creation  This is partly a result of the manumission of slaves in the Upper South after the American Revolutionary War  The free black population in the region climbed from an estimated 1  before the war to 10  by 1810  87  By 1860  approximately 80  of the city s 11 000 African American residents were free persons  88  Black residents composed about 30  of the District s total population between 1800 and 1940  26  Row houses on Logan Circle Washington s African American population reached a peak of 70  by 1970  Since then  however  the percentage of black residents
