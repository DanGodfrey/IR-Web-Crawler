After the success of his Mandrake the Magician  the King Features newspaper syndicate asked Falk to develop a new feature  His first attempt was a strip about King Arthur and his knights  which Falk both wrote and drew  6  However  King Features turned this down  and Falk developed the idea of The Phantom  a mysterious  costumed crimefighter  He planned the first few months of the story and drew the first two weeks as a sample  Inspired by his lifelong fascination with myths and legends  such as those of King Arthur and El Cid  as well as modern fictional characters as Zorro  Tarzan  and The Jungle Book s Mowgli  Falk envisioned the Phantom s alter ego as rich playboy Jimmy Wells  fighting crime by night as the mysterious Phantom  Partway through his first story  The Singh Brotherhood  before revealling Wells was the Phantom  Falk changed the setting to jungle and made the Phantom a seemingly immortal mythic figure  7  Deciding there were already too many characters called the Phantom  including the Phantom Detective and the Phantom of the Opera   Falk had thought of calling his hero  The Gray Ghost   which later became the name of a Batman character  a fact alluded in first episode of Phantom 2040   However  Falk could not find a name he liked better and finally settled on the Phantom  8  In the A amp E American cable TV documentary The Phantom  Comic Strip Crusader  9  Falk explained Greek busts inspired the idea of the not showing the Phantom s pupils when he was wearing his mask  Ancient Greek busts displayed no pupils  which he felt gave them an inhuman  awe inspiring appearance  In an interview published in Comic Book Marketplace in 2005  10  Falk said the Phantom s skin tight costume was inspired by Robin Hood  who was shown wearing tights in films and on stage   edit  Newspaper strips The first Phantom Sunday strip  May 28  1939   Art by Ray Moore  The Phantom started as a daily strip on February 17  1936  with the story  The Singh Brotherhood   11  written by Falk and drawn first by him  for two weeks  followed by Ray Moore  who was an assistant to artist Phil Davis on Falk s Mandrake the Magician strip  A Sunday Phantom strip was added May 28  1939  12  During World War II  Falk joined the Office of War Information  where he became chief of his radio foreign language division  Moore also served in the war  during which he left the strip to his assistant Wilson McCoy  On Moore s return  he worked on the strip on and off until 1949  when McCoy succeeded him  13  During McCoy s tenure  the strip appeared in thousands of newspapers worldwide  and The Phantom strip was smuggled by boats into the Nazi occupied Norway during World War II  The word  Phantom   was also used as a password for the Norwegian Resistance  leading the character to receive iconic status in the country  14  McCoy died suddenly in 1961  Carmine Infantino and Bill Lignante  who would later draw several Phantom stories directly for comic books  filled in before a successor was found in Sy Barry  15  During Barry s early years  he and Falk modernized the strip  and laid the foundation for what is considered the modern look of the Phantom  Barry s tenure would see Bengalla turned into a democracy  with the character of President Lamanda Luaga being introduced  Barry would continue working on the strip for over 30 years before retiring in 1994  having drawn around 11 000 Phantom strips in total  16  Barry s longtime assistant George Olesen remained on the strip as penciller  with Keith Williams joining as inker for the daily strip  The Sunday strip was inked by Eric Doescher until Fred Fredericks became the regular inker in 1995  Falk continued to script Phantom  and Mandrake  until his death on March 13  1999  His last daily and Sunday strip stories   Terror at the Opera  and  The Kidnappers   respectively  were finished by his wife  Elizabeth Falk  after the hospitalized Falk had literally torn off his oxygen mask to dictate the adventures  17  After Falk s passing  King Features Syndicate began to cooperate with European comic publisher Egmont  publisher of the Swedish Fantomen magazine  which now went from only publishing Phantom stories in licenced comic books to providing the stories for the newspaper strip as well  by adapting their own Phantom comic book stories into the comic strip format  Fantomen writers Tony De Paul and Claes Reimerthi alternated as writers of the newspaper strip after Falk died  with De Paul handling the daily strips and Reimerthi being responsible for the Sunday strips  De Paul would later assume duties as the sole writer of the strip  Some stories have been adapted from comic magazine stories originally published in Fantomen  15  Phantom daily strip from 2005  Art by Paul Ryan In 2000  Olesen and Fredericks retired from the Sunday strip which was then taken over by respected comic book artist Graham Nolan  who had previously drawn three covers for issues of Fantomen  A few years later  Olesen and Williams left the daily strip after Olesen decided to retire and artist Paul Ryan  who had worked on the Fantomen comic stories and had been a fan of the character since childhood  took over the daily strip in early 2005  Ryan succeeded Nolan as artist on the Sunday strip in 2007  18  On Sunday July 31  2011  Eduardo Barreto became the Phantom Sunday page artist  Barreto died after only a few months of working on the strip however  and Ryan temporarily took over the Sunday page duties again starting with the January 15  2012 edition  which carried a memoriam for Barreto  The following week s strip was also handled by Ryan  before Terry Beatty became Barreto s permanent replacement  The Phantom is one of few adventure comic strips still published today   edit  Fictional character biography In the jungles of the fictional African country of Bangalla  there is a myth featuring The Ghost Who Walks  a powerful and indestructible guardian of the innocent and fighter of all types of injustice  Because he seems to have existed for generations  many believe him to be immortal  In reality  the Phantom is a Legacy Hero  descended from 20 previous generations of crime fighters who all adopt the same persona  When a new Phantom takes the task from his dying father  he swears the Oath of the Skull   I swear to devote my life to the destruction of piracy  greed  cruelty  and injustice  in all their forms  and my sons and their sons shall follow me   The first Phantom married Christina  the daughter of a Scandinavian sea captain  Eric the Rover  The second Phantom married Marabella  the granddaughter of Christopher Columbus  19   The comic sometimes runs flashback adventures of previous Phantoms written by various authors who sometimes confuse Phantom history  Current stories have Marabella as the daughter of Columbus and marrying the first Phantom  20  21  As Columbus died in 1506 while  according to the new history  Marabella first meets the Phantom in 1544  this results in another inconsistency  requiring her to be at least 38 years old despite being depicted as in her early 20s  Inconsistencies in storylines and histories are not corrected as a mark of respect to authors  but Falk s original history takes precedence  22   The Phantom of the present is the 21st in the line  Unlike most costumed heroes  he has no superhuman powers  relying only on his wits  physical strength  skill with his weapons  and fearsome reputation to fight crime  His real name is Kit Walker  References to  Mr  Walker  are in the strip often accompanied by a footnote saying  For  The Ghost Who Walks    although some versions of the Phantom s history suggest that Walker was actually the original surname of the man who became the first Phantom  Promotional Skull Evil Mark Ring from  The Phantom  starring Billy Zane A signature of the character is his two rings  One has a pattern formed like four crossing sabres   The Good Mark   that he leaves on visitors whom he befriends  placing the person under his protection  The other   The Evil Mark  or  Skull Mark  has a skull shape  which leaves a scar of the corresponding shape on the enemies he punches with it  He wears the Good mark on his left hand because it is closer to the heart  and the Evil Mark on his right hand  The Skull Ring was given to the first Phantom by Paracelsus  The original owner of the Skull Ring was Emperor Nero of the Roman empire and it would later be revealed that the ring had been made from the nails that hung Jesus to the cross  The Good Mark ring was made after the sixth Phantom founded the Jungle Patrol  23  His base is in the Deep Woods of Bengali  originally  Bengalla   or  Bangalla  and renamed Denkali in the Indian edition 24    a fictional country initially said to be set in Asia  near India  but depicted as in Africa during and after the 1960s  The Phantom s base is the fabled Skull Cave  where all previous Phantoms are buried  For a period of time  he also lived with his family in a tree house built by the Rope People   a tribe he had assisted  The Phantom has an Isle of Eden in which he has trained animals that are natural enemies to live in harmony  a Mesa in America called Walker s Table and a castle in the Old World  The Phantom is the commander of Bangalla s world famous Jungle Patrol  who never know his name but answer consistently to his orders  25  Due to a betrayal leading to the death of the 14th Phantom  the identity of the commander has been kept hidden from members of the patrol ever since  The Phantom uses several ways to stay in contact  These include radio and a safe with a false bottom  On a few rare occasions the Phantom has also visited the patrol wearing his patrol uniform  The sixth Phantom originally formed the Jungle Patrol with the help of former pirate Redbeard and his men back in 1664  26  Another character who has aided the modern day Phantom is Guran  chief of the local pygmy tribe  who are the only tribe to know his true nature  Guran is the Phantom s best friend since childhood  and a supporter of his cause  Map of countries printing The Phantom  Green countries have regular Phantom publications  while blue countries print the dailies Sundays in newspapers  The Phantom has two helpers  a mountain wolf called Devil  and a horse named Hero  He also has a trained falcon named Fraka  From 1962 on  The Phantom raised an orphan named Rex King  who was later on revealed to be the prince of the kingdom of Baronkhan  He also has two dolphins named Solomon and Nefertiti  and numerous other animals kept on the island of Eden  In 1978  he married his sweetheart since his days in American college  Diana Palmer  who works at the United Nations  Guran  his best friend since boyhood  was best man  The guests present at the wedding included President Luaga of Bengalla  President Goranda of Ivory Lana  and Mandrake the Magician  the Phantom would later be a guest at Mandrake s wedding when he married in 1997   A year later  twins were born to the Palmer Walkers  Kit and Heloise  The Phantom s family have always played a significant role in the series  His romance with Diana Palmer was an ongoing part of the story from the beginning  and many later stories revolved around the Phantom becoming involved in adventures as a result of young charges including his children  When the Phantom leaves the jungle  he frequently dresses in a fedora  a trench coat  and sunglasses  The Phantom usually does not allow his unmasked or undisguised face to be seen except by close friends or members of his family  Even readers of the comic have never been shown the Phantom s unmasked face clearly   edit  Origin The story of the Phantom started with a young sailor named Christopher Walker  sometimes called Christopher Standish in certain versions of the story 27    Christopher was born in 1516 in Portsmouth  28  His father  also named Christopher Walker  had been a seaman since he was a young boy  and was the cabin boy on Christopher Columbus s ship Santa Mar a when he sailed to the Americas  Christopher Jr  became a shipboy on his father s ship in 1526  of which Christopher Sr  was Captain  In 1536  when Christopher was 20 years old  he was a part of what was supposed to be his father s last voyage  On February 17  the ship was attacked by pirates of the Singh Brotherhood in a bay on the coast of Bengalla  The last thing Christopher saw before he fell unconscious and into the sea was his father being murdered by the leader of the pirates  Both ships exploded  making Christopher the sole survivor of the attack  Christopher was washed ashore on a Bengalla beach  seemingly half dead  He was found by pygmies of the Bandar tribe  who nursed him and took care of him  29  Some time later  Christopher took a walk on the same beach  and found a dead body there  whom he recognized as the pirate who killed his father  He allowed the vultures flying around the body to eat its meat  took up the skull of the killer  raised it above his head  and swore an oath   I swear to devote my life to the destruction of piracy  greed  cruelty  and injustice  in all their forms  My sons and their sons shall follow me   30  After learning the language of the Bandar tribe  Christopher learned that the majority of their people were slaves of the Wasaka  a tribe consisting of what the Bandars called  giants   Immediately  Christopher walked into the village of the Wasaka  and asked them to set the Bandars free  He was taken prisoner and laid before the Demon God of the Wasaka  Uzuki  31  who was supposed to decide his destiny  Christopher was tied up and laid on an altar made of stone  where vultures surrounded him  Christopher was quickly saved by a group of Bandar before the vultures or the Wasaka could do him any real harm  They managed to escape from the village of the Wasaka unharmed  Christopher later learned of a Bandar prophecy that featured a man coming from the ocean to save them from their slavery  He made a costume inspired by the look of the Demon God of the Wasaka and went to the Wasaka village again  this time with a small army of Bandar armed with their newly discovered poisoned arrows  which were capable of killing a man in a few seconds  The Wasaka  shocked at seeing what many of them thought was their Demon God come alive  were fought down  and the Bandars were finally set free after centuries in slavery  This resulted in a dedicated friendship between Christopher and the Bandars  which would be continued in the generations to come after them  The Bandars showed Christopher to a cave  which resembled a human skull in appearance  Christopher later carved the features out to enhance this  This Skull Cave became his home  Wearing the costume based on the Demon God  Christopher became the first of what would later be known as the Phantom  When he died  his son took over for him  when the second Phantom died  his son took over  So it would go on through the centuries  causing people to believe that the Phantom was immortal  These people gave him nicknames including  The Ghost Who Walks  and  The Man Who Cannot Die   32   edit  Mythos Over the course of more than seventy years  worth of stories  the back story  legend  of the Phantom grew to become an integral part of the series  The legend of the  Ghost Who Walks  made the character stand out from the innumerable costumed heroes who have battled crime throughout the 20th century  and helped maintain his appeal through to the present day  Much of the underlying  continuing plots and  themes  of the series focus on the continuing legend of the Phantom  The series regularly quotes the  old jungle sayings  surrounding the myth of the Phantom  33  Perhaps the most well known of these is the tradition that anyone who sees the Phantom s true face without his mask will certainly  die a terrible death   Not all stories were set in present time  but included earlier generations  While the costumes looked the same  the weaponry varied with the age  such as revolvers and pirate flintlocks  The Phantom is feared by criminals over the entire world and knows how to use his frightening image against them   edit  Kit Walker  the 21st Phantom The 21st Phantom  drawn by Jerry DeCaire The 21st Phantom s birth name is Kit Walker  as was the name of many of the Phantoms before him  Kit was born in the Skull Cave  and spent his first years in the jungle of Bengalla  His mother  Maud Thorne McPatrick  who had previously worked as Rita Hayworth s stunt double  was born in Mississippi  where Kit went to study when he was 12 years old  living with his aunt Lucy and uncle Jasper in the town of Clarksville  Here he met his wife to be  Diana Palmer  Kit was an extremely talented sportsman and was predicted to become the world champion of many different events  even knocking out the world heavyweight boxing champion in a sparring match when the champion visited Clarksville   Despite the opportunity to choose practically any career he wanted  Kit faithfully returned to Bengalla to take over the role of the Phantom when he received word from Guran that his father was dying from a knife wound  34  One of Kit s first missions as the Phantom was to find his father s killer  Rama Singh  who had betrayed and murdered the 20th Phantom by first helping him to blow up a fleet of ships owned by the Singh Brotherhood  only to then stab him in the back  stealing his special gunbelt in the process  The 21st Phantom eventually found him and reclaimed the belt at the island of Gullique  but before he could avenge his father and bring the killer to jail  the desperate Rama blew up his lair  killing himself and his henchmen in the process  35   edit  Costume and weapons As part of the official uniform  the Phantom wears a black mask and a purple skintight bodysuit  He also carries period appropriate sidearms  currently two M1911 pistols  36  in a special belt with a skull like buckle  Falk has insisted that the Phantom only uses his guns to shoot out the guns of his opponents  a fact that writer Peter David was unaware of when he wrote DC Comics  1988 four issue Phantom miniseries  in which he had the Phantom shoot to wound his enemies  37  However  there are some early instances of the Phantom using his guns to shoot and kill people  sometimes in self defence   While there had been masked crime fighters like the costumed Zorro or the business suited The Clock  the Phantom was the first fictional character to wear the skintight costume and eyes with no visible pupils that has become a trademark of superheroes  Creator Lee Falk had originally envisioned a grey costume and even considered naming his creation  The Gray Ghost   It was not until the Phantom Sunday strip debuted in 1939 that the costume was shown to be purple  Falk  however  continued to refer to the costume as gray in the text of the strip on several occasions afterward  but finally accepted the purple color  38  In a Sunday strip story published in the 1960s it was shown that the first Phantom chose the costume based on the appearance of a jungle idol  and colored the cloth with purple jungle berries  As part of a modernization of the character in Moonstone Books  series The Phantom  Ghost Who Walks  the Phantom began wearing a costume made of kevlar  39  The Phantom s costume is colored blue in Scandinavia  red in Italy  Turkey  and formerly in Brazil  citation needed   edit  Enemies Given his oath to fight all evil in the world  The Phantom faces a vast array of villains  The most dangerous and lasting enemy of the Phantom is the Singh Brotherhood  which have been active for centuries and were responsible for the pirate attack that resulted in the death of Christopher Standish s father and the beginning of the Phantom legacy  In Egmont s Phantom comics  the brotherhood has evolved from merely being pirates into a modern company called Singh Corporations  led by Sandal Singh  who is the daughter of former leader Dogai Singh and also the current President of Bengalla  Another major threat against the Phantom and his country was Kigali Lubanga  the President of Bengalla for several years  Other recurring villainous characters are General Bababu  The Python  Manuel Ortega  Ali Gutalee  Goldhand  Bail  HIM and   in the movie   Xander Drax  The Phantom has also fought numerous crime organizations such as the Sky Band  the Vultures  Hydra and The Flame   edit  Comic books  edit  United States DC Comics  The Phantom vol  2   2  April 1989   Cover art by Luke McDonnell  In the United States the Phantom has been published

by Peter David and drawn by Joe Orlando and Dennis Janke  The subsequent series  written by Mark Verheiden and drawn by Luke McDonnell  lasted 13 issues  March 1989   March 1990   41  It depicted the Phantom fighting such issues as racism  toxic dumping  hunger  and modern day piracy  According to Verheiden  the series ended because of licencing issues as much as dropping sales  42  The final panels of issue 13 saw the Phantom marrying Diana  In 1987  Marvel Comics did a four issue miniseries based on the Defenders of the Earth TV series  written by Stan Lee  Another three issue Marvel miniseries  The Phantom  The Ghost Who Walks  Feb  April 1995  followed  written and drawn by David de Vries and Glenn Lumsden  it featured the 22nd Phantom  with an updated  high tech costume  Marvel

Man signature artists  Ditko and John Romita  Sr  Moonstone Books  The Phantom  12 cover by Joe Prado  The gadgets used by Marvel s 22nd Phantom were slightly reminiscent of those in Phantom 2040  only less advanced  For instance  while the 2040 Phantom had a talking artificial intelligence built into one of his wristbands  the 22nd s wristband contained a sophisticated  but clearly present day  palmtop computer  Moonstone Books published Phantom graphic novels beginning in 2002  Five books  written by Tom DeFalco  Ben Raab  and Ron Goulart  were published  In 2003  Moonstone debuted a

published a retcon of the Phantom s origin  called Legacy  by Raab and Quinn  That same year  the company published a hybrid comic book and prose book it called  wide vision   premiering the format

Moonstone re launched the series as The Phantom  Ghost Who Walks  starting with issue 0  a retelling of the origin of the first Phantom  The goal of this launch was to make the comic darker  grittier and more realistic  like the stories of Lee Falk and Ray Moore from the 1930s  It also updated the character of the Phantom by giving him more modern day accessories  and introduced many supporting characters and villains  The Phantom frequently fights reality based enemies in the series  such as modern day terrorists  organ smugglers and Somalian pirates  45  2009 would see Moonstone Books

was made in 1943  with Jeanne Bates as Diana Palmer  Frank Shannon as her uncle Professor Davidson  and Ace the Wonder Dog as Devil  The story shows the 21st Phantom s first mission after taking over the mantle of the Ghost Who Walks from his murdered father  to find the Lost City of Zoloz and prevent the evil Dr  Bremmer  played by Kenneth MacDonald  from building a secret airbase in the jungle  The Phantom s real name in the serial was Geoffrey Prescott  as the alias of Kit Walker had not been mentioned in the strip at that point  However  he goes by the alias of Mr  Walker after having become the Phantom  Two episodes loosely adapted Lee Falk s story  The Fire Princess  for the screen  and fit it into the plot of the Phantom s fight against Dr  Bremmer  The serial was a success  62  and a sequel  to be called Return of the Phantom  was filmed in 1955 starring John Hart  but after problems with the rights to the character it was partially re shot and re named The Adventures of Captain Africa  63  Teaser poster to The Phantom movie  1996    edit  The Phantom  1996  Main article  The Phantom  1996 film  The Phantom was also adapted into a live action movie in 1996  Produced and released by Paramount Pictures  the movie was set in the 1930s  and incorporated elements from several of the Phantom s earliest comic strip adventures  It starred Billy Zane in the title role  Kristy Swanson as Diana Palmer  and Catherine Zeta Jones as Sala  an aviatrix  It was directed by Simon Wincer  after director Joe Dante and producer Michael Douglas dropped out of the project  64  and was written by Jeffrey Boam  who also wrote Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  Cult icon Bruce Campbell was another choice for the role  65  but Zane  already a huge fan of the comic strip since being introduced to Australian Frew comics on the set of Dead Calm  ended up getting the part after actively lobbying for it for years  After his casting  he feverishly pumped iron for a year and a half to fill the Phantom s costume  refusing to wear a Batman like costume with moulded muscles  He also closely studied panels of the comic to capture the character s body language  Though the film did not become a success in its theatrical release  it was the reason why Zane was cast as Caledon Hockley in Titanic  the world s second most commercially successful film  66  and has sold well on VHS and DVD  67  The movie was filmed on location in Australia  Thailand  and in Los Angeles  and featured the Phantom in his attempt to stop madman Xander Drax  Treat Williams  from obtaining a weapon of doom  the legendary  Skulls of Touganda   The story also features the Singh Brotherhood  the all female clan of air pirates known as the Sky Band  of whom Sala is the leader and a subplot

The Singh Brotherhood   the first Phantom story  and its 1937 continuation  The Sky Band   68  In 2008  syndicated gossip columnist Liz Smith claimed that Paramount was putting a sequel into

executive producer and head of Sherlock Symington Productions  said that The Phantom  Legacy would follow the lead of films like The Dark Knight and Iron Man  and present a serious treatment of the character  The film will be set in the present day  and revolves around the relationship between the Phantom and his son  and what it means to be the Phantom  Work on the film is expected to begin in 2009  The movie will be filmed in Australia  and producers are in talks with both Australian and international actors to work on the film  71  In an interview with Dark Horizons  Boyle said the film will feature two main antagonists  one taken from the comic and one created for the movie  The Phantom s costume is also expected to be updated for the screen  with Boyle seeking to make it more reality based  72  Characters such as Diana Palmer  Kit and Heloise Walker  Colonel Worubu  President Lamanda Luaga  and Guran will also appear  The film is said to be heavily focused on the mythology of the comics  with the origin of the 1st Phantom expected to be devoted a lot of screen time  The Phantom s eyes behind his mask will also be white  unlike what it has been in previous film versions

make an imprint on someone when you punch them while wearing it  as it does in the comic  The result was the myth was  busted   in that hitting a person in the face hard enough to leave a ring imprint
