3D film From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Redirected from 3 D movie  Jump to  navigation  search For more information on 3D film titles  see List of 3 D films  A 3 D  three dimensional  film or S3D  stereoscopic 3D  film 1  is a motion picture that enhances the illusion of depth perception  Derived from stereoscopic photography  a regular motion picture camera system is used to record the images as seen from two perspectives  or computer generated imagery generates the two perspectives in post production   and special projection hardware and or eyewear are used to provide the illusion of depth when viewing the film  3 D films are not limited to feature film theatrical releases  television broadcasts and direct to video films have also incorporated similar methods  primarily for marketing purposes  3 D films have existed in some form since 1915  but had been largely relegated to a niche in the motion picture industry because of the costly hardware and processes required to produce and display a 3 D film  and the lack of a standardized format for all segments of the entertainment business  Nonetheless  3 D films were prominently featured in the 1950s in American cinema  and later experienced a worldwide resurgence in the 1980s and 1990s driven by IMAX high end theaters and Disney themed venues  3 D films became more and more successful throughout the 2000s  culminating in the unprecedented success of 3 D presentations of Avatar in December 2009 and January 2010  Contents 1 Techniques 1 1 Anaglyph 1 2 Polarization systems 1 3 Eclipse method 1 4

methods  Over the years the popularity of systems being widely employed in movie theaters has waxed and waned  Though anaglyph  see next section  was sometimes used prior to 1948  during the early  Golden Era  of 3 D cinematography of the 1950s the polarization system was used for every single feature length movie in the United states  and all but one short film  2  In the 21st century  polarization 3 D systems have continued to dominate the scene  though during the 1960s and 1970s some classic films which were converted to anaglyph for theaters not equipped for polarization  and were even shown in 3 D on television  3  In the years following the mid 1980s  some movies were made with short segments in anaglyph 3D  The following are some of the technical details and methodologies employed in some of the more notable 3 D movie systems that have been developed   edit  Anaglyph The archetypical 3 D glasses  with modern red and cyan color filters  similar to the red green and red blue lenses used to view early anaglyph films  Anaglyph images were the earliest method of presenting theatrical 3 D  and the one most commonly associated with stereoscopy by the public at large  mostly because of non theatrical 3D media such as comic books and 3D television broadcasts  where polarization is not practical  They were made popular because of the ease of their production and exhibition  The first anaglyph movie was invented in 1915  Though the earliest theatrical presentations were done with this system  most 3D movies from the 1950s and 1980s were originally shown polarized  4  In an anaglyph  the two images are superimposed in an additive light setting through two filters  one red and one cyan  In a subtractive light setting  the two images are printed in the same complementary colors on white paper  Glasses with colored filters in each eye separate the appropriate images by canceling the filter color out and rendering the complementary color black  Anaglyph images are much easier to view than either parallel sighting or crossed eye stereograms  although the latter types offer bright and accurate color rendering  particularly in the red component  which is muted  or desaturated with even the best color anaglyphs  A compensating technique  commonly known as Anachrome  uses a slightly more transparent cyan filter in the patented glasses associated with the technique  Process reconfigures the typical anaglyph image to have less parallax  An alternative to the usual red and cyan filter system of anaglyph is ColorCode 3 D  a patented anaglyph system which was invented in order to present an anaglyph image in conjunction with the NTSC television standard  in which the red channel is often compromised  ColorCode uses the complementary colors of yellow and dark blue on screen  and the colors of the glasses  lenses are amber and dark blue  The anaglyph 3 D system was the earliest system used in theatrical presentations and requires less specialized hardware  The polarization 3 D system has been the standard for theatrical presentations since it was used for Bwana Devil in 1952  4  though early Imax presentations were done using the eclipse system and in the 1960s and 1970s classic 3D movies were sometimes converted to anaglyph for special presentations  The polarization system has better color fidelity and less ghosting than the anaglyph system  In the post  50s era  anaglyph has been used instead of polarization in feature presentations where only part of the movie is in 3D such as in the 3D segment of Freddy s Dead  The Final Nightmare and the 3D segments of Spy Kids 3D  Anaglyph is also used in printed materials and in 3D television broadcasts where polarization is not practical  3D polarized televisions and other displays only became available from several manufacturers in 2008  these generate polarization on the receiving end   edit  Polarization systems cardboard 3D linear polarized glasses from the 1980s similar to those used in the 1950s  Though some were plain white  they often had the name of the theatre and or graphics from the movie Further information  Polarized 3D glasses To present a stereoscopic motion picture  two images are projected superimposed onto the same screen through different polarizing filters  The viewer wears low cost eyeglasses which also contain a pair of polarizing filters oriented differently  clockwise counterclockwise with circular polarization or at 90 degree angles  usually 45 and 135 degrees  5  with linear polarization   As each filter passes only that light which is similarly polarized and blocks the light polarized differently  each eye sees a different image  This is used to produce a three dimensional effect by projecting the same scene into both eyes  but depicted from slightly different perspectives  Since no head tracking is involved  the entire audience can view the stereoscopic images at the same time  Additionally  since both lenses have the same color  people with one dominant eye  amblyopia   where one eye is used more  are able to see the 3D effect  previously negated by the separation of the two colors  Resembling sunglasses  RealD circular polarized glasses are now the standard for theatrical releases and theme park attractions  Circular polarization has an advantage over linear polarization  in that the viewer does not need to have their head upright and aligned with the screen for the polarization to work properly  With linear polarization  turning the glasses sideways causes the filters to go out of alignment with the screen filters causing the image to fade and for each eye to see the opposite frame more easily  For circular polarization  the polarizing effect works regardless of how the viewer s head is aligned with the screen such as tilted sideways  or even upside down  The left eye will still only see the image intended for it  and vice versa  without fading or crosstalk  In the case of RealD a circularly polarizing liquid crystal filter which can switch polarity 144 times per second is placed in front of the projector lens  Only one projector is needed  as the left and right eye images are displayed alternately  Sony features a new system called RealD XLS  which shows both circular polarized images simultaneously  A single 4K projector  4096 2160 resolution  displays both 2K images  2048 858 resolution  on top of each other at the same time  a special lens attachment polarizes and projects the images  6  Thomson Technicolor has produced a system using a split lens which allows traditional 35mm projectors to be adapted to project in 3D using over under 35 mm film  This is a very cost effective way to convert a screen as all that is needed is the lens and metallic  silver  screen rather than converting entirely to digital  7  A metallic screen is necessary for these systems as reflection from non metallic surfaces destroys the polarization of the light  Polarized stereoscopic pictures have been around since 1936  when Edwin H  Land first applied it to motion pictures  The so called  3 D movie craze  in the years 1952 through 1955 was almost entirely offered in theaters using linear polarizing projection and glasses  Only a minute amount of the total 3D films shown in the period used the anaglyph color filter method  Linear polarization was likewise used with consumer level stereo projectors  Polarization was also used during the 3D revival of the 1980s  In the 2000s  computer animation  competition from DVDs and other media  digital projection  and the use of sophisticated IMAX 70mm film projectors  have created an opportunity for a new wave of polarized 3D films  8  9  All types of polarization will result in a darkening of the displayed image and poorer contrast compared to non 3D images  Light from lamps is normally emitted as a random collection of polarizations  while a polarization filter only passes a fraction of the light  As a result the screen image is darker  This darkening can be compensated by increasing the brightness of the projector light source  If the initial polarization filter is inserted between the lamp and the image generation element  the light intensity striking the image element is not any higher than normal without the polarizing filter  and overall image contrast transmitted to the screen is not affected   edit  Eclipse method With the eclipse method  a shutter blocks light from each appropriate eye when the converse eye s image is projected on the screen  The projector alternates between left and right images  and opens and closes the shutters in the glasses or viewer in synchronization with the images on the screen  This was the basis of the Teleview system which was used briefly in 1922  10  11  A pair of LCD shutter glasses used to view XpanD 3D films  The thick frames conceal the electronics and batteries  A variation on the eclipse method is used in LCD shutter glasses  Glasses containing liquid crystal that will let light through in synchronization with the images on the cinema  television or computer screen  using the concept of alternate frame sequencing  This is the method used by nVidia  XpanD 3D  and earlier IMAX systems  A drawback of this method is the need for each person viewing to wear expensive  electronic glasses that must be synchronized with the display system using a wireless signal or attached wire  The shutter glasses are heavier than most polarized glasses  though lighter models are no heavier than some sunglasses or deluxe polarized glasses  12  However these systems do not require a silver screen for projected images  Liquid crystal light valves work by rotating light between two polarizing filters  Due to these internal polarizers  LCD shutter glasses darken the display image of any LCD  plasma  or projector image source  which has the result that images appear dimmer and contrast is lower than for normal non 3D viewing  This is not necessarily a usage problem  for some types of displays which are already very bright with poor grayish black levels  LCD shutter glasses may actually improve the image quality   edit  Interference filter technology Dolby 3D uses specific wavelengths of red  green  and blue for the right eye  and different wavelengths of red  green  and blue for the left eye  Eyeglasses which filter out the very specific wavelengths allow the wearer to see a 3D image  This technology eliminates the expensive silver screens required for polarized systems such as RealD  which is the most common 3D display system in theaters  It does  however  require much more expensive glasses than the polarized systems  It is also known as spectral comb filtering or wavelength multiplex visualization The recently introduced Panavision 3D system also uses this technology  though with a wider spectrum and more  teeth  to the  comb   5 for each eye in the Panavision system   The use of more spectral bands per eye eliminates the need for color processing of the image that the infitech   Dolby system requires  by evenly dividing the visible spectrum between the eyes gives the viewer a more relaxed  feel  as the light energy and color balance is nearly 50 50  like the infitech system Panavision can be used on white or silver screens but Panavision can be used on a film projector as well as digital unlike the infitech filters that can only be on a digital system with a color correcting processor provided by Dolby  Panavision also claim that their glasses are cheaper to manufacture than those used by Dolby  13   edit  Pulfrich The Pulfrich effect is based on the phenomenon of the human eye processing images more slowly when there is less light  as when looking through a dark lens  Imagine a camera which starts at position X and moves right to position Y as shown by the arrow  If a viewer watches this segment with a dark lens over the left eye  then when the right eye sees the image recorded when the camera is at Y  the left eye will be a few milliseconds behind and will still be seeing the image recorded at X  thus creating the necessary parallax to generate right and left eye views and 3D perception  much the same as when still pictures are generated by shifting a single camera  The intensity of this effect will depend on how fast the camera is moving relative to the distance to the objects  greater speed creates greater parallax  A similar effect can be achieved by using a stationary camera and continuously rotating an otherwise stationary object  If the movement stops  the eye looking through the dark lens  which could be either eye depending on the direction the camera is moving  will  catch up  and the effect will disappear  One advantage of this system is that people not wearing the glasses will see a perfectly normal picture  Of course  incidental movement of objects will create spurious artifacts  and these incidental effects will be seen as artificial depth not related to actual depth in the scene  Unfortunately  many of the applications of pulfrich involve deliberately causing just this sort of effect and this has given the technique a bad reputation  When the only movement is lateral movement of the camera then the effect is as real as any other form of stereoscopy  but this seldom happens except in highly contrived situations  Though pulfrich has been used often on television and in computer games  it is rarely if ever used in theatrical presentations   edit  Spectral separation ChromaDepth uses a holographic film in the glasses that creates an effect like a dispersive prism  This causes redder objects to be perceived as near and bluer objects as farther away   edit  Lenticular or barrier screens Comparison of parallax barrier and lenticular autostereoscopic displays  Note  The figure is not to scale  Lenticules can be modified and more pixels can be used to make automultiscopic displays Lenticular printing and parallax barrier technologies involve imposing two  or more  images on the same sheet  in narrow  alternating strips  and using a screen that either blocks one of the two images  strips  in the case of parallax barriers  or uses equally narrow lenses to bend the strips of image and make it appear to fill the entire image  in the case of lenticular prints   To produce the stereostopic effect  the person must be positioned so that one eye sees one of the two images and the other sees the other  In this method  glasses are not necessary to see the stereoscopic image  Both images are projected onto a high gain  corrugated screen which reflects light at acute angles  In order to see the stereoscopic image  the viewer must sit within a very narrow angle that is nearly perpendicular to the screen  limiting the size of the audience  Lenticular was used for theatrical presentation of numerous shorts in Russia from 1940 1948 3  and in 1954 for the feature length films Crystal  Machine 22 12 and The Pencil on Ice  14  Though its use in theatrical presentations has been rather limited  lenticular has been widely used for a variety of novelty items and has even been used in amateur 3D photography  15  16   edit  New systems without glasses There is increasing emergence of new 3 D viewing systems which do not require the use of special viewing glasses  These systems are referred to as Autostereoscopic displays  They were initially developed by Sharp  The first Autostereoscopic LCD displays first appeared on the Sharp Actius RD3D notebook 17  and the first LCD monitor was shipped by Sharp in 2004 for the professional market  18  Both have since been discontinued  The first Autostereoscopic mobile phone was launched by Hitachi in 2009 in Japan and in 2010 China mobile is to launch its version  Manufacturing trials are being run for television  The first digital camera to feature an autostereoscopic display was the Fujifilm FinePix REAL 3D W1 released in 2009  The W3 model was released one year later  For the gaming market the first probable commercial application was handheld gaming devices  such as the Nintendo 3DS  These systems do not yet appear to be applicable to theatrical presentations   edit  History This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding

British film pioneer William Friese Greene filed a patent for a 3 D movie process  In his patent  two films were projected side by side on screen  The viewer looked through a stereoscope to converge the two images  Because of the obtrusive mechanics behind this method  theatrical use was not practical  19 Frederic Eugene Ives patented his stereo camera rig in 1900  The camera had two lenses coupled together 1 3 4 inches apart  20  On June 10  1915  Edwin S  Porter and William E  Waddell presented tests to an audience at the Astor Theater in New York City  In red green anaglyph  the audience was presented three reels of tests  which included rural scenes  test shots of Marie Doro  a segment of John Mason playing a number of passages from Jim the Penman  a film released by Famous Players Lasky that year  but not in 3 D   Oriental dancers  and a reel of footage of Niagara Falls  21  However  according to Adolph Zukor in his 1953 autobiography The Public Is Never Wrong  My 50 Years in the Motion Picture Industry  nothing was produced in this process after these tests   edit  Early systems of stereoscopic filmmaking  pre 1952  The earliest confirmed 3 D film shown to a paying audience was The Power of Love  which premiered at the Ambassador Hotel Theater in Los Angeles on 27 September 1922  22  23  24  The camera rig was a product of the film s producer  Harry K  Fairall  and cinematographer Robert F  Elder  19  It was projected dual strip in the red green anaglyph format  making it both the earliest known film that utilized dual strip projection and the earliest known film in which anaglyph glasses were used  25  Whether Fairall used colored filters on the projection ports or whether he used tinted prints is unknown  After a preview for exhibitors and press in New York City  the film dropped out of sight  apparently not booked by exhibitors  and is now considered lost  Early in December 1922  William Van Doren Kelley  inventor of the Prizma color system  cashed in on the growing interest in 3 D films started by Fairall s demonstration and shot footage with a camera system of his own design  Kelley then struck a deal with Samuel  Roxy  Rothafel to premiere the first in his series of  Plasticon  shorts entitled Movies of the Future at the Rivoli Theater in New York City   26  Also in December 1922  Laurens Hammond  later inventor of the Hammond organ  and William F  Cassidy unveiled their Teleview system  Teleview was the earliest alternate frame sequencing form of film projection  Through the use of two interlocked projectors  alternating left right frames were projected one after another in rapid succession  Synchronized viewers attached to the arm rests of the seats in the theater open and closed at the same time  and took advantage of the viewer s persistence of vision  thereby creating a true stereoscopic image  The only theater known to have installed this system was the Selwyn Theater in New York  Only one show was ever produced for the system  a groups of shorts and the only Teleview feature The Man From M A R S   later re released as Radio Mania  on December 27  1922 in New York City  11  In 1922  Frederic Eugene Ives and Jacob Leventhal began releasing their first stereoscopic shorts made over a three year period  The first film entitled  Plastigrams  which was distributed nationally by Educational Pictures in the red blue anaglyph format  Ives and Leventhal then went on to produce the following stereoscopic shorts in the  Stereoscopiks Series  for Path  Films in 1925  Zowie  April 10   Luna cy   May 18   The Run Away Taxi  December 17  and Ouch  December 17   27  On 22 September 1924  Luna cy  was re released in the DeForest Phonofilm sound on film system  28  The late 1920s to early 1930s saw little to no interest in stereoscopic pictures  largely due to the Great Depression  In Paris  Louis Lumiere shot footage with his stereoscopic camera in September 1933  The following year  in March 1934  he premiered his remake of his 1895 film L Arriv e du Train  this time in anaglyphic 3 D  at a meeting of the French Academy of Science  29  Two 30 minute Nazi propaganda films shot in 3D in Germany in 1936 were found in Berlin s Federal Archives in 2011  The Australian documentary maker Philippe Mora is convinced there is more unseen 3D footage yet to be found  30  In 1936  Leventhal and John Norling were hired based on their test footage to film MGM s Audioscopiks series  The prints were by Technicolor in the red green anaglyph format  and were narrated by Pete Smith  The first film  Audioscopiks  premiered January 11  1936 and The New Audioscopiks premiered January 15  1938  Audioscopiks was nominated for the Academy Award in the category Best Short Subject  Novelty in 1936  With the success of the two Audioscopiks films  MGM produced one more short in anaglyph 3 D  another Pete Smith Specialty called Third Dimensional Murder  1941   Unlike its predecessors  this short was shot with a studio built camera rig  Prints were by Technicolor in red blue anaglyph  The short is notable for being one of the few live action appearances of the Frankenstein Monster as conceived by Jack Pierce for Universal Studios outside of their company  While many of these films were printed by color systems  none of them was actually in color  and the use of the color printing was only to achieve an anaglyph effect   edit  Introduction of Polaroid While attending Harvard University  Edwin H  Land conceived the idea of reducing glare by polarizing light  He took a leave of absence from Harvard to set up a lab and by 1929 had invented and patented a polarizing sheet  31  In 1932  he introduced Polaroid J Sheet as a commercial product  32  While his original intention was to create a filter for reducing glare from car headlights  Land did not underestimate the utility of his newly dubbed Polaroid filters in stereoscopic presentations  In January 1936  Land gave the first demonstration of Polaroid filters in conjunction with 3 D photography at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel  citation needed  The reaction was enthusiastic  and he followed it up with an installation at the New York Museum of Science  citation needed  It is unknown what film was run for audiences with this installation  Using Polaroid filters meant an entirely new form of projection  however  Two prints  each carrying either the right or left eye  had to be synced up in projection using an external selsyn motor  Furthermore  polarized light would not register on a matte white screen  and only a silver screen or screen made of other reflective material would correctly reflect the separate images  Later that year  the feature  Nozze Vagabonde appeared in Italy  followed in Germany by Zum Greifen Nah  You Can Nearly Touch It   and again in 1939 with Germany s Sechs M del Rollen Ins Wochenend  Six Girls Drive Into the Weekend   The Italian film was made with the Gualtierotti camera  the two German productions with the Zeiss camera and the Vierling shooting system  All of these films were the first exhibited using Polaroid filters  The Zeiss Company in Germany manufactured glasses on a commercial basis commencing in 1936  they were also independently made around the same time in Germany by E  K semann and by J  Mahler  33  In 1939  John Norling shot In Tune With Tomorrow  the first commercial 3 D film using Polaroid in the US citation needed   This short premiered at the 1939 New York World s Fair and was created specifically for the Chrysler Motor Pavilion  In it  a full 1939 Chrysler Plymouth is magically put together  set to music  Originally in black and white  the film was so popular that it was re shot in color for the following year at the fair  under the title New Dimensions citation needed   In 1953  it was reissued by RKO as Motor Rhythm  Another early short that utilized the Polaroid 3 D process was 1940 s Magic Movies  Thrills For You produced by the Pennsylvania Railroad Co  for the Golden Gate International Exposition citation needed   Produced by John Norling  it was actually shot for him by Jacob Leventhal using his own rig  It consisted of shots of various views that could be seen on Pennsylvania Railroad s trains  The 1940s was further hindered by World War II  and stereoscopic photography once again went on the back burner in most producers  minds   edit  The  golden era   1952 1955  What aficionados consider the  golden era  of 3 D began in 1952 with the release of the first color stereoscopic feature  Bwana Devil  produced  written and directed by Arch Oboler  The film was shot in Natural Vision  a process that was co created and controlled by M  L  Gunzberg  Gunzberg  who built the rig with his brother  Julian  and two other associates  shopped it without success to various studios before Oboler used it for this feature  which went into production with the title  The Lions of Gulu  34  The film starred Robert Stack  Barbara Britton and Nigel Bruce  As with practically all of the features made during this boom  Bwana Devil was projected dual strip  with Polaroid filters  During the 1950s  the familiar disposable anaglyph glasses made of cardboard were mainly used for comic books  two shorts by exploitation specialist Dan Sonney  and three shorts produced by Lippert Productions  However  even the Lippert shorts were available in the dual strip format alternatively  Because the features utilized two projectors  a capacity limit of film being loaded onto each projector  about 6 000 feet  1 800 m   or an hour s worth of film  meant that an intermission was necessary for every feature length film  Quite often  intermission points were written into the script at a major plot point  During Christmas of 1952  producer Sol Lesser quickly premiered the dual strip showcase called Stereo Techniques in Chicago  35  Lesser acquired the rights to five dual strip shorts  Two of them  Now is the Time  to Put On Your Glasses  and Around is Around  were directed by Norman McLaren in 1951 for the National Film Board of Canada  The other three films were produced in Britain for Festival of Britain in 1951 by Raymond Spottiswoode  These were A Solid Explanation  Royal River  and The Black Swan  James Mage was also an early pioneer in the 3 D craze  Using his 16 mm 3 D Bolex system  he premiered his Triorama program on February 10  1953 with his four shorts  Sunday In Stereo  Indian Summer  American Life  and This is Bolex Stereo  36  This show is considered lost  Another early 3 D film during the boom was the Lippert Productions short  A Day in the Country  narrated by Joe Besser and composed mostly of test footage  Unlike all of the other Lippert shorts  which were available in both dual strip and anaglyph  this production was released in anaglyph only  April 1953 saw two groundbreaking features in 3 D  Columbia s Man in the Dark and Warner Bros  House of Wax  the first 3 D feature with stereophonic sound  House of Wax  outside of Cinerama  was the first time many American audiences heard recorded stereophonic sound  It was also the film that typecast Vincent Price as a horror star as well as the  King of 3 D  after he became the actor to star in the most 3 D features  the others were The Mad Magician  Dangerous Mission  and Son of Sinbad   The success of these two films proved that major studios now had a method of getting moviegoers back into theaters and away from television sets  which were causing a steady decline in attendance  The Walt Disney Studios waded into 3 D with its May 28  1953 release of Melody  which accompanied the first 3 D western  Columbia s Fort Ti at its Los Angeles opening  It was later shown at Disneyland s Fantasyland Theater in 1957 as part of a program with Disney s other short Working for Peanuts  entitled  3 D Jamboree  The show was hosted by the Mousketeers and was in color  Universal International released their first 3 D feature on May 27  1953  It Came from Outer Space  with stereophonic sound  Following that was Paramount s first feature  Sangaree with Fernando Lamas and Arlene Dahl  Columbia released several 3 D westerns produced by Sam Katzman and directed by William Castle  Castle would later specialize in various technical in theater gimmicks for such Columbia and Allied Artists features as 13 Ghosts  House on Haunted Hill  and The Tingler  Columbia also produced the only slapstick comedies conceived for 3 D  The Three Stooges starred in Spooks and Pardon My Backfire  dialect comic Harry Mimmo starred in Down the Hatch  Producer Jules White was optimistic about the possibilities of 3 D as applied to slapstick  with pies and other projectiles aimed at the audience   but only two of his stereoscopic shorts were shown in 3 D  Down the Hatch was released as a conventional   flat  motion picture   Columbia has since printed Down the Hatch in 3 D for film festivals   John Ireland  Joanne Dru and Macdonald Carey starred in the Jack Broder color production Hannah Lee  which premiered June 19  1953  The film was directed by Ireland  who sued Broder for his salary  Broder counter sued  claiming that Ireland went over production costs with the film  citation needed  Another famous entry in the golden era of 3 D was the 3 Dimensional Pictures production of Robot Monster  The film was allegedly scribed in an hour by screenwriter Wyott Ordung and filmed in a period of two weeks on a shoestring budget  citation needed  Despite these shortcomings and the fact that the crew had no previous experience with the newly built camera rig  luck was on the cinematographer s side  as many find the 3 D photography in the film is well shot and aligned  Robot Monster also has a notable score by then up and coming composer Elmer Bernstein  The film was released June 24  1953 and went out with the short Stardust in Your Eyes  which starred nightclub comedian  Slick Slavin  citation needed  20th Century Fox produced their only 3 D feature  Inferno in 1953  starring Rhonda Fleming  Fleming  who also starred in Those Redheads From Seattle  and Jivaro  shares the spot for being the actress to appear in the most 3 D features with Patricia Medina  who starred in Sangaree  Phantom of the Rue Morgue and Drums of Tahiti  Darryl F  Zanuck expressed little interest in stereoscopic systems  and at that point was preparing to premiere the new widescreen film system  CinemaScope  The first decline in the theatrical 3 D craze started in August and September 1953  The factors causing this decline were  Two prints had to be projected simultaneously  The prints had to remain exactly alike after repair  or synchronization would be lost  It sometimes required two projectionists to keep sync working properly  When either prints or shutters became out of sync  the picture became virtually unwatchable and accounted for headaches and eyestrain  The necessary silver projection screen was very directional and caused sideline seating to be unusable with both 3 D and regular films  due to the angular darkening of these screens  Later films that opened in wider seated venues often premiered flat for that reason  such as Kiss Me Kate at the Radio City Music Hall   The few cartoons made in 3D had a  cardboard cutout  effect  where flat objects appeared on different planes  Because projection booth operators were at many times careless  even at preview screenings of 3 D films  trade and newspaper critics claimed that certain films were  hard on the eyes   citation needed  Sol Lesser attempted to follow up Stereo Techniques with a new showcase  this time five shorts that he himself produced  citation needed  The project was to be called The 3 D Follies and was to be distributed by RKO  citation needed  Unfortunately  because of financial difficulties and the growing disinterest in 3 D  Lesser canceled the project during the summer of 1953  making it the first 3 D film to be aborted in production  citation needed  Two of the three shorts were shot  Carmenesque  a burlesque number starring exotic dancer Lili St  Cyr  and Fun in the Sun  a sports short directed by famed set designer director William Cameron Menzies  who also directed the 3 D feature The Maze for Allied Artists  Although it was more expensive to install  the major competing realism process was anamorphic  first utilized by Fox with Cinemascope and its September premiere in The Robe  Anamorphic features needed only a single print  so synchronization was not an issue  Cinerama was also a competitor from the start and had better quality control than 3 D because it was owned by one company that focused on quality control  However  most of the 3 D features past the summer of 1953 were released in the flat widescreen formats ranging from 1 66 1 to 1 85 1  In early studio advertisements and articles about widescreen and 3 D formats  widescreen systems were referred to as  3 D   causing some confusion among scholars  There was no single instance of combining Cinemascope with 3 D until 1960  with a film called September Storm  and even then  that was a blow up from a non anamorphic negative  citation needed September Storm also went out with the last dual strip short  Space Attack  which was actually shot in 1954 under the title The Adventures of Sam Space  In December 1953  3 D made a comeback with the release of several important 3 D films  including MGM s musical Kiss Me  Kate  Kate was the hill over which 3 D had to pass to survive  MGM tested it in six theaters  three in 3 D and three flat  citation needed  According to trade ads of the time  the 3 D version was so well received that the film quickly went into a wide stereoscopic release  citation needed  However  most publications  including Kenneth Macgowan s classic film reference book Behind the Screen  state that the film did much better as a  regular  release  The film  adapted from the popular Cole Porter Broadway musical  starred the MGM songbird team of Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson as the leads  supported by Ann Miller  Keenan Wynn  Bobby Van  James Whitmore  Kurt Kasznar and Tommy Rall  The film also prominently promoted its use of stereophonic sound  Several other features that helped put 3 D back on the map that month were the John Wayne feature Hondo  distributed by Warner Bros    Columbia s Miss Sadie Thompson with Rita Hayworth  and Paramount s Money From Home with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis  Paramount also released the cartoon shorts Boo Moon with Casper  the Friendly Ghost and Popeye  Ace of Space with Popeye the Sailor  Paramount Pictures released a 3 D Korean War film Cease Fire filmed on actual Korean locations in 1953  Top Banana  based on the popular stage musical with Phil Silvers  was brought to the screen with the original cast  Although it was merely a filmed stage production  the idea was that every audience member would feel they would have the best seat in the house through color photography and 3 D  citation needed  Although the film was shot and edited in 3 D  United Artists  the distributor  felt the production was uneconomical in stereoscopic form and released the film flat on January 27  1954  citation needed  It remains one of two  Golden era  3  D features  along with another United Artists feature  Southwest Passage  with John Ireland and Joanne Dru   that are currently considered lost  although flat versions survive   A string of successful 3 D movies followed the second wave  Some highlights are  The French Line  starring Jane Russell and Gilbert Roland  a Howard Hughes RKO production  The film became notorious for being released without an MPAA seal of approval  after several suggestive lyrics were included  as well as one of Ms  Russell s particularly revealing costumes  citation needed  Playing up her sex appeal  one tagline for the film was   It ll knock both of your eyes out   The film was later cut and approved by the MPAA for a general flat release  despite having a wide and profitable 3 D release  citation needed  Taza  Son of Cochise  a sequel to 1950 s Broken Arrow  which starred Rock Hudson in the title role  Barbara Rush as the love interest  and Rex Reason  billed as Bart Roberts  as his renegade brother  released through Universal International  It was directed by the great stylist Douglas Sirk  and his striking visual sense made the film a huge success when it was  re premiered  in 2006 at the Second 3 D Expo in Hollywood  Two ape films  Phantom of the Rue Morgue  featuring Karl Malden and Patricia Medina  and produced by Warner Bros  and based on Edgar Allan Poe s  The Murders in the Rue Morgue   and Gorilla At Large  a Panoramic Production starring Cameron Mitchell  distributed through Fox  Creature from the Black Lagoon  starring Richard Carlson and Julie Adams  directed by Jack Arnold  Arguably the most famous 3 D movie  and the only 3 D feature that spawned a sequel  Revenge of the Creature in 3 D  followed by another sequel  The Creature Walks Among Us  shot flat   Cat Women of the Moon  an Astor Picture starring Victor Jory and Marie Windsor  Elmer Bernstein composed the score  Dial M for Murder  directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Ray Milland  Robert Cummings  and Grace Kelly  is considered by aficionados of 3 D to be one of the best examples of the process  Although available in 3 D in 1954  there are no known playdates in 3 D  since Warner Bros  had just instated a simultaneous 3 D 2 D release policy  The film s screening in 3 D in February 1980 at the York Theater in San Francisco did so well that Warner Bros  re released the film in 3 D in February 1982  Gog  an Ivan Tors production  dealing with realistic science fiction  The second film in Tors   Office of Scientific Investigation  trilogy of film  which included  The Magnetic Monster and Riders to the Stars  The Diamond Wizard  the only stereoscopic feature shot in Britain  released flat in both the UK and US  It starred and was directed by Dennis O Keefe  Irwin Allen s Dangerous Mission released by RKO in 1954 featuring Allen s trademarks of an all star cast facing a disaster  a forest fire   Son of Sinbad  another RKO Howard Hughes production  starring Dale Robertson  Lili St  Cyr  and Vincent Price  The film was shelved after Hughes ran into difficulty with The French Line  and wasn t released until 1955  at which time it went out flat  converted to the SuperScope process  3 D s final decline was in the late spring of 1954  for the same reasons as the previous lull  as well as the further success of widescreen formats with theater operators  Even though Polaroid had created a well designed  Tell Tale Filter Kit  for the purpose of recognizing and adjusting out of sync and phase 3 D  citation needed  exhibitors still felt uncomfortable with the system and turned their focus instead to processes such as CinemaScope  The last 3 D feature to be released in that format during the  Golden era  was Revenge of the Creature  on February 23  1955  Ironically  the film had a wide release in 3 D and was well received at the box office  37   edit  Revival  1960 1984  in single strip format Stereoscopic films largely remained dormant for the first part of the 1960s  with those that were released usually being anaglyph exploitation films  One film of notoriety was the Beaver Champion Warner Bros  production  The Mask  1961   The film was shot in 2 D  but to enhance the bizarre qualities of the dream world that is induced when the main character puts on a cursed tribal mask  these scenes went to anaglyph 3 D  These scenes were printed by Technicolor on their first run in red green anaglyph  Although 3 D films appeared sparsely during the early 1960s  the true second wave of 3 D cinema was set into motion by Arch Oboler  the same producer who started the craze of the 1950s  Using a new technology called Space Vision 3D  stereoscopic films were printed with two images  one above the other  in a single academy ratio frame  on a single strip  and needed only one projector fitted with a special lens  This so called  over and under  technique eliminated the need for dual projector set ups  and produced widescreen  but darker  less vivid  polarized 3 D images  Unlike earlier dual system  it could stay in perfect synchronization  unless improperly spliced in repair  Arch Oboler once again had the vision for the system that no one else would touch  and put it to use on his film entitled The Bubble  which starred Michael Cole  Deborah Walley  and Johnny Desmond  As with Bwana Devil  the critics panned The Bubble  but audiences flocked to see it  and it became financially sound enough to promote the use of the system to other studios  particularly independents  who did not have the money for expensive dual strip prints of their productions  In 1970  Stereovision  a new entity founded by director inventor Allan Silliphant and optical designer Chris Condon  developed a different 35 mm single strip format  which printed two images squeezed side by side and used an anamorphic lens to widen the pictures through polaroid filters  Louis K  Sher  Sherpix  and Stereovision released the softcore sex comedy The Stewardesses  self rated X  but later re rated R by the MPAA   The film cost  100 000 USD to produce  and ran for months in several markets  citation needed  eventually earning  27 million in North America  alone   140 million in constant 2010 dollars  in fewer than 800 theaters  becoming the most profitable 3 Dimensional film to date  and in purely relative terms  one of the most profitable films ever  It was later released in 70 mm 3 D  Some 36 films worldwide were made with Stereovision over 25 years  using either a widescreen  above below   anamorphic  side by side  or 70 mm 3 D formats  citation needed  In 2009 The Stewardesses was remastered by Chris Condon and director Ed Meyer  releasing it in XpanD 3D  RealD Cinema and Dolby 3D  The quality of the 1970s 3 D films was not much more inventive  as many were either softcore and even hardcore adult films  horror films  or a combination of both  Paul Morrisey s Flesh For Frankenstein  aka Andy Warhol s Frankenstein  was a superlative example of such a combination  Between 1981 and 1983 there was a new Hollywood 3D craze started by the spaghetti western Comin  at Ya   When Parasite was released it was billed as the first horror film to come out in 3D in over 20 years  Horror movies and reissues of 1950s 3D classics  such as Hitchcock s Dial  M  for Murder  dominated the 3D releases that followed  The second sequel in the Friday the 13th series  Friday the 13th Part III  was released very successfully  Apparently saying  part 3 in 3D  was considered too cumbersome so it was shortened in the titles of Jaws 3 D and Amityville 3 D  which emphasized off the screen effects to the point of being annoying at times  especially when flashlights were shone into the eyes of the audience  The science fiction film Spacehunter  Adventures in the Forbidden Zone was the most expensive 3D movie made up to that point with production costs about the same as Star Wars but not nearly the same box office success  causing the craze to fade quickly through spring 1983  Other sci fi fantasy films were released as well including Metalstorm  The Destruction of Jared Syn and Treasure of the Four Crowns  which was widely criticized for poor editing and plot holes  but did feature some truly spectacular closeups  3D releases after the second craze included The Man Who Wasn t There  1983   Silent Madness and the 1985 animated film Starchaser  The Legend of Orin  whose plot seemed to borrow heavily from Star Wars   Only Comin  At Ya   Parasite  and Friday the 13th Part III have been officially released on VHS and or DVD in 3 D in the United States  although Amityville 3 D has seen a 3 D DVD release in the United Kingdom   Most of the 1980s 3D movies and some of the classic 1950s movies such as House of Wax were released on the now defunct Video Disc  VHD  format in Japan as part of a system that used shutter glasses  Most of these have been unofficially transferred to DVD and are available on the grey market through sites such as eBay   edit  Rebirth of 3 D  1985 2003  In the mid 1980s  IMAX began producing non fiction films for its nascent 3 D business  starting with  We Are Born of Stars   Roman Kroitor  1985   A key point was that this production  as with all subsequent IMAX productions  emphasized mathematical correctness of the 3D rendition and thus largely eliminated the eye fatigue and pain that resulted from the approximate geometries of previous 3D incarnations  In addition  and in contrast to previous 35mm based 3D presentations  the very large field of view provided by IMAX allowed a much broader 3D  stage   arguably as important in 3D film as it is theatre  In 1986  Disney Theme Parks and Universal Studios began to use 3D films to impress audiences in special venues  Captain Eo  Francis Ford Coppola  1986  starring Michael Jackson  being a very notable example  In the same year  the National Film Board of Canada production Transitions  Colin Low   created for Expo 86 in Vancouver  was the first IMAX presentation using polarized glasses   Echos of the Sun   Roman Kroitor  1990  was the first IMAX film to be presented using alternate eye shutterglass technology  a development required because the dome screen precluded the use of polarized technology  From 1990 onward  numerous films were produced by all three parties to satisfy the demands of their various high profile special attractions and IMAX s expanding 3D network  Films of special note during this period include the extremely successful  Into The Deep   Graeme Ferguson  1995  and the first IMAX 3 D fiction film Wings of Courage  1996   by director Jean Jacques Annaud  about the pilot Henri Guillaumet  Other stereoscopic films produced in this period include  The Last Buffalo  Stephen Low  1990  Jim Henson s Muppet Vision 3D  Jim Henson  1991  Imagine  John Weiley  1993  Honey  I Shrunk the Audience  Daniel Rustuccio  1994  Into the Deep  Graeme Ferguson  1995  Across the Sea of Time  Stephen Low  1995  Wings of Courage  Jean Jacques Annaud  1996  L5  First City in Space  Graeme Ferguson  1996  T2 3 D  Battle Across Time  James Cameron  1996  Paint Misbehavin  Roman Kroitor and Peter Stephenson  1997  IMAX Nutcracker  1997  The Hidden Dimension

Stassen  2003  By 2004  54   133 theaters of 248  of the IMAX community was 3D capable  38  Shortly thereafter  higher quality computer animation  competition from DVDs and other media  digital projection  digital video capture  and the use of sophisticated IMAX 70mm film projectors  created an opportunity for another wave of 3D films  8  9   edit  Mainstream resurgence  2003 present  In 2003  Ghosts of the Abyss by James Cameron was released as the first full length 3 D IMAX feature filmed with the Reality Camera System  This camera system used the latest HD video cameras  not film  and was built for Cameron by Vince Pace  to his specifications  The same camera system was used to film Spy Kids 3 D  Game Over  2003   Aliens of the Deep IMAX  2005   and The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3 D  2005   In 2004  Las Vegas Hilton released Star Trek  The Experience which included two films  One of the films  Borg Invasion 4 D  Ty Granoroli   was in 3D  In August of the same year  rap group Insane Clown Posse released their ninth studio album Hell s Pit  One of two versions of the album contained a DVD featuring a 3 D short film for the track  Bowling Balls   shot in high definition video  39  In November 2004  The Polar Express was released as IMAX s first full length  animated 3 D feature  It was released in 3 584 theaters in 2D  and only 66 IMAX locations  The return from those few 3 D theaters was about 25  of the total  The 3 D version earned about 14 times as much per screen as the 2D version  This pattern continued and prompted a greatly intensified interest in 3 D and 3 D presentation of animated films  In June 2005  the Mann s Chinese 6 theatre in Hollywood became the first commercial movie theatre to be equipped with the Digital 3D format  Both Singin  in the Rain and The Polar Express were tested in the Digital 3D format over the course of several months  In November 2005  Walt Disney Studio Entertainment released Chicken Little in digital 3 D format  The Butler s in Love  a short film directed by Anders Laursen and starring Elizabeth Berkley and Thomas Jane 40  was released on June 23  2008  The film was shot at the former Industrial Light  amp  Magic studios using KernerFX s prototype Kernercam stereoscopic camera rig  Ben Walters suggests that both filmmakers and film exhibitors regain interest in 3 D film  There are now more 3 D exhibition equipments  and more dramatic films being shot in 3 D format  One incentive is that the technology is more mature  Shooting in 3 D format is less limited  and the result is more stable  Another incentive is the fact that while 2 D ticket sales are in an overall state of decline  revenues from 3 D tickets continue to grow  41  Through the entire history of 3D presentations  techniques to convert existing 2D images for 3D presentation have existed  Few have been effective or survived  The combination of digital and digitized source material with relatively cost effective digital post processing has spawned a new wave of conversion products  In June 2006  IMAX and Warner Bros  released Superman Returns including 20 minutes of 3 D images converted from the 2 D original digital footage  George Lucas has announced that he will re release his Star Wars films in 3 D based on a conversion process from the company In Three  Later on in 2011  it was announced that Lucas works with the company Prime Focus on this conversion  42  In late 2005  Steven Spielberg told the press he was involved in patenting a 3 D cinema system that does not need glasses  and which is based on plasma screens  A computer splits each film frame  and then projects the two split images onto the screen at differing angles  to be picked up by tiny angled ridges on the screen  citation needed  Animated films Open Season  and The Ant Bully  were released in Analog 3D in 2006  Monster House and The Nightmare Before Christmas were released on XpanD 3D  RealD and Dolby 3D systems in 2006  On May 19  2007 Scar3D opened at the Cannes Film Market  It was the first US produced 3D full length feature film to be completed in Real D 3D  It has been the  1 film at the box office in several countries around the world  including Russia where it opened in 3D on 295 screens  2008 3 D films included Hannah Montana  amp  Miley Cyrus  Best of Both Worlds Concert  Journey to the Center of the Earth  and Bolt  On January 16  2009  Lionsgate released My Bloody Valentine 3D  the first horror film and first R rated film to be projected in Real D 3D  43  It was released to 1 033 3D screens  the most ever for this format  and 1 501 regular screens  Another R Rated film  The Final Destination  was released later that year  August 28  to even more screens  It was the first of its series to be released in HD 3 D  On May 7  2009 the British Film Institute commissioned a 3D film installation  The film Radio Mania  An Abandoned Work consists of two screens of stereoscopic 3D film with 3D Ambisonic sound  It stars Kevin Eldon and is by British artists Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard  The first 3 D Webisode series was Horrorween starting September 1  2009    I think it s a misnomer to call it 3 D versus 2 D  The whole point of cinematic imagery is it s three dimensional    95  of our depth cues come from occlusion  resolution  color and so forth  so the idea of calling a 2 D movie a  2 D movie  is a little misleading    When you watch through any of the conventional 3 D processes you re giving up three foot lamberts  A massive difference     though  your eye compensates      Director Christopher Nolan 44  Major 3 D films in 2009 included Coraline  Monsters vs  Aliens  Up  X Games 3D  The Movie  The Final Destination  and Avatar  45 Avatar has gone on to be one of the most expensive films of all time  with a budget at 237M  it is also the highest grossing film of all time  The main technologies used to exhibit these films  and many others released around the time and up to the present  are Real D 3D  Dolby 3D  XpanD 3D  MasterImage 3D  and IMAX 3D  March and April 2010 saw three major 3 D releases clustered together  with Alice in Wonderland hitting US theaters on March 5  2010  How to Train Your Dragon on March 26  2010 and Clash of the Titans on April 2  2010  On May 13  2010  China s first IMAX 3D film started shooting  46  The pre production of the first 3 D film shot in France  Derri re les murs  began in May 2010  and it will be released in mid 2011  On October 1  2010 Scar3D was the first ever stereoscopic 3D Video on demand film released through major cable broadcasters for 3D televisions in the United States  Released in the United States on May 21  2010  Shrek Forever After by DreamWorks Animation  Paramount Pictures  used the Real D 3D system  also released in IMAX 3D  Due to growing popularity of 3 D and an increase in 3 D screens  an increasing amount of newly released films have been screened in 3 D  However  film industry observers have noted that 2011 has shown a considerable decline in audience interest in 3 D presentation  For instance  only 45  of the premiere weekend box office earnings of Kung Fu Panda 2 came from screenings in the 3D presentation format as opposed to 60  for Shrek Forever After in 2010  47  In addition  the premiere of Cars 2 opening weekend gross consisted of only 37  from 3 D theatres  48  In view of this trend  there has been box office analysis concluding the implementation of 3 D presentation is apparently backfiring by discouraging people from going to movie theatres at all  As Brandon Gray of Box Office Mojo notes   In each case  3D s more money from fewer people approach has simply led to less money from even fewer people   49  One of the leading proponents of 3 D film and the producer of some of the most critically acclaimed films in this format such as How To Train Your Dragon  Rotten Tomatoes score of 98  50   and Kung Fu Panda 2  RT 82  51    Jeffrey Katzenberg  blames oversaturation of the market with inferior films  especially ones photographed conventionally and then digitally processed in post production for the 3 D format  such asThe Last Airbender  RT 6  52   and Cats  amp  Dogs  The Revenge of Kitty Galore  RT 13  53   that have led to audiences concluding the format is not worth the additional expense to see  54  However at the global box office 6 3D films have grossed over  1 billion each  3 from 2011  2 from 2010 and 1 from 2009   edit  World 3 D Expositions In September 2003  Sabucat Productions organized the first World 3 D Exposition  celebrating the 50th anniversary of the original craze  The Expo was held at Grauman s Egyptian Theatre  During the two week festival  over 30 of the 50  golden era  stereoscopic features  as well as shorts  were screened  many coming from the collection of film historian and archivist Robert Furmanek  who had spent the previous 15 years painstakingly tracking down and preserving each film to its original glory  In attendance were many stars from each film  respectively  and some were moved to tears by the sold out seating with audiences of film buffs from all over the world who came to remember their previous glories  In May 2006  the second World 3 D Exposition was announced for September of that year  presented by the 3 D Film Preservation Fund  Along with the favorites of the previous exposition were newly discovered features and shorts  and like the previous Expo  guests from each film  Expo II was announced as being the locale for the world premiere of several films never before seen in 3 D  including The Diamond Wizard and the Universal short  Hawaiian Nights with Mamie Van Doren and Pinky Lee  Other  re premieres  of films not seen since their original release in stereoscopic form included Cease Fire   Taza  Son of Cochise  Wings of the Hawk  and Those Redheads From Seattle  Also shown were the long lost shorts Carmenesque and A Day in the Country  both 1953  and William Van Doren Kelley s two Plasticon shorts  1922 and 1923    edit  Criticism   After Toy Story  there were 10 really bad CG movies because everybody thought the success of that film was CG and not great characters that were beautifully designed and heartwarming  Now  you ve got people quickly converting movies from 2D to 3D  which is not what we did  They re expecting the same result  when in fact they will probably work against the adoption of 3D because they ll be putting out an inferior product      Avatar director James Cameron 55  Most of the cues required to provide humans with relative depth information are already present in traditional 2D films  For example  closer objects occlude further ones  distant objects are desaturated and hazy relative to near ones  and the brain subconsciously  knows  the distance of many objects when the height is known  e g  a human figure subtending only a small amount of the screen is more likely to be 2 m tall and far away than 10 cm tall and close   In fact  only two of these depth cues are not already present in 2D films  stereopsis  or parallax  and the focus of the eyeball  accommodation   3D film making addresses accurate presentation of stereopsis but not of accommodation  and therefore is insufficient in providing a complete 3D illusion  However  promising results from research aimed at overcoming this shortcoming were presented at the 2010 Stereoscopic Displays and Applications conference in San Jose  U S  56  Motion sickness  in addition to other health concerns  57  are more easily induced by 3 D presentations  Film critic Mark Kermode 58  argued that 3 D adds  not that much  of value to a film  and said that  while he liked Avatar  the many impressive things he saw in the movie had nothing to do with 3 D  Kermode has been an outspoken critic of 3 D film describing the effect as a  nonsense  and recommends using two right or left lenses from the 3 D glasses to cut out the  pointy  pointy 3 D stereoscopic vision   although this technique still does not improve the 30  colour loss from a 3 D film  59  Versions of these  2 D glasses  are being marketed  60  Film critic Roger Ebert has repeatedly criticized 3 D film as being  too dim   due to the polarized light technology using only half the light for each eye   sometimes distracting or even nausea inducing  and argues that it is an expensive technology that adds nothing of value to the movie going experience  since 2 D movies already provide a sufficient illusion of 3 D   61  While Ebert is  not opposed to 3 D as an option   he opposes it as a replacement for traditional film  and prefers 2 D techologies such as MaxiVision48 that improve image area resolution and frames per second  61  Director Christopher Nolan has stated that while two dimensional film displays at 16 foot lamberts of luminance  the addition of 3 D sacrifices up to three foot lamberts  which he criticises as   A massive difference  You re not that aware of it because once you re  in that world   your eye compensates  but having struggled for years to get theaters up to the proper brightness  we re not sticking polarized filters in everything   62  Another major criticism is that many of the movies in the 21st century to date were not filmed in 3D  but converted after filming  Filmmakers who have criticized this process include James Cameron  whose film Avatar was created in 3D from the ground up and is largely credited with the revival of 3 D  and Michael Bay  whose film Transformers  Dark of the Moon was also created in 3D from the ground up and has been considered the best use of 3D since Avatar  55  Director Christopher Nolan has criticised the notion that traditional film does not allow depth perception  saying  I think it s a misnomer to call it 3D versus 2D  The whole point of cinematic imagery is it s three dimensional    You know 95  of our depth cues come from occlusion  resolution  color and so forth  so the idea of calling a 2D movie a  2D movie  is a little misleading   63  Nolan also criticised that shooting on the required digital video does not offer a high enough quality image 64  and that 3D cameras cannot be equipped with prime lenses  63   edit  See also List of 3 D films 2D to 3D Conversion 3 D Film Preservation Fund 3D television 3D display Autostereoscopy Stereoscopy Volumetric
