a   12  13  a kingdom  later  region  named after the ancient Macedonians  Their name             Maked nes   derives ultimately from the ancient Greek adjective           makedn s   meaning  tall  taper   14  which shares the same root as the noun         m kros   meaning  length  in both ancient and modern Greek  15  The name is originally believed to have meant either  highlanders  or  the tall ones   13  16  17  possibly referring to the physical character of the ancient Macedonians and their mountainous land  History Main article  History of the Republic of Macedonia Ancient history of the territory Main articles  Macedonia  region  and Paeonia  kingdom  The ruins of Heraclea Lyncestis  a city founded by Philip II of Macedon in the 4th century BC In antiquity  most of what is now the Republic of Macedonia was inhabited by Paeonians  a Thracian people  18  whilst the northwest was inhabited by the Dardani and the southwest by tribes known historically as the Enchelae  Pelagones and Lyncestae  the latter two are generally regarded as Molossian or Upper Macedonian tribes  whilst the former two are considered Illyrian  19  20  21  22  23  24  After the early victories of Philip II of Macedon in 356 BC  he absorbed 25  the regions of Upper Macedonia into the Kingdom of Macedon  including Lynkestis  Pelagonia  and the southern part of Paeonia  Deuriopus   which now lie within the Republic of Macedonia  26  Philip did not make the people of Upper Macedonia subject but instead made them equal to the Macedonians of Lower Macedonia  25  Philip s son Alexander the Great conquered the remainder of the region  reaching as far north as the Danube  and incorporated it in his empire  The Romans established the Province of Macedonia in 146 BC  By the time of Diocletian  the province had been subdivided between Macedonia Prima and Macedonia Salutaris  most of country s modern boundaries fell within the latter  with the city of Stobi as the capital of Macedonia Salutaris  27  Cities to the extreme north such as Scupi fell within the Province of Moesia  28  Whilst Greek remained the dominant language in the south  Latin made significant inroads in Macedonia  29  Medieval period Main article  South Slavs Further information  Ottoman Vardar Macedonia Sklaviniae in Medieval Macedonia c  700 AD During the 580s  Byzantine literature attests to the Slavs raiding Byzantine territories in the region of Macedonia  aided by Avars or Bulgars  Historical records document that in c 680 a group of Bulgars  Slavs and Byzantines led by a Bulgar called Kuber settled in the region of Keramisian plain  centred on the city of Bitola  30 Presian s reign apparently coincides with the extension of Bulgarian control over the Slavic tribes in and around Macedonia  The Slavic peoples that settled in the region of Macedonia accepted Christianity as their own religion around the 9th century  during the reign of Tsar Boris I of Bulgaria  In 1014  Emperor Basil II finally defeated the armies of Tsar Samuil of Bulgaria and by 1018 the Byzantines restored control over Macedonia  and all of the Balkans  for the first time since the 7th century  However  by the late 12th century  Byzantine decline saw the region contested by various political entities  including a brief Norman occupation in the 1080s  In the early 13th century  a revived Bulgarian Empire gained control of the region  Plagued by political difficulties the empire did not last and the region came once again under Byzantine control in early 14th century  In the 14th century  it became part of the Serbian Empire  who saw themselves as liberators of their Slavic kin from Byzantine despotism  Skopje became the capital of Tsar Stefan Dusan s empire  With Dusan s death  a weak successor appeared and power struggles between nobles divided the Balkans once again  This coincided with the entry of the Ottoman Turks into Europe  The Kingdom of Prilep was one of the short lived states that emerged from the collapse of the Serbian Empire in the 14th century  31  With no major Balkan power left to defend Christianity  the central Balkans fell to Turkish rule   and remained under it for five centuries  National awakening Main article  Macedonian nationalism Nikola Karev  president of the short lived Krushevo Republic during the Ilinden Uprising Ottoman rule over the region was considered harsh  With the beginning of the Bulgarian National Revival in 18 c  many of the reformers were from this region  including Miladinov Brothers  32 Rajko  inzifov  Joakim Kr ovski  33 Kiril Pej inovi  34  and others  The bishoprics of Skopje  Debar  Bitola  Ohrid  Veles and Strumica voted to join the Bulgarian Exarchate after it was established in 1870  35  Several movements whose goals were the establishment of autonomous Macedonia  encompassing the entire region of Macedonia  began to arise in the late 19th century  the earliest of these was the Bulgarian Macedonian Adrianople Revolutionary Committees  later transformed to SMORO  In 1905 it was renamed as Internal Macedonian Adrianople Revolutionary Organization  IMARO  and after World War I the organization separated into the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization  IMRO  and the Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation  ITRO   The early organization did not proclaim any ethnic identities  it was officially open to     uniting all the disgruntled elements in Macedonia and the Adrianople region  regardless of their nationality     36  The majority of its members however were Macedonian Bulgarians 37  In 1903  IMRO organised the Ilinden Preobrazhenie Uprising against the Ottomans  which after some initial successes  including the forming of the  Krushevo Republic   was crushed with much loss of life  The uprising and the forming of the Krushevo Republic are considered the cornerstone and precursors to the eventual establishment of the Macedonian state  Kingdoms of Serbia and Yugoslavia The division of the region of Macedonia after the Balkan Wars according to the Treaty of Bucharest Following the two Balkan wars of 1912 and 1913 and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire  most of its European held territories were divided between Greece  Bulgaria and Serbia  The territory of the modern Macedonian state was then named Ju na Srbija   Southern Serbia   After the First World War  Kingdom of Serbia became part of the Kingdom of Serbs  Croats and Slovenes  In 1929  the Kingdom was officially renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and divided into provinces called banovinas  Southern Serbia  including all of what is now the Republic of Macedonia  became known as the Vardar Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia  The concept of a United Macedonia was used by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization  IMRO  in the interbellum  Its leaders   like Todor Alexandrov  Aleksandar Protogerov  Ivan Mihailov  promoted the idea with the aim to liberate the territories occupied by Serbia and Greece and to create an independent and united Macedonia for all Macedonians  regardless of religion and ethnicity citation needed   The Bulgarian government of Alexander Malinov in 1918 offered to give Pirin Macedonia for that purpose after World War I  38  but the Great Powers did not adopt this idea  because Serbia and Greece opposed citation needed   IMRO followed by starting an insurgent war in Vardar Banovina  together with Macedonian Youth Secret Revolutionary Organization  which also conducted guerilla attacks against the Serbian administrative and army officials there  In 1923 in Stip a paramilitary organisation called Union against the Bulgarian bandits was formed by Serbian chetniks  IMRO renegades and Macedonian Federative Organization  MFO  members to oppose

During World War II  Yugoslavia was occupied by the Axis Powers from 1941 to 1945  The Vardar Banovina was divided between Bulgaria and Italian occupied Albania  Bulgarian Action Committees were established and prepared the region for the new Bulgarian administration and army  40  The Committees were mosltly formed by former members of IMRO  but some communists like Panko Brashnarov  Strahil Gigov and Metodi Shatorov also participated  Shatorov as leader of Vardar Macedonia communists switched from Yugoslav Communist Party to Bulgarian Communist Party 41  42  and refused to start military action against the Bulgarian army  43  Bulgarian authorities  under German pressure  44  were responsible for the round up and deportation of over 7 000 Jews in Skopje and Bitola  45  Harsh rule by the occupying forces encouraged many Macedonians to support the Communist Partisan resistance movement of Josip Broz Tito after 1943  46  and the National Liberation War ensued  with German forces being driven out of Macedonia by the end of 1944  In Vardar Macedonia  after Bulgarian coup d  tat of 1944 the Bulgarian troops  surrounded by German forces  fought their way back to the old borders of Bulgaria  Under the leadership of the new Bulgarian pro Soviet government  four armies  455 000 strong in total  were mobilized and reorganized  Most of them reentered occupied Yugoslavia in the early October 1944 and moved from Sofia to Ni   Skopje and Pristina with the strategic task of blocking the German forces withdrawing from Greece  47  Compelled by the Soviet Union with a view towards the creation of a large South Slav Federation  Bulgarian government once again offered to give Pirin Macedonia to such a United Macedonia in 1945  Socialist Yugoslavia Main article  Socialist Republic of Macedonia Macedonia  dark red  was one of the republics within the Socialist Yugoslavia  In 1944 the Anti Fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia  ASNOM  proclaimed the People s Republic of Macedonia as part of the People s Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  ASNOM remained an acting government until the end of the war  The Macedonian alphabet was codified by linguists of ASNOM  who based their alphabet on the phonetic alphabet of Vuk Stefanovi  Karad i  and the principles of Krste Petkov   Misirkov  The new republic became one of the six republics of the Yugoslav federation  Following the federation s renaming as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1963  the People s Republic of Macedonia was likewise renamed  becoming the Socialist Republic of Macedonia  During the civil war in Greece  1946 1949  Macedonian communist insurgents supported the Greek communists  Many refugees fled to the Socialist Republic of Macedonia from there  The state dropped the  Socialist  from its name in 1991 when it peacefully seceded from Yugoslavia  Declaration of independence The country officially celebrates 8 September 1991 as Independence day  Macedonian                       Den na nezavisnosta   with regard to the referendum endorsing independence from Yugoslavia  albeit legalising participation in future union of the former states of Yugoslavia  The anniversary of the start of the Ilinden Uprising  St  Elijah s Day  on 2 August is also widely celebrated on an official level as the Day of the Republic  Robert Badinter as a head of Arbitration Commission of the Peace Conference on the former Yugoslavia recommended EC recognition in January 1992  48  Macedonia remained at peace through the Yugoslav wars of the early 1990s  A few very minor changes to its border with Yugoslavia were agreed upon to resolve problems with the demarcation line between the two countries  However  it was seriously destabilised by the Kosovo War in 1999  when an estimated 360 000 ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo took refuge in the country  Although they departed shortly after the war  soon after  Albanian nationalists on both sides of the border took up arms in pursuit of autonomy or independence for the Albanian populated areas of Macedonia  Albanian insurgency Main article  Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia A civil war was fought between government and ethnic Albanian insurgents  mostly in the north and west of the country  between March and June 2001  The war ended with the intervention of a NATO ceasefire monitoring force  Under the terms of the Ohrid Agreement  the government agreed to devolve greater political power and cultural recognition to the Albanian minority  The Albanian side agreed to abandon separatist demands and to fully recognise all Macedonian institutions  In addition  according to this accord  the NLA were to disarm and hand over their weapons to a NATO force  However  in March 2012  new ethnic incidents occured througout whole country  which included capitol city Skopje  49  Geography Main article  Geography of the Republic of Macedonia Korab  the tallest mountain in Macedonia Macedonia has a total area of

Macedonia Macedonia is a landlocked country that is geographically clearly defined by a central valley formed by the Vardar river and framed along its borders by mountain ranges  The terrain is mostly rugged  located between the  ar Mountains and Osogovo  which frame the valley of the Vardar river  Three large lakes   Lake Ohrid  Lake Prespa and Dojran Lake   lie on the southern borders  bisected by the frontiers with Albania and Greece  Ohrid is considered to be one of the oldest lakes and biotopes in the world  50  The region is seismically active and has been the site of destructive earthquakes in the past  most recently in 1963 when Skopje was heavily damaged by a major earthquake  killing over 1 000  Macedonia also has scenic mountains  They belong to two different mountain ranges  the first is the  ar Mountains 51  52  that continues to the West Vardar Pelagonia group of mountains  Baba Mountain  Nid e  Kozuf and Jakupica   also known as the Dinaric range  The second range is the Osogovo Belasica mountain chain  also known as the Rhodope range  The mountains belonging to the  ar Mountains and the West Vardar Pelagonia range are younger and higher than the older mountains that are part of the Osogovo Belasica mountain group  Hydrography Smolare Waterfall In the Republic of Macedonia there are 1 100 larger sources of water  The rivers flow into three different basins  the Aegean  the Adriatic and the Black Sea basin  53  The Aegean basin is the largest  It covers 87  of the territory of the Republic  which is 22 075 km  sq  Vardar  the largest river in this basin  drains 80  of the territory or 20 459 km  sq  Its valley plays an important part in the economy and the communication system of the country  The project named  The Vardar Valley  is considered to be crucial for the strategic development of the country  The river Black Drin forms the Adriatic basin  which covers an area of about 3 320 km  sq   i  e  13  of the territory  It receives water from Lakes Prespa and Ohrid  The Black Sea basin is the smallest with only 37 km  sq  It covers the northern side of Mount Skopska Crna Gora  This is the source of the river Binachka Morava  which

the Macedonian Pine or Molika  one of Macedonia s most recognizable trees The flora of Republic of Macedonia is represented with around 210 families  920 genera  and around 3 700 plant species  The most abundant group are the flowering plants with around 3 200 species  which is followed by mosses  350 species  and ferns  42   Phytogeographically  Macedonia belongs to the Illyrian province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom  According to the World Wide Fund for Nature  WWF  and Digital Map of European Ecological Regions by the European Environment Agency  the territory of the Republic can be subdivided into four ecoregions  the Pindus Mountains mixed forests  Balkan mixed forests  Rhodopes mixed forests and Aegean sclerophyllous and mixed forests  National Park of Pelister in Bitola is known for the presence of the endemic Macedonian Pine  as well as some 88 species of plants representing almost 30 percent of Macedonian dendroflora  The Macedonian Pine forests on Pelister are divided into two communities  pine forests with ferns and pine forests with junipers  The Macedonian Pine  as a specific conifer species  is a relict of tertiary flora and the five needle pine Molika  was first noted on Pelister in 1893  Macedonia s limited forest growth also includes Macedonian Oaks  the sycamore  weeping willows  white willows  alders  poplars  elms  and the common ash  Near the rich pastures on  ar Mountain and Bistra  Mavrovo  is another plant species characteristic of plant life in Macedonia the poppy  The quality of thick poppy juice is measured worldwide by morphine units  while Chinese opium contains eight such units and is considered to be of high quality  Indian opium contains seven units  and Turkish opium only six  Macedonian opium contains a full 14 morphine units and is one of the best quality opium in the world  54  Fauna The Eurasian lynx and the  arplaninec  Main article  Fauna of Macedonia The fauna of Macedonian forests is abundant and includes bears  wild boars  wolves  foxes  squirrels  chamois and deer  The lynx is found  although very rarely  in the mountains of western Macedonia  while deer can be found in the region of Demir Kapija  Forest birds include the blackcap  the grouse  the black grouse  the imperial eagle and the forest owl  The three artificial lakes of the country represent a separate fauna zone  an indication of long lasting territorial and temporal isolation  The fauna of Lake Ohrid is a relict of an earlier era and the lake is widely known for its letnica trout  lake whitefish  gudgeon  roach  podust  and pior  as well as for certain species of snails of a genus older than 30 million years  similar species can only be found in Lake Baikal  Lake Ohrid is also noted in zoology texts for the European eel and its baffling reproductive cycle  it comes to Lake Ohrid from the distant Sargasso Sea  thousands of kilometres away  and lurks in the depths of the lake for 10 years  When sexually mature  the eel is driven by unexplained instincts in the autumn to set off back to its point of birth  There it spawns and dies  leaving its offspring to seek out Lake Ohrid to begin the cycle anew  Domestic animals The shepherd dog of  ar Mountain is known worldwide as  arplaninec  Yugoslav shepherd   It stands some 60 centimeters tall and is a brave and fierce fighter that may be called upon to fight bears or wolf packs in guarding and defending flocks  The  arplaninec originates from the shepherd s dog of the ancient Epirotes  the molossus  but the  arplaninec was recognized as its own species in 1939 under the name of  Illyrian shepherd  and since 1956 has been known as  arplaninec  Politics Main article  Politics of the Republic of Macedonia Macedonia is a parliamentary democracy with an executive government composed of a coalition of parties from the unicameral legislature            Sobranie  and an independent judicial branch with a constitutional court  The Assembly is made up of 120 seats and the members are elected every four years  The role of the President of the Republic is mostly ceremonial  with the real power resting in the hands of the President of the Government  The President is the commander in chief of the state armed forces and a president of the state Security Council  The President is elected every five years and he or she can be elected twice at most  On the second run of the presidential elections held on 5 April 2009  Gjorge Ivanov was elected as new Macedonian president  55  With the passage of a new law and elections held in 2005  local government functions are divided between 78 municipalities           op tini  singular           op tina   The capital  Skopje  is governed as a group of ten municipalities collectively referred to as the  City of Skopje   Municipalities in Macedonia are units of local self government  Neighbouring municipalities may establish co operative arrangements  The country s main political divergence is between the largely ethnically based political parties representing the country s ethnic Macedonian majority and Albanian minority  The issue of the power balance between the two communities led to a brief war in 2001  following which a power sharing agreement was reached  In August 2004  Macedonia s parliament passed legislation redrawing local boundaries and giving greater local autonomy to ethnic Albanians in areas where they predominate  After a troublesome pre election campaign  Macedonia saw a relatively calm and democratic change of government in the elections held on 5 July 2006  The elections were marked by a decisive victory of the centre right party VMRO DPMNE led by Nikola Gruevski  Gruevski s decision to include the Democratic Party of Albanians in the new government  instead of the Democratic Union for Integration   Party for Democratic Prosperity coalition which won the majority of the Albanian votes  triggered protests throughout the parts of the country with a respective number of Albanian population  However  recently a dialogue was established between the Democratic Union for Integration and the ruling VMRO DMPNE party as an effort to talk about the disputes between the two parties and to support European and NATO aspirations of the country  56  After the early parliamentary elections held in 2008  VMRO DPMNE and Democratic Union for Integration formed a ruling coalition in Macedonia  57  In April 2009  presidential and local elections in the country were carried out peacefully  which was crucial for Macedonian aspirations to join the EU 58  The ruling conservative VMRO DPMNE party won a victory in the local elections and the candidate supported by the party  Gjorgi Ivanov  was elected as the new Macedonian president  Parliament Main article

since 1996   WTO  since 2003   CEFTA  since 2006   La Francophonie  since 2001   In 2005  the country was officially recognized as a European Union candidate state  On the NATO summit held in Bucharest in April 2008  Macedonia failed to gain an invitation to join the organisation because Greece vetoed the move after the dispute over the name issue  61  The USA had previously expressed support for an invitation  62  but the summit then decided to extend an invitation only on condition of a resolution of the naming conflict with Greece  In March 2009 the European Parliament expressed support for Macedonia s EU candidacy and asked the EU Commission to grant the country a date for the start of accession talks by the end of 2009  The parliament also recommended a speedy lifting of the visa regime for Macedonian citizens  63  However  Macedonia has so far failed to receive a start date for accession talks as a result of the naming dispute  The EU s stance is similar to NATO s in that resolution of the naming dispute is a precondition for the start of accession talks  Naming dispute Main article  Macedonia naming dispute After the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991  the name of Macedonia became the object of a dispute between Greece and the newly independent Republic of Macedonia  64  In the south  the Republic of Macedonia borders the region of Greek Macedonia  which administratively is split into three peripheries  one of them comprising both Western Thrace and a part of Greek Macedonia   Because of that  Greece raised the issue of possible territorial aspirations and also historical concerns regarding the association of the country with the history of the Greek region  From 1992 to 1995  the two countries also engaged in a dispute over the Macedonian state s first flag  which incorporated the Vergina Sun symbol  a symbol associated with the ancient Kingdom of Macedon  This aspect of the dispute was resolved when the flag was changed under the terms of an interim accord agreed between the two states in October 1995  The first flag of sovereign Macedonia  1991 1995  was also part of the dispute with Greece  The UN adopted the provisional reference  the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia   Macedonian                                                when the country was admitted to the organization in 1993  65  Most international organizations  such as the European Union  the European Broadcasting Union  and the International Olympic Committee  adopted the same convention  66  67  68  69  70 NATO also uses the reference in official documents but adds an explanation on which member countries recognize the constitutional name  71  The same reference is also used in any discussion to which Greece is a party 72  However  most UN member countries have abandoned the provisional reference and have recognised the country as the Republic of Macedonia instead  These include four of the five permanent UN Security Council members the United States  73 Russia  United Kingdom and the People s Republic of China  several members of the European Union such as Bulgaria  Poland  and Slovenia  and over 100 other UN members  74  The UN has set up a negotiating process with a mediator  Matthew Nimetz  and the two disputed parties  Macedonia and Greece  to try to mediate the dispute  Negotiations continue between the two sides but have yet to reach any settlement of the dispute  Initially the European Community nominated Arbitration Commission s opinion was that  the use of the name  Macedonia  cannot therefore imply any territorial claim against another State   75  despite the commission s opinion  Greece continued to object to the establishment of relations between the Community and the Republic under its constitutional name  76  Since the coming to power in 2006  and especially since Macedonia s non invitation to NATO in 2008  the VMRO DPMNE government has pursued a policy of  Antiquisation    Antikvizatzija   as a way of putting pressure on Greece as well as for the purposes of domestic identity building  77  Statues of Alexander the Great and Philip of Macedon have been built in several cities across the country  Additionally  many pieces of public infrastructure  such as airports  highways  and stadiums have been renamed after Alexander and Philip  These actions are seen as deliberate provocations in neighboring Greece  exacerbating the dispute and further stalling Macedonia s EU and NATO applications  78  The policy has also attracted criticism domestically  as well as from EU diplomats  77  In November 2008  Macedonia instituted proceedings before the International Court of Justice  ICJ  against Greece alleging violations of the 1995 Interim Accord that blocked its accession to NATO  79  The ICJ is requested to order Greece to observe its obligations within the Accord  which is legally binding for both countries  The Macedonian side asserts that Article 11 of the 1995 accord obliges Greece not to object to Macedonia s application to join NATO and other international organizations  except if the country is going to be referred to in such organization with a name different than the provisional reference  80  In April 2009  the President elect Gjorge Ivanov and opposition leader Zaev held a meeting about the name issue  Ivanov called for a state strategy regarding the negotiations with Greece on the name issue and also called for a reasonable compromise that will not bring harm to Macedonia s interests  The SDSM accepts a name with a geographic determinant that will replace the reference FYROM in the organizations where it is currently used and guarantee the country s constitutional name  national identity and language  81  The government of Greece expressed support for the name  Republic of North Macedonia  as the basis for resolving the name issue  82  In 2010  the Macedonian Human Rights Movement International  MHRMI  and the Australian Macedonian Human Rights Committee  AMHRC  have launched a campaign placing advertisements in newspapers and billboards across Macedonia  demanding an end to all negotiations with Greece over its name   83  The United Nations  International Court of Justice ruled that Greece violated Article 11 of the 1995 Interim Accord by vetoing Macedonia s bid for NATO membership at the 2008 summit in Bucharest  84  The court however did not grant Macedonia s request that it instruct Greece to refrain from similar actions in the future  nor has there been to date a change in the EU s stance that Macedonia s accession negotiations cannot begin until the name issue is resolved  85  Human rights Main article  Human rights in the Republic of Macedonia The Republic of Macedonia is a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights and the U N  Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and Convention against Torture  and the Macedonian Constitution guarantees basic human rights to all Macedonian citizens  There do however continue to be problems with human rights  According to human rights organisations  in 2003 there were suspected extrajudicial executions  threats and intimidation against human rights activists and opposition journalists and allegations of torture by the police  86  87  The country has problems with the human rights of its ethnic minorities  Although Albanians have recently been allowed to study in the Albanian language  before graduating from university they are required to pass a test of their comprehension and use of the Macedonian language  88  Military Main article  Military of the Republic of Macedonia Macedonian Air Force Mi 24 helicopter The Macedonian Armed Forces comprise the army  air force and Special Forces

Macedonia has undergone considerable economic reform since independence  90  The country has developed an open economy with trade accounting for more than 90  of GDP in recent years  Since 1996  Macedonia has witnessed steady  though slow  economic growth with GDP growing by 3 1  in 2005  This figure was projected to rise to an average of 5 2  in the 2006 2010 period  91  The government has proven successful in its efforts to combat inflation  with an inflation rate of only 3  in 2006 and 2  in 2007 90  and has implemented policies focused on attracting foreign investment and promoting the development of Small and Medium sized Enterprises  SMEs   The current government introduced a flat tax system with the intention of making the country more attractive to foreign investment  The flat tax rate was 12  in 2007 and was further lowered to 10  in 2008  92  93  Despite these reforms  as of 2005 Macedonia s unemployment rate was 37 2  94  and as of 2006 its poverty rate was 22   91  Macedonia has one of the highest shares of people struggling financially  with 72  of its citizens stating that they could only manage on their household s income  with difficulty  or  with great difficulty   though Macedonia  along with Croatia  was the only country in the Western Balkans to not report an increase in this statistic  95  Corruption and a relatively ineffective legal system also act as significant restraints on successful economic development  Macedonia still has one of the lowest per capita GDPs in Europe  Furthermore  the country s grey market is estimated at close to 20  of GDP  96  In terms of structure  as of 2005 the service sector constituted by far the largest part of GDP at 57 1   up from 54 2  in 2000  The industrial sector represents 29 3  of GDP  down from 33 7  in 2000 while agriculture represents only 12 9   up from 12   97  Textiles represent the most significant sector for trade  accounting for more than half of total exports  98  Other important exports include iron  steel  wine and vegetables  99  With a GDP per capita of  9 157 at purchasing power parity and a Human Development Index of 0 701  Macedonia is less developed and has a considerably smaller economy than most of the former Yugoslav states  According to Eurostat data  Macedonian PPS GDP per capita stood at 36 per cent of the EU average in 2010  100  Some attractions of the country  Black Drim river  top    the village of Gali nik  middle   mosaic at Heraclea Lyncestis  bottom   Infrastructure and e infrastructure Macedonia  together with Montenegro  Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo  belonged to the less developed southern region of the former Yugoslavia  It suffered severe economic difficulties after independence  when the Yugoslav internal market collapsed and subsidies from Belgrade ended  In addition  it faced many of the same problems faced by other former socialist East European countries during the transition to a market economy  Its main land and rail exports route  through Serbia  remains unreliable with high transit costs  thereby affecting the export of its formerly highly profitable  early vegetables market to Germany  Macedonia s IT market increased 63 8  year on year in 2007  which is the Fastest Growing in the Adriatic Region  101  Trade and investment The outbreak of the Yugoslav wars and the imposition of sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro caused great damage to the Republic s economy  with Serbia constituting 60  of its markets prior to the disintegration of Yugoslavia  When Greece imposed a trade embargo on the Republic in 1994 95  the economy was also affected  Some relief was afforded by the end of the Bosnian war in November 1995 and the lifting of the Greek embargo  but the Kosovo War of 1999 and the 2001 Albanian crisis caused further destabilisation  Since the end of the Greek embargo  Greece has become the country s most important business partner   See also  Greek investments in the Republic of Macedonia   Many Greek companies have bought former state companies in Macedonia  102  such as the oil refinery Okta  the baking company Zhito Luks  a marble mine in Prilep  textile facilities in Bitola etc   and employ 20 000 people  However  local cross border trade between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia sees thousands of Greek shoppers crossing the border to purchase cheaper domestic

churches were suspended  the Serbian Orthodox Church recognised a group led by Zoran Vrani kovski  also known as Archbishop Jovan of Ohrid  a former Macedonian church bishop  as the Archbishop of Ohrid  The reaction of the Macedonian Orthodox Church was to cut off all relations with the new Ohrid Archbishopric and to prevent bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church from entering Macedonia
