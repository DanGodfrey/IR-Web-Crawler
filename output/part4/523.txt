Technological and industrial history Territorial evolution Women s history United States Portal v t e The colonial history of the United States covers the history from the start of European settlement and the Thirteen Colonies of the British Empire until they declared their independence as the United States of America in 1776  In the late 16th century  England  France  Spain and the Netherlands launched major colonization programs in eastern North America  1  Many early attempts notably the English Lost Colony of Roanoke ended in failure  and everywhere the death rate of the first arrivals was very high  but key successful colonies were established  European settlers came from a variety of social and religious groups  No aristocrats settled permanently  but a number of adventurers  soldiers  farmers  and tradesmen arrived  Ethnic diversity was an American characteristic as the Dutch of New Netherland  the Swedes and Finns of New Sweden  the English Quakers of Pennsylvania  the English Puritans of New England  the English settlers of Jamestown  and the  worthy poor  of Georgia  came to the new continent and built colonies with distinctive social  religious  political and economic styles  Occasionally one colony took control of another  during wars between their European parents   but unlike in Nova Scotia they did not expel the previous inhabitants  but instead lived side by side in peace  There were no major civil wars among the 13 colonies  and the two chief armed rebellions  in Virginia and New York  were short lived failures  The four distinct regions were  New England  the Middle Colonies  the Chesapeake Bay Colonies  Upper South  and the Lower South  Some historians add a fifth region  the frontier  which was never separately organized  1  By the time European settlers arrived around 1600 1650  the majority of the Native Americans living in the eastern United States had been decimated by new diseases  introduced to them decades before by explorers and sailors  2  For a timeline of the colonial history of the United States  see Timeline of Colonial America  Contents 1 Goals of colonization 1 1 Mercantilism 1 2 Religious persecution 2 Early

experience of conquest and colonization during the Reconquista  coupled with new oceanic ship navigation skills  provided the tools  ability  and desire to colonize the New World  England  France and the Netherlands started colonies in both the West Indies and North America  They had the ability to build ocean worthy ships  but did not have as strong a history of colonization in foreign lands as did Spain  However  English entrepreneurs gave their colonies a base of merchant based investment that needed much less government support  3   edit  Mercantilism Mercantilism was the basic policy imposed by Britain on its colonies from the 1660s  Mercantilism meant that the government and merchants based in England became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth  to the exclusion of other empires and even merchants based in its own colonies  The government protected its London based merchants and kept others out by trade barriers  regulations  and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm  The government had to fight smuggling  especially by American merchants  some of whose activities  which included direct trade with the French  Spanish  Dutch  and Portuguese  were classified as such by the Navigation Acts  The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses  so that gold and silver would pour into London  The government took its share through duties and taxes  with the remainder going to merchants in Britain  The government spent much of its revenue on a superb Royal Navy  which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires  and sometimes seized them  Thus the British Navy captured New Amsterdam  New York  in 1664  The colonies were captive markets for British industry  and the goal was to enrich the mother country  4   edit  Religious persecution The prospect of religious persecution by authorities of the crown and the Church of England prompted a significant number of colonization efforts  People fleeing persecution by King Charles I and Anglican Archbishop William Laud were responsible for settling most of New England  and the Province of Maryland was founded in part to be a haven for Roman Catholics   edit  Early colonial failures Numerous failed colonies were attempted they died because of disease  starvation or wars with Indians or other European powers  Spain had numerous failed attempts  including Lucas V zquez de Ayll n in Georgia in 1526  P nfilo de Narv ez in Florida in 1528 36  Pensacola in West Florida 1559 61  Fort San Juan in North Carolina 1567 68  and the Ajacan Mission 1570 71  in Virginia  1  The French failed at Parris Island  South Carolina in 1562 63  Fort Caroline  Florida  in 1564 65  Saint Croix Island  Maine 1604 5  1  and Fort Saint Louis  Texas in 1685 89  The most notable English failures were the  Lost Colony of Roanoke   1587 90  in North Carolina and Popham Colony in Maine  1607 8   It was at the Roanoke Colony that the first English child  Virginia Dare  was born in the Americas  her fate is unknown  The Kingdom of Scotland tried to establish a colony in Central America called  New Caledonia  in the 1690s  it was a total failure   edit  Spanish colonies At one time  Spain claimed and controlled North America west of the Mississippi and south of the Canadian border  Additionally  Spain claimed what are now the states of Louisiana  Florida  and parts of Georgia and Mississippi   edit  Florida Main article  History of Florida Spain established several small outposts in Florida  The most important  St  Augustine  Florida  founded in 1565  was repeatedly attacked and burned  but was the first permanent European settlement in what is now the continental United States  Pirate attacks were unrelenting against small outposts as well as St  Augustine  The British and their colonies repeatedly made war with Spain and its colonies and outposts  South Carolina launched large scale raiding expeditions in the early 18th century  which effectively destroyed the Spanish mission system  St  Augustine and Pensacola survived  but English allied Indians such as the Yamasee conducted slave raids throughout Florida  killing or enslaving most of the region s natives  1  In the mid 18th century  invading Seminoles from Georgia killed most of the remaining local Indians  Florida had about 3 000 Spaniards when Britain took control in 1763  Nearly all quickly left  Even though control was restored to Spain in 1783  Spain sent no more settlers or missionaries to Florida  The United States took possession in 1819  5   edit  New Mexico Main article  History of New Mexico Throughout the 16th century  Spain explored the southwest from Mexico with the most notable explorer being Francisco Coronado whose expedition rode throughout modern New Mexico  Arizona  southern Colorado  the panhandle of Oklahoma  and Kansas  The first colonization was under Don Juan de O ate in 1598 where the first settlement in San Juan de Los Caballeros near Espa ola  New Mexico and later Santa Fe  New Mexico around 1609  The second colonization came in 1692 under Diego de Vargas  after the Pueblo Revolt briefly drove the Spanish out   Ownership was by Spain  223 years  and Mexico  25 years  until 1846  when the American Army of the West took over in the Mexican American War  About of a third of the population clarification needed  in the 21st century descends from the Spanish settlers  1  6  page needed   edit  California Main article  History of

sailed along the coast of present day California from the early 16th century to the mid 18th century  but no settlements were established over those centuries  Spain  from 1769 until the independence of Mexico in 1820  sent missionaries and soldiers to Alta California who created a series of Franciscan missions  accompanied by presidios  forts   pueblos  settlements s  and ranchos  land grant ranches   along the southern and central coast of California  Father Jun pero Serra  a Franciscan missionary  founded the first missions in Spanish upper Las Californias  starting with Mission San Diego de Alcal  in 1769  Through the Spanish and Mexican eras they eventually comprised a series of 21 missions to spread Christianity among the local Native Americans  linked by El Camino Real   The Royal Road    They were established to convert the indigenous peoples of California  while protecting historic Spanish claims to the area  The missions introduced European technology  livestock  and crops  The Indian Reductions  converted  the native peoples into groups of Mission Indians  which also forced many from their ancestral homelands and cultures  to be laborers in the missions and on their  and the ranchos  surrounding lands  6  page needed  At the time of the 1846 U S  acquisition of California as a territory from Mexico  the missions had previously been secularized and their lands transferred to hundreds of Mexican land grant ranchos from Northern to Southern California  The indigenous Native American population was around 150 000  the Californios  Mexican era Californians  around 10 000  with the rest immigrant Americans and other nationalities involved in trade and business in California   edit  New Mexico Further information  Santa Fe de Nuevo M xico and

Island   Although all of these territories would come under British control in the 18th century  only portions of Canada and Louisiana became parts of the United States   edit  Pays d en Haut By 1660  French fur trappers based in Montreal pushed west along the Great Lakes and founded Green Bay  Saint Ignace  Sault Sainte Marie  Vincennes  and Detroit in 1701  By 1773  the population of Detroit was

when 7 000 French immigrants arrived in New Orleans in 1718  9  The areas around New Orleans and west of the Mississippi were given to Spain in 1760  10  Louisiana was taken back by France in 1800

Nieuw Nederland  or New Netherland  chartered in 1614  was a colonial province of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands in what became New York State and parts of Connecticut  New Jersey  Pennsylvania and Delaware  The peak population was less than 10 000  The Dutch established a patroon system with feudal like rights given to a few powerful landholders  they also established religious tolerance and free trade  The colony s capital  New Amsterdam  founded in 1625 and located at the southern tip of the island of Manhattan  would grow to become a major world city  The city was captured by the English in 1664  they took complete control of the colony in 1674 and renamed it New York  However the Dutch landholdings remained  and the Hudson River Valley maintained a traditional Dutch character until the 1820s  12  13   edit  New Sweden Main article  Swedish colonization of the Americas Map of New Sweden by Amandus Johnson New Sweden  Swedish  Nya Sverige  was a Swedish colony along the Delaware River Valley from 1638 to 1655  The few hundred settlers huddled around Fort Christina  It was captured by the Dutch in 1655 and merged into New Netherland  and most traces of Swedish culture faded away  14   edit  Russian colonies Main articles  Russian Alaska and Russian colonization of the Americas Russia explored the area that became Alaska starting with the Second Kamchatka expedition in the 1730s and early 1740s  Their first settlement was founded in 1784 by Grigory Shelikhov  15  The Russian American Company was formed in 1799 with the influence of Nikolay Rezanov for the purpose of buying sea otters for their fur from native hunters  In 1867 the U S  purchased Alaska and nearly all Russians left except a few missionaries of the Russian Orthodox Church working among the natives  16   edit  English colonies See also  British America and Thirteen Colonies The 1606 grants by James I to the London and Plymouth companies  The overlapping area  yellow  was granted to both companies on the stipulation that neither found a settlement within 100 miles  160 km  of each other  The location of the Jamestown Settlement is shown by  J  England made its first successful efforts at the start of the 17th century for several reasons  During this era  English proto nationalism and national assertiveness blossomed under the threat of Spanish invasion  assisted by a degree of Protestant militarism and the energy of Queen Elizabeth  At this time  however  there was no official attempt by the English government to create a colonial empire  Rather  the motivation behind the founding of colonies was piecemeal and variable  Practical considerations  such as commercial enterprise  overpopulation and the desire for freedom of religion  played their parts  The main waves of settlement came in the 17th century  After 1700 most immigrants to Colonial America arrived as indentured servants young unmarried men and women seeking a new life in a much richer environment  17  Between the late 1610s and the American Revolution  the British shipped an estimated 50 000 convicts to its American colonies  18  The first convicts to arrive pre dated the arrival of the Mayflower   edit  Chesapeake Bay area Main articles  Jamestown  Virginia  Colony of Virginia  and Province of Maryland  edit  Virginia The first successful English colony was Jamestown  established in 1607 near Chesapeake Bay  The business venture was financed and coordinated by the London Virginia Company  a joint stock company looking for gold  Its first years were extremely difficult  with very high death rates from disease and starvation  wars with local Indians  and little gold  The colony survived and flourished by turning to tobacco as a cash crop  By the late 17th century  Virginia s export economy was largely based on tobacco  and new  richer settlers came in to take up large portions of land  build large plantations and import indentured servants and slaves  In 1676  Bacon s Rebellion occurred  but was suppressed by royal officials  After Bacon s Rebellion  African slaves rapidly replaced indentured servants as Virginia s main labor force  19  20  The colonial assembly shared power with a royally appointed governor  On a more local level  governmental power was invested in county courts  which were self perpetuating  the incumbents filled any vacancies and there never were popular elections   As cash crop producers  Chesapeake plantations were heavily dependent on trade with England  With easy navigation by river  there were few towns and no cities  planters shipped directly to Britain  High death rates and a very young population profile characterized the colony during its first years  20   edit  New England Main articles  Connecticut Colony  Plymouth Colony  Massachusetts Bay Colony  Province of New Hampshire  and Colony of Rhode Island  edit  Puritans Main article  Puritan The Puritans  a much larger group than the Pilgrims  established the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1629 with 400 settlers  They sought to reform the Church of England by creating a new  pure church in the New World  By 1640  20 000 had arrived  many died soon after arrival  but the others found a healthy climate and an ample food supply  The Massachusetts settlement spawned other Puritan colonies in New England  including the New Haven  Saybrook  and Connecticut colonies  During the 17th century the New Haven and Saybrook colonies were absorbed by Connecticut  The Puritans created a deeply religious  socially tight knit  and politically innovative culture that still influences the modern United States  21  They hoped this new land would serve as a  redeemer nation   They fled England and in America attempted to create a  nation of saints  or a  City upon a Hill   an intensely religious  thoroughly righteous community designed to be an example for all of Europe  Roger Williams  who preached religious toleration  separation of Church and State  and a complete break with the Church of England  was banished and founded Rhode Island Colony  which became a haven for other refugees from the Puritan community  such as Anne Hutchinson  22  Economically  Puritan New England fulfilled the expectations of its founders  Unlike the cash crop oriented plantations of the Chesapeake region  the Puritan economy was based on the efforts of self supporting farmsteads who traded only for goods they could not produce themselves  23  There was a generally higher economic standing and standard of living in New England than in the Chesapeake  Along with agriculture  fishing  and logging  New England became an important mercantile and shipbuilding center  serving as the hub for trading between the southern colonies and Europe  24   edit  Other New England The Pilgrims were a small Protestant sect based in England and the Netherlands  One group sailed on the Mayflower and settled in Plymouth  Massachusetts in 1620  After drawing up the Mayflower Compact by which they gave themselves broad powers of self governance  they established the small Plymouth Colony  William Bradford was their main leader  Providence Plantation was founded in 1636 by Rev  Roger Williams on land provided by the Narragansett sachem Canonicus  Williams  fleeing from religious persecution in the Massachusetts Bay Colony  agreed with his fellow settlers on an egalitarian constitution providing for majority rule  in civil things  and  liberty of conscience   19  Other colonists who disagreed with Puritans in Massachusetts settled to the north  mingling with adventurers and profit oriented settlers to establish more religiously diverse colonies in New Hampshire and Maine  These small settlements were absorbed by Massachusetts when it made significant land claims in the 1640s and 1650s  but New Hampshire was eventually given a separate charter in 1679   Maine remained a part of Massachusetts until achieving statehood in 1820    edit  Dominion of New England Under King James II of England  the New England colonies  as well as New York and the Jerseys  were briefly united as the Dominion of New England  1686 89   The administration eventually led by Governor Sir Edmund Andros seized colonial charters  revoked land titles  and ruled without local assemblies  causing anger among the population  The 1689 Boston revolt  inspired by England s Glorious Revolution against James II  caused Andros  Boston Anglicans  and senior dominion officials to be arrested by the Massachusetts militia  Andros was jailed for several months  then returned to England  The Dominion of New England was dissolved and governments resumed under their earlier charters  25  However  the Massachusetts charter had been revoked in 1684  and a new one was issued in 1691 that combined Massachusetts and Plymouth into the Province of Massachusetts Bay  Although King William III sought at least to unite the New England colonies militarily  for example  by appointing the Earl of Bellomont to three simultaneous governorships  and military command over Connecticut and Rhode Island   these attempts at unified control failed   edit  Middle Colonies Main article  Middle Colonies The Middle Colonies  consisting of the present day states of New York  New Jersey  Pennsylvania  and Delaware  were characterized by a large degree of diversity religious  political  economic  and ethnic  The Dutch colony of New Netherland was taken over by the British and renamed New York but large numbers of Dutch remained in the colony  New Jersey began as a division of New York  and was for a time divided into the proprietary colonies of East and West Jersey  Many German and Irish immigrants settled in these areas  as well as in Connecticut  A large portion of the settlers who came to Pennsylvania were German  24  Philadelphia became the center of the colonies  by the end of the colonial period 30 000 people lived there  having come from diverse nations and practicing numerous trades  Pennsylvania was founded in 1681 as a proprietary colony of the Quaker William Penn  It came to include the territory of Delaware  which had once been part of New Netherland  Delaware had a government independent of that established in Philadelphia  but was never a separate colony   edit  Lower South The colonial South included the plantation colonies of the Chesapeake region  Virginia  Maryland  and  by some classifications  Delaware  and the lower South  Carolina  which eventually split into North and South Carolina  and Georgia   24   edit  Carolinas Main articles  Province of Carolina  Province of North Carolina  and Province of South Carolina The first attempted English settlement south of Virginia was the Province of Carolina  It was a private venture  financed by a group of English Lords Proprietors  who obtained a Royal Charter to the Carolinas in 1663  hoping that a new colony in the south would become profitable like Jamestown  Carolina was not settled until 1670  and even then the first attempt failed because there was no incentive for emigration to that area  Eventually  however  the Lords combined their remaining capital and financed a settlement mission to the area  a mission led by Sir John Colleton  The expedition located fertile and defensible ground at what was to become Charleston  originally Charles Town for Charles II of England   thus beginning the English colonization of the mainland  The original settlers in South Carolina established a lucrative trade in provisions  deerskins and Indian captives with the Caribbean islands  The settlers came mainly from the English colony of Barbados and brought African slaves with them  Barbados  as a wealthy sugarcane plantation island  was one of the early English colonies to use large numbers of Africans in plantation style agriculture  The cultivation of rice was introduced during the 1690s via Africans from the rice growing regions of Africa  North Carolina remained a frontier throughout the early colonial period  24  At first  South Carolina was politically divided  Its ethnic makeup included the original settlers  a group of rich  slave owning English settlers from the island of Barbados  and Huguenots  a French speaking community of Protestants  Nearly continuous frontier warfare during the era of King William s War and Queen Anne s War drove economic and political wedges between merchants and planters  The disaster of the 1715 Yamasee War  which threatened the colony s viability  set off a decade of political turmoil  By 1729  the proprietary government had collapsed  and the Proprietors sold both colonies back to the British crown  24   edit  Georgia Main article  Province of Georgia Savannah  Georgia Colony  early 18th century James Oglethorpe  an 18th century British Member of Parliament  established the Georgia Colony in 1733 as a common solution to two problems  At that time  tension between Spain and Great Britain was high  and the British feared that Spanish Florida was threatening the British Carolinas  Oglethorpe decided to establish a colony in the contested border region of Georgia and populate it with debtors who would otherwise have been imprisoned according to standard British practice  This plan would both rid Great Britain of its undesirable elements and provide her with a base from which to attack Florida  The first colonists arrived in 1733  24  Georgia was established on strict moralistic principles  Slavery was forbidden  as were alcohol and other forms of supposed immorality  However  the reality of the colony was far from ideal  The colonists were unhappy about the puritanical lifestyle and complained that their colony could not compete economically with the Carolina rice plantations  Georgia initially failed to prosper  but eventually the restrictions were lifted  slavery was allowed  and it became as prosperous as the Carolinas  The colony of Georgia never had a specific religion  It consisted of people of various faiths   edit  East and West Florida Main articles  East Florida and West Florida In 1763  Spain ceded Florida to Great Britain  which established the colonies of East and West Florida  The Floridas remained loyal to Great Britain during the American Revolution  They were returned to Spain in 1783  in exchange for the Bahamas   at which time most of the British left  The Spanish then neglected the Floridas  few Spaniards lived there when the US bought the area in 1819  1   edit  British colonial government Each colony had a paid colonial agent in London to represent its interests  The three forms of colonial government in 1776 were provincial  proprietary  and charter  These governments were all subordinate to the king in London  with no explicit relationship with the British Parliament  Beginning late in the 17th century  the administration of all British colonies was overseen by a Board of Trade   edit  Provincial colonies New Hampshire  New York  Virginia  North Carolina  South Carolina  Georgia  and eventually Massachusetts  were provincial colonies  The provincial government was governed by commissions created at pleasure by the monarch  A governor  and in some provinces his council  were appointed by the crown  The governor was invested with general executive powers  and authorized to call a locally elected assembly  The governor s council would sit as an upper house when the assembly was in session in addition to its role in advising the governor  Assemblies were made up of representatives elected by the freeholders and planters  landowners  of the province  The governor had the power of absolute veto  and could prorogue  i e   delay  and dissolve the assembly  The assembly s role was to make all local laws and ordinances  ensuring that they were not inconsistent with the laws of England  In practice this did not always occur  since many of the provincial assemblies sought to expand their powers and limit those of the governor and crown  Laws could be examined by the Board of Trade  which also held veto power of legislation   edit  Proprietary colonies Pennsylvania  which included Delaware   New Jersey  and Maryland were proprietary colonies  They were governed much as royal colonies except that lord proprietors  rather than the king  appointed the governor  They were set up after the Restoration of 1660 and typically enjoyed greater civil and religious liberty  26   edit  Charter colonies Massachusetts  Rhode Island and Providence Plantation  and Connecticut were charter colonies  The Massachusetts charter was revoked in 1684  and was replaced by a provincial charter that was issued in 1691  Charter governments were political corporations created by letters patent  giving the grantees control of the land and the powers of legislative government  The charters provided a fundamental constitution and divided powers among legislative  executive  and judicial functions  with those powers being vested in officials  27   edit  Political culture As Bonomi  1971  shows  the most distinctive feature of colonial society was the vibrant political culture  which attracted the most talented and ambitious young men into politics  28  First  suffrage was the most widespread in the world  with every man who owned a certain amount of property allowed to vote  29  While fewer than 1  of British men could vote  a majority of white American men were eligible  The roots of democracy were present  30  although deference was typically shown to social elites in colonial elections  31  Second  in the colonies a very wide range of public and private business was decided by elected bodies  especially the assemblies and county governments in each colony  32  They handled land grants  commercial subsidies  and taxation  as well as oversight of roads  poor relief  taverns  and schools  33  Americans sued each other at a very high rate  with binding decisions made not by a great lord but by local judges and juries  This promoted the rapid expansion of the legal profession  so that the intense involvement of lawyers in politics became an American characteristic by the 1770s  34  Thirdly  the American colonies were exceptional in the world because of the representation of many different interest groups in political decision making  Unlike Europe  where aristocratic families and the established church were in control  the American political culture was open to economic  social  religious  ethnic and geographical interests  with merchants  landlords  petty farmers  artisans  Anglicans  Presbyterians  Quakers  Germans  Scotch Irish  Yankees  Yorkers  and many other identifiable groups taking part  Elected representatives learned to listen to these interests because 90  of the men in the lower houses lived in their districts  unlike England where it was common to have a member of Parliament and absentee member of Parliament  35  Finally  and most dramatically  the Americans were fascinated by and increasingly adopted the political values of Republicanism  which stressed equal rights  the need for virtuous citizens  and the evils of corruption  luxury  and aristocracy  36  37  Republicanism provided the framework for colonial resistance to British schemes of taxation after 1763  which escalated into the Revolution  None of the colonies had stable political parties of the sort that formed in the 1790s  but each had shifting factions that vied for power  especially in the perennial battles between the appointed governor and the elected assembly  38  There were often  country  and  court  factions  representing those opposed and in favor  respectively  of the governor s actions and agenda  Massachusetts  which from its 1691 charter had particularly low requirements for voting eligibility and strong rural representation in its assembly  also had a strong populist faction that represented the province s lower classes  Up and down the colonies non English ethnic groups had clusters of settlements  The most numerous were the Scotch Irish 39  and the Germans  40  Each group assimilated into the dominant English  Protestant commercial and political culture  albeit with local variations  They tended to vote in blocs and politicians negotiated with group leaders for votes  They generally retained their historic languages and cultural traditions  even as they merged into the emerging American culture  41  Ethnocultural factors were most visible in Pennsylvania  During 1756 76  the Quakers were the largest faction in the legislature  but they were losing their dominance to the emerging Presbyterian faction based on Scotch Irish votes  supported by Germans  42   edit  Unification of the British colonies  edit  A common defense Main article  Colonial American military history Efforts at common defense of the colonies  principally against shared threats from Indians  the French  and the Dutch  began as early as the 1640s  when the Puritan colonies of New England formed a confederation to coordinate military and judicial matters  From the 1670s several royal governors  notably Sir Edmund Andros  who at various times governed New York  New England  and Virginia  and Francis Nicholson  governed Maryland  Virginia  Nova Scotia  and Carolina  proposed or attempted to implement means to coordinate defensive and offensive military matters  After King Phillips War  Andros successfully negotiated the Covenant Chain  a series of Indian treaties that brought relative calm to the frontiers of the middle colonies for many years  The northern colonies  particularly present day Maine and New Hampshire  experience numerous assaults from the Wabanaki Confederacy and the French from Acadia during the four French and Indian Wars as well as Father Rale s War and Father Le Loutre s War  One event that reminded colonists of their shared identity as British subjects was the War of the Austrian Succession  1740 1748  in Europe  This conflict spilled over into the colonies  where it was known as  King George s War   The major battles took place in Europe  but American colonial troops fought the French and their Indian allies in New York  New England  and Nova Scotia  At the Albany Congress of 1754  Benjamin Franklin proposed that the colonies be united by a Grand Council overseeing a common policy for defense  expansion  and Indian affairs  While the plan was thwarted by colonial legislatures and King George II  it was an early indication that the British colonies of North America were headed towards unification  43   edit  French and Indian War Main article  French and Indian War George Washington during the French and Indian War Benjamin Franklin s political cartoon calling for colonial unity during the French and Indian War  it would be used again during the American Revolution  The French and Indian War  1754 1763  was the American extension of the general European conflict known as the Seven Years  War  Although previous colonial wars in North America had started in Europe and then spread to the colonies  the French and Indian War is notable for having started in North America and then having spread to Europe  Increasing competition between Britain and France  especially in the Great Lakes and Ohio valley  was one of the primary origins of the war  44  The French and Indian War took on a new significance for the British North American colonists when William Pitt the Elder decided that  in order to win the war against France  major military resources needed to be devoted to North America  For the first time  the continent became one of the main theaters of what could be termed a  world war   During the war  the position of the British colonies as part of the British Empire was made truly apparent  as British military and civilian officials took on an increased presence in the lives of Americans  The war also increased a sense of American unity in other ways  It caused men  who might normally have never left their own colony  to travel across the continent  fighting alongside men from decidedly different  yet still  American   backgrounds  Throughout the course of the war  British officers trained American ones  most notably George Washington  for battle which would later benefit the American Revolution  Also  colonial legislatures and officials had to cooperate intensively  for the first time  in pursuit of the continent wide military effort  44  The relations between the British military establishment and the colonists were not always positive  setting the stage for later distrust and dislike of British troops  Territorial changes following the French and Indian War  land held by the British before 1763 is shown in red  land gained by Britain in 1763 is shown in pink  In the Treaty of Paris  1763   France formally ceded the eastern part of its vast North American empire to Britain  having secretly given the territory of Louisiana west of the Mississippi River to Spain the previous year   Before the war  Britain held the thirteen American colonies  most of present day Nova Scotia  and most of the Hudson Bay watershed  Following the war  Britain gained all French territory east of the Mississippi River  including Quebec  the Great Lakes  and the Ohio River valley  Britain also gained Spanish Florida  from which it formed the colonies of East and West Florida  In removing a major foreign threat to the thirteen colonies  the war also largely removed the colonists  need of colonial protection  The British and colonists triumphed jointly over a common foe  The colonists  loyalty to the mother country was stronger than ever before  However  disunity was beginning to form  British Prime Minister William Pitt the Elder had decided to wage the war in the colonies with the use of troops from the colonies and tax funds from Britain itself  This was a successful wartime strategy  but after the war was over  each side believed that it had borne a greater burden than the other  The British elite  the most heavily taxed of any in Europe  pointed out angrily that the colonists paid little to the royal coffers  The colonists replied that their sons had fought and died in a war that served European interests more than their own  This dispute was a link in the chain of events that soon brought about the American Revolution  44   edit  Ties to the British Empire Although the colonies were very different from one another  they were still a part of the British Empire in more than just name  Socially  the colonial elite of Boston  New York  Charleston  and Philadelphia saw their identity as British  Although many had never been to Britain  they imitated British styles of dress  dance  and etiquette  This social upper echelon built its mansions in the Georgian style  copied the furniture designs of Thomas Chippendale  and participated in the intellectual currents of Europe  such as the Enlightenment  To many of their inhabitants  the seaport cities of colonial America were truly British cities  45   edit  Republicanism Many of the political structures of the colonies drew upon the republicanism expressed by opposition leaders in Britain  most notably the Commonwealth men and the Whig traditions  Many Americans at the time saw the colonies  systems of governance as modeled after the British constitution of the time  with the king corresponding to the governor  the House of Commons to the colonial assembly  and the House of Lords to the Governor s council  The codes of law of the colonies were often drawn directly from English law  indeed  English common law survives not only in Canada  but also throughout the United States  Eventually  it was a dispute over the meaning of some of these political ideals  especially political representation  and republicanism that led to the American Revolution  46   edit  Consumption Another point on which the colonies found themselves more similar than different was the booming import of British goods  The British economy had begun to grow rapidly at the end of the 17th century  and by the mid 18th century  small factories in Britain were producing much more than the nation could consume  Finding a market for their goods in the British colonies of North America  Britain increased her exports to that region by 360  between 1740 and 1770  Because British merchants offered generous credit to their customers  citation needed  Americans began buying staggering amounts of British goods  From Nova Scotia to Georgia  all British subjects bought similar products  creating and anglicizing a sort of common identity  45   edit  Atlantic world In recent years historians have enlarged their perspective to cover the entire Atlantic world in a subfield now known as Atlantic history  47  48  Of special interest are such themes as international migration  trade  colonization  comparative military and governmental institutions  the transmission of religions and missionary work  and the slave trade  It was the Age of the Enlightenment  and ideas flowed back and forth across the Atlantic  with Philadelphian Benjamin Franklin playing a major role  Warfare was critical  for as Furstenberg   2008  explains  from 1754 to 1815  the major imperial players   Britain  the American colonies  Spain  France  the First Nations  Indians  and the United States fought a series of conflicts that can be called a  Long War for the West  over control of the region  49  Women played a role in the emergence of the capitalist economy in the Atlantic world  The types of local commercial exchange in which they participated independently   especially markets in dairy and produce commodities   were well integrated with the trade networks between colonial merchants throughout the Atlantic region  For example  local women merchants were important suppliers of foodstuffs to transatlantic shipping concerns  50   edit  Tax protests lead to Revolution Main article  American Revolution In the colonial era  Americans insisted on their rights as Englishmen to have their own legislature raise all taxes  Tax loads in practice were very light  and far lower than in England  Beginning in 1765 the British Parliament asserted its supreme authority to lay taxes  and a series of American protests began that led directly to the American Revolution  The first wave of protests attacked the Stamp Act of 1765  and marked the first time Americans from each of the 13 colonies met together and planned a common front against illegal taxes  The Boston Tea Party of 1773 dumped British tea into Boston Harbor because it contained a hidden tax Americans refused to pay  The British responded by trying to crush traditional liberties in Massachusetts  leading to the American revolution starting in 1775  51  The Parliament attempted a series of taxes and punishments which met more and more resistance  First Quartering Act  1765   Declaratory Act  1766   Townshend Revenue Act  1767   and Tea Act  1773   In response to the Boston Tea Party Parliament passed the Intolerable Acts  Second Quartering Act  1774   Quebec Act  1774   Massachusetts Government Act  1774   Administration of Justice Act  1774   Boston Port Act  1774   Prohibitory Act  1775   By this point the 13 colonies had organized themselves into the Continental Congress and began setting up shadow governments and drilling their militia in preparation for war  52   edit  Colonial life  edit  New England In New England  the Puritans created self governing communities of religious congregations of farmers  or yeomen  and their families  High level politicians gave out plots of land to male settlers  or proprietors  who then divided the land amongst themselves  Large portions were usually given to men of higher social standing  but every white man who wasn t indentured or criminally bonded had enough land to support a family  Every male citizen had a voice in the town meeting  The town meeting levied taxes  built roads  and elected officials who managed town affairs  The towns did not have courts that was a function of a larger unit  the county  whose officials were appointed by the state government  53  The Congregational Church  the church the Puritans founded  was not automatically joined by all New England residents because of Puritan beliefs that God singled out only a few specific people for salvation  Instead  membership was limited to those who could convincingly  test  before members of the church that they had been saved  They were known as  the elect  or  Saints  and made up less than 40  of the population of New England  54   edit  Farm life A majority of New England residents were small farmers  Within these small farm families  and English families as well  a man had complete power over the property and his wife  When married  an English woman lost her maiden name and personal identity  meaning she could not own property  file lawsuits  or participate in political life  even when widowed  The role of wives was to raise and nurture healthy children and support their husbands  Most women carried out these duties  In the mid 18th century  women usually married in their early 20s and had 6 to 8 children  most of whom survived to adulthood  Farm women provided most of the materials needed by the rest of the family by spinning yarn from wool and knitting sweaters and stockings  making candles and soap from ashes  and churning milk into butter  55  long term economic growth Most New England parents tried to help their sons establish farms of their own  When sons married  fathers gave them gifts of land  livestock  or farming equipment  daughters received household goods  farm animals  and or cash  Arranged marriages were very unusual  normally  children chose their own spouses from within a circle of suitable acquaintances who shared their race  religion  and social standing  Parents retained veto power over their children s marriages  New England farming families generally lived in wooden houses because of the abundance of trees  A typical New England farmhouse was one and a half stories tall and had a strong frame  usually made of large square timbers  that was covered by wooden clapboard siding  A large chimney stood in the middle of the house that provided cooking facilities and warmth during the winter  One side of the ground floor contained a hall  a general purpose room where the family worked and ate meals  Adjacent to the hall was the parlor  a room used to entertain guests that contained the family s best furnishings and the parent s bed  Children slept in a loft above  while the kitchen was either part of the hall or was located in a shed along the back of the house  Because colonial families were large  these small dwellings had much activity and there was little privacy  By the middle of the 18th century  this way of life was facing a crisis as the region s population had nearly doubled each generation from 100 000 in 1700 to 200 000 in 1725  to 350 000 by 1750 because farm households had many children  and most people lived until they were 60 years old  As colonists in Massachusetts  Connecticut  and Rhode Island continued to subdivide their land between farmers  the farms became too small to support single families  This overpopulation threatened the New England ideal of a society of independent yeoman farmers  56  Some farmers obtained land grants to create farms in undeveloped land in Massachusetts and Connecticut or bought plots of land from speculators in New Hampshire and what later became Vermont  Other farmers became agricultural innovators  They planted nutritious English grass such as red clover and timothy grass  which provided more feed for livestock  and potatoes  which provided a high production rate that was an advantage for small farms  Families increased their productivity by exchanging goods and labor with each other  They loaned livestock and grazing land to one another and worked together to spin yarn  sew quilts  and shuck corn  Migration  agricultural innovation  and economic cooperation were creative measures that preserved New England s yeoman society until the 19th century   edit  Town life Saltbox style homes originated in New England after 1650 By the mid 18th century in New England  shipbuilding was a staple  The British crown often turned to the cheap  yet strongly built American ships  There was a shipyard at the mouth of almost every river in New England  By 1750  a variety of artisans  shopkeepers  and merchants provided services to the growing farming population  Blacksmiths  wheelwrights  and furniture makers set up shops in rural villages  There they built and repaired goods needed by farm families  Stores selling English manufactures such as cloth  iron utensils  and window glass as well as West Indian products like sugar and molasses were set up by traders  The storekeepers of these shops sold their imported goods in exchange for crops and other local products including roof shingles  potash  and barrel staves  These local goods were shipped to towns and cities all along the Atlantic Coast  Enterprising men set up stables and taverns along wagon roads to service this transportation system  After these products had been delivered to port towns such as Boston and Salem in Massachusetts  New Haven in Connecticut  and Newport and Providence in Rhode Island  merchants then exported them to the West Indies where they were traded for molasses  sugar  gold coins  and bills of exchange  credit slips   They carried the West Indian products to New England factories where the raw sugar was turned into granulated sugar and the molasses distilled into rum  The gold and credit slips were sent to England where they were exchanged for manufactures  which were shipped back to the colonies and sold along with the sugar and rum to farmers  Other New England merchants took advantage of the rich fishing areas along the Atlantic Coast and financed a large fishing fleet  transporting its catch of mackerel and cod to the West Indies and Europe  Some merchants exploited the vast amounts of timber along the coasts and rivers of northern New England  They funded sawmills that supplied cheap wood for houses and shipbuilding  Hundreds of New England shipwrights built oceangoing ships  which they sold to British and American merchants  Many merchants became very wealthy by providing their goods to the agricultural population and ended up dominating the society of sea port cities  Unlike yeoman farmhouses  these merchants resembled the lifestyle of that of the upper class of England living in elegant 2 1 2 story houses designed the new Georgian style  These Georgian houses had a symmetrical fa ade with equal numbers of windows on both sides of the central door  The interior consisted of a passageway down the middle of the house with specialized rooms such as a library  dining room  formal parlor  and master bedroom off the sides  Unlike the multi purpose space of the yeoman houses  each of these rooms served a separate purpose  In a Georgian house  men mainly used certain rooms  such as the library  while women mostly used the kitchen  These houses contained bedrooms on the second floor that provided privacy to parents and children   edit  Culture and education Main article  History of education in the United States Colonial Era Main article  Education in Colonial America Education was primarily the responsibility of families  but numerous religious groups  especially the Puritans in New England  established tax supported elementary schools so their children could read the Bible  Nearly all the religious denominations set up their own schools and colleges to train ministers  Each city  and most towns  had private academies for the children of affluent families  57  Massachusetts Hall  oldest surviving building at Harvard University  built 1718 1720 as a dormitory Elementary education was widespread in New England  Early Puritan settlers believed it was necessary to study the Bible  so children were taught to read at an early age  It was also required that each town pay for a primary school  About 10 percent enjoyed secondary schooling and funded grammar schools in larger towns  Most boys learned skills from their fathers on the farm or as apprentices to artisans  Few girls attended formal schools  but most were able to get some education at home or at so called  Dame schools  where women taught basic reading and writing skills in their own houses  By 1750  nearly 90  of New England s women and almost all of its men could read and write  Puritans founded Harvard College in 1636 and Yale College in 1701  Later  Baptists founded Rhode Island College  now Brown University  in 1764 and Congregationalists established Dartmouth College in 1769  Virginia founded schools the College of William and Mary in 1693  it was primarily Anglican  The colleges were designed for aspiring ministers  lawyers or doctors  There were no departments or majors  as every student shared the same curriculum  which focused on Latin and Greek  mathematics  and history  philosophy  logic  ethics  rhetoric  oratory  and a little basic science  There were no sports or fraternities and few extracurricular activities apart from literary societies  There were no separate seminaries  law schools  or divinity schools  The first medical schools were founded late in the colonial era in Philadelphia and New York  58  New Englanders wrote journals  pamphlets  books and especially sermons more than all of the other colonies combined  Cotton Mather  a Boston minister published Magnalia Christi Americana  The Great Works of Christ in America  1702   while revivalist Jonathan Edwards wrote his philosophical work  A Careful and Strict Enquiry Into   Notions of   Freedom of Will     1754   Most music had a religious theme as well and was mainly the singing of Psalms  Because of New England s deep religious beliefs  artistic works that were insufficiently religious or too  worldly  were banned  especially the theater  The leading theologian and philosopher of the colonial era was Jonathan Edwards of Massachusetts  an interpreter of Calvinism  and the leader of the First Great Awakening   edit  Religion Some migrants who came to Colonial America were in search of religious freedom  London did not make the Church of England official in the colonies it never sent a bishop so religious practice became diverse  59  The Great Awakening was a major religious revival movement that took place in most colonies in the 1730s and 1740s  60  The movement began with Jonathan Edwards  a Massachusetts preacher who sought to return to the Pilgrims  strict Calvinist roots and to reawaken the  Fear of God   English preacher George Whitefield and other itinerant preachers continued the movement  traveling across the colonies and preaching in a dramatic and emotional style  Followers of Edwards and other preachers of similar religiosity called themselves the  New Lights   as contrasted with the  Old Lights   who disapproved of their movement  To promote their viewpoints  the two sides established academies and colleges  including Princeton and Williams College  The Great Awakening has been called the first truly American event  61  A similar pietistic revival movement took place among some German and Dutch settlers  leading to more divisions  By the 1770s  the Baptists were growing rapidly both in the north  where they founded Brown University   and in the South  where they challenged the previously unquestioned moral authority of the Anglican establishment    edit  Mid Atlantic Region Unlike New England  the Mid Atlantic Region gained much of its population from new immigration  and by 1750  the combined populations of New York  New Jersey  and Pennsylvania had reached nearly 300 000 people  By 1750  about 60 000 Irish and 50 000 Germans came to live in British North America  many of them settling in the Mid Atlantic Region  William Penn  the man who founded the colony of Pennsylvania in 1682  attracted an influx of British Quakers with his policies of religious liberty and freehold ownership    Freehold  meant owning land free and clear  with the right to resell it to anyone   The first major influx of settlers were the Scotch Irish  who headed to the frontier  Many Germans came to escape the religious conflicts and declining economic opportunities in Germany and Switzerland   edit  Ways of life Much of the architecture of the Middle Colonies reflects the diversity of its peoples  In Albany and New York City  a majority of the buildings were Dutch style with brick exteriors and high gables at each end while many Dutch churches were shaped liked an octagon  Using cut stone to build their houses  German and Welsh settlers in Pennsylvania followed the way of their homeland and completely ignored the plethora of timber in the area  An example of this would be Germantown  Pennsylvania where 80 percent of the buildings in the town were made entirely of stone  On the other hand  settlers from Ireland took advantage of America s ample supply of timber and constructed sturdy log cabins  Ethnic cultures also affected the styles of furniture  Rural Quakers preferred simple designs in furnishings such as tables  chairs  chests and shunned elaborate decorations  However  some urban Quakers had much more elaborate furniture  The city of Philadelphia became a major center of furniture making because of its massive wealth from Quaker and British merchants  Philadelphian cabinet makers built elegant desks and highboys  German artisans created intricate carved designs on their chests and other furniture with painted scenes of flowers and birds  German potters also crafted a large array of jugs  pots  and plates  of both elegant and traditional design  There were ethnic differences in the treatment of women  Among Puritan settlers in New England  wives almost never worked in the fields with their husbands  In German communities in Pennsylvania  however  many women worked in fields and stables  German and Dutch immigrants granted women more control over property  which was not permitted in the local English law  Unlike English colonial wives  German and Dutch wives owned their own clothes and other items and were also given the ability to write wills disposing of the property brought into the marriage  By the time of the Revolutionary War  approximately 85 percent of white Americans were of English  Irish  Welsh  or Scottish descent  Approximately 8 8 percent of whites were of German ancestry  and 3 5 percent were of Dutch origin   edit  Farming Ethnicity made a difference in agricultural practice  As an example  German farmers generally preferred oxen rather than horses to pull their plows and Scots Irish made a farming economy based on hogs and corn  In Ireland  people farmed intensively  working small pieces of land trying to get the largest possible production rate from their crops  In the American colonies  settlers from northern Ireland focused on mixed farming  Using this technique  they grew corn for human consumption and as feed for hogs and other livestock  Many improvement minded farmers of all different backgrounds began using new agricultural practices to raise their output  During the 1750s  these agricultural innovators replaced the hand sickles and scythes used to harvest hay  wheat  and barley with the cradle scythe  a tool with wooden fingers that arranged the stalks of grain for easy collection  This tool was able to triple the amount of work done by farmers in one day  Farmers also began fertilizing their fields with dung and lime and rotating their crops to keep the soil fertile  Before 1720  most colonists in the mid Atlantic region worked with small scale farming and paid for imported manufactures by supplying the West Indies with corn and flour  In New York  a fur pelt export trade to Europe flourished adding additional wealth to the region  After 1720  mid Atlantic farming stimulated with the international demand for wheat  A massive population explosion in Europe brought wheat prices up  By 1770  a bushel of wheat cost twice as much as it did in 1720  Farmers also expanded their production of flax seed and corn since flax was a high demand in the Irish linen industry and a demand for corn existed in the West Indies  Some immigrants who just arrived purchased farms and shared in this export wealth  but many poor German and Irish immigrants were forced to work as agricultural wage laborers  Merchants and artisans also hired these homeless workers for a domestic system for the manufacture of cloth and other goods  Merchants often bought wool and flax from farmers and employed newly arrived immigrants  who had been textile workers in Ireland and Germany  to work in their homes spinning the materials into yarn and cloth  Large farmers and merchants became wealthy  while farmers with smaller farms and artisans only made enough for subsistence  The Mid Atlantic region  by 1750  was divided by both ethnic background and wealth   edit  Seaports Seaports  which expanded from wheat trade  had more social classes than anywhere else in the Middle Colonies  By 1750  the population of Philadelphia had reached 25 000  New York 15 000  and the port of Baltimore 7 000  Merchants dominated seaport society and about 40 merchants controlled half of Philadelphia s trade  Wealthy merchants in Philadelphia and New York  like their counterparts in New England  built elegant Georgian style mansions  Shopkeepers  artisans  shipwrights  butchers  coopers  seamstresses  cobblers  bakers  carpenters  masons  and many other specialized professions  made up the middle class of seaport society  Wives and husbands often worked as a team and taught their children their crafts to pass it on through the family  Many of these artisans and traders made enough money to create a modest life  Laborers stood at the bottom of seaport society  These poor people worked on the docks unloading inbound vessels and loading outbound vessels with wheat  corn  and flaxseed  Many of these were African American  some were free while others were enslaved  In 1750  blacks made up about 10 percent of the population of New York and Philadelphia  Hundreds of seamen  some who were African American  worked as sailors on merchant ships   edit  Southern Colonies The Southern Colonies were mainly dominated by the wealthy planters in Maryland  Virginia  and South Carolina  They owned increasingly large plantations that were worked by African slaves  Of the 650 000 inhabitants of the South in 1750  about 250 000 or 40 percent  were slaves  The plantations grew tobacco  indigo and rice for export  and raised most of their own food supplies  62  In addition  many small subsistence farms were family owned and operated by yeoman  Most white men owned some land  and therefore could vote  63   edit  Women in the South Since the social history revolution in the 1970s historians have paid special attention to the role of women  family and gender in the colonial South  64  65  66  In the early Chesapeake colonies  very few women were present  Much of the population consisted of young  single  white indentured servants  and as such the colonies  to a large degree  lacked any social cohesiveness  African women entered the colony as early as 1619  although their status  free  slave or indentured servant remains a historical debate  In the 17th century high mortality rates for newcomers and a very high ratio of men to women made family life either impossible or unstable for most colonists  These factors  along with dispersed settlements and a reluctance to live in villages  together with a growing immigration of white indentured servants and black slaves made families and communities in the Virginia Maryland region before 1700 fundamentally different from their counterparts in Europe and New England  These extreme conditions both demeaned and empowered women  Lacking male protectors  women  especially teenage girls who were indentured servants  often were vulnerable to exploitation and abuse  On the other hand  without parental oversight  young women had much more freedom in choosing spouses  and the shortage of eligible women enabled them to use marriage as an avenue to upward mobility  The high death rates meant that Chesapeake wives generally became widows who inherited property  many widows increased their property by remarrying as soon as possible  As the population began to stabilize around 1700  women married younger  remained wed longer  bore more children  and lost influence within the family polity  67   edit  Slaves Main article  Slavery in Colonial America the enslaved African  known as African slaves  although they were not considered slaves until they were officially purchased by a planter or plantation owner  who worked on the indigo  tobacco  and rice fields in the South came from mainly western and central Africa  Slavery in Colonial America was very oppressive as it passed on from generation to generation  and slaves had no legal rights  The colonies that had the most specialization in production of goods  such as sugar and coffee  relied most on slaves and consequentially  had the highest per capita  including slaves  income in the New World  However  the slaves did not accrue wages or receive rights and provided free labor to those who purchased them and received just enough to live  They were considered in Chattel slavery  Between 1500 and 1700  over 60  of the 6 million people who were brought or traveled to the New World were involuntary slaves  In 1700  there were about 9 600 slaves in the Chesapeake region and a few hundred in the Carolinas  About 170 000 more Africans were forcibly brought over the next five decades  By 1750  there were more than 250 000 slaves in British America  and  in the Carolinas  they made up about 60 percent of the total population  The first post colonial Census found 697 681 slaves and 59 527 free blacks  who together made up about 20  of the country s population  Most slaves in South Carolina were born in Africa  while half the slaves in Virginia and Maryland were born in the colonies  citation needed
