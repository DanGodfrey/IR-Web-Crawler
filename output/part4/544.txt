2001  37  as the armed forces of the United States of America  the United Kingdom  the Commonwealth of Australia  and the Afghan United Front  Northern Alliance  launched Operation Enduring Freedom  The primary driver of the invasion was the September 11 attacks on the United States  with the stated goal of dismantling the al Qaeda terrorist organization and ending its use of Afghanistan as a base  The United States also said that it would remove the Taliban regime from power and create a viable democratic state  A decade into the war  the U S  continues to battle a widespread Taliban insurgency  and the war has expanded into the tribal areas of neighboring Pakistan  38  The preludes to the war were the assassination of anti Taliban leader Ahmad Shah Massoud on September 9  2001  and the September 11 attacks on the United States  in which nearly 3000 civilians lost their lives in New York City  Arlington  Virginia  and Shanksville  Pennsylvania  The United States identified members of al Qaeda  an organization based in  operating out of and allied with the Taliban s Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan  as the perpetrators of the attacks  In the first phase of Operation Enduring Freedom  ground forces of the Afghan United Front working with U S  and British Special Forces and with massive U S  air support  ousted the Taliban regime from power in Kabul and most of Afghanistan in a matter of weeks  Most of the senior Taliban leadership fled to neighboring Pakistan  The democratic Islamic Republic of Afghanistan was established and an interim government under Hamid Karzai was created which was also democratically elected by the Afghan people in the 2004 general elections  The International Security Assistance Force  ISAF  was established by the UN Security Council at the end of December 2001 to secure Kabul and the surrounding areas  NATO assumed control of ISAF in 2003  ISAF includes troops from 42 countries  with NATO members providing the core of the force  39  The stated aim of the invasion was to find Osama bin Laden and other high ranking al Qaeda members to be put on trial  to destroy the organization of al Qaeda  and to remove the Taliban regime which supported and gave safe harbor to it  The George W  Bush administration stated that  as policy  it would not distinguish between terrorist organizations and nations or governments that harbored them  In 2003  Taliban forces including the Haqqani network and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar s Hezb i Islami started an insurgency campaign against the democratic Islamic Republic and the presence of ISAF troops in Afghanistan  40  41  Their headquarters are alleged to be in or near Quetta  Pakistan  42  Since 2006  Afghanistan has experienced a dramatic increase in Taliban led insurgent activity  In their campaign the Taliban also target the civilian population of Afghanistan in terrorist attacks  According to a report by the United Nations  the Taliban were responsible for 76  of civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2009  43  The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission  AIGRC  called the Taliban s terrorism against the Afghan civilian population a war crime  44  Religious leaders condemned Taliban terrorist attacks and said these kinds of attacks are against Islamic ethics  44  On December 1  2009  U S  President Barack Obama announced that he would deploy an additional 30 000 soldiers over a period of six months  45  He also set a withdrawal date for the year 2014  The New York Magazine writes that Gen  Stanley McChrystal s leaking of the need for additional troops boxed Obama into a corner about boosting troop levels in Afghanistan  which the magazine refers to as the  McChrystal risk   leaking of information to force presidential action   46  On January 26  2010  at the International Conference on Afghanistan in London  which brought together some 70 countries and organizations  47 Afghan President Hamid Karzai told world leaders that he intended to reach out to the top echelons of the Taliban  including Mullah Omar  Siraj Haqqani and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar  with a peace initiative  48  He called on the group s leadership to take part in a  loya jirga    or large assembly of elders   to initiate peace talks  49  According to the Wall Street Journal  these steps have been reciprocated so far with an intensification of bombings  assassinations and ambushes  50  Many Afghan groups  including the former intelligence chief Amrullah Saleh and opposition leader Dr  Abdullah Abdullah  believe that Karzai s plan aims to appease the insurgents  senior leadership at the cost of the democratic constitution  the democratic process and progress in the field of human rights  especially women s rights  51  On June 22  2011  President Obama announced that 10 000 U S  troops would be withdrawn by the end of 2011  An additional 23 000 troops will leave the country by the summer of 2012  After the withdrawal of 10 000 U S  troops  80 000 are left participating in the war  52  The War in Afghanistan is the United States s second longest military conflict  only the Vietnam War  1959 1975  lasted longer  Contents 1 Historical

war in Afghanistan  1992 1996   and CIA activities in Afghanistan After the fall of the Najibullah regime in 1992  the Afghan political parties agreed on a peace and power sharing agreement  the Peshawar Accords   The Peshawar Accords created the Islamic State of Afghanistan and appointed an interim government for a transitional period  According to Human Rights Watch  The sovereignty of Afghanistan was vested formally in the Islamic State of Afghanistan  an entity created in April 1992  after the fall of the Soviet backed Najibullah government      With the exception of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar s Hezb e Islami  all of the parties     were ostensibly unified under this government in April 1992      Hekmatyar s Hezb e Islami  for its part  refused to recognize the government for most of the period discussed in this report and launched attacks against government forces and Kabul generally      Shells and rockets fell everywhere  53   Human Rights Watch  2005 Gulbuddin Hekmatyar received operational  financial and military support from Pakistan  54  Afghanistan expert Amin Saikal concludes in Modern Afghanistan  A History of Struggle and Survival  Pakistan was keen to gear up for a breakthrough in Central Asia      Islamabad could not possibly expect the new Islamic government leaders     to subordinate their own nationalist objectives in order to help Pakistan realize its regional ambitions      Had it not been for the ISI s logistic support and supply of a large number of rockets  Hekmatyar s forces would not have been able to target and destroy half of Kabul  55   Amin Saikal in Modern Afghanistan  A History of Struggle and Survival  2004 In addition  Saudi Arabia and Iran   as competitors for regional hegemony   supported Afghan militias hostile towards each other  55  According to Human Rights Watch  Iran was assisting the Shia Hazara Hezb i Wahdat forces of Abdul Ali Mazari  as Iran was attempting to maximize Wahdat s military power and influence  53  55  56  Saudi Arabia supported the Wahhabite Abdul Rasul Sayyaf and his Ittihad i Islami faction  53  55  Conflict between the two militias soon escalated into a full scale war  A publication by the George Washington University describes   O utside forces saw instability in Afghanistan as an opportunity to press their own security and political agendas  57    The Taliban File  by the George Washington University  2003 Due to the sudden initiation of the war  working government departments  police units or a system of justice and accountability for the newly created Islamic State of Afghanistan did not have time to form  The United States and European countries after the communist defeat largely lost interest in Afghanistan and disengaged  U S  congressman Dana Rohrabacher told U S  Congress in 2004   I t was a policy decision to walk away    even after psychopathic killers like Gulbuddin Hekmatyar rose up as the Soviets departed     The Saudis and the Pakistanis supported the arming of these violent extremists  Predictably  what followed was a period of havoc and bloodshed  58   U S  Congressman Dana Rohrabacher  2004 Atrocities were committed by individuals of the different armed factions while Kabul descended into lawlessness and chaos as described in reports by Human Rights Watch and the Afghanistan Justice Project  53  59  Because of the chaos  some leaders increasingly had only nominal control over their  sub  commanders  60  For civilians there was little security from murder  rape and extortion  60  Approxim  edit  Legal basis for war The United Nations Charter  to which all the Coalition countries are signatories  provides that all UN member states must settle their international disputes peacefully and no member nation can use military force except in self defense  The United States Constitution states that international treaties  such as the United Nations Charter  that are ratified by the U S  are part of the law of the land in the U S   though subject to effective repeal by any subsequent act of Congress  i e   the  leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant  or  last in time  canon of statutory interpretation   61  The United Nations Security Council  UNSC  did not authorize the U S  led military campaign in Afghanistan  Operation Enduring Freedom   Defenders of the legitimacy of the U S  led invasion argue that U N  Security Council authorization was not required since the invasion was an act of collective self defense provided for under Article 51 of the UN Charter  and therefore was not a war of aggression  61  62  Critics maintain that the bombing and invasion of Afghanistan were not legitimate self defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter because the 9 11 attacks were not  armed attacks  by another state  but rather were perpetrated by groups of individuals or non state actors  and that these attackers had no proven connection to Afghanistan  Further  it is their opinion that even if a state had perpetrated the 9 11 attacks  no bombing campaign would constitute self defense  the necessity for self defense must be  instant  overwhelming  leaving no choice of means  and no moment for deliberation    63  President George W  Bush was authorized by Congress on September 14  2001  by legislation titled Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists which was passed and signed on September 18  2001  by both President Bush and congress  This legislation authorized the use of United States Armed Forces against those responsible for the attacks on September 11  2001  The authorization granted the President the authority to use all  necessary and appropriate force  against those whom he determined  planned  authorized  committed or aided  the September 11 attacks  or who harbored said persons or groups  The Bush administration  for its part  did not seek a declaration of war by the U S  Senate  and labeled Taliban troops as supporters of terrorists rather than soldiers  denying them the protections of the Geneva Convention and due process of law  This position was successfully challenged in the U S  Supreme Court 64  and questioned even by military lawyers responsible for prosecuting affected prisoners  65  On December 20  2001  more than two months after the U S  led attack began  the UNSC authorized the creation of an International Security Assistance Force  ISAF  to take all measures necessary to fulfill its mandate of assisting the Afghan Interim Authority in maintaining security  66  Command of the ISAF passed to NATO on August 11  2003  67   edit  2001  Initial attack Further information  2001 in Afghanistan On September 20  2001  U S  president George W  Bush addressed the United States Congress and demanded that the Taliban deliver Osama bin Laden and destroy bases of al Qaeda  68   On October 5  2001  the Taliban offered to try Bin Laden in an Afghan court  so long as the United States provided what it called  solid evidence  of his guilt  but the U S  would not hand over its evidence to the Taliban  5   So on October 7  2001  the U S  government launched military operations in Afghanistan  Teams from the CIA s Special Activities Division  SAD  were the first U S  forces to enter Afghanistan and begin combat operations  They were soon joined by U S  Army Special Forces from the 5th Special Forces Group and other units from USSOCOM  69  70  71  On October 7  2001  airstrikes were reported in the capital  Kabul  where electricity supplies were severed   at the airport  at Kandahar  home of the Taliban s Supreme Leader Mullah Omar   and in the city of Jalalabad  CNN released exclusive footage of Kabul being bombed to all the American broadcasters at approximately 5 08 pm October 7  2001  72  US Special Forces with Northern Alliance troops on horseback At 17 00 UTC  President Bush confirmed the strikes on national television and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair also addressed the UK  Bush stated that Taliban military sites and terrorist training grounds would be targeted  In addition  food  medicine  and supplies would be dropped to  the starving and suffering men  women and children of Afghanistan   73  US officials rejected a new offer from the Taliban to hand over Osama bin Laden to a third country for trial if the Americans halted the bombing of Afghanistan  74  A prerecorded videotape of Osama bin Laden had been released before the attacks in which he condemned any attacks against Afghanistan  Al Jazeera  the Arabic satellite news channel  reported that these tapes were received shortly before the attack  British and American special forces worked jointly to liberate Herat in November 2001  These forces worked with Afghan opposition groups on the ground  in particular the Northern Alliance  The United Kingdom  Canada and Australia also deployed forces and several other countries provided basing  access and overflight permission  The U S  was able to track al Qaeda s number three at the time Mohammed Atef who was one of the most wanted  when Atef was killed  along with his guard Abu Ali al Yafi i and six others  75  76  in a U S  air strike on his home near Kabul during the U S  invasion of Afghanistan at some time between November 14 16  2001  This was one of America s first and largest victories during the early stages of the war   edit  Air campaigns Bombers operating at high altitudes well out of range of antiaircraft guns dropped bombs at Afghan training camps and Taliban air defenses  U S  aircraft  including Apache helicopter gunships from the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade  operated with impunity throughout the campaign with no losses due to Taliban air defenses  The strikes initially focused on the area in and around the cities of Kabul  Jalalabad  and Kandahar  Within a few days  most Taliban training sites were severely damaged and the Taliban s air defenses were destroyed  The campaign then focused on command  control  and communication targets which weakened the ability of the Taliban forces to communicate  However  the line facing the Afghan Northern Alliance held  and no tangible battlefield successes had yet occurred on that front  Two weeks into the campaign  the Northern Alliance demanded the air campaign focus more on the front lines  Example of the U S  propaganda pamphlets dropped over Mazari Sharif  The next stage of the campaign began with carrier based F A 18 Hornet fighter bombers hitting Taliban vehicles in pinpoint strikes  while other U S  planes began cluster bombing Taliban defenses  For the first time in years  Northern Alliance commanders finally began to see the substantive results that they had long hoped for on the front lines  At the beginning of November  the Taliban front lines were bombed with daisy cutter bombs  and by AC 130 gunships  The Taliban fighters had no previous experience with American firepower  and often even stood on top of bare ridgelines where Special Forces could easily spot them and call in close air support  By November 2  Taliban frontal positions were devastated  and a Northern Alliance march on Kabul seemed possible for the first time  Foreign fighters from al Qaeda took over security in the Afghan cities  demonstrating the instability of the Taliban regime  Meanwhile  the Northern Alliance and their Central Intelligence Agency Special Forces advisors planned the next stage of their offensive  Northern Alliance troops would seize Mazari Sharif  thereby cutting off Taliban supply lines and enabling the flow of equipment from the countries to the north  followed by an attack on Kabul itself  Areas most targeted During the early months of the war the U S  military had a limited presence on the ground  The plan was that Special Forces  and intelligence officers with a military background  would serve as liaisons with Afghan militias opposed to the Taliban  would advance after the cohesiveness of the Taliban forces was disrupted by American air power  77  78  79  The Tora Bora Mountains lie roughly east of Afghanistan s capital Kabul  which is itself close to the border with Pakistan  American intelligence analysts believed that the Taliban and al Qaeda had dug in behind fortified networks of well supplied caves and underground bunkers  The area was subjected to a heavy continuous bombardment by B 52 bombers  77  78  79  80  The U S  forces and the Northern Alliance also began to diverge in their objectives  While the U S  was continuing the search for Osama bin Laden  the Northern Alliance was pressuring for more support in their efforts to finish off the Taliban and control the country   edit  Battle of Mazar i Sharif Further information  Fall of Mazar i Sharif US Army Special Forces on November 10  upon arriving into the city with Northern Alliance fighters The battle for Mazari Sharif was considered important  not only because it is the home of the Shrine of Hazrat Ali or  Blue Mosque   a sacred Muslim site  but also because it is the location of a significant transportation hub with two main airports and a major supply route leading into Uzbekistan  81  It would also enable humanitarian aid to alleviate Afghanistan s looming food crisis  which had threatened more than six million people with starvation  Many of those in most urgent need lived in rural areas to the south and west of Mazar i Sharif  81  82  On November 9  2001  Northern Alliance forces  under the command of generals Abdul Rashid Dostum and Ustad Atta Mohammed Noor  swept across the Pul i Imam Bukhri bridge  meeting some resistance  83  84  and seized the city s main military base and airport  U S  Special Operations Forces  namely Special Forces Operational Detachment A 595  CIA paramilitary officers and Air Force Combat Control Teams  85  86  87  on horseback and using Close Air Support platforms  took part in the push into the city of Mazari Sharif in Balkh Province by the Northern Alliance  After a bloody 90 minute battle  Taliban forces  who had held the city since 1998  withdrew from the city  triggering jubilant celebrations among the townspeople whose ethnic and political affinities are with the Northern Alliance  82  88  The Taliban had spent three years fighting the Northern Alliance for Mazar i Sharif  precisely because its capture would confirm them as masters of all Afghanistan  88  The fall of the city was a  body blow  88  to the Taliban and ultimately proved to be a  major shock   86  since the United States Central Command  CENTCOM  had originally believed that the city would remain in Taliban hands well into the following year  89  and any potential battle would be  a very slow advance   90  Following rumors that Mullah Dadullah was headed to recapture the city with as many as 8 000 Taliban fighters  a thousand American 10th Mountain Soldiers were airlifted into the city  which provided the first solid foothold from which Kabul and Kandahar could be reached  91  92  While prior military flights had to be launched from Uzbekistan or Aircraft carriers in the Arabian Sea  now the Americans held their own airport in the country which allowed them to fly more frequent sorties for resupply missions and humanitarian aid  These missions allowed massive shipments of humanitarian aid to be immediately shipped to hundreds of thousands of Afghans facing starvation on the northern plain  88  93  It was revealed that the airfield had been boobytrapped by the Taliban as they left  with explosives planted around the property  as well as being badly damaged by their own Air Interdiction missions to prevent it being used by the enemy  83  The destroyed runways on the airfield were patched by the U S  Air Force Red Horse personnel and local Afghans hired to fill bomb craters with asphalt and tar by hand  and the first cargo plane was able to land ten days after the battle  83  The airbase wasn t declared operational until December 11  94  The American backed forces now controlling the city began immediately broadcasting from Radio Mazar i Sharif  the former Taliban Voice of Sharia channel on 1584 kHz  95  including an address from former President Burhanuddin Rabbani  96  Music was also broadcast over Kabul radio for the first time in five years  and the songs were introduced by a female announcer   another major breakthrough for a city where women had been banned from education  work  and many other civil liberties since 1996  97   edit  Fall of Kabul On the night of November 12  Taliban forces fled from the city of Kabul  leaving under the cover of darkness  By the time Northern Alliance forces arrived in the afternoon of November 13  only bomb craters  burned foliage  and the burnt out shells of Taliban gun emplacements and positions were there to greet them  A group of about twenty hardline fighters hiding in the city s park were the only remaining defenders  This Taliban group was killed in a 15 minute gun battle  being heavily outnumbered and having had little more than a telescope to shield them  After these forces were neutralized Kabul was in the hands of the U S  NATO forces and the Northern Alliance  98  The fall of Kabul marked the beginning of a collapse of Taliban positions across the map  Within 24 hours  all the Afghan provinces along the Iranian border  including the key city of Herat  had fallen  Local Pashtun commanders and warlords had taken over throughout northeastern Afghanistan  including the key city of Jalalabad  Taliban holdouts in the north  mainly Pakistani volunteers  fell back to the northern city of Kunduz to make a stand  By November 16  the Taliban s last stronghold in northern Afghanistan was besieged by the Northern Alliance  Nearly 10 000 Taliban fighters  led by foreign fighters  refused to surrender and continued to put up resistance  By then  the Taliban had been forced back to their heartland in southeastern Afghanistan around Kandahar  99  By November 13  al Qaeda and Taliban forces  with the possible inclusion of Osama bin Laden  had regrouped and were concentrating their forces in the Tora Bora cave complex  on the Pakistan border 50 kilometers  30 mi  southwest of Jalalabad  to prepare for a stand against the Northern Alliance and U S  NATO forces  Nearly 2 000 al Qaeda and Taliban fighters fortified themselves in positions within bunkers and caves  and by November 16  U S  bombers began bombing the mountain fortress  Around the same time  CIA and Special Forces operatives were already at work in the area  enlisting and paying local warlords to join the fight and planning an attack on the Tora Bora complex  100   edit  Fall of Kunduz Just as the bombardment at Tora Bora was stepped up  the siege of Kunduz that began on November 16 was continuing  Finally  after nine days of heavy fighting and American aerial bombardment  Taliban fighters surrendered to Northern Alliance forces on November 25   November 26  Shortly before the surrender  Pakistani aircraft arrived ostensibly to evacuate a few hundred intelligence and military personnel who had been in Afghanistan before the U S  invasion to aid the Taliban s ongoing fight against the Northern Alliance  However  during this airlift  it is alleged that up to five thousand people were evacuated from the region  including

25  the day that Taliban fighters holding out in Kunduz surrendered and were being herded into the Qala I Janghi fortress near Mazar I Sharif  a few Taliban attacked some Northern Alliance guards  taking their weapons and opening fire  This incident soon triggered a widespread revolt by 300 prisoners  who soon seized the southern half of the complex  once a medieval fortress  including an armory stocked with small arms and crew served weapons  One American CIA paramilitary operative who had been interrogating prisoners  Johnny Micheal Spann  was killed  marking the first American combat death in the war  The revolt was finally put down after seven days of heavy fighting between an SBS unit along with some U S  Army Special Forces and Northern Alliance  AC 130 gunships and other aircraft took part providing strafing fire on several occasions  as well as a bombing airstrikes  104  A total of 86 of the Taliban prisoners survived  and around 50 Northern Alliance soldiers were killed  The squashing of the revolt marked the end of the combat in northern Afghanistan  where local Northern Alliance warlords were now firmly in control   edit  Consolidation  the taking of Kandahar Army Special Forces with Hamid Karzai in Kandahar province By the end of November  Kandahar  the Taliban s birthplace  was its last remaining stronghold  and was coming under increasing pressure  Nearly 3 000 tribal fighters  led by Hamid Karzai  a loyalist of the former Afghan king  and Gul Agha Sherzai  the governor of Kandahar before the Taliban seized power  pressured Taliban forces from the east and cut off the northern Taliban supply lines to Kandahar  The threat of the Northern Alliance loomed in the north and northeast  Meanwhile  nearly 1 000 Marines  ferried in by CH 53E Super Stallion helicopters and C 130s  set up a Forward Operating Base known as Camp Rhino in the desert south of Kandahar on November 25  This was the coalition s first strategic foothold in Afghanistan  and was the stepping stone to establishing other operating bases  The first significant combat involving U S  ground forces occurred a day after Rhino was captured when 15 armored vehicles approached the base and were attacked by helicopter gunships  destroying many of them  Meanwhile  the airstrikes continued to pound Taliban positions inside the city  where Mullah Omar was holed up  Omar  the Taliban leader  remained defiant although his movement only controlled 4 out of the 30 Afghan provinces by the end of November and called on his forces to fight to the death  On December 6  the U S  government rejected any amnesty for Omar or any Taliban leaders  Shortly thereafter on December 7  Omar slipped out of the city of Kandahar with a group of his hardcore loyalists and moved northwest into the mountains of Uruzgan Province  reneging on the Taliban s promise to surrender their fighters and their weapons  He was last reported seen driving off with a group of his fighters on a convoy of motorcycles  Other members of the Taliban leadership fled into Pakistan through the remote passes of Paktia and Paktika Provinces  Nevertheless  Kandahar  the last Taliban controlled city  had fallen  and the majority of the Taliban fighters had disbanded  The border town of Spin Boldak was surrendered on the same day  marking the end of Taliban control in Afghanistan  The Afghan tribal forces under Gul Agha seized the city of Kandahar while the Marines took control of the airport outside and established a U S  base   edit  Battle of Tora Bora Main article  Battle

steadily pushed bin Laden back across the difficult terrain  backed by Delta Force  UK Special Forces and withering air strikes by the U S  Facing defeat  the al Qaeda forces agreed to a truce to give them time to surrender their weapons  In retrospect  however  many believe that the truce was a ruse to allow important al Qaeda figures  including Osama bin Laden  to escape  On December 12  the fighting flared again  probably initiated by a rear guard buying time for the main force s escape through the White Mountains into the tribal areas of Pakistan  Again  tribal forces backed by British and U S  special operations troops and air support pressed ahead against fortified al Qaeda positions in caves and bunkers scattered throughout the mountainous region  By December 17  the last cave complex had been taken and their defenders overrun  A search of the area by U S  and UK forces continued into January  but no sign of bin Laden or the al Qaeda leadership emerged  It is almost unanimously believed that they had already slipped away into the tribal areas of Pakistan to the south and east  It is estimated that around 200 of the al Qaeda fighters were killed during the battle  along with an unknown number of anti Taliban tribal fighters  No U S  or UK deaths were reported   edit  Diplomatic and humanitarian efforts After the Taliban fled Kabul in November 2001 and left their stronghold  the southern city of Kandahar  in December 2001  it was generally understood that by then major al Qaeda and Taliban leaders had fled across the border into Pakistan  To fill the political void  in December 2001 the United Nations hosted the Bonn Conference in Germany  The meetings of various Afghan leaders here were organized by the United Nations Security Council  The Taliban were not included  Participants included representatives of four Afghan opposition groups  Observers included representatives of neighbouring and other involved major countries  including the United States  The result was the Bonn Agreement which created the Afghan Interim Authority that would serve as the  repository of Afghan sovereignty  and outlined the so called Petersberg Process  a political process towards a new constitution and choosing a new Afghan government  United Nations Security Council Resolution 1378 of November 14  2001  included  Condemning the Taliban for allowing Afghanistan to be used as a base for the export of terrorism by the al Qaeda network and other terrorist groups and for providing safe haven to Osama bin Laden  al Qaeda and others associated with them  and in this context supporting the efforts of the Afghan people to replace the Taliban regime   105  To help provide security to support this Afghan Interim Authority  the United Nations authorized an international force   the International Security Assistance Force  ISAF    with a mandate to help the Afghans maintain security in Kabul and surrounding areas  Before the U S  led

and al Qaeda had not given up  Al Qaeda forces began regrouping in the Shahi Kot mountains of Paktia province throughout January and February 2002  A Taliban fugitive in Paktia province  Mullah Saifur Rehman  also began reconstituting some of his militia forces in support of the anti U S  fighters  They totalled over 1 000 by the beginning of March 2002  The intention of the insurgents was to use the region as a base area for launching guerrilla attacks and possibly a major offensive in the style of the Mujahideen who battled Soviet forces during the 1980s  U S  allied to Afghan militia intelligence sources soon picked up on this buildup in Paktia province and prepared a massive push to counter it  On March 2  2002  U S  and Afghan forces launched an offensive on al Qaeda and Taliban forces entrenched in the mountains of Shahi Kot southeast of Gardez  The Mujahideen forces  who used small arms  rocket propelled grenades  and mortars  were entrenched into caves and bunkers in the hillsides at an altitude that was largely above 10 000 feet  3 000 m   They used  hit and run  tactics  opening fire on the U S  and Afghan forces and then retreating back into their caves and bunkers to weather the return fire and persistent U S  bombing raids  To compound the situation for the coalition troops  U S  commanders initially underestimated the Taliban and al Qaeda forces as a last isolated pocket numbering fewer than 200  It turned out that the guerrillas numbered between 1 000 5 000 according to some estimates and that they were receiving reinforcements  110  By March 6  eight Americans and seven Afghan soldiers had been killed and reportedly 400 opposing forces had also been killed in the fighting  The coalition casualties stemmed from a friendly fire incident that killed one soldier  the downing of two helicopters by rocket propelled grenades and small arms fire that killed seven soldiers  and the pinning down of U S  forces being inserted into what was coined as  Objective Ginger  that resulted in dozens of wounded  111  However  several hundred guerrillas escaped the dragnet heading to the Waziristan tribal areas across the border in Pakistan  During Operation Anaconda and other missions during 2002 and 2003  special forces from several western nations were also involved in operations  These included the Australian Special Air Service Regiment  the Canadian Joint Task Force 2  the German KSK  the New Zealand Special Air Service and Norwegian Marinejegerkommandoen   edit  Post Anaconda operations Following the battle at Shahi Kot  it is believed that the al Qaeda fighters established sanctuaries among tribal protectors in Pakistan  from which they regained their strength and later began launching cross border raids on U S  forces by the summer months of 2002  Guerrilla units  numbering between 5 and 25 men  still regularly crossed the border from their sanctuaries in Pakistan to fire rockets at U S  bases and ambush American convoys and patrols  as well as Afghan National Army troops  Afghan militia forces working with the U S led coalition  and non governmental organizations  The area around the U S  base at Shkin in Paktika province saw some of the heaviest activity  Meanwhile  Taliban forces remained in hiding in the rural regions of the four southern provinces that formed their heartland  Kandahar  Zabul  Helmand Province  and Uruzgan  In the wake of Operation Anaconda The Pentagon requested that British Royal Marines who are highly trained in mountain warfare  be deployed  They conducted a number of missions over several weeks with varying results  The Taliban  who during the summer of 2002 numbered in the hundreds  avoided combat with U S  forces and their Afghan allies and melted away into the

2004 in Afghanistan  and 2005 in Afghanistan After managing to evade U S  forces throughout mid 2002  the remnants of the Taliban gradually began to regain their confidence and started to begin preparations to launch the insurgency that Mullah Muhammad Omar had promised during the Taliban s last days in power  113  During September  Taliban forces began a recruitment drive in Pashtun areas in both Afghanistan and Pakistan to launch a renewed  jihad  or holy war against the Afghan government and the U S led coalition  Pamphlets distributed in secret during the night also began to appear in many villages in the former Taliban heartland in southeastern Afghanistan that called for jihad  114  Small mobile training camps were established along the border with Pakistan by al Qaeda and Taliban fugitives to train recruits in guerrilla warfare and terrorist tactics  according to Afghan sources and a United Nations report  115  Most of the recruits were drawn from the madrassas or religious schools of the tribal areas of Pakistan  from which the Taliban had originally arisen  Major bases  a few with as many as 200 men  were created in the mountainous tribal areas of Pakistan by the summer of 2003  The will of the Pakistani paramilitaries stationed at border crossings to prevent such infiltration was called into question  and Pakistani military operations proved of little use  116  The Taliban gradually reorganized and reconstituted their forces over the winter  preparing for a summer offensive  They established a new mode of operation  gathered into groups of around 50 to launch attacks on isolated outposts and convoys of Afghan soldiers  police  or militia and then breaking up into groups of 5 10 men to evade subsequent offensives  U S  forces in the strategy were attacked indirectly  through rocket attacks on bases and improvised explosive devices  To coordinate the strategy  Omar named a 10 man leadership council for the resistance  with himself at the head  116  Five operational zones were created  assigned to various Taliban commanders such as the key Taliban leader Mullah Dadullah  in charge of Zabul province operations  116  Al Qaeda forces in the east had a bolder strategy of concentrating on the Americans and catching them when they could with elaborate ambushes  The first sign that Taliban forces were regrouping came on January 27  2003  during Operation Mongoose  when a band of fighters allied with the Taliban and Hezb i Islami were discovered and assaulted by U S  forces at the Adi Ghar cave complex 15 miles  24 km  north of Spin Boldak  117  18 rebels were reported killed and no U S  casualties reported  The site was suspected to be a base to funnel supplies and fighters from Pakistan  The first isolated attacks by relatively large Taliban bands on Afghan targets also appeared around that time  US Marines searching for Taliban fighters in the spring of 2005 As the summer continued  the attacks gradually increased in frequency in the  Taliban heartland   Dozens of Afghan government soldiers  non governmental organization and humanitarian workers  and several U S  soldiers died in the raids  ambushes  and rocket attacks  Besides using guerrilla attacks  Taliban fighters began building up their forces in the district of Dai Chopan  a district in Zabul Province that also straddles Kandahar and Uruzgan and is at the very center of the Taliban heartland  Dai Chopan district is a remote and sparsely populated corner of southeastern Afghanistan composed of towering  rocky mountains interspersed with narrow gorges  Taliban fighters decided it would be the perfect area to make a stand against the Afghan government and the coalition forces  Over the course of the summer  perhaps the largest concentration of Taliban militants gathered in the area since the fall of the regime  with up to 1 000 guerrillas regrouping  Over 220 people  including several dozen Afghan police  were killed in August 2003 as Taliban fighters gained strength   edit  Coalition response A number of 1 25lb M112 Demolition Charges  consisting of a C 4 compound  sit atop degraded weaponry scheduled for destruction As a result

republics  Initial permission for the U S  military to move troop supplies through the region was given on January 20  2009  after a visit to the region by General Petraeus  162  The first shipment along the NDN route left on February 20 from Riga  Latvia  then traveled 3 212 miles  5 169 km  to the Uzbek town of Termez on the Afghanistan border  163  In addition to Riga  other European ports

which is currently involved in overhauling Navoi s airport  officially handles logistics at the site  166  Originally only non lethal resources were allowed on the NDN  In July 2009  however  shortly before a visit by President Obama to Moscow  Russian authorities announced that U S  troops and weapons could use the country s airspace to reach Afghanistan  167  Additionally  human rights advocates are concerned that the U S  is again working with the government of Uzbekistan  which is often accused of violating human rights  168  Nevertheless  U S  officials have promised increased cooperation

commanded U S  troops in Afghanistan  also expressed frustration with the relative paucity of funds set aside for spending on development and reconstruction in Afghanistan  176  In subsequent cables  Ambassador Eikenberry repeatedly cautioned that deploying sizable American reinforcements would result in  astronomical costs    tens of billions of dollars   and would only deepen the dependence of the Afghan government on the United States  On November 26  2009  Afghan President Hamid Karzai made a public plea to the United States to engage in direct negotiations with the Taliban leadership  In

can only be acceptable  and therefore effective  if all parties to the conflict are involved in the process  The present form of discussions with the Taliban is flawed  as it excludes anti Taliban Afghans  It must be recalled that the Taliban extremists and their Al Qaeda supporters were defeated by Afghans resisting extremism with minimal human embedded support from the United States and

the Afghan National Army to 134 000 soldiers by October 2010  By May 2010 the Afghan Army had accomplished this interim goal and was on track to reach its ultimate number of 171 000 by 2011  276  This increase in Afghan troops would allow the U S  to begin withdrawing American forces in July 2011  as now planned  277  The transfer of security responsibilities cannot happen unless the Afghan

frequently must remove the cell phones of Afghan soldiers hours before a mission for fear that the operation will be compromised  283  American trainers often spend large amounts of time verifying that Afghan rosters are accurate   that they are not padded with  ghosts  being  paid  by Afghan commanders who quietly collect the bogus wages  284  Desertion also is a significant problem in the

Stryker soldiers who face murder charges  359  The fifth soldier is Staff Sgt  Calvin Gibbs who has been described as the ringleader  360  A UN report in June 2011 stated that 2 777 civilians were known to have been killed in 2010  with insurgents being responsible for three quarters of the deaths  361  Another United Nations report issued in July 2011 said  1 462 non combatants died  in the first six months of 2011  with insurgents being responsible for 80 per cent of the deaths  362  A coalition report in June 2011 stated that insurgents were responsible for 85  of civilian deaths  363  In 2011 a record 3 021 civilians were killed in the ongoing insurgency  the fifth successive annual rise  364   edit  Drug trade Further information  Opium production in Afghanistan Opium production levels for 2005 2007 Regional security risks and levels of opium poppy cultivation in 2007 2008  In 2000  the Taliban had issued a ban on opium production  which led to reductions in Pashtun Mafia opium production by as much as 90   365  Soon after the 2001 U S  led invasion of Afghanistan  however  opium production increased markedly  366  By 2005  Afghanistan had regained its position as the world s No  1 opium producer and was producing 90  of the world s opium  most of which is processed into heroin and sold in Europe and Russia  367  In 2009  the BBC reported that  UN findings say an opium market worth  65bn   39bn  funds global terrorism  caters to 15 million addicts  and kills 100 000 people every year   368  While U S  and allied efforts to combat the drug trade have been stepped up  the effort is hampered by the fact that many suspected drug traffickers are now top officials in the Karzai government  367  Recent estimates by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime  UNODC  estimate that 52  of the nation s GDP  amounting to  2 7 billion annually  is generated by the drug trade  369  The rise in production has been linked to the deteriorating security situation  as production is markedly lower in areas with stable security  370  The extermination of the poppy crops is not seen as a viable option because the sale of poppies constitutes the livelihood of Afghanistan s rural farmers  Some 3 3 million Afghans are involved in producing opium  371  Opium is more profitable than wheat and destroying opium fields could possibly lead to discontent or unrest among the indigent population  372  Several alternatives to poppy eradication have been proposed  including controlled opium licensing for poppy for medicine projects   edit  Human rights abuses Main article  Human rights in Afghanistan There have been multiple accounts of human rights violations in Afghanistan  373  The fallout of the U S  led invasion  including a resurgence in Taliban forces  record high drug production  and re armed warlords  has led to a threat to the well being and rights of hundreds of thousands of innocent Afghan citizens  according to Human Rights Watch  374   edit  History of human rights abuses in Afghanistan Afghanistan has suffered extensive human rights violations over the last twenty years  The subsequent war between foreign backed militia factions brought extensive abuses by the armed factions vying for power  375  When the Taliban controlled Afghanistan it was notorious for human rights abuses against women  376  A U N  official said the Taliban committed war crimes of the same type as the ones committed in Bosnia in the 1990s  377  378  According to a 55 page report by the United Nations  the Taliban  while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan  committed systematic massacres against civilians  377  378  U N  officials stated that there had been  15 massacres  between 1996 and 2001  377  378  They also said that   t hese have been highly systematic and they all lead back to the  Taliban  Ministry of Defense or to Mullah Omar himself   377  378  The Taliban especially targeted people of Shia religious or Hazara ethnic background  377  378  Upon taking Mazar i Sharif in 1998  about 4 000 civilians were executed by the Taliban and many more reported tortured  379  380  The documents also reveal the role of Arab and Pakistani support troops in these killings  377  378  Bin Laden s so called 055 Brigade was responsible for mass killings of Afghan civilians  381  The report by the United Nations quotes eyewitnesses in many villages describing Arab fighters carrying long knives used for slitting throats and skinning people  377  378  In Afghanistan women and girls today suffer high levels of violence and discrimination and have poor access to justice and education  Human Rights Watch concluded in a December 2009 report  382  One recent nationwide survey of levels of violence against Afghan women found that 52 percent of respondents experienced physical violence  and 17 percent reported sexual violence  Yet because of social and legal obstacles to accessing justice  few women and girls report violence to the authorities  These barriers are particularly formidable in rape cases  383 UNICEF estimates that more than 80 percent of females lack access to education centers  384  Female literacy is 10   384  A member of the Taliban s religious police beats a woman in Kabul on August 26  2001   edit  Taliban According to a report by the United Nations  the Taliban were responsible for 76  of civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2009  43  The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission  AIGRC  called the Taliban s terrorism against the Afghan civilian population a war crime  44  Religious leaders condemned Taliban terrorist attacks and said these kinds of attacks are against Islamic ethics  44  According to Amnesty International  the Taliban commit war crimes by targeting civilians  including killing teachers  abducting aid workers and burning school buildings  Amnesty International said that up to 756 civilians were killed in 2006 by bombs  mostly on roads or carried by suicide attackers belonging to the Taliban  385  During the conflict  NATO has alleged that the Taliban have used civilians as human shields  As an example  NATO pointed to the victims of NATO air strikes in Farah province in May 2009  during which the Afghan government claims up to 150 civilians were killed  NATO stated that it had evidence that the Taliban forced civilians into buildings likely to be targeted by NATO aircraft involved in the battle  US Lieutenant Colonel Greg Julian  a spokesman for General McKiernan  NATO s Afghanistan commander  said of the Taliban s tactics   This was a deliberate plan by the Taliban to create a civilian casualty crisis  These were not human shields  these were human sacrifices  We have intelligence that points to this   386   NATO has not provided this intelligence to the public   The increase in Taliban power has also led to increased human rights violations against women in Afghanistan  according to the U S  State Department  387   edit  Elections during combat Several elections have been held in Afghanistan since 2001  The most recent election was held September 18  2010  for the Afghan Parliament with a reported 2 499 candidates competing for 250 seats  During the elections 388  the Taliban attacked many of those involved  killing 11 civilians and 3 Afghan National Policemen in over 300 attacks on the polls  389  The low death toll at the hands of the Taliban can be attributed to stepped up operations specifically targeting the leaders of insurgents planning attacks in the days leading up to the elections  390  391  which captured hundreds of insurgents and explosives  Turnout at election was 40    edit  Former Afghan warlords Former Afghan warlords and political strongmen supported by the US during the ousting of the Taliban were responsible for numerous human rights violations in 2003 including kidnapping  rape  robbery  and extortion  392   edit  Controversy over torture In March 2002  ABC News claimed top officials at the CIA authorized controversial  harsh interrogation techniques  393  The possible interrogation techniques included shaking and slapping  shackling prisoners in a standing position  keeping the prisoner in a cold cell and dousing them with water  and water boarding  393  A United Nations study in 2011 reported on interviews with 379 detainees  It found those held by police or intelligence services were subjected to beatings  removal of toenails and electric shocks  394   edit  White phosphorus use White phosphorus has been condemned by human rights organizations as cruel and inhumane because it causes severe burns  There are cases that have been confirmed of white phosphorus burns on the bodies of civilians wounded in Afghanistan caused by clashes between U S  and Taliban forces near Bagram  The United States claims at least 44 instances in which militants have used white phosphorus in weapons or attacks  395  In May 2009  Colonel Gregory Julian  a spokesman for General McKiernan  the overall commander of U S  and NATO forces in Afghanistan  confirmed that Western military forces in Afghanistan use white phosphorus to illuminate targets or as an incendiary to destroy bunkers and enemy equipment  396  397  US forces used white phosphorus to screen a retreat in the Battle of Ganjgal when regular smoke munitions were not available  398  The Afghan government later launched an investigation into the use of white phosphorus munitions  399   edit  See also Terrorism portal
