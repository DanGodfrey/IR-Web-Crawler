state comes from an earlier Spanish name  Arizonac  derived from the O odham name al   onak  meaning  small spring   which initially applied only to an area near the Mexican silver mining camp of Planchas de Plata  Sonora  9  10  11  12  This is supported by the fact that that area is still known as al   onak in the O odham language  13  Other possible origins that have been proposed are the Spanish phrase  rida zona   arid zone    shortened to  Arizona  or the Basque phrase aritz ona   the good oak    14  15  16   edit  Geography Saguaro at Sunset from Saguaro National Park Rincon

Southwestern United States as one of the Four Corners states  Arizona is the sixth largest state in area  after New Mexico and before Nevada  Of the state s 113 998 square miles  295 000 km2   approximately 15  is privately owned  The remaining area is public forest and park land  state trust land and Native American reservations  Arizona is best known for its desert landscape  which is rich in xerophyte plants such as the cactus  It is also known for its climate  which presents exceptionally hot summers and mild winters  Less well known is the pine covered high country of the Colorado Plateau in the north central portion of the state  which contrasts with the desert Basin and Range region in the southern portions of the state  see Arizona Mountains forests   View from Mogollon Rim Like other states of the Southwest  Arizona has an abundance of topographical characteristics in addition to its desert climate  Mountains and plateaus are found in more than half of the state  Despite the state s aridity  27  of Arizona is forest  17  a percentage comparable to modern day France or Germany  The largest stand in the world of Ponderosa pine trees is contained in Arizona  18  The Mogollon Rim  a 1 998 foot  609 m  escarpment  cuts across the central section of the state and marks the southwestern edge of the Colorado Plateau  where the state experienced its second worst forest fire ever in 2002  Arizona belongs firmly within the Basin and Range region of North America  The region was shaped by prehistoric volcanism  followed by the cooling off and related subsidence  Grand Canyon The Grand Canyon is a colorful  steep sided gorge  carved by the Colorado River  in northern Arizona  The canyon is one of the seven natural wonders of the world and is largely contained in the Grand Canyon National Park one of the first national parks in the United States  President Theodore Roosevelt was a major proponent of designating the Grand Canyon area  visiting on numerous occasions to hunt mountain lion and enjoy the scenery  The canyon was created by the Colorado River cutting a channel over millions of years  and is about 277 miles  446 km  long  ranges in width from 4 to 18 miles  6 to 29 km  and attains a depth of more than 1 mile  1 6 km   Nearly 2 billion years of the Earth s history have been exposed as the Colorado River and its tributaries cut through layer after layer of sediment as the Colorado Plateaus have uplifted  Meteor Crater Arizona is home to one of the most well preserved meteorite impact sites in the world  The Barringer Meteorite Crater  better known simply as  Meteor Crater   is a gigantic hole in the middle of the high plains of the Colorado Plateau  about 25 miles  40 km  west of Winslow  A rim of smashed and jumbled boulders  some of them the size of small houses  rises 150 feet  46 m  above the level of the surrounding plain  The crater itself is nearly 1 mile  1 6 km  wide  and 570 feet  170 m  deep  Arizona is one of two states that does not observe Daylight Saving Time  except in the Navajo Nation  located in the northeastern region of the state  The other state is Hawaii   edit  Climate The Horseshoe Bend of the Colorado River Due to its large area and variations in elevation the state has a wide variety of localized climate conditions  In the lower elevations  the climate is primarily desert  with mild winters and hot summers  Typically  from late fall to early spring  the weather is mild  averaging a minimum of 60  F  16  C   November through February are the coldest months with temperatures typically ranging from 40 75  F  4 24  C   although occasional frosts are not uncommon  About midway through February  the temperatures start to rise again with warm days  and cool breezy nights  The summer months of June through September bring a dry heat ranging from 90 128  F  32 53  C   with occasional high temperatures exceeding 128  F  53  C  having been observed in the desert area  19  Arizona s all time record high is 128  F  53  C  recorded at Lake Havasu City on June 29  1994  and July 5  2007  the all time record low of  40  F   40  C  was recorded at Hawley Lake on January 7  1971  Due to the primarily dry climate  large temperature swings often occur between day and night in less developed areas of the desert  The swings can be as large as 50  F  28  C  in the summer months  In the state s urban centers  the effects of local warming result in much higher measured nighttime lows than in the recent past  Arizona has an average annual rainfall of 12 7 inches  323 mm   20  which comes during two rainy seasons  with cold fronts coming from the Pacific Ocean during the winter and a monsoon in the summer  6  The monsoon season occurs towards the end of summer  In July or August  the dewpoint rises dramatically for a brief period  During this time  the air contains large amounts of water vapor  Dewpoints as high as 81  F  27  C  21  have been recorded during the Phoenix monsoon season  This hot moisture brings lightning  thunderstorms  wind  and torrential  if usually brief  downpours  These downpours often cause flash floods  which can turn deadly  In an attempt to deter drivers from crossing flooding streams  the Arizona Legislature enacted the Stupid Motorist Law  It is rare for tornadoes and hurricanes to occur in Arizona  but there are records of both occurring  The northern third of Arizona is a plateau at significantly higher altitudes than the lower desert  and has an appreciably cooler climate  with cold winters and mild summers  Extremely cold temperatures are not unknown  cold air systems from the northern states and Canada occasionally push into the state  bringing temperatures below 0  F   18  C  to the northern parts of the state  Indicative of the variation in climate  Arizona is the state which has both the metropolitan area with the most days over 100  F  38  C   Phoenix   and the metropolitan area in the lower 48 states with nearly the most days with a low temperature below freezing  Flagstaff   22   edit  History Main article  History of Arizona The North Rim of the Grand Canyon Marcos de Niza  a Spanish Franciscan  explored parts of the area in 1539 and met some of its original native inhabitants  probably the Sobaipuri  The expedition of Spanish explorer Coronado entered the area in 1540 1542 during its search for C bola  Father Kino was the next European in the region  A member of the Society of Jesus  he led the development of a chain of missions and converted many of the Indians to Christianity in the Pimer a Alta  now southern Arizona and northern Sonora  in the 1690s and early 18th century  Spain founded presidios   fortified towns   at Tubac in 1752 and Tucson in 1775  When Mexico achieved its independence from Spain in 1821  what is now Arizona became part of the Territory of Nueva California  also known as Alta California  23  In the Mexican American War  1847   the U S  occupied Mexico City and pursued its claim to much of northern Mexico  including what later became Arizona  The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo  1848  specified that the sum of US 15 million in compensation  equivalent to about  403 million in 2012 24   be paid to the Republic of Mexico  25  In 1853  the land below the Gila River was acquired from Mexico in the Gadsden Purchase  Arizona was administered as part of the Territory of New Mexico until southern New Mexico seceded 26  from the Union as the Confederate Territory of Arizona on March 16  1861  Arizona was recognized as a Confederate Territory by presidential proclamation of Jefferson Davis on February 14  1862  This is the first official use of the name  A new Arizona Territory  consisting of the western half of New Mexico Territory was declared in Washington  D C   on February 24  1863  The new boundaries would later form the basis of the state  Although names  including  Gadsonia    Pimeria    Montezuma  and  Arizuma  had been considered for the territory  27  when President Lincoln signed the final bill  it read  Arizona   and the name became permanent   Montezuma was not the Aztec Emperor  but the sacred name of a divine hero to the Pima people of the Gila River Valley  and was probably considered and rejected for its sentimental value before the name  Arizona  was settled upon   Brigham Young sent Mormons to Arizona in the mid to late 19th century  They founded Mesa  Snowflake  Heber  Safford and other towns  They also settled in the Phoenix Valley  or  Valley of the Sun    Tempe  Prescott  and other areas  The Mormons settled what became northern Arizona and northern New Mexico  but these areas were located in a part of the former New Mexico Territory  Children of the Depression era migrant workers  Pinal County  1937 During the Mexican Revolution from 1910 to 1920  a few battles were fought in the Mexican towns just across the border from Arizonan border settlements  Throughout the revolution  Arizonans were enlisting in one of the several armies fighting in Mexico  The Battle of Ambos Nogales in 1918  other than Pancho Villa s 1916 Columbus Raid in New Mexico  was the only significant engagement on U S  soil between American and Mexican forces  The battle resulted in an American victory  After U S  soldiers were fired on by Mexican federal troops  the American garrison then launched an assault into Nogales  Mexico  The Mexicans eventually surrendered after both sides sustained heavy casualties  A few months earlier  just west of Nogales  an Indian War battle occurred  thus being the last engagement in the American Indian Wars which lasted from 1775 to 1918  The participants in the fight were U S  soldiers stationed on the border and Yaqui Indians who were using Arizona as a base to raid the nearby Mexican settlements  as part of their wars against Mexico  Arizona became a U S  state on February 14  1912  This resulted in the end to the territorial colonization of Continental North America  Arizona was the 48th state admitted to the U S  and the last of the contiguous states to be admitted  A sunset in the Arizona desert near Scottsdale  The climate and imagery are two factors behind Arizona s tourism industry  Cotton farming and copper mining  two of Arizona s most important statewide industries  suffered heavily during the Great Depression  but it was during the 1920s and 1930s that tourism began to be the important Arizonan industry it is today  Dude ranches  such as the K L Bar and Remuda in Wickenburg  along with the Flying V and Tanque Verde in Tucson  gave tourists the chance to experience the flavor and life of the  old West   Several upscale hotels and resorts opened during this period  some of which are still top tourist draws to this day  they include the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in central Phoenix  opened 1929  and the Wigwam Resort on the west side of the Phoenix area  opened 1936   Arizona was the site of German and Italian POW camps during World War II and Japanese American internment camps  The camps were abolished after World War II  The Phoenix area site was purchased after the war by the Maytag family  of major home appliance fame   and is currently the site of the Phoenix Zoo  A Japanese American internment camp was located on Mount Lemmon  just outside of the state s southeastern city of Tucson  Another POW camp was located near the Gila River in eastern Yuma County  Because of wartime fears of Japanese invasion of the west coast  all Japanese American residents in western Arizona were required to reside in the war camps  Arizona was also home to the Phoenix Indian School  one of several federal institutions designed to forcibly assimilate Native American children into Anglo American culture  Children were often enrolled into these schools against the wishes of their parents and families  Attempts to suppress native identities included forcing the children to cut their hair and take on English names  28  Arizona s population grew tremendously after World War II  in part because of the development of air conditioning  which made the intense summers more comfortable  According to the Arizona Blue Book  published by the Arizona Secretary of State s office each year   the state population in 1910 was 294 353  By 1970  it was 1 752 122  The percentage growth each decade averaged about 20  in the earlier decades and about 60  each decade thereafter  The 1960s saw the establishment of retirement communities  special age restricted subdivisions catering exclusively to the needs of senior citizens who wanted to escape the harsh winters of the Midwest and the Northeast  Sun City  established by developer Del Webb and opened in 1960  was one of the first such communities  Green Valley  south of Tucson  was another such community and was designed to be a retirement subdivision for Arizona s teachers  Many senior citizens arrive in Arizona each winter and stay only during the winter months  they are referred to as snowbirds  In March 2000  Arizona was the site of the first legally binding election to nominate a candidate for public office ever held over the internet  29  In the 2000 Arizona Democratic Primary  under worldwide attention  Al Gore defeated Bill Bradley  and voter turnout increased more than 500  over the 1996 primary

recommended by a bi partisian commission  and are re elected after the initial two years following their appointment  Subsequent re elections occur every six years  The supreme court has appellate jurisdiction in death penalty cases  but almost all other appellate cases go through the Arizona Court of Appeals beforehand  The court has original jurisdiction in a few other circumstances  as outlined in the state constitution  The court may also declare laws unconstitutional  but only while seated en banc  The court meets in the Arizona Supreme Court Building at the capitol complex  at the southern end of Wesley Bolin Plaza   The Arizona Court of Appeals  further divided into two divisions  is the intermediate court in the state  Division One is based in Phoenix  consists of sixteen judges  and has jurisdiction in the Western and Northern regions of the state  along with the greater Phoenix area  Division Two is based in Tucson  consists of six judges  and has jurisdiction over the Southern regions of the state  including the Tucson area  Judges are selected in a method similar to the one used for state supreme court justices  Each county of Arizona has a superior court  the size and organization of which are varied and generally depend on the size of the particular county   edit  Counties This section appears to contradict itself about the population total  which does

Party  During this time period  the Democratic candidate for the presidency carried the state each election  with the only exceptions being the elections of 1920  1924 and 1928 all three of which were national Republican landslides  Since the election of Dwight D  Eisenhower in 1952  however  the state has voted consistently Republican in national politics  with the Republican candidate winning it in most presidential elections  Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan won Arizona by particularly large margins  The sole exception to this trend was the victory of Democrat Bill Clinton in 1996  Clinton also came within about a percentage point of gaining Arizona s electoral votes in 1992  However  the closest loss by a Democrat was by Lyndon Johnson in 1964  who lost the state by slightly over 5 000 votes to Senator Barry Goldwater  an Arizona native  This was also the most closely contested state in that year s presidential election  In recent years  the Republican Party has also dominated Arizona politics in general  The fast growing Phoenix and Tucson suburbs became increasingly friendly to Republicans from the 1950s onward  During this time  many  Pinto Democrats   or conservative Democrats from rural areas  became increasingly willing to support Republicans at the state and national level  While the state normally supports Republicans at the federal level  Democrats are often competitive in statewide elections  as in 2006  when Janet Napolitano was handily reelected the state s governor  On March 4  2008  John McCain effectively clinched the Republican nomination for 2008  becoming the first presidential nominee from the state since Barry Goldwater in 1964  Arizona politics are dominated by a longstanding rivalry between its two largest counties  Maricopa County and Pima County  home to Phoenix and Tucson  respectively  The two counties have almost 75 percent of the state s population and cast almost 80 percent of the state s vote  They also elect a substantial majority of the state legislature  Maricopa County is home to almost 60 percent of the state s population  and most of the state s elected officials live there  It has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1948  This includes the 1964 run of native son Barry Goldwater  he would not have carried his home state had it not been for a 20 000 vote margin in Maricopa County  Similarly  while McCain won Arizona by eight percentage points in 2008  the margin would have likely been far closer if not for a 130 000 vote margin in Maricopa County  In contrast  Pima County  home to Tucson  and most of southern Arizona have historically been more Democratic  While Tucson s suburbs lean Republican  they hold to a somewhat more moderate brand of Republicanism than is common in the Phoenix area  Arizona rejected an anti gay marriage amendment in a referendum as part of the 2006 elections  Arizona was the first state in the nation to do so  Same sex marriage was already illegal in Arizona  but this amendment would have denied any legal or financial benefits to unmarried homosexual or heterosexual couples  54  In 2008  Arizona voters passed Proposition 102  an amendment to the state constitution to define marriage as a union of one man and one woman  though by a narrower majority than similar votes in a number of other states  55  In 2010  Arizona passed the toughest illegal immigration legislation in the nation  igniting a fierce debate between supporters and detractors of the law  56   edit  Important cities and towns Downtown Phoenix Yuma Flagstaff
