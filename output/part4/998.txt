Ditko  the Green Goblin  as we know him  was entirely his creation  He claims  Stan s synopsis for the Green Goblin had a movie crew  on location  finding an Egyptian like sarcophagus  Inside was an ancient  mythological demon  the Green Goblin  He naturally came to life  On my own  I changed Stan s mythological demon into a human villain  9  The Green Goblin debuted in The Amazing Spider Man  14  At this time his identity was unknown  but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues  which made a point of his secret identity  Apparently  Lee and Ditko disagreed on who he should be  According to one theory  Lee always wanted him to be someone Peter Parker knew  while Ditko wanted him to be a stranger  feeling this was closer to real life  10  Ditko has refuted this rumor  however  claiming  So I had to have some definite ideas  who he was  his profession and how he fit into the Spider Man story world  I was even going to use an earlier  planted character associated with J  Jonah Jameson  he  was to  be  revealed as  the Green Goblin  It was like a subplot working its way until it was ready to play an active role  9  Ditko left the series with issue  38  before he could reveal the Goblin s identity  and Lee subsequently unmasked him in the next issue as Norman Osborn  a character who had been introduced two issues earlier as the father of Harry Osborn  John Romita  Sr   who replaced Ditko as the title s artist  recalls  Stan wouldn t have been able to stand it if Ditko did the story and didn t reveal that the Green Goblin was Norman Osborn  I didn t know there was any doubt about Osborn being the Goblin  I didn t know that Ditko had just been setting Osborn up as a straw dog  I just accepted the fact that it was going to be Norman Osborn when we plotted it  I had been following the last couple of issues and didn t think there was really much mystery about it  Looking back  I doubt the Goblin s identity would have been revealed in Amazing  39 if Ditko had stayed on  11  The Amazing Spider Man  14  July 1964   the Green Goblin s first appearance  the character originally used a turbo fan powered  flying broomstick   Cover art by Steve Ditko  After the Green Goblin killed Peter Parker s girlfriend Gwen Stacy  writer Gerry Conway decided that the Goblin had to pay a heavy price  Osborn accidentally caused his own death in the course of a fight against Spider Man  Others  such as Harry Osborn  later adopted the Green Goblin identity  and writer Roger Stern later introduced the Hobgoblin to replace the Green Goblin as Spider Man s archenemy  12   edit  Return This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  During the Clone Saga storyline  the Spider Man writers were met with a massive outcry from many readers after the decision to replace Peter with his clone Ben Reilly as the true Spider Man  Eventually  the writers decided to reveal that one of Spider Man s arch enemies had been manipulating events from behind the scenes  The initial plan was to use Mephisto  but they felt a more down to earth character was needed  13  It was then suggested that the semi zombified cyborg known as  Gaunt  be revealed as Harry Osborn  who had been killed in Spectacular Spider Man  200  Gaunt was a late entry to the controversial storyline  created mainly as a plot device to return Harry to life  the plan for the character included Harry regaining his humanity  taking credit for tricking Peter Parker into thinking he was a clone  and resuming his identity as the Green Goblin full time  However  the plotline was changed by newly promoted editor in chief Bob Harras  who disliked the Harry Osborn character  and instead chose Norman be the mastermind  revealing Gaunt as Mendel Stromm  Osborn briefly reprised his original evil businessman role  minimizing his Goblin identity  in the lead up to  The Final Chapter   which closed out the first volume of Amazing Spider Man   edit  New roles Following the  Civil War  story arc  Warren Ellis began writing Thunderbolts  14  and Osborn was brought into the title as the director of the team  He was one of several characters offered to Ellis  who picked him because  according to Thunderbolts editor Molly Lazer    t here was something about Norman  his instability  and his fixation with Spider Man that Warren liked  so he s in the book   15  Ellis admitted not being very familiar with the character  saying   all I remember of the Norman Osborn character was from the Spider Man reprints my parents used to buy me when I was very young  and Norman Osborn was this guy with a weird rippled crewcut who was always sweating and his eyes were always bulging out of his head  That guy as a Donald Rumsfeld like public governmental figure     Joe Quesada  talked me into writing the book while I was still laughing   16  Lazer confirmed that the new team was answerable to the Commission on Superhuman Activities  giving him the opportunity to do what he wanted   He s a free man with a lot of power      And his agenda  well  it s not that secret  He wants to get Spider Man   17  Writer Christos Gage took over for the Secret Invasion tie in stories  18  19  which ended with Osborn taking credit for the defeat of the Skrulls  after he killed the Skrull queen Veranke  20  This allowed the character to be placed into an influential position in the aftermath  Dark Reign  Although the dark turn at the end was always part of the plan for the storyline  Brian Michael Bendis  Secret Invasion s writer  says that Osborn was picked for the leading role because of the changes implemented by Ellis   While I was putting it together  Warren  Ellis  s Thunderbolts run made it very clear that if one would choose to do so  Norman was on track to head toward this kind of storyline  very organically  very in character  and very much within the realm of what was going on   21  Bendis stated   Norman s team is made up of people who are outstanding at what they do  These are bad ass  hardcore get it done types  They ll close the door and take care of business  and he s dressing them up to make them something that the people want   22  Meanwhile  Andy Diggle took over the writing of Thunderbolts  23  He introduced new characters to serve as Osborn s black ops team  explaining   Norman selected agents with stealth  infiltration and assassination skills rather than overt flying and fighting type powers  24  and  now that he s reached a higher level  he s reconfiguring the Thunderbolts into something much more covert and much more lethal  his own personal hit squad   25  Diggle s Osborn is still mad   To quote the movie Speed  he s  crazy  not stupid   He s clearly fiercely intelligent and a natural born leader  with the ego and competitive drive to succeed against all odds  He also just happens to be crazy as a shithouse rat   He describes his take on Osborn   I think the secret to understanding Norman is that he doesn t realize he s the villain  He thinks he s the hero  He truly believes that he deserves public adulation  and it bugs the hell out of him that so called  superheroes  are getting it instead of him   26  Osborn next starred in the five issue miniseries Osborn that was a tie in to the  Big Time  storyline in The Amazing Spider Man  27  by writer Kelly Sue DeConnick and artist Emma Rios  looking at the character s life in prison   28   edit  Fictional character biography  edit  Pre Goblin years Norman Osborn  the son of industrialist Ambrose Osborn  was born in New Haven  Connecticut  Although Ambrose was a brilliant student in the fields of science  he was also an alcoholic who lost control of his company and was abusive toward his family  In one incident  Ambrose locked Norman in one of the Osborn family s empty estates in an attempt to toughen him  It was in that darkened mansion that Norman felt haunted by a  green  goblin like  creature that was  waiting to pounce on him   29  All of these events had a severe impact on Norman  planting the seeds of the megalomaniac he would eventually become  Norman would stop at nothing to regain the wealth that his father had lost  In college  where he studies chemistry and electrical engineering  Norman Osborn meets his sweetheart Emily  gets married  and eventually has a son who he names Harry  In his adulthood  he co founds a major firm with his former professor Dr  Mendel Stromm called Osborn Industries  of which he is owner and president  However  Emily becomes ill and dies when Harry is barely a year old  30  This tragedy pushes Osborn to work harder  leading him to emotionally neglect Harry  Hoping to gain more control of Osborn Industries  Norman accuses Stromm of embezzlement and has him arrested  Osborn then searches Stromm s possessions  discovering an experimental strength intelligence enhancement formula  31  When Osborn attempts to create the serum  it turns green and explodes in his face  The accident greatly increases his intelligence and physical abilities  but also drives him to destructive insanity   edit  Enter the Goblin The Amazing Spider Man  39  Aug  1966   Cover art by John Romita  Sr  Osborn adopts the bizarre identity of the Green Goblin based on the monster he feared in his childhood with the goal of becoming boss of the city s organized crime  He intends to cement his position by defeating Spider Man  As the Green Goblin  he would bedevil Spider Man many times but fail to achieve his goal  He first assembled the Enforcers and claimed he was shooting a film about Spider Man for which Spider Man would be paid  50 000  Spider Man battled them in the desert  first thinking they were actors  Finally they battled him in a cave and were defeated  However Spider Man then was attacked by the Hulk  who was hiding there  Spider Man hid from the Hulk  then turned the Enforcers over to the police  while the Goblin escaped  Later the Goblin encountered Spider Man again  but left after the Human Torch got embroiled in the battle  He tried to take over a mob led by  Lucky  Lobo  and led Spider Man to their base  hoping the leader would be defeated  but they were defeated and arrested by Spider Man  Spider Man battled the Goblin again  but he escaped  The Green Goblin revealed his identity to a criminal called the Crime Master and vice versa  However a rivalry developed between them  They tried to take over gangs  and the Green Goblin succeeded in knocking out Spider Man just before he attended a meeting of numerous criminals  Hoping to use this to persuade the gangs to join him  he took Spider Man in  But Spider Man recovered and defeated the crooks  but the Green Goblin flew away and the Crime Master escaped by using gas to delay Spider Man  Later when the Crime Master tried to attack the Daily Bugle offices  he was shot by the police  He tried to reveal the identity of the Goblin  but died just before he could  It was then revealed he was  Lucky  Lobo  32  Stromm returns and attempts revenge with an army of robots  but apparently dies of a heart attack after someone apparently tries to shoot him through the window  33  Osborn discovers that college student Peter Parker  a classmate of Harry s  is Spider Man after exposing Spider Man to a gas that weakens his spider sense with the aid of a gang of ordinary crooks  and allows him to be observed  Osborn captures Parker after knocking him out with an asphyxiation grenade  catching him off guard at home and concerned for Aunt May  The Green Goblin bound Peter with a steel rope and took him to his waterfront base  He then ties him to a steel chair with the intention of torturing Peter with suspense  revealing his identity to the world  and killing Peter while he is completely helpless and at his mercy  He reveals his true identity and origin to Peter  who stalls Osborn long enough to free one hand  Seeing this  The Green Goblin releases Spider Man for what he intends to be their climactic battle  Spider Man defeats Osborn  who loses his memory after being knocked into a mass of electrical wires  and destroys the Goblin costume in the resulting fire  34  Osborn is troubled by repressed memories  which he takes as hallucinations  of the Green Goblin and Spider Man  A presentation on supervillains by NYPD Captain George Stacy restores Osborn s memory  but after a brief return to his Green Goblin persona  in which he abducts Parker s friends and threatens Parker s elderly Aunt May  he is exposed to one of his own  psychedelic bombs   inducing another amnesia spell  35  In The Amazing Spider Man  96  Osborn stumbles upon an old Green Goblin hideout which again restores his memory  The Goblin battles Spider Man in this and the following two issues  until Spider Man leads Osborn to see his son Harry Osborn hospitalized  overdosed on drugs  The shock causes Osborn s amnesia to return yet again  In issue  121  June 1973   his memory having been regained  the Green Goblin throws Parker s love  Gwen Stacy  from a tower of either the Brooklyn Bridge  as depicted in the art  or the George Washington Bridge  as given in the text   36  37  She dies during Spider Man s rescue attempt  a note on the letters page of issue  125 states   It saddens us to say that the whiplash effect she underwent when Spidey s webbing stopped her so suddenly was  in fact  what killed her   38  The following issue  the Goblin appears to accidentally kill himself in the ensuing battle with Spider Man when he is impaled by his Glider  Years after Gwen s death  it is revealed that Osborn had a one night stand with Gwen after she s overwhelmed by his charisma which in turn leads to her pregnancy with his twin children  Gabriel and Sarah  Osborn thus has three motives for killing Gwen  revenge against Spider Man  to prevent her talking of their affair and creating a scandal  and to take their children to raise by himself thus becoming his ideal heirs  The only person who knew of their liaison and the existence of their children was Mary Jane Watson  who despises Osborn for his immoral behaviors long before discovering he s the villainous Green Goblin  39   edit  Return The Green Goblin formula endowed Osborn with a healing factor that allowed him to circumvent his otherwise certain death  Osborn  no longer suffering from bouts of amnesia  escapes from a morgue and goes to Europe  where he can move freely and unnoticed  He becomes the leader of the Scrier cabal  which he utilizes to carry out revenge on Parker using Seward Trainer  Judas Traveller  the Jackal  and Mendel Stromm  who is now the cyborg like Gaunt  as his pawns  It is this group of individuals who become crucial in duping Parker during the controversial 40  1990s storyline the  Clone Saga   in which a clone of Parker  created in 1970s comics by the Jackal and dubbed Ben Reilly  returns to New York City  Osborn reemerges in Parker s life  and initially convinces Parker that Parker is the clone and Reilly the original  When Parker learns the truth  Osborn kills Reilly  the real clone  41  It is later revealed that he also raises his illegitimate children  Gabriel and Sarah  while in Europe and tells them that Peter Parker is their father and murdered their mother as Spider Man  42  The returned Osborn devises a contrived story to explain his absence and regains control of his business  He even uses a Goblin stand in so as not to be suspected of being the Green Goblin  He also crosses paths with Roderick Kingsley  the original Hobgoblin  and initiates a hostile takeover of the latter s corporate empire in retaliation for raiding the Goblin arsenal and identity  Osborn joins a cult hoping to receive great power but instead goes further into madness  43  Osborn comes to see Parker as the son he had always wanted and attempts to have Parker take on the Goblin mantle using physiological torture but ultimately fails  44  Osborn s next plan involves using a drunken Flash Thompson to drive a truck into Midtown High School  resulting in an accident that causes Thompson brain damage  This successfully enrages Parker into what Osborn anticipates will be a climactic battle  During this confrontation  an emotionally weary Parker tells Osborn he is tired of this roundelay  and declares a truce  45  Osborn s identity as the Green Goblin is revealed to the public through an investigation by the Daily Bugle after Osborn murders one of its reporters  After a battle with Spider Man and Luke Cage  Osborn is arrested and sent to prison for the first time  46  Regardless  Osborn masterminds a plot that forces Spider Man himself to help him escape  47  Osborn escapes to Paris but is apprehended by S H I E L D  agents  48   edit  Rise and fall Norman Osborn as the Iron Patriot Osborn attempts to distance himself from his Green Goblin persona after being prescribed medication  During the  Civil War  over the Superhuman Registration Act  Osborn is appointed director of the superhero team the Thunderbolts  now tasked to apprehend anyone who resists registering  During the  Secret Invasion  by the shape shifting alien race the Skrulls  Osborn kills the Skrull queen Veranke  leader of the invasion  by shooting her  He leverages this widely publicized success in defeating the Skrulls to replace Tony Stark as director of S H I E L D   which he in turn replaces with H A M M E R   a paramilitary force he uses to advance his agenda  49  Osborn simultaneously formed an alliance called the Cabal with Doctor Doom  Emma Frost  Namor  Loki  and the Hood  50  but this  alliance  quickly falls apart when Namor and Frost betrayed the Cabal to aid the X Men  His attempts to exert his authority were increasingly jeopardized by various superheroes  This includes Tony Stark tricking Osborn into attacking him while Stark was suffering from brain damage in his original suit of armor  thus showing Osborn brutally assaulting a man physically and mentally incapable of even attempting to strike back   51  and the New Avengers using a tracking device Osborn had planted in Luke Cage to trick Osborn into blowing up his own house  52  Osborn then creates a rationale to invade Asgard  claiming it poses a national security threat  During a pitched battle with several superheroes  the Sentry causes Asgard to fall to Earth  Stark removes the Iron Patriot s armor remotely  revealing a maddened Osborn wearing green facepaint with yellow paint to create a goblin like look  He tells them they are all dead as the Void is released  53  Osborn knocks out Captain America and tries to escape  but is captured by Volstagg  and is incarcerated in The Raft penitentiary  where he blames his Green Goblin alter ego for ruining his chance to protect the world  54   edit  Prison break When transferred to a secret government base somewhere underwater  Osborn quickly began taking steps to ensure his release from prison where he meets June Covington and Ai Apaec  He uses a  Green Goblin Cult  he has assembled to stage a break out with the aid of various corrupt senators so that he could turn himself in after eliminating most of his fellow inmates  creating a new impression of him as a  champion  of the judicial system that he may use in future  55  He was subsequently broken out of prison when the government attempted to relocate him to another prison in preparation for his trial  despite the efforts of the New Avengers to prevent any such attack  due to most of the men in the prison belonging to his group  56  With his followers explaining the public perception of him as a voice for the  disenfranchised  who do not believe in Captain America s right to take charge  Osborn sets out to assemble a new team of Dark Avengers  concluding that what he has learned in prison will make it far easier for him to use the team  properly  this time  While planning to regain his Iron Patriot armor  Norman Osborn recruits Barney Barton to become his new Hawkeye  recruits Hulk s son Skaar to become his Hulk  has Superia become his new Ms  Marvel  has June Covington become his Scarlet Witch  has Ai Apaec become his new Spider Man  has Gorgon become his new Wolverine  and has A I M  rebuild Ragnarok to serve as his Thor  57  In the team s first fight with the New Avengers  Norman Osborn demonstrates a new level of strength where he manages to throw Luke Cage in a considerable distance  58  With both Avengers teams occupied  Norman declares himself the new head of world security  ordering that the Avengers be arrested and charged with various war crimes  59  However  despite possessing the power of the Super Adaptoid  Osborn s plans are defeated when all of the Avengers attack him at once  the multiple powers his body has absorbed overloading his system  leaving him in a coma with apparent brain damage while H A M M E R  is disbanded  leaving A I M  and Hydra to pick up the remnants of his resources as Osborn is taken to prison once again  60   edit  Powers  abilities  and weaknesses Norman Osborn was turned into the Green Goblin by a chemical solution he had devised based upon a formula originally conceived by Professor Mendel Stromm  The process granted Osborn superhuman agility  strength  speed  stamina  and dexterity  as well as a  healing factor  that allows him to quickly heal even from such lethal bodily damage as being stabbed through the chest by large blades  Following his time in prison  undisclosed events have apparently increased his strength considerably  where he was once approximately as strong as Spider Man  he now possesses sufficient strength to overpower and throw Luke Cage a significant distance away from him without any sign of a costume  volume  amp  issue needed  as being able to defeat the Vision in an aerial conflict between the two  volume  amp  issue needed  It is revealed later on that that A I M scientists converted Osborn into a Super Adaptoid  capable of absorbing the abilities of any mutant  mutate  alien  android or otherwise by touching them  He is known to have absorbed the abilities of Luke Cage  Vision  Red Hulk  and Protector  it is suggested that he also absorbed the abilities of his current Dark Avengers  and he absorbed the abilities of all the Avengers and New Avengers when they all touched him at once  However  the unstable combination of their multiple different powers caused significant damage to his body chemistry  resulting in him becoming comatose  volume  amp  issue needed  In addition to these physical advantages  the serum also greatly enhanced Norman s already above average intellect  making him a bona fide genius capable of making breakthroughs in advanced areas of genetics  robotics  engineering  physics and applied chemistry  The Goblin formula is also said to have driven Osborn insane  defects in his personality were strongly augmented by the serum  resulting in dangerous mood swings and hallucinations   edit  Weapons of the Green Goblin The Green Goblin is armed with a variety of bizarre devices  He travels on his bat shaped  Goblin Glider   an incredibly fast and maneuverable rocket glider equipped with various armaments  Other weapons the Goblin uses include incendiary Pumpkin Bombs  smoke  and gas emitting grenades resembling ghosts and jack  o  lanterns  razor edged boomerang like throwing weapons  resembling bats  and gloves woven with micro circuited filaments which channel pulsed discharges of electricity at nearly 10 000 volts  He wears a green costume underneath bulletproof chainmail with an overlapping purple tunic  His mask has a built in gas filter to keep him safe from his own gasses   edit  Goblin Glider The Goblin Glider s controls and microprocessor are located behind the head of the glider  The pilot is attached to the glider via electromagnetic clasps on the wings of the glider  It has great maneuverability and is steered mostly by leaning  but manual controls are available behind the head of the glider  The Green Goblin later added radio linked voice controls to his mask  Its top speed is 90 miles per hour  140 km h   and it can support about 400 lb  180 kg   though it could lift far more for brief periods  Flying at top speed with a full load and a full fuel tank would deplete its fuel supply in about an hour  The glider possesses a wide array of armaments  including heat seeking and smart missiles  machine guns  extending blades  a flamethrower and a pumpkin bomb dispenser launcher   edit  Pumpkin Bomb A grenade used by the Green Goblin  the Pumpkin Bomb resembles a miniature Jack o  lantern and  when thrown ignites almost soundlessly and produces enough heat to melt through a 3 inch  76 mm  thick sheet of steel  The Goblin carries these and a variety of other weapons in a shoulder bag he calls his  Bag Of Tricks   The Green Goblin has a range of other  Pumpkin Bombs  at his disposal  including smoke  and gas emitting bombs  Some release hallucinogenic gases  while others emit a specially created mixture that neutralizes Spider Man s spider sense for a limited period of time  All of these are covered in a light plastic mantle that flutters like a ghost when thrown   edit  Weapons as the Iron Patriot During the events of the  Dark Reign   Osborn created a new identity  the Iron Patriot  an amalgam of Captain America and Iron Man   to cement his standing as a hero  As the Iron Patriot  he utilized a version of Iron Man s armor  The armor featured superhuman strength  enhanced durability via a pliable crystalline material with a molecular structure that can collimate into super hard planes upon the application of an electrical field  flight  magnetic impact blasts  heat seeking missiles  miniaturized lasers  flamethrowers  and a communications system housed in his helmet which allowed him to interface with any U S  controlled satellite or computer network  While the original Iron Man armor utilized repulsor technology  Osborn s design does not  Stark destroyed all but one repulsor  and stated that  Oz is too stupid  to make his own repulsor based weapons system  The star shaped Uni Beam projector on his chest  because of its shape  also has a less powerful output than that of the original Iron Man model  61   edit  Mental illness and other weaknesses Norman Osborn has consistently been depicted with several unusual weaknesses related to his psychosis and to his personality  He suffers from manic depression  He has a pronounced narcissistic personality disorder co morbid with severe anti social psychopathic traits and in some depictions  multiple personality disorder  For some of his early appearances he and the Goblin were separate personalities  his Goblin side disdaining his human weaknesses while his other side was primarily motivated by his concern for Harry  although his anger over his son s failing health as  Norman  helped to provoke his transformation back into the Goblin  his other side never reappearing after he was believed dead   He is also highly sadistic  showing a complete lack of empathy for the lives of innocent people who stand between him and his objectives  These weaknesses have often been referenced in stories featuring him and exploited by his enemies  In Thunderbolts Norman Osborn is shown to be severely manic depressive  62  This has been referenced several times in a myriad of Spider Man stories  When he is not under the direction of a psychiatrist and taking medication  he has dangerous mood swings  At the apex of his mania  he is paranoid  delusional  and suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations  including hearing the voice of his Green Goblin persona and seeing its face in the mirror rather than his own  Previously  Osborn s arrogance caused him to refuse to submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced to  he viewed mental illness as an imperfection and therefore would not admit that he is mentally ill  In later conversations with the Sentry  Osborn revealed that he had come to accept his own mental illness  There are many examples of Osborn s pronounced superiority complex  to the point that he will rarely  if ever  admit that he has made mistakes  transferring blame for his shortcomings to others or claiming that he was better than he was  even before his accident  he spent more time providing Harry with gifts or outings rather than actually being there for his son or trying to listen to his problems  and nevertheless claims that he was still a good father  Having become the Goblin  he generally views other people as dim witted pests  lacking in creative vision  unworthy to be graced by his presence  He goes out of his way to remind others of their personal failures and shortcomings and to remind those in close relationships with him  such as his son  that they are incapable of measuring up to his achievements  When he first learned Spider Man s identity  he claimed that when Spider Man had defeated him in their previous battles  none of those victories counted because Spider Man had only beaten his lackeys or been rescued by the intervention of other super powered beings such as the Human Torch  despite the fact that he always departed the battles after Spider Man s victories rather than trying to defeat his foe himself  63  He also missed the opportunity to lead the original Sinister Six because he felt that joining the group would mean admitting he needed the help of others to rid himself of Spider Man  64  Although he later formed the  Sinister Twelve  when Spider Man sent him to prison  he expressed anger at Mac Gargan for acquiring the Venom symbiote rather than using the new Scorpion suit provided for him simply because Gargan wasn t doing what he wanted despite Venom being more powerful than the Scorpion  volume  amp  issue needed  When he participated in the mystical ritual known as the Gathering of Five  he appeared convinced that he would automatically receive the gift of power from the ritual   which would bestow upon the participants power  immortality  knowledge  madness and death  respectively   only to receive the gift of madness instead  65  subsequently requiring an elaborate cocktail of drugs to restore himself to a semblance of sanity  During his time in charge of H A M M E R  he was provoked into attacking Asgard by his Goblin side because his ego couldn t allow himself to consider the possibility that the Asgardians wouldn t threaten his power 66  Later events revealed that Loki at least slightly influenced Osborn s decision to further Loki s own goals  volume  amp  issue needed  During his attempted takeover of Earth s superhuman security defenses  he was shown reflecting that humans are all barbarians who require the strong like him to control them  dismissing the Avengers as no better than him  volume  amp  issue needed  It has been shown that since having suppressed the rampaging Green Goblin personality and becoming the more dominant personality  Osborn has proven to be just as  if not more  evil and cruel  Osborn has demonstrated a high degree of sadism  While he was in prison  a guard once asked him for his advice in helping his critically ill wife  Osborn s advice led her to a quicker and more agonizing death  As director of the Avengers  he allowed Bullseye to continue to function as an Avenger  even after Bullseye allowed over thirty innocent bystanders to be killed during a skirmish with a supervillain  67  As director of H A M M E R  he directed his officers to shoot down an airplane full of innocent people just to see whether his enemy  Pepper Potts  was powerful enough to rescue the passengers with her Rescue variant of the Iron Man armor  68  Because these actions threatened the hero persona he had carefully crafted some in the media began to see him for what he really was  and many of his highly credible former enemies spoke out against him  His Goblin persona vied for control of his body  as depicted in the January 2010 issue of Dark Avengers  where he is shown writhing on the floor and imploring  apparently to himself   Why won t this face come off       and finally took over when Osborn was defeated by Iron Man at the end of the  Siege  arc  69   edit  Other Goblins Main article  Green Goblin  set index  While Norman was presumed dead  several other villains and one hero took up the mantle of the Green Goblin  A few other villains also created separate Goblin mantles   edit  Other versions Main article  Alternative versions of the Green Goblin As a fictional character  the Green Goblin has appeared in a number of media  from comic books to films and television series  Each version of the character is typically established within its own continuity within parallel universes  to the point where distinct differences in the portrayal of the character can be identified  Various versions of the Goblin are depicted in works such as Marvel s Ultimate line and Earth X   edit  In other media Main article  Green Goblin in other media The Green Goblin has appeared in many Spider Man related media   edit  Television In television  the Green Goblin appeared in the 1960s Spider Man animated TV series voiced by Len Carlson  and in the Spider Man episode  Revenge of the Green Goblin   He also appears in
