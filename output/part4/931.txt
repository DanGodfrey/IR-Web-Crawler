catholic   derived from the Greek word            katholikos   which means  universal  or  general   was first used to describe the Church in the early 2nd century  14  The term katholikos is equivalent to          katholou   a contraction of the phrase            kath  holou  meaning  according to the whole   15  Thus the full name Catholic Church roughly means  universal  or  whole  church  The combination  the Catholic Church   he katholike ekklesia  is found for the first time in the letter of St Ignatius  written about the year 110  The words run   Wheresoever the bishop shall appear  there let the people be  even as where Jesus may be  there is the universal  katholike  Church   16  Later  in the  Catechetical Discourses  of St  Cyril of Jerusalem we see the name  Catholic Church  to identify the church from various sects  St Cyril writes   And if ever thou art sojourning in any city  inquire not simply where the Lord s house is  for the sects of the profane also attempt to call their own dens  houses of the Lord  nor merely where the church is  but where is the Catholic Church  For this is the peculiar name of the holy body the mother of us all   16  Since the East West Schism of 1054  the churches that remained in communion with the See of Rome  the diocese of Rome and its bishop  the Pope  the primal patriarch  continued to call itself  Catholic   while the Eastern churches that rejected the Pope s primal authority have generally been known as  Orthodox  or  Eastern Orthodox   17  Following the Reformation in the 16th century  the Church continued to use the term  Catholic  to distinguish itself from the various Protestant denominations that split off  17  The name  Catholic Church  is the most common designation used in official church documents  e g   the Catechism of the Catholic Church   18  It is also the term which Paul VI used when signing the 16 documents of the Second Vatican Council  19  However  Church documents produced by both the Holy See 20  and by certain national episcopal conferences 21  occasionally refer to the Church by the name Roman Catholic Church  The Catechism of Pope Pius X published in 1908 also used the term  Roman  to distinguish the Catholic Church from other Christian communities who are not in full communion with Rome  22   edit  Organisation and demographics Catholic Church Major

Saint Peter  Represented in a painting by Pietro Perugino  The Church s hierarchy is headed by the Bishop of Rome  the pope  a position which makes him the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church  which is composed of the Latin Rite and the Eastern Catholic Churches in full communion with the see of Rome   The current office holder is Pope Benedict XVI  who was elected in a papal conclave on 19 April 2005  note 5  The office of the pope is known as the Papacy  His ecclesiastical jurisdiction is often called the  Holy See   Sancta Sedes in Latin   or the  Apostolic See   meaning the see of the Apostle Saint Peter   23  24  Directly serving the Pope is the Roman Curia  the central governing body that administers the day to day business of the Catholic Church  The pope is also head of state of Vatican City State  25  a sovereign city state entirely enclaved within the city of Rome  Following the death or resignation of a pope  note 6  members of the College of Cardinals who are under age 80 meet in the Sistine Chapel in Rome to elect a new pope  27  The position of cardinal is a rank of honour bestowed by popes on certain ecclesiastics  such as leaders within the Roman Curia  bishops serving in major cities and distinguished theologians  Although this election  known as a papal conclave  can theoretically elect any male Catholic as pope  since 1389 only fellow cardinals have been elevated to that position  28  For advice and assistance in governing  the Pope may turn to the College of Cardinals  the next highest level in the hierarchy  29   edit  Autonomous particular churches Main articles  Latin Church and Eastern Catholic Churches The Catholic Church is made up of 23 autonomous particular churches  each of which accepts the paramountcy of the Bishop of Rome on matters of doctrine  30  These churches  also known by the Latin term sui iuris churches  are communities of Catholic Christians whose forms of worship reflect different historical and cultural influences rather than differences in doctrine  In general  each sui iuris church is headed by a patriarch or high ranking bishop  31  and has a degree of self governance over the particulars of its internal organisation  liturgical rites  liturgical calendar and other aspects of its spirituality  The largest of these is the Latin Church which reports over 1 billion members  The Pope and Roman Curia is head of the Latin Church  which developed in Western world  particularly the Italian Peninsula and Southern France before spreading throughout the world  The Latin Church considered itself to be the oldest and largest branch of Christianity  a heritage of certain beliefs and customs shared by many Christian denominations that trace their originals to Protestant Reformation  Relatively small in terms of adherents compared to the Latin Church  but important to the overall structure of the Church  are the 22 self governing Eastern Catholic Churches with a membership of 17 3 million as of 2010  32  The Eastern Catholic Churches follow the traditions and spirituality of Eastern Christianity and are composed of Eastern Christians who have always remained in full communion with the Catholic Church or who have chosen to reenter full communion in the centuries following the East West Schism and earlier divisions  Some Eastern Catholic Churches are governed by a patriarch who is elected by the synod of the bishops of that church  33  others are headed by a major archbishop  34  others are under a metropolitan  35  and others consist of individual eparchies  36  The Roman Curia has a specific department  the Congregation for the Oriental Churches  to maintain relations with them  Examples of Eastern Catholic Churches can be found in the side bar  Major Sui Iuris

Catholic bishop  Each diocese is united with one of the worldwide  sui iuris  particular churches  such as the Latin Church  or one of the many Eastern Catholic Churches  As of 2008  the Catholic Church altogether comprised 2 795 dioceses  37  The bishops in a particular country or region are often organised into an episcopal conference  38  which aids in maintaining a uniform style of worship and co ordination of social justice programmes within the areas served by member bishops  Dioceses are further divided into numerous individual communities called parishes  each staffed by one or more priests  deacons  and or lay ecclesial ministers  39  Parishes are responsible for the day to day celebration of the sacraments and pastoral care of the Catholic laity  Ordained Catholics  as well as members of the laity  may enter into consecrated life either on an individual basis  as a hermit or consecrated virgin  or by joining an institute of consecrated life  a religious institute or a secular institute  in which to take vows confirming their desire to follow the three evangelical counsels of chastity  poverty and obedience  40  Examples of institutes of consecrated life are the Benedictines  the Carmelites  the Dominicans  the Franciscans  the Missionaries of Charity and the Sisters of Mercy  40   edit  Membership statistics Further information  Catholicism by country Total church membership  both lay and clerical  in 2007 was 1 147 billion people  41  increasing from the 1950 figure of 437 million 42  and the 1970 figure of 654 million  43  On 31 December 2008  membership was 1 166 billion  an increase of 11 54  over the same date in 2000  only slightly greater than the rate of increase of the world population  10 77    The increase was 33 02  in Africa  but only 1 17  in Europe  It was 15 91  in Asia  11 39  in Oceania  and 10 93  in the Americas  As a result  Catholics were 17 77  of the total population in Africa  63 10  in the Americas  3 05  in Asia  39 97  in Europe  26 21  in Oceania  and 17 40  of the world population  Of the world s Catholics  the proportion living in Africa grew from 12 44  in 2000 to 14 84  in 2008  while those living in Europe fell from 26 81  to 24 31   44  Membership in the Catholic Church is attained through baptism or reception into the Church  for individuals previously baptised in non Catholic Christian churches   45  For some years until 2009  if someone formally left the Church  that fact was noted in the register of the person s baptism  At the end of 2007  Vatican records listed 408 024 Catholic priests in the world  762 more than at the beginning of the year  The main growth areas have been Asia and Africa  with 21 1 per cent and 27 6 per cent growth respectively  In North and South America  numbers have remained approximately the same  while there was a 6 8 per cent decline in Europe and a 5 5 per cent decrease in Oceania from 2000 to 2007  41   edit  Worship and liturgy Main article  Catholic liturgy Altar in St Mary s Church in Alexandria  Virginia  The altar is at the centre of Catholic worship because it is there that the  Holy Sacrifice of the Mass  takes place  Among the 23 autonomous  sui iuris  churches  numerous forms of worship and liturgical traditions exist  called  rites   which reflect historical and cultural diversity rather than differences in belief  46  In the definition of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches   a rite is the liturgical  theological  spiritual and disciplinary patrimony  culture and circumstances of history of a distinct people  by which its own manner of living the faith is manifested in each Church sui iuris   47  but the term is often limited to liturgical patrimony  The most commonly used liturgy is the Roman Rite  but even in the Latin Catholic Church a few other rites are in use  and the Eastern Catholic Churches have distinct rites   edit  Celebration of the Eucharist In all rites the Mass  or Divine Liturgy  is the centre of Catholic worship  The Catholic Church teaches that at each Mass the bread and wine are supernaturally transubstantiated into the body and blood of Christ by the words of consecration spoken by the priest  48  The words of consecration are drawn from the three synoptic Gospels and a Pauline letter  49  The Church teaches that Christ established a New Covenant with humanity through the institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper  as described in these biblical verses  Hoc est enim corpus meum           Roman Missal  during the words of consecration  Latin    50  Because the Church teaches that Christ is present in the Eucharist  51  there are strict rules about who may confect and who may receive the Eucharist  The sacrament can only be celebrated by an ordained Catholic priest or bishop  Those who are conscious of being in a state of mortal sin are forbidden from receiving the sacrament until they have received absolution through the sacrament of Reconciliation  Penance   52  Catholics are normally obliged to abstain from eating for at least an hour before receiving the sacrament  52  Catholics are not permitted to receive the Eucharist as celebrated in Protestant churches  which in the view of the Catholic Church lack the sacrament of Holy Orders  and thus also lack a valid Eucharist  53  Likewise  Protestants are not normally permitted to receive communion in the Catholic Church  This is because unity with the Catholic faith is seen as necessary before one can partake of the Church s sacraments  In relation to the churches of Eastern Christianity not in communion with the Holy See  the Catholic Church is less restrictive  declaring that  a certain communion in sacris  and so in the Eucharist  given suitable circumstances and the approval of Church authority  is not merely possible but is encouraged   54   edit  Western liturgical rites Catholic Church Structure of theRoman Rite of Mass The Roman Missal and Communion Chalice A

Rite is the most common rite of worship used by the Catholic Church  Its use is found worldwide  spread by missionary activity originating in European Catholic nations throughout Christian history  56  Two forms of the Roman Rite are authorised at present  that of the post 1969 editions of the Roman Missal  Mass of Paul VI   which is now the ordinary form of the rite and is celebrated mostly in the vernacular  i e   the language of the people  and that of the 1962 edition  the Tridentine Mass   now an extraordinary form  51  note 7  An outline of the major liturgical elements of Roman Rite Mass can be found in the side bar  In the United States   Anglican Use  parishes have been created  They use a variation of the Roman rite that retains some of the wording of the Anglican liturgical rites  note 8  Implementation is expected of the authorisation granted in 2009 for the creation wherever appropriate of ordinariates for groups of Anglicans who have been approved for entrance into the Catholic Church and who may in the future use a rite that incorporates elements of Anglican tradition  57  Other Western liturgical rites  non Roman  include the Ambrosian Rite and the Mozarabic Rite   edit  Eastern liturgical rites An Eastern Catholic bishop of the Syro Malabar Church holding the Mar Thoma Cross which symbolises the heritage and identity of the Saint Thomas Christians of India The liturgical rites of the Eastern Catholic Churches are very similar to  and often identical with  the rites used by the Eastern Orthodox and other Eastern Christian churches which historically developed in Russia  Caucasus and the Balkans  Northeastern Africa and the Middle East  but are no longer in communion with the Bishop of Rome  the Pope  The Eastern Catholic Churches are either groups of faithful which have restored full communion with the Bishop of Rome  while preserving their identity as Eastern Christians  or groups with which full communion has never been broken  The rites used by the Eastern Catholic Churches include the Byzantine rite  in its Antiochian  Greek and Slavonic varieties  the Alexandrian rite  the Syriac rite  the Armenian rite  the Maronite rite and the Chaldean rite  In the past some of the rites used by the Eastern Catholic Churches were subject to some degree of liturgical Latinisation  However  in recent years Eastern Catholic Churches have returned to traditional Eastern practices in accord with the Vatican II decree Orientalium Ecclesiarum  Each church has its own liturgical calendar   edit  Doctrine This section relies on references

also  Catholic theology and Catholic social teaching The fundamental beliefs of the Christian religion are summarised in the Nicene Creed  For Catholics  they are detailed in the Catechism of the Catholic Church  58  59  Based on the promises of Christ in the Gospels  the Church believes that it is continually guided by the Holy Spirit and so protected infallibly from falling into doctrinal error  60  The Catholic Church teaches that the Holy Spirit reveals God s truth through Sacred Scripture  Sacred Tradition and the Magisterium  61  Sacred Scripture consists of the 73 book Catholic Bible  This is made up of the 46 books found in the ancient Greek version of the Old Testament known as the Septuagint 62  and the 27 New Testament writings first found in the Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209 and listed in Athanasius  Thirty Ninth Festal Letter  63  note 9  Sacred Tradition consists of those teachings believed by the Church to have been handed down since the time of the Apostles  64  Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition are collectively known as the  deposit of faith   depositum fidei   These are in turn interpreted by the Magisterium  from magister  Latin for  teacher    the Church s teaching authority  which is exercised by the Pope and the College of Bishops in union with the Pope  the bishop of Rome  65   edit  Trinity Crucifixion of Christ by Albrecht Altdorfer  1526 The Catholic Church holds that there is one eternal God  who exists as a mutual indwelling of three persons  God the Father  God the Son  and the Holy Spirit  which make up the Trinity  Catholics believe that Jesus Christ is the second person of the Trinity  God the Son  In an event known as the Incarnation  through the power of the Holy Spirit  God became united with human nature through the conception of Christ in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary  Christ therefore is both fully divine and fully human  It is taught that Christ s mission on earth included giving people his teachings and providing his example for them to follow as recorded in the four Gospels  66  The Church teaches that through the passion  suffering  of Christ and his crucifixion as described in the Gospels  all people have an opportunity for forgiveness and freedom from sin  and so can be reconciled to God  67  The Resurrection of Jesus gained for humans a possible spiritual immortality previously denied to them because of original sin  68  By reconciling with God and following Christ s words and deeds  an individual can enter the Kingdom of God  which is the      reign of God over people s hearts and lives   69  The Greek term  Christ  and the Hebrew  Messiah  both mean  anointed one   referring to the Christian belief that Jesus  death and resurrection are the fulfillment of the Old Testament s Messianic prophecies  70   edit  Apostolicity According to the Catechism  the Catholic Church professes to be the  sole Church of Christ   which is described in the Nicene Creed as the One  Holy  Catholic  and Apostolic Church  71  The church teaches that its founder is Jesus Christ  who appointed the twelve Apostles to continue his work as the Church s earliest bishops  72  Catholic belief holds that the Church  is the continuing presence of Jesus on earth   73  and that all duly consecrated bishops have a lineal succession from the apostles  74  In particular  the Bishop of Rome  the Pope   is considered the successor to the apostle Simon Peter  from whom the Pope derives his supremacy over the Church  75  The Church is further described in the papal encyclical Mystici Corporis Christi as the Mystical Body of Christ  76  The Church teaches that the fullness of the  means of salvation  exists only in the Catholic Church  but the Church acknowledges that the Holy Spirit can make use of Christian communities separated from itself to  impel towards Catholic unity  and thus bring people to salvation  It teaches that anyone who is saved is saved through the Church but that people can be saved ex voto and by pre baptismal martyrdom as well as when conditions of invincible ignorance are present  60  although invincible ignorance in itself is not a means of salvation   edit  Sacraments A priest during a baptism in Italy According to the Council of Trent  Christ instituted seven sacraments and entrusted them to the Church  77  These are Baptism  Confirmation  the Eucharist  Reconciliation  Penance   Anointing of the Sick  formerly called Extreme Unction  one of the  Last Rites    Holy Orders and Holy Matrimony  Sacraments are visible rituals that Catholics see as signs of God s presence and effective channels of God s grace to all those who receive them with the proper disposition  ex opere operato   78  The Catechism of the Catholic Church categorises the sacraments into three groups  the  sacraments of Christian initiation    sacraments of healing  and  sacraments at the service of communion and the mission of the faithful   These groups broadly reflect the stages of people s natural and spiritual lives which each sacrament is intended to serve  79   edit  Sacraments of Christian initiation Main article  Sacraments of Initiation  edit  Baptism As viewed by the Catholic Church  Baptism is the first of three sacraments of initiation as a Christian  80  It washes away all sins  both original sin and personal actual sins  81  It makes a person a member of the Church  82  As a gratuitous gift of God that requires no merit on the part of the person who is baptised  it is conferred even on children  83  who  though they have no personal sins  need it on account of original sin  84  If a new born child is in a danger of death  anyone   be it a doctor  a nurse  or a parent   may baptise the child citation needed   Baptism marks a person permanently and cannot be repeated  85  The Catholic Church recognises as valid baptisms conferred even by people who are not Catholics or Christians  provided that they intend to baptise   to do what the Church does when she baptises   and that they use the Trinitarian baptismal formula  86  Pope Benedict XVI celebrates the Eucharist at the canonization of Frei Galv o in S o Paulo  Brazil on 11 May 2007  edit  Eucharist For Catholics  the Eucharist is the sacrament which completes Christian initiation  87  is the perpetuation of the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross  88  and a banquet in which Christ himself is consumed  89  The Eucharistic sacrifice always includes prayers  readings from the Bible  consecration of wheat bread and grape wine  and communion by at least some of the participants  in particular the priest  in the consecrated elements  90  which by the consecration become  in a way surpassing understanding  the body and blood of Jesus Christ  91  a change known as transubstantiation  92  The ceremony in which a Catholic first receives the Eucharist is known as First Communion   edit  Confirmation The Catholic Church sees the sacrament of confirmation as required to complete the grace given in baptism  93  When adults are baptised  confirmation is normally given immediately afterwards  94  a practice followed even for infants in the Eastern Catholic Church  95  In the West confirmation of children is delayed until they are old enough to understand or even until they are in their teens  96  In Western Christianity  particularly Catholicism  the sacrament is called confirmation  because it confirms and strengthens the grace of baptism  in the Eastern Church  it is called chrismation  because the essential rite is the anointing of the person with chrism  97  a mixture of olive oil and some perfumed substance  usually balsam  blessed by a bishop  98  Those who receive confirmation must be in a state of grace  which for those who have reached the age of reason means that they should first be cleansed spiritually by the sacrament of Penance  they should also have the intention of receiving the sacrament  and be prepared to show in their lives that they are Christians  99   edit  Sacraments of healing  edit  Penance A Catholic believer prays in a church in Mexico  The sacrament of penance  also called reconciliation  forgiveness  confession and conversion 100   exists for the conversion of those who  after baptism  separate themselves from Christ by sin  101  Essential to this sacrament are acts both by the sinner  examination of conscience  contrition with a determination not to sin again  confession to a priest  and performance of some act to repair the damage caused by sin  and by the priest  determination of the act of reparation to be performed and absolution   102  Serious sins  mortal sins  must be confessed within at most a year and always before receiving Holy Communion  while confession of venial sins also is recommended  103  The priest is bound under the severest penalties to maintain the  seal of confession   absolute secrecy about any sins revealed to him in confession  104   edit  Anointing of the Sick While chrism is used only for the three sacraments that cannot be repeated  baptism  confirmation  ordination   a different oil is used by a priest or bishop to bless a Catholic who  because of illness or old age  has begun to be in danger of death  105  This sacrament  known as Anointing of the Sick  is believed to give comfort  peace  courage and  if the sick person is unable to make a confession  even forgiveness of sins  106  Although it is not reserved for those in proximate danger of death  it is often administered as one of the Last Rites   edit  Sacraments at the service of communion According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church there are two sacraments of comunion directed towards the salvation of others  priesthood and marriage  CCC 1534   Within the general vocation to be a Christian  these two sacraments consecrate to specific mission or vocation among the people of God  Men receive the holy orders to feed the Church by the word and grace  Spouses marry so that their love may be fortified to fulfil duties of their state  CCC 1535    edit  Ordination Holy Orders is a sacrament in three degrees or orders  episcopate  bishops   presbyterate  priests  and diaconate  deacons   which consecrates and deputes some Christians to serve the whole body by these specific titles  107  The Church has defined rules on who may be ordained into the clergy  In the Latin Rite  the priesthood and diaconate are generally restricted to celibate men  108  109  Men who are already married may be ordained in the Eastern Catholic Churches in most countries  110  and may become deacons even in the Western Church 108  109   see Clerical marriage   But after becoming a Roman Catholic priest  a man may not get married  see Clerical celibacy   All clergy  whether deacons  priests  or bishops  may preach  teach  baptise  witness marriages and conduct funeral liturgies  111  Only bishops and priests can administer the sacraments of the Eucharist  Reconciliation  Penance  and Anointing of the Sick  112  113  Only bishops can administer the sacrament of Holy Orders  which ordains someone into the clergy  114   edit  Matrimony Marriage  understood as an indissoluble union between a man and a woman  115  if entered into validly by any baptised man and woman  is considered a sacrament by the Catholic Church  116  20th centur Magisterium of the Church spoke a lot about the dignity and holiness of sexual love as an important part of the sacrament of marriage  The encyclical letter of Pope Paul VI Humanae vitae  1968  attracted interest more than any other magisterial document  The debate over contraception  which the encyclical was meant to conclude  after more than forty years still continues  Magisterium competence  moral norms  intrinsically evil acts  personal conscience and the Church  procreation s place within marriage  natural law  117  118  119 John Paul II developed the catechesis of the Vaticanum II on the sacrament of marriage in two major works  exhortation Familiaris Consortio  1981  and Wednesday General Audience catecheses Man and Woman He created Them  A Theology of the Body  Human body reveals the person  It has spousal meaning and is meant to be for a husband and wife a means of mutual self gift  According to the Pope  In the body and through the body  one touches the person himself in his concrete reality   John Paul II  Discourse to the World Medical Association  Oct  29  1983  120  Marriage union is also a sacramental sign of Christ and the Church  cf  Eph 5 32  121   It is one of main reasons why the church does not recognise divorce as ending a valid marriage and allows state recognized divorce only as a means of protecting children or property  without allowing remarriage following such a divorce  Apart from the requirements such as freedom of consent that it sees as applicable to all  the church has established certain specific requirements for the validity of marriages by Catholics  122  Failure to observe the Church s regulations  as well as defects applicable to all marriages  may be grounds for a church declaration of the invalidity of a marriage  a declaration usually referred to as an annulment  123   edit  Judgement after death The Church teaches that  immediately after death  the soul of each person will receive a particular judgment from God  124  This teaching also attests to another day when Christ will sit in a universal judgment of all mankind  This final judgment  according to Church teaching  will bring an end to human history and mark the beginning of a new and better heaven and earth ruled by God in righteousness  124  The basis on which each person s soul is judged is detailed in the Gospel of Matthew  which lists works of mercy to be performed even to people considered  the least of Christ s brothers   125  Emphasis is upon Christ s words that  Not everyone who says to me   Lord  Lord   shall enter the kingdom of heaven  but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven   126  According to the Catechism   The Last Judgement will reveal even to its furthest consequences the good each person has done or failed to do during his earthly life   126  Depending on the judgement rendered  a soul may enter one of three states of afterlife  Heaven is a time of glorious union with God and a life of unspeakable joy that lasts forever  124  Purgatory is a temporary condition for the purification of souls who  although saved  are not free enough from sin to enter directly into heaven  124  Souls in purgatory may be aided in reaching heaven by the prayers of the faithful on earth and by the intercession of saints  127  Final Damnation  Finally  those who persist in living in a state of mortal sin and do not repent before death subject themselves to hell  an everlasting separation from God  124  The Church teaches that no one is condemned to hell without having freely decided to reject God  124  No one is predestined to hell and no one can determine whether anyone else has been condemned  124  Catholicism teaches that through God s mercy a person can repent at any point before death and be saved  128  Some Catholic theologians have speculated that the souls of unbaptised infants who die in original sin are assigned to limbo although this is not an official doctrine of the Church  129   edit  Virgin Mary The Blessed Virgin Mary is highly regarded in the Catholic Church  proclaiming her as Mother of God  sinless  free from original sin and as an intercessor  Main articles  Blessed Virgin Mary  Roman Catholic  and Roman Catholic Mariology See also  Mary  mother of Jesus  Devotions to Mary are part of Catholic piety but are distinct from the worship of God  130  The Church holds Mary  as Perpetual Virgin and Mother of God  in special regard  Catholic beliefs concerning Mary include her Immaculate Conception without the stain of original sin and bodily assumption into heaven at the end of her life  both of which have been infallibly defined as dogma  by Pope Pius IX in 1854 and Pope Pius XII in 1950 respectively  131  Mariology deals not only with her life but also her veneration in daily life  prayer and Marian art  music and architecture  Several liturgical Marian feasts are celebrated throughout the Church Year and she is honoured with many titles such as Queen of Heaven  Pope Paul VI called her Mother of the Church because  by giving birth to Christ  she is considered to be the spiritual mother to each member of the Body of Christ  131  Because of her influential role in the life of Jesus  prayers and devotions such as the Rosary  the Hail Mary  the Salve Regina and the Memorare are common Catholic practices  132  The Church has affirmed certain Marian apparitions  as at Lourdes  F tima  Guadalupe 133  and the Shrine of Our Lady of Good Help  134  Pilgrimages to these sites are popular Catholic devotions  135   edit  History Main article

giving the keys of heaven to Saint Peter   edit  Apostolic period Catholic tradition and doctrine holds that the Catholic Church was founded by Jesus Christ in the 1st century AD in Judea within the Roman Empire  The New Testament records Jesus  activities and teaching  his appointment of the twelve Apostles and his instructions to them to continue his work  136  137  The Catholic Church teaches that the coming of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles  in an event known as Pentecost  signalled the beginning of the public ministry of the Catholic Church  74 Catholic doctrine teaches that the contemporary Catholic Church is the continuation of this early Christian community  It interprets the Confession of Peter found in the Gospel of Matthew as Christ s designation of Saint Peter the Apostle and his successors  the Bishops of Rome to be the temporal head of his Church  a doctrine known as apostolic succession  138  139  140  141   edit  Spread throughout the Roman Empire Conditions in the Roman Empire facilitated the spread of new ideas  The empire s well defined network of roads and waterways allowed for easier travel  while the Pax Romana made it safe to travel from one region to another  The government had encouraged inhabitants  especially those in urban areas  to learn Greek  and the common language allowed ideas to be more easily expressed and understood  142  Unlike most religions in the Roman Empire  however  Christianity required its adherents to renounce all other gods  a practice adopted from Judaism  see Idolatry   The Christians  refusal to join pagan celebrations meant they were unable to participate in much of public life  which caused non Christians including government authorities to fear that the Christians were angering the gods and thereby threatening the peace and prosperity of the Empire  The resulting persecutions were a defining feature of Christian self understanding until Christianity was legalised in the 4th century  143  In 313  the struggles of the Early Church were lessened by the legalisation of Christianity by the Emperor Constantine I  In 380  Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire by the decree of the Emperor  which would persist until the fall of the Western Roman Empire and  later  with the Eastern Roman Empire until the Fall of Constantinople  During this time  the period of the Seven Ecumenical Councils  there were considered five primary sees according to Eusebius  Rome  Constantinople  Antioch  Jerusalem and Alexandria  known as the Pentarchy   edit  Middle Ages After the destruction of the Western Roman Empire  the Western Christianity was a major factor in the preservation of classical civilisation  citation needed  establishing monasteries and sending missionaries to convert the peoples of northern Europe as far as Ireland in the north  In the Eastern Christianity  the Byzantine Empire preserved Orthodoxy well after the massive invasions of Islam in the mid 7th century  The invasions of Islam devastated three of the five Patriarchal sees  capturing Jerusalem first  then Alexandria  and then finally  in the mid 8th century  Antioch  The whole period of the next five centuries was dominated by the struggle between Christianity and Islam throughout the Mediterranean Basin  The battles of Poitiers and Toulouse preserved the Catholic tradition even though Rome itself was ravaged in 850 and Constantinople was besieged   edit  Doctrine disputes and schisms See also  Criticism of Catholic actions in history In the 11th century  already strained relations between the primarily Greek church and the Latin church in the developed into the Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity respectively  partially due to conflicts over Papal authority  The fourth crusade and the sacking of Constantinople by renegade crusaders proved the final breach  In the 16th century  in response to the Protestant Reformation  the Catholic Church engaged in a process of substantial reform and renewal  known as the Counter Reformation  144  In subsequent centuries  Catholicism spread widely across the world despite experiencing a reduction in its hold on European populations due to the growth of religious scepticism during and after the Enlightenment  In 1854 Pope Pius IX with the support of the overwhelming majority of Roman Catholic bishops  whom he had consulted from 1851 to 1853  proclaimed the dogma of the Immaculate Conception  145  In 1870  the First Vatican Council affirmed the doctrine of papal infallibility when exercised in specifically defined pronouncements  146  147  Controversy over this and other issues resulted in a breakaway movement called the Old Catholic Church  148   edit  Second Vatican Council The Second Vatican Council in the 1960s introduced the most significant changes to Catholic practices since the Council of Trent four centuries before  Initiated by Pope John XXIII  this ecumenical council modernised the practices of the Catholic Church  allowing the Mass to be said in the vernacular  local language   and encouraging  fully conscious  and active participation in liturgical celebrations   149  It intended to engage the Church more closely with the present world  aggiornamento   which was described by its advocates as an  opening of the windows   150  In addition to changes in the liturgy  it led to changes to the Church s approach to ecumenism  151  and a call to improved relations with non Christian religions  especially Judaism  in its document Nostra Aetate  152  The Council  however  generated significant controversy in implementing its reforms  proponents of the  Spirit of Vatican II  such as Swiss theologian Hans K ng claimed Vatican II had  not gone far enough  to change church policies  153 Traditionalist Catholics  such as Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre  however  strongly criticised the council  arguing that the council s liturgical reforms led  to the destruction of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and the sacraments   among other issues  154   edit  New evangelisation Pope John Paul II recognised the need to evangelise an increasingly secular world and used new means to reach the faithful  He instituted World Youth Day  a  worldwide encounter with the Pope   for young people from all over the world which is celebrated every two to three years  155  He travelled more than any other pope  visiting 129 countries and preaching the Gospel in nearly every part of the world  156  He also used television and radio as means of spreading the Gospel   edit  Contemporary

was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her humanitarian work among India s poor  159  Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo won the same award in 1996 for  work towards a just and peaceful solution to the conflict in East Timor   160   edit  Sexuality and gender issues See also  Catholic teachings on sexual morality and Catholic ordination of women Soon after the close of the Second Vatican Council  Church teachings about sexuality became an issue of increasing controversy due to changing cultural attitudes in the Western world  see the Sexual Revolution   In his encyclical Humanae Vitae 161   1968   Pope Paul VI rejected all artificial contraception  though he permitted the regulation of births by means of natural family planning   contradicting those voices in the Church that saw at the time the birth control pill as an ethically justifiable method of contraception  This teaching was continued especially by John Paul II in his encyclical Evangelium Vitae  where he decried contraception and abortion as well as euthanasia as symptoms of a  culture of death  and called for a  culture of life   162  Efforts in support of the ordination of women led to several rulings by the Roman Curia or Popes against the proposal  as in Declaration on the Question of the Admission of Women to the Ministerial Priesthood  1976   Mulieris Dignitatem  1988  and Ordinatio Sacerdotalis  1994   According to the latest ruling  found in Ordinatio Sacerdotalis  Pope John Paul II concluded   I declare that the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the Church s faithful   163  In defiance of these rulings  opposition groups such as Roman Catholic Womenpriests have performed alleged ordination ceremonies  with  reputedly  an ordaining male Catholic bishop in the first few instances  which  according to canon law  are both illicit and invalid and considered mere simulations 164  of the sacrament of Ordination  165  note 10  The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith responded by issuing a statement clarifying that any Catholic bishops involved in ordination ceremonies for women  as well as the women themselves if they were Catholic  would automatically receive the penalty of excommunication  latae sententiae  literally  sentence passed   i e  automatically   citing canon 1378 of canon law and other church laws  166   edit  Sex abuse cases In the 1990s and 2000s  the issue of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy became the subject of media coverage and public debate in the United States  Ireland  Australia and other countries  The Church was criticised for its handling of abuse complaints when it became known that some bishops had shielded accused priests  transferring them to other pastoral assignments where some continued to commit sexual offences  In response to the scandal  the Church has established formal procedures to prevent abuse  encourage reporting of any abuse that occurs and to handle such reports promptly  although groups representing victims have disputed their effectiveness  167  In September 2011  a submission was lodged with the International Criminal Court alleging that the Pope  Cardinal Angelo Sodano dean of the College of Cardinals  Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone Vatican Secretary of State and Cardinal William Levada head of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith  had committed a crime against humanity by failing to prevent or punish perpetrators of rape and sexual violence in a  systematic and widespread  concealment which included failure to co operate with relevant law enforcement agencies  168  In a statement to the Associated Press  the Vatican described this as a  ludicrous publicity stunt and a misuse of international judicial processes   Lawyers and law professors emphasised that the case is likely to fall outside the court s jurisdiction  Additionally  forcing the Vatican to submit to the ICC could prove impossible to the court  David Chandler  professor of international relations at the University of Westminster in London  saw in the action  more of an ethical statement before the international community than a real attempt at a court case   169   edit  See also Catholicism portal Religion portal Theology Catholic Church by country  edit  References and notes  edit  Footnotes   Catechism of the Catholic Church  para  77   In order that the full and living Gospel might always be preserved in the Church the apostles left bishops as their successors  They gave them their own position of teaching authority   Indeed   the apostolic preaching  which is expressed in a special way in the inspired books  was to be preserved in a continuous line of succession until the end of time   6    Declaration on the Unicity and Salvific Universality of Jesus Christ and the Church  Dominus Iesus   17  Therefore  there exists a single Church of Christ  which subsists in the Catholic Church  governed by the Successor of Peter and by the Bishops in communion with him  The Churches which  while not existing in perfect communion with the Catholic Church  remain united to her by means of the closest bonds  that is  by apostolic succession and a valid Eucharist  are true particular Churches  Therefore  the Church of Christ is present and operative also in these Churches  even though they lack full communion with the Catholic Church  since they do not accept the Catholic doctrine of the Primacy  which  according to the will of God  the Bishop of Rome objectively has and exercises over the entire Church   Catechism of the Catholic Church  para  890   The mission of the Magisterium is linked to the definitive nature of the covenant established by God with his people in Christ  It is this Magisterium s task to preserve God s people from deviations and defections and to guarantee them the objective possibility of professing the true faith without error  Thus  the pastoral duty of the Magisterium is aimed at seeing to it that the People of God abides in the truth that liberates  To fulfill this service  Christ endowed the Church s shepherds with the charism of infallibility in matters of faith and morals  The exercise of this charism takes several forms     According to the Apostolic Constitution Munificentissimus Deus  paragraph 44      we  Pope Pius XII  pronounce  declare  and define it to be a divinely revealed dogma  that the Immaculate Mother of God  the ever Virgin Mary  having completed the course of her earthly life  was assumed body and soul

Rite Mass until superseded in 1969 by the Roman Missal of Paul VI  its continued use  in the version found in the 1962 edition of the Missal  is authorized by the 2007 motu proprio Summorum Pontificum    In 1980  Pope John Paul II issued a pastoral provision that allows establishment of personal parishes in which members of the Episcopal Church  the U S  branch of the Anglican Communion  who join the Catholic Church retain many aspects of Anglican liturgical rites as a variation of the Roman rite  Such  Anglican Use  parishes  numbering fewer than ten  exist only in the United States    The 73 book Catholic Bible contains the Deuterocanonicals  books not in the modern Hebrew Bible and not upheld as canonical by Protestants  62  The process of determining which books were to be considered
