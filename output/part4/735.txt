the United States of America or Assemblies of God USA  AG USA  is a Pentecostal Christian denomination in the United States founded in 1914 during a meeting of Pentecostal ministers at Hot Springs  Arkansas  With a constituency of over 3 million  4  it was ranked the ninth largest denomination in the United States in 2011  6  The Assemblies of God USA is the U S  branch of the World Assemblies of God Fellowship  the world s largest Pentecostal body  The Assemblies of God holds to a conservative  evangelical and Arminian theology as expressed in the Statement of Fundamental Truths and position papers  which emphasize such core Pentecostal doctrines as the baptism in the Holy Spirit  speaking in tongues  divine healing and the Second Coming of Christ  7  8  It defines for itself a fourfold mission to evangelize  worship God  disciple believers  and show compassion  9  The fellowship s polity is a hybrid of presbyterian and congregational models  1  2  This tension between local independence and national authority is seen in the AG s historical reluctance to refer to itself as a denomination  preferring the terms fellowship and movement  10  The national headquarters are in Springfield  Missouri  where the administrative and executive offices and Gospel Publishing House are located  It maintains relationships with other Pentecostal groups at both regional and national levels through the Pentecostal Charismatic Churches of North America and the Pentecostal World Fellowship  It is also a member of the Wesleyan Holiness Consortium and the National Association of Evangelicals  11  12  Contents 1 Beliefs 1 1 Fundamental doctrines 1 2 Core beliefs 1 2 1 Salvation 1 2 2 Baptism in the Holy Spirit 1 2 3 Divine healing 1 2 4 Christ s Second Coming 1 3 Position

beliefs of the Assemblies of God are summarized in its Statement of Fundamental Truths  7  Numerous other Christian groups share some or all of these tenets  and some positions are considered more central to the faith than others  The following is a summary of these 16 non negotiable Truths  The Bible is inspired by God and is  the infallible  authoritative rule of faith and conduct   There is only one true God who exists as a Trinity  Jesus Christ is the Son of God and  as the second person of the Trinity  is God  Man was created good by God but was separated from God through original sin  Salvation  is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ   For more information  see the Core beliefs section below  There are two ordinances  Believer s baptism by immersion is a declaration to the world of the believer s faith in Christ  The Lord s Supper is a symbolic remembrance of Christ s suffering and death  Baptism in the Holy Spirit is a separate and subsequent experience following conversion  Spirit baptism brings empowerment to live an overcoming Christian life and to be an effective witness  For more information  see the Core beliefs section below  Speaking in tongues is the initial physical evidence of the baptism in the Holy Spirit  Sanctification is  an act of separation from that which is evil  and of dedication unto God   It occurs when the believer identifies with  and has faith in  Christ in his death and resurrection  It is not believed to be a  second definite work of grace   see Finished Work   as in some other Pentecostal denominations  but is understood to be a process in that it requires continual yielding to the Holy Spirit  The Church s mission is to seek and save all who are lost in sin  the Church is the Body of Christ and consists of all people who accept Christ  regardless of Christian denomination  Divinely called and scripturally ordained ministers serve the Church  Divine healing of the sick is provided for in the atonement  The  imminent and blessed hope  of the Church is its rapture preceding the bodily return of Christ to earth  The rapture of the Church will be followed by the visible return of Christ and his reign on earth for a thousand years  For more information  see the Core beliefs section below  There will be a final judgment and eternal damnation for the  wicked dead   There will be future new heavens and a new earth  wherein dwelleth righteousness    edit  Core beliefs The AG considers salvation  baptism in the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues  divine healing and the Second Coming of Christ to be its four core beliefs  13   edit  Salvation Main article  Christian soteriology The Statement of Fundamental Truths states   Man s only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son of God   The Assemblies of God holds the Arminian position on salvation  while it agrees with the Calvinist position that God is sovereign  at the same time  it believes that mankind has free will free to accept or reject God s gift of salvation and eternal life  14  Therefore  the Assemblies of God disapproves of the doctrines of double predestination and the unconditional security of the believer which holds that once saved it is impossible for a person to be lost  15  Instead  the Assemblies of God believes that salvation is received and kept by faith  if faith in Christ is lost  then salvation is lost   edit  Baptism in the Holy Spirit Main article  Baptism with the Holy Spirit Randolph Assembly of God  Randolph  Tennessee According to the Statement of Fundamental Truths   All believers are entitled to and should ardently expect and earnestly seek  the baptism in the Spirit  It also states   This was the normal experience of all in the early Christian Church   It is a separate experience from and occurs after salvation  This baptism gives to the receiver an  enduement of power for life and service  the bestowment of the gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry   There are four experiences listed in the Fundamental Truths that result from Spirit baptism   overflowing fullness of the Spirit    a deepened reverence for God   intensified consecration and dedication to God and his work  and  a more active love for Christ  for His Word and for the lost   The  initial physical sign  of having received this baptism is  speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance   This experience initiates the believer in the use of spiritual gifts  Baptism in the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues is not a requirement for membership or participation in an Assembly of God church  However  it is a requirement for ministerial licensing and ordination  16  The practical implication of this is that candidates for ministry who have not had this experience are not eligible for formal ministry  Given the congregational elements of AG polity  the culture of each Assembly of God church varies  In some churches  the practice of speaking in tongues is common while in others it rarely occurs  An increasing minority of pastors has expressed concern that there is a lack of biblical support for the claim that Spirit baptism must always be accompanied with speaking in tongues  17  This concern corresponds with a decrease in the number of Assembly of God adherents reporting baptism in the Holy Spirit  according to the AG s Office of Statistics as of 2003 less than 50 percent of adherents had this experience  18  These challenges to the AG s traditional position were noted in a 2007 report by the AG s Spiritual Life Committee  Yet  the distinctive doctrine that once united us has  in some circles  become a point of contention  We lament the increasing rarity of the gifts of the Spirit in our worship setting  We wonder where  in our busy church schedules  will people have an opportunity to tarry at the altars for a transforming Pentecostal experience  19  Despite these challenges  the 53rd General Council in 2009 passed a resolution reaffirming the doctrine of initial physical evidence  20   edit  Divine healing Main article  Divine healing The Assemblies of God understands divine healing to have been provided for in the atonement  Looking to scripture  such as James 5 and Isaiah 53 5  the AG believes that Christians can pray for healing  Indeed  it believes scripture gives elders of the church the responsibility to pray  the prayer of faith  over the sick  It believes God can and does heal  but believes that God is sovereign and that  whether one is healed or not  a person s trust must be in God  21  It sees no conflict in trusting God for healing and receiving medical care  Healing testimonies regularly appear in the official publication  the Pentecostal Evangel  and prayer for healing and testimony commonly occur in church services  While adamant that divine healing is a reality  the AG is not dogmatic on the subject of how one is healed  Margaret Poloma summarized this view stating   Physical healing is not certain  automatic  or subject to formula  At the same time  it remains a tenet and practice of the Assemblies of God   22  It rejects the view that healing is caused or influenced by positive confession  as found in Word of Faith teachings  nevertheless  given the somewhat decentralized nature of the fellowship  these teachings have influenced some congregations   edit  Christ s Second Coming Main article  Second Coming of Christ The Statement of Fundamental Truths articles 13 and 14 articulate the Assemblies of God s official teaching on the return of Christ to Earth  It is a dispensationalist and premillennialist eschatology which includes the pre Tribulation rapture of the Church the  imminent and blessed hope   The rapture of the Church will be followed by Christ s visible return to earth and his reign of 1 000 years  This millennial reign will usher in the salvation of the nation of Israel and universal peace  The Assemblies of God is specifically opposed to the theologies and practices of universal salvation  setting dates for Christ s return  post Tribulation rapture  and amillennialism  23   edit  Position statements The Assemblies of God has released statements on various issues not addressed in the Statement of Fundamental Truths  8  These position papers are usually written by the Doctrinal Purity Commission  a standing committee of the General Council  which reviews and responds to issues referred to it by the Executive Presbytery  Most position papers are not official positions of the Assemblies of God unless recommended by the Executive Presbytery and approved by the General Council  24  Position statements touch on biblical  theological  and social concerns  Abstinence from alcohol  On the consumption of alcohol  the AG calls on its members and adherents to live life styles of total abstinence  see Christianity and alcohol   25  Apostles and Prophets  The Assemblies of God does not recognize titles or offices of  apostle  and  prophet   It does  however  believe there are those in the church who  exercise the ministry function of apostles and prophets   26  Apostolic functions relate to evangelizing previously unreached areas or people groups  while prophetic functions  occur when believers speak under the anointing of the Spirit to strengthen  encourage  or comfort    Prophecy is a continuing gift of the Holy Spirit that is broadly distributed as the Spirit wills throughout Pentecostal churches   27  Predictive prophecy that proves false or prophecy which  departs from biblical truth  is false prophecy  The AG believes in the four ministry gifts of apostles  prophets  evangelists  and pastor teachers  see Fivefold ministry  but notes that there are no biblical instructions for the appointment of apostles and prophets today  Assisted suicide and abortion  Viewing all human life as sacred  the Assemblies of God opposes assisted suicide and abortion  unless the life of the mother is endangered   It believes scripture is silent on the use of contraception and therefore takes no position on this subject  see Christian views on suicide  Christianity and abortion and Christian views on contraception   28  Creation  The Assemblies of God believes that the account of creation in the book of Genesis  accurately communicates God s creation of the heavens and the earth  and that  the New Testament treats the creation and fall of Adam and Eve as historical events   It acknowledges that Christians will have different views on  the age of the earth  the age of humankind  and the ways in which God went about the creative processes  but urges them to  avoid divisiveness over debatable theories of creation   It also affirms that  God reveals himself both in Scripture and the created order   see Creationism   29  Demon Possession  The Assemblies of God believes it is possible for people to be demon possessed and to be delivered by the  power of the Spirit  and the name of Jesus   However  it cautions against overemphasis on demonology and rejects the belief that Christians can be possessed by evil spirits  30  Ministry to the disabled  The AG teaches that people with disabilities are loved by God  They should be treated with dignity and fully included in the life of the Church  31  Divorce and remarriage  Officially  the AG disapproves of Christians divorcing for any cause except  fornication and adultery   Where these circumstances exist or where a Christian has been divorced by an unbeliever  see Pauline privilege   the AG allows  the question of remarriage to be resolved by the believer in the Light of God s Word   For Christians who were divorced and remarried before their conversion  it is recommended that local AG churches receive them as members  32  The General Council has offered this guideline for AG churches  however  churches are free to determine their own standards of membership with the result that many local churches will admit divorced and remarried persons as members even if the above conditions are not met  see Christian views on divorce   33  Gambling  The AG opposes gambling  believing that it is a disregard of responsible stewardship  involves a chance of gain at the expense and suffering of others  is inconsistent with the work ethic of scripture  and tends to be habit forming  34  Homosexuality  The fellowship takes the position that the biblical ideal of marriage is between one man and one woman and that the Bible condemns all sex outside of marriage  whether heterosexual or homosexual  Furthermore  it emphasizes that  believers who struggle with homosexual temptations must be encouraged and strengthened by fellow Christians  and that believers  must hold no malice toward  or fear  of homosexuals  but  reach out in humility and compassion   see Christianity and homosexuality   35  Positive Confession  While the AG affirms that  All the blessings which God has for His people are received through faith   including salvation  Spirit baptism   divine preservation    healing and provision of material needs   and the motivation to witness   it rejects the teaching that faith or  positive confession   compels God s action   It holds that believers must consider the totality of scripture  consider adequately the will of God  recognize that they can expect suffering in life  and recognize the sovereignty of God  It also stresses the importance of persistent prayer  as opposed to simply confessing or  claiming  the promises of God  36  Women s role in ministry  The AG affirms the ministry of women in the church and allows them to be ordained and serve in pastoral roles  see Ordination of women   37   edit  Worship Worshipers at Phoenix First Assembly of God  an AG megachurch  See also  Contemporary worship Because of the congregational nature of the Assemblies of God  it is difficult to define a typical local church  Church identity is influenced by members  social class  ethnicity  and musical or worship style preferences  Margaret Poloma and John Green have categorized AG congregations into four types  traditional  evangelical  renewalist  and alternative  38  Traditional congregations are those which strongly identify with the AG  and Pentecostalism in general   while encouraging  more intense experiences of the charismata  or gifts of the Holy Spirit  such as Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues  Evangelical AG congregations  the most common type  identify with the AG and Pentecostalism but  are moving  in varying degrees  away from the unique experiences that were once important markers of Pentecostal identity   Renewalist or charismatic AG churches are those that encourage supernatural gifts of the Spirit but weakly identify with the AG or Pentecostalism  Alternative churches are those where both identity with the AG and occurrence of unique Pentecostal experiences are low  these include churches adopting seeker sensitive and emerging church models  Despite the diversity found in the AG  shared beliefs and values are reflected in local churches  The Assemblies of God is  experience oriented   and the local church is where experience of the activity of the Holy Spirit will primarily occur  39  Regular services are usually held on Sunday mornings and Sunday and Wednesday evenings  There is no formal liturgy or order of service  though  many churches have a familiar routine  opening prayer  congregational and special singing  an offering  a time of intercessory prayer  a sermon  and an altar call  In the traditional and charismatic AG churches  this routine is subject to change spontaneously within a service possibly being interrupted by an interpretation of a message in tongues  a prophecy  a word of wisdom  or a word of knowledge and this change is believed to be directed by the Holy Spirit  40  In addition  evening services may incorporate a time of prayer for those who are seeking something from God either around the altar or in an adjacent prayer room  During praise and worship  a believer s attitude of worship is often expressed through the raising of hands  Congregational singing is usually led by a choir or worship team  Full drum sets  a piano  an organ  and various other instruments are frequently used  The type of music sung is generally popular worship choruses  such as those by Calvary Chapel and Hillsong  but can also include urban gospel in some of the inner city or more progressive churches  Worship is often characterized as intense and enthusiastic  41  Prayer features prominently in services  Services may feature moments where special prayer is offered  often with laypersons leading the prayer and the rest of the congregation audibly participating  During these corporate prayers  some may pray in tongues  While not in every service  the pastor will pray for the sick  This prayer may include the pastor anointing the sick with olive oil and with the assistance of church elders along with pastoral associates laying hands on the one seeking healing  42  43  Architecturally  smaller churches will feature bright lighting  large windows  a simple platform with a pulpit in the center  and an altar   a bench across the front of the church below the platform    Larger churches will have direct access from the balcony to the main sanctuary near the platform so that respondents to altar calls can easily come forward  a large open area in front of the platform to accommodate altar call gatherings  and the platform itself is usually large to accommodate a large choir and musical instruments  Because the Assemblies of God practice baptism by immersion  many churches will include a baptistry at the rear of the platform  44   edit  Structure The Assemblies of God is defined in its constitution as a  cooperative fellowship  of  churches and credentialed ministers   45  It has a representative form of government derived from presbyterian polity and organized in three levels of administration  congregations  district councils and the General Council  46  The AG has  however  elements of congregational polity which are limited by the powers of the districts and General Council to license and discipline ordained ministers  1   edit  Congregations  edit  Self governing churches At the congregational level  churches affiliated with the General Council are  sovereign  and self governing  but in matters of doctrine local assemblies are subordinate to districts and the General Council  47  A church is qualified for General Council affiliation if it  accepts AG doctrines  adopts a standard of membership  has an active voting membership of at least 20 persons  adopts a governance model that prevents a pastor or governing body from  exert ing  dictatorial control over a church   has an adequate number of spiritually qualified members to fill the offices of the church  has made provision for a pastor who is a credentialed minister in good standing with the General Council  48  Each local church operates according to its own bylaws and calls its own pastor  The office of pastor is equivalent to that of elder or overseer and is tasked with preaching and teaching the Word of God  in addition to conducting the day to day operations of the church  46  49 Laypersons are elected as a board of deacons to assist the pastor  A General Council affiliated church may withdraw from the Assemblies of God by a two thirds vote of the church membership  50  At the request of the pastor  deacon board  or 20 percent of voting members  district officials may intervene in the internal affairs of a General Council affiliated church  If district leaders conclude that district supervision is warranted  the church will lose its status as a self governing church and revert to the status of  district affiliated assembly  until its problems are resolved  51  A church may also revert to district affiliated status if it no longer meets the minimum requirements for General Council membership  such as having less than 20 voting members  52   edit  Dependent and cooperative churches Local churches  sections  and district councils are able to establish new churches  53  A church plant may initially have district affiliation until it meets requirements for General Council affiliation  District affiliated churches are under the direct supervision of district officials but are encouraged to develop into fully self governing churches  In 2009  the General Council created a new category of affiliation called  parent affiliated churches   54  These are either church plants or campuses of a multi site church which are under the supervision of a General Council affiliated  parent  church  Existing Pentecostal churches which desire to affiliate with the General Council may request the status of  cooperating assembly  for a temporary term of four years before officially joining the denomination  55   edit  Districts Map of districts of the Assemblies of God in the United States Churches are organized into sections and sections into middle judicatories called districts  The 61 districts oversee  all the ecclesial and sacerdotal activities  within their jurisdiction  56  which includes recommending ministers for national credentialing and mediating disputes within local congregations  46  There are two types of districts  Geographical districts serve areas corresponding to state boundaries  while non geographical language or ethnic districts serve a particular language or ethnic group  such as Hispanic churches  46  Districts are governed by representative bodies called district councils which meet annually  District council membership includes all resident ministers and one lay delegate per AG church located within the district  When the district council is not in session  a district is led by a superintendent and a presbytery  board of directors  whose members are elected by and represent the sections  57  A presbyter  minister s  to ministers  and  model s  spiritual maturity and leadership  to the ministers and churches in his section  58   edit  General Council AG national headquarters in Springfield  Missouri At the top of this organizational framework is the biennial General Council  the highest governing body of the Assemblies of God  All ordained and licensed ministers and one delegate per Assembly of God church are entitled to attend and participate at the General Council  The size of General Council is not static but fluctuating  changing from year to year as there is no requirement that pastors attend or that churches send delegates  In general  however  there are over 3 000 voting members  59  General Council enacts legislation  credentials ministers  oversees the national and worldwide missions programs  and directs the church s colleges and seminary  46  The General Council also elects the general superintendent the chief executive officer of the national organization and other officers  such as the assistant general superintendent  general secretary  general treasurer  and the directors of U S  and world missions  These manage the AG s day to day operations and are the members of the Executive Leadership Team  In between General Council sessions  approximately 300 elected representatives from the various districts and foreign mission areas meet as the General Presbytery  60  The General Presbytery executes the policies established by the General Council and when it is not in session  the General Presbytery is the official policy making body of the Assemblies of God  61  62  A 20 member Executive Presbytery  led by the Executive Leadership Team  meets bimonthly and functions as the Assemblies of God s board of directors  61  Executive Presbyters are responsible to the General Presbytery and are ex officio members of that body   edit  General Superintendent Former AG General Superintendent Thomas Trask and wife  The office of General Superintendent was originally known as the Chairman of the General Council  until it was changed in 1927  The current General Superintendent of the General Council is Dr  George O  Wood  Wood s tenure began October 8  2007  when the previous General Superintendent  Dr  Thomas E  Trask stepped down after 14 years of leadership  The following is a list of General Superintendents and their tenures  63    Name Appointment Secession Time in 1 Eudorus N  Bell 1914

ordained  District councils examine candidates for all levels of ministry and recommend those qualified to the Executive Presbytery  which is the General Council s Credentials Committee  which has authority to issue ministerial credentials  64  The AG s constitution guarantees that  formal academic achievement  diploma or degree  shall not be a requirement for credentials   but the General Presbytery does mandate courses and examinations  In preparation for receiving credentials  applicants must either complete correspondence courses through Global University  the AG s distance education program   receive training through a postsecondary institution such as a college or seminary approved by the AG  or be recommended by a district credentials committee as qualifying for credentials based on self study and ministerial experience of  substantial duration   In addition  applicants must pass a standardized exam which tests them on their knowledge of the Bible  AG doctrines  and ministerial practices  After passing the exam  they are interviewed by their district s credentials committee  If judged qualified  the district will recommend the applicant to the General Council credentials committee  65  The Assemblies of God will not grant credentials to divorced and remarried persons if either partner has a former spouse living unless for specific exceptions  Exceptions include if the divorce occurred prior to an applicant s conversion or for  scriptural causes  such as a former spouse s marital unfaithfulness or the abandonment of a Christian by a non Christian partner  see Pauline privilege   66  The Executive Presbytery has authority to issue ecclesiastical annulments in cases involving conditions which prevent  the creation of a valid marriage union   such as fraud  67  Clergy are also barred from membership in secret societies  68  The Assemblies also recognize a  local church credential  which can be issued by a General Council affiliated church for those engaged only in local ministry  such as prison or hospital ministry  Local church credential holders may perform the ordinances of the church with the authorization of the issuing church s senior pastor  69  In 2008  there were a total of 34 178 Assemblies of God ministers  excluding local church credentials   Of these  11 544 were senior pastors and 6 730 were female  70   edit  Activities  edit  Missions A primary reason the General Council was formed in 1914 was to create cooperation in Pentecostal missionary work  Missions have remained a central focus of the denomination since that time  In 2009  there were Assemblies of God churches in 213 countries and territories around the world  Missionary work outside of the United States is overseen by Assemblies of God World Missions  As of December 2009  AG World Missions was reporting 2 719 personnel worldwide  71  The agency also provides medical evangelism through HealthCare Ministries  founded in 1983 as the Medical Missions Program  This ministry provides free optical  dental  and medical care as well as evangelism  72  It has operated in 86 countries since its founding  Missions in the United States

 located in Springfield  Missouri  which publishes books  curriculum  and church ministry resources primarily for Pentecostals and charismatics  but also for the general evangelical market  The Assemblies of God publishes an official weekly magazine  the Pentecostal Evangel  and Enrichment Journal  a resource for Pentecostal ministers  77  78   edit  Demographics First Assembly of God  West Monroe  Louisiana From its beginning in 1914  the Assemblies of God in the United States has experienced growth  In 1925  there were just 50 386 members in 909 churches  but by the early 1970s membership had reached 1 million  Its most rapid growth occurred from 1971 to 1984  when the AG grew from a constituency of around 1 million to 2 million over a 13 year period  79  In 2010  average Sunday morning worship attendance for all AG churches in the U S  was 1 886 785 people  4  In the same year  the AG s inclusive membership  includes persons of any age that identify with the AG  was 3 030 944 people attending 12 457 churches  That is an increase of 4 percent since 2009  80  The ethnic diversity of the American AG is increasing  however  its constituency is still largely white  From 1990 to 2000  there was a slight decline in white AG churches while ethnic churches  mainly Hispanic  were responsible for much of the denomination s numerical growth  81  In 2010  the AG reported 61 1 percent of its adherents as white  20 4 percent as Hispanic  9 1 percent as black  4 1 percent as Asian Pacific Islander  and 1 6 percent as Native American  The remaining 3 7 percent were listed as other mixed  82  The AG has created various non geographical language districts to serve immigrant communities whose primary language is not English  There are nine Spanish and two Korean language districts in addition to one each for Brazilian and German speakers  In 2009  the language districts oversaw 2 195 churches with a combined membership of 279 422  83  Members are fairly well distributed across the United States  California has the largest number of members  followed by Texas and Florida  84  However  the states with the highest membership rates are Oklahoma  Arkansas  Alaska  Montana  and Hawaii  84  Growing AG congregations tend to be located in suburban areas  as opposed to urban and rural ones  85   edit  History  edit  Origin E N  Bell  first General Superintendent of the AG The Assemblies of God has roots in the Pentecostal revival in the early 20th century  The Pentecostal aspects of the revival were not generally welcomed by the established churches  and participants in the movement soon found themselves outside existing religious bodies  86  They were forced to seek their own places of worship  and soon there were hundreds of distinctly Pentecostal congregations  After Charles Parham began promoting the idea that speaking in tongues was the initial evidence of the baptism in the Spirit around 1901  he began to attract a considerable following which he organized loosely as the Apostolic Faith Movement  AFM  in 1906  However with the rise of the Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles  California  and an accusation of sodomy against him in 1907  he lost and never recovered his influence  After renouncing Parham  the severely weakened AFM regrouped around Howard Goss  L  C  Hall  D  C  O  Opperman  and A  G  Canada  87  They were later joined by Eudorus N  Bell  previously a Southern Baptist minister  The AFM had its strength in the rural areas of Kansas  Texas  Arkansas  Oklahoma  and Missouri  In Pentecostalism s early years  organizational affiliation was fluid  and many ministers of the AFM  which was a white organization  were also licensed by Charles Harrison Mason s predominantly African American Church of God in Christ  88  In 1907  Goss had received a license to preach from Mason s group  and he claimed that Mason had given him permission to issue ministerial credentials under the Churches of God in Christ name for the  white work   By 1910  the name  Churches of God in Christ  was seen as a more biblical name and began to be preferred over  Apostolic Faith   87  The AFM played a leading role in organizing and institutionalizing Pentecostalism in the Midwest and Southwest and from 1909 1912 absorbed smaller Pentecostal groups  89  It also established relationships with Pentecostal missions in the Midwest  The Midwestern Pentecostal movement centered around the Stone Church  pastored by William Piper  and the North Avenue Mission  pastored by William Howard Durham  both in Chicago  Illinois  90  Durham was the lead promoter of the Finished Work doctrine which  in time  the AFM would adopt and in doing so discard the Wesleyan view of sanctification as a second work of grace  Between 1906 and 1908  the Pentecostal message had spread among Christian and Missionary Alliance  CMA  churches and conferences  At first  it was greeted positively by the CMA leadership  but the doctrine of initial evidence divided the organization  Former CMA Pentecostal congregations in the Midwest and Northeast were left without oversight and began associating with the Apostolic Faith Movement and the Chicago Pentecostal missions  91   edit  Early history  1914 1929   edit  General Council of 1914 By 1914  many white ministers nominally affiliated with the Church of God in Christ had become dissatisfied with the arrangement  92  AFM leaders Bell  Goss  Opperman  M  M  Pinson  and A  P  Collins issued the call for a general council to  Churches of God in Christ  and to all Pentecostal or Apostolic Faith Assemblies   What resulted was a merger of the AFM  Chicago  and CMA Pentecostals in 1914 at Hot Springs  Arkansas  91  The 1st General Council was attended by predominantly white representatives from 20 states and missions in Egypt and South Africa  93  The fellowship that emerged was incorporated as the General Council of the Assemblies of God  Bell was elected the first general superintendent  Five major reasons were given for calling the meeting  94  Create unity in doctrine and in identifying Pentecostal congregations  Develop ways to conserve the work at home and abroad  Develop a workable system for the support of missionaries  Charter local churches under  one Bible name   Discuss the possibility of a Bible training school  Other actions taken at the 1st General Council addressed women in ministry  The Pentecostals who founded the Assemblies of God had no objections to women being engaged in ministry  The Pentecostal belief in personal experience  Spirit baptism as empowerment for service  and the need for evangelists and missionaries encouraged women to be active in all types of ministry  What concerned some Pentecostal leaders  such as Bell  were women exercising independent authority over men  The council therefore approved of the granting of credentials to female evangelists and missionaries while restricting the office of pastor to men  and it was not until 1920 that female evangelists could vote at denominational meetings  By the fall of 1914  out of 512 credential holders  142 were female missionaries and evangelists  95  After 1914  the Church of God in Christ would become predominantly black and the Assemblies of God would remain predominantly white  However  there were African Americans involved in the early years of the Assemblies of God  The African American pastor Garfield Thomas Haywood  for example  pastored one of the largest churches and was an influential voice within the fellowship until he withdrew from the denomination after 1916  96   edit   New Issue  and doctrinal clarity The founders of the fellowship did not intend to create a denomination and originally had no creed or doctrinal statement  However in response to several doctrinal issues  the most important being the Oneness teaching  the AG felt the need for agreement on central doctrines and to reassure evangelical Christians of its adherence to orthodox belief  97 Oneness Pentecostalism rejected Trinitarian theology  instead identifying the Jehovah of the Old Testament with the Christ of the New  Furthermore  Oneness adherents believed that Christians  regardless of a previous baptism  should be baptized in the name of Jesus  rather than in the name of the Trinity  By 1915  it was adhered to by many in the fellowship  including founders such as Goss  Opperman  Hall  and Henry G  Rodgers  98  Other influential leaders  such as G  T  Haywood  adopted the Oneness doctrine as well  In 1916  the 4th General Council met in St  Louis to resolve the  new issue   In a move that caused not a little anxiety  a committee introduced the Statement of Fundamental Truths  Oneness proponents and others saw this as an attack on the authority of the Bible  yet it was adopted along with a recommendation that AG ministers use the Trinitarian baptismal formula  Old preaching credentials were recalled and new ones issued with the Fundamental Truths included  Oneness believers  including a third of the fellowship s ministers  99  were forced to withdraw  a loss especially felt in the South where the Oneness doctrine had the most influence  A side effect of this was a transition in leadership from former Apostolic Faith leaders  many of whom accepted the Oneness teaching  to men with Christian and Missionary Alliance backgrounds  98  The Oneness dissenters formed the General Assembly of the Apostolic Churches  which later merged with another group to form the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World  100  Among the Fundamental Truths was a statement regarding speaking in tongues as the initial physical evidence of Spirit baptism  Its inclusion was challenged by F F  Bosworth  an executive presbyter  who argued that while for many speaking in tongues was an evidence of the baptism it was not the only evidence  The issue was decided at the General Council of September 1918 where Bosworth  who two months earlier had resigned so as not to damage the fellowship  was present and invited to address the council  Following debate two resolutions were passed which assured that initial evidence would remain an official teaching of the fellowship  101  While doctrinal controversy led to the withdrawal of ministers  the fellowship experienced growth in subsequent years  District councils were organized in various regions of the country and  where these did not exist  home missionary fields were designated to maximize evangelistic efforts  District councils and missionary stations were established outside the U S  also  By 1921  there were districts in Canada  see Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada   China  Japan  see Japan Assemblies of God   India  see Assemblies of God in India   and Egypt  102 Central Bible College was started in the basement of the Central Assembly of God church in Springfield  Missouri  in 1922  103  In 1929  the fellowship claimed 91 981 members in 1 612 churches  104   edit  1930 1979  edit  Women and ethnic minorities Day school of Evangel Hispanic Church  an AG church in Elizabeth  New Jersey Despite Pentecostalism s origins in a racially inclusive revival  it accommodated itself to America s culture of racial segregation rather early  The Assemblies of God was no different  As early as 1915  an executive presbyter wrote in an article for the Pentecostal Evangel that segregation was  ordained of God   however  it was not until 1939 that the General Presbytery enacted a policy prohibiting the ordination of African Americans to the ministry  105  Districts were still allowed to license African Americans to preach but only in the district where the license was issued  Black Pentecostals seeking ordination were referred to  one of the colored organizations   This was especially true of the Church of God in Christ  which  despite the fact that it predates the Assemblies of God  was seen as a  younger sibling   It was not until 1962  under the leadership of General Superintendent Thomas F  Zimmerman  that the denomination finally began issuing ordinations without regard to race  106  Three years later the 1965 General Council adopted a resolution affirming civil rights and condemning racism and discrimination  107  By the 1970s  there was renewed focus on inner city evangelism and integrated urban efforts  While blacks were excluded from the AG until the 1960s  the denomination s work among Spanish speaking people has a long history  first sanctioned explicitly in 1918  Hispanic outreach became independent of the Foreign Missions Department in 1929 when the first Latin American District was established  By the end of World War II  the AG s Latin American constituency formed the largest Protestant presence among Hispanics in the United States  108  The AG also focused on major European immigrant populations  but as later generations assimilated into American culture  these separate European segments were absorbed into the regular geographic districts  During the time when African Americans were barred from ordination  women began to receive greater opportunities for leadership  Women formed an important part of the Assemblies of God s constituency  many being Sunday School workers and evangelists  most prominent being Aimee Semple McPherson  who would later found the Foursquare Church   This made the issue of women s place in the movement important in the 1930s  109  It was also recognized that many congregations who could not afford male pastors relied on women preachers  Despite the fact that opposition to female pastors had been regularly affirmed since 1914  the office of pastor was opened to women in 1935  110   edit  Relations with other denominations and renewal movements Between the World Wars  the movement kept a relative isolation from other Pentecostal and evangelical groups  but after World War II  the AG started an approximation with Pentecostal groups overseas  Like the Federation of Pentecostal Churches in Germany and the Assemblies of God in Australia  at that time many national denominations came to affiliate with the U S  fellowship  These partnerships would later develop into the World Assemblies of God Fellowship  As well as establishing fellowships in other nations  the AG also began to communicate with other U S  churches  The Assemblies of God was a founding member of both the National Association of Evangelicals and the Pentecostal Fellowship of North America  now Pentecostal Charismatic Churches of North America   111  In the 1950s  the AG was challenged by the Latter Rain Movement  which began among former members of the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada  the AG s Canadian counterpart  and quickly spread to the United States  The  New Order  as it was known was highly critical of denominations  such as the AG  and taught that the gifts of the Spirit are channeled through church elders and are given to others by the laying on of hands  However  the Assemblies of God and other classical Pentecostal groups maintained that the charismata are not personally received or imparted but are manifested as the Holy Spirit wills  112  In 1949 with a meeting of the General Council approaching  there were fears that the fellowship might split over the Latter Rain issue  but in the end  the General Council was united against what were seen as the excesses of the movement  A General Council resolution specified six errors which included  imparting  identifying  bestowing  or confirming gifts by prophecy and the laying on of hands  It also rejected the idea that the Church is built on present day apostles and prophets  The Latter Rain theology of no pre tribulation rapture and the manifested sons of God teaching were condemned as heresy  113  114  The Latter Rain and the Salvation Healing Revival of the late 1940s and 50s would be a major influence on later renewal movements  The affiliation of the Assemblies of God with the National Association of Evangelicals in 1942 signaled the AG s alignment with evangelicalism and its opposition to mainline Protestantism and the ecumenical movement  The AG and its evangelical partners agreed on most issues and shared similar world views though the AG s Pentecostal distinctives Spirit baptism and the operation of spiritual gifts were not embraced by most evangelical Christians  The AG s response then to the charismatic movement that began in the 1960s was a cautious one  affirming the move of the Holy Spirit yet urging that all revival must be judged by scripture  For the first time  beliefs and practices which had largely remained confined to the classical Pentecostal denominations began to impact mainline Protestant and Roman Catholic churches on a large scale  The fact that this occurred in these churches  which were historically seen by Pentecostals as suspect   the multifaceted nature of the movement owing to the many different traditions its participants came from  and the perception by Pentecostals that the movement was based too much on experience and not on biblical teaching led some in the Assemblies of God to see it in relation to the ecumenical movement  115  The charismatic movement forced a reevaluation of what it was to be Pentecostal  The Assemblies of God understood Spirit baptism in the context of baptistic evangelical theology and  by the 1950s  emphasized certain doctrines and practices as requisite for Spirit baptism  Charismatics challenged these views by claiming to receive Holy Spirit baptism outside of this context  such as remaining in liturgical churches  failing to reject sacramental theologies  and not adopting Pentecostal taboos on dancing  drinking  smoking  etc    116  On the local level  Assemblies of God churches were influenced by the charismatic movement  Some charismatics left their original churches and joined less formal Assemblies of God congregations  In addition  the contemporary decreased emphasis on traditional Pentecostal taboos in the AG is in part attributable to the charismatic movement  which accelerated a trend already in existence  117   edit  Changing views on behavior  war and pacifism Since their movement s emergence early in the 20th century  Pentecostals saw themselves as  peculiar people   and one of the components of this identity were particular prohibitions on behavior  Prohibitions on drug use  gambling  social dancing  consuming alcohol  smoking  attending theaters  bowling  swimming in public pools and beaches  owning television sets  and restrictions on feminine attire and fashion helped distinguish Pentecostals from the larger society  117  118  Starting in the 1950s  attitudes in the Assemblies of God on many of these activities underwent dramatic change  The most change probably occurred over views on women s attire  with the former stance against wearing make up and jewelry giving way to the acceptance of popular fashion  Most of these  holiness standards  are no longer adhered to  however  some are still held to  such as proscriptions on smoking  alcohol and drug use  118  For much of its history  the Assemblies of God officially opposed Christian participation in war 119  and was listed by The Pacifist Handbook as America s third largest peace church in 1940  The official position of the church until 1967 encouraged Christian nonviolence   We       are nevertheless constrained to declare we cannot conscientiously participate in war and armed resistance which involves the actual destruction of human life  since this is contrary to our view of the clear teachings of the inspired Word of God   120  Most of the founders and first generation members of the denomination held to this view  and it was presented as official teaching throughout World War I and World War II  The official pacifist position remained unchanged until 1967 when the denomination affirmed  the right of each member to choose whether to declare their position as a combatant  a noncombatant  or a conscientious objector   121  This was the culmination of a process begun during World War I  when it was unpopular to hold antiwar views  in which AG adherents questioned their denomination s pacifist stance  122   edit  Recent history  1980 present  The Assemblies of God emerged as the leading Pentecostal denomination in terms of status  wealth  influence  and global adherence  123  In the 1980s  the Assemblies of God saw rapid growth in the US  for several years ranking as the fastest growing American denomination  This growth was mainly the result of its Hispanic outreach  in 1988 Hispanic members made up some 15 percent of the fellowship s total constituency   124  The growth of an Asian immigrant constituency was also recognized in this decade when the first Korean district was created  The Assemblies of God gained national visibility in the late 1980s from the popularity and later scandals surrounding two of its ministers  Jimmy Swaggert and Jim Bakker  125  The Assemblies of God launched an effort to increase evangelism and growth in the 1990s called the  Decade of Harvest   Such efforts failed to sustain the impressive growth of the 1980s  however  From 2003 to 2008  growth had slowed to an average annual increase of just over 1 percent  123  With increased growth came increased acceptance and acculturation  Since the  80s  a growing number of AG ministers have been educated and risen to leadership positions at evangelical institutions  such as Fuller Theological Seminary  Gordon Conwell  and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School  123  This  evangelicalization of the Assemblies of God  has led to the weakening of Pentecostal distinctives  especially the doctrine of initial evidence  126  Other traditional practices  such as holding prayer meetings and altar services  have faded over time as well  Despite the efforts of denominational leaders to reassert Pentecostal identity and remain more than  evangelicals plus tongues   the process of acculturation has continued  123  Even so  churches within the Assemblies of God have experienced revivals in the last two decades which featured worship and practices reminiscent of early Pentecostalism  The most prominent of these was the Brownsville Revival  which occurred at the Brownsville Assembly of God in Pensacola  Florida  from 1995 into the early 2000s  These revivals often faced criticism from within and without the Assemblies of God for their unpredictability and the dramatic religious experiences of participants  In the case of the Brownsville Revival  the AG s national leadership gave it cautious approval and support  127   edit  See also List of Assemblies of God people Megachurches affiliated with the Assemblies of God
