Liverpool  Lancashire  England  the son of Elsie  n e Gleave  and Richard Starkey  a confectioner  3  4  5  6  His paternal grandfather was born with the surname  Parkin   and later adopted his stepfather s surname   Starkey   7  Starr s parents split up when he was three years old  8  and his mother subsequently married Harry Graves  9  who encouraged his interest in music  8  9  10  Starr s family moved when he was three years old to a smaller home at 10 Admiral Grove  Starr attended an Evangelical Anglican church during his childhood  11  He was afflicted by illness for much of his early years  When aged six  he had appendicitis  which developed complications  causing him to fall into a coma  12  At thirteen  he developed chronic pleurisy and was admitted to a sanatorium for two years  13  After this extended hospital visit he did not return to school  9  14  The periods of hospitalisation left him behind scholastically  and as a result he was ineligible to attend a grammar school or even sit its Eleven plus qualifying examination  15  Earlier  Starr attended St Silas  a Church of England primary school in High Park Street  close to his home in Admiral Grove  16  singer Billy Fury attended the school at the same time  Later  Starr attended Dingle Vale Secondary Modern School  now Shorefields Technology College   leaving in 1955  17  While there  he showed an aptitude for art and drama as well as practical subjects including mechanics  15  Starr s health problems had another enduring effect in the form of allergies and sensitivities to food  and when the Beatles travelled to India in 1968  he took his own food with him  18  Like John Lennon  Paul McCartney and George Harrison  Starr became caught up in Liverpool s skiffle craze  19  In 1957  he and his friend Eddie Miles formed the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group  20  In 1959  he joined the Raving Texans  21  now adopting the stage name  Ringo Starr  because of the rings he wore 22  and because it sounded  cowboyish   and his drum solos were billed as  Starr Time   23  By October 1960  the band was renamed Rory Storm and the Hurricanes  and while they were performing in Hamburg  Starr met the Beatles  24  25  On 16 October 1960 he drummed in Hamburg with Lennon  McCartney and Harrison  recording with them for the first time to back Hurricanes  singer Lu Walters  26  After returning to the UK  Starr sat in for Pete Best as the Beatles  drummer on 18 August 1961 and 5 February 1962  27  The Beatles removed Best as their drummer on 16 August 1962  after Best had played in the early recording sessions at EMI Studios  Starr s first performance as a full Beatle was on 18 August 1962 at a Horticultural Society dance at Port Sunlight  27  28  After his appearance at the Cavern Club performance as a full Beatle the following day  Best s fans were upset at his sacking  holding vigils outside Best s house and fighting at the club  shouting  Pete forever  Ringo never   27  29  George Harrison received a black eye from one of the fans  30  When he arrived at EMI Studios for the second time on 11 September  Starr was shocked to find another drummer there  session drummer Andy White who was commissioned by producer George Martin  Using sessions drummers familiar with studio techniques was a normal procedure for studio recordings in those days  Starr s view at the time was that Andy White was brought in because he thought George Martin viewed him as crazy  Of the 4 September rehearsal session  Starr stated   He  George Martin  thought I was crazy and couldn t play  Because when we were doing  Please Please Me   I was actually playing the kit and in one hand I had a tambourine and a maracas in the other  because I was trying to play the percussion and the drums at the same time  because we were just a four piece band   31  Starr also stated   I thought   That s the end  they re doing a Pete Best on me    32   edit  The Beatles  1962 1970 Main article  The Beatles Ringo Starr  bottom right  with John Lennon  top left   Paul McCartney  top right  and George Harrison  bottom left   arriving in New York City in 1964  edit  Vocals Starr generally sang at least one song on each studio album as part of an attempt to establish the vocal personality of all four members  In some cases  Lennon or McCartney wrote the lyrics and melody especially for him  as they did for  Yellow Submarine  from Revolver and  With a Little Help from My Friends  on Sgt  Pepper s Lonely Hearts Club Band  33  These melodies were tailored to Starr s baritone vocal range  Starr s backing vocals are heard on songs such as  Carry That Weight   34  and  The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill   35   edit  Composition The Beatles used Starr s unusual turns of phrase  or  Ringoisms  as they became known  such as  a hard day s night  and  tomorrow never knows   and turned them into songs  36  Recalling this  McCartney said   Ringo would do these little malapropisms  he would say things slightly wrong  like people do  but his were always wonderful  very lyrical    they were sort of magic   37  As well as inspiring his bandmates  creativity in this way  Starr occasionally contributed his own lyrics to unfinished Lennon and McCartney songs  such as the line  darning his socks in the night when there s nobody there  in  Eleanor Rigby   38  Frustrated at times of being the odd man out in the group in regard to songwriting  Starr commented in The Beatles Anthology that when he presented a song to the Beatles  it would often sound to the other three Beatles like a popular song of the day  Starr did eventually begin composing  and is credited with  Don t Pass Me By   on The White Album  39  40  and  Octopus s Garden   on Abbey Road  41  42  as sole songwriter  His disgust with the band s tensions and boredom at waiting around to contribute during the sessions for the White Album caused him to quit the group temporarily  He spent two weeks with actor Peter Sellers on the latter s yacht  Amelfis  in Piraeus  where he wrote  Octopus s Garden   43  He did not return for two weeks  even though the other Beatles urged him to come back  Lennon sent telegrams  and Harrison set up flowers all over the studio for Starr s return saying  Welcome home   44  Starr s name also appears as a co writer for the Rubber Soul track  What Goes On  along with Lennon and McCartney  45  while the songs  Flying   on the Magical Mystery Tour album  46  and  Dig It   on Let It Be  47  are listed as being written by the entire group  On issued material after the break up  Starr wrote  Taking a Trip to Carolina  from the second  bonus  CD of Let It Be    Naked  and received joint songwriting credits with the other three Beatles for  12 Bar Original    Los Paranoias    Christmas Time  Is Here Again     Suzy Parker   heard in the Let It Be film    Jessie s Dream   heard in the Magical Mystery Tour film  and The Beatles  version of  Free as a Bird    edit  1964 illness McCartney  Harrison  Lennon and Jimmie Nicol in the Netherlands on 5 June 1964 In June 1964  the Beatles were scheduled to tour Denmark  the Netherlands  Asia  Australia and New Zealand  48  On 3 June  the day before the tour  Starr collapsed during an early morning photo session for the Saturday Evening Post at a portrait studio in Barnes  London  Stricken with a 102 degree fever and tonsillitis  he was rushed to the hospital  This bout with tonsillitis necessitated a stay in hospital and a few days of recuperation at home  During this time  Starr was temporarily replaced for the Sweden  Denmark  the Netherlands  Hong Kong and Adelaide concert dates by 24 year old session drummer Jimmie Nicol  Beatles producer George Martin suggested Nicol because he had recently recorded at EMI with Tommy Quickly and recently became familiar with Beatles numbers while drumming on a recording session for an album called Beatlemania  At first  Harrison did not want Starr replaced and refused to go on the tour without Starr  but Brian Epstein and George Martin convinced Harrison to begin the tour  Starr was discharged from the hospital on 11 June  and he rejoined the group in Melbourne on 15 June 1964  Ultimately  Starr had his tonsils removed during the Beatles  Christmas holiday period later in the year  Starr later admitted that he feared that he would be permanently replaced during his illness   edit  Drumming skills While Starr himself has been the first to acknowledge the technical limitations of his drumming for the Beatles  the overall effect of his contribution has received high praise from notable drummers  Starr said   Whenever I hear another drummer I know I m no good  I m no good on the technical things       I m your basic offbeat drummer with funny fills  The fills were funny because I m really left handed playing a right handed kit  I can t roll around the drums because of that   1  Martin s version was   Ringo hit good and hard and used the tom tom well  even though he couldn t do a roll to save his life   although Martin later added   He s got tremendous feel  He always helped us to hit the right tempo for a song  and gave it that support   that rock solid back beat   that made the recording of all The Beatles  songs that much easier   1  In 1968  49  Martin praised Starr s drumming on Sgt  Pepper  calling him  probably     the finest rock drummer in the world today   50  Lennon  when asked if Starr was the best drummer in the world  jokingly replied   He s not even the best drummer in the Beatles   51   on account of McCartney filling in for Starr on drums on several songs  such as  Back in the USSR    Dear Prudence  and  Martha My Dear    but also said   Ringo s a damn good drummer  He always was a good drummer  He s not technically good  but I think Ringo s drumming is underrated the same way as Paul s bass playing is underrated   1  McCartney sent Starr a postcard on 31 January 1969  the day after the band s performance on the roof of Apple Studios   stating   You are the greatest drummer in the world  Really   This postcard is included in Starr s book Postcards from the Boys  52  Drummer Steve Smith extolled Starr s qualities beyond the technical  in terms of his musical contribution as drummer    Before Ringo  drum stars were measured by their soloing ability and virtuosity  Ringo s popularity brought forth a new paradigm in how the public saw drummers  We started to see the drummer as an equal participant in the compositional aspect  One of Ringo s great qualities was that he composed unique  stylistic drum parts for the Beatles  songs  His parts are so signature to the songs that you can listen to a Ringo drum part without the rest of the music and still identify the song  2    Phil Collins  the drummer for Genesis  who was himself influenced by Starr  citation needed  said    Starr is vastly underrated  The drum fills on the song  A Day in the Life  are very complex things  You could take a great drummer today and say   I want it like that   He wouldn t know what to do  53  54    In September 1980  John Lennon had this to say about Starr    Ringo was a star in his own right in Liverpool before we even met  He was a professional drummer who sang and performed and had Ringo Starr time and he was in one of the top groups in Britain but especially in Liverpool before we even had a drummer  So Ringo s talent would have come out one way or the other as something or other  I don t know what he would have ended up as  but whatever that spark is in Ringo that we all know but can t put our finger on   whether it is acting  drumming or singing I don t know   there is something in him that is projectable and he would have surfaced with or without the Beatles  Ringo is a damn good drummer  55    Many drummers acknowledge Starr as an influence  including Steve Gorman of the Black Crowes  Dave Grohl of Nirvana  Jen Ledger of Skillet  Max Weinberg of the E Street Band  Danny Carey of Tool  Liberty DeVitto of Billy Joel s band  Nicko McBrain of Iron Maiden  Eric Carr of Kiss  Phil Rudd of AC DC  Orri P ll D rason of Sigur R s  56  the former Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy  Pedro Andreu of Heroes del Silencio and others  54  In his extensive survey of the Beatles  recording sessions  Mark Lewisohn confirmed that Starr was both proficient and remarkably reliable and consistent  According to Lewisohn  there were fewer than a dozen occasions in the Beatles  eight year recording career where session  breakdowns  were caused by Starr making a mistake  while the vast majority of takes were stopped owing to mistakes by the other three members  54  Starr is considered to have influenced various modern drumming techniques  such as the matched grip  placing the drums on high risers for visibility as part of the band  tuning the drums lower  and using muffling devices on tonal rings  2  For the band s second recording session with Starr as a member on 11 September 1962  producer George Martin replaced the studio inexperienced Starr with session drummer Andy White to record takes for what would be the two sides of the Beatles  first single   Love Me Do  backed with  P S  I Love You   57  Starr played tambourine on  Love Me Do  and maracas on  P S  I Love You  for this session  58  McCartney took over the drums on  Back in the U S S R   and  Dear Prudence  from the White Album  1968  after Starr had walked out  59  and also played the drums on  The Ballad of John and Yoko   recorded on 14 April 1969  since only he and Lennon were immediately available to record the song  60  Starr commented that he was lucky in being  surrounded by three frustrated drummers  who could only drum in one style  61   edit  After the Beatles  edit  1970s Ringo drumming with Bob Dylan and the Band After the announcement of the break up of the Beatles on 10 April 1970  Starr released two albums before the end of that year  Sentimental Journey featured Starr s renditions of many pre rock standards and included the arranger talents of Quincy Jones  Maurice Gibb  George Martin and McCartney  among others  His next album  Beaucoups of Blues  put Starr in a country context  and included renowned Nashville session musician Pete Drake  He scored hit singles with  It Don t Come Easy   1971   U S  No 4  and  Back Off Boogaloo   1972   U S  No 9   the latter of which was his biggest UK hit  peaking at No 2  He achieved two No 1 hits in the U S   with  Photograph   co written with Harrison  and  You re Sixteen   written by the Sherman Brothers of Mary Poppins fame   He participated in the Concert for Bangladesh organised by Harrison in 1971  as well as drumming on Harrison s All Things Must Pass and Living in the Material World  Lennon s John Lennon Plastic Ono Band  and Yoko Ono s early solo work  Starr then made his debut as a film director with the T  Rex documentary Born to Boogie  Starr became firm friends with T  Rex frontman Marc Bolan and during the period of filming the documentary  Starr released the single  Back Off Boogaloo   62  In 1971  he started a furniture company with designer Robin Cruikshank  Starr s own avant garde designs included a flower shaped table with adjustable petal seats and a donut shaped fireplace  63  The 1973 album Ringo  produced by Richard Perry  with participation by the other three former Beatles on different tracks  was commercially successful  The album Goodnight Vienna followed the next year and was also successful  Hits and notable tracks from these two albums included  Photograph  and  You re Sixteen  both reaching number one on the US charts   Oh My My   US No 5  and  I m the Greatest   written by Lennon  from Ringo  and  Only You  And You Alone    US No 6  and  No No Song   US No 3  from 1974 s Goodnight Vienna  In late 1975  these singles and others were collected for Starr s first greatest hits compilation  Blast from Your Past  which was the last album released on Apple Records  64  During this period he became romantically involved with Lynsey de Paul  65  He played tambourine on a song she wrote and produced for Vera Lynn   Don t You Remember When   and he inspired another De Paul song   If I Don t Get You the Next One Will   which she described as being about revenge after he missed a dinner appointment with her because he was asleep in his office  65  Starr s recording career subsequently diminished in commercial impact  although he continued to record and remained a familiar celebrity presence  Starr signed with Atlantic Records in the mid 1970s  and in 1976 the album Ringo s Rotogravure was released  Although yielding two minor hit singles   A Dose of Rock  n  Roll   US No 26  and a cover of  Hey  Baby   US No 74  the album achieved moderate sales but reached a respectable No 28  This caused the label to revamp Starr s formula  the results were a curious blend of disco and 1970s pop  The album Ringo the 4th  1977  was a commercial disaster  reaching no higher than No 162 on the charts  Afterward  Starr soon signed with Portrait Records  His stint with Portrait began on a promising note  1978 saw the release of Bad Boy  as well as a network TV special  However  neither were very popular  with Bad Boy reaching a disappointing No 129 on the US charts  Consequently  Starr did not release another album with Portrait Records  66  In 1975  Starr founded his own record label called Ring O Records  and four albums were released on the label between 1975 and 1978  Startling Music by David Hentschel  Graham Bonnet by Graham Bonnet

and back up vocals  Starr was interviewed by Rolling Stone and Musician around this time  Stop and Smell the Roses was a well regarded album  but again did not sell particularly well  During recording of  Stop and Smell the Roses   Lennon had offered Starr a pair of songs to use on Roses   Nobody Told Me  and  Life Begins at 40   However  following Lennon s murder  Starr did not feel comfortable recording them  the former was released posthumously under Lennon s name on the album Milk and Honey  while the latter s painfully ironic lyrics kept it unissued until 1998 s John Lennon Anthology

Tank Engine  amp  Friends  a Britt Allcroft production  which was first shown on Central Television and subsequently across the ITV network  He was unsure about taking the role at first  having never previously read the books by Reverend Awdry  and at the time he felt that children would be more interested in  dinosaurs with lasers   Nevertheless  he had a change of heart and took the role
