television science fiction Science fiction has been a popular genre with television viewers in the United States almost since mass media broadcasting s inception  The first popular science fiction program on American television was the children s adventure serial Captain Video and His Video Rangers  which ran from June 1949 to April 1955  1  Within eight months of Captain Video s debut  two other landmark series were launched   Tom Corbett  Space Cadet  8 50   6 55  and Space Patrol  3 50   2 55   ABC attempted to cash in on the burgeoning television science fiction market with a small screen version of Buck Rogers in 1950  but failed within months  Another series of the fiftes  Rod Brown of the Rocket Rangers disappeared within weeks of debut  Other children s series of note in the fifties would be Captain Z Ro which was broadcast starting in 1951  Rocky Jones  Space Ranger  and Flash Gordon  1954 TV series  syndicated in 1954  The first science fiction show for adults  was also its first fully science fictional anthology Tales of Tomorrow by ABC on August 3  1951 lasting until 1953  as there were already similar shows for children  2  This was followed two months later by Out There on CBS only lasting twelve episodes  3 Science Fiction Theatre was another early anthology series  running from 1955 and 1957  It was followed by The Twilight Zone in 1959 and The Outer Limits in 1963  The mid sixties brought a resurgence of episodic science fiction to the airwaves  mostly thanks to producer Irwin Allen  In 1964  he launched Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea  TV series   based on his 1961 film of the same name  The series ran for four seasons  His next series Lost in Space  a space opera which aired from 1965 to 1968  became popular with audiences  and quickly led to two other sci fi favorites in 1966  Time Tunnel and Land of the Giants  Next came the unexpected sleeping juggernaut  Star Trek  conceived by Gene Roddenberry  and aired on NBC  When NBC tried to cancel it in early 1968  the show was so popular among fans that a campaign organized by Bjo Trimble successfully demanded its return  redefining the relationship between television networks and audiences  However  the eventual cancellation of Star Trek led to a decline in science fiction on American television  During the late 1970s  Star Wars reignited interest in science fiction  This led to the production of shows including Buck Rogers in the 25th Century and Battlestar Galactica  1978 1980   In 1983  the miniseries V used both Cold War and World War II allegories about totalitarianism  propaganda  collaboration  and resistance  In 1987  enduring fan interest  partially preserved by the first four installments of the Star Trek film franchise from 1979 to 1986  those films  popularity led to the development of the Star Trek sequel Star Trek  The Next Generation  which became extremely successful  and led to the later sequels Star Trek  Deep Space Nine  Star Trek  Voyager  and finally Star Trek  Enterprise  which ended in 2005  In 1993  seaQuest DSV explored environmental themes  In the same year  Babylon 5 began  set in a detailed universe  using a multi threaded multi level story arc  Although ratings were weak among general audiences  Babylon 5 had strong support within science fiction fandom  It raised the bar expected by audiences and led to a broad increase in the quality of science fiction on television in the late 1990s  The time travel drama Quantum Leap used contemporary settings to find a broader audience  The X Files tapped into popular conspiracy fears and generational angst to find great commercial success throughout the decade  Shows with fantasy and horror elements drew much influence from The X Files  and generally attracted large audiences  most notably Buffy the Vampire Slayer  and spinoff Angel   Its influence on the sci fi genre was still greatly felt throughout the first decade of the 21st century  Near the end of the decade  some comic science fiction shows were popular  3rd Rock from the Sun  and the animated series Futurama  In the 21st century  shows with paranormal themes like Medium and Ghost Whisperer had appeared on mainstream networks  Many shows popular with American audiences are now produced outside the US  including Stargate SG 1 and Battlestar Galactica  In recent years  the much lower costs of reality television shows have hit all television dramas  but especially those with unusual cost requirements such as science fiction shows  This has led to a sharp decline in production since 2003  though shows like the 2004 reimagined Battlestar Galactica series  NBC s Heroes  and ABC s Lost attracted strong audiences  First run syndication was the most important venue for science fiction television between the mid 1980s and mid 1990s  After this period  specialty channels such as Syfy have replaced first run syndication as a significant venue for new shows  Prior to recent years  science fiction television shows were normally centered around a premise and characters were defined essentially based on what they did or encountered in the course of their adventures  However  the growing trend  or  paradigm shift   towards character centered drama and naturalistic plots and settings has replaced the episodic action adventure format that was once standard for television science fiction  Cosmic themes  metaphysics  sense of wonder  exotic settings  technobabble  so called Big Dumb Objects  psychedelic imagery  and  two fisted action  have been mostly phased out in favor of human content  contemporary themes  and strong focus on character relationships  Also  the demographic audience for science fiction has changed from mostly male to a significant female presence demanding more human elements and stronger female character representation  citation needed  The aforementioned reimagined Battlestar Galactica is one of the most noted examples of the naturalistic approach towards television science fiction  Although television science fiction has always frequently addressed moral and social themes  recent series have done so with less subtlety and with more blatantly political themes  The anthology series format popularized by Rod Serling rarely appeared in science fiction television after the 1980s  though aspects of this were used in both The X Files and the 90s reincarnation of The Outer Limits  The current format  which was unintentionally popularized by Chris Carter of The X Files  is toward long story arcs and season long plots with character oriented subplots  At one time  prominent science fiction authors were frequently recruited to write episodes of various series  such as William Gibson s and Stephen King s work on The X Files  Other writers include Larry Niven who wrote for Land of the Lost  The last major involvement of a science fiction writer was Harlan Ellison who served as a creative consultant on Babylon 5  This has also largely disappeared due in part to the logistics of writing for television and the reality of proper television drama taking precedence over good science fiction   edit  British television science fiction Main article  British television science fiction The first known piece of television science fiction anywhere in the world was produced by the BBC on February 11  1938  a thirty five minute adaptation of a section of the play R U R   4  In the summer of 1953  BBC staff writer Nigel Kneale created The Quatermass Experiment  the first of several Quatermass serials  In the 1960s  Britain s independent television network  ITV  influenced by Canadian producer Sydney Newman produced the science fiction serials Pathfinders In Space  1960  and its sequel Pathfinders to Venus  1961   In 1961  the BBC produced A for Andromeda about a supercomputer artificial intelligence created from instructions received from an alien transmission  In 1963  the BBC began production of the longest running science fiction television series ever  Doctor Who  about a time travelling alien called the Doctor  Lasting for twenty six seasons in its original form  it was successfully revived from 2005  now having 33 seasons  Doctor Who alumni moved on to create their own science fiction programmes  such as Doomwatch  1970 73   Survivors  1975 77   and Blake s 7  1978 81   Gerry Anderson made science fiction series for ITV using the puppet based  Supermarionation  technique including Fireball XL5  1962 63   Thunderbirds  1965 66   Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons  1967 amp 68   and Stingray  1964 65  which all retain a following  Later he was able to develop live action shows such as UFO  1970  and Space  1999  1975 77   A similar puppet based series to the Anderson ones was Space Patrol  1962 64   produced by Roberta Leigh and made with the Associated British Corporation  ABC   Other popular shows created during the sixties that have achieved cult status included a tendency to look at the secret service for inspiration  Popular examples include the allegory Orwellian series The Prisoner  The Avengers and Randall and Hopkirk  Deceased   all produced for ITV  ITV produced youth oriented genre programmes during the 1970s  such as Timeslip  1970 71   The Tomorrow People  1973 79   and Children of the Stones  1977   as well as shows aimed at a wider audience such as the time travel drama Sapphire  amp  Steel  1979 82   Meanwhile  the BBC adapted The Changes  1975   which featured the quest of a teenage girl  Nicky Gore  to discover the cause of the shift back to the pre industrial and pre technological age  and bring it to an end  The BBC adapted novels such as The Day of the Triffids  1981   The Invisible Man  1984   The Nightmare Man  1981  from the novel Child of the Vodyanoi  and The Tripods  1984 85   which however remained unfinished  The BBC also aired science fiction comedy series such as The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  1981  by Douglas Adams and Red Dwarf  1988 99  2009   Doctor Who was finally cancelled in 1989  not to return as a regular television series until 2005  The BBC also produced several children s science fiction shows in the late 1990s to mid 2000 s  The most known examples of which being Aquila  TV series   1997 1998  based on the novel by Andrew Norriss and Jeopardy  BBC TV series   2002 2004  which won the 2002 BAFTA for Best Children s Drama  Russell T Davies  responsible for the latest Doctor Who revival in its earlier seasons  began working in the BBC children s department in the 1990s  His first science fiction serial was Dark Season  two years later he wrote Century Falls  The BBC also produced the action adventure series Bugs  and co produced Invasion  Earth with the US Sci Fi Channel  The new Doctor Who has spun off two series  Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures  Other 21st century British science fiction shows have included the time travel drama Life on Mars  its sequel Ashes to Ashes  Being Human and Eleventh Hour and Primeval on ITV  At end of the first decade of the 21st Century  current series included Misfits  a show about a group of misfit teenagers who get superpowers and Paradox  a crime series in which events from the future are downloaded from a satellite in space  Outcasts is set in the middle of the twenty first century on Carpathia  a so called Goldilocks planet five years  travel from Earth   edit  Canadian science fiction television Main article  Canadian science fiction television Science fiction in Canada was produced by the CBC as early as the 1950s  In the 1970s  CTV produced The Starlost  In the 1980s  Canadian animation studios including Nelvana  began producing a growing proportion of the world market in animation  In the 1990s  Canada became an important player in live action speculative fiction on television  with dozens of shows like Forever Knight  Robocop  and most notably The X Files and Stargate SG 1  Many shows have been produced for youth and children s markets  including Deepwater Black and MythQuest  In the early 2000s  changes in provincial tax legislation prompted many production companies to move from Toronto to Vancouver  Recent popular shows produced in Vancouver include The Dead Zone  Smallville  Andromeda  Stargate Atlantis  Stargate Universe  The 4400  Sanctuary  and the revised Battlestar Galactica  Because of the small size of the domestic television market  most Canadian productions involve partnerships with production studios based in the United States and Europe  However  in recent years  new partnership arrangements are allowing Canadian investors a growing share of control of projects produced in Canada and elsewhere   edit  Australian science fiction television Main article  Australian science fiction television Australia s best known Science Fiction show was Farscape  made with American co production  it ran from 1999 to 2003  Early shows made in the 1960s included The Interparis  1968  Vega 4  1967   and Phoenix Five  1970   A significant proportion of Australian produced Science Fiction programmes are made for the teens young Adults market  including The Girl from Tomorrow  the long running Mr  Squiggle  Halfway Across the Galaxy and Turn Left  Ocean Girl  Crash Zone  Watch This space  and Spellbinder  Other shows like Time Trax  Roar  and Space  Above and Beyond were filmed in Australia  but used mostly US crew and actors  5   edit  Japanese television science fiction Main articles  History of anime and Tokusatsu Japan has a long history of producing science fiction series for TV  Some of the most famous are anime such as Osamu Tezuka s Astro Boy  the Super Robots such as Mitsuteru Yokoyama s Tetsujin 28 go  Gigantor  and Go Nagai s Mazinger Z  and the Real Robots such as Yoshiyuki Tomino s Gundam series and Sh ji Kawamori s Macross series  Other primary aspects of Japanese science fiction TV are the superhero tokusatsu  a term literally meaning special effects  series  pioneered by programs such as Moonlight Mask and Planet Prince  The suitmation technique has been used in long running franchises include Eiji Tsuburaya s Ultra Series  Shotaro Ishinomori s Kamen Rider Series  and the Super Sentai Series  In addition  several dramas utilize science fiction elements as framing devices  but are not labeled as  tokusatsu  as they do not utilize actors in full body suits and other special effects   edit  Continental European science fiction series Main article  Continental European science fiction television After the second world war English became the main language for large television productions  which caused a blooming of science fiction series in the UK  but not in continental Europe  This together with a cultural climate that places more interest in historical and fantastic speculative fiction then the futuristic made the mostly German and French science fiction sparse and mostly aimed at children  The same sparseness science fiction can be found in the literairy tradition  but not in comics with the Franco Belgian and Dutch comics producing several scifi like titles   edit  Northern European series Among the notable German language productions is Lexx and Raumpatrouille  a German series first broadcast in 1966  Also well remembered in Germany are the movies by Rainer Erler  including the miniseries Das Blaue Palais Star Maidens  1975  aka  Medusa  or  Die M dchen aus dem Weltraum   was a british german coproduction of pure SF Danish television broadcast the children s TV series Crash in 1984 about a boy who finds out that his room is a space ship  Early Dutch television series were Morgen gebeurt het  tomorrow it will happen   broadcast from 1957 to 1959  about a group of Dutch space explorers and their adventures  De duivelsgrot  the devil s cave   broadcast from 1963 to 1964  about a scientist who finds the map of a cave that leads to the center of the earth and Treinreis naar de Toekomst  train journey to the future  about two young children who are taken to the future by robots who try to recreate humanity  but are unable to give the cloned humans a soul  All three of these television series where aimed mostly at children  but became popular with adults as well  Later television series were Professor Vreemdeling  1977  about a strange professor who wants to make plants speak and Zeeuws Meisje  1997  a nationalistic post apocalyptic series where the Netherlands has been built full of housing and the highways are filled with traffic jams  The protagonist  a female superhero  wears traditional folkloric clothes and tries to save traditional elements of Dutch society against the factory owners   edit  Italian series Italian Tv experienced a stint of interest in SF between 1970 and 1975   A come Andromeda   1972  was a remake of 1962 BBC miniseries  from the novels of Hoyle and Elliott   Two original teleplays created by Flavio Nicolini    Gamma   1974  and  La traccia verde   1975    Geminus   1968  and the highly influential  Il segno del comando  1970  should be classified into mystery stories than strict SF   edit  French series French series are Highlander  The Series French science fiction fantasy television series  both co produced with Canada  and a number of smaller fiction fantasy television series  including Tang in 1971  about a super secret organization that attempts to control the world with a new super weapon   Les atomistes  and bizarre 1970 miniseries  La brigade des mal fices   Another French produced science fiction series was the new age animated series Il  tait une fois    l espace  English  Once upon a time   space   An interesting phenomenon has been the continuing collaboration between French and Japanese animators  resulting in a series of French Japanese cartoons anime  including such titles as Ulysses 31  1981   The Mysterious Cities of Gold  1982   and more recently   ban Star Racers  2006    edit  Eastern European series Serbia produced The Collector  Sakuplja    a science fiction television series in the style of The Twilight Zone  based upon Zoran  ivkovi  s story  winner of a World Fantasy Award  Several science fiction series were also produced in various European countries  and never translated into English   edit  Speculative genres on television See also   Category Television genres Because of the need to market television to a wide audience  shows outside the loose realm of science fiction will often tend to gravitate to established tropes  such as time travel or superheroes   edit  Science fiction The classic mode of science fiction on television is space opera  in which a protagonist or a group of brave men and women venture into the black unknown  Starships are a conventional setting in this category  with Star Trek being the definitive example  Because the spacecraft environment is by definition limited  a very small number of sets can be heavily used  lowering production costs and allowing producers to focus on character development  setting detail  or sometimes simply to keep a production in the black so it can stay on the air  Variations on this are space station series  notably Babylon 5 and Star Trek  Deep Space Nine  based on an open port paradigm in which trouble comes in through the airlocks  Rarer are shows based on space travel without vehicles  Stargate SG 1 is the prime example  Near future settings work well for science fiction on television  shows such as The Six Million Dollar Man  TekWar  Quatermass  Star Cops  Mutant X  and Fringe allow budget conscious producers to use street clothes and contemporary locations  using only minimal props and effects to foster viewers  suspension of disbelief  Using stock sets for other shows results in odd subcategories like the science fiction western  some established shows also have the occasional episode   edit  Horror See also  Category Horror television series Due to the potentially upsetting nature of horror  many subject matters and themes that are acceptable in films  many of which are Rated R  would be unsuitable for general television audiences or must be heavily tamed  if not removed completely  On the one hand  horror can often be produced with inexpensive techniques  creative cinematography  pacing  lighting  fake blood or other simple props  prosthetics  or costumes  However  horror relies on a definitive resolution  often with a negative result for main characters  The episodic nature of television generally involves a resolution at the end of the episode  with characters surviving to the next episode  over time  this lessens the extreme tension required in horror  This makes horror an excellent genre for films  but much less so for television  though many anthology shows  notably The Twilight Zone  The Outer Limits  and Night Gallery  avoid the problem  Investigative shows  related to the mystery genre  such as Kolchak  The Night Stalker  also mostly avoid the issue  though they are hard on secondary characters   Shows with humorous elements  like The Chronicle  relieve tension for viewers but not characters in the show  making things more accessible to audiences  Some horror shows use common horror tropes such as vampires with more conventional dramatic forms like the heroic myth  for example Buffy the Vampire Slayer  or even gothic romance  Dark Shadows   Demonic powers and black magic are common themes in shows like Brimstone  Charmed  Hex  and Supernatural   edit  Adaptation with other media Main articles  Film adaptation and Literary adaptation Television is used as a medium for the visual presentation of fiction  In order to draw on an established audience  or simply to leverage the existing creativity of an author  television shows are sometimes based on novels or series of novels  The process of converting a print story is called adaptation  Producers  studios  or other intermediaries acquire the rights to produce shows based on a book with a contract known as an option  one might say  the studio optioned the book   Many popular novels are optioned  but only a tiny fraction of these ever materialize as an actual show  often  a producer who is interested in a particular show has to purchase an option from another producer who originally negotiated with the author  Rarely  other media are adapted for film  notably computer games  The reverse process of adaptation also occurs  Shows may be translated into print novels as novelizations  where an author is contracted to write a prose version of the story line  Just as television series are a collection of episodes  if there is a plan to convert a series to print  that usually is done as a series of novels  A popular series like Star Trek has resulted in hundreds of novelizations over the years  The visual content of a film is an excellent resource for the development of computer strategy or action games  As well  a series  particularly one that has lasted several seasons  has a rich background of character and setting detail that can provide a strong background and an established market for a role playing game  The most popular series and novels can result in adaptation in many different media   edit  Science fiction television production process and methods The need to portray imaginary settings or characters with properties and abilities beyond the reach of current reality obliges producers to make extensive use of specialized techniques of television production  Through most of the 20th century  many of these techniques were expensive and involved a small number of dedicated craft practitioners  while the reusability of props  models  effects  or animation techniques made it easier to keep using them  The combination of high initial cost and lower maintenance cost pushed producers into building these techniques into the basic concept of a series  influencing all the artistic choices  By the late 1990s  improved technology and more training and cross training within the industry made all of these techniques easier to use  so that directors of individual episodes could make decisions to use one or more methods  so such artistic choices no longer needed to be baked into the series concept   edit  Special effects Main article  Special effects Special effects  or  SPFX   have been an essential tool throughout the history of science fiction on television  small explosives to simulate the effects of various ray guns  squibs of blood and gruesome prosthetics to simulate the monsters and victims in horror shows  and the wire flying entrances and exits of George Reeves as Superman  The broad term  special effects  includes all the techniques here  but more commonly there are two categories of effects  Visual effects   VFX   involve photographic or digital manipulation of the onscreen image  usually done in post production  Mechanical or physical effects involve props  pyrotechnics  and other physical methods used during principal photography itself  Some effects involved a combination of techniques  a ray gun might require a pyrotechnic during filming  and then an optical glowing line added to the film image in post production  Stunts are another important category of physical effects  In general  all kinds of special effects must be carefully planned during pre production   edit  Computer generated imagery Main article  Computer generated imagery Babylon 5 was the first series to use computer generated imagery  or  CGI   for all exterior space scenes  even those with characters in space suits  The technology has made this more practical  so that today models are rarely used  In the 1990s  CGI required expensive processors and customized applications  but by the 2000s  computing power has pushed capabilities down to personal laptops running a wide array of software   edit  Models and Puppets Main articles  Scale model and Puppet Models have been an essential tool in science fiction television since the beginning  when Buck Rogers took flight in spark scattering spaceships wheeling across a matte backdrop sky  The original Star Trek required a staggering array of models  the USS Enterprise had to be built in several different scales for different needs  Models fell out of use in filming in the 1990s as CGI became more affordable and practical  but even today  designers sometimes construct scale models which are then digitized for use in animation software  Models of characters are puppets  Gerry Anderson created a series of shows using puppets living in a universe of models and miniature sets  notably Thunderbirds  In recent years  shows like Greg the Bunny and Puppets Who Kill have portrayed puppets as an oppressed minority  for which the politically correct term is  fabricated Americans  and the racial epithet is  sock   ALF depicted an alien living in a family  while Farscape included two puppets as regular characters  In Stargate SG 1  the Asgard characters are puppets in scenes where they are sitting  standing  or lying down   edit  Animation Main article  Animation See also  Anime As animation is completely free of the constraints of gravity  momentum  and physical reality  it is an ideal technique for science fiction and fantasy on television  In a sense  virtually all animated series allow characters and objects to perform in unrealistic ways  so they are almost all considered to fit within the broadest category of speculative fiction  in the context of awards  criticism  marketing  etc   The artistic affinity of animation to comic books has led to a large amount of superhero themed animation  much of this adapted from comics series  while the impossible characters and settings allowed in animation made this a preferred medium for both fantasy and for shows aimed at young audiences  Originally  animation was all hand drawn by artists  though in the 1980s  beginning with Captain Power  computers began to automate the task of creating repeated images  by the 1990s  hand drawn animation became defunct   edit  Animation in live action In recent years as technology has improved  this has become more common  notably since the development of the Massive software application permits producers to include hordes of non human characters to storm a city or space station  The robotic Cylons in the new version of Battlestar Galactica are usually animated characters  while the Asgard in Stargate SG 1 are animated when they are shown walking around or more than one is on screen at once   edit  Science fiction television economics and distribution In general  science fiction series are subject to the same financial constraints as other television shows  However  high production costs increase the financial risk  while limited audiences further complicate the business case for continuing production  Star Trek was the first television series to cost more than  100 000 per episode  while Star Trek  The Next Generation was the first to cost more than  1 million per episode  The innovative nature of science fiction means that new shows cannot rely on predictable market tested formulas like legal dramas or sitcoms  the involvement of creative talent outside the Hollywood mainstream introduces more variables to the budget forecasts  The perception  more than the reality  of science fiction shows being cancelled unreasonably is greatly increased by the attachment of fans to their favorite shows  which is much stronger in science fiction fandom than it is in the general population  While mainstream shows are often more strictly episodic  where ending shows can allow viewers to imagine that characters live happily  or at least normally  ever after  science fiction shows generate questions and loose ends that  when unresolved  cause dissatisfaction among devoted viewers  Creative settings also often call for broader story arcs than is often found in mainstream television  requiring science fiction shows many episodes to resolve an ongoing major conflict  Science fiction television producers will sometimes end a season with a dramatic cliffhanger episode to attract viewer interest  but the short term effect rarely influences financial partners  Dark Angel is one of many shows ending with a cliffhanger scene that left critical questions open when the series was cancelled   edit  Media fandom Main article  Media fandom See also  science fiction fandom and Trekkie One of the earliest forms of media fandom was Star Trek fandom  Fans of the series became known to each other through the science fiction fandom  In 1968  NBC decided to cancel Star Trek  Bjo Trimble wrote letters to contacts in the National Fantasy Fan Foundation  asking people to organize their local friends to write to the network to demand the show remain on the air  Network executives were overwhelmed by an unprecedented wave of correspondence  and they kept the show on the air  Although the series continued to receive low ratings and was canceled a year later  the enduring popularity of the series resulted in Paramount creating a set of movies  and then a new series Star Trek  The Next Generation  which by the early 1990s had become one of the most popular dramas on American television  Although somewhat smaller  Doctor Who fandom considerably predates Star Trek fandom  Meanwhile  Star Trek fans continued to grow in numbers  and began organizing conventions in the 1970s  No other show attracted a large organized following until the 1990s  when Babylon 5 attracted both Star Trek fans and a large number of literary SF fans who previously had not been involved in media fandom  Other shows began to attract a growing number of followers  In the late 1990s  Buffy the Vampire Slayer drew a large mainstream audience into fandom  greater demand allowed  even obliged  for the sake of time management  Buffy actors to charge much higher appearance fees than the Star Trek actors had  This pushed appearances out of the reach of some volunteer non profit fan groups towards commercial event promoters  At the same time  a market for celebrity autographs emerged on eBay  which created a new source of income for actors  who began to charge money for autographs that they had previously been doing for free  This became significant enough that lesser known actors would come to conventions without requesting any appearance fee  simply to be allowed to sell their own autographs  commonly on publicity photos   Today most events with actor appearances are organized by commercial promoters  though a number of fan run conventions still exist  such as Toronto Trek and Shore Leave  Also in the 1990s  anime fans began organizing conventions  These quickly grew to sizes much larger than other science fiction and media conventions in the same communities  many cities now have anime conventions attracting five to ten thousand attendees  Many anime conventions are a hybrid between non profit and commercial events  with volunteer organizers handling large revenue streams and dealing with commercial suppliers and professional marketing campaigns  For decades  the majority of science fiction media fandom has been represented by males of all ages and for most of its modern existence  a fairly diverse racial demographic  The most highly publicized demographic for science fiction fans is the male adolescent  roughly the same demographic for American comic books  Female fans  while always present  were far fewer in number and less conspicuously present in fandom  Starting in the 2000s  genre shows began to offer more prominent female characters  Many shows featured women as the main characters with males as supporting characters  True Blood is an example  Also  such shows premises moved away from heroic action adventure and focused more on characters and their relationships  This has caused the rising popularity of fanfiction  a large majority of which is categorized as slash fanfiction  Female fans comprise the majority of fanfiction writers   edit  Significant creative
