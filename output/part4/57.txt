wondering whether I could trust them or not  I went to a lot of schools along the coast in California  made few friends and stayed with aunts  uncles and grandparents while my folks tried to make ends meet  It was tough  We had no money     Tobey Maguire on identifying with Peter Parker  2  Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker   Spider Man Peter is an academically brilliant but socially inept boy who is bitten by a genetically modified spider and gains spider like abilities  Maguire was cast as Peter in July 2000  3  having been Sam Raimi s primary choice for the role after he saw The Cider House Rules  4  The studio was initially hesitant to cast someone who did not seem to fit the ranks of  adrenaline pumping  tail kicking titans   3  but Maguire managed to impress studio executives with his audition  The actor was signed for a deal in the range of  3 to  4 million with higher salary options for two sequels  3  To prepare  Maguire was trained by a physical trainer  a yoga instructor  a martial arts expert  and a climbing expert  taking several months to improve his physique  5  Maguire studied spiders and worked with a wire man to simulate the arachnidlike motion  and had a special diet  6  The studio had expressed interest in actors Leonardo DiCaprio  Freddie Prinze  Jr  7 Chris Klein  Wes Bentley  and Heath Ledger  8  DiCaprio had been considered by James Cameron for the role in 1995  9  while Raimi joked of Prinze that   he  won t even be allowed to buy a ticket to see this film   8  In addition  actors Scott Speedman  Jay Rodan  and James Franco were involved in screen

Carrey turned down the role  12  13  Dafoe insisted on wearing the uncomfortable costume as he felt that a stuntman would not convey the character s necessary body language  The 580 piece suit took half an hour to put on  8  Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson  The girl whom Peter Parker has developed a crush since he was six years old  Mary Jane has an abusive father  and aspires to become an actress  but becomes a waitress at a run down diner  a fact she hides from her boyfriend Harry  Before Raimi cast Dunst  he had expressed his interest in casting Alicia Witt  14  Dunst decided to audition after learning Maguire had been cast  feeling the film would have a more independent feel  15  Dunst earned the role a month before shooting in an audition in Berlin  8  James Franco as Harry Osborn  Before being cast as Peter s best friend and flatmate  Franco had screen tested for Spider Man himself  16  Cliff Robertson as Ben Parker  May Parker s husband and Peter Parker s uncle  a fired electrician who is trying to find a new job  He is killed by a carjacker whom Peter failed to stop  and leaves Peter with the message   With great power comes great responsibility   Rosemary Harris as May Parker  Ben Parker s wife and Peter Parker s aunt who is highly aware of Peter s love for Mary Jane  J  K  Simmons as J  Jonah Jameson  The grouchy publisher of the Daily Bugle who

Carradine  Elizabeth Banks as Betty Brant  As seen in past Spider Man comics  Betty Brant is Jameson s secretary who has a bit of a soft spot for Peter  Bruce Campbell  a long time colleague of director Sam Raimi  cameoed as the announcer at the wrestling ring Peter takes part in  Raimi himself appeared off screen  throwing popcorn at Peter as he enters the arena to wrestle Bonesaw McGraw  played by former professional wrestler  Macho Man  Randy Savage   17  Spider Man co creator Stan Lee also had a cameo  in which he asks Peter   Hey kid  would you like a pair of these glasses  They re

is actor Johnny Tri Nguyen  4  Kickboxer Benny  The Jet  Urquidez has an uncredited cameo as a mugger   edit  Production  edit  Development For more details on this topic  see Spider Man in film Development  In April 1999  although Sony Pictures optioned from Metro Goldwyn Mayer all preceding script versions of Spider Man  it only excersized the options on  the Cameron material   which contractually included a multi author screenplay and a 45 page  scriptment  credited only to James Cameron  The studio announced they were not hiring Cameron himself to direct the film  18  The studio lined up Roland Emmerich  Tim Burton  Chris Columbus  and David Fincher as potential directors  Fincher did not want to depict the origin story  pitching the film as being based on The Night Gwen Stacy Died storyline  but the studio disagreed  8 Sam Raimi was attached to direct in January 2000  19  for a summer 2001 release  20  He had been a big fan of the comic book during his youth  and his passion for Spider Man earned him the job  21  Cameron s work became the basis of David Koepp s first draft screenplay  often word for word  22  Cameron s versions of the Marvel villains Electro and Sandman remained the antagonists  Koepp s rewrite substituted the Green Goblin as the main antagonist and added Doctor Octopus as a secondary villain  23  Raimi felt the Green Goblin and the surrogate father son theme between Norman Osborn and Peter Parker would be more interesting  24  In June  Columbia hired Scott Rosenberg to rewrite of Koepp s material  Remaining a constant in all the rewrites was the  organic webshooter  idea from the Cameron  scriptment   25  Raimi felt he would stretch the audience s suspension of disbelief too far to have Peter invent mechanical webshooters  5  Rosenberg removed Doctor Octopus and created several new action sequences  26  Raimi felt adding a third origin story would make the film too complex  Sequences removed from the final film had Spider Man protecting Fargas  the wheelchair using Oscorp executive from the Goblin  and Spider Man defusing a hostage situation on a train  8  As production neared  producer Laura Ziskin hired her husband  award winning writer Alvin Sargent  to polish the dialogue  primarily between Peter and Mary Jane  27  Columbia offered David Koepp s name to the WGA as sole screenwriter  despite the fact that it had acquired Cameron s script and hired two subsequent writers  Without reading and comparing any of the material  the Writers Guild approved sole credit to Koepp  22   edit  Filming With Spider Man cast  filming was set to begin the following November in New York City and on Sony soundstages  The film was set for release a year later  3  but when the film was postponed to be released on May 3  2002  28  filming officially began on January 8  2001 27  in Culver City  Sony s Stage 29 was used for Peter s Forest Hills home  and Stage 27 was used for the wrestling sequence where Peter takes on Bonesaw McGraw  Randy Savage   Stage 27 was also used for the complex Times Square sequence where Spider Man and the Goblin battle for the first time  where a three story set with a breakaway balcony piece was built  The scene also required shooting in Downey  California  29  On March 6  30  45 year old construction worker Tim Holcombe was killed when a forklift modified as a construction crane crashed into a construction basket that he was in  The following court case led to the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health to fine Sony  58 805  31  In Los Angeles  locations included the Natural History Museum  for the Columbia University lab where Peter is bitten and receives his powers   the Pacific Electricity Building  the Daily Bugle offices  and Greystone Mansion  for the interiors of Norman Osborn s home   In April  some of the Spider Man costumes were stolen  and Sony put up a  25 000 reward  although they were never returned  32  Production moved to New York City for two weeks  taking in locations such as the Queensboro Bridge  the exterior of Columbia University s Low Library  the outside of the New York Public Library  and a rooftop garden in the Rockefeller Center  29  The crew returned to Los Angeles where production and filming ended in June  The Flatiron Building was used for the Daily Bugle  27   edit  Design Spider Man and the Green Goblin in combat  Spider Man s costume was made up of a single piece with a mask  The Green Goblin s costume was made up of 580 different pieces  Although it wound up being faithful to the comics  many designs were made for Spider Man s costumes  one concept costume designer James Acheson became fond of had a red emblem over a black costume  8  To create Spider Man s costume  Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit  being covered with layers of substance to create the suit s shape  33  It was designed as a single piece  except for the mask  The webbing  which accented the costume  was cut by computer  The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look  34  The Green Goblin s costume was created after Willem Dafoe was cast  as Dafoe rejected the initially bulky designs created beforehand  The finished design focused on a more streamlined and athletic feel  21  and the mask in particular was created to be an extreme cartoon version of his face  focusing on his long cheekbones  35  Some of the early designs were heavily inspired by black ops  One popular idea among the concept artists was to have the Goblin accompanied by adolescent women in costume and have their own gliders  Raimi hated the idea  8   edit  Effects Visual effects supervisor John Dykstra was hired to produce the visual effects for Spider Man in May 2000  36  He convinced Raimi to make many of the stunts computer generated  as they would have been physically impossible  Raimi had used more traditional special effects in his previous films and learned a lot about using computers during production  21  Raimi worked hard to plan all the sequences of Spider Man swinging from buildings  which he described as   ballet in the sky   The complexity of such sequences meant the budget rose from an initially planned  70 million to around  100 million  4  Shots were made more complicated because of the main characters  individual color schemes  so Spider Man and the Green Goblin had to be shot separately for effects shots  Spider Man was shot in front of a greenscreen  while the Green Goblin was shot against bluescreen  Shooting them together would have resulted in one character being erased from a shot  8  Saki said the biggest difficulty of creating Spider Man was that as the character was masked  it immediately lost a lot of characterization  Without the context of eyes or mouth  a lot of body language had to be put in so that there would be emotional content  Raimi wanted to convey the essence of Spider Man as being   the transition that occurs between him being a young man going through puberty and being a superhero   Dykstra said his crew of animators had never reached such a level of sophistication to give subtle hints of still making Spider Man feel like a human being  37  When two studio executives were shown shots of the computer generated character  they believed it was actually Maguire performing stunts  8  In addition  Dykstra s crew had to composite areas of New York City and replaced every car in shots with digital models  Raimi did not want it to feel entirely like animation  so none of the shots were 100  computer generated  38   edit  Release Original Spider Man teaser poster  which was recalled from theatres following 9 11 After the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11  2001  Sony recalled teaser posters which showed a close up of Spider Man s face with the New York skyline  including  prominently  the World Trade Center towers  reflected in his eyes  The movie s original teaser trailer  released in 2001  featured a mini movie plot involving a group of bank robbers escaping in a Eurocopter AS355 Twin Squirrel helicopter  which gets caught from behind and propelled backward into what at first appears to be a net  then is shown to be a gigantic spider web spun between the two towers at the World Trade Center  According to Sony the trailer did not contain any actual footage from the film itself and is consequently one of the most popular  Special Shoot  trailers since Terminator 2  Judgment Day  39  The trailer was pulled after the events of the September 11  2001 attacks  but can be found on the Internet  40  Before Spider Man s British theatrical release in June 2002  the BBFC gave the film a  12  certificate  Due to Spider Man s popularity with younger children  this prompted much controversy  The BBFC defended their decision  arguing that the film could have been given a  15   Despite this  North Norfolk and Breckland District Councils  in East Anglia  changed it to a  PG   and Tameside council  Manchester  denoted it a  PG 12   The United States rated it  PG 13   41  In late August  the BBFC relaxed their policy to  12A   leading Sony to re release the film  42   edit  Critical reception Spider Man received widespread critical acclaim  Film review site Rotten Tomatoes calculated an 89  overall approval based on 215 reviews  and it scored an 83  Top Critics rating from major news outlets  43  The casting  mainly Tobey Maguire  is often cited as one of the high points of the film  Eric Harrison  of the Houston Chronicle  was initially skeptical of the casting of Tobey Maguire  but  after seeing the film  he stated   within seconds  however  it becomes hard to imagine anyone else in the role   44 USA Today critic Mike Clark believed the casting rivaled that of Christopher Reeve as 1978 s Superman  45  Owen Gleiberman  of Entertainment Weekly  had mixed feelings about the casting  particularly Tobey Maguire   Maguire  winning as he is  never quite gets the chance to bring the two sides of Spidey   the boy and the man  the romantic and the avenger   together   46 The Hollywood Reporter s Kirk Honeycutt thought   the filmmakers  imaginations work in overdrive from the clever design of the cobwebby opening credits and Spider Man and M J  s upside down kiss   after one of his many rescues of her   to a finale that leaves character relationships open ended for future adventures   47  Not all of the criticism was positive  as LA Weekly s Manohla Dargis wrote   It isn t that Spider Man is inherently unsuited for live action translation  it s just that he s not particularly interesting or  well  animated   48  Giving it 2 5 4 stars  Roger Ebert felt the film lacked a decent action element   Consider the scene where Spider Man is given a cruel choice between saving Mary Jane or a cable car full of school kids  He tries to save both  so that everyone dangles from webbing that seems about to pull loose  The visuals here could have given an impression of the enormous weights and tensions involved  but instead the scene seems more like a bloodless storyboard of the idea   49  Stylistically  there was heavy criticism of the Green Goblin s costume  which led Richard George of IGN to comment years later   We re not saying the comic book costume is exactly thrilling  but the Goblin armor  the helmet in particular  from Spider Man is almost comically bad    Not only is it not frightening  it prohibits expression   50  Entertainment Weekly put  the kiss in Spider Man  on its end of the decade   best of  list  saying   There s a fine line between romantic and corny  And the rain soaked smooch between Spider Man and Mary Jane from 2002 tap dances right on that line  The reason it works  Even if she suspects he s Peter Parker  she doesn t try to find out  And that s sexy as hell   51   edit  Box office performance Spider Man was a major commercial success  becoming the first film to pass the  100 million mark in a single
