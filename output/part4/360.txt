thief  making many contacts  and quite a few enemies   During this period  Gambit found he had an uncontrollable amount of energy flowing through him  to the point that he could not withstand it  Desperate  Gambit went to Mister Sinister for help  Sinister modified Gambit s power by removing a portion of Gambit s brain stem  making him significantly less powerful  but able to control the still considerably large amount of power in him  volume  amp  issue needed  Years later  a much younger version of Mister Sinister surgically returned it  upon Gambit s request  when Gambit time traveled to the 19th century  volume  amp  issue needed  However  Sinister wanted the favor returned  so Gambit carried out various missions for him  For the last of these operations  Gambit gathered together a group of mercenaries which Sinister named the Marauders  The group included the mutant Sabretooth as one of its members  Gambit was then ordered to lead the Marauders into the tunnels under New York City  volume  amp  issue needed  He led Sabretooth  Blockbuster  Prism  and Riptide there while   unknown to Gambit   Scalphunter  Arclight  Harpoon  Malice  Scrambler  and Vertigo followed the Morlock Tommy into the tunnels  Their goal was to wipe out the Morlocks  Gambit was unable to prevent the Marauders from killing a considerable number of Morlocks  but he was able to save one  a child  Her name was Sarah  and she would grow up to be Marrow  the leader of the mutant terrorist group Gene Nation  Gambit long kept his involvement in the mission a secret from his fellow X Men  much to their eventual displeasure   edit  X Men After wandering around the world  he encountered a de aged and powerless Storm  and helped her escape from the Shadow King  1  He then rescued her from Nanny and the Orphan Maker  helping her battle them  7  Afterwards  the young amnesiac Storm  who had reverted to thieving to stay alive  joined Gambit  and she eventually brought him back to the X Men  Soon after  Gambit helped the X Men  X Factor  and New Mutants battle the Genoshans  8  Only Wolverine expressed his doubts about the Cajun  which led to a Danger Room duel between the two  Gambit was able to triumph by using a robotic doppelganger of Lady Deathstrike to distract Wolverine  while taking advantage of Wolverine s injuries  inflicted by the Reavers  9  Gambit and the X Men were then taken to the Shi ar galaxy by Lila Cheney  Alongside the X Men and Starjammers  Gambit battled Deathbird  the Imperial Guard  and a band of Warskrulls  10  Upon their return to Earth  Gambit assisted

Men  Gambit first encountered the second Ghost Rider  Gambit battled the Brood Queen and the Brood possessed Ghost Rider  and witnessed the apparent death of his now ex wife  Bella Donna  16  Gambit became interested in one of his teammates  Rogue  and started flirting with her  Despite her off putting manner and the obstacle of her uncontrollable power that prevented anyone from touching her  he began romancing Rogue  17  Their relationship was originally written as a one time  flirtatious moment  ironically  their relationship is listed as one of the longest and most popular on going relationships in the X Men series  probably only second to Jean Grey and Cyclops  18  Although their early  courtship  portrayed him as very  devil may care  in his flirtation with her  later issues revealed that  beneath his bravado and swagger  he truly had genuine romantic feelings for her  Similarly  despite her initial aggressive rejection of his advances  Rogue found that she was not only flattered by his attention  but that she felt equally attracted to him  Many publishing years later  it had become apparent R my had a dark secret  Sabretooth had hinted to it on numerous occasions during his  residency  at the X Mansion  prompting Rogue to ask him to reveal whatever he knew about Gambit s past  19  R my was captured and brought before a mock trial held by Magneto  the mutant Master of Magnetism  then disguised as Erik the Red  20  Rogue was forced to kiss him again  revealing that he had assembled the team of Marauders for Mr  Sinister that later killed most of the Morlocks  However it was also revealed that Gambit saved a single girl from the Marauders during the massacre  This apparent revelation and absorbing Gambit s own guilty memories caused Rogue to reject him  Gambit was similarly cast out of the X Men and was abandoned in the frozen wastes of Antarctica  volume  amp  issue needed  Starving  and haunted by the betrayal of his love  Rogue   Gambit made his way back into Magneto s citadel  where he encountered the psionic essence of a dead mutant named Mary Purcell  The wraith like Mary bonded with him  allowing him to survive until he reached the Savage Land  a hidden jungle nestled in the icy wasteland  There  R my struck a deal with an enigmatic being known as the New Son  In exchange for passage back to America  Gambit agreed to run errands with the help of friend Jacob Gavin Jr  volume  amp  issue needed  During this period R my s command over his abilities grew significantly  When Gambit s psyche absorption had worn off  Rogue spent months searching for him  to no avail  Gambit encountered the X Men again when he attempted to steal the fabled Crimson Gem of Cyttorak for his new employer  He agreed to return to the team  mainly for his self respect and for Rogue  At one point  he became the field leader of a branch of X Men  His love for Rogue was still intact  but her inability to control her powers made her break it off out of fear of hurting him  volume  amp  issue needed  Meanwhile  the New Son revealed his true identity as an alternate universe version of Gambit himself  after organizing an assassination game for a cadre of superpowered mercenaries with R my as the target  volume  amp  issue needed  During the final confrontation Gambit burned out his enhanced abilities  returning to his original level of power  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Bishop s future In Bishop s future timeline  Bishop stumbles upon a video from the past with Jean Grey making a frantic call to any X Men she can find  She says that the X Men have been betrayed by  one of their own  and it appears in the video that she is the last one left and is killed in the video  Disturbed by this  Bishop seeks  The Witness   a man who is said to be the last person who has ever seen the X Men of the past alive  He enters a citadel of sorts where he confronts an old and withered but plucky man with long gray hair sitting on a throne  with two blonde women to either side of him  When Bishop confronts him as to who killed the X Men the Witness acts as though he knows  but refuses to tell and Bishop is thrown out of the citadel  When Bishop comes to the X Men in their original timeline  he meets Gambit and is sure that he is the same old man in Bishop s future and that it was Gambit who was the  Traitor  that killed the X Men  For some time  he continues to watch Gambit s every step until he is finally convinced some time later that Gambit was not the Traitor  with Onslaught being revealed to be the traitor   The reason behind Gambit being called the Witness in Bishop s timeline has not been revealed  In the Messiah Complex  it was revealed that the Witness was killed by the Marauders in their efforts to destroy anyone with knowledge of the future   edit  X Treme X Men  XSE When Storm led a team of X Men in search of Destiny s diaries  the thirteen volume Books of Truth  Gambit volunteered to join them  but Rogue   afraid that her increasingly uncontrolled powers would bring him harm   flatly refused to allow him along  He returned to thievery instead  and was soon after framed by mutant businessman Sebastian Shaw for the death of the Australian crime lord named Viceroy  With the assistance of Rogue  Storm s team of X Treme X Men  and former Triad member Red Lotus  Gambit was able to clear his name  Soon after  R my became embroiled in the X Men s fight against an alien invasion of Earth led by the interdimensional warlord Khan  after trying to assemble the  Madripoor Set   a group of seven gems  The X Treme team s enemy  the enhanced human named Vargas  used the invasion as a chance to attempt to kill more of Storm s team  going after Rogue and Gambit  Rogue tried to shield R my against Vargas  sword  but he impaled them both as a reward for her fidelity  Both Rogue and Gambit survived  but lost their mutant abilities  for a time   As a result  the couple sought to live a normal life and sort out their relationship  retiring from the X Men temporarily   edit  Rejoining the team This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   October 2009  Gambit and Rogue rejoined the X Men soon after Sage jump started their powers  and they were placed on Havok s team  In their first mission back  Gambit was temporarily blinded by one of his energized cards that went off by his face  21  Rogue tried to console Gambit during his recovery  but their relationship became strained once more as he became more and more frustrated with his blindness and their lack of touch after Rogue s powers returned  He started lashing out at Rogue  most of the time verbally  As a result  Rogue took some time away from Gambit  While he lost his vision  Gambit developed an ability to read his playing cards like they were tarot cards and he was able to predict the attack by the Brotherhood  A little while later  during Christmas celebrations  Rogue asked Sage to once again jump start Gambit s powers  in the process  healing his vision  During the story arc with Golgotha  Gambit revealed some deep insecurities he had about his relationship with Rogue  not only did he say that  Maybe dis no touching thing is getting to me    more den I thought   22  but he also told Rogue that she should just get together with Logan  thinking that there was a hidden attraction between the two  As a result of the accusation  Logan kissed Rogue  but she broke it off before it caused any major damage  Gambit then began to realize what he was saying  questioning his love for Rogue  but soon after began to suffer from hallucinations that he was fighting Mister Sinister  However  Rogue and Gambit soon realized that Golgotha made them say things they did not mean and before the final battle  they  kissed  through their space suit helmets  Once back at the mansion  Gambit and Rogue moved into the same room to try rebuilding some intimacy  and began telepathic therapy with Emma Frost  They soon found out that with all the emotional baggage going on in their minds  they were still unable to make physical contact mentally  This would cause even more strain when the new student  Foxx  joins Gambit s team and attempts to seduce him   edit  Horseman of Apocalypse Gambit as the Horseman of Death  Art by Salvador Larroca  Rogue s foster mother Mystique was displeased with Rogue s choice of lovers and infiltrated Xavier s Institute by shapeshifting into a student called Foxx  She joined Gambit s squad in an attempt to ruin his relationship with Rogue  After Gambit resisted her charms  Mystique reverted to her true form and then offered Gambit something significantly more difficult to refuse  she transformed into Rogue and offered Gambit a Rogue with whom he could have a physical relationship  claiming that she was only trying to help relieve the increasing frustrations between the two lovers       if one of you could have some physical release      Rogue eventually discovered her mother s presence in the school and that Gambit knew she was there  To date  Gambit denies that he slept with Mystique  but there is yet to be a verification of his account  Upon the return of Apocalypse  Gambit submitted himself to the villain and was transformed into one of Apocalypse s Horsemen  Death  Gambit intended to infiltrate himself into Apocalypse s ranks in order to protect the X Men from the Dark Lord s eventual betrayal  but he miscalculated  as the transformation process warped his mind as well as his body  After becoming Death  Gambit s hair turned white and his skin turned deep black  Despite having his mind and body twisted  Gambit retained a large portion of his former self  stating to Apocalypse   I m both Death and Gambit   and he also remembered his love for Rogue as he could not bring himself to kill her  Gambit and Sunfire then returned to the Xavier Institute to claim Polaris  Gambit  in an attempt to free all ties with his old self  tried to kill Rogue and would have been successful had it not been for Pulse neutralizing Gambit s powers  After the X Men defeated Apocalypse  Sunfire left with Gambit to help him clear Apocalypse s brainwashing and live as entirely new beings  only to then be approached by Mister Sinister   edit  Marauders Gambit returned to his original appearance and powers  presumably with the aid of Mr  Sinister  and reemerged as a member of the Marauders  23  On a mission for Mr  Sinister  involving obtaining knowledge of the future  Gambit and Sunfire encountered Cable on the recently evacuated island of Providence  Before the fight Gambit said   I dropped that whole new look  wit  the help of a friend   He then asked Cable for use of his super computer to answer a question referring to the phrase  one minute before dawn   which tied into the then upcoming Messiah Complex storyline  As a result  Gambit and Sunfire attacked him eventually forcing Cable to activate a self destruct sequence destroying the entire island  24  Gambit and Sunfire escaped empty handed  During the fight  Cable noted that Gambit s accent sounded  forced  either for comic effect or perhaps to indicate that things may not be as  back to normal  as they seem with Gambit  24  As Gambit returned to Mr  Sinister s base to discuss the next step of the plan  he reprimanded Mystique for shooting Rogue when they abducted her  being placated only by Mr  Sinister s assurance that Rogue was still needed and would survive  In a recent confrontation with Cannonball and Iceman  he seemed to sympathize with a beaten Cannonball  He interfered when Scalphunter was about to kill Cannonball by attacking Cannonball and by his actions he was able to save Cannonball from certain death  At the same time  he also destroyed Destiny s diaries  preventing Sinister and the Marauders from getting them  25   edit  Messiah Complex Gambit is personally targeted by Wolverine during the X Men s assault on Mister Sinister s Antarctic base  26  After being tortured by the Canadian mutant  Gambit reveals that Cable has the baby before Sinister manages to regain the advantage and drive the X Men off with Gambit later revealed not to be harmed  Later  as Bishop attempts to kill the baby  after immobilizing Cable   Gambit and several of the Marauders quickly stop him with Gambit bringing a section of the ceiling down on Bishop  Knowing the X Men will arrive in moments  the Marauders depart with the baby  but not before Gambit ponders what could make Bishop turn on the X Men  27  Tracking Gambit using Cerebro  the X Men find that the Marauders  hideout was on Muir Island  However  what they didn t know is that Gambit let them track him  It appears that Gambit  along with Mystique  have plans of their own for the newborn mutant as evidenced by his lack of surprise when he delivered the baby to Sinister  who then reveals himself to be Mystique as the real Sinister lies on the floor with shock etched into his face  and the fact that Mystique told Gambit that it is time for the next step  28  A flashback sequence shows that Mystique used Rogue s intensified powers to kill Sinister  In the present she explains that everything she and Gambit have done has led to this moment as foretold by Destiny  Mystique touches the baby s face to Rogue s in the hope of sacrificing the child to save her  After an energy burst Gambit snatches the baby  saying that Rogue would never want an innocent life used to save hers  However  the child was unharmed by Rogue s touch  Gambit gives the baby to Xavier and says he wishes to stay with Rogue  Shortly after  Rogue awakens and tries to kill Mystique  However  somehow the baby cures her of her intensified powers  as well as any psyches she had ever absorbed  this leaves her with the psyche of only one other individual  Mystique  She tells Gambit she needs time alone and if he still cares for her  he would not follow  29  30   edit  Divided We Stand This section needs additional citations for verification

attackers  defeating them in short order before he is joined by Xavier himself  They determine who the Assassins were supposed to kill next from a list Gambit pulls from one of the goons  which includes Juggernaut  Sebastian Shaw  and Carter Ryking s  also known as Hazard   Xavier makes the connection between himself  Ryking  and Juggernaut  but is at a loss with Shaw  They go to see Ryking  who was being held in a mental institution  only to find out that he had just died of a brain hemorrhage the night before  Gambit and Xavier then drive out to the Nuclear Research Facility at Alamogordo  the place where the fathers of Xavier  Juggernaut  and Ryking all worked at some point in their lives and is most likely where Mister Sinister was running his genetic operations on the X gene  However  Xavier begins to suffer terrible headaches  and he and Gambit decide to wait it out in the desert for a few hours  where they are once again attacked by the Assassins Guild  31  Charles Xavier is abducted and taken to the Almagordo facility  where it is revealed that the employer of the assassins was Amanda Mueller  the head of the Black Womb Project  a former lover and prot g e of Mister Sinister  as well as direct ancestress of the Summers  line   who plans to use Charles to activate Sinister s Cronus machine  so as to be able to revive herself with Essex s own superpowered essence  Meanwhile  Gambit manages to defeat the rest of the assassins with the assistance of Sebastian Shaw  and they form a temporary alliance of convenience to destroy the Cronus machine  which threatens Shaw as well  and rescue Xavier  They ultimately manage to succeed with a desperate last minute life or death gamble when Gambit directly charges Shaw with biokinetic energy  giving him enough power to utterly shatter the otherwise indestructible machine  He begins searching Australia for Rogue and is again in the company of Professor Xavier  32  Gambit  however  is unsure of this venture  mainly because of Rogue s request that she be left alone  He and Xavier both agreed that if Rogue did not wish for their help or presence  they would do as she wished and leave her be  32  When Gambit and Xavier make it over the plains  they find a completely mismatched landscape  Fearing it is Rogue s doing  they go in and find various parts of Rogue s past being projected around them  including her fight against Nimrod and being captured and beaten at Genosha  Gambit finds it hard to control his emotions seeing Rogue in so much pain  but Xavier reminds him that none of it is real  While in the Genosha prison cells  Gambit and Xavier find the Shi ar parts hunters and they are told what is happening  They discover that Danger is the one causing the projections and is using Rogue s input from Danger Room sessions  Xavier decides it is better to find Danger first  coming to the conclusion that Danger is trying to push Rogue to some sort of realization  33  Eventually Xavier  Gambit and a group of Shi ar pirates manage to shut down Danger  However  the Professor reactivates her and she defeats the pirates in turn when they attack Gambit and Xavier  After this  it is revealed that Rogue s powers never truly developed past their initial  nascent  stage  which was the reason why her powers never functioned properly  The Professor  now aware of this fact  uses his telepathy to tear down the mental walls that kept Rogue s powers from developing as well as removing the mental echo of Mystique  Finally Rogue kisses Gambit  with no ill side effect  revealing that she is in control of her absorption power  34   edit  Utopia Gambit along with Rogue and Danger decide to go to San Francisco in order to regroup with the other X Men  On their way there they are intercepted by Pixie who teleports them into the city which is in a state of chaos due to the anti mutant and pro mutant movements  Cyclops sends all three out in order to locate several missing students and bring them home  Gambit locates Trance  Dragoness and Toad who are being pursued by H A M M E R  agents  Ariel and Onyxx appear and take Trance away for safety  35  Later on he encounters Erg and Avalanche who attacks Ares  Gambit intervenes only to end up being swatted aside by Ares  Danger and Rogue come to his aid which eventually leads to Rogue absorbing Ares s powers  Gambit then blasts him unconscious  Having for the moment absorbed some of Ares s power  Rogue easily dispatches a small group of H A M M E R  agents and proceedes to steal their tank  along with Gambit and Danger  in order to find the rest of the students and Trance who didn t make it back to base  Trance appears to be lost in the city  and under attack of Ms  Marvel from the Dark Avengers team  Gambit

headquarters  There  he fights H A M M E R  s mutate guards Hijack and Input  Hijack is easily defeated  however Input is another story  Input uses his telepathic abilities to enter Gambit s head and discovers there are still left overs from Remy s  Death  persona  Death re emerges and defeats Input  and absorbed him into a playing card  which turns black upon doing so  Afterward  R my somehow returns to normal  with a smile on his face  Gambit then completes his mission  destroys the chair  and returns to the X Men  37  When he made it back to Utopia  Gambit got angry at Cyclops for letting Rogue go up against the villain Emplate all alone  R my tried to argue with Cyclops  but suddenly got trouble with mood swings and left the group  He changed back into his Death persona  and remembered how Apocalypse told him he would never be the same after undergoing the changing process  Gambit managed to calm himself down and transform back to his normal self  but he is worried about his condition  38   edit  X Men  Second Coming Gambit  along with Dazzler  Anole  Northstar  Cannonball  Pixie and Trance travel to Limbo to rescue Magik  Things go wrong when the ground starts to

48 Gambit will be joining the new team of Wolverine  Iceman  Northstar  Karma  Cecilia Reyes and Warbird  48   edit  Powers and abilities Gambit is a mutant who has the power to take the potential energy stored in an object and convert it to kinetic energy thus  charging  that item with explosive results  He prefers to charge smaller objects  such as his ever present playing cards  as the time required to charge them is greatly reduced and they are much easier for him to throw  The only real limitation to this ability is the time required to charge the object  the larger it is the more time it takes to charge  Most charging takes place through direct skin contact  The power of his explosions is dependent on the mass of the object he is charging  for example  a charged playing card explodes with the force of a grenade  Gambit can also use his powers to accelerate an object s kinetic energy instead of converting its potential energy  for example  he can charge his Bo staff with enough power to level a house  Gambit s ability to tap energy also grants him superhuman physical abilities  speed  reflexes and reactions  agility  flexibility  dexterity  coordination  balance  and endurance   as his body constantly generates bio kinetic energy and so is perfectly constructed for constant motion  This gives him an added edge that he has used to his advantage by developing a unique acrobatic fighting style  He also has the ability to create static  because of the charged potential energy always in his body  that shields his mind from detection and intrusion by even the most powerful telepaths  The shield has the added effect of destabilizing touch based powers  Gambit also possesses a hypnotic charm that allows him to exert a subtle influence over sentient beings  leading them to believe what he says and agree with his suggestions  This charm is so powerful that if given a chance  Gambit could charm the Shadow King  1  However  the charm does not work on those who know about it  49  During combat  Gambit customarily wears a suit of highly articulated light body armor and uses an extendable metal staff  He is extensively trained in martial arts  particularly French kick boxing or Savate and the staff style art Bojutsu  He is an excellent hand to hand combatant  applying street fighting techniques and acrobatics  Gambit is a skilled card thrower  so he throws his charged playing cards at opponents with great accuracy  He also excels in all aspects of thievery  as he was adopted by the patriarch of a Thieves Guild  volume  amp  issue needed  After Apocalypse used the Celestial Technology to transform Gambit into the Horseman Death  Gambit demonstrates the ability to convert inert materials into toxic substances  such as transforming breathable air into poisonous gases  and has the potential to ingest diseases and plagues  50  It is apparent that the Celestial Technology never left his system  as seen during a telepathic attack against him that brought out temporarily the Death persona  which eventually killed the attacker  volume  amp  issue needed  Gambit s body did subsequently return to normal  suggesting that Gambit now has the ability to switch between his own and Death appearances  51  52  Gambit was temporarily given the full potential of his powers to battle his counterpart New Son  volume  amp  issue needed  At his full power  Gambit can control all aspects of kinetic energy down even to the molecular level  allowing him to manipulate the potency of his bio kinetic energy to burn  cause molecular discomfort  incinerate  create timed detonations  and manipulate the potency of the energy release   fire energy blasts  defy gravity  heal wounds  charge objects within his line of sight without contact  and effectively exist as an energy being  Under such conditions  he holds sufficient power to cause another being to be unable to move or unable to stop if in motion  He has been able to cause or simulate various energies by manipulating the kinetic energy present  such as infrared and microwaves  by increasing molecular agitation  or cold by reducing it  He was also able to use his powers to travel through time by transforming himself into living energy which joined with the kinetic flow  volume  amp  issue needed  Finally  Gambit was able to heal himself by stimulating his cellular activity  These enhanced powers were burnt out after fighting New Son  volume  amp  issue needed  and Gambit has since returned to his original  somewhat lower power levels  volume  amp  issue needed   However  after Sage jumpstarted his powers again  he was able to heal his blinded eyes volume  amp  issue needed  thus implying he is again able to heal himself and is also able again to charge living things with energy  as when he teamed up with Sebastian Shaw to destroy Mr  Sinister s machines  volume  amp  issue needed  Gambit was temporarily blinded due to a card in his hand being hit and exploding  volume  amp  issue needed  During this period  he was able to  see  images in his cards  Gambit is fluent in various languages  primarily English and Cajun French Acadian French   edit  Other versions
