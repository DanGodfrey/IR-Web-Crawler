non consecutive terms  1885 1889 and 1893 1897  and therefore is the only individual to be counted twice in the numbering of the presidents  He was the winner of the popular vote for president three times in 1884  1888  and 1892 and was the only Democrat elected to the presidency in the era of Republican political domination that lasted from 1861 to 1913  Cleveland was the leader of the pro business Bourbon Democrats who opposed high tariffs  Free Silver  inflation  imperialism and subsidies to business  farmers or veterans  His battles for political reform and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for American conservatives of the era  1  Cleveland won praise for his honesty  independence  integrity  and commitment to the principles of classical liberalism  2  Cleveland relentlessly fought political corruption  patronage  and bossism  Indeed  as a reformer his prestige was so strong that the reform wing of the Republican Party  called  Mugwumps   largely bolted the GOP ticket and swung to his support in 1884  3  Disaster hit the nation as his second term began when the Panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression that Cleveland was unable to reverse  It ruined his Democratic party  opening the way for a Republican landslide in 1894  and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of his Democratic party in 1896  The result was a political realignment that ended the Third Party System and launched the Fourth Party System and the Progressive Era  4  Cleveland took strong positions and was heavily criticized  His intervention in the Pullman Strike of 1894 to keep the railroads moving angered labor unions nationwide and angered the party in Illinois  his support of the gold standard and opposition to Free Silver alienated the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party  5  Furthermore  critics complained that he had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation s economic disasters depressions and strikes in his second term  5  Even so  his reputation for honesty and good character survived the troubles of his second term  Biographer Allan Nevins wrote   in Grover Cleveland the greatness lies in typical rather than unusual qualities  He had no endowments that thousands of men do not have  He possessed honesty  courage  firmness  independence  and common sense  But he possessed them to a degree other men do not   6  Contents 1 Family

Falley Cleveland and Ann Neal Cleveland  7  Cleveland s father was a Presbyterian minister  originally from Connecticut  8  His mother was from Baltimore  the daughter of a bookseller  9  On his father s side  Cleveland was descended from English ancestors  the first Cleveland having emigrated to Massachusetts from northeastern England in 1635  10  On his mother s side  Cleveland was descended from Anglo Irish Protestants and German Quakers from Philadelphia  11  He was distantly related to General Moses Cleaveland after whom the city of Cleveland  Ohio  was named  12  Cleveland s birthplace  in Caldwell  New Jersey Cleveland  the fifth of nine children  was named Stephen Grover in honor of the first pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Caldwell  where his father was pastor at the time  but he did not use the name Stephen in his adult life  13  In 1841  the Cleveland family moved to Fayetteville  New York  where Grover spent much of his childhood  14  Neighbors would later describe him as  full of fun and inclined to play pranks   15  and fond of outdoor sports  16  In 1850  Cleveland s father took a pastorate in Clinton  Oneida County  New York  and the family relocated there  17  They moved again in 1853 to Holland Patent  New York  near Utica  18  Not long after the family arrived in Holland Patent  Cleveland s father died  18  Education and moving west Cleveland s elementary education came at the Fayetteville Academy and the Clinton Liberal Academy  19  After his father died in 1853  Cleveland left school and helped to support his family  Later that year  Cleveland s brother William was hired as a teacher at the New York Institute for the Blind in New York City  and William obtained a place for Cleveland as an assistant teacher  He returned home to Holland Patent at the end of 1854  20  An elder in his church offered to pay for his college education if he would promise to become a minister  but Cleveland declined  Instead  in 1855 Cleveland decided to move west  He stopped first in Buffalo  New York  where his uncle  Lewis W  Allen gave him a clerical job  21  Allen was an important man in Buffalo  and he introduced his nephew to influential men there  including the partners in the law firm of Rogers  Bowen  and Rogers  22  Cleveland later took a clerkship with the firm  and was admitted to the bar in 1859  23  Early career and the Civil War An early  undated photograph of Grover Cleveland 24  After becoming a lawyer  Cleveland worked for the Rogers firm for three years  leaving in 1862 to start his own practice  25  In January 1863  he was appointed assistant district attorney of Erie County  26  With the American Civil War raging  Congress passed the Conscription Act of 1863  requiring able bodied men to serve in the army if called upon  or else to hire a substitute  23  Cleveland chose the latter course  paying George Benninsky  a thirty two year old Polish immigrant   150 to serve in his place  27  As a lawyer  Cleveland became known for his single minded concentration and dedication to hard work  28  In 1866  he defended some participants in the Fenian raid of that year  doing so successfully and free of charge  29  In 1868  Cleveland attracted some attention within his profession for his successful defense of a libel suit against the editor of the Commercial Advertiser  a Buffalo newspaper  30  During this time  Cleveland lived simply in a boarding house  although his income grew sufficient to support a more lavish lifestyle  Cleveland continued to support his mother and younger sisters  31  While his personal quarters were austere  Cleveland did enjoy an active social life and enjoyed  the easy going sociability of hotel lobbies and saloons   32  Political career in New York Sheriff of Erie County From his earliest involvement in politics  Cleveland aligned himself with the Democratic Party  33  In 1865  he ran for District Attorney  losing narrowly to his friend and roommate  Lyman K  Bass  the Republican nominee  28  Cleveland then stayed out of politics until 1870 when  with the help of his friend  Oscar Folsom  he secured the Democratic nomination for sheriff of Erie County  34  At the age of thirty three  Cleveland found himself elected sheriff by a 303 vote margin  taking office on January 1  1871  35  While this new career took him away from the practice of law  it was rewarding in other ways  the fees were said to yield up to  40 000  US 800 thousand in present terms 36   over the two year term  34  The most well known incident of his term took place on September 6  1872  It involved the execution of Patrick Morrissey  who had been convicted of murdering his mother  37  As sheriff  Cleveland was responsible for either personally carrying out the execution or paying a deputy  10 to perform the task  37  Cleveland  in spite of reservations about the hanging  opted to carry out the duty himself  37  He hanged another murderer  John Gaffney  on February 14  1873  38  After his term as sheriff ended  Cleveland returned to private practice  opening a law firm with his friends Lyman K  Bass and Wilson S  Bissell  39  Bass did not spend much time at the firm  being elected to Congress in 1873  but Cleveland and Bissell soon found themselves at the top of Buffalo s legal community  40  Up to that point  Cleveland s political career had been honorable but unremarkable  As biographer Allan Nevins wrote   probably no man in the country  on March 4  1881  had less thought than this limited  simple  sturdy attorney of Buffalo that four years later he would be standing in Washington and taking the oath as president of the United States   41  Mayor of Buffalo In the 1870s  the government of Buffalo had grown increasingly corrupt  with Democratic and Republican political machines cooperating to share the spoils  42  When  in 1881  the Republicans nominated a slate of particularly disreputable machine politicians  the Democrats saw the opportunity to gain the votes of disaffected Republicans by nominating a more honest candidate  43  The party leaders approached Cleveland  and he agreed to run for mayor  provided that the rest of the ticket was to his liking  44  When the more notorious politicians were left off the Democratic ticket  Cleveland accepted the nomination  44  Cleveland was elected mayor with 15 120 votes  as against 11 528 for Milton C  Beebe  his opponent  45  He took office January 2  1882  Cleveland s term as mayor was spent fighting the entrenched interests of the party machines  46  Among the acts that established his reputation was a veto of the street cleaning bill passed by the Common Council  47  The street cleaning contract was open for bids  and the Council selected the highest bidder  rather than the lowest  because of the political connections of the bidder  47  While this sort of bipartisan graft had previously been tolerated in Buffalo  Mayor Cleveland would have none of it  and replied with a stinging veto message   I regard it as the culmination of a most bare faced  impudent  and shameless scheme to betray the interests of the people  and to worse than squander the public money   48  The Council reversed themselves and awarded the contract to the lowest bidder  49  For this  and several other acts to safeguard the public funds  Cleveland s reputation as an honest politician began to spread beyond Erie County  50  Governor of New York Statue of Grover Cleveland outside City Hall in Buffalo  New York As Cleveland s reputation grew  state Democratic party officials began to consider him a possible nominee for governor  51 Daniel Manning  a party insider who admired Cleveland s record  promoted his candidacy  52  With a split in the state Republican party  1882 looked to be a Democratic year  and there were several contenders for that party s nomination  51  The two leading Democratic candidates were Roswell P  Flower and Henry W  Slocum  but their factions deadlocked  and the convention could not agree on a nominee  53  Cleveland  in third place on the first ballot  picked up support in subsequent votes and emerged as the compromise choice  54  The Republican party remained divided against itself  and in the general election Cleveland emerged the victor  with 535 318 votes to Republican nominee Charles J  Folger s 342 464  55  Cleveland s margin of victory was  at the time  the largest in a contested New York election  and the Democrats also picked up seats in both houses of the New York State Legislature  56  Continuing his opposition to unnecessary spending  Cleveland sent the legislature eight vetos in his first two months in office  57  The first to attract attention was his veto of a bill to reduce the fares on New York City elevated trains to five cents  58  The bill had broad support because the trains  owner  Jay Gould  was unpopular  and his fare increases were widely denounced  59  Cleveland saw the bill as unjust Gould had taken over the railroads when they were failing and had made the system solvent again  60  Moreover  Cleveland believed that altering Gould s franchise would violate the Contract Clause of the federal Constitution  60  Despite the initial popularity of the measure  the newspapers praised Cleveland s veto  60 Theodore Roosevelt  then a member of the Assembly  said that he had initially voted for the bill believing it was wrong  but wishing to punish the unscrupulous railroad barons  61  After the veto  Roosevelt reversed himself  as did many legislators  and the veto was sustained  61  Cleveland s blunt  honest ways won him popular acclaim  but they also gained him the enmity of certain factions of his own party  especially the Tammany Hall organization in New York City  62  Tammany  under its boss  John Kelly  had not supported Cleveland s nomination as governor  and disliked him all the more when Cleveland openly opposed the re election of one of their State Senators  63  Losing Tammany s support was balanced  however  by gaining the support of Theodore Roosevelt and other reform minded Republicans who helped Cleveland to pass several laws reforming municipal governments  64  Election of 1884 Main article  United States presidential election  1884 Nomination for president Main article  1884 Democratic National Convention The Republicans convened in Chicago and nominated former Speaker of the House James G  Blaine of Maine for president on the fourth ballot  Blaine s nomination alienated many Republicans who viewed Blaine as ambitious and immoral  65  Democratic party leaders saw the Republicans  choice as an opportunity to take back the White House for the first time since 1856 if the right candidate could be found  65  An anti Blaine cartoon presents him as the  tattooed man   with many indelible scandals  An anti Cleveland cartoon highlights the Halpin scandal  Among the Democrats  Samuel J  Tilden was the initial front runner  having been the party s nominee in the contested election of 1876  66  Tilden  however  was in poor health  and after he declined to be nominated  his supporters shifted to several other contenders  66  Cleveland was among the leaders in early support  but Thomas F  Bayard of Delaware  Allen G  Thurman of Ohio  Samuel Freeman Miller of Iowa  and Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts also had considerable followings  along with various favorite sons  66  Each of the other candidates had hindrances to his nomination  Bayard had spoken in favor of secession in 1861  making him unacceptable to Northerners  Butler  conversely  was reviled throughout the South for his actions during the Civil War  Thurman was generally well liked  but was growing old and infirm  and his views on the silver question were uncertain  67  Cleveland  too  had detractors Tammany remained opposed to him but the nature of his enemies made him still more friends  68  Cleveland led on the first ballot  with 392 votes out of 820  69  On the second ballot  Tammany threw its support behind Butler  but the rest of the delegates shifted to Cleveland  and he was nominated  70 Thomas A  Hendricks of Indiana was selected as his running mate  70  Campaign against Blaine Corruption in politics was the central issue in 1884  and Cleveland s reputation as an opponent of corruption proved the Democrats  strongest asset  71  Reform minded Republicans called  Mugwumps  denounced Blaine as corrupt and flocked to Cleveland  72  The Mugwumps  including such men as Carl Schurz and Henry Ward Beecher  were more concerned with morality than with party  and felt Cleveland was a kindred soul who would promote civil service reform and fight for efficiency in government  72  At the same time the Democrats gained support from the Mugwumps  they lost some blue collar workers to the Greenback Labor party  led by ex Democrat Benjamin Butler  73  The campaign focused on the candidates  personalities  as each candidate s supporters cast aspersions on their opponents  Cleveland s supporters rehashed the old allegations that Blaine had corruptly influenced legislation in favor of the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad and the Union Pacific Railway  later profiting on the sale of bonds he owned in both companies  74  Although the stories of Blaine s favors to the railroads had made the rounds eight years earlier  this time Blaine s correspondence was discovered  making his earlier denials less plausible  74  On some of the most damaging correspondence  Blaine had written  Burn this letter   giving Democrats the last line to their rallying cry   Blaine  Blaine  James G  Blaine  the continental liar from the state of Maine   Burn this letter   75  To counter Cleveland s image of superior morality  Republicans discovered reports that Cleveland had fathered an illegitimate child while he was a lawyer in Buffalo  and chanted  Ma  Ma  where s my Pa    76  When confronted with the emerging scandal  Cleveland s instructions to his campaign staff were   Tell the truth   77  Cleveland admitted to paying child support in 1874 to Maria Crofts Halpin  the woman who claimed he fathered her child named Oscar Folsom Cleveland  76  Halpin was involved with several men at the time  including Cleveland s friend and law partner  Oscar Folsom  for whom the child was also named  76  Cleveland did not know which man was the father  and is believed to have assumed responsibility because he was the only bachelor among them  76  Both candidates believed that the states of New York  New Jersey  Indiana  and Connecticut would determine the election  78  In New York  the Tammany Hall Democrats  after vacillating  decided that they would gain more from supporting a Democrat they disliked than a Republican who would do nothing for them  79  Blaine hoped that he would have more support from Irish Americans than Republicans typically did  while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century  Blaine s mother was Irish Catholic  and he had been supportive of the Irish National Land League while he was Secretary of State  80  The Irish  a significant group in three of the swing states  did appear inclined to support Blaine until one of his supporters  Samuel D  Burchard  gave a speech denouncing the Democrats as the party of  Rum  Romanism  and Rebellion   81  The Democrats spread the word of this insult in the days before the election  and Cleveland narrowly won all four of the swing states  including New York by just over one thousand votes  82  While the popular vote total was close  with Cleveland winning by just one quarter of a percent  the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219 182  82  Following the electoral victory  the  Ma  Ma      attack phrase gained a classic rejoinder   Gone to the White House  Ha  Ha  Ha   83  First term as president  1885 1889  Reform Cleveland  portrayed as a tariff reformer Soon after taking office  Cleveland was faced with the task of filling all the government jobs for which the president had the power of appointment  These jobs were typically filled under the spoils system  but Cleveland announced that he would not fire any Republican who was doing his job well  and would not appoint anyone solely on the basis of party service  84  He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees  as many departments had become bloated with political time servers  85  Later in his term  as his fellow Democrats chafed at being excluded from the spoils  Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats  86  While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns  more of Cleveland s appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors  administrations  87  Cleveland also reformed other parts of the government  In 1887 he signed an act creating the Interstate Commerce Commission  88  He and Secretary of the Navy William C  Whitney undertook to modernize the navy and canceled construction contracts that had resulted in inferior ships  89  Cleveland angered railroad investors by ordering an investigation of western lands they held by government grant  90 Secretary of the Interior Lucius Q C  Lamar charged that the rights of way for this land must be returned to the public because the railroads failed to extend their lines according to agreements  90  The lands were forfeited  resulting in the return of approximately 81 000 000 acres  330 000 km2   90  Vetoes Cleveland faced a Republican Senate and often resorted to using his veto powers  91  He vetoed hundreds of private pension bills for American Civil War veterans  believing that if their pensions requests had already been rejected by the Pensions Bureau  Congress should not attempt to override that decision  92  When Congress  pressured by the Grand Army of the Republic  passed a bill granting pensions for disabilities not caused by military service  Cleveland also vetoed that  93  Cleveland used the veto far more often than any president up to that time  94  In 1887  Cleveland issued his most well known veto  that of the Texas Seed Bill  95  After a drought had ruined crops in several Texas counties  Congress appropriated  10 000 to purchase seed grain for farmers there  95  Cleveland vetoed the expenditure  In his veto message  he espoused a theory of limited government  I can find no warrant for such an appropriation in the Constitution  and I do not believe that the power and duty of the general government ought to be extended to the relief of individual suffering which is in no manner properly related to the public service or benefit  A prevalent tendency to disregard the limited mission of this power and duty should  I think  be steadfastly resisted  to the end that the lesson should be constantly enforced that  though the people support the government  the government should not support the people  The friendliness and charity of our countrymen can always be relied upon to relieve their fellow citizens in misfortune  This has been repeatedly and quite lately demonstrated  Federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character  while it prevents the indulgence among our people of that kindly sentiment and conduct which strengthens the bonds of a common brotherhood  96  Silver One of the most volatile issues of the 1880s was whether the currency should be backed by gold and silver  or by gold alone  97  The issue cut across party lines  with western Republicans and southern Democrats joining together in the call for the free coinage of silver  and both parties  representatives in the northeast holding firm for the gold standard  98  Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold  taxpayers paid their government bills in silver  while international creditors demanded payment in gold  resulting in a depletion of the nation s gold supply  98  Cleveland and Treasury Secretary Daniel Manning stood firmly on the side of the gold standard  and tried to reduce the amount of silver that the government was required to coin under the Bland Allison Act of 1878  99  This angered Westerners and Southerners  who advocated for cheap money to help their poorer constituents  100  In reply  one of the foremost silverites  Richard P  Bland  introduced a bill in 1886 that would require the government to coin unlimited amounts of silver  inflating the then deflating currency  101  While Bland s bill was defeated  so was a bill the administration favored that would repeal any silver coinage requirement  101  The result was a retention of the status quo  and a postponement of the resolution of the Free Silver issue  102  Tariffs  When we consider that the theory of our institutions guarantees to every citizen the full enjoyment of all the fruits of his industry and enterprise  with only such deduction as may be his share toward the careful and economical maintenance of the Government which protects him  it is plain that the exaction of more than this is indefensible extortion and a culpable betrayal of American fairness and justice     The public Treasury  which should only exist as a conduit conveying the people s tribute to its legitimate objects of expenditure  becomes a hoarding place for money needlessly withdrawn from trade and the people s use  thus crippling our national energies  suspending our country s development  preventing investment in productive enterprise  threatening financial disturbance  and inviting schemes of public plunder   Cleveland s third annual message to Congress  December 6  1887  103  Another contentious financial issue at the time was the protective tariff  While it had not been a central point in his campaign  Cleveland s opinion on the tariff was that of most Democrats  that the tariff ought to be reduced  104  Republicans generally favored a high tariff to protect American industries  104  American tariffs had been high since the Civil War  and by the 1880s the tariff brought in so much revenue that the government was running a surplus  105  In 1886  a bill to reduce the tariff was narrowly defeated in the House  106  The tariff issue was emphasized in the Congressional elections that year  and the forces of protectionism increased their numbers in the Congress  107  Nevertheless  Cleveland continued to advocate tariff reform  As the surplus grew  Cleveland and the reformers called for a tariff for revenue only  108  His message to Congress in 1887  quoted at right  pointed out the injustice of taking more money from the people than the government needed to pay for its operating expenses  109  Republicans  as well as protectionist northern Democrats like Samuel J  Randall  believed that without high tariffs American industries would fail  and continued to fight reformers  efforts  110 Roger Q  Mills  the chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means  proposed a bill that would reduce the tariff burden from about 47  to about 40   111  After significant exertions by Cleveland and his allies  the bill passed the House  111  The Republican Senate  however  failed to come to agreement with the Democratic House  and the bill died in the conference committee  Dispute over the tariff would carry over into the 1888 presidential election  Foreign policy  1885 1889 Cleveland was a committed non interventionist who had campaigned in opposition to expansion and imperialism  He refused to promote the previous administration s Nicaragua canal treaty  and generally was less of an expansionist in foreign relations  112  Cleveland s Secretary of State  Thomas F  Bayard  negotiated with Joseph Chamberlain of the United Kingdom over fishing rights in the waters off Canada  and struck a conciliatory note  despite the opposition of New England s Republican Senators  113  Cleveland also withdrew from Senate consideration the Berlin Conference treaty which guaranteed an open door for U S  interests in the Congo  114  Civil rights Cleveland  like a growing number of Northerners  and nearly all white Southerners  saw Reconstruction as a failed experiment  and was reluctant to use federal power to enforce the 15th Amendment of the U S  Constitution  which guaranteed voting rights to African Americans  115  Cleveland initially appointed no black Americans to patronage jobs  but did allow Frederick Douglass to continue in his post as recorder of deeds in Washington  D C  115  When Douglass later resigned  Cleveland appointed another black man to replace him  115  Henry L  Dawes wrote the Dawes Act  which Cleveland signed into law  Although Cleveland had condemned the  outrages  against Chinese immigrants  he believed that Chinese immigrants were unwilling to assimilate into white society  116  Secretary of State Bayard negotiated an extension to the Chinese Exclusion Act  and Cleveland lobbied the Congress to pass the Scott Act  written by Congressman William Lawrence Scott  which would prevent Chinese immigrants who left the United States from returning  117  The Scott Act easily passed both houses of Congress  and Cleveland signed it into law on October 1  1888  117  Indian policy Cleveland viewed Native Americans as wards of the state  saying in his first inaugural address that   t his guardianship involves  on our part  efforts for the improvement of their condition and enforcement of their rights   118  He encouraged the idea of cultural assimilation  pushing for the passage of the Dawes Act  which provided for distribution of Indian lands to individual members of tribes  rather than having them continued to be held in trust for the tribes by the federal government  118  While a conference of Native leaders endorsed the act  in practice the majority of Native Americans disapproved of it  119  Cleveland believed the Dawes Act would lift Native Americans out of poverty and encourage their assimilation into white society  but its ultimate effect was to weaken the tribal governments and allow individual Indians to sell land and keep the money  118  In the month before Cleveland s 1885 inauguration  President Arthur opened four million acres of Winnebago and Crow Creek Indian lands in the Dakota Territory to white settlement by executive order  120  Tens of thousands of settlers gathered at the border of these lands and prepared to take possession of them  120  Cleveland believed Arthur s order to be in violation of treaties with the tribes  and rescinded it on April 17 of that year  ordering the settlers out of the territory  120  Cleveland sent in Eighteenth Army troops to enforce the treaties and ordered General Philip Sheridan to investigate the matter  120  Marriage and children Grover Cleveland and Frances Folsom were married in the Blue Room of the White House  Cleveland entered the White House as a bachelor  His sister  Rose Cleveland  moved into the White House and acted as hostess for the first two years of his administration  121  In 1885 the daughter of Cleveland s friend Oscar Folsom visited him in Washington  122 Frances Folsom was a student at Wells College  when she returned to school  President Cleveland received her mother s permission to correspond with her  122  They were soon engaged to be married  122  On June 2  1886  Cleveland married Frances Folsom in the Blue Room at the White House  123  He was the second president to marry while in office  and the only president to have a wedding in the White House  124  This marriage was unusual because Cleveland was the executor of Oscar Folsom s estate and had supervised Frances  upbringing after her father s death  but the public did not take exception to the match  125  At twenty one years old  Frances Folsom Cleveland remains the youngest First Lady  and the public soon warmed to her beauty and warm personality  126  The Clevelands had five children  Ruth  1891 1904

Republicans to vote against him  Lamar s nomination was confirmed by the narrow margin of 32 to 28  127  Chief Justice Morrison Waite died a few months later  and Cleveland nominated Melville Fuller to his seat on April 30  1888  Cleveland had previously offered to nominate Fuller to the Civil Service Commission  but Fuller had declined to leave his Chicago law practice  Fuller accepted the Supreme Court nomination  and the Senate Judiciary Committee spent several months examining the little known nominee  The Senate confirmed the nomination 41 to 20  128  129  Other judicial appointments Cleveland appointed a total of 45 federal judges  In addition to his four Supreme Court appointments  these included two judges to the United States circuit courts  nine judges to the United States Courts of Appeals and 30 judges to the United States district courts  Because Cleveland served terms both before and after Congress eliminated the circuit courts in favor of the Courts of Appeals  he is one of only two presidents to have appointed judges to both bodies  The other  Benjamin Harrison  was in office at the time that the change was made  Thus  all of Cleveland s appointments to the circuit courts were made in his first term  and all of his appointments to the Courts of Appeals were made in his second  Election of 1888 and return to private life Defeated by Harrison Cleveland Thurman campaign poster Main article  United States presidential election  1888 The debate over tariff reduction continued into the 1888 presidential campaign  130  The Republicans nominated Benjamin Harrison of Indiana for president and Levi P  Morton of New York for vice president  Cleveland was easily renominated at the Democratic convention in St  Louis  131  Vice President Hendricks died in 1885  so the Democrats chose Allen G  Thurman of Ohio to be Cleveland s running mate  131  The Republicans campaigned heavily on the tariff issue  turning out protectionist voters in the important industrial states of the North  130  Further  the Democrats in New York were divided over the gubernatorial candidacy of David B  Hill  weakening Cleveland s support in that swing state  132  As in 1884  the election focused on the swing states of New York  New Jersey  Connecticut  and Indiana  Unlike that year  when Cleveland triumphed in all four  in 1888 he won only two  losing his home state of New York by 14 373 votes  133  More notoriously  the Republicans were victorious in Indiana  largely as the result of fraud  134  Republican victory in that state  where Cleveland lost by just 2 348 votes  was sufficient to propel Harrison to victory  despite his loss of the nationwide popular vote  133  Cleveland continued his duties diligently until the end of the term and began to look forward to return to private life  135  Private citizen for four years As Frances Cleveland left the White House  she told a staff member   Now  Jerry  I want you to take good care of all the furniture and ornaments in the house  for I want to find everything just as it is now  when we come back again   When asked when she would return  she responded   We are coming back four years from today   136  In the meantime  the Clevelands moved to New York City where Cleveland took a position with the law firm of Bangs  Stetson  Tracy  and MacVeigh  a predecessor to the present day firm Davis Polk  amp  Wardwell  137  Cleveland s income with the firm was not high  but neither were his duties especially onerous  138  While they lived in New York  the Clevelands  first child  Ruth  was born in 1891  139  The Harrison administration worked with Congress to pass the McKinley Tariff and the Sherman Silver Purchase Act  two policies Cleveland deplored as dangerous to the nation s financial health  140  At first he refrained from criticizing his successor  but by 1891 Cleveland felt compelled to speak out  addressing his concerns in an open letter to a meeting of reformers in New York  141  The  silver letter  thrust Cleveland s name back into the spotlight just as the 1892 election was approaching  142  Election of 1892 Main article  United States presidential election  1892 Democratic nomination Cleveland s stature as an ex president and recent pronouncements on the monetary issues made him a leading contender for the Democratic nomination  143  His leading opponent was David B  Hill  who was by that time a Senator for New York  144  Hill united the anti Cleveland elements of the Democratic party silverites  protectionists  and Tammany Hall but was unable to create a coalition large enough to deny Cleveland the nomination  144  Despite some desperate maneuvering by Hill  Cleveland was nominated on the first ballot at the convention in Chicago  145  For vice president  the Democrats chose to balance the ticket with Adlai E  Stevenson of Illinois  a silverite  146  Although the Cleveland forces preferred Isaac P  Gray of Indiana for vice president  they accepted the convention favorite  147  As a supporter of using greenbacks and Free Silver to inflate the currency and alleviate economic distress in the rural districts  Stevenson balanced the ticket headed by Cleveland  the hard money  gold standard supporter  148  Campaign against Harrison Results of the 1892 election The Republicans re nominated President Harrison  making the 1892 election a rematch of the one four years earlier  Unlike the turbulent and controversial elections of 1876  1884 and 1888  the 1892 election was  according to Cleveland biographer Allan Nevins   the cleanest  quietest  and most creditable in the memory of the post war generation   149  in part because Harrison s wife  Caroline  was dying of tuberculosis  150  Harrison did not personally campaign  and Cleveland followed suit out of sympathy to his political rival as not to exploit Mrs  Harrison s illness  The issue of the tariff had worked to the Republicans  advantage in 1888  but the revisions of the past four years had made imported goods so expensive that now many voters shifted to the reform position  151  Many westerners  traditionally Republican voters  defected to James Weaver  the candidate of the new Populist Party  Weaver promised Free Silver  generous veterans  pensions  and an eight hour work day  152  Finally  the Tammany Hall Democrats adhered to the national ticket  allowing a united Democratic party to carry New York  153  The result was a victory for Cleveland by wide margins in both the popular and electoral votes  and it was Cleveland s third consecutive popular vote plurality  154  Second term as president  1893 1897  Economic panic and the silver issue Cleveland s humiliation by Gorman and the sugar trust Shortly after Cleveland s second term began  the Panic of 1893 struck the stock market  and he soon faced an acute economic depression  155  The panic was worsened by the acute shortage of gold that resulted from the free coinage of silver  and Cleveland called Congress into session early to deal with the problem  156  The debate over the coinage was as heated as ever  but the effects of the panic had driven more moderates to support repealing the free coinage provisions of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act  156  Even so  the silverites rallied their following at a convention in Chicago  and the House of Representatives debated for fifteen weeks before passing the repeal by a considerable margin  157  In the Senate  the repeal of free coinage was equally contentious  but Cleveland convinced enough Democrats to stand by him that they  along with eastern Republicans  formed a 48 37 majority  158  With the passage of the repeal  the Treasury s gold reserves were restored to safe levels  159  At the time the repeal seemed a minor setback to silverites  but it marked the beginning of the end of silver as a basis for American currency  160  Tariff reform Having succeeded in reversing the Harrison administration s silver policy  Cleveland sought next to reverse the effects of the McKinley tariff  What would become the Wilson Gorman Tariff Act was introduced by West Virginian Representative William L  Wilson in December 1893  161  After lengthy debate  the bill passed the House by a considerable margin  162  The bill proposed moderate downward revisions in the tariff  especially on raw materials  163  The shortfall in revenue was to be made up by an income tax of two percent on income above  4 000 163   US 103 thousand in present terms 36    The bill was next considered in the Senate  where opposition was stronger  164  Cleveland faced opposition from key Democrats led by Arthur Pue Gorman of Maryland  who insisted on more protection for their states  industries than the Wilson bill allowed  165  Morgan and Hill voted partly out of a personal enmity toward Cleveland  164  By the time the bill passed the Senate  it had more than 600 amendments attached that nullified most of the reforms  166  The Sugar Trust in particular lobbied for changes that favored it at the expense of the consumer  167  Cleveland was outraged with the final bill  and denounced it as a disgraceful product of the control of the Senate by trusts and business interests  168  Even so  he believed it was an improvement over the McKinley tariff and allowed it to become law without his signature  163  John T  Morgan  Senator from Alabama  opposed Cleveland on Free Silver  the tariff  and the Hawaii treaty  saying of Cleveland that  I hate the ground that man walks on   169  Labor unrest The Panic of 1893 had damaged labor conditions across the United States  and the victory of anti silver legislation worsened the mood of western laborers  170  A group of workingmen led by Jacob S  Coxey began to march east toward Washington  D C  to protest Cleveland s policies  170  This group  known as Coxey s Army  agitated in favor of a national roads program to give jobs to workingmen  and a weakened currency to help farmers pay their debts  170  By the time they reached Washington  only a few hundred remained  and when they were arrested the next day for walking on the grass of the United States Capitol  the group scattered  170  Coxey s Army was never a threat to the government  but it showed a growing dissatisfaction in the West with Eastern monetary policies  171  Pullman Strike The Pullman Strike had a significantly greater impact than Coxey s Army  A strike began against the Pullman Company over low wages and twelve hour workdays  and sympathy strikes  led by American Railway Union leader Eugene V  Debs  soon followed  172  By June 1894  125 000 railroad workers were on strike  paralyzing the nation s commerce  173  Because the railroads carried the mail  and because several of the affected lines were in federal receivership  Cleveland believed a federal solution was appropriate  174  Cleveland obtained an injunction in federal court  and when the strikers refused to obey it  he sent in federal troops to Chicago and 20 other rail centers  175   If it takes the entire army and navy of the United States to deliver a postcard in Chicago   he proclaimed   that card will be delivered   176  Most governors supported Cleveland except Democrat John P  Altgeld of Illinois  who became his bitter foe in 1896  Leading newspapers of both parties applauded Cleveland s actions  but the use of troops hardened the attitude of organized labor toward his administration  177  Foreign policy  1893 1897 Hawaii  I suppose that right and justice should determine the path to be followed in treating this subject  If national honesty is to be disregarded and a desire for territorial expansion or dissatisfaction with a form of government not our own ought to regulate our conduct  I have entirely misapprehended the mission and character of our government and the behavior which the conscience of the people demands of their public servants   Cleveland s message to Congress on the Hawaiian question  December 18  1893  178  When Cleveland took office he faced the question of Hawaiian annexation  In his first term  Cleveland had supported free trade with Hawai i and accepted an amendment that gave the United States a coaling and naval station in Pearl Harbor  114  In the intervening four years  Honolulu businessmen of European and American ancestry had denounced Queen Liliuokalani as a tyrant who rejected constitutional government  in early 1893 they overthrew her  set up a republican government under Sanford B  Dole  and sought to join the United States  179  The Harrison administration had quickly agreed with representatives of the new government on a treaty of annexation and submitted it to the Senate for approval  179  Five days after taking office on March 9  1893  Cleveland withdrew the treaty from the Senate and sent former Congressman James Henderson Blount to Hawai i to investigate the conditions there  180  Cleveland agreed with Blount s report  which found the populace to be opposed to annexation  180  Liliuokalani initially refused to grant amnesty as a condition of her reinstatement  saying that she would either execute or banish the current government in Honolulu  and Dole s government refused to yield their position  181  By December 1893  the matter was still unresolved  and Cleveland referred the issue to Congress  181  In his message to Congress  Cleveland rejected the idea of annexation and encouraged the Congress to continue the American tradition of non intervention  see excerpt at right   178  The Senate  under Democratic control but hostile to Cleveland  produced the Morgan Report  which contradicted Blount s findings and found the overthrow was a completely internal affair  182  Cleveland dropped all talk of reinstating the Queen  and went on to recognize and maintain diplomatic relations with the new Republic of Hawaii  183  Venezuela  crisis with Britain Oil painting of Grover Cleveland  painted in 1899 by Anders Zorn Closer to home  Cleveland adopted a broad interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine that did not simply forbid new European colonies  but declared an American interest in any matter within the hemisphere  184  When Britain and Venezuela disagreed over the boundary between the latter nation and the colony of British Guiana  Cleveland and Secretary of State Richard Olney protested  185  British prime minister Lord Salisbury and the British ambassador to Washington  Julian Pauncefote misjudged the importance the American government placed on the dispute  prolonging the crisis before ultimately accepting the American demand for arbitration  186  187  A tribunal convened in Paris in 1898 to decide the matter  and in 1899 awarded the bulk of the disputed territory to British Guiana  188  By standing with a Latin American nation against the encroachment of a colonial power  Cleveland improved relations with the United States  southern neighbors  but the cordial manner in which the negotiations were conducted also made for good relations with Britain  189  Cancer In the midst of the fight for repeal of Free Silver coinage in 1893  Cleveland sought the advice of the White House doctor  Dr  O Reilly  about soreness on the roof of his mouth and a crater like edge ulcer with a granulated surface on the left side of Cleveland s hard palate  Samples of the tumor were sent anonymously to the army medical museum  The diagnosis was not a malignant cancer  but instead an epithelioma  190  Cleveland decided to have surgery secretly  to avoid further panic that might worsen the financial depression  191  The surgery occurred on July 1  to give Cleveland time to make a full recovery in time for the upcoming Congressional session  192  Under the guise of a vacation cruise  Cleveland and his surgeon  Dr  Joseph Bryant  left for New York  The surgeons operated aboard the yacht Oneida as it sailed off Long Island  193  The surgery was conducted through the president s mouth  to avoid any scars or other signs of surgery  194  The team  sedating Cleveland with nitrous oxide and ether  successfully removed parts of his upper left jaw and hard palate  194  The size of the tumor and the extent of the operation left Cleveland s mouth disfigured  195  During another surgery  Cleveland was fitted with a hard rubber dental prosthesis that corrected his speech and restored his appearance  195  A cover story about the removal of two bad teeth kept the suspicious press placated  196  Even when a newspaper story appeared giving details of the actual operation  the participating surgeons discounted the severity of what transpired during Cleveland s vacation  195  In 1917  one of the surgeons present on the Oneida  Dr  William W  Keen  wrote an article detailing the operation  197  Cleveland enjoyed many years of life after the tumor was removed  and there was some debate as to whether it was actually malignant  Several doctors  including Dr  Keen  stated after Cleveland s death that the tumor was a carcinoma  197  Other suggestions included ameloblastoma 198  or a benign salivary mixed tumor  also known as a pleomorphic adenoma   199  In the 1980s  analysis of the specimen finally confirmed the tumor to be verrucous carcinoma  200  a low grade epithelial cancer with a low potential for metastasis  190  Administration

of Agriculture Julius S  Morton 1893 1897 Supreme Court appointments The objections of Senator David B  Hill defeated two of Cleveland s Supreme Court nominees  Cleveland s trouble with the Senate hindered the success of his nominations to the Supreme Court in his second term  In 1893  after the death of Samuel Blatchford  Cleveland nominated William B  Hornblower to the Court  201  Hornblower  the head of a New York City law firm  was thought to be a qualified appointee  but his campaign against a New York machine politician had made Senator David B  Hill his enemy  201  Further  Cleveland had not consulted the Senators before naming his appointee  leaving many who were already opposed to Cleveland on other grounds even more aggrieved  201  The Senate rejected Hornblower s nomination on January 15  1894  by a vote of 30 to 24  201  Cleveland continued to defy the Senate by next appointing Wheeler Hazard Peckham another New York attorney who had opposed Hill s machine in that state  202  Hill used all of his influence to block Peckham s confirmation  and on February 16  1894  the Senate rejected the nomination by a vote of 32 to 41  202  Reformers urged Cleveland to continue the fight against Hill and to nominate Frederic R  Coudert  but Cleveland acquiesced in an inoffensive choice  that of Senator Edward Douglass White of Louisiana  whose nomination was accepted unanimously  202  Later  in 1896  another vacancy on the Court led Cleveland to consider Hornblower again  but he declined to be nominated  203  Instead  Cleveland nominated Rufus Wheeler Peckham  the brother of Wheeler Hazard Peckham  and the Senate confirmed the second Peckham easily  203  States admitted to the Union In Cleveland s first term  no new states had been admitted in more than a decade  owing to Congressional Democrats  reluctance to admit states that they believed would send Republican members  When Harrison took office  he and the Republican Congress admitted six states   North Dakota  South Dakota  Montana  Washington  Idaho  and Wyoming   all of which were expected to send Republican delegations  Utah  however  was believed to be Democratic  This  combined with uncertainty about Mormon polygamy  disavowed in 1890   led it to be excluded from the new states  When Cleveland won election to a second term  he and the Democratic majority in the 53rd United States Congress passed an Enabling Act in 1894 that permitted Utah to apply for statehood  204  Utah joined the Union on January 4  1896  1896 election and retirement Cleveland in 1903 at age 66 by Frederick Gutekunst Cleveland s agrarian and silverite enemies gained control of the Democratic party in 1896  repudiated his administration and the gold standard  and nominated William Jennings Bryan on a Silver Platform  205  206  Cleveland silently supported the Gold Democrats  third party ticket that promised to defend the gold standard  limit government  and oppose high tariffs  but declined to accept their nomination for a third term  207  The party won only 100 000 votes in the general election  and William McKinley  the Republican nominee  triumphed easily over Bryan  208  Agrarians would later nominate Bryan again in 1900  but in 1904 the conservatives  with Cleveland s support  regained control of the Democratic Party and nominated Alton B  Parker  209  After leaving the White House on March 4  1897  Cleveland lived in retirement at his estate  Westland Mansion  in Princeton  New Jersey  210  For a time he was a trustee of Princeton University  and was one of the majority of trustees who preferred Dean West s plans for the Graduate School and undergraduate living over those of Woodrow Wilson  then president of the university  211  Cleveland consulted occasionally with President Theodore Roosevelt  1901 1909   but was financially unable to accept the chairmanship of the commission handling the Coal Strike of 1902  212  Cleveland still made his views known in political matters  In a 1905 article in The Ladies Home Journal  Cleveland weighed in on the women s suffrage movement  writing that  sensible and responsible women do not want to vote  The relative positions to be assumed by men and women in the working out of our civilization were assigned long ago by a higher intelligence   213  Cleveland s health had been declining for several years  and in the autumn of 1907 he fell seriously ill  214  In 1908  he suffered a heart attack and died  214  His last words were  I have tried so hard to do right   215  He is buried in the Princeton Cemetery of the Nassau Presbyterian Church  Honors and memorials Cleveland on the  1000 bill In his first term in office  Cleveland sought a summer house to escape the heat and smells of Washington  D C   but needed to remain near the capital  Acting in secret  he located a house  Oak View  or Oak Hill   in a rural upland part of the District of Columbia  and bought it in 1886  Although he sold Oak View upon leaving the White House  the first time   the area became known as Cleveland Park  which name it still bears  The Clevelands are depicted in local murals  216  Grover Cleveland Hall at Buffalo State College in Buffalo  New York  Cleveland Hall houses the offices of the college president  vice presidents  and other administrative functions and student services  Cleveland was a member of the first board of directors of the then Buffalo Normal School  217 Grover Cleveland Middle School in his birthplace  Caldwell  New Jersey  was named for him  as is Grover Cleveland High School in Buffalo  New York  and the town of Cleveland  Mississippi  Mount Cleveland  a volcano in Alaska  is also named after him  218  Cleveland s portrait was on the U S   1000 bill of series 1928 and series 1934  He also appeared on the first few issues of the  20 Federal Reserve Notes from 1914  Since he was both the 22nd and 24th president  he will be featured on two separate dollar coins to be released in 2012 as part of the Presidential  1 Coin Act of 2005  In 2006  Free New York  a nonprofit and nonpartisan research group  began raising funds to purchase the former Fairfield Library in Buffalo  New York and transform it into the Grover Cleveland Presidential Library  amp  Museum  219  Notes   Blum  527   Jeffers  8 12  Nevins  4 5  Beito and Beito   McFarland  11 56   Gould  passim   a b Tugwell
