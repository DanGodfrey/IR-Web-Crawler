of the United States  They consist of the Army  Navy  Marine Corps  Air Force  and Coast Guard  6  The United States has a strong tradition of civilian control of the military  The President is the overall head of the military  and helps form military policy with the United States Department of Defense  DoD   a federal executive department  acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out  The DoD is headed by the Secretary of Defense  who is a civilian and Cabinet member  The Secretary of Defense is second in the military s chain of command  just below the President  and serves as the principal assistant to the President in all matters related to the Department of Defense  7  To coordinate military action with diplomacy  the President has an advisory National Security Council headed by a National Security Advisor  Both the President and Secretary of Defense are advised by a seven member Joint Chiefs of Staff  which includes the head of each of Department of Defense service branches as well as the chief of the National Guard Bureau  Leadership is provided by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  8  The Commandant of the Coast Guard is not a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  All of the branches work together during operations and joint missions  under the Unified Combatant Commands  under the authority of the Secretary of Defense with the exception of the Coast Guard  The Coast Guard falls under the administration of the Department of Homeland Security and receives its operational orders from the Secretary of Homeland Security  The Coast Guard may be transferred to the Department of the Navy by the President or Congress during a time of war  9  All five armed services are among the seven uniformed services of the United States  the others are the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps  From the time of its inception the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States  A sense of national unity and identity was forged out of the victorious Barbary Wars  as well as the War of 1812  Even so  the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force and not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established  The National Security Act of 1947  adopted following World War II and during the onset of the Cold War  created the modern U S  military framework  the Act merged previously Cabinet level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment  renamed the Department of Defense in 1949   headed by the Secretary of Defense  and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council  The U S  military is one of the largest militaries in terms of number of personnel  It draws its manpower from a large pool of paid volunteers  although conscription has been used in the past in various times of both war and peace  it has not been used since 1972  As of 2011  the United States spends about  550 billion annually to fund its military forces  4  and appropriates approximately  160 billion to fund Overseas Contingency Operations  Put together  the United States constitutes roughly 43 percent of the world s military expenditures  The U S  armed forces as a whole possess large quantities of advanced and powerful equipment  along with widespread placement of forces around the world  giving them significant capabilities in both defense and power projection  Contents 1 History 2 Budget 3 Personnel 3 1 Personnel in each service 3 2 Personnel stationing 3 2 1 Overseas 3 2 2 Within the United States 3 3 Types of personnel 3 3 1 Enlisted 3 3

Military history of the United States The history of the United States Armed Forces dates to 1775  even before the Declaration of Independence marked the establishment of the United States  The Continental Army  Continental Navy  and Continental Marines were created in close succession by the Second Continental Congress in order to defend the new nation against the British Empire in the American Revolutionary War  These forces demobilized in 1784 after the Treaty of Paris ended the War for Independence  The Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784  although the founding of the Army is celebrated as occurring on 14 June 1775  The 1787 adoption of the Constitution gave the Congress the power to  raise and support armies    provide and maintain a navy   and to  make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces   as well as the power to declare war and gave the President of the United States the responsibility of being the military s commander in chief  Rising tensions at various times with Britain and France the ensuing Quasi War and War of 1812 quickened the development of the United States Navy  established 13 October 1775  and the United States Marine Corps  established 10 November 1775   The United States Coast Guard dates its origin to the founding of the Revenue Cutter Service on 4 August 1790  that service merged with the United States Life Saving Service in 1915 to establish the Coast Guard  The United States Air Force was established as an independent service on 18 September 1947  it traces its origin to the formation of the Aeronautical Division  U S  Signal Corps in 1907 and was part of the U S  Army before becoming an independent service  The reserve branches formed a military strategic reserve during the Cold War  to be called into service in case of war  10  11  12 Time Magazine writer Mark Thompson has suggested that with the Global War on Terrorism  the reserves deployed as a single force with the active branches and America no longer has a strategic reserve  13  14  15   edit  Budget Main article  Military budget of the United States U S  military spending from 1910 to 2007  adjusted for inflation to 2003 dollars  The large spike represents World War II spending  US defense spending by GDP percentage 1910 to 2007  The United States has the largest defense budget in the world  In fiscal year 2010  the Department of Defense has a base budget of  533 8 billion  An additional  130 0 billion was requested for  Overseas Contingency Operations  in the War on Terrorism  and over the course of the year  an additional  33 billion in supplemental spending was added to Overseas Contingency Operations funding  4  16  17  Outside of direct Department of Defense spending  the United States spends another  218 262 billion each year on other defense related programs  such as Veterans Affairs  Homeland Security  nuclear weapons maintenance  and the State Department  By service   225 2 billion was allocated for the Army   171 7 billion for the Navy and Marine Corps   160 5 billion for the Air Force and  106 4 billion for defense wide spending  18  By function   154 2 billion was requested for personnel   283 3 billion for operations and maintenance   140 1 billion for procurement   79 1 billion for research and development   23 9 billion for military construction  and  3 1 billion for family housing  19  In fiscal year 2009  major defense programs also saw continued funding   4 1 billion was requested for the next generation fighter  F 22 Raptor  which will roll out an additional twenty planes for FY 2009   6 7 billion was requested for the F 35 Lightning II  which is still in development  Sixteen planes will be built as part of the funding  The Future Combat System program is expected to see  3 6 billion for its development  A total of  12 3 billion was requested for missile defense  which includes Patriot CAP  PAC 3 and SBIRS High systems   720 million was also included for a third missile defense site in Europe   4 2 billion was also requested to continue the aircraft carrier replacement program  With the addition of AFRICOM   389 million was requested to develop and maintain the new command  20  Historically  defense related spending in the United States is at its highest inflation adjusted level since World War II  Per capita spending is at approximately the same inflation adjusted level as the peak of the late 1980s Cold War military build up and the 1968 peak of the Vietnam War  In his Fiscal Year 2011 budget  President Obama has proposed a 4  increase in Department of Defense spending  followed by a 9  decrease in FY 2012  with funding remaining level in subsequent years  4  Loren Thompson has blamed the  vast sums of money  squandered on cutting edge technology projects that were then canceled on short sighted political operatives who lack a long term perspective in setting requirements  The result is that the number of items bought under a given program are cut  The total development costs of the program are divided over fewer platforms  making the per unit cost seem higher and so the numbers are cut again and again in a death spiral  21  Critical parts of the Obama future years plan are the cost containment measures provided by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Energy policy of the Obama administration as health care and fuel costs are the two fastest growing parts of the defense budget  22  23   edit  Personnel Active duty U S  military personnel from 1950 to 2003  The two peaks correspond to the Korean War and the Vietnam War  As of 30 September 2010  1 430 895 people were on active duty 24  in the military  with an additional 848 000 people in the seven reserve components  3  It is an all volunteer military  but conscription through the Selective Service System can be enacted by the request of the President and the approval of Congress  All males aged 18 through 25 who are living in the U S  are required to register with the Selective Service for a potential future draft  The United States military is the second largest in the world  after the People s Liberation Army of China  and has troops deployed around the globe  In early 2007  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates proposed to the President to increase the overall size of the Army and Marine Corps to meet the needs of the War on Terrorism  25  Current plans are to increase the Army to 547 400 and the Marine Corps to 202 000 by 2012  The expansion will cost a total of  90 7 billion between 2009 and 2013 as the Navy and Air Force undergo a limited force reduction  26  In addition  in 2009  Gates proposed increasing the size of the Army by 22 000 troops in order to reduce fatigue from multiple trips overseas  and to compensate for troops who are in recovery away from their units  citation needed  The Fiscal Year 2011 Department of Defense budget request 27  plan calls for an active military end strength of 1 406 000  an increase of 77 500 from the 2007 baseline as a result of increments in the Army  65 000 more troops  and Marine Corps  27 100 more troops  strength and decrements in the Navy  13 300 less troops  and Air Force  1 300 less troops  strength  As in most militaries  members of the U S  Armed Forces hold a rank  either that of officer  warrant  or enlisted  to determine seniority and eligibility for promotion  Those who have served are known as veterans  Rank names may be different between services  but they are matched to each other by their corresponding paygrade  28  Officers who hold the same rank or paygrade are distinguished by their date of rank to determine seniority  29  Officers who serve in certain positions of office of importance set by law  30  outrank all other officers in active duty of the same rank and paygrade  regardless of their date of rank  29  The failure of the educational systems in the United States may force the armed forces to seek math and science qualified recruits elsewhere  such as through accelerated citizenship for foreign nationals  31  Currently only one in four Americans of the proper age meet the moral  academic and physical standards for military service  32   edit  Personnel in each service As of May 2009 33  Female numbers as of 30 September 2009 34  Component Military Enlisted

United States military deployments  edit  Overseas As of 31 December 2010  U S  Armed Forces were stationed in 150 countries  37  Some of the largest contingents are the 103 700 in Afghanistan  the 52 440 in Germany  see list   the 35 688 in Japan  USFJ   the 28 500 in Republic of Korea  USFK   the 9 660 in Italy  and the 9 015 in the United Kingdom respectively  These numbers change frequently due to the regular recall and deployment of units  Altogether  77 917 military personnel are located in Europe  141 in the former Soviet Union  47 236 in East Asia and the Pacific  3 362 in North Africa  the Near East  and South Asia  1 355 in sub Saharan Africa and 1 941 in the Western Hemisphere excepting the United States itself   edit  Within the United States Including U S  territories and ships afloat within territorial waters As of 31 December 2009  a total of 1 137 568 personnel were on active duty within the United States and its territories  including 84 461 afloat   24  The vast majority  941 629 of them  were stationed at various bases within the Contiguous United States  There were an additional 37 245 in Hawaii and 20 450 in Alaska  84 461 were at sea  2 972 in Guam  and 179 in Puerto Rico   edit  Types of personnel  edit  Enlisted Service members of the United States at an American football event  L R  U S  Marine Corps  U S  Air Force  U S  Navy and U S  Army personnel  Prospective service members are often recruited from high school or college  the target age being those ages 18 to 28  With the permission of a parent or guardian  applicants can enlist at the age of 17 and participate in the Delayed Entry Program  DEP   In this program  the applicant is given the opportunity to participate in locally sponsored military related activities  which can range from sports to competitions  each recruiting station DEP program will vary   led by recruiters or other military liaisons  After enlistment  new recruits undergo Basic Training  also known as boot camp in the Navy  Coast Guard and Marines   followed by schooling in their primary Military Occupational Specialty  MOS  or rating at any of the numerous training facilities around the world  Each branch conducts basic training differently  For example  Marines send all non infantry MOS s to an infantry skills course known as Marine Combat Training prior to their technical schools  while Air Force Basic Military Training graduates attend Technical Training and are awarded an Air Force Specialty Code  AFSC  at the apprentice  3  skill level  The terms for this vary greatly  all non infantry Army recruits undergo Basic Combat Training  BCT   followed by Advanced Individual Training  AIT   while all combat arms recruits go to OSUT  one station unit training which combines basic and AIT  while the Navy send its recruits to Recruit Training and then to  A  schools to earn a rating  The Coast Guard s recruits attend basic training and follow with an  A  school to earn a rating  Initially  recruits without higher education or college degrees will hold the pay grade of E 1  and will be elevated to E 2 usually soon after the completion of Basic Training  Different services have different incentive programs for enlistees  such as higher initial ranks for college credit and referring friends who go on to enlist as well  Participation in DEP is one way recruits can achieve rank before their departure to Basic Training  There are several different authorized pay grade advancement requirements in each junior enlisted rank category  E 1 to E 3   which differ by service  Enlistees in the Army can attain the initial pay grade of E 4  Specialist  with a full four year degree  but the highest initial entry pay grade is usually E 3  Members of the Army Band program can expect to enter service at the grade of E 4   Promotion through the junior enlisted ranks occurs upon attaining a specified number of years of service  which can be waived by the Soldiers chain of command   a specified level of technical proficiency  and or maintenance of good conduct  Promotion can be denied with reason   edit  Non commissioned officers With very few exceptions  becoming a non commissioned officer  NCO  in the United States military is accomplished by progression through the lower enlisted ranks  However  unlike promotion through the lower enlisted tier  promotion to NCO is generally competitive  NCO ranks begin at E 4 or E 5  depending upon service  and are generally attained between three and six years of service  Junior NCOs function as first line supervisors and squad leaders  training the junior enlisted in their duties and guiding their career advancement  While considered part of the non commissioned officer corps by law  senior non commissioned officers  SNCOs  referred to as Chief Petty Officers in the Navy and Coast Guard  or staff non commissioned officers in the Marine Corps  perform duties more focused on leadership rather than technical expertise  Promotion to the SNCO ranks  E 7 through E 9  E 6 through E 9 in the Marine Corps  is highly competitive  Personnel totals at the pay grades of E 8 and E 9 are limited by federal law to 2 5 percent and 1 percent of a service s enlisted force  respectively  SNCOs act as leaders of small units and as staff  Some SNCOs manage programs at headquarters level and a select few wield responsibility at the highest levels of the military structure  Most unit commanders have a SNCO as an enlisted advisor  All SNCOs are expected to mentor junior commissioned officers as well as the enlisted in their duty sections  The typical enlistee can expect to attain SNCO rank after 10 to 16 years of service  Each of the five services employs a single Senior Enlisted Advisor at departmental level  This individual is the highest ranking enlisted member within his her respective service and functions as the chief advisor to the service secretary  service chief of staff  and Congress on matters concerning the enlisted force  These individuals carry responsibilities and protocol requirements equivalent to three star general and flag officers  They are as follows  Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman Sergeant Major of the Army Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard  edit  Warrant officers Additionally  all services except for the Air Force have an active warrant officer corps  Above the rank of Warrant Officer One  these officers may also be commissioned  but usually serve in a more technical and specialized role within units  More recently though they can also serve in more traditional leadership roles associated with the more recognizable officer corps  With one notable exception  helicopter and fixed wing pilots in the U S  Army   these officers ordinarily have already been in the military often serving in senior NCO positions in the field in which they later serve as a Warrant Officer as a technical expert  Most Army pilots have served some enlisted time  It is also possible to enlist  complete basic training  go directly to the Warrant Officer Candidate school at Fort Rucker  Alabama  and then on to flight school  Warrant officers in the U S  military garner the same customs and courtesies as commissioned officers  They may attend the Officer s club  receive a command and are saluted by junior warrant officers and all enlisted service members  The Air Force ceased to grant warrants in 1959 when the grades of E 8 and E 9 were created  Most non flying duties performed by warrant officers in other services are instead performed by senior NCOs in the Air Force   edit  Commissioned officers There are five common ways to receive a commission as an officer in one of the branches of the U S  military  although other routes are possible   Reserve Officers  Training Corps  ROTC  Officer Candidate School  OCS   This can be through active duty OCS academies  or  in the case of the National Guard  through state run academies  Service academies  United States Military Academy at West Point  New York  United States Naval Academy at Annapolis  Maryland  United States Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs  Colorado  the United States Coast Guard Academy at New London  Connecticut  and the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point  New York   Direct commission  civilians who have special skills that are critical to sustaining military operations and supporting troops may receive direct commissions  These officers occupy leadership positions in the following areas  law  medicine  dentistry  pharmacy  nurse corps  intelligence  supply logistics transportation  engineering  public affairs  chaplain corps  oceanography  and others  Battlefield commission  Under certain conditions  enlisted personnel who have skills that separate them from their peers can become officers by direct commissioning of a commander so authorized to grant them  This type of commission is rarely granted and is reserved only for the most exceptional enlisted personnel  it is done on an ad hoc basis  typically only in wartime  No direct battlefield commissions have been awarded since the Vietnam War  The Air Force and Navy do not employ this commissioning path  Limited Duty Officer  Due to the highly technical nature of some officer billets  the Navy employs a system of promoting proven senior enlisted members to the ranks of commissioned officers  They fill a need that is similar to  but distinct from that filled by Warrant Officers  to the point where their accession is through the same school   While Warrant Officers remain technical experts  LDOs take on the role of a generalist  like that of officers commissioned through more traditional sources  LDOs are limited  not by their authority  but by the types of billets they are allowed to fill  However  in recent times  they have come to be used more and more like their more traditional counterparts  Officers receive a commission assigning them to the officer corps from the President  with the consent of the Senate   To accept this commission  all officers must take an oath of office  Through their careers  officers usually will receive further training at one or a number of the many staff colleges  Company grade officers in pay grades O 1 through O 3  known as  junior  officers in the Navy and Coast Guard  function as leaders of smaller units or sections of a unit  typically with an experienced SNCO assistant and mentor  Field grade officers in pay grades O 4 through O 6  known as  senior  officers in the Navy and Coast Guard  lead significantly larger and more complex operations  with gradually more competitive promotion requirements  General officers  or flag officers in the Navy and Coast Guard  serve at the highest levels and oversee major portions of the military mission   edit  Five star ranking Main article  Five star rank These are ranks of the highest honor and responsibility in the armed forces  but they are almost never given during peacetime service and have only been held by a very few officers during wartime  General of the Army Fleet Admiral General of the Air Force No corresponding rank exists for the Marine Corps or the Coast Guard  As with three  and four star ranks  Congress is the approving authority for a five star rank confirmation  The rank of General of the Armies is considered senior to General of the Army  but was never held by active duty officers at the same time as persons who held the rank of General of the Army  It has been held by two people  John J  Pershing who received the rank in 1919 after World War I  and George Washington who received it posthumously in 1976 as part of the American Bicentennial celebrations  Pershing  appointed to General of the Armies in active duty status for life  was still alive at the time of the first five star appointments during World War II  and was thereby acknowledged as superior in grade by seniority to any World War II era Generals of the Army  George Washington s appointment by Public Law 94 479 to General of the Armies of the United States was established by law as having  rank and precedence over all other grades of the Army  past or present   making him not only superior to Pershing  but superior to any grade in the United States Army in perpetuity  In the Navy  the theoretically corresponding rank to General of the Armies is Admiral of the Navy  It was never held by active duty officers at the same time as persons who held the rank of Fleet Admiral  George Dewey is the only person to have ever held this rank  After the establishment of the rank of Fleet Admiral in 1944  the Department of the Navy specified that the rank of Fleet Admiral was to be junior to the rank of Admiral of the Navy  However  since Dewey died in 1917 before the establishment of the rank of Fleet Admiral  the six star rank status has not been totally confirmed   edit  Order of precedence Under current Department of Defense regulation  the various components of the Armed Forces have a set order of seniority  Examples of the use of this system include the display of service flags  placement of Soldiers  Marines  Sailors  and Airmen in formation  etc  When the United States Coast

States Marine Corps  39  the Marine Corps takes precedence over the Navy due to previous inconsistencies in the Navy s birth date  39  The Marine Corps has recognized its observed birth date on a more consistent basis  39  The Second Continental Congress established the Navy on 13 October 1775 39  and the Marine Corps on 10 November 1775  39  The Navy did not officially recognize 13 October 1775 as its birth date until 1972 when  then Chief of Naval Operations  Admiral Elmo Zumwalt authorized it to be observed as such  39   edit  See also Military of the United States portal Awards and
