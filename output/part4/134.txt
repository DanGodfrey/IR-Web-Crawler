a Nordic European island country in the North Atlantic Ocean  on the Mid Atlantic Ridge  9  The country has a population of about 320 000 and a total area of 103 000 km2  40 000 sq mi   10  The capital and the largest city is Reykjav k  11  with the surrounding areas in the southwestern region of the country being home to two thirds of the country s population  Iceland is volcanically and geologically active  The interior mainly consists of a plateau characterised by sand fields  mountains and glaciers  while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands  Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle  According to Landn mab k  the settlement of Iceland began in AD 874 when the chieftain Ing lfur Arnarson became the first permanent Norse settler on the island  12  Others had visited the island earlier and stayed over winter  Over the following centuries  Norsemen settled Iceland  bringing with them slaves of Gaelic origin  From 1262 to 1918 Iceland was part of the Norwegian and later the Danish monarchies  Until the 20th century  the Icelandic population relied largely on fisheries and agriculture  Industrialisation of the fisheries and Marshall Aid brought prosperity in the years after World War II  In 1994  Iceland became party to the European Economic Area  which made it possible for the economy to diversify into economic and financial services  Iceland has a free market economy with relatively low taxes compared to other OECD countries  13  while maintaining a Nordic welfare system providing universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens  14  In recent years  Iceland has been one of the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world  In 2011  it was ranked as the 14th most developed country in the world by the United Nations  Human Development Index  3  and the fourth most productive country per capita  15  In 2008  political unrest occurred as the nation s entire banking system systemically failed  Icelandic culture is founded upon the nation s Norse heritage  Most Icelanders are descendants of Norse  particularly from Western Norway  and Gaelic settlers  Icelandic  a North Germanic language  is closely related to Faroese and some West Norwegian dialects  The country s cultural heritage includes traditional Icelandic cuisine  poetry  and the medieval Icelanders  sagas  Currently  Iceland has the smallest population among NATO members and is the only one with no standing army  Contents 1 History 1 1 Settlement and the Commonwealth

Settlement of Iceland  Icelandic Commonwealth  and Christianisation of Iceland Ing lfr Arnarson  the first permanent Norwegian settler in Iceland One theory suggests the first people to have visited Iceland were members of a Hiberno Scottish mission or hermits  also known as Papar  who came in the 8th century  though no archaeological discoveries support this hypothesis  The monks are supposed to have left with the arrival of Norsemen  who systematically settled in the period c  870 930  Recently archeologists have found the ruins of a cabin in Hafnir on the Reykjanes peninsula  close to Keflav k Airport   Carbon dating reveals that the cabin was abandoned between 770 and 880  suggesting that someone had come to Iceland well before 874  16  The first known permanent Norse settler was Ing lfur Arnarson  who built his homestead in Reykjav k in the year 874  Ing lfur was followed by many other emigrant settlers  largely Norsemen and their Irish slaves  By 930  most arable land had been claimed and the Althing  a legislative and judiciary parliament  was initiated to regulate the Icelandic Commonwealth  Christianity was adopted c  999 1000 The Commonwealth lasted until 1262 when the political system devised by the original settlers proved unable to cope with the increasing power of Icelandic chieftains  17   sv r  a replica of an old fishing outpost outside of Bolungarv k

Era led to the signing of the Old Covenant in 1262  which brought Iceland under the Norwegian crown  Possession of Iceland passed to Denmark Norway around 1380  when the kingdoms of Norway  Denmark and Sweden were united in the Kalmar Union  In the ensuing centuries  Iceland became one of the poorest countries settled by Europeans  Infertile soil  volcanic eruptions  and an unforgiving climate made for harsh life in a society where subsistence depended almost entirely on agriculture  The Black Death swept Iceland in 1402 04 and 1494 95  18  the first time killing as much as 50  to 60  of the population  and 30  to 50  in the second  19  Around the middle of the 16th century  King Christian III of Denmark began to impose Lutheranism on all his subjects  J n Arason  the last Catholic bishop of H lar  was beheaded in 1550 along with two of his sons  The country subsequently became fully Lutheran  Lutheranism has since remained the dominant religion  In the 17th and 18th centuries  Denmark imposed harsh trade restrictions on Iceland  while pirates from several countries raided its coasts  20  21  A great smallpox epidemic in the 18th century killed around a third of the population  22  23  In 1783 the Laki volcano erupted  with devastating effects  24  The years following the eruption  known as the Mist Hardships  Icelandic  M  uhar indin   saw the death of over half of all livestock in the country  with ensuing famine in which around a quarter of the population died  25   edit  Independence movement 1814 1918 J n Sigur sson  leader of the Icelandic independence movement See also  Icelandic independence movement and Fj lnismenn In 1814  following the Napoleonic Wars  Denmark Norway was broken up into two separate kingdoms via the Treaty of Kiel  Iceland  however  remained a Danish dependency  Throughout the 19th century  the country s climate continued to grow worse  resulting in mass emigration to the New World  particularly Manitoba in Canada  About 15 000 out of a total population of 70 000 left  26  However  a new national consciousness had arisen  inspired by romantic and nationalist ideas from mainland Europe  An Icelandic independence movement arose in the 1850s under the leadership of J n Sigur sson  riding on the burgeoning nationalism in the country inspired by the Fj lnismenn and other Danish educated Icelandic intellectuals  In 1874  Denmark granted Iceland a constitution and limited home rule  which was expanded in 1904   edit  Kingdom of Iceland 1918 1944 See also  Kingdom of Iceland and Iceland during World War II HMS Berwick led the British invasion of Iceland  The Danish Icelandic Act of Union  an agreement with Denmark signed on 1 December 1918 and valid for 25 years  recognised Iceland as a fully sovereign state in a personal union with the King of Denmark The Government of Iceland established an embassy in Copenhagen  However  it requested that Denmark should handle Icelandic foreign policy  Danish embassies around the world would display two coats of arms and two flags  those of the Kingdom of Denmark and those of the Kingdom of Iceland  During World War II  Iceland joined Denmark in asserting neutrality  After the German occupation of Denmark on 9 April 1940  the Althing declared that the Icelandic Government should assume the Danish king s duties  taking control of foreign affairs and other matters previously handled by Denmark  A month later  British Armed Forces occupied Iceland in order to stop the nation siding with the now occupied Denmark  In 1941  the occupation of Iceland was taken over by the United States so that Britain could use its troops elsewhere  On 31 December 1943  the Act of Union agreement expired after 25 years  Beginning on 20 May 1944  Icelanders voted in a four day plebiscite on whether to terminate the personal union with the King of Denmark and establish a republic  The vote was 97  in favour of ending the union and 95  in favour of the new republican constitution  27  Iceland formally became a republic on 17 June 1944  with Sveinn Bj rnsson as the first President   edit  1945   2003 See also  Cod Wars British and Icelandic vessels

its forces on 30 September 2006  The immediate post war period was followed by substantial economic growth  driven by industrialisation of the fishing industry and the Marshall Plan programme  through which Icelanders received the most aid per capita of any European country  at USD 209  with the Netherlands a distant second at USD 109   28  29  The 1970s were marked by the Cod Wars   several

entirely south of the Arctic Circle  which passes through the small Icelandic island of Gr msey off the main island s northern coast  The country lies between latitudes 63  and 67  N  and longitudes 25  and 13  W  Though Iceland is nearer to Greenland  North America  than mainland Europe  the island is generally included in Europe for cultural reasons  Geologically the island is part of both continental plates  The closest bodies of land are Greenland  287 km  178 mi   and the Faroe Islands  420 km  261 mi    The closest distance to the mainland of Europe is 970 km  603 mi   to Norway   Iceland is the world s 18th largest island  and Europe s second largest island following Great Britain  The main island is 101 826 km2  39 315 sq mi   but the entire country is 103 000 km2  39 768 5 sq mi  in size  of which 62 7  is tundra  There are thirty minor islands in Iceland  including the lightly populated island of Gr msey and the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago  Lakes and glaciers cover 14 3

kuls rl n is the deepest lake  at 248 m  814 ft   33  Geologically  Iceland is a part of the Mid Atlantic Ridge  the ridge along which the oceanic crust spreads and forms new oceanic crust  In addition  this part of the mid ocean ridge is located atop a mantle plume causing Iceland to be subaerial  Iceland marks the boundary between both the Eurasian Plate and the North American Plate since it has been created by rifting  and accretion through volcanism  along the Mid Atlantic Ridge   where the two plates meet  34  Many fjords punctuate its 4 970 km long coastline  which is also where most settlements are situated  The island s interior  the Highlands of Iceland  is a cold and uninhabitable combination of sand and mountains  The major towns are the capital of Reykjav k  along with its outlying towns of K pavogur  Hafnarfj r ur and Gar ab r  Reykjanesb r  where the international airport is located  and Akureyri  in northern Iceland  The island of Gr msey on the Arctic Circle contains the northernmost habitation of Iceland  35  Iceland has three national parks  Vatnaj kull National Park  Sn fellsj kull National Park  and  ingvellir National Park  36  Iceland  as seen from

the Iceland hotspot and the Mid Atlantic Ridge  which runs right through it  This location means that the island is highly geologically active with many volcanoes  notably Hekla  Eldgj   Her ubrei  and Eldfell  37  The volcanic eruption of Laki in 1783 1784 caused a famine that killed nearly a quarter of the island s population  38  the eruption caused dust clouds and haze to appear over most of Europe and parts of Asia and Africa for several months afterward  39  Iceland has many geysers  including Geysir  from which the English word is derived  and the famous Strokkur  which erupts every 5 10 minutes  After a phase of inactivity  Geysir started erupting again after a series of earthquakes in 2000  Geysir has since then grown more quiet and does not erupt often  With the widespread availability of geothermal power  and the harnessing of many rivers and waterfalls for hydroelectricity  most residents have inexpensive hot water and home heat  The island itself is composed primarily of basalt  a low silica lava associated with effusive volcanism as has occurred also in Hawaii  Iceland  however  has a variety of volcanic types  Composite   amp  Fissure   many producing more evolved lavas such as rhyolite and andesite  Iceland has hundreds of volcanoes within approx  30 volcanic systems active 40  Surtsey  one of the youngest islands in the world  is part of Iceland  Named after Surtr  it rose above the ocean in a series of volcanic eruptions between 8 November 1963 and 5 June 1968  35  Only scientists researching the growth of new life are allowed to visit the island  41  On 21 March 2010  a volcano in Eyjafjallaj kull in the south of Iceland erupted for the first time since 1821  forcing 600 people to flee their homes  42  Further eruptions on 14 April forced hundreds of people to abandon their homes  43  The resultant cloud of volcanic ash brought major disruption to air travel across Europe  44  Another large eruption occurred on 21 May 2011  This time it was the Gr msv tn volcano  located under the thick ice of one of Europe s largest glaciers  the Vatnaj kull  Gr msv tn is one of Iceland s most active volcanoes and this eruption was much more powerful than the 2010 Eyjafjallaj kull activity  Debris was thrown 20 km  12 43 mi  up in the atmosphere  creating a large ash cloud that  for a while  was thought to pose a danger to jet aircraft over a wide area of northern Europe   edit  Climate Eyjafjallaj kull glacier  one of the smallest glaciers of Iceland Main article  Climate of Iceland The climate of Iceland s coast is subpolar oceanic  The warm North Atlantic Current ensures generally higher annual temperatures than in most places of similar latitude in the world  Regions in the world with similar climate include the Aleutian Islands  the Alaska Peninsula  and Tierra del Fuego  although these regions are closer to the equator  Despite its proximity to the Arctic  the island s coasts remain ice free through the winter  Ice incursions are rare  the last having occurred on the north coast in 1969  45  There are some variations in the climate between different parts of the island  Generally speaking  the south coast is warmer  wetter and windier than the north  The Central Highlands are the coldest part of the country  Low lying inland areas in the north are the most arid  Snowfall in winter is more common in the north than the south  The highest air temperature recorded was 30 5  C  86 9  F  on 22 June 1939 at Teigarhorn on the southeastern coast  The lowest was  38  C   36 4  F  on 22 January 1918 at

only native land mammal when humans arrived was the Arctic Fox  50  which came to the island at the end of the ice age  walking over the frozen sea  On rare occasions  bats which have been carried to the island with the winds can be seen  but they are not able to breed there  Polar bears have also shown up through the history  yet they are just visitors  and no Icelandic populations exist  51  There are no native or free living reptiles or amphibians on the island  52  An Icelandic sheep Phytogeographically  Iceland belongs to the Arctic province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom  According to the World Wide Fund for Nature  the territory of Iceland belongs to the ecoregion of Iceland boreal birch forests and alpine tundra  citation needed  Approximately three quarters of the island are barren of vegetation  plant life consists mainly of grassland which is regularly grazed by livestock  The most common tree native to Iceland is the Northern Birch  Betula pubescens   which formerly formed forest over much of Iceland along with Aspen  Populus tremula   Rowan  Sorbus aucuparia  and Common Juniper  Juniperus communis  and other smaller trees  When the island was first settled  it was extensively forested  In the late 12th century  slendingab k  Ari the Wise described it as  forested from mountain to sea shore   53  Permanent human settlement greatly disturbed the isolated ecosystem of thin  volcanic soils and limited species diversity  The forests were heavily exploited over the centuries for firewood and timber  50 Deforestation  climatic deterioration during the Little Ice Age and overgrazing by sheep  causing a loss of critical topsoil due to erosion  Today  many farms have been abandoned and three quarters of Iceland s hundred thousand square kilometres are affected by soil erosion  eighteen thousand square kilometres so seriously as to be useless  53  Only a few small birch stands now exist in isolated reserves  The planting of new forests has increased the number of trees  but does not compare to the original forests  Some of the planted forests include introduced species  50  The animals of Iceland include the Icelandic sheep  cattle  chicken  goat  the sturdy Icelandic horse  and the Icelandic Sheepdog  Many varieties of fish live in the ocean waters surrounding Iceland  and the fishing industry is a main contributor to Iceland s economy  accounting for more than half of the country s total exports  Wild mammals include the Arctic Fox  mink  mice  rats  rabbits and reindeer  Polar bears occasionally visit the island  travelling on icebergs from Greenland  In June 2008  two polar bears arrived in the same month  54  Birds  especially seabirds  are a very important part of Iceland s animal life  Puffins  skuas  and

with Marc Wall  Economic Minister Counselor at the US embassy in Tokyo  Jun Yamashita of the Japanese Fisheries Agencies  however  rejected a proposal to suggest to Iceland to reduce the number of killed fin whales to a more reasonable number  58   edit  Politics The political system of Iceland  Main article  Politics of Iceland Iceland has a left right multi party system  The biggest parties are the Social Democratic Alliance  Samfylkingin   the centre right Independence Party  Sj lfst  isflokkurinn  and the Left Green Movement  Vinstrihreyfingin   gr nt frambo    Other political parties with seats in the Althing are the centrist Progressive Party  Frams knarflokkurinn  and The Movement  Hreyfingin   Many other parties exist on the municipal level  most of which run only locally in a single municipality   edit  Government The Althing  Iceland s national parliament  in Reykjav k Iceland is a representative democracy and a parliamentary republic  The modern parliament  Al ingi  English  Althing   was founded in 1845 as an advisory body to the Danish monarch  It was widely seen as a re establishment of the assembly founded in 930 in the Commonwealth period and suspended in 1799  Consequently   it is arguably the world s oldest parliamentary democracy   59  It currently has 63 members  elected for a maximum period of four years  60  The president is elected by popular vote for a term of four years  with no term limit  The government and local councils are elected separately from the presidential elections every four years  61  Stj rnarr  i   the seat of the executive branch of Iceland s government The president of Iceland is a largely ceremonial head of state and serves as a diplomat  but can block a law voted by the parliament and put it to a national referendum  The current president is  lafur Ragnar Gr msson  The head of government is the prime minister  currently J hanna Sigur ard ttir  who  together with the cabinet  is responsible for executive government  The cabinet is appointed by the president after a general election to the Althing  however  the appointment is usually negotiated by the leaders of the political parties  who decide among themselves after discussions which parties can form the cabinet and how its seats are to be distributed  under the condition that it has a majority support in the Althing  Only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves in a reasonable time does the president exercise this power and appoint the cabinet himself or herself  This has not happened since the republic was founded in 1944  but in 1942 the regent of the country  Sveinn Bj rnsson who had been installed in that position by the Althing in 1941  did appoint a non parliamentary government  The regent had  for all practical purposes  the position of a president  and Sveinn in fact became the country s first president in 1944  The governments of Iceland have almost always been coalitions with two or more parties involved  as no single political party has received a majority of seats in the Althing during the republic  The extent of the political power possessed by the office of the president is disputed by legal scholars in Iceland  several provisions of the constitution appear to give the president some important powers but other provisions and traditions suggest differently  In 1980  Icelanders elected Vigd s Finnbogad ttir as president  the country s first directly elected female head of state  She retired from office in 1996   edit  Administrative divisions Main article  Administrative divisions of Iceland Iceland is divided into regions  constituencies  counties  and municipalities  There are eight regions which are primarily used for statistical purposes  the district court jurisdictions also use an older version of this division  9  Until 2003  the constituencies for the parliamentary elections were the same as the regions  but by an amendment to the constitution  they were changed to the current six constituencies  Reykjav k North and Reykjav k South  city regions   Southwest  four geographically separate suburban areas around Reykjav k   Northwest and Northeast  north half of Iceland  split   and  South  south half of Iceland  excluding Reykjav k and suburbs   The redistricting change was made in order to balance the weight of different districts of the country  since previously a vote cast in the sparsely populated areas around the country would count much more than a vote cast in the Reykjav k city area  The imbalance between districts has been reduced by the new system  but still exists  9  Regions of Iceland Constituencies of Iceland Counties of Iceland Iceland s 23 counties are  for the most part  historical divisions  Currently  Iceland is split up among 26 magistrates  s slumenn  singular s sluma ur  who represent government in various capacities  Among their duties are tax collection  administering bankruptcy declarations  and performing civil marriages  After a police reorganisation in 2007  which combined police forces in multiple counties  about half of them are in charge of police forces  9

has indicated that the majority of the male settlers were of Nordic origin while the majority of the women were of Gaelic origin  98  Iceland has extensive genealogical records dating back to the late 17th century and fragmentary records extending back to the Age of Settlement  The biopharmaceutical company deCODE genetics has funded the creation of a genealogy database which attempts to cover all of Iceland s known inhabitants  It sees the database  called  slendingab k  as a valuable tool for conducting research on genetic diseases  given the relative isolation of Iceland s population  The population of the island is believed to have varied from 40 000 60 000 in the period from initial settlement until the mid 19th century  During that time  cold winters  ashfall from volcanic eruptions  and bubonic plagues adversely affected the population several times  99  According to Bryson  1974   there were 37 famine years in Iceland between 1500 and 1804  100  The first census was carried out

less from Old Norse than the other Nordic languages  has preserved more verb and noun inflection  and has to a considerable extent developed new vocabulary based on native roots rather than borrowings from other languages  It is the only living language to retain the runic letter    The closest living language to Icelandic is Faroese  Icelandic Sign Language was officially recognised as a minority language in 2011  In education  its use for Iceland s deaf community is regulated by the National Curriculum Guide  English is widely spoken as a secondary language  Danish is also widely understood

Commission public opinion analysis over 85  of Icelanders found independence to be  very important  contrasted with the EU25 average of 53   and 47  for the Norwegians  and 49  for the Danes  116  Iceland is progressive in terms of lesbian  gay bisexual and transgendered  LGBT  matters  In 1996  the Icelandic parliament passed legislation to create registered partnerships for same sex couples  covering nearly all the rights and benefits of marriage  In 2006  by unanimous vote of the parliament  further legislation was passed  granting same sex couples the same rights as different sex couples in adoption  parenting and assisted insemination treatment  On 11 June 2010  the Icelandic parliament amended the marriage law  making it gender neutral and defining marriage as between two individuals  thereby legalising same sex marriage  The law took effect on 27 June 2010  117  The amendment to the law also means registered partnerships for same sex couples are now no longer possible

distinctive rendition of the Icelandic landscape by its painters can be linked to nationalism and the movement to home rule and independence  which was very active in this period  Contemporary Icelandic painting is typically traced to the work of   rarinn  orl ksson  who  following formal training in art in the 1890s in Copenhagen  returned to Iceland to paint and exhibit works from 1900 to his death in 1924  almost exclusively portraying the Icelandic landscape  Several other Icelandic men and women artists studied at Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts at that time  including  sgr mur J nsson  who together with   rarinn created a distinctive portrayal of Iceland s landscape in a romantic naturalistic style  Other landscape artists quickly followed in the footsteps of   rarinn and  sgr mur  These included J hannes Kjarval and J l ana Sveinsd ttir  Kjarval in particular is noted for the distinct techniques in the application of paint that he developed in a concerted effort to render the characteristic volcanic rock that dominates the Icelandic environment  Einar H konarson is an expressionistic and figurative painter who by some is considered to have brought the figure back into Icelandic painting  In the 1980s  many Icelandic artists worked with the subject of the new painting in their work  In the recent years artistic practice has multiplied  and the Icelandic
