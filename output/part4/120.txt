a major power in Africa  the Mediterranean Basin  the Middle East and the Muslim world  Covering an area of about 1 010 000 square kilometers  390 000 sq mi   Egypt is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north  the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast  the Red Sea to the east  Sudan to the south and Libya to the west  Egypt is one of the most populous countries in Africa and the Middle East  The great majority of its over 81 million people 3  live near the banks of the Nile River  in an area of about 40 000 square kilometers  15 000 sq mi   where the only arable land is found  The large areas of the Sahara Desert are sparsely inhabited  About half of Egypt s residents live in urban areas  with most spread across the densely populated centres of greater Cairo  Alexandria and other major cities in the Nile Delta  Monuments in Egypt such as the Giza pyramid complex and its Great Sphinx were constructed by its ancient civilization  Its ancient ruins  such as those of Memphis  Thebes  and Karnak and the Valley of the Kings outside Luxor  are a significant focus of archaeological study  The tourism industry and the Red Sea Riviera employ about 12  of Egypt s workforce  The economy of Egypt is one of the most diversified in the Middle East  with sectors such as tourism  agriculture  industry and service at almost equal production levels  In early 2011  Egypt underwent a revolution  which resulted in the ousting of President Hosni Mubarak after nearly 30 years in power  Presidential elections are scheduled for May 2012  Contents 1 Names 2 History 2 1 Pre historic

French Egypte  from Latin Aegyptus  from ancient Greek A gyptos             from earlier Linear B       a ku pi ti yo  The adjective aig pti   aig ptios was borrowed into Coptic as                 gyptios  kyptios  and from there into Arabic as      qub    back formed into     qub   whence English Copt  The Greek forms were borrowed from Late Egyptian  Amarna  Hikuptah  Memphis   a corruption of the earlier Egyptian name Hwt ka Ptah   wt k  pt    meaning  home of the ka  soul  of Ptah   the name of a temple to the god Ptah at Memphis  10 Strabo attributed the word to a folk etymology in

Semitic origin  directly cognate with other Semitic words for Egypt such as the Hebrew             Mitzr yim   literally meaning  the two straits   a reference to the dynastic separation of upper and lower Egypt   unreliable source   11  The word originally connoted  metropolis  or  civilization  and means  country   or  frontier land   The ancient Egyptian name of the country is Kemet  km t

There is evidence of rock carvings along the Nile terraces and in desert oases  In the 10th millennium BC  a culture of hunter gatherers and fishers replaced a grain grinding culture  citation needed  Climate changes and or overgrazing around 8000 BC began to desiccate the pastoral lands of Egypt  forming the Sahara  Early tribal peoples migrated to the Nile River where they developed a settled agricultural economy and more centralized society  15  By about 6000 BC a Neolithic culture rooted in the Nile Valley  16  During the Neolithic era  several predynastic cultures developed independently in Upper and Lower Egypt  The Badarian culture and the successor Naqada series are generally regarded as precursors to dynastic Egypt  The earliest known Lower Egyptian site  Merimda  predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years  Contemporaneous Lower Egyptian communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years  remaining culturally distinct  but maintaining frequent contact through trade  The earliest known evidence of Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions appeared during the predynastic period on Naqada III pottery vessels  dated to about 3200 BC  17  Ancient Egypt Main article  Ancient Egypt Giza Pyramids A unified kingdom was founded c  3150 BC by King Menes  leading to a series of dynasties that ruled Egypt for the next three millennia  Egyptian culture flourished during this long period and remained distinctively Egyptian in its religion  arts  language and customs  The first two ruling dynasties of a unified Egypt set the stage for the Old Kingdom period  c  2700 2200 BC   which constructed many pyramids  most notably the Third Dynasty pyramid of Djoser and the Fourth Dynasty Giza Pyramids  The Great Sphinx and the Pyramids of Giza  built during the Old Kingdom  are modern national icons that are at the heart of Egypt s thriving tourism industry  The First Intermediate Period ushered in a time of political upheaval for about 150 years  18  Stronger Nile floods and stabilization of government  however  brought back renewed prosperity for the country in the Middle Kingdom c  2040 BC  reaching a peak during the reign of Pharaoh Amenemhat III  A second period of disunity heralded the arrival of the first foreign ruling dynasty in Egypt  that of the Semitic Hyksos  The Hyksos invaders took over much of Lower Egypt around 1650 BC and founded a new capital at Avaris  They were driven out by an Upper Egyptian force led by Ahmose I  who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty and relocated the capital from Memphis to Thebes  The New Kingdom c  1550 1070 BC began with the Eighteenth Dynasty  marking the rise of Egypt as an international power that expanded during its greatest extension to an empire as far south as Tombos in Nubia  and included parts of the Levant in the east  This period is noted for some of the most well known Pharaohs  including Hatshepsut  Thutmose III  Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti  Tutankhamun and Ramesses II  The first historically attested expression of monotheism came during this period as Atenism  Frequent contacts with other nations brought new ideas to the New Kingdom  The country was later invaded and conquered by Libyans  Nubians and Assyrians  but native Egyptians eventually drove them out and regained control of their country  19  The Thirtieth Dynasty was the last native ruling dynasty during the Pharaonic epoch  It fell to the Persians in 343 BC after the last native Pharaoh  King Nectanebo II  was defeated in battle  Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt The Greek Ptolemaic queen Cleopatra VII and her son by Julius Caesar  Caesarion at the Temple of Dendera  Main articles  History of Ptolemaic Egypt and Egypt  Roman province  The Ptolemaic Kingdom was a powerful Hellenistic state  extending from southern Syria in the east  to Cyrene to the west  and south to the frontier with Nubia  Alexandria became the capital city and a center of Greek culture and trade  To gain recognition by the native Egyptian populace  they named themselves as the successors to the Pharaohs  The later Ptolemies took on Egyptian traditions  had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress  and participated in Egyptian religious life  20  21  The last ruler from the Ptolemaic line was Cleopatra VII  who committed suicide with her lover Mark Antony  after Caesar Augustus had captured them  The Ptolemies faced rebellions of native Egyptians often caused by an unwanted regime and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the decline of the kingdom and its annexation by Rome  Nevertheless Hellenistic culture continued to thrive in Egypt well after the Muslim conquest  Christianity was brought to Egypt by Saint Mark the Evangelist in the 1st century  22 Diocletian s reign marked the transition from the Roman to the Byzantine era in Egypt  when a great number of Egyptian Christians were persecuted  The New Testament had by then been translated into Egyptian  After the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451  a distinct Egyptian Coptic Church was firmly established  23  Arab and Ottoman Egypt Main articles  History of Muslim Egypt and History of Ottoman Egypt Selim I  1470 1520   conquered Egypt The Hanging Church of Cairo  first built in the 3rd or 4th century  is one of the most famous Coptic Churches in Egypt  The Byzantines were able to regain control of the country after a brief Persian invasion early in the 7th century  until 639 42  when Egypt was invaded and conquered by the Islamic Empire by the Muslim Arabs  When they defeated the Byzantine Armies in Egypt  the Arabs brought Sunni Islam to the country  Early in this period  Egyptians began to blend their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices  leading to various Sufi orders that have flourished to this day  22  These earlier rites had survived the period of Coptic Christianity  24  Muslim rulers nominated by the Islamic Caliphate remained in control of Egypt for the next six centuries  with Cairo as the seat of the Caliphate under the Fatimids  With the end of the Kurdish Ayyubid dynasty  the Mamluks  a Turco Circassian military caste  took control about AD 1250  By the late 13th century  Egypt linked the Red Sea  India  Malaya  and East Indies  25  They continued to govern the country until the conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman Turks in 1517  after which it became a province of the Ottoman Empire  The mid 14th century Black Death killed about 40  of the country s population  26  After the 15th century  the Ottoman invasion pushed the Egyptian system into decline  The defensive militarization damaged its civil society and economic institutions  25  The weakening of the economic system combined with the effects of plague left Egypt vulnerable to foreign invasion  Portuguese traders took over their trade  25  Egypt suffered six famines between 1687 and 1731  27  The 1784 famine cost it roughly one sixth of its population  28  Battle of the Pyramids  21 July 1798  by Fran ois Louis Joseph Watteau  Further information  French Campaign in Egypt and Syria  Ottoman Saudi War  Muhammad Ali s seizure of power  First Turko Egyptian War  Second Turko Egyptian War  and Khedivate of Egypt British admiral Codrington negotiating with Muhammad Ali Pasha in the latter s palace in Alexandria  Mosque of Muhammad Ali The brief French invasion of Egypt led by Napoleon Bonaparte began in 1798  The expulsion of the French in 1801 by Ottoman  Mamluk  and British forces was followed by four years of anarchy in which Ottomans  Mamluks  and Albanians    who were nominally in the service of the Ottomans wrestled for power  Out of this chaos  the commander of the Albanian regiment  Muhammad Ali  Kavalali Mehmed Ali Pasha  emerged as a dominant figure and in 1805 was acknowledged by the Sultan in Istanbul as his viceroy in Egypt  the title implied subordination to the Sultan but this was in fact a polite fiction  Ottoman power in Egypt was finished and Muhammad Ali  an ambitious and able leader  established a dynasty that was to rule Egypt until the revolution of 1952  In later years  the dynasty became a British puppet  29  His primary focus was military  he annexed Northern Sudan  1820 1824   Syria  1833   and parts of Arabia and Anatolia  but in 1841 the European powers  fearful lest he topple the Ottoman Empire itself  forced him to return most of his conquests to the Ottomans  but he kept the Sudan and his title to Egypt was made hereditary  A more lasting result of his military ambition is that it required him to modernize the country  Eager to adopt the military  and therefore industrial  techniques of the great powers  he sent students to the West and invited training missions to Egypt  He built industries  a system of canals for irrigation and transport  and reformed the civil service  29  The introduction in 1820 of long staple cotton  the Egyptian variety of which became notable  transformed its agriculture into a cash crop monoculture before the end of the century  The social effects of this were enormous  land ownership became concentrated and many foreigners arrived  shifting production towards international markets  29  British rule Main article  History of modern Egypt British rule lasted from 1882 when the British succeeded in defeating the Egyptian Army at Tel El Kebir in September and took control of the country  to the 1952 Egyptian revolution which made Egypt a republic and when British advisers were expelled  Muhammad Ali was succeeded briefly by his son Ibrahim  in September 1848   then by a grandson Abbas I  in November 1848   then by Said  in 1854   and Isma il  in 1863   Abbas I was cautious  Said and Ismail were ambitious developers  but they spent beyond their means  The Suez Canal  built in partnership with the French  was completed in 1869  The cost of this and other projects had two effects  it led to enormous debt to European banks  and caused popular discontent because of the onerous taxation it required  In 1875 Ismail was forced to sell Egypt s share in the canal to the British Government  Within three years this led to the imposition of British and French controllers who sat in the Egyptian cabinet  and   with the financial power of the bondholders behind them  were the real power in the Government   30  Local dissatisfaction with Ismail and with European intrusion led to the formation of the first nationalist groupings in 1879  with Ahmad Urabi a prominent figure  In 1882 he became head of a nationalist dominated ministry committed to democratic reforms including parliamentary control of the budget  Fearing a reduction of their control  the UK and France intervened militarily  bombarding Alexandria and crushing the Egyptian army at the battle of Tel el Kebir  31  They reinstalled Ismail s son Tewfik as figurehead of a de facto British protectorate  32  Female nationalists demonstrating in Cairo  1919 In 1914  the Protectorate was made official  and the title of the head of state  which had changed from pasha to khedive in 1867  was changed to sultan  to repudiate the vestigial suzerainty of the Ottoman sultan  who was backing the Central powers in World War I  Abbas II was deposed as khedive and replaced by his uncle  Hussein Kamel  as sultan  33  In 1906  the Dinshaway Incident prompted many neutral Egyptians to join the nationalist movement  After the First World War  Saad Zaghlul and the Wafd Party led the Egyptian nationalist movement to a majority at the local Legislative Assembly  When the British exiled Zaghlul and his associates to Malta on 8 March 1919  the country arose in its first modern revolution  The revolt led the UK government to issue a unilateral declaration of Egypt s independence on 22 February 1922  34  Kingdom Main article  Kingdom of Egypt The new government drafted and implemented a constitution in 1923 based on a parliamentary system  Saad Zaghlul was popularly elected as Prime Minister of Egypt in 1924  In 1936  the Anglo Egyptian Treaty was concluded  Continued instability due to remaining British influence and increasing political involvement by the king led to the dissolution of the parliament in a military coup d  tat known as the 1952 Revolution  The Free Officers Movement forced King Farouk to abdicate in support of his son Fuad  British military presence in Egypt lasted until 1954  35  Republic Main articles  Republic of Egypt  1953 1958  and United Arab Republic On 18 June 1953  the Egyptian Republic was declared  with General Muhammad Naguib as the first President of the Republic  Naguib was forced to resign in 1954 by Gamal Abdel Nasser   the real architect of the 1952 movement   and was later put under house arrest  Nasser assumed power as President in June  1956  British forces completed their withdrawal from the occupied Suez Canal Zone on 13 June 1956  He nationalized the Suez Canal on 26 July 1956  prompting the 1956 Suez Crisis  In the 1967 Six Day War  Israel invaded and occupied Egypt s Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip  which Egypt had occupied since the 1948 Arab Israeli War  Three years later President Nasser died and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat in 1970  Sadat switched Egypt s Cold War allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States  expelling Soviet advisors in 1972  He launched the Infitah economic reform policy  while clamping down on religious and secular opposition  In 1973  Egypt  along with Syria  launched the October War  a surprise attack against the Israeli forces occupying the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights  It was an attempt to regain part of the Sinai territory Israel had captured 6 years earlier  Sadat hoped to seize some territory through military force  and then regain the rest of the peninsula by diplomacy  The conflict sparked an international crisis between the US and the USSR  both of whom intervened  The second UN mandated ceasefire halted military action  While the war ended with a military stalemate  it presented Sadat with a political victory that later allowed him to regain the Sinai in return for peace with Israel  36  Sadat made a historic visit to Israel in 1977  which led to the 1979 peace treaty in exchange for Israeli withdrawal from Sinai  Sadat s initiative sparked enormous controversy in the Arab world and led to Egypt s expulsion from the Arab League  but it was supported by most Egyptians  37  A fundamentalist military soldier assassinated Sadat in Cairo in 1981  He was succeeded by Hosni Mubarak  In 2003  the Egyptian Movement for Change  popularly known as Kefaya  was launched to oppose the Mubarak regime and to establish democratic reforms and greater civil liberties  2011 revolution Main article  2011 Egyptian revolution Celebrations in Tahrir Square after Omar Suleiman s statement announcing Hosni Mubarak s resignation On 25 January 2011  widespread protests began against Mubarak s government  The objective of the protest was the removal of Mubarak from power  These took the form of an intensive campaign of civil resistance supported by a very large number of people and mainly consisting of continuous mass demonstrations  By 29 January it was becoming clear that Mubarak s government had lost control when a curfew order was ignored  and the army took a semi neutral stance on enforcing the curfew decree  Some protesters  a very small minority in Cairo  expressed views against what they deemed was foreign interference  highlighted by the then held view that the U S  administration had failed to take sides  as well as linking the administration with Israel  38  On 11 February 2011  Mubarak resigned and fled Cairo  Vice President Omar Suleiman announced that Mubarak had stepped down and that the Egyptian military would assume control of the nation s affairs in the short term  39  40   See also 2011 revolution   Jubilant celebrations broke out in Tahrir Square at the news  41  Mubarak may have left Cairo for Sharm el Sheikh the previous night  before or shortly after the airing of a taped speech in which Mubarak vowed he would not step down or leave  42  On 13 February 2011  the high level military command of Egypt announced that both the constitution and the parliament of Egypt had been dissolved  The parliamentary election was to be held in September  43  A constitutional referendum was held on 19 March 2011  On 28 Nov 2011  Egypt held its first parliamentary election since the previous regime had been in power  Turnout was high and there were no reports of irregularities or violence  although members of some parties broke the ban on campaigning at polling places by handing out pamphlets and banners  44  The flag As a result of their conditional independence from Great Britain in 1922  the Egyptian royal family issued a Royal Decree establishing a national flag  This first flag was a major step for Egypt  and its colors were green with a white crescent and three stars in the middle  The next version of the flag was established in 1958 by Presidential Decree  to incorporate aspects of Syria and Egypt  since they were merged into one country  the United Arab Republic  This new flag had three colors  red  white with two green stars  and black  The rectangular flag had a width of 1 3 the size of its length  The flag was changed once again in 1972  with an amendment to the law  This new flag had the stars removed  and replaced with a golden hawk  The hawk was replaced in 1984 by the golden eagle of Salah El Dine  the Ayubbid Sultan of the Crusades who ruled Egypt and Syria in the 12th century  This flag still waves over Egypt today  45  Flag of Egypt  1922 1953  Flag of Egypt  1953 1958  Flag of Egypt

s 30th largest country  In land area  it is about the same size as all Central America  47  twice the size of Spain  48  four times the size of the United Kingdom  49  and the combined size of the US states of Texas and California  50  It lies between latitudes 22  and 32 N  and longitudes 24  and 36 E  Nevertheless  due to the aridity of Egypt s climate  population centres are concentrated along the narrow Nile Valley and Delta  meaning that about 99  of the population uses only about 5 5  of the total land area  51  Egypt is bordered by Libya to the west  Sudan to the south  and by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the east  Egypt s important role in geopolitics stems from its strategic position  a transcontinental nation  it possesses a land bridge  the Isthmus of Suez  between Africa and Asia  traversed by a navigable waterway  the Suez Canal  that connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Indian Ocean by way of the Red Sea  Apart from the Nile Valley  the majority of Egypt s landscape is desert  Winds create prolific sand dunes that peak at more than 100 feet  30 m  high  Egypt includes parts of the Sahara Desert and of the Libyan Desert  These deserts that protected the Kingdom of the Pharaohs from western threats were referred to as the  red land  in ancient Egypt  Towns and cities include Alexandria  the second largest city  Aswan  Asyut  Cairo  the modern Egyptian capital

Climate Satellite image of Egypt Main article  Climate of Egypt Most of Egypt s rain falls in the winter months  52  South of Cairo  rainfall averages only around 2 to 5 mm  0 1 to 0 2 in  per year and at intervals of many years  On a very thin strip of the northern coast the rainfall can be as high as 410 mm  16 1 in   53  mostly between October and March  Snow falls on Sinai s mountains and some of the north coastal cities such as Damietta  Baltim  Sidi Barrany  etc  and rarely in Alexandria  Frost is also known in mid Sinai and mid Egypt  Temperatures average between 80  F  27  C  and 90  F  32  C  in summer  and up to 109  F  43  C  on the Red Sea coast  Winter temperatures average between 55  F  13  C  and 70  F  21  C   A steady wind from the northwest helps lower temperatures near the Mediterranean coast  The Khamaseen is a wind that blows from the south in spring  bringing sand and dust  and sometimes raises the temperature in the desert to more than 100  F  38  C   Prior to the construction of the Aswan Dam  the Nile flooded annually  colloquially The Gift of the Nile  replenishing Egypt s soil  This gave the country consistent harvest throughout the years  The potential rise in sea levels due to global warming could threaten Egypt s densely populated coastal strip and have grave consequences for the country s economy  agriculture and industry  Combined with growing demographic pressures  a significant rise in sea levels could turn millions of Egyptians into environmental refugees by the end of the century  according to some climate experts  54  Politics Main article  Politics of Egypt Egypt has been officially named a  Republic  since 18 June 1953  However  it has been under Emergency Law continually since 1967  with the exception of an 18 month break in 1980   55  clarification needed  Between 1981 and 2011  Egypt was ruled autocratically by Mohamed Hosni Mubarak  who came to power after the assassination of President Mohammed Anwar El Sadat  56 Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik was sworn in as Prime Minister on 29 January 2011  following the resignation of Ahmed Nazif  Since President Mubarak s resignation during the 2011 revolution  Egypt s de facto government has been the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces  chaired by Mohamed Hussein Tantawi  Although power is nominally organized under a multi party semi presidential system  whereby the executive power is theoretically divided between the President and the Prime Minister  in practice it has rested almost solely with the President who traditionally has been elected in single candidate elections for more than fifty years  Egypt has also held regular multi party parliamentary elections  The last presidential election  in which Mubarak won a fifth consecutive term  was held in September 2005  In 2009  Dr  Ali El Deen Hilal Dessouki  Media Secretary of the NDP  described Egypt as a  pharaonic  political system  and democracy as a  long term goal   Dessouki also stated that  the real center of power in Egypt is the military   57  In late February 2005  Mubarak announced in a surprise television broadcast that he had ordered the reform of the country s presidential election law  paving the way for multi candidate polls in the upcoming presidential election  For the first time since the 1952 movement  the Egyptian people had an apparent chance to elect a leader from a list of various candidates  The President said his initiative came  out of my full conviction of the need to consolidate efforts for more freedom and democracy   58  However  the new law placed restrictions on the candidates  designed to prevent well known politicians such as Ayman Nour from standing against Mubarak  and paved the road for his easy re election victory  59  After the 2005 presidential elections observers alleged government interference in the election process through fraud and vote rigging  and police brutality and violence by pro Mubarak supporters against opposition demonstrators  60  After the election  Mubarak imprisoned Ayman Nour  and the U S  government stated the  conviction of Mr  Nour  the runner up in Egypt s 2005 presidential elections  calls into question Egypt s commitment to democracy  freedom  and the rule of law   61  Most Egyptians were skeptical about the process of democratization and the intent of the election rules  Less than 25  of the country s 32 million registered voters  out of a population of more than 72 million  turned out for the 2005 elections  62  Thirty four constitutional changes voted on by parliament on 19 March 2007 prohibit parties from using religion as a basis for political activity  allow the drafting of a new anti terrorism law to replace the emergency legislation in place since 1981  authorize broad police powers of arrest and surveillance  give the president power to dissolve parliament and end judicial election monitoring  63  Opposition members of parliament abstained from voting on the proposed changes  Only 27  of registered voters turned out under heavy police presence and tight political control  It was officially announced on 27 March 2007 that 75 9  of those who participated in the referendum approved the constitutional amendments  The results were endorsed by the rump parliament  thus allowing the introduction of laws that curb the activity of opposition elements

 Human rights in Egypt See also  Sudanese refugees in Egypt Several local and international human rights organizations  including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch  have for many years criticized Egypt s human rights record as poor  In 2005  President Hosni Mubarak faced unprecedented public criticism when he clamped down on democracy activists challenging his rule  Some of the most serious human rights violations  according to HRW s 2006 report on Egypt  are routine torture  arbitrary detentions and trials before military and state security courts  72  Egypt has also been cited for discriminatory personal status laws governing marriage  custody and inheritance  which critics say put women at a disadvantage  Laws concerning Coptic Christians which place restrictions on church building and open worship have been recently eased  but major construction still requires Government approval  while sporadic attacks on Christians and churches continue  73  Intolerance of Bah   s

and illegal detention  The report alleges that Egypt has become an international center for torture  where other nations send suspects for interrogation  often as part of the War on Terror  The report calls on Egypt to bring its anti terrorism laws into accordance with international human rights statutes and on other nations to stop sending their detainees to Egypt  79  Egypt s foreign ministry quickly issued a rebuttal to this report  claiming that it was inaccurate and unfair  as well as causing deep offense  80  The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights  EOHR  is one of the longest standing bodies for the defence of human rights in Egypt  81  In 2003  the Government established the National Council for Human Rights  headquartered in Cairo and headed by former UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali who directly reports to the President  82  The council has come under heavy criticism by local activists  who contend it undermines human rights work in Egypt by serving as a propaganda tool for the Government to excuse its violations 83  and to give legitimacy to repressive laws such as the recently renewed Emergency Law  84  Egypt had announced in 2006 that it was in the process of abolishing the Emergency Law  85  but in March 2007  Mubarak approved several constitutional amendments to include  an anti terrorism clause that appears to enshrine sweeping police powers of arrest and surveillance   suggesting that the Emergency Law will remain for the long haul  86  According to the World Health Organization in 2008  an estimated 91 1  of Egypt s girls and

traditional Nile boat  Foreign direct investment  FDI  into Egypt has increased considerably in the past few years  exceeding  6 billion in 2006  due to the recent economic liberalization and privatization measures taken by minister of investment Mahmoud Mohieddin  Although one of the main obstacles still facing the Egyptian economy is the trickle down of the wealth to the average population  many Egyptians criticize their Government for higher prices of basic goods while their standards of living or purchasing power remains relatively stagnant  Corruption is often cited by Egyptians as the main impediment to further economic growth  90  91  92  The Government promises major reconstruction of the country s infrastructure  using money paid for the newly acquired third

and Christianity  and a new language  Arabic  and its spoken descendant  Egyptian Arabic  125  After two thousand years of occupation  three ideologies competed for the attention of newly independent Egyptians  ethno territorial Egyptian nationalism  secular Arab nationalism pan Arabism  and Islamism  Egyptian nationalism predates its Arab counterpart by many decades  having roots in the 19th century and becoming the dominant mode of expression of Egyptian anti colonial activists and intellectuals until the early 20th century  126  Arab nationalism reached a peak under Nasser but subsided under Sadat  meanwhile  the ideology espoused by Islamists such as the Muslim Brotherhood is present in small segments of the lower middle strata of Egyptian society  127  The work of early 19th century scholar Rifa a et Tahtawi led to the Egyptian Renaissance  marking the transition from Medieval to Early Modern Egypt  His work renewed interest in Egyptian antiquity and exposed Egyptian society to Enlightenment principles  Tahtawi co founded with education reformer Ali Mubarak a native Egyptology school that looked for inspiration to medieval Egyptian scholars  such as Suyuti and Maqrizi  who themselves studied the history  language and antiquities of Egypt  128  Egypt s renaissance peaked in the late 19th and early 20th centuries through the work of people like Muhammad Abduh
