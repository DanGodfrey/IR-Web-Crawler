extensive and the 25th most populous of the 50 United States  Its capital is Baton Rouge and largest city is New Orleans  Louisiana is the only state in the U S  with political subdivisions termed parishes  which are local governments equivalent to counties  The largest parish by population is East Baton Rouge Parish  and the largest by land area is Cameron Parish  Some Louisiana urban environments have a multicultural  multilingual heritage  being so strongly influenced by an admixture of 18th century French  Spanish  Native American  Indian  and African cultures that they are considered to be somewhat exceptional in the U S  Before the American influx and statehood at the beginning of the 19th century  the territory of current Louisiana State had been a Spanish and French colony  In addition  the pattern of development included importing numerous African slaves in the 18th century  with many from the same region of West Africa  thus concentrating their culture

Once part of the French Colonial Empire  the Louisiana Territory stretched from present day Mobile Bay to just north of the present day Canadian border  and included a small part of what is now southwestern Canada   edit  Geography Map of Louisiana Aerial view of Louisiana wetland habitats   edit  Topography Louisiana is bordered to the west by Texas  to the north by Arkansas  to the east by the state of Mississippi  and to the south by the Gulf of Mexico  The surface of the state may properly be divided into two parts  the uplands of the north  and the alluvial along the coast  The alluvial region includes low swamp lands  coastal marshlands and beaches  and barrier islands that cover about 20 000 square miles  52 000 km2   This area lies principally along the Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi River  which traverses the state from north to south for a distance of about 600 miles  1 000 km  and empties into the Gulf of Mexico  the Red River  the Ouachita River and its branches  and other minor streams  some of which are called bayous   The breadth of the alluvial region along the Mississippi is from 10 to 60 miles  15 to 100 km   and along the other rivers the alluvial region averages about 10 miles  15 km  across  The Mississippi River flows along a ridge formed by its own deposits  known as a levee   from which the lands decline toward a river beyond at an average fall of six feet per mile  3 m km   The alluvial lands along other streams present similar features  The higher and contiguous hill lands of the north and northwestern part of the state have an area of more than 25 000 square miles  65 000 km2   They consist of prairie and woodlands  The elevations above sea level range from 10 feet  3 m  at the coast and swamp lands to 50 and 60 feet  15 18 m  at the prairie and alluvial lands  In the uplands and hills  the elevations rise to Driskill Mountain  the highest point in the state at only 535 feet  163 m  above sea level  Besides the navigable waterways already named  there are the Sabine  Sah BEAN   forming the western boundary  and the Pearl  the eastern boundary  the Calcasieu  KAL cah shew   the Mermentau  the Vermilion  Bayou Teche  the Atchafalaya  a CHAF a LI a   the Boeuf  bow   Bayou Lafourche  the Courtableau  Bayou D Arbonne  the Macon  the Tensas  TEN saw   Amite River  the Tchefuncte  CHA Funk ta   the Tickfaw  the Natalbany  and a number of other smaller streams  constituting a natural system of navigable waterways  aggregating over 4 000 miles  6 400 km  long  The state also has political jurisdiction over the approximately 3 mile  4 8 km  wide portion of subsea land of the inner continental shelf in the Gulf of Mexico  Through a peculiarity of the political geography of the United States  this is substantially less than the 9 mile  14 km  wide jurisdiction of nearby states Texas and Florida  which  like Louisiana  have extensive Gulf coastlines  8  The southern coast of Louisiana in the United States is among the fastest disappearing areas in the world  Rising waters and erosion  both natural and man made  have led to the state losing a land mass equivalent to 30 football fields every day  And as the communities disappear  more and more people are leaving the region  9   edit  Climate Baton Rouge Climate chart  explanation  J F M A M J J A S O N D     5 9   62

example of a humid subtropical climate of all the Southcentral states  with long  hot  humid summers and short  mild winters  The subtropical characteristics of the state are due in large part to the influence of the Gulf of Mexico  which even at its farthest point is no more than 200 miles  320 km  away  Precipitation is frequent throughout the year  although the summer is slightly wetter than the rest of the year  There is a dip in precipitation in October  Southern Louisiana receives far more copious rainfall  especially during the winter months  Summers in Louisiana are hot and humid  with high temperatures from mid June to mid September averaging 90  F  32  C  or more and overnight lows averaging above 70  F  22  C   In the summer  the extreme maximum temperature is much warmer in the north than in the south  with temperatures near the Gulf of Mexico occasionally reaching 100  F  38  C   although temperatures above 95  F  35  C  are commonplace  In northern Louisiana  the temperatures reach above 105  F  41  C  in the summer  Temperatures are generally mildly warm in the winter in the southern part of the state  with highs around New Orleans  Baton Rouge  the rest of south Louisiana  and the Gulf of Mexico averaging 66  F  19  C   while the northern part of the state is mildly cool in the winter with highs averaging 59  F  15  C   The overnight lows in the winter average well above freezing throughout the state  with 46  F  8  C  the average near the Gulf and an average low of 37  F  3  C  in the winter in the northern part of the state  Louisiana does have its share of cold fronts  which frequently drop the temperatures below 20  F   8  C  in the northern part of the state  but almost never do so in the southern part of the state  Snow is not very common near the Gulf of Mexico  although those in the northern parts of the state can expect one to three snowfalls per year  with the frequency increasing northwards  Louisiana s highest recorded temperature is 114  F  46  C  in Plain Dealing on August 10  1936 while the coldest recorded temperature is  16  F   27  C  at Minden on February 13  1899  Louisiana is often affected by tropical cyclones and is very vulnerable to strikes by major hurricanes  particularly the lowlands around and in the New Orleans area  The unique geography of the region with the many bayous  marshes and inlets can make major hurricanes especially destructive  The area is also prone to frequent thunderstorms  especially in the summer  The entire state averages over 60 days of thunderstorms a year  more than any other state except Florida  Louisiana averages 27 tornadoes annually  some in part in 2010  The entire state is vulnerable to a tornado strike  with the extreme southern portion of the state slightly less so than the rest of the state  Tornadoes are much more common from January to March in the southern part of the state  and from February through March in the northern part of the state  10   edit  Hurricanes September 1  2008  Gustav made landfall along the Louisiana coast near Cocodrie in southeastern Louisiana  As late as August 31 it had been projected by the National Hurricane Center that the hurricane would remain at Category 3 or above on September 1  but in the event the center of Gustav made landfall as a strong Category 2 hurricane  1 mph below Category 3   and dropped to Category 1 soon after  11  As a result of NHC s forecasts there had been a massive evacuation of New Orleans amid warnings  for example from the city s mayor  Ray Nagin  that this would be the  storm of the century   12  potentially more devastating than Katrina almost exactly three years earlier  but these fears were not realised  Nevertheless  a significant number of deaths were caused by or attributed to Gustav  13  and around 1 5 million people were without power in Louisiana on September 1  14  September 24  2005  Rita  Category 3 at landfall  struck southwestern Louisiana  flooding many parishes and cities along the coast  including Cameron Parish  Lake Charles  and other towns  The storm s winds further weakened the damaged levees in New Orleans and caused renewed flooding in parts of the city  August 29  2005  Katrina  Category 3 at landfall  15  struck and devastated southeastern Louisiana  where it breached and undermined levees in New Orleans  causing 80  of the city to flood  Most people had been evacuated but the majority of the population became homeless  The city was virtually closed until October  It is estimated that more than two million people in the Gulf region were displaced by the hurricane  and that more than 1 500 fatalities resulted in Louisiana alone  A public outcry criticized governments at the local  state  and federal levels  citing that preparation and response was neither fast nor adequate  The effects of the hurricane scattered Louisiana residents across the country  Further information  Effect of Hurricane Katrina on Louisiana and Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Oct  3  2002  Lili  Category 1 at landfall  August 1992  Andrew  Category 3 at landfall  struck south central Louisiana  It killed four people  knocked out power to nearly 150 000 citizens  and destroyed hundreds of millions of dollars of crops in the state  August 1969  Camille  Category 5  caused a 23 4 ft  7 1 m   storm surge and killed 250 people  Although Camille officially made landfall in Mississippi and the worst impacts were felt there  it also had effects in Louisiana  New Orleans was spared the brunt of the storm and remained dry  with the exception of mild rain generated flooding in the most low lying areas  September 9  1965  Betsy  Category 3 at landfall  came ashore in Louisiana  causing massive destruction as the first hurricane in history to cause one billion dollars in damage  over ten billion in inflation adjusted USD   The storm hit New Orleans particularly hard by flooding approximately 35  of the city  including the Lower 9th Ward  Gentilly  and parts of Mid City   and pushing the death toll in the state to 76  June 1957  Audrey  Category 4  devastated southwest Louisiana  destroying or severely damaging 60 80 percent of the homes and businesses from Cameron to Grand Chenier  40 000 people were left homeless and more than 300 people in the state were killed  August 10  1856  Hurricane One  Category 4  made landfall at Last Island  Louisiana  The 25 mile  40 km  long barrier island resort community was devastated by being split into 5 separate islands  and over 200 people were killed   edit  Geology This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  The underlying strata of the state are of Cretaceous age and are covered by alluvial deposits of Tertiary and post Tertiary origin  A large part of Louisiana is the creation and product of the Mississippi River  It was originally covered by an arm of the sea  and has been built up by the silt carried down the valley by the great river  Near the coast  there are many salt domes  where salt is mined and oil is often found  Salt domes also exist in North Louisiana  Due both to extensive flood control measures along the Mississippi River and natural subsidence  Louisiana is now suffering the loss of coastal land area  State and federal government efforts to halt or reverse this phenomenon are underway  others are being sought  There is one bright spot  however  the Atchafalaya River is creating new delta land in the South Central portion of the state  This active delta lobe also indicates that the Mississippi is seeking a new path to the Gulf  Much engineering effort is devoted to keeping the river near its traditional route  as the state s economy and shipping depends on it   edit  Geographic

History of Louisiana  edit  Prehistory Louisiana was inhabited by Native Americans for many millennia before the arrival of Europeans in the 16th century  During the Middle Archaic period  Louisiana was the site of the earliest mound complex in North America and one of the earliest dated  complex constructions in the Americas  the Watson Brake site near present day Monroe  An 11 mound complex  it was built about 5400 BP  3500 BCE   18  The Middle Archaic sites of Caney and Frenchman s Bend have also been securely dated to 5600 5000 BP  demonstrating that seasonal hunter gatherers organized to build complex constructions in present day northern Louisiana  The Hedgepeth Site in Lincoln Parish is more recent  dated to 5200 4500 BP  19  Nearly 2 000 years later  Poverty Point  the largest and best known Late Archaic site in the state  was built  Modern day Epps developed near it  The Poverty Point culture may have hit its peak around 1500 BCE  making it the first complex culture  and possibly the first tribal culture in North America  20  It lasted until approximately 700 BCE  The Poverty Point culture was followed by the Tchefuncte and Lake Cormorant cultures of the Tchula period  local manifestations of Early Woodland period  The Tchefuncte culture were the first people in Louisiana to make large amounts of pottery  21  These cultures lasted until 200 CE  The Middle Woodland period starts in Louisiana with the Marksville culture in the southern and eastern part of the state 22  and the Fourche Maline culture in the northwestern part of the state  The Marksville culture takes its name from the Marksville Prehistoric Indian Site in Avoyelles Parish  Louisiana  These cultures were contemporaneous with the Hopewell cultures of Ohio and Illinois  and participated in the Hopewell Exchange Network  Trade with peoples to the southwest brought the bow and arrow 23  The first burial mounds were built at this time  24  Political power begins to be consolidated as the first platform mounds at ritual centers are constructed for the developing hereditary political and religious leadership  24  By 400 CE in the southern part of the state the Late Woodland period had begun with the Baytown culture and it was not all that much of a change in the cultural history of the area  Population increased dramatically and there is strong evidence of a growing cultural and political complexity  Many Coles Creek sites were erected over earlier Woodland period mortuary mounds  leading researchers to speculate that emerging elites were symbolically and physically appropriating dead ancestors to emphasize and project their own authority  25  The Mississippian period in Louisiana sees the emergence of the Plaquemine and the Caddoan Mississippian cultures  This period is when extensive maize agriculture is adopted  The Plaquemine culture in the lower Mississippi River Valley in western Mississippi and eastern Louisiana begins in 1200 CE and goes to about 1400 CE  Good examples of this culture are the Medora Site in West Baton Rouge Parish  Louisiana  and the Emerald Mound  Winterville and Holly Bluff sites in Mississippi  26  Plaquemine culture was contemporaneous with the Middle Mississippian culture in the Cahokia site near St  Louis  Missouri  This group is considered ancestral to the Natchez and Taensa Peoples  27  By 1000 CE in the northwestern part of the state the Fourche Maline culture had evolved into the Caddoan Mississippian culture  The Caddoan Mississippians covered a large territory  including what is now eastern Oklahoma  western Arkansas  northeast Texas  and northwest Louisiana  Archeological evidence that the cultural continuity is unbroken from prehistory to the present  and that the direct ancestors of the Caddo and related Caddo language speakers in prehistoric times and at first European contact and the modern Caddo Nation of Oklahoma is unquestioned today  28  Many current place names in the state  including Atchafalaya  Natchitouches  now spelled Natchitoches   Caddo  Houma  Tangipahoa  and Avoyel  as Avoyelles   are transliterations of those used in various Native American languages   edit  Exploration and colonization by Europeans Louisiana regions The first European explorers to visit Louisiana came in 1528 when a Spanish expedition led by Panfilo de Narv ez located the mouth of the Mississippi River  In 1542  Hernando de Soto s expedition skirted to the north and west of the state  encountering Caddo and Tunica groups  and then followed the Mississippi River down to the Gulf of Mexico in 1543  Then Spanish interest in Louisiana lay dormant  In the late 17th century  French and French Canadian expeditions  which included sovereign  religious and commercial aims  established a foothold on the Mississippi River and Gulf Coast  With its first settlements  France lay claim to a vast region of North America and set out to establish a commercial empire and French nation stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada  In 1682  the French explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle named the region Louisiana to honor France s King Louis XIV  The first permanent settlement  Fort Maurepas  at what is now Ocean Springs  Mississippi  near Biloxi   was founded by Pierre Le Moyne d Iberville  a French military officer from Canada  in 1699  By then the French had also built a small fort at the mouth of the Mississippi at a settlement they named La Balise  or La Balize    seamark  in French  By 1721 they built a 62 foot  19 m  wooden lighthouse type structure to guide ships on the river  29  The French colony of Louisiana originally claimed all the land on both sides of the Mississippi River and north to French territory in Canada  The following States were part of Louisiana  Louisiana  Mississippi  Arkansas  Oklahoma  Missouri  Kansas  Nebraska  Iowa  Illinois  Indiana  Michigan  Wisconsin  Minnesota  North Dakota  South Dakota  The settlement of Natchitoches  along the Red River in present day northwest Louisiana  was established in 1714 by Louis Juchereau de St  Denis  making it the oldest permanent European settlement in the Louisiana Purchase territory  The French settlement had two purposes  to establish trade with the Spanish in Texas  and to deter Spanish advances into Louisiana  Also  the northern terminus of the Old San Antonio Road  sometimes called El Camino Real  or Kings Highway  was at Natchitoches  The settlement soon became a flourishing river port and crossroads  giving rise to vast cotton kingdoms along the river  Over time  planters developed large plantations and built fine homes in a growing town  This became a pattern repeated in New Orleans and other places  French Acadians  who came to be known as Cajuns  settled the swamps of southern Louisiana  especially in the Atchafalaya Basin  Louisiana s French settlements contributed to further exploration and outposts  concentrated along the banks of the Mississippi and its major tributaries  from Louisiana to as far north as the region called the Illinois Country  around present day St  Louis  Missouri  See also  French colonization of the Americas Initially Mobile  Alabama  and Biloxi  Mississippi  functioned as the capital of the colony  Recognizing the importance of the Mississippi River to trade and military interests  France made New Orleans the seat of civilian and military authority in 1722  From then until the United States acquired the territory in the Louisiana Purchase on December 20  1803  France and Spain traded control of the region s colonial empire  In the 1720s  German immigrants settled along the Mississippi River in a region referred to as the German Coast  France ceded most of its territory to the east of the Mississippi to Great Britain in the aftermath of Britain s victory in the Seven Years  War or French and Indian War  as it is known in North America  It retained the area around New Orleans and the parishes around Lake Pontchartrain  The rest of Louisiana became a colony of Spain after the Seven Years  War by the Treaty of Fontainebleau of 1763  In 1765  during the period of Spanish rule  several thousand French speaking refugees from the region of Acadia  now Nova Scotia  New Brunswick  and Prince Edward Island  Canada  made their way to Louisiana after having been expelled from their homelands by the British during the French and Indian War  They settled chiefly in the southwestern Louisiana region now called Acadiana  The Spanish  eager to gain more Catholic settlers  welcomed the Acadian refugees  Cajuns descend from these Acadian refugees  Spanish Canary Islanders  called Isle os  emigrated from the Canary Islands of Spain to Louisiana under the Spanish crown between 1778 and 1783  In 1800  France s Napoleon Bonaparte reacquired Louisiana from Spain in the Treaty of San Ildefonso  an arrangement kept secret for two years   edit  Expansion of slavery In 1709  French financier Antoine Crozat obtained a monopoly of commerce in the French dominion of Louisiana that extended from the Gulf of Mexico to what is now Illinois   That concession allowed him to bring in a cargo of blacks from Africa every year   the British historian Hugh Thomas wrote  30  When France sold the Louisiana territory to the United States in 1803  it was soon accepted that enslaved Africans could be brought there as easily as they were brought to neighboring Mississippi though it violated U S  law to do so  31  Though Louisiana was  at the start of the 19th century  a small producer of sugar with a relatively small number of slaves  it soon became a big sugar producer after plantation owners purchased enslaved people who had been transported from Africa and then to South Carolina before being sold in Louisiana where plantation owners forced the captive labor to work at no pay on their growing sugar cane plantations  Despite demands by United States Rep  James Hillhouse and by the pamphleteer Thomas Paine to enforce existing federal law against slavery in the newly acquired territory   31  slavery prevailed because it was the source of great profits and the lowest cost labor  The last Spanish governor of the Louisiana territory wrote that  Truly  it is impossible for lower Louisiana to get along without slaves  and with the use of slaves  the colony had been  making great strides toward prosperity and wealth   31  Free woman of color with quadroon daughter  late 18th century collage painting  New Orleans  Forced slave labor was needed  said William C  C  Claiborne  Louisiana s first United States governor  because unforced white laborers  cannot be had in this unhealthy climate   32  Hugh Thomas wrote that Claiborne was unable to enforce the abolition of trafficking in human beings where he was charged with doing so in Louisiana   edit  Haitian migration and influence Pierre Laussat  French Minister in Louisiana 1718    Saint Domingue was  of all our colonies in the Antilles  the one whose mentality and customs influenced Louisiana the most   Louisiana and her Caribbean parent colony developed intimate links during the 18th century  centered on maritime trade  the exchange of capital and information  and the migration of colonists  From such beginnings  Haitians exerted a profound influence on Louisiana s politics  people  religion  and culture  The colony s officials  responding to anti slavery plots and uprisings on the island  banned the entry of enslaved Saint Dominguans in 1763  Their rebellious actions would continue to impact upon Louisiana s slave trade and immigration policies throughout the age of the American and French revolutions  These two democratic struggles struck fear in the hearts of the Spaniards  who governed Louisiana from 1763 to 1800  They suppressed what they saw as seditious activities and banned subversive materials in a futile attempt to isolate their colony from the spread of democratic revolution  In May 1790 a royal decree prohibited the entry of blacks   enslaved and free   from the French West Indies  A year later  the first successful slave revolt in history started  which would lead eventually to the founding of Haiti  33  The revolution in Saint Domingue unleashed a massive multiracial exodus  the French fled with the slaves they managed to keep  so did numerous free people of color  some of whom were slaveholders themselves  In addition in 1793  a catastrophic fire destroyed two thirds of the principal city  Cap Fran ais  present day Cap Ha tien   and nearly ten thousand people left the island for good  In the ensuing decades of revolution  foreign invasion  and civil war  thousands more fled the turmoil  Many moved eastward to Santo Domingo  present day Dominican Republic  or to nearby Caribbean islands  Large numbers of immigrants  black and white  found shelter in North America  notably in New York  Baltimore  fifty three ships landed there in July 1793   Philadelphia  Norfolk  Charleston and Savannah as well as in Spanish Florida  Nowhere on the continent  however  did the refugee movement exert as profound an influence as in southern Louisiana  French pirate Jean Lafitte  who operated in New Orleans  was born in Port au Prince around 1782  34  Between 1791 and 1803  thirteen hundred refugees arrived in New Orleans  The authorities were concerned that some had come with  seditious  ideas  In the spring of 1795  Pointe Coup e was the scene of an attempted insurrection during which planters  homes were burned down  Following the incident  a free  migr  from Saint Domingue  Louis Benoit  accused of being  very imbued with the revolutionary maxims which have devastated the said colony  was banished  The failed uprising caused planter Joseph Pontalba to take  heed of the dreadful calamities of Saint Domingue  and of the germ of revolt only too widespread among our slaves   Continued unrest in Pointe Coup e and on the German Coast contributed to a decision to shut down the entire slave trade in the spring of 1796  In 1800 Louisiana officials debated reopening it  but they agreed that Saint Domingue blacks would be barred from entry  They also noted the presence of black and white insurgents from the French West Indies who were  propagating dangerous doctrines among our Negroes   Their slaves seemed more  insolent    ungovernable   and  insubordinate  than they had been just five years before  That same year  Spain ceded Louisiana back to France  and planters continued to live in fear of revolts  After future emperor Napoleon Bonaparte sold the colony to the United States in 1803 because his disastrous expedition against Saint Domingue had stretched his finances and military too thin  events in the island loomed even larger in Louisiana  35   edit  Purchase by the United States Main article  Louisiana Purchase When the United States won its independence from Great Britain in 1783  one of its major concerns was having a European power on its western boundary  and the need for unrestricted access to the Mississippi River  As American settlers pushed west  they found that the Appalachian Mountains provided a barrier to shipping goods eastward  The easiest way to ship produce was to use a flatboat to float it down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to the port of New Orleans  from whence goods could be put on ocean going vessels  The problem with this route was that the Spanish owned both sides of the Mississippi below Natchez  Napoleon s ambitions in Louisiana involved the creation of a new empire centered on the Caribbean sugar trade  By the terms of the Treaty of Amiens of 1800  Great Britain returned ownership of the islands of Martinique and Guadaloupe to the French  Napoleon looked upon Louisiana as a depot for these sugar islands  and as a buffer to U S  settlement  In October 1801 he sent a large military force to conquer the important island of Santo Domingo and re introduced slavery  which had been abolished in St  Domingue following a slave revolt there in 1792 3  and the legal and constitutional abolition of slavery in French colonies in 1794  When the army led by Napoleon s brother in law Leclerc was defeated by the forces opposed to the re enslavement of most of the population of St  Domingue  Napoleon decided to sell Louisiana  Thomas Jefferson  third President of the United States  was disturbed by Napoleon s plans to re establish French colonies in America  With the possession of New Orleans  Napoleon could close the Mississippi to U S  commerce at any time  Jefferson authorized Robert R  Livingston  U S  Minister to France  to negotiate for the purchase of the City of New Orleans  portions of the east bank of the Mississippi  and free navigation of the river for U S  commerce  Livingston was authorized to pay up to  2 million  An official transfer of Louisiana to French ownership had not yet taken place  and Napoleon s deal with the Spanish was a poorly kept secret on the frontier  On October 18  1802  however  Juan Ventura Morales  Acting Intendant of Louisiana  made public the intention of Spain to revoke the right of deposit at New Orleans for all cargo from the United States  The closure of this vital port to the United States caused anger and consternation  Commerce in the west was virtually blockaded  Historians believe that the revocation of the right of deposit was prompted by abuses of the Americans  particularly smuggling  and not by French intrigues as was believed at the time  President Jefferson ignored public pressure for war with France  and appointed James Monroe a special envoy to Napoleon  to assist in obtaining New Orleans for the United States  Jefferson also raised the authorized expenditure to  10 million  However  on April 11  1803  French Foreign Minister Talleyrand surprised Livingston by asking how much the United States was prepared to pay for the entirety of Louisiana  not just New Orleans and the surrounding area  as Livingston s instructions covered   Monroe agreed with Livingston that Napoleon might withdraw this offer at any time  leaving them with no ability to obtain the desired New Orleans area   and that approval from President Jefferson might take months  so Livingston and Monroe decided to open negotiations immediately  By April 30  they closed a deal for the purchase of the entire Louisiana territory of 828 000 square miles  2 100 000 km2  for 60 million Francs  approximately  15 million   Part of this sum was used to forgive debts owed by France to the United States  The payment was made in United States bonds  which Napoleon sold at face value to the Dutch firm of Hope and Company  and the British banking house of Baring  at a discount of 87  per each  100 unit  As a result  France received only  8 831 250 in cash for Louisiana  Attack of the Union fleet  April 24  1862  Fort St  Philip is shown at right and Fort Jackson at left  Dutiful English banker Alexander Baring conferred with Marbois in Paris  shuttled to the United States to pick up the bonds  took them to Britain  and returned to France with the money   which Napoleon used to wage war against Baring s own country  When news of the purchase reached the United States  Jefferson was surprised  He had authorized the expenditure of  10 million for a port city  and instead received treaties committing the government to spend  15 million on a land package which would double the size of the country  Jefferson s political opponents in the Federalist Party argued that the Louisiana purchase was a worthless desert  and that the Constitution did not provide for the acquisition of new land or negotiating treaties without the consent of the Senate  What really worried the opposition was the new states which would inevitably be carved from the Louisiana territory  strengthening Western and Southern interests in Congress  and further reducing the influence of New England Federalists in national affairs  President Jefferson was an enthusiastic supporter of westward expansion  and held firm in his support for the treaty  Despite Federalist objections  the U S  Senate ratified the Louisiana treaty on October 20  1803  A transfer ceremony was held in New Orleans on November 29  1803  Since the Louisiana territory had never officially been turned over to the French  the Spanish took down their flag  and the French raised theirs  The following day  General James Wilkinson accepted possession of New Orleans for the United States  A similar ceremony was held in St  Louis on March 9  1804  when a French tricolor was raised near the river  replacing the Spanish national flag  The following day  Captain Amos Stoddard of the First U S  Artillery marched his troops into town and had the American flag run up the fort s flagpole  The Louisiana territory was officially transferred to the United States government  represented by Meriwether Lewis  The Louisiana Territory  purchased for less than 3 cents an acre  doubled the size of the United States overnight  without a war or the loss of a single American life  and set a precedent for the purchase of territory  It opened the way for the eventual expansion of the United States across the continent to the Pacific  edit  Demographics Main article  Demographics of

disaster in U S  history  Louisiana is rich in petroleum and natural gas  Petroleum and gas deposits are found in abundance both onshore and offshore in State owned waters  In addition  vast petroleum and natural gas reserves are found offshore from Louisiana in the federally administered Outer Continental Shelf  OCS  in the Gulf of Mexico  According to the Energy Information Administration  the Gulf of Mexico OCS is the largest U S  petroleum producing region  Excluding the Gulf of Mexico OCS  Louisiana ranks fourth in petroleum production and is home to about 2 percent of total U S  petroleum reserves  One third of the oil produced in the United States comes from offshore  and 80  of offshore production comes from deep water off Louisiana  The oil industry employs about 58 000 Louisiana residents and has created another 260 000 oil related jobs  accounting for about 17  of all Louisiana jobs  52  Louisiana s natural gas reserves account for about 5 percent of the U S  total  The recent discovery of the Haynesville Shale formation in parts of or all of Caddo  Bossier  Bienville  Sabine  De Soto  Red River  Sabine  and Natchitoches parishes have made it the world s fourth largest gas field with some wells initially producing over 25 million cubic feet of gas daily  53  Louisiana was the first site of petroleum drilling over water in the world  on Caddo Lake in the northwest corner of the state  The petroleum and gas industry  as well as its subsidiary industries such as transport and refining  have dominated Louisiana s economy since the 1940s  Beginning in 1950  Louisiana was sued several times by the U S  Interior Department  in efforts by the federal government to strip Louisiana of its submerged land property rights  These control vast stores of reservoirs of petroleum and natural gas  When petroleum and gas boomed in the 1970s  so did Louisiana s economy  The Louisiana economy as well as its politics of the last half century cannot be understood without thoroughly accounting for the influence of the petroleum and gas industries  Since the 1980s  these industries  headquarters have consolidated in Houston  but many of the jobs that operate or provide logistical support to the U S  Gulf of Mexico crude oil and gas industry remained in Louisiana as of 2010 update    edit  Law and government Further information  List of Louisiana

congressional districts and is represented in the U S  House of Representatives by six Republicans and one Democrat  Louisiana has nine votes in the Electoral College   edit  Civil law The Louisiana political and legal structure has maintained several elements from the times of French and Spanish governance  One is the use of the term  parish   from the French  paroisse  in place of  county  for administrative subdivision  Another is the legal system of civil law based on French  German and Spanish legal codes and ultimately Roman law as opposed to English common law  Common law is  judge made  law based on precedent  and is the basis of statutes in all other U S  states  Louisiana s type of civil law system is what the majority of nations in the world use  especially in Europe and its former colonies  excluding those that derive from the British Empire  However  it is incorrect to equate the Louisiana Civil Code with the Napoleonic Code  Although the Napoleonic Code strongly influenced Louisiana law  it was never in force in Louisiana  as it was enacted in 1804  after the Louisiana Purchase of 1803  While the Louisiana Civil Code of 1808 has been continuously revised and updated since its enactment  it is still considered the controlling authority in the state  Differences still exist between Louisianan civil law and the common law found in the other U S  states  While some of these differences have been bridged due to the strong influence of common law tradition  54  it is important to note that the  civilian  tradition is still deeply rooted in most aspects of Louisiana private law  Thus property  contractual  business entities structure  much of civil procedure  and family law  as well as some aspects of criminal law  are still mostly based on traditional Roman legal thinking  Model Codes  such as the Uniform Commercial Code  which are adopted by most states within the union including Louisiana  are based on civilian thought  the essence being that it is deductive  as opposed to the common law which is inductive  In the civilian tradition the legislative body agrees a priori on the general principles to be followed  When a set of facts are brought before a judge  he deduces the court s ruling by comparing the facts of the individual case to the law  In contrast  common law  which really does not exist in its pure historical form due to the advent of statutory law  was created by a judge applying other judges  decisions to a new fact pattern brought before him in a case  The result is that historically English judges were not constrained by legislative authority   edit  Marriage In 1997  Louisiana became the first state to offer the option of a traditional marriage or a covenant marriage  55  In a covenant marriage  the couple waives their right to a  no fault  divorce after six months of separation  which is available in a traditional marriage  To divorce under a covenant marriage  a couple must demonstrate cause  Marriages between ascendants and descendants and marriages between collaterals within the fourth degree  i e   siblings  aunt and nephew  uncle and niece  first cousins  are prohibited  56  Same sex marriages are prohibited  57  Louisiana is a community property state  58   edit  Elections Main articles  Elections in Louisiana and Political party strength in Louisiana This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  From 1898 1965  after Louisiana had effectively disfranchised African Americans and poor whites by provisions of a new constitution  it essentially was a one party state dominated by elite white Democrats  The franchise for whites was expanded somewhat during the decades  but blacks remained essentially disfranchised until the Civil Rights Movement  culminating in passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965  In multiple acts of resistance  blacks left the segregation  violence and oppression of the state to seek better opportunities in northern and western industrial cities during the Great Migrations of 1910 1970  markedly reducing their proportion of population in Louisiana  Since the 1960s  when civil rights legislation was passed under President Lyndon Johnson to protect voting and civil rights  most African Americans in the state have affiliated with the Democratic Party  In the same years  many white conservatives have moved to support Republican Party candidates in national and gubernatorial elections  David Vitter is the first Republican in Louisiana to be popularly elected as a U S  Senator  The previous Republican Senator  John S  Harris  who took office in 1868  was chosen by the state legislature  Louisiana is unique among U S  states in using a system for its state and local elections similar to that of modern France  All candidates  regardless of party affiliation  ran in a nonpartisan blanket primary  or  jungle primary   on Election Day  If no candidate had more than 50  of the vote  the two candidates with the highest vote total competed in a runoff election approximately one month later  This run off did not take into account party identification  therefore  it was not uncommon for a Democrat to be in a runoff with a fellow Democrat or a Republican to be in a runoff with a fellow Republican  Congressional races have also been held under the jungle primary system  All other states  except Washington  use single party primaries followed by a general election between party candidates  each conducted by either a plurality voting system or runoff voting  to elect Senators  Representatives  and statewide officials  Between 2008 and 2010  federal congressional elections were run under a closed primary system   limited to registered party members  However  upon the passage of House Bill 292  Louisiana once again adopted a nonpartisan blanket primary for its federal congressional elections  Louisiana has seven seats in the U S  House of Representatives  six of which are currently held by Republicans and one by a Democrat  The state will lose a House seat at the end of the 112th Congress due to stagnant population growth enumerated by the 2010 United States Census

Spanish  African  and Native American cultures  62  The Creole culture is part of White Creoles  and Black Creoles  culture  Originally Cr oles referred to native born whites of French Spanish descent  Later the term also referred to descendants of the white men s relationships with black women  many of whom were educated free people of color  Many of the wealthy white men had quasi permanent relationships with women of color outside their marriages  and supported them as  plac es   If a woman was enslaved at the beginning of the relationship  the man usually arranged for her manumission  as well as that of any of her children  Creoles became associated with the New Orleans area  where the elaborated arrangements flourished  Most wealthy planters had houses in town as well as at their plantations  Popular belief that a Creole is a mixed Black   French person came from the  Haitian  connotation of an African French person  There were many immigrants from Haiti to New Orleans after the Revolution  Although a Black Creole is one type of Creole  it is not the only type  nor the original meaning of Creole  All of the respective cultures of the groups that settled in southern Louisiana have been combined to make one  New Orleans  culture  The creative combination of cultures from these groups  along with Native American culture  was called  Creole  Culture  It has continued as one of the dominant social  economic and political cultures of Louisiana  along with Cajun culture  well into the 20th century  Cajun Culture  The ancestors of Cajuns came from west central France to the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia  Canada  known as Acadia  When the British won the French and Indian War  the British forcibly separated families and evicted them because of their long stated political neutrality  Most captured Acadians were placed in internment camps in England and the New England colonies for 10 to 30 years  Many of those who escaped the British remained in French Canada  Once freed by England  many scattered  some to France  Canada  Mexico  or the Falkland Islands  The majority found refuge in south Louisiana centered in the region around Lafayette and the LaFourche Bayou country  Until the 1970s  Cajuns were often considered lower class citizens  with the term  Cajun  being somewhat derogatory  Once flush with oil and gas riches  Cajun culture  food  music  and their infectious  joie de vivre  lifestyle quickly gained international acclaim  A third distinct culture in Louisiana is that of the Isle os  who are descendants of Spanish Canary Islanders who migrated from the Canary Islands of Spain to Louisiana under the Spanish crown beginning in the mid 1770s  They settled in four main settlements  but many relocated to what is modern day St  Bernard Parish  where the majority of the Isle o population is still concentrated  An annual festival called Fiesta celebrates the heritage of the Isle os  St Bernard Parish has an Isle os museum  cemetery and church  as well as many street names with Spanish words and Spanish surnames from this heritage  Isle o identity is an active concern in the New Orleans suburbs of St  Bernard Parish  LA  Some members of the Isle o community still speak Spanish   with their own Canary Islander accent  Numerous Isle o identity clubs and organizations  and many members of Isle os society keep contact with the Canary Islands of Spain   edit  Languages Louisiana s bilingual state welcome sign  recognizing its French heritage Louisiana has a unique linguistic culture  owing to its French and Spanish heritage  According to the 2000 census  among persons five years old and older  63  90 8  of Louisiana residents speak only English  99  total speak English  and 4 7  speak French at home  7  total speak French   Other minority languages are Spanish  which is spoken by 2 5  of the population  Vietnamese  by 0 6   and German  by 0 2   Although state law recognizes the usage of English and French in certain circumstances  the Louisiana State Constitution does not declare any  de jure official language or languages   64  Currently the  de facto administrative languages  of the Louisiana State Government are English and French  There are several unique dialects of French  Creole  and English spoken in Louisiana  There are two unique dialects of the French language  Cajun French  predominant after the Great Upheaval of Acadians from Canada  and Colonial French  For the Creole language  there is Louisiana Creole French  There are also two unique dialects of the English language  Cajun English  a French influenced variety of English  and what is informally known as Yat  which resembles the New York City dialect  particularly that of historical Brooklyn  as both accents were influenced by large communities of immigrant Irish and Italian  but the Yat dialect was also influenced by French and Spanish  Colonial French was the predominant language of Louisiana during the French colonial period and was spoken primarily by the white settlers  the black creole population spoke mostly creole  Cajun French was only introduced in Louisiana after the Great Upheaval of Acadians from Canada during 1710 1763  The Cajun people and culture  hence the Cajun language as well  did not appear immediately but was rather a slow evolution from the original Acadian culture with influences from local cultures  English and its associated dialects became predominant only after the Louisiana Purchase and even then it still retained some French influences as seen with Cajun English  Cajun French and Colonial French have somewhat merged since English took over   edit  Religion The largest denominations by number of adherents in 2000 were the Roman Catholic Church with 1 382 603  Southern Baptist Convention with 868 587  and the United Methodist Church with 160 153  65  Like other Southern states  the population of Louisiana is made up of numerous Protestant denominations  comprising 60  of the state s adult population  Protestants are concentrated in the northern and central parts of the state and in the northern tier of the Florida Parishes  Because of French and Spanish heritage  whose descendants are Cajun and French Creole  and later Irish  Italian  Portuguese and German immigrants  there is also a large Roman Catholic population  particularly in the southern part of the state  66  Since French Creoles were the first settlers  planters and leaders of the territory  they have traditionally been well represented in politics  For instance  most of the early governors were French Creole Catholics  67  Although nowadays constituting only a plurality but not a majority of Louisiana s population  Catholics have continued to be influential in state politics  As of 2008 update  both Senators and the Governor were Catholic  The high proportion and influence of the Catholic population makes Louisiana distinct among Southern states  68  Current religious affiliations of the people of Louisiana  Christian  90  Protestant  60  Evangelical Protestant 31  69  Historically black Protestant  20  69  Mainline Protestant 9  69  Roman Catholic  28  69  Other Christian  2  Jehovah s Witnesses  1  69  Other Religions  2  Islam  1  69  Buddhism  1  69  Judaism  less than 0 5  69  Non religious  unaffiliated   8  Jewish communities exist in the state s larger cities  notably Baton Rouge and New Orleans  70  The most significant of these is the Jewish community of the New Orleans area  with a pre Katrina population of about 12 000  The presence of a significant Jewish community well established by the early 20th century also made Louisiana unusual among Southern states  although South Carolina and Virginia also had influential populations in some of their major cities from the 18th and 19th centuries  Prominent Jews in Louisiana s political leadership have included Whig  later Democrat  Judah P  Benjamin  1811 1884   who represented Louisiana in the U S  Senate prior to the American Civil War and then became the Confederate Secretary of State  Democrat Adolph Meyer  1842 1908   Confederate Army officer who represented the state in the U S  House from 1891 until his death in 1908  and Republican Secretary of State Jay Dardenne  1954     edit  Music Main article  Music
