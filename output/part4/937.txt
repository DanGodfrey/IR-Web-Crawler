Category v t e Bisexuality is sexual behavior or an orientation involving physical or romantic attraction to males and females  especially with regard to men and women  1  It is one of the three main classifications of sexual orientation  along with a heterosexual and a homosexual orientation  all a part of the heterosexual homosexual continuum  Pansexuality may or may not be subsumed under bisexuality  with some sources stating that bisexuality encompasses sexual or romantic attraction to all gender identities  2  3  People who have a distinct but not exclusive preference for one sex over the other may also identify themselves as bisexual  4  and people who lack sexual attraction to either sex or genders are known as asexual  Bisexuality has been observed in various human societies 5  and elsewhere in the animal kingdom 6  7  8  throughout recorded history  The term bisexuality  however  like the terms hetero  and homosexuality  was coined in the 19th century  9

and Human sexual activity See also  Situational sexual behavior Bisexuality is the romantic or sexual attraction to males and females or to the genders  men  and  women   The American Psychological Association states that  sexual orientation falls along a continuum  In other words  someone does not have to be exclusively homosexual or heterosexual  but can feel varying degrees of both  Sexual orientation develops across a person s lifetime different people realize at different points in their lives that they are heterosexual  bisexual or homosexual   4  10  11  Sexual attraction  behavior and identity may also be incongruent  as sexual attraction or behavior may not necessarily be consistent with identity  Some individuals identify themselves as heterosexual  homosexual or bisexual without having had any sexual experience  Others have had homosexual experiences but do not consider themselves to be gay  lesbian  or bisexual  11  Likewise  self identified gay or lesbian individuals may occasionally sexually interact with members of the opposite sex but do not identify as bisexual  4  11  The terms  heteroflexible  and  homoflexible   as well as the titles  men who have sex with men  and  women who have sex with women   may also be used  According to Rosario  Schrimshaw  Hunter  Braun  2006      the development of a lesbian  gay  or bisexual  LGB  sexual identity is a complex and often difficult process  Unlike members of other minority groups  e g   ethnic and racial minorities   most LGB individuals are not raised in a community of similar others from whom they learn about their identity and who reinforce and support that identity  Rather  LGB individuals are often raised in communities that are either ignorant of or openly hostile toward homosexuality  4  In a longitudinal study about sexual identity development among lesbian  gay  and bisexual  LGB  youths  its authors  found evidence of both considerable consistency and change in LGB sexual identity over time   Youths who had identified as both gay lesbian and bisexual prior to baseline were approximately three times more likely to identify as gay lesbian than as bisexual at subsequent assessments  Of youths who had identified only as bisexual at earlier assessments  60 70  continued to thus identify  while approximately 30 40  assumed a gay lesbian identity over time  Authors suggested that  although there were youths who consistently self identified as bisexual throughout the study  for other youths  a bisexual identity served as a transitional identity to a subsequent gay lesbian identity   4   edit  Label accuracy Like other queer sexualities  bisexuality has been discriminated against  Most of the discrimination has surrounded the application of the word  bisexual  and scrutiny of the bisexual identity as a whole  The belief that bisexuality does not exist is common  and stems from two views  In the heterosexist view  people are presumed to be attracted to the opposite sex and it is sometimes reasoned that only heterosexuality truly exists  In the monosexist view  people are either exclusively homosexual  gay lesbian   exclusively heterosexual  straight   closeted homosexual people who wish to appear heterosexual  12  heterosexuals who are experimenting with their sexuality  13  14  15  or cannot be bisexual unless they are equally attracted to both sexes  16  The belief that one cannot be bisexual unless equally attracted to both sexes is disputed by various researchers  who have reported bisexuality to fall on a continuum  like sexuality in general  4  17  In 2005  the belief that bisexuality must involve equal sexual romantic attraction was further perpetuated by researchers Gerulf Rieger  Meredith L  Chivers  and J  Michael Bailey  18  who concluded that bisexuality is extremely rare in men  This was based on results of controversial penile plethysmograph testing when viewing pornographic material involving only men and pornography involving only women  Critics state that this study works from the assumption that a person is only truly bisexual if he or she exhibits virtually equal arousal responses to both opposite sex and same sex stimuli  and have consequently dismissed the self identification of people whose arousal patterns showed even a mild preference for one sex  Some researchers say that the technique used in the study to measure genital arousal is too crude to capture the richness  erotic sensations  affection  admiration  that constitutes sexual attraction  17  The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force called the study and The New York Times coverage of it flawed and biphobic  19 FAIR also criticized the study  20  In 2008  Bailey stated he regretted repeating the notion that people are gay  straight or lying  especially with regard to men  In a new study with the same technology but different recruiting criteria and stimuli  he said he found bisexual genital arousal patterns in men  21  22  In 1995  Harvard Shakespeare professor Marjorie Garber made the academic case for bisexuality with her Vice Versa  Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life  in which she argued that most people would be bisexual if not for  repression  religion  repugnance  denial  laziness  shyness  lack of opportunity  premature specialization  a failure of imagination  or a life already full to the brim with erotic experiences  albeit with only one person  or only one gender   23   edit  Kinsey scale Main article  Kinsey scale The Kinsey scale attempts to describe a person s sexual history or episodes of their sexual activity at a given time  It uses a scale from 0  meaning exclusively heterosexual  to 6  meaning exclusively homosexual  24   edit  Prevalence Main articles  Demographics of sexual orientation and Kinsey Reports A 2002 survey in the United States by National Center for Health Statistics found that 1 8 percent of men ages 18 44 considered themselves bisexual  2 3 percent homosexual  and 3 9 percent as  something else   The same study found that 2 8 percent of women ages 18 44 considered themselves bisexual  1 3 percent homosexual  and 3 8 percent as  something else   25 The Janus Report on Sexual Behavior  published in 1993  showed that 5 percent of men and 3 percent of women consider themselves bisexual and 4 percent of men and 2 percent of women considered themselves homosexual  25  The  Health  section of The New York Times stated that  1 5 percent of American women and 1 7 percent of American men identify themselves  as  bisexual   17  A 2007 report said that 14 4  of young US women identified themselves as bisexual lesbian  with 5 6  of the men identifying as gay or bisexual  26  A study in the journal Biological Psychology in 2011 reported that there were men who identify themselves as bisexuals and who were aroused by both men and women  27  Dr  Alfred Kinsey s 1948 work Sexual Behavior in the Human Male found that  46  of the male population had engaged in both heterosexual and homosexual activities  or  reacted to  persons of both sexes  in the course of their adult lives   28  Kinsey himself disliked the use of the term bisexual to describe individuals who engage in sexual activity with both males and females  preferring to use  bisexual  in its original  biological sense as hermaphroditic   Until it is demonstrated  that  taste in a sexual relation is dependent upon the individual containing within his anatomy both male and female structures  or male and female physiological capacities  it is unfortunate to call such individuals bisexual   Kinsey et al   1948  p  657   29  Dr  Fritz Klein believed that social and emotional attraction are very important elements in bisexual attraction  One third of the men in each group showed no significant arousal  The study did not claim them to be asexual  and Rieger stated that their lack of response did not change the overall findings   edit  Studies  theories and social responses Main articles  Biology and sexual orientation and Environment and sexual orientation Further information  Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation  Fraternal birth order and sexual orientation  and Innate bisexuality There is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual  bisexual or homosexual orientation  30  Proposed reasons include a combination of genetic factors 31  32  and environmental factors  including fraternal birth order  where the number of older brothers a boy has increases the chances of homosexuality  specific prenatal hormone exposure  where hormones play a role in determining sexual orientation as they do with sex differentiation  33  34  and prenatal stress on the mother 35  36  37    The American Academy of Pediatrics has stated that  sexual orientation probably is not determined by any one factor but by a combination of genetic  hormonal  and environmental influences   38  The American Psychological Association has stated that  there are probably many reasons for a person s sexual orientation and the reasons may be different for different people   It further stated that  for most people  sexual orientation is determined at an early age  39  The American Psychiatric Association stated   To date there are no replicated scientific studies supporting any specific biological etiology for homosexuality  Similarly  no specific psychosocial or family dynamic cause for homosexuality has been identified  including histories of childhood sexual abuse   40  Research into how sexual orientation may be determined by genetic or other prenatal factors plays a role in political and social debates about homosexuality  and also raises fears about genetic profiling and prenatal testing  41  Sigmund Freud theorized that every person has the ability to become bisexual at some time in his or her life  17  42  He based this on the idea that enjoyable experiences of sexuality with the same sex  whether sought or unsought  acting on it or being fantasized  become an attachment to his or her needs and desires in social upbringing  Psychoanalyst Dr  Joseph Merlino  editor of Freud at 150  21st Century Essays on a Man of Genius  stated in an interview    Freud maintained that bisexuality was a normal part of development     Freud felt there were a number of homosexuals he encountered who did not have a variety of complex problems that homosexuality was a part of  He found people who were totally normal in every other regard except in terms of their sexual preference  In fact  he saw many of them as having higher intellects  higher aesthetic sensibilities  higher morals  those kinds of things  He did not see it as something to criminalize or penalize  or to keep from psychoanalytic training  A lot of the psychoanalytic institutes felt if you were homosexual you should not be accepted  that was not Freud s position  43    Human bisexuality has mainly been studied alongside homosexuality  Van Wyk  amp  Geist argue that this is a problem for sexuality research because the few studies that have observed bisexuals separately have found that bisexuals are often different from both heterosexuals and homosexuals  Furthermore  bisexuality does not always represent a halfway point between the dichotomy  Research indicates that bisexuality is influenced by biological  cognitive and cultural variables in interaction  and this leads to different types of bisexuality  44  In the current debate around influences on sexual orientation  biological explanations have been questioned by social scientists  particularly by feminists who encourage women to make conscious decisions about their life and sexuality  A difference in attitude between homosexual men and women has also been reported  with men more likely to regard their sexuality as biological   reflecting the universal male experience in this culture  not the complexities of the lesbian world   There is also evidence that women s sexuality may be more strongly affected by cultural and contextual factors  45  Most of the few available scientific studies on bisexuality date from before the 1990s  Interest in bisexuality has generally grown  but research focus has lately been on sociology and gender studies as well as on bisexuals with HIV and AIDS  citation needed   edit  Social factors Krafft Ebing was the first to suggest that bisexuality is the original state of human sexuality verification needed   Freud has famously summarized on the basis of clinical observations    W e have come to know that all human beings are bisexual     and that their libido is distributed between objects of both sexes  either in a manifest or a latent form   According to Freud  people remain bisexual all their lives in a repression to monosexuality of fantasy and behavior  This idea was taken up in the 1940s by the zoologist Alfred Kinsey who was the first to create a scale to measure the continuum of sexual orientation from hetero to homosexuality  Kinsey studied human sexuality and argued that people have the capability of being hetero or homosexual even if this trait does not present itself in the current circumstances  46  From an anthropological perspective  there is large variation in the prevalence of bisexuality between different cultures  Among some tribes it appears to be non existent while in others a universal  including the Sambia of New Guinea and other similar Melanesian cultures  44   edit  Sex drive Several studies comparing bisexuals with hetero  or homosexuals have indicated that bisexuals have higher rates of sexual activity  fantasy or erotic interest  Van Wyk and Geist  1984  found that male and female bisexuals had more sexual fantasy than heterosexuals  Dixon  1985  found that bisexual men had more sexual activities with women than did heterosexual men  Bisexual men masturbated more but had fewer happy marriages than heterosexuals  Bressler and Lavender  1986  found that bisexual women had more orgasms per week and they described them as stronger than those of hetero  or homosexual women  They also found that marriages with a bisexual female were more happy than heterosexual unions  observed less instance of hidden infidelity  and ended in divorce less frequently  Goode and Haber  1977  found bisexual women to be sexually mature earlier  masturbate and enjoy masturbation more and to be more experienced in different types of heterosexual contact  44  Recent research suggests that  for most women  high sex drive is associated with increased sexual attraction to both women and men  For men  however  high sex drive is associated with increased attraction to one sex or the other  but not to both  depending on sexual orientation  47  Bisexual men s pattern has been more similar to heterosexuals with a stronger correlation with high sex drive for one sex  but with other sex attraction as well  clarification needed  48   edit  Masculinization Masculinization of women and hypermasculinization of men has been a central theme in sexual orientation research  There are several studies suggesting that bisexuals have a high degree of masculinization  LaTorre and Wendenberg  1983  found differing personality characteristics for bisexual  heterosexual and homosexual women  Bisexuals were found to have fewer personal insecurities than heterosexuals and homosexuals  This finding defined bisexuals as self assured and less likely to suffer from mental instabilities  The confidence of a secure identity consistently translated to more masculinity than other subjects  This study did not explore societal norms  prejudices  or the feminization of homosexual males  44  In a research comparison  published in the Journal of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology  women usually have a better hearing sensitivity than males  assumed by researchers as a genetic disposition connected to child bearing  Homosexual and bisexual women have been found to have a hypersensitivity to sound in comparison to heterosexual women  suggesting a genetic disposition to not tolerate high pitched tones  While heterosexual  homosexual and bisexual men have been found to exhibit similar patterns of hearing  there was a notable differential within a sub group of males identified as hyperfeminized homosexual males who exhibited test results similar to heterosexual women  49   edit  Prenatal hormones The prenatal hormonal theory of sexual orientation suggests that people who are exposed to excess levels of sex hormones have masculinized brains and show increased homosexuality or bisexuality  Studies provide evidence for the masculinization of the brain have however not been conducted to date  Research on special conditions such as CAH and exposure to DES indicate that prenatal exposure to  respectively  excess testosterone and estrogens are associated with female female sex fantasies in adults  Both effects are associated with bisexuality rather than homosexuality  45  There is research evidence that the digit ratio of the length of the 2nd and 4th digits  index finger and ring finger  is somewhat negatively related to prenatal testosterone and positively to estrogen  Studies measuring the fingers found a statistically significant skew in the 2D 4D ratio  long ring finger  towards homosexuality with an even lower ratio in bisexuals  It is suggested that exposure to high prenatal testosterone and low prenatal estrogen concentrations is one cause of homosexuality whereas exposure to very high testosterone levels may be associated with bisexuality  Because testosterone in general is important for sexual differentiation  this view offers an alternative to the suggestion that male homosexuality is genetic  50  The prenatal hormonal theory suggests that a homosexual orientation results from exposure to excessive testosterone causing an over masculinized brain  This is contradictory to another hypothesis that homosexual preferences may be due to a feminized brain in males  However  it has also been suggested that homosexuality may be due to high prenatal levels of unbound testosterone that results from a lack of receptors at particular brain sites  Therefore the brain could be feminized while other features  such as the 2D 4D ratio could be over masculinized  48   edit  Brain structure LaVey s  1991  examination at autopsy of 18 homosexual men  1 bisexual man  16 presumably heterosexual men and 6 presumably heterosexual women found that the INAH 3 nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus of homosexual men was smaller than that of heterosexual men and closer in size of heterosexual women  Although grouped with homosexuals  the INAH 3 size of the one bisexual subject was similar to that of the heterosexual men  44  The results of such studies have been proven unreliable  51   edit  Chromosomes Some evidence supports the concept of biological precursors of bisexual orientation in genetic males  According to Money  1988   men with an extra Y chromosome are more likely to be bisexual  paraphilic and impulsive  44   edit  Evolutionary theory Some evolutionary psychologists have argued that same sex attraction does not have adaptive value because it has no association with potential reproductive success  Instead  bisexuality can be due to normal variation in brain plasticity  More recently  it has been suggested that same sex alliances may have helped males climb the social hierarchy giving access to females and reproductive opportunities  Same sex allies could have helped females to move to the safer and resource richer center of the group  which increased their chances of raising their offspring successfully  48  Brendan Zietsch of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research proposes the alternative theory that men exhibiting female traits become more attractive to females and are thus more likely to mate  provided the genes involved do not drive them to complete rejection of heterosexuality  52  Also  in a 2008 study  its authors stated that  There is considerable evidence that human sexual orientation is genetically influenced  so it is not known how homosexuality  which tends to lower reproductive success  is maintained in the population at a relatively high frequency   They hypothesized that  while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals  reproductive success  they may confer some advantage in heterosexuals who carry them   and their results suggested that  genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals  which could help explain the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population   53  In Scientific American Mind  scientist Emily V  Driscoll stated that homosexual and bisexual behavior is quite common in several species and that it fosters bonding   The more homosexuality  the more peaceful the species   The article also stated   Unlike most humans  however  individual animals generally cannot be classified as gay or straight  an animal that engages in a same sex flirtation or partnership does not necessarily shun heterosexual encounters  Rather  many species seem to have ingrained homosexual tendencies that are a regular part of their society  That is  there are probably no strictly gay critters  just bisexual ones  Animals don t do sexual identity  They just do sex   54   edit  History Shudo  Japanese pederasty   a young male entertains an older male lover  covering his eyes while surreptitiously kissing a female servant   edit  Ancient Greece Main article  Homosexuality in ancient Greece Ancient Greeks did not associate sexual relations with binary labels  as modern Western society does  Men who had male lovers were not identified as homosexual  and may have had wives or other female lovers  Ancient Greek religious texts  reflecting cultural practices  incorporated bisexual themes  The subtexts varied  from the mystical to the didactic  55  Spartans thought that love and erotic relationships between experienced and novice soldiers would solidify combat loyalty and unit cohesion  and encourage heroic tactics as men vied to impress their lovers  Once the younger soldiers reached maturity  the relationship was supposed to become non sexual  but it is not clear how strictly this was followed  There was some stigma attached to young men who continued their relationships with their mentors into adulthood  55  For example  Aristophanes calls them eurypr ktoi  meaning  wide arses   and depicts them like women  55  Young man and teenager engaging in intercrural sex  fragment of a black

Augustus Caesar that he was  every man s wife and every woman s husband   In 124 AD the bisexual Roman emperor Hadrian met Antinous  a 13  or 14 year old boy from Bithynia  and inducted him into his Imperial Entourage  Antinous eventually became the Emperor s favourite  He was deified by Hadrian when he died six years later after sacrificing himself to the gods of the river Nile in order to cure the sickly Hadrian  other accounts say that he was murdered by the Emperor s detractors  Many statues  busts  coins and reliefs depict Hadrian s deep fixation with him and the Emperor even founded the city of Antinopolis near the site of his favourite s death   edit  Social status This article is about bisexuality in human sexuality  For Bisexual Fluid Pansexual community s  in current culture  see Bisexual community  Because some bisexual people do not feel that they fit into either the homosexual or the heterosexual world  and because they have a tendency to be  invisible  in public  some bisexual persons are committed to forming their own communities  culture  and political movements  Some who identify as bisexual may merge themselves into either homosexual or heterosexual society  Still other bisexual people see this merging as enforced rather than voluntary  bisexual people can face exclusion from both homosexual and heterosexual society on coming out  Psychologist Beth Firestein states that bisexuals tend to internalize social tensions related to their choice of partners 56  and feel pressured to label themselves as homosexuals instead of occupying the difficult middle ground where attraction to people of both sexes would defy society s value on monogamy  56  These social tensions and pressure may affect bisexuals  mental health  and specific therapy methods have been developed for bisexuals to address this concern  56  Bisexual behaviors are also associated in popular culture with men who engage in same sex activity while otherwise presenting as heterosexual  The majority of such men   said to be living on the down low   do not self identify as bisexual  57  However  this may be a cultural misperception closely related to that of other LGBT individuals who hide their actual orientation due to societal pressures  a phenomenon colloquially called  being closeted    edit  Pride symbols Main article  LGBT symbols The bisexual pride flag A common symbol of the Bisexual community is the bisexual pride flag  which has a deep pink stripe at the top for homosexuality  a blue one on the bottom for heterosexuality  and a purple one  blended from the pink and blue  in the middle to represent bisexuality  58  The overlapping triangles Another symbol with the same color scheme is a pair of overlapping pink and blue triangles  the pink triangle being a well known symbol for the homosexual community  forming purple where they intersect  59  Bisexual moon symbol Many homosexual and bisexual individuals have a problem with the use of the pink triangle symbol  as it was the symbol that Hitler s regime used to tag and persecute homosexuals  similar to the yellow Star of David constituted of two opposed  overlapping triangles   Therefore  a double moon symbol was devised specifically to avoid the use of triangles  60  The double moon symbol is common in Germany and surrounding countries  60  Another symbol used for bisexuality is a purple diamond  conceptually derived from the intersection of two triangles  pink and blue  respectively   placed overlapping   edit  Elsewhere in the animal kingdom Main article  Animal sexuality See also  Homosexual behavior in animals Many non human animal species also exhibit bisexual behavior  6  7  8  Examples of mammals include the bonobo  formerly known as the pygmy chimpanzee   orca  and bottlenose dolphin  Examples of avians include some species of gulls and Humboldt Penguins  Other examples occur among fish and flatworms  61  Many species of animals are involved in the act of forming sexual and relationship bonds between the same sex  even when offered the opportunity to breed with members of the opposite sex  they picked the same sex  Some of these species are gazelles  antelope  bison  and sage grouse  62  In some cases animals will choose intercourse with different sexes at different times in their life  and sometimes will perform intercourse with different sexes at random  Homosexual intercourse can also be seasonal in some animals like male walruses  who often engage in homosexual intercourse with each other outside of the breeding season and will revert to heterosexual intercourse during breeding season  62  In some cases bisexuality is actually a form of fitness favored by evolution  For example  female Cnemidophorus  a genus of whiptail lizards  reproduce by pairing up with each other  During the breeding season  females will take turns switching between  male  and  female  roles as their hormones fluctuate  Estrogen levels are high during ovulation   female  role  and much lower after laying eggs   male  role   While in the  male  role  a female lizard will mount another in the  female  role and go through the motions of sex to stimulate egg laying  The hatchlings produced are all female  This all female species has evolved from lizards with two sexes  but their eggs develop without fertilization  parthenogenesis   Female whiptail lizards can lay eggs without sex  but they lay far fewer eggs than if they engage in sexual stimulation by another female  63   edit  In culture Main article  Media portrayals of bisexuality  edit  Film Notable portrayals of bisexuality can be found throughout mainstream media in movies such as  Black Swan  Showgirls  The Pillow Book  Alexander  The Rocky Horror

Beginning with the 2009 season  MTV s The Real World series featured two bisexual characters  66  Emily Schromm  67  and Mike Manning  68  Some bloggers suggested he was in fact gay  69  70  although he himself identified as bisexual  68  In the BBC TV science fiction show  Torchwood  several of the main characters  appear to have fluid sexuality  Most prominent among these is Captain Jack Harkness  John Barrowman   is bisexual who is the lead character and an otherwise conventional science fiction action hero  Described within the logic of the show  where characters can also interact with alien species  producers sometimes use the term  omnisexual  to describe him  71  Jack s ex  Captain John Hart  James Marsters  is also bisexual  72  Of his female exes  significantly at least one ex wife and at least one woman with whom he has had a child have been indicated  Some critics draw the conclusion that the series more often shows Jack with men than women  73  Creator Russell T Davies says one of pitfalls of writing a bisexual character is you  fall into the trap  of  only having them sleep with men   He describes of the show s fourth series   You ll see the full range of his appetites  in a really properly done way   74  The preoccupation with bisexuality has been seen by critics as complimentary to other aspects of the show s themes  For heterosexual character Gwen Cooper  Eve Myles   for whom Jack harbors romantic feelings  the new experiences she confronts at Torchwood  in the form of   affairs and homosexuality and the threat of death   connote not only the Other but a  missing side  to the Self  75  Under the influence of an alien pheromone  Gwen kisses a woman in episode two of the series  In episode one  heterosexual Owen Harper  Burn Gorman  kisses a

musician David Bowie famously declared himself bisexual in an interview with Melody Maker in January 1972  a move coinciding with the first shots in his campaign for stardom as Ziggy Stardust  79  In a September 1976 interview with Playboy  Bowie said   It s true I am a bisexual  But I can t deny that I ve used that fact very well  I suppose it s the best thing that ever happened to me   80  In a 1983 interview he said it was  the biggest mistake I ever made   81  82  elaborating in 2002 he explained  I don t think it was a mistake in Europe  but it was a lot tougher in America  I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual  But I had no inclination to hold any banners or be a representative of any group of people  I knew what I wanted to be  which was a songwriter and a performer       America is a very puritanical place  and I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do  83  In 1995  Jill Sobule sung about bi curiosity in her song  I Kissed a Girl   with a video that alternated images of Sobule and a boyfriend  played by Fabio  along with images of her with a girlfriend  Another song with the same name by Katy Perry also hints at the same theme  Some activists suggest the song merely reinforces the stereotype of bisexuals experimenting and of bisexuality not being a real sexual preference  Lady Gaga has stated that she is bisexual  84  and has stated that her song  Poker Face  is about fantasizing about a woman while being with a man  85  British singer Jessie J is also openly bisexual and stated in an interview on the  In Demand  radio show on March 3  2011  I ve never denied it  Whoopie doo guys  yes  I ve dated girls and I ve dated boys   get over it   86  87   edit  Literature Virginia Woolf s Orlando  A Biography  1928  is an early example of bisexuality in literature  The story  of a man who changes into a woman without a second thought  was based on the life of Woolf s lover Vita Sackville West  Woolf used the gender switch to avoid the book being banned for homosexual content  Her 1925 book Mrs Dalloway focused on a bisexual man and a bisexual woman in sexually unfulfilled heterosexual marriages in later life  Following Sackille West s death  her son Nigel Nicolson published Portrait of a Marriage  one of her diaries recounting her affair with a woman during her marriage to Harold Nicolson  Other early examples include works of D H  Lawrence  such as Women in Love  1920   and Colette s Claudine  1900 1903  series  The main character in Patrick White s novel  The Twyborn Affair  1979   is bisexual  Contemporary novelist Bret Easton Ellis  novels  such as Less Than Zero  1985  and The Rules of Attraction  1987  frequently feature bisexual male characters  this  casual approach  to bisexual characters recurs throughout Ellis  work  88   edit  Webseries In October 2009   A Rose By Any Other Name  89  was released as a  webisode  series on YouTube  Directed by bisexual rights advocate Kyle Schickner  90  the plot centers around a lesbian identified woman who falls in love with a straight man and decides she is actually bisexual  91   edit  Media stereotypes There tend to be negative media portrayals  references are sometimes made to stereotypes or mental disorders  In an article regarding the 2005 film Brokeback Mountain  sex educator Amy Andre argued that in films  bisexuals are often depicted negatively  92  I like movies where bisexuals come out to each other together and fall in love  because these tend to be so few and far between  the most recent example would be 2002 s lovely romantic comedy  Kissing Jessica Stein  Most movies with bi characters paint a stereotypical picture     The bi love interest is usually deceptive  Mulholland Drive   over sexed  Sex Monster   unfaithful  High Art   and fickle  Three of Hearts   and might even be a serial killer  like Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct  In other words  the bisexual is always the cause of the conflict in the film   Amy Andre  American Sexuality Magazine Using a content analysis of more than 170 articles written between 2001 and 2006  sociologist Richard N  Pitt  Jr  concluded that the media pathologized black bisexual men s behavior while either ignoring or sympathizing with white bisexual men s similar actions  He argued that the black bisexual is often described as a duplicitous heterosexual man spreading the HIV AIDS virus  Alternatively  the  Brokeback  white bisexual  when seen as bisexual at all  is often described in pitying language as a victimized homosexual man forced into the closet by the heterosexist society around him  93  On the HBO drama Oz  Christopher Meloni played Chris Keller  a bisexual serial killer who tortured and raped various men and women  Other films in which bisexual characters conceal murderous neuroses include Black Widow  Blue Velvet  Cruising  Single White Female  and Girl  Interrupted   edit  See also Bisexual Community Bicurious Bisexual chic
