also  List of North Dakota counties Map of North Dakota North Dakota is considered to be in the U S  region known as the Great Plains  and is sometimes referred to as being the  High Plains   The state shares the Red River of the North with Minnesota on the east  South Dakota is to the south  Montana is to the west  and the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba are north  North Dakota sits essentially in the middle of North America  and in fact a stone marker in Rugby  North Dakota  identifies itself as being the  Geographic Center of the North American Continent   With 70 762 square miles  183 273 km2   6  North Dakota is the 19th largest state  7  The western half of the state consists of the hilly Great Plains  and the northern part of the Badlands to the west of the Missouri River  The state s high point  White Butte at 3 506 feet  1 069 m   and Theodore Roosevelt National Park 8  are located in the Badlands  The region is abundant in fossil fuels including crude oil and lignite coal  The Missouri River forms Lake Sakakawea  the third largest man made lake in the United States  behind the Garrison Dam  9  The central region of the state is divided into the Drift Prairie and the Missouri Plateau  The eastern part of the state consists of the flat Red River Valley  the bottom of glacial Lake Agassiz  Its fertile soil  drained by the meandering Red River flowing northward into Lake Winnipeg  supports a large agriculture industry  10 Devils Lake  the largest natural lake in the state  is also found in the east  11  Eastern North Dakota is overall flat  however  there are significant hills and buttes in western North Dakota  Most of the state is covered in grassland  crops cover most of eastern North Dakota but are sparse in the center and west  Natural trees in North Dakota are found usually where there is good drainage such as the ravines and valley near the Pembina Gorge and Killdeer Mountains  the Turtle Mountains  the hills around Devil s Lake  in the dunes area of McHenry County in central North Dakota  and along the Sheyenne Valley slopes and the Sheyenne delta   edit  Climate Main article  Climate of North Dakota North Dakota s climate is typical of a northern continental climate with cold winters and hot summers  Meteorological events can include rain  snow  hail  blizzards  polar fronts  tornadoes  thunderstorms  and high velocity straight line winds  Average annual precipitation ranges from 14 in  360 mm  in the northwest to 22 in  560 mm  in the southeast  12  Springtime flooding is a relatively common event in the Red River Valley  because of the river flowing north into Canada  creating ice jams  The spring melt and the eventual runoff typically begins earlier in the southern part of the valley than in the northern part  13  The most destructive flooding in eastern North Dakota occurred in 1997  14  North Dakota is largely semi arid  however  the low temperatures and snowpack prevents the state from having a xeric character  The American Lung Association in its 2009  State of the Air  report ranked Fargo  North Dakota as the cleanest city in the United States  and gave the balance of the state 11  A  ratings on air quality  15  16   edit  History Main article  History of North Dakota Fort Union Trading Post National Historic Site Prior to European contact  Native Americans inhabited North Dakota for thousands of years  The first European to reach the area was the French Canadian trader La V rendrye  who led an exploration party to Mandan villages in 1738  17  The trading arrangement between tribes was such that North Dakota tribes rarely dealt directly with Europeans  However  the native tribes were in sufficient contact that by the time that Lewis and Clark entered North Dakota in 1804  they were aware of the French and then Spanish claims to their territory  18  Settlers in front of their sod house in Milton in 1898 Much of present day North Dakota was included in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803  the remainder was acquired in the Treaty of 1818  Much of the acquired land was organized into Minnesota and Nebraska Territories  Dakota Territory  making up present day North and South Dakota  along with parts of present day Wyoming and Montana  was organized on March 2  1861  19  Dakota Territory was settled sparsely until the late 19th century  when the railroads entered the region and aggressively marketed the land  An omnibus bill for statehood for North Dakota  South Dakota  Montana  and Washington titled the Enabling Act of 1889 was passed on February 22  1889 during the administration of Grover Cleveland  After Cleveland left office  it was left to his successor  Benjamin Harrison  to sign proclamations formally admitting North and South Dakota to the Union on November 2  1889  20  The rivalry between the two new states presented a dilemma of which was to be admitted first  Harrison directed Secretary of State James G  Blaine to shuffle the papers and obscure from him which he was signing first and the actual order went unrecorded  thus no one knows which of the Dakotas was admitted first  21  22  However  since North Dakota alphabetically appears before South Dakota  its proclamation was published first in the Statutes At Large  Since that day  it has become common to list the Dakotas alphabetically and thus North Dakota is usually listed as the 39th state  Unrest among wheat farmers  especially among Norwegians  led to a radical political movement after World War I centered in the left wing Non Partisan League   NPL    The NPL  which eventually merged into the Democratic Party  attempted to insulate North Dakota from the power of out of state banks and corporations  In addition to founding the state owned Bank of North Dakota and North Dakota Mill and Elevator  both still in existence   the NPL established a state owned railroad line  later sold to the Soo Line Railroad   Anti corporate laws were passed that virtually prohibited a corporation or bank from owning title to land zoned as farmland  These laws  still in force today  after having been upheld by both State and Federal courts  make it almost impossible to foreclose on farmland  as even after foreclosure  the property title cannot be held by a bank or mortgage company  A round of federal construction projects began in the 1950s  including the Garrison Dam and the Minot and Grand Forks Air Force bases  23  There was a boom in oil exploration in western North Dakota in the 1980s  as rising petroleum prices made development profitable  24  The original North Dakota State Capitol burned to the ground on December 28  1930  and was replaced by a limestone faced art deco skyscraper that still stands today  25   edit  Demographics  edit  Population North Dakota population density The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of North Dakota was 683 932 on July 1  2011  a 1 69  increase since the 2010 United States

a decrease due to net migration of 17 787 people out of the state  28 Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 3 323 people  and migration within the country produced a

particularly among younger people with university degrees  Subsistence farming proved to be too risky for families  and many people moved to urban areas for jobs  32  One of the major causes of emigration in North Dakota is the lack of skilled jobs for college graduates  Some propose the expansion of economic development programs to create skilled and high tech jobs  but the effectiveness of such programs has been open to debate  33  During the first decade of the 21st century  the population increased  in large part because of jobs in the oil industry  related to development of oil shale fields  citation needed   edit  Languages In addition to English  2 5  of the population speak German  34   edit  Ethnic groups and ancestry Most North Dakotans are of Northern European descent  As of

American Indian presence North Dakota has a great number of Native Americans  Powwows  or pow wows  are an important aspect of Native American culture  Throughout Native American history  powwows were held  usually in the spring  to rejoice on the beginning of new life  These events brought Native American tribes together for singing and dancing and allowed them to meet up with old friendships  as well as to make new ones  Many powwows also held religious significance for some tribes  Today  powwows are still a part of the Native American culture  and are attended by Native and non Natives alike  In North Dakota  the United Tribes International Powwow  held each September in Bismarck  is one of the largest powwows in the United States  A powwow is complete with parades and dancers in
