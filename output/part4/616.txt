individual s or household s state of being in an economically favorable position in contrast to a given reference group  3  While there are no precise guidelines or thresholds for what may be considered affluent  the United States Department of Commerce s Bureau of the Census does provide detailed statistical data on the economic state of America s population  Income  measured either by household or individual  is perhaps the most commonly used measure for whether or not a given entity may be considered affluent  The term s usage varies greatly depending on context and speaker  Both an upper middle class person with a personal income of  77 500 annually and a billionaire may be referred to as affluent  If the average American with a median income of roughly  32 000 4    39 000 for those employed full time between the ages of 25 and 64  5  was used as a reference group  the upper middle class person with a personal income in the tenth percentile of  77 500 may indeed be referred to as affluent  4  If compared to an executive of the Fortune 500  however  the upper middle class person would be poor  6  7  Currently  marketing corporations and investment houses classify those with household incomes exceeding  75 000 as mass affluent  while sociologist Leonard Beeghley identifies all those with a net worth of  1 million or more as  rich   The upper class is most commonly defined as the top 1  with household incomes commonly exceeding  250 000 annually  These two figures should be seen only as guidelines based upon the top 1  of a population because net worth exceeding  1 million may be increasingly inaccurate as an upper class indicator as the value of the dollar falls and inflation along with interest and the turn of the 21st century s real estate boom causes more and more people to self classify as millionaires  citation needed  The U S  Census Bureau offers income data by household and individual  42  of households have two income earners  thus making households  income levels higher than personal income levels  8  The 2005 economic survey revealed the income distribution for households and individuals whereby the top 5  of individuals had six figure incomes  exceeding  100 000  and the top 10  of individuals had incomes exceeding  75 000  4  The top 5  of households  three quarters of whom had two income earners  had incomes of  166 200  about 10 times the 2009 minimum wage in the US  or more  8  with the top 10  having incomes well in excess of  100 000  9  The top 1 5  of households had incomes exceeding  250 000 with 146 000 households  the top 0 12   having incomes exceeding  1 600 000 annually  10  Households may also be differentiated among each other  depending on whether or not they have one or multiple income earners  The high female participation in the economy means that many households have two working members  11  In 2005 for example  the median households income for a two income earner households was  67 000  The median income for an individual employed full time with a graduate degree was in excess of  60 000  concluding that nearly half of those with graduate degree are able to out earn most dual income households with one income  5  The average home in the United States has more than 700 square feet per person  which is 50    100  more than in other high income countries  Even in the lowest income percentiles people enjoy more space than middle classes in Europe  Likewise even in the lowest percentiles ownership rates of gadgets and amenities are exceptionally high compared to other countries  12  13  The labor market in the United States has attracted immigrants from all over the world and its net migration rate is among the highest in the world  Overall the term affluent may be applied to a variety of individuals  households or other entities depending on context  Data from the U S  Census Bureau serves as the main guideline for defining affluence  U S  government data not only reveals the nation s income distribution but also provides data regarding the demographic characteristics of those to whom the term  affluent  may be applied  8  Contents 1 Top percentiles 1 1

course of time  with income gains being substantially larger for the upper  than for the lower  percentiles  16  All areas of the income strata saw their incomes rise since the late 1960s  especially during the late 1990s  14  The overall increase in household income is largely the result of an increased percentage of households with more than one income earner  While households with just one income earner  most commonly the male  were the norm in the middle of the 20th century  42  of all households and the vast majority of married couple households now have two or more income earners  With so many present day households having two income earners  a substantial increase in household income is easy to explain  11     The typical middle class household in the United States is no longer a one earner family  with one parent in the workforce and one at home full time  Instead  the majority of families with small children now have both parents rising at dawn to commute to jobs so they can both pull in paychecks    Today the median income for a fully employed male is  41 670 per year  all numbers are inflation adjusted to 2004 dollars  nearly  800 less than his counterpart of a generation ago  The only real increase in wages for a family has come from the second paycheck earned by a working mother     Elizabeth Warren  Harvard Magazine  11    Two income earner households are far more common among the top quintile of households than the general population  2006 U S  Census Bureau data indicates that over three quarters  76   of households in the top quintile  with annual incomes exceeding  91 200  had two or more income earners compared to just 42  among the general population and a small minority in the bottom three quintiles  As a result much of the rising income inequity between the upper and lower percentiles can be explained through the increasing percentage of households with two or more incomes  11  16  Data 2003 2000 1997 1994 1991 1988 1985 1982 1979

median income of full time  year round employed workers  according to the U S  Department of Labor  The vast majority of Americans derive the majority of their income from occupational earnings  17 Income derived from an occupation is largely determined by scarcity and the economic law of supply and demand  The more demand for a certain specialty and the less supply  the higher the income  There has been shown to be a correlation between increases in income and increases in worker satisfaction  The decrease in worker dissatisfaction  however  is not solely a result of the increase in income  Workers in more complex and higher level occupations tend to have attained higher levels of education and thus are more likely to have a greater degree of autonomy in the workplace  18  Additionally higher level workers with advanced degrees are hired to share their personal knowledge  to conceptualize  and to consult  Higher level workers suffer less job alienation and reap not only external benefits in terms of income from their jobs  but also enjoy high levels of intrinsic motivation and satisfaction  7  18  In the United States the highest earning occupational group is white collar professionals  Individuals in this occupational classification tend to experience the highest job satisfaction and highest incomes  Defining income based on title of a profession is fairly inaccurate  given that a professional title may indicate the type of education received  but does not always correlate with the actual day to day income producing endeavors that are pursued  Some sources cite the profession of physician in the United States as the highest paying  7  Physician  M D and D O   compensation ranks as the highest median annual earnings of any profession  Median annual earnings ranged from  156 010 for family physicians to  321 686 for anesthesiologists  Surgeons post a median annual income of  282 504  19  However  the annual salary for Chief Executive Officer  C E O   is projected quite differently based on source  Salary com reports a median salary of  634 941  20  while the U S  Department of Labor in May 2004 reported the median as  140 350  21  This is primarily due to a methodological difference in terms of which companies were surveyed  citation needed  Overall annual earnings among the nation s top 25 professions ranged from the  70 000s to the  300 000s  In addition to physicians  lawyers  physicists  and nuclear engineers were all among the nation s 20 highest paid occupations with incomes in excess of  78 410  22  Some of the other occupations in the high five figure range were economists with a median of  72 780  23  mathematicians with  81 240  24  financial managers with  81 880  25  and software publishers with median annual earnings of

those who worked part time 4   for those with less than a ninth grade education to  100 000 for those with professional degrees   82 473 if including those who work part time 4    This median income

six figure incomes  Recent U S  Census Bureau publications indicate a strong correlation between race and affluence  In the top household income quintile  households with incomes exceeding  91 200  Asian Americans and Whites were overrepresented  whereas Hispanics and African Americans were underrepresented  The household income for Asian Americans was  at  61 094  by far the highest  28  exceeding that of Whites   48 554  by 26   29  Over a quarter  27 5   of Asian American households had incomes exceeding  100 000   and another 40  had incomes of over  75 000  30  Among White households  who remained near the national median  18 3  had six figure incomes  while 28 9  had incomes exceeding  75 000  29  The percentages of households with incomes exceeding  100 000 and  75 000 were far below the national medians for Hispanic and African American households  31  Among Hispanic households  for example  only 9  had six figure incomes  and 17  had incomes exceeding  75 000  32  The race gap remained when considering personal income  In 2005  roughly 11  of Asian Americans 33  and 7  of White individuals 34  had six figure incomes  compared to 2 6  among Hispanics 35  and 2 3  among African Americans  36  The racial breakdowns of income brackets further illustrate the racial disparities associated with affluence  in 2005  81 8  of all 114 million households were White  including White Hispanics   29  12 2  were African American  31  10 9  were Hispanic 32  and 3 7  were Asian American  28  37  While White households are always near the national median due to Whites being the by far most prevalent racial demographic  the percentages of minority households with incomes exceeding  100 000 strayed considerably from their percentage of the overall population  Asian Americans  who represent the smallest surveyed racial demographic in the overall population  were the found to be the prevalent minority among six figure income households  Among the nearly twenty million households with six figure incomes  86 9  were White  29  5 9  were Asian American  28  5 6  were Hispanic 32  and 5 5  were African American  31  Among the general individual population with earnings  82 1  were White  34  12 7  were Hispanic  35  11 0  were African American 36  and 4 6  were Asian American  33  Of the top 10  of income earners  those nearly 15 million individuals with incomes exceeding  77 500  Whites and Asians were once again overrepresented with the percentages of African Americans and Hispanics trailing behind considerably  Of the top 10  of earners  86 7  were White  34  Asian Americans were the prevalent minority  constituting 6 8  of top 10  income earners  nearly twice the percentage of Asian Americans among the general population  33  Hispanics  who were the prevalent minority in the general population of income earners  constituted only 5 2  of those in the top 10   35  with African Americans being the least represented with 5 1   36  Race

high societal status  yet income and economic compensation are a function of scarcity and act as only one of a number of indicators of social class  It is in the interest of all of society that open positions are adequately filled with a competent occupant enticed to do his or her best  7  As a result  an occupation that requires a scarce skill  the attainment of which is often documented through an educational degree  and entrusts its occupant with a high degree of influence will generally offer high economic compensation  The high income is meant to ensure that the desired individuals obtain the necessary skills  e g  medical or graduate school  and complete their tasks with the necessary valor  39  Differences in income may  however  be found among occupations of similar sociological nature  The median annual earnings of a physican were in excess of  150 000 in May 2004  compared to  95 000 for an attorney  19  22  Both occupations require finely tuned and scarce skill sets and both are essential to the well being of society  Yet  physicians outearned attorneys and other upper middle class professionals by a wide margin as their skill sets are deemed especially scarce  Overall  high status positions tend to be those requiring a scarce skill and are therefore commonly far better compensated than those in the middle of the occupational strata  7  39       It is essential that the duties of the positions be performed with the diligence that their importance requires  Inevitably  then  a society must have  first  some kind of rewards that it can use as inducements  and  second  some way of distributing these rewards differently according to positions  The rewards and their distribution become part of the social order    If the rights and prequisites of different positions in a society must be unequal  then society must be stratified    Hence every society    must differentiate persons    and must therefore possess a certain amount of institutionalized inequality     Kingsley Davis  amp  Wilbert E  Moore   Some Principles of Stratification   republished in Social Class and Stratification 39  It is important to note that the above is an ideal type  a simplified model or reality using optimal circumstances  In reality other factors such as discrimination based on race  ethnicity and gender as well as aggressive political lobbying by certain professional organizations also influence personal income  An individual s personal career decisions as well as his or her personal connections within the nation s economic institutions are also likely to have an effect on income  status and whether or not an individual may be referred to as affluent  6  In contemporary America it is a combination of all these factors  with scarcity remaining the by far most prominent one  determine a person s economic compensation  Due to higher status professions requiring advanced and thus less commonly found skill sets  including the ability to supervise and work with a considerable autonomy  are better compensated through the means of income  making high status individuals affluent  depending on reference group  7  While the two paragraphs above only describe the relationship between status and personal income  household income is also often used to infer status  As a result  the dual income phenomenon presents yet another problem in equating affluence with high societal status  As mentioned earlier in the article 42  of households have two or more income earners  76  of households with six figure incomes have two or more income earners  8  Furthermore people are most likely to marry their professional and societal equals  It therefore becomes apparent that the majority of households with incomes exceeding the six figure mark are the result of an economic as well as personal union between two economic equals  Today  two nurses  each making  55 000 a year  can easily outearn a single attorney who makes the median of  95 000 annually  22  40  Despite household income rising drastically through the union of two economic equals  neither individual has advanced his or her function and position within society  Yet the household  not individual  may have become more affluent  assuming an increase in household members does not off set the dual income derived gains  Academic Class Models Dennis

there were approximately 146 000  0 1   households with incomes exceeding  1 500 000  while the top 0 01  or 11 000 households had incomes exceeding  5 500 000  The 400 highest tax payers in the nation had gross annual household incomes exceeding  87 000 000  Household incomes for this group have risen more dramatically than for any other  As a result the gap between those who make less than one and half million dollars annually  99 9  of households  and those who make more  0 1   has been steadily increasing  prompting The New York Times to proclaim that the  Richest Are Leaving Even the Rich Far Behind   Indeed the income disparities within the top 1 5  are quite drastic  While households in the top 1 5  of households had incomes exceeding  250 000  443  above the national median  their incomes were still 2200  lower than those of the top  01  of households  One can therefore conclude that almost any household  even those with incomes of  250 000 annually are poor when compared to the top  1   who in turn are poor compared to the top 0 000267   the top 400 taxpaying households  41   edit  See also Wikimedia Commons has media related to  Income distribution in the United
