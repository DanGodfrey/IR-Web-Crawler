Trevor von EedenDick GiordanoJim AparoPhil HesterAnde Parks Green Arrow is a fictional character  a superhero that appears in comic books published by DC Comics  Created by Mort Weisinger and George Papp  he first appeared in More Fun Comics  73 in November 1941  His secret identity is Oliver Queen  billionaire and former mayor of fictional Star City  2  Dressed like Robin Hood  Green Arrow is an archer who invents trick arrows with various special functions  such as glue arrows  net  explosive  time bomb  grappling  fire extinguishing  flash and tear gas arrows  as well as cryonic  boxing glove arrows  and even a kryptonite arrow  Originally developed as an archery themed analogue of the very popular Batman character  writers at DC have developed Green Arrow into a voice of left wing and progressive politics very much distinct in character from Batman  with his own supporting cast  Throughout his first twenty five years  Green Arrow was not a significant hero  In the late 1960s  however  writer Denny O Neil chose to have him lose his fortune  giving him the then unique role of streetwise crusader for the working class and the disadvantaged  In 1970  he was paired with the more law and order oriented hero Green Lantern in a groundbreaking  socially conscious comic book series  Since then  he has been popular among comic book fans and most writers have taken an urban  gritty approach to the character  The character was killed off in the 1990s and replaced by a new character  Oliver s son Connor Hawke  the second Green Arrow  however  Hawke proved a less popular character  and the original Oliver Queen character was resurrected in the 2001  Quiver  storyline  In the 2000s  the character has been featured in bigger storylines focusing on Green Arrow and the character Black Canary  such as the DC event The Green Arrow Black Canary Wedding and the high profile Justice League  Cry for Justice storyline  the climax of which sees Green Arrow becoming a morally ambiguous anti hero  citation needed  The character was not initially a well known character outside of comic book fandom  he had appeared in a single episode of the animated series Super Friends in 1973  The character  however  became a prominent feature in the DCAU animated series Justice League Unlimited in the 2000s  reflective of his status in Justice League comic books  as well as the animated series The Batman and several DC Universe Animated Original Movies  From season six of popular live action series Smallville  in 2006  Green Arrow has been played by actor Justin Hartley  who later becomes a core cast member  he was originally introduced in a guest run as a substitute for the restricted rights character Batman  As a main character  Smallville prominently features Green Arrow supporting characters and mythos  David S  Goyer also attempted to get Green Arrow  Escape from Super Max into production as a film in the late 2000s  Contents 1 Publication

that should be changed  Art by Cliff Young  Green Arrow and Speedy first appeared in More Fun Comics  73  cover dated November 1941   which was illustrated by artist George Papp  Aside from the obvious allusions to Robin Hood  Mort Weisinger  when developing the character  was also inspired by a movie serial  The Green Archer  based on the novel by Edgar Wallace  He retooled the concept into a superhero archer with obvious Batman influences  3  These include Green Arrow s sidekick Speedy  his use of an Arrowcar and Arrowplane  his use of an Arrowcave as headquarters  his alter ego as a billionaire playboy  the use of an Arrow signal to summon him  and a clown like arch foe named Bull s Eye  similar to Batman s arch foe  the Joker  Another Weisinger created character called Aquaman also appeared for the first time in that issue  and these two back up features continued to run concurrently in More Fun Comics until the mid 1940s  and then in Adventure Comics from 1946 until 1960  Green Arrow and Speedy also appeared in various issues of World s Finest Comics until issue  140  1964   The Green Arrow and Speedy feature was one of five back up features to be promoted in one of the earliest team up books  Leading Comics  Green Arrow was one of the few DC characters to keep going after the Golden Age of Comic Books  The longevity of the character was due to the influence of creator Mort Weisinger  who kept Green Arrow and Aquaman as back up features to the headlining Superboy feature  first in More Fun Comics and then Adventure Comics  Aside from sharing Adventure Comics with him  issue  258 featured an encounter between a younger Oliver Queen and Superboy  The Green Arrow and Speedy feature during this period included a short run in 1958 written by Dick and Dave Wood and drawn by Jack Kirby  For much of this period  Green Arrow s adventures were written by France Herron  who was the character s primary scripter from 1947 1963  4   edit  Neal Adams and Dennis O Neil  1969 1983 In 1969  artist Neal Adams decided to update the character s visual appearance by giving him a Vandyke beard and costume of his own design in The Brave and the Bold  85  Aug  Sept 1969   5  Inspired by Adams  redesign  writer Dennis O Neil followed up on Green Arrow s new appearance by completely remaking the character s attitude in the pages of Justice League of America  75  cover dated November 1969   giving his personality a rougher edge  This revision was explained by having Oliver Queen lose his fortune  and then become an outspoken advocate of the underprivileged in society and the political left wing  For instance  he once saved a child s dog playing in a railyard  but instead of feeling satisfaction  he brooded on the larger problem of how the child had nowhere in the city to play safely  Green Lantern  vol  2   76  April 1970   Cover art by Neal Adams  In the early 1970s  he became a co feature with Green Lantern  Hal Jordan  in the latter s series in an acclaimed  but short lived series of stories by O Neil and Adams that dealt with various social and political issues in which Green Arrow spoke for radical change while Green Lantern was an establishment liberal figure  wanting to work within existing institutions of government and law  Where Queen advocated direct action  Hal Jordan wanted to work within the system  where Queen advocated social change  Jordan was more concerned about dealing with criminals  Each would find their beliefs challenged by the other  Queen convinced Jordan to see beyond his strict obedience to the Green Lantern Corps  to help those who were neglected or discriminated against  As O Neil explained   He would be a hot tempered anarchist to contrast with the cerebral  sedate model citizen who was the Green Lantern   6  The duo embarked on a quest to find America  witnessing the problems of corruption  racism  pollution  and overpopulation confronting the nation  Writer O Neil even took on current events  such as the Manson Family cult murders  in issues  78 79   A Kind of Loving   where Black Canary falls briefly under the spell of a false prophet who advocates violence  It was during this period that the most famous Green Arrow story appeared  in Green Lantern  vol  2   85 86  when it was revealed that Green Arrow s ward Speedy was addicted to heroin  2  In his zeal to save America  Oliver had failed in his personal responsibility to Speedy who would overcome his addiction with the help of Black Canary  Green Arrow s then love interest  This story prompted a congratulatory letter from the mayor of New York  John Lindsay  Unfortunately  the series did not match commercial expectations  and Neal Adams had trouble with deadlines  causing issue  88 to be an unscheduled reprint issue  the series was canceled with issue  89  April May 1972   The duo were moved to the back up feature in The Flash  issues  217 through  219  The socially relevant themes would continue  as the story opens with Oliver killing a criminal  albeit accidentally   Oliver shed himself of the remaining trappings of his super heroic life  including crashing the Arrowplane into a mountain  and withdrew to an ashram monastery  He would find no peace there  and returned to the outside world at the request of Hal and Dinah  This storyline would prove very important to the character in the 1990s  After this three part story  Green Lantern continued as a solo back up in The Flash  while Green Arrow s solo stories began appearing in Action Comics   My Poor Ward  Green Lantern  vol  2   86  November 1971   Cover art by Neal Adams  In 1976  the Green Lantern title was re launched starring both Hal Jordan and Ollie Queen  and the Green Arrow Green Lantern partnership returned to more traditional superhero storylines  Denny O Neill resumed writing the characters  while Adams influenced artist Mike Grell drew the feature  After the title moved to solo Green Lantern stories  solo Green Arrow stories began appearing in the World s Finest title  The solo stories were frequently written by Elliot S  Maggin  In his solo series  Oliver would land a job as a newspaper columnist  which allowed him to articulate his political beliefs in a more public field  In World s Finest  255  1979   Queen ran for Mayor of Star City and lost in a close vote  Although there was reason to believe that the election had been fixed against him  Black Canary chose for him not to contest the results legally  effectively ceding the race to his opponent  In May through August 1983  Green Arrow appeared for the first time in his own comic book  a four issue limited series 7  of murder and betrayal that established potential for a full series  It was in this miniseries that Green Arrow would gain a running rivalry with the super villain Count Vertigo  In 1985  a Green Arrow died in the Crisis on Infinite Earths  wearing red boots and gloves  suggesting this was a leftover Earth 2 character being disposed of  especially considering no resurrection was later acknowledged before his further appearances   edit  Longbow Hunters Mike Grell Ongoing See also  Green Arrow  The Longbow Hunters Green Arrow  The Longbow Hunters  1  the gritty redefinition of the Green Arrow  Cover by Mike Grell  In 1987  DC Comics launched the character into a new ongoing title as part of their mature audience comic line  Written and illustrated by Mike Grell  the revamp was launched with Green Arrow  The Longbow Hunters mini series  8  In this three issue prestige format limited series  a routine adventure against a group of drug runners led to tragedy as Black Canary was captured and brutally tortured  In response  Green Arrow murders his girlfriend s attackers  The mini series would also introduce the enigmatic female Japanese archer  Shado  whose family suffered in a World War II internment camp  Under Grell  Green Arrow would abandon the use of his trademark gadget arrows and relocate from Star City to Seattle  Washington  As the series was part of DC Comics  mature audience line  it took on a more gritty  violent  and urban tone  with Green Arrow often using deadly force against his enemies  Grell wrote the series for the first 80 issues  downplaying the super hero aspects of the characters  Oliver abandoned his mask and was never actually referred to as  Green Arrow   and Black Canary was never shown using her sonic scream power  sometimes explained as having lost it due to the events of The Longbow Hunters  though this was not consistent with her appearances in other titles published during this period   While crossover specials were conceived to allow other writers  most notably Denny O Neil  who wrote Batman and the mature audience comic The Question  to use Green Arrow  Grell wrote him as largely isolated from the rest of the DC Universe  when other DC characters like longtime friend Hal Jordan  a k a  Green Lantern  appeared  they did so in street clothes and used only their civilian names  9  In place of the super hero community  Grell created his own supporting cast  In addition to Shado  Grell introduced Seattle police Lieutenant Jim Cameron  who was disgusted with Green Arrow s vigilante actions  including killing criminals   renegade CIA agent Greg Osborne  who began to monitor Queen s activities  and mercenary Eddie Fyers  initially introduced as Queen s adversary  but later to become a companion of necessity when Green Arrow was forced to leave Seattle after false accusations of aiding terrorists  Grell s run ended with Green Arrow  80  shortly after Dinah dumped Oliver  During this period  the writer also redefined the character s origin in the four part 1992 limited series  Green Arrow  The Wonder Year  Grell portrayed Oliver Queen as a thrill seeker who inherits his family business at a very young age  Changed by his sojourn on the island  Oliver decided to take up crime fighting as a means of rebelling against his responsibilities  During his first adventure in Star City  Oliver Queen meets an old flame  Brianna Stone  a former college radical who warns him if he continued to carry his bow  he would one day have to use it for real  Grell s limited series also established Queen s attraction toward dangerous women   edit  Post Grell Once Grell left the series  DC almost immediately began restoring Green Arrow to the mainstream DC Universe  His ongoing series  mostly written by Kelley Puckett and drawn by artist Jim Aparo  was removed from the  Mature Audience  line  which had evolved into  Vertigo   with  63  prior to Grell s departure  and Green Arrow began appearing in various super hero titles as a guest  most notably Green Lantern  47  which had Oliver aiding Green Lantern in rescuing his longtime girlfriend Carol Ferris and her family from one of Hal s enemies  and the 1994 DC Comics mini series Zero Hour  In Zero Hour  Queen is forced to shoot his old friend at a pivotal moment  Now tightly integrated in the DC Universe  the character Connor Hawke was introduced and revealed as Oliver Queen s son  Connor Hawke and Oliver Queen on the cover to Green Arrow Secret Files  amp  Origins  1  December 2002   Art by Matt Wagner  In Green Arrow  100 101  Oliver would infiltrate a group of eco terrorists known as the Eden Corps and sacrifice his life in order to prevent the group from detonating a bomb that would destroy the city of Metropolis 2   the resulting explosion completely atomising Queen s body so that his identity could only be confirmed by Superman witnessing his death  This allowed the writers to shake up the status quo by making Connor Hawke a replacement Green Arrow  The series  now written by Chuck Dixon  would continue  with Hawke as the main focus until issue  137  when the series was cancelled   edit  Smith  Hester and Parks Meltzer 2000 2004 See also  Quiver  comics  Promotional for Green Arrow  vol  3   1 cover  Art by Matt Wagner  In 2000  Oliver Queen is revived in a new series  Green Arrow  vol  3   in the story arc  Quiver   written by Kevin Smith and illustrated by Phil Hester and Ande Parks  Picking up the thread from  The Final Night   Smith reveals that Hal s resurrection of Oliver was a flawed one Template Clarity in that Hal opted to resurrect Oliver in a form that had no memory of the events of The Longbow Hunters mini series or of the subsequent events that followed  up until his death  His resurrection is used by the grandfather of Stanley Dover in an attempt to gain power over Stanley s monster  At the climax of the story  Oliver s soul returns from heaven  his earthly duplicate not possessing a soul   and helps his son Connor Hawke fight a horde of demons  Dover is defeated and actually consumed by the Beast  who then leaves of his own accord  Oliver also finds himself independently wealthy again  as Dover had transferred all his financial assets to Oliver in anticipation of taking over his body  He also picked up a new sidekick  Mia Dearden  who would become the new Speedy  under Oliver s tutoring  10  After the resurrection storyline  Smith wrote a second and shorter arc involving a super powered serial killer named Onomatopoeia that sought to claim Connor Hawke as his latest victim  Smith then left the title  and Brad Meltzer took over as writer  Meltzer went on to write the mini series Identity Crisis  which heavily featured Green Arrow as one of the story s main characters  Meltzer s single storyline for Green Arrow featured Oliver and former sidekick Roy Harper reuniting and going on a cross country road trip to pick up old possessions of Oliver s  most notably a spare Green Lantern power ring entrusted to him by Hal Jordan many years earlier  The story also revealed that Oliver knew all along that Connor Hawke was his son and was even present at his birth  but that Oliver ultimately abandoned Connor and his mother  because of his fear of the responsibilities of fatherhood  Meltzer s storyline would continue into the mini series Green Lantern  Rebirth  which featured Oliver s attempts to use the ring  During this time  the character also appeared in a number of other titles  such as the Justice League and Justice League Elite  This series is notable for showing a brief affair with Dawn  the wife of the team s magical expert Manitou Raven   edit  Judd Winick  2004 2008 Judd Winick took over as Green Arrow writer and made many changes  Mia Dearden  the new Speedy  was revealed to be HIV positive  and attempts were made to expand Green Arrow s Rogues Gallery with Merlyn the archer  Constantine Drakon  and Danny Brickwell  the Brick  joining the cast of existing Green Arrow villains such as the illusion casting Count Vertigo and the enigmatic Onomatopoeia  himself a relatively recent addition   Other DC villains  such as the Riddler  made guest appearances throughout his run  In 2006 Andy Diggle and Jock s Green Arrow  Year One 11  presented the most recent official version of his origin  Using concepts from previous iterations  Oliver Queen is a rich  thrill seeking activist who is attacked  thrown overboard  and washes up on a island where he learns of a smuggling operation  Upon witnessing the inhabitants  slave like living conditions  he begins to take down the smugglers  operation  He eventually returns to civilization changed by his experiences  In the final part of the story  Oliver claims that a mutiny or the actions of a group of heroin dealers could be used as a cover story for what transpired  referencing the original Green Arrow origin story  as well as Mike Grell s version  That year also saw the title  along with other DC comics titles  jump  One Year Later  after the events in Infinite Crisis   Oliver  having once again amassed a large personal fortune  is the newly elected mayor of Star City  He continues his fight for justice both on the streets and within the political system  He also has a new costume  which appears to be a combination of the classic Neal Adams costume and the Mike Grell Longbow Hunters costume  In flashbacks  it is revealed that Oliver survived a near fatal attack during the events of Infinite Crisis  and used his recuperation time to retrain  He works with several expert instructors including a sensei known as Natas  who also trained Deathstroke  The current Green Arrow  vol  3  series ended with issue  75 in June 2007  concluding with the character  having resigned as mayor after a scandal  proposing to Dinah  Black Canary    edit  Green Arrow Black Canary Main article  Green Arrow and Black Canary After the end of the ongoing series  DC Comics published a four part bi monthly Black Canary miniseries in which Green Arrow teamed up with Black Canary to help get Sin into school and establish a new life  This series concluded with Black Canary accepting his proposal  This resulted in DC Comics publishing three interconnected specials revolving around the Green Arrow Black Canary wedding that tied into that month s  Countdown  stories  These were The Black Canary Wedding Planner  JLA Wedding Special  and The Green Arrow Black Canary Wedding Special  The wedding special worked as a lead in for a new Green Arrow Black Canary series  At the conclusion of the wedding special  Black Canary is forced to kill Green Arrow after he appears to go mad and attacks her  The new ongoing series picked up on this  quickly revealing that Green Arrow was alive  the dead Green Arrow being an impostor  and being held hostage by  Athena   Black Canary  Connor and Mia launch a rescue mission to save Green Arrow  As the team is united  and on their way to safety  Connor is struck by a bullet meant for Oliver  and is left in a vegetative state  While Connor rests  Oliver and Dinah go out and officially become married  since they never actually were married in the Wedding Special  but come home to find Connor has been kidnapped  This storyline led directly into the second arc that followed the rescue of Connor Hawke from a mysterious foe  Connor is eventually found  now having recovered thanks to manipulation by Doctor Sivana  With issue  15

arrows for his adventures  20   edit  Other versions One armed Green Arrow in The Dark Knight Returns  Many alternative versions of the character have appeared in DC Comics publications  The original version of the character became established as the Earth Two version of Green Arrow who was a member of the Seven Soldiers of Victory and All Star Squadron in the 1940s  along with his sidekick Speedy  Aside from their origin  which states the two were trained together on a mesa top  their history nearly parallels the history of the Earth One version  up until the point when Green Arrow and Speedy  along with their teammates  were thrown into various periods of time during a battle with the Nebula Man  He was killed during the Crisis on Infinite Earths  A retcon was made  in Crisis on Infinite Earths  that the Earth Two Green Arrow had brown hair  as opposed to Earth One s Green Arrow being blond  Similarly  the Earth Two Speedy has blond hair  as opposed to Earth One s Speedy having red  The character appears in Frank Miller s Batman  The Dark Knight Returns and the sequel Batman  The Dark Knight Strikes Again  Despite missing an arm  implied to be because of Superman   Oliver still proves to be an effective archer  he grasps the nocks of his arrows in his teeth   The Emerald Archer later acquires a cybernetic replacement for his lost arm from Batman in the sequel  The death scene in Green Arrow  100 101 pays tribute to Miller s story  Superman s only course of action to rescue Green Arrow is by removing his arm  but Queen refuses to let him admitting later in Quiver that he refused due to both his own issues at this point in his life and the more practical issue that he would be useless as an archer with one arm thus bringing about his apparent death  In The Dark Knight Returns  Queen is portrayed as an anarchist  while in The Dark Knight Strikes Again he is explicitly described as a  billionaire turned Communist   An older  balding Green Arrow would appear in Mark Waid and Alex Ross  futuristic vision Kingdom Come  where Oliver has joined forces with Batman to oppose Superman s army  He married his long time love Dinah Lance and they have a daughter

gain their weapons back  Shocked by her revelation  Oliver had only been stalling before his daughter is killed by his reserve teams he earlier called  23   edit  Green Arrow and Warlord Mike Grell s Warlord character  Travis Morgan  bears a striking resemblance to Oliver Queen  During Grell s run on Green Arrow  Travis Morgan shows up in Seattle in issue  27  After being attacked on sight by half of the Seattle underworld population  all of whom mistake him for Green Arrow   Morgan shows up at Queen s house and declares   Whatever you ve been doing to piss these people off    cut it out    Finally appearing on panel together  Grell illustrates that while there is an uncanny resemblance  Travis Morgan is significantly taller than Oliver  and seemingly several years older  In Aquaman  vol  5   71  Aquaman accidentally passes through a dimensional portal that leads to Skartaris  the world of Warlord  When he meets Travis Morgan  he mistakes him for Oliver back from the dead  this was after Oliver had been killed by a terrorist s bomb  and before he was resurrected by Hal Jordan   2  During Kevin Smith s Green Arrow run  during the  Quiver  story arc  Deadman pokes fun at the
