primarily by the United States of America  with contributions from allied nations under the aegis of the United Nations  and the Democratic People s Republic of Korea  supported by the People s Republic of China  with military and material aid from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics   The Korean War was primarily the result of the political division of Korea by an agreement of the victorious Allies at the conclusion of the Pacific War at the end of World War II  The Korean peninsula was ruled by the Empire of Japan from 1910 until the end of World War II  Following the surrender of the Empire of Japan in September 1945  American administrators divided the peninsula along the 38th parallel  with U S  military forces occupying the southern half and Soviet military forces occupying the northern half  11  The failure to hold free elections throughout the Korean Peninsula in 1948 deepened the division between the two sides  the North established a communist government  while the South established a capitalist one  The 38th parallel increasingly became a political border between the two Korean states  Although reunification negotiations continued in the months preceding the war  tension intensified  Cross border skirmishes and raids at the 38th Parallel persisted  The situation escalated into open warfare when North Korean forces invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950  12  It was the first significant armed conflict of the Cold War  13  In 1950 the Soviet Union boycotted the United Nations security council  in protest at representation of China by the Kuomintang   Republic of China government  which had taken refuge in Taiwan following defeat in the Chinese Civil War  In the absence of a dissenting voice from the Soviet Union  who could have vetoed it  USA and other countries passed a security council resolution authorizing military intervention in Korea  The United States of America  88  of foreign troops  and other members of the United Nations force  12  of foreign troops   came to the aid of South Korea in repelling the invasion  but within two months the defenders were pushed back to the Pusan perimeter  a small area in the south of the country  before the North Koreans were stopped  A rapid U N  counter offensive then drove the North Koreans past the 38th Parallel and almost to the Yalu River  and it was then that the People s Republic of China  PRC  entered the war on the side of North Korea  12  The Chinese launched a counter offensive that pushed the United Nations forces back across the 38th Parallel  The Soviet Union materially aided the North Korean and Chinese armies  The active stage of the war ended on 27 July 1953  when the armistice agreement was signed  The agreement restored the border between the Koreas near the 38th Parallel and created the Korean Demilitarized Zone  DMZ   a 2 5 mile  4 0 km  wide buffer zone between the two Koreas  Minor outbreaks of fighting continue to the present day  With both North Korea and South Korea sponsored by external powers  the Korean War was a proxy war  From a military science perspective  it combined strategies and tactics of World War I and World War II  it began with a mobile campaign of swift infantry attacks followed by air bombing raids  but became a static trench war by July 1951  Contents 1 Background 1 1 Terminology 1 2 Japanese rule  1910 1945  1

Background Terminology In the United States  the war was initially described by President Harry S  Truman as a  police action  as it was conducted under the auspices of the United Nations  14  Colloquially  it has been referred to in the United States as The Forgotten War or The Unknown War because the issues concerned were much less clear than in previous and subsequent conflicts  such as World War II and the Vietnam War  15  16  In South Korea the war is usually referred to as  625  or the 6 2 5 Upheaval  yug i o dongnan   reflecting the date of its commencement on 25 June  17  In North Korea the war is officially referred to as the Fatherland Liberation War  Choguk haebang ch njaeng   Alternatively  it is called the Chos n ch njaeng   Chos n war   Chos n being what North Koreans call Korea   18  In the People s Republic of China the war is called the War to Resist U S  Aggression and Aid Korea  traditional Chinese          simplified Chinese          pinyin  K ngm iyu

1945  Main article  Korea under Japanese rule Upon defeating the Qing Dynasty in the First Sino Japanese War  1894 96   the Empire of Japan occupied the Korean Empire   a peninsula strategic to its sphere of influence  21  A decade later  defeating Imperial Russia in the Russo Japanese War  1904 05   Japan made Korea its protectorate with the Eulsa Treaty in 1905  then annexed it with the Japan Korea Annexation Treaty in 1910  22  Korean nationalists and the intelligentsia fled the country  and some founded the Provisional Korean Government in 1919  which was headed by Syngman Rhee in Shanghai  This government in exile was recognized by few countries  From 1919 to 1925 and beyond  Korean communists led and were the primary agents of internal and external warfare against the Japanese  23  24  Korea under Japanese rule was considered to be part of the Empire of Japan as an industrialized colony along with Taiwan  and both were part of the Greater East Asia Co Prosperity Sphere  In 1937  the colonial Governor General  General Jir  Minami  commanded the attempted cultural assimilation of Korea s 23 5 million people by banning the use and study of Korean language  literature  and culture  to be replaced with that of mandatory use and study of their Japanese counterparts  Starting in 1939  the populace was required to use Japanese names under the S shi kaimei policy  In 1938  the Colonial Government established labor conscription  citation needed  In China  the National Revolutionary Army and the Communist People s Liberation Army helped organize refugee Korean patriots and independence fighters against the Japanese military  which had also occupied parts of China  The Nationalist backed Koreans  led by Yi Pom Sok  fought in the Burma Campaign  December 1941   August 1945   The Communists  led by Kim Il sung  fought the Japanese in Korea and Manchuria  citation needed  During World War II  the Japanese used Korea s food  livestock  and metals for their war effort  Japanese forces in Korea increased from 46 000 soldiers in 1941 to 300 000 in 1945  Japanese Korea conscripted 2 6 million forced laborers controlled with a collaborationist Korean police force  some 723 000 people were sent to work in the overseas empire and in metropolitan Japan  By 1942  Korean men were being conscripted into the Imperial Japanese Army  By January 1945  Koreans comprised 32  of Japan s labor force  In August 1945  when the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki  around 25  of those killed were Koreans  24  At the end of the war  other world powers did not recognize Japanese rule in Korea and Taiwan  Meanwhile  at the Cairo Conference  November 1943   Nationalist China  the United Kingdom  and the United States decided  in due course Korea shall become free and independent   25  Later  the Yalta Conference  February 1945  granted to the Soviet Union European  buffer zones  satellite states accountable to Moscow as well as an expected Soviet pre eminence in China and Manchuria  in return for joining the Allied Pacific War effort against Japan  26  Soviet invasion of Manchuria  1945  Main article  Soviet invasion of Manchuria  1945  Toward the end of World War II  as per a US Soviet agreement  the USSR declared war against Japan on 9 August 1945  24  27  By 10 August  the Red Army occupied the northern part of the Korean peninsula as agreed  and on 26 August halted at the 38th parallel for three weeks to await the arrival of US forces in the south  28  On 10 August 1945  with the 15 August Japanese surrender near  the Americans doubted whether the Soviets would honor their part of the Joint Commission  the US sponsored Korean occupation agreement  A month earlier  Colonel Dean Rusk and Colonel Charles H  Bonesteel III divided the Korean peninsula at the 38th parallel after hurriedly deciding that the US Korean Zone of Occupation had to have a minimum of two ports  29  30  31  32  Explaining why the occupation zone demarcation was positioned at the 38th parallel  Rusk observed   even though it was further north than could be realistically reached by US forces  in the event of Soviet disagreement     we felt it important to include the capital of Korea in the area of responsibility of American troops   especially when  faced with the scarcity of US forces immediately available  and time and space factors  which would make it difficult to reach very far north  before Soviet troops could enter the area   26  The Soviets agreed to the US occupation zone demarcation to improve their negotiating position regarding the occupation zones in Eastern Europe  and because each would accept Japanese surrender where they stood  33  Chinese Civil War  1945 1949  Main article  Chinese Civil War After the end of Second Sino Japanese War  the Chinese Civil War resumed between the Chinese Communists and the Chinese Nationalists  While the Communists were struggling for supremacy in Manchuria  they were supported by the North Korean government with materiel and manpower  34  According to Chinese sources  the North Koreans donated 2 000 railway cars worth of material while thousands of Korean  volunteers  served in the Chinese People s Liberation Army  PLA  during the war  35  North Korea also provided the Chinese Communists in Manchuria with a safe refuge for non combatants and communications with the rest of China  34  The North Korean contributions to the Chinese Communist victory were not forgotten after the creation of the People s Republic of China in 1949  As a token of gratitude  between 50 000 to 70 000 Korean veterans that served in the PLA were sent back along with their weapons  and they would later play a significant role in the initial invasion of South Korea  34  China promised to support the North Koreans in the event of a war against South Korea  36  The Chinese support created a deep division between the Korean Communists  and Kim Il Sung s authority within the Communist party was challenged by the Chinese faction led by Pak Il yu  who was later purged by Kim  37  After the formation of the People s Republic of China in 1949  the Chinese government named the Western nations  led by the United States  as the biggest threat to its national security  38  Basing this judgment on China s century of humiliation beginning in the early 19th century  39  American support for the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War  40  and the ideological struggles between revolutionaries and reactionaries  41  the Chinese leadership believed that China would become a critical battleground in the United States  crusade against Communism  42  As a countermeasure and to elevate China s standing among the worldwide Communist movements  the Chinese leadership adopted a foreign policy that actively promoted Communist revolutions throughout territories on China s periphery  43  Korea divided  1945 1949  See also  Division of Korea At the Potsdam Conference  July August 1945   the Allies unilaterally decided to divide Korea without consulting the Koreans in contradiction of the Cairo Conference  44  45  46  47  On 8 September 1945  Lt  Gen  John R  Hodge of the United States arrived in Incheon to accept the Japanese surrender south of the 38th parallel  30  Appointed as military governor  General Hodge directly controlled South Korea via the United States Army Military Government in Korea  USAMGIK 1945 48   48  He established control by restoring to power the key Japanese colonial administrators and their Korean police collaborators  13  The USAMGIK refused to recognise the provisional government of the short lived People s Republic of Korea  PRK  because he suspected it was communist  These policies  voiding popular Korean sovereignty  provoked civil insurrections and guerrilla warfare  22  On 3 September 1945  Lieutenant General Yoshio Kozuki  Commander  Japanese Seventeenth Area Army  contacted Hodge  telling him that the Soviets were south of the 38th parallel at Kaesong  Hodge trusted the accuracy of the Japanese Army report 30  In December 1945  Korea was administered by a US USSR Joint Commission  as agreed at the Moscow Conference  1945   The Koreans were excluded from the talks  The commission decided the country would become independent after a five year trusteeship action facilitated by each r gime sharing its sponsor s ideology  49  50  The Korean populace revolted  in the south  some protested  and some rose in arms  22  to contain them  the USAMGIK banned strikes on 8 December 1945 and outlawed the PRK Revolutionary Government and the PRK People s Committees on 12 December 1945  On 23 September 1946 an 8 000 strong railroad worker strike began in Pusan  Civil disorder spread throughout the country in what became known as the Autumn uprising  On 1 October 1946  Korean police killed three students in the Daegu Uprising  protesters counter attacked  killing 38 policemen  On 3 October  some 10 000 people attacked the Yeongcheon police station  killing three policemen and injuring some 40 more  elsewhere  some 20 landlords and pro Japanese South Korean officials were killed  51  The USAMGIK declared martial law  The right wing Representative Democratic Council  led by nationalist Syngman Rhee  opposed the Soviet American trusteeship of Korea  arguing that after 35 years  1910 45  of Japanese colonial rule most Koreans opposed another foreign occupation  The USAMGIK decided to forego the five year trusteeship agreed upon in Moscow  given the 31 March 1948 United Nations election deadline to achieve an anti communist civil government in the US Korean Zone of Occupation  On 3 April what began as a demonstration commemorating Korean resistance to Japanese rule ended with the Jeju massacre of as many as 60 000 citizens by South Korean soldiers  52  On 10 May  South Korea convoked their first national general elections that the Soviets first opposed  then boycotted  insisting that the US honor the trusteeship agreed to at the Moscow Conference  53  54  North Korea held parliamentary elections three months later on 25 August 1948  55  The resultant anti communist South Korean government promulgated a national political constitution on 17 July 1948  elected a president  the American educated strongman Syngman Rhee on 20 July 1948  The elections were marred by terrorism and sabotage resulting in 600 deaths  56  The Republic of Korea  South Korea  was established on 15 August 1948  In the Russian Korean Zone of Occupation  the USSR established a Communist North Korean government 53  led by Kim Il sung  57  President Rhee s r gime expelled communists and leftists from southern national politics  Disenfranchised  they headed for the hills  to prepare for guerrilla war against the US sponsored ROK Government  57  As nationalists  both Syngman Rhee and Kim Il Sung were intent upon reunifying Korea under their own political system  58  With Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong fighting over the control of the Korean Peninsula  59  the North Koreans gained support from both the Soviet Union and the People s Republic of China  They escalated the continual border skirmishes and raids and then prepared to invade  South Korea  with limited mat riel  could not match them  58  During this era  at the beginning of the Cold War  the US government assumed that all communists  regardless of nationality  were controlled or directly influenced by Moscow  thus the US portrayed the civil war in Korea as a Soviet hegemonic maneuver  60  In October 1948  South Korean left wing soldiers rebelled against the government s harsh clampdown in April on Jeju island in the Yeosu Suncheon Rebellion  61  The Soviet Union withdrew as agreed from Korea in 1948  U S  troops withdrew from Korea in 1949  leaving the South Korean army relatively ill equipped  On 24 December 1949  South Korean forces killed 86 to 88 people in the Mungyeong massacre and blamed the crime on communist marauding bands  62  63  Course of the war The conflict begins  June 1950  The neutrality of this section is disputed  Please see the discussion on the talk page  Please do not remove this message until the dispute is resolved   March 2012  Territory often changed hands early in the war  until the front stabilized  In April 1950 Kim Il sung travelled to Moscow and secured Stalin s support for a policy to unify Korea under his authority  Although agreeing with the invasion of South Korea in principle  Stalin refused to become directly involved in Kim s plans  and advised Kim to enlist Chinese support instead  In May 1950 Kim visited Beijing  and succeeded in gaining Mao s endorsement  At the time  Mao s support for Kim was largely political  he was contemplating the invasions citation needed  of Taiwan and Tibet   and was unaware of Kim s precise intentions or the timing of Kim s attack  When the Korean war broke out  the Chinese were in the process of demobilizing half of the PLA s 5 6 million soldiers  64  On 7 June 1950  Kim Il sung called for an election in whole Korea on 5 8 Aug  1950 and a consultative conference in Haeju on 15 17 June 1950  On June 11  the North sent 3 diplomat to the South  who were later arrested by the South  Fourteen days later on 25 June 1950  the North Korean People s Army  KPA  crossed the 38th parallel border and invaded South Korea  Under the guise of counter attacking a South Korean provocation raid  the KPA crossed the 38th parallel behind artillery fire at dawn on Sunday 25 June 1950  65  The KPA said that Republic of Korea Army  ROK Army  troops  under command of the r gime of the  bandit traitor Syngman Rhee   had crossed the border first  and that they would arrest and execute Rhee  30  Both Korean armies had continually harassed each other with skirmishes and each continually staged raids across the 38th parallel border  On 27 June  Rhee evacuated from Seoul with government officials  Rhee ordered the Bodo League massacre  which started on 28 June  66  67  68  On 28 June  South Korea bombed the bridge across the Han River to stop the North Korean army  69  Early on in the fighting  South Korea put its forces under the authority of the United Nations Command  Korea   70  Factors in US intervention The Truman Administration was caught at a crossroads  Before the invasion  Korea was not included in the strategic Asian Defense Perimeter outlined by Secretary of State Acheson  71  Military strategists were more concerned with the security of Europe against the Soviet Union than East Asia  At the same time  the Administration was worried that a war in Korea could quickly widen into another world war should the Chinese or Soviets decide to get involved as well  One facet of the changing attitude toward Korea and whether to get involved was Japan  Especially after the fall of China to the Communists      Japan itself increasingly appeared as the major East Asian prize to be protected   US East Asian experts saw Japan as the critical counterweight to the Soviet Union and China in the region  While there was no United States policy that dealt with South Korea directly as a national interest  its proximity to Japan pushed South Korea to the fore   The recognition that the security of Japan required a non hostile Korea led directly to President Truman s decision to intervene    The essential point    is that the American response to the North Korean attack stemmed from considerations of US policy toward Japan   72  The United States wanted to shore up Japan to make it a viable counterweight against the Soviet Union and China  and Korea was seen as integral to that end  The other important part of committing to intervention lay in speculation about Soviet action in the event that the United States intervene  The Truman administration was fretful that a war in Korea was a diversionary assault that would escalate to a general war in Europe once the US committed in Korea  At the same time    t here was no suggestion from anyone that the United Nations or the United States could back away from  the conflict    73  In Truman s mind  this aggression  if left unchecked  would start a chain reaction that would destroy the United Nations and give the go ahead to further Communist aggression elsewhere  Korea was where a stand had to be made  the difficult part was how  The UN Security council approved the use of force to help the South Koreans and the US immediately began using air and naval forces in the area to that end  The Administration still refrained from committing on the ground because some advisors believed the North Koreans could be stopped by air and naval power alone  74  Also  it was still uncertain if this was a clever ploy by the Soviet Union to catch the US unawares or just a test of US resolve  The decision to commit ground troops and to intervene eventually became viable when a communiqu  was received on 27 June from the Soviet Union that alluded it would not move against US forces in Korea   This opened the way for the sending of American ground forces  for it now seemed less likely that a general war with Korea as a preliminary diversion was imminent   75  With the Soviet Union s tacit agreement that this would not cause an escalation  the United States now could intervene with confidence that other commitments would not be jeopardized  United Nations Security Council Resolutions On 25 June 1950  the United Nations Security Council unanimously condemned the North Korean invasion of the Republic of Korea  with United Nations Security Council Resolution 82  The USSR  a veto wielding power  had boycotted the Council meetings since January 1950  protesting that the Republic of China  Taiwan   not the People s Republic of China  held a permanent seat in the UN Security Council  76  After debating the matter  the Security Council  on 27 June 1950  published Resolution 83 recommending member states provide military assistance to the Republic of Korea  On 27 June President Truman ordered US air and sea forces to help the South Korean r gime  On 4 July the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister accused the US of starting armed intervention on behalf of South Korea  77  The USSR challenged the legitimacy of the war for several reasons  The ROK Army intelligence upon which Resolution 83 was based came from US Intelligence  North Korea was not invited as a sitting temporary member of the UN  which violated UN Charter Article 32  and the Korean conflict was beyond UN Charter scope  because the initial north south border fighting was classed as a civil war  The Soviet representative boycotted the UN to prevent Security Council action  and to challenge the legitimacy of the UN action  legal scholars posited that deciding upon an action of this type required the unanimous vote of the five permanent members  78  79  Comparison of military forces In early 1951 USAF recruits arrived by the train load  more than doubling the population of Lackland AFB  By mid 1950 North Korean forces numbered between 150 000 and 200 000 troops  organized into 10 infantry divisions  one tank division  and one air force division  with 210 fighter planes and 280 tanks who captured scheduled objectives and territory  among them Kaesong  Chuncheon  Uijeongbu  and Ongjin  Their forces included 274 T 34 85 tanks  some 150 Yak fighters  110 attack bombers  200 artillery pieces  78 Yak trainers  and 35 reconnaissance aircraft  30  In addition to the invasion force  the North Korean KPA had 114 fighters  78 bombers  105 T 34 85 tanks  and some 30 000 soldiers stationed in reserve in North Korea  30  Although each navy consisted of only several small warships  the North Korean and South Korean navies fought in the war as sea borne artillery for their in country armies  In contrast  the ROK Army defenders were vastly unprepared  and the political establishment in the south  while well aware of the threat to the north  were unable to convince American administrators of the reality of the threat  In South to the Naktong  North to the Yalu  1961   R E  Appleman reports the ROK forces  low combat readiness as of 25 June 1950  The ROK Army had 98 000 soldiers  65 000 combat  33 000 support   no tanks  they had been requested from the US military  but requests were denied   and a 22 piece air force comprising 12 liaison type and 10 AT6 advanced trainer airplanes  There were no large foreign military garrisons in Korea at invasion time  but there were large US garrisons and air forces in Japan  30  Within days of the invasion  masses of ROK Army soldiers of dubious loyalty to the Syngman Rhee r gime were either retreating southwards or were defecting en masse to the northern side  the KPA  23  United Nations response  July   August 1950  A US howitzer position near the Kum River  15 July  A GI comforts a grieving infantryman  Despite the rapid post Second World War Allied demobilizations  there were substantial US forces occupying Japan  under General Douglas MacArthur s command  they could be made ready to fight the North Koreans  80  Only the British Commonwealth had comparable forces in the area  On Saturday  24 June 1950  US Secretary of State Dean Acheson informed President Truman by telephone   Mr  President  I have very serious news  The North Koreans have invaded South Korea   81  82  Truman and Acheson discussed a US invasion response with defense department principals  who agreed that the United States was obligated to repel military aggression  paralleling it with Adolf Hitler s 1930s aggressions  and said that the mistake of appeasement must not be repeated  83  In his autobiography  President Truman acknowledged that fighting the invasion was essential to the American goal of the global containment of communism as outlined in the National Security Council Report 68  NSC 68   declassified in 1975   Communism was acting in Korea  just as Hitler  Mussolini and the Japanese had ten  fifteen  and twenty years earlier  I felt certain that if South Korea was allowed to fall Communist leaders would be emboldened to override nations closer to our own shores  If the Communists were permitted to force their way into the Republic of Korea without opposition from the free world  no small nation would have the courage to resist threat and aggression by stronger Communist neighbors  84  President Truman announced that the US would counter  unprovoked aggression  and  vigorously support the effort of the  UN  security council to terminate this serious breach of peace   82  In Congress  the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Omar Bradley warned against appeasement  saying that Korea was the place  for drawing the line  against communist expansion  In August 1950  the President and the Secretary of State obtained the consent of Congress to appropriate  12 billion to pay for the military expenses  82  Per State Secretary Acheson s recommendation  President Truman ordered General MacArthur to transfer materiel to the Army of the Republic of Korea while giving air cover to the evacuation of US nationals  The President disagreed with advisors who recommended unilateral US bombing of the North Korean forces  and ordered the US Seventh Fleet to protect the Republic of China  Taiwan   whose Nationalist Government asked to fight in Korea  The US denied the Nationalist Chinese request for combat  lest it provoke a communist Chinese retaliation  85  Because the US had sent the Seventh Fleet to  neutralize  the Taiwan Strait  Chinese premier Zhou Enlai criticized both the UN and US initiatives as  armed aggression on Chinese territory   86  The Battle of Osan  the first significant American engagement of the Korean War  involved the 540 soldier Task Force Smith  which was a small forward element of the 24th Infantry Division  87  On 5 July 1950  Task Force Smith attacked the North Koreans at Osan but without weapons capable of destroying the North Koreans  tanks  They were unsuccessful  the result was 180 dead  wounded  or taken prisoner  The KPA progressed southwards  pushing back the US force at Pyongtaek  Chonan  and Chochiwon  forcing the 24th Division s retreat to Taejeon  which the KPA captured in the Battle of Taejon  88  the 24th Division suffered 3 602 dead and wounded and 2 962 captured  including the Division s Commander  Major General William F  Dean  88  Overhead  the KPAF shot down 18 USAF fighters and 29 bombers  the USAF shot down five KPAF fighters  citation needed  By August  the KPA had pushed back the ROK Army and the Eighth United States Army to the vicinity of Pusan  in southeast Korea  89  In their southward advance  the KPA purged the Republic of Korea s intelligentsia by killing civil servants and intellectuals  90  On 20 August  General MacArthur warned North Korean leader Kim Il Sung that he was responsible for the KPA s atrocities  90  By September  the UN Command controlled only the Pusan perimeter  enclosing only about 10  of Korea  in a line partially defined by the Nakdong River  Although Kim s early successes had led him to predict that he would end the war by the end of August  Chinese leaders were more pessimistic  To counter the possibility of American invasion  Zhou Enlai secured a Soviet commitment to have the USSR support Chinese forces with air cover  and deployed 260 000 soldiers along the Korean border  under the command of Gao Gang  Zhou commanded Chai Chengwen to conduct a topographical survey of Korea  and directed Lei Yingfu  Zhou s military advisor in Korea  to analyze the military situation in Korea  Lei concluded that MacArthur would most likely attempt a landing at Incheon  After conferring with Mao that this would be MacArthur s most likely strategy  Zhou briefed Soviet and North Korean advisers of Lei s findings  and issued orders to Chinese army commanders deployed on the Korean border to prepare for American naval activity in the Korea Strait  91  Escalation  August   September 1950  The U S  Air Force attacking railroads south of Wonsan on the eastern coast of North Korea  In the resulting Battle of Pusan Perimeter  August September 1950   the US Army withstood KPA attacks meant to capture the city at the Naktong Bulge  P ohang dong  and Taegu  The United States Air Force  USAF  interrupted KPA logistics with 40 daily ground support sorties that destroyed 32 bridges  halting most daytime road and rail traffic  KPA forces were forced to hide in tunnels by day and move only at night  92 To deny materiel to the KPA  the USAF destroyed logistics depots  petroleum refineries  and harbors  while the US Navy air forces attacked transport hubs  Consequently  the over extended KPA could not be supplied throughout the south  93  Meanwhile  US garrisons in Japan continually dispatched soldiers and materiel to reinforce defenders in the Pusan Perimeter  94  Tank battalions deployed to Korea directly from the United States mainland from the port of San Francisco to the port of Pusan  the largest Korean port  By late August  the Pusan Perimeter had some 500 medium tanks battle ready  95  In early September 1950  ROK Army and UN Command forces outnumbered the KPA 180 000 to 100 000 soldiers  The UN forces  once prepared  counterattacked and broke out of the Pusan Perimeter  21  96  Battle of Inchon  September 1950  Main article  Battle of Inchon General Douglas MacArthur  UN Command CiC  seated   observes the naval shelling of Incheon from the USS Mt  McKinley  15 September 1950  Against the rested and re armed Pusan Perimeter defenders and their reinforcements  the KPA were undermanned and poorly supplied  unlike the UN Command  they lacked naval and air support  97  To relieve the Pusan Perimeter  General MacArthur recommended an amphibious landing at Inchon  well over 100 miles  160 km  behind the KPA lines  98  On 6 July  he ordered Major General Hobart R  Gay  Commander  1st Cavalry Division  to plan the division s amphibious landing at Incheon  on 12 14 July  the 1st Cavalry Division embarked from Yokohama  Japan to reinforce the 24th Infantry Division inside the Pusan Perimeter  99  Soon after the war began  General MacArthur had begun planning a landing at Incheon  but the Pentagon opposed him  98  When authorized  he activated a combined United States Army  United States Marine Corps  and ROK Army force  The X Corps  led by General Edward Almond  Commander  consisted of 40 000 men of the 1st Marine Division  the 7th Infantry Division and around 8 600 ROK Army soldiers  100  By the 15 September attack date  the amphibious assault force faced few KPA defenders at Incheon  military intelligence  psychological warfare  guerrilla reconnaissance  and protracted bombardment facilitated a relatively light battle  However  the bombardment destroyed most of the city of Incheon  101  After the Incheon landing the 1st Cavalry Division began its northward advance from the Pusan Perimeter   Task Force Lynch  3rd Battalion  7th Cavalry Regiment  and two 70th Tank Battalion units  Charlie Company and the Intelligence Reconnaissance Platoon   effected the  Pusan Perimeter Breakout  through 106 4 miles  171 2 km  of enemy territory to join the 7th Infantry Division at Osan  99  The X Corps rapidly defeated the KPA defenders around Seoul  thus threatening to trap the main KPA force in Southern Korea  102   On 18 September Stalin dispatched General H M  Zakharov to Korea to advise Kim Il sung to halt his offensive around the Pusan perimeter and to redeploy his forces to defend Seoul  Chinese commanders were not briefed on North Korean troop numbers or operational plans  As the overall commander of Chinese forces  Zhou Enlai suggested that the North Koreans should attempt to eliminate the enemy forces at Inchon only if they had reserves of at least 100 000 men  otherwise  he advised the North Koreans to withdraw their forces north  103  On 25 September Seoul was recaptured by South Korean forces  American air raids caused heavy damage to the KPA  destroying most of its tanks and much of its artillery  North Korean troops in the south  instead of effectively withdrawing north  rapidly disintegrated  leaving Pyongyang vulnerable  103  During the general retreat only 25 000 to 30 000 soldiers managed to rejoin the Northern KPA lines  104  105  On 27 September Stalin convened an emergency session of the Politburo  in which he condemned the incompetence of the KPA command and held Soviet military advisers responsible for the defeat  103  UN forces cross partition line  September   October 1950  Main article  UN Offensive  1950 Combat in the streets of Seoul On 27 September  MacArthur received the top secret National Security Council Memorandum 81 1 from Truman reminding him that operations north of the 38th parallel were authorized only if  at the time of such operation there was no entry into North Korea by major Soviet or Chinese Communist forces  no announcements of intended entry  nor a threat to counter our operations militarily     106  On 29 September MacArthur restored the government of the Republic of Korea under Syngman Rhee  103  On 30 September  Defense Secretary George Marshall sent an eyes only message to MacArthur   We want you to feel unhampered tactically and strategically to proceed north of the 38th parallel   106  During October  the ROK police executed people who were suspected to be sympathetic to North Korea  107  On 30 September Zhou Enlai warned the United States that it was prepared to intervene in Korea if the United States crossed the 38th parallel  Zhou attempted to advise North Korean commanders on how to conduct a general withdrawal by using the same tactics which had allowed Chinese communist forces to successfully escape Chiang Kai shek s Encirclement Campaigns in the 1930s  North Korean commanders did not utilize these tactics effectively  108  By 1 October 1950  the UN Command repelled the KPA northwards  past the 38th parallel  the ROK Army crossed after them  into North Korea  109  MacArthur made a statement demanding the KPA s unconditional surrender  110  Six days later  on 7 October  with UN authorization  the UN Command forces followed the ROK forces northwards  111  The X Corps landed at Wonsan  in southeastern North Korea  and Riwon  in northeastern North Korea   already captured by ROK forces  112  The Eighth United States Army and the ROK Army drove up western Korea and captured Pyongyang city  the North Korean capital  on 19 October 1950  113  The 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team   Rakkasans   made their first of the only two combat jumps during the Korean War on 20 October 1950 at Sunchon and Sukchon  The missions of the 187th were to cut the road north going to China  preventing North Korean leaders from escaping from Pyongyang  and to rescue American prisoners of war  At month s end  UN forces held 135 000 KPA prisoners of war  Taking advantage of the UN Command s strategic momentum against the communists  General MacArthur believed it necessary to extend the Korean War into China to destroy depots supplying the North Korean war effort  President Truman disagreed  and ordered caution at the Sino Korean border  114  China intervenes  October   December 1950  Chinese forces cross the Yalu River  On 27 June 1950  two days after the KPA invaded and three months before the Chinese entered the war  President Truman dispatched the United States Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait  to protect the Nationalist Republic of China  Taiwan  from the People s Republic of China  PRC   115  On 4 August 1950  with the PRC invasion of Taiwan aborted  Mao Zedong reported to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea when the People s Liberation Army s  PLA  Taiwan invasion force was reorganized into the PLA North East Frontier Force  On 20 August 1950  Premier Zhou Enlai informed the United Nations that  Korea is China s neighbor    The Chinese people cannot but be concerned about a solution of the Korean question   Thus  via neutral country diplomats  China warned that in safeguarding Chinese national security  they would intervene against the UN Command in Korea  114  President Truman interpreted the communication as  a bald attempt to blackmail the UN   and dismissed it  116  Korean War flying aces 1950 1 October 1950  the day that UN troops crossed the 38th parallel  was also the first anniversary of the founding of the People s Republic of China  On that day the Soviet ambassador forwarded a telegram from Stalin to Mao and Zhou requesting that China send five to six divisions into Korea  and Kim Il sung sent frantic appeals to Mao for Chinese military intervention  At the same time  Stalin made it clear that Soviet forces themselves would not directly intervene  110  In a series of emergency meetings that lasted from 2 5 October  Chinese leaders debated whether to send Chinese troops into Korea  There was considerable resistance among many leaders  including senior military leaders  to confronting the United States in Korea  Mao strongly supported intervention  and Zhou was one of the few Chinese leaders who firmly supported him  After General Lin Biao refused Mao s offer to command Chinese forces in Korea  citing poor health   Mao called General Peng Dehuai to Beijing to hear his views  After listening to both sides  arguments  Peng supported Mao s position  and the Politburo agreed to intervene in Korea  117  Later  the Chinese claimed that US bombers had violated PRC national airspace while en route to bomb North Korea before China intervened  118  On 8 October 1950  Mao Zedong redesignated the PLA North East Frontier Force as the Chinese People s Volunteer Army  PVA   119  In order to enlist Stalin s support  Zhou traveled to Stalin s summer resort on the Black Sea on 10 October  Stalin initially agreed to send military equipment and ammunition  but warned Zhou that the USSR s air force would need two or three months to prepare any operations  In a subsequent meeting  Stalin told Zhou that he would only provide China with equipment on a credit basis  and that the Soviet air force would only operate over Chinese airspace  and only after an undisclosed period of time  Stalin did not agree to send either military equipment or air support until March 1951  120  Mao did not find Soviet air support especially useful  as the fighting was going to take place on the south side of the Yalu  121  Soviet shipments of materiel  when they did arrive  were limited to small quantities of trucks  grenades  machine guns  and the like  122  Immediately on his return to Beijing on 18 October 1950  Zhou met with Mao Zedong  Peng Dehuai  and Gao Gang  and the group ordered two hundred thousand Chinese troops to enter North Korea  which they did on 25 October  After consulting with Stalin  on 13 November  Mao appointed Zhou the overall commander and coordinator of the war effort  with Peng as field commander  Orders given by Zhou were delivered in the name of the Central Military Commission  123  New Zealand artillery crew in action Soldiers from the U S  2nd Infantry Division in action near the Ch ongch on River  20 November 1950 UN aerial reconnaissance had difficulty sighting PVA units in daytime  because their march and bivouac discipline minimized aerial detection  124  The PVA marched  dark to dark   19 00 03 00   and aerial camouflage  concealing soldiers  pack animals  and equipment  was deployed by 05 30  Meanwhile  daylight advance parties scouted for the next bivouac site  During daylight activity or marching  soldiers were to remain motionless if an aircraft appeared  until it flew away  124  PVA officers were under order to shoot security violators  Such battlefield discipline allowed a three division army to march the 286 miles  460 km  from An tung  Manchuria to the combat zone in some 19 days  Another division night marched a circuitous mountain route  averaging 18 miles  29 km  daily for 18 days  30  Meanwhile  on 10 October 1950  the 89th Tank Battalion was attached to the 1st Cavalry Division  increasing the armor available for the Northern Offensive  On 15 October  after moderate KPA resistance  the 7th Cavalry Regiment and Charlie Company  70th Tank Battalion captured Namchonjam city  On 17 October  they flanked rightwards  away from the principal road  to Pyongyang   to capture Hwangju  Two days later  the 1st Cavalry Division captured Pyongyang  the North s capital city  on 19 October 1950  On 15 October 1950  President Truman and General MacArthur met at Wake Island in the mid Pacific Ocean  This meeting was much publicized because of the General s discourteous refusal to meet the President on the continental US  125  To President Truman  MacArthur speculated there was little risk of Chinese intervention in Korea  126  and that the PRC s opportunity for aiding the KPA had lapsed  He believed the PRC had some 300 000 soldiers in Manchuria  and some 100 000 125 000 soldiers at the Yalu River  He further concluded that  although half of those forces might cross south   if the Chinese tried to get down to Pyongyang  there would be the greatest slaughter  without air force protection  104  127  After secretly crossing the Yalu River on 19 October  the PVA 13th Army Group launched the First Phase Offensive on 25 October  attacking the advancing UN forces near the Sino Korean border  After decimating the ROK II Corps at the Battle of Onjong  the first confrontation between Chinese and US military occurred on 1 November 1950  deep in North Korea  thousands of soldiers from the PVA 39th Army encircled and attacked the US 8th Cavalry Regiment with three prong assaults from the north  northwest  and west and overran the defensive position flanks in the Battle of Unsan  128  The surprise assault resulted in the UN forces retreating back to the Ch ongch on River  while the Chinese unexpectedly disappeared into mountain hideouts following victory  It is unclear why the Chinese did not press the attack and follow up their victory  The UN Command  however  were unconvinced that the Chinese had openly intervened due to the sudden Chinese withdrawal  On 24 November  the Home by Christmas Offensive was launched with the US Eighth Army advancing in northwest Korea  while the US X Corps were attacking along the Korean east coast  But the Chinese were waiting in ambush with their Second Phase Offensive  On 25 November at the Korean western front  the PVA 13th Army Group attacked and over ran the ROK II Corps at the Battle of the Ch ongch on River  and then decimated the US 2nd Infantry Division on the UN forces  right flank  129  The UN Command retreated  the US Eighth Army s retreat  the longest in US Army history  130  was made possible because of the Turkish Brigade s successful  but very costly  rear guard delaying action near Kunuri that slowed the PVA attack for two days  27 9 November   On 27 November at the Korean eastern front  a US 7th Infantry Division Regimental Combat Team  3 000 soldiers  and the US 1st Marine Division  12 000 15 000 marines  were unprepared for the PVA 9th Army Group s three pronged encirclement tactics at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir  but they managed to escape under Air Force and X Corps support fire albeit with some 15 000 collective casualties  131  By 30 November  the PVA 13th Army Group managed to expel the US Eighth Army from northwest Korea  Retreating from the north faster than they had counter invaded  the Eighth Army crossed the 38th parallel border in mid December  132  The UN morale hit rock bottom when commanding General Walton Walker of the US Eighth Army was killed on 23 December 1950 in an automobile accident  133  In the northeast Korea by 11 December  the US X Corps managed to cripple 134  the PVA 9th Army Group while establishing a defensive perimeter at the port city of Hungnam  The X Corps were forced to evacuate by 24 December in order to reinforce the badly depleted US Eighth Army to the south  135  136  Map of the UN retreat in the wake of Chinese intervention During the Hungnam evacuation  about 193 shiploads of UN Command forces and materiel  approximately 105 000 soldiers  98 000 civilians  17 500 vehicles  and 350 000 tons of supplies  were evacuated to Pusan  137  The SS Meredith Victory was noted for evacuating 14 000 refugees  the largest rescue operation by a single ship  even though it was designed to hold only 12 passengers  Before escaping  the UN Command forces razed most of Hungnam city  especially the port facilities  104  138  and on 16 December 1950  President Truman declared a national emergency with Presidential Proclamation No  2914  3 C F R  99  1953   139  which remained in force until 14 September 1978  b  Fighting around the 38th parallel  January   June 1951  With Lieutenant General Matthew Ridgway assuming the command of the US Eighth Army on 26 December  the PVA and the KPA launched their Third Phase Offensive  also known as the  Chinese New Year s Offensive   on New Year s Eve of 1950  Utilizing night attacks in which UN Command fighting positions were encircled and then assaulted by numerically superior troops who had the element of surprise  The attacks were accompanied by loud trumpets and gongs  which fulfilled the double purpose of facilitating tactical communication and mentally disorienting the enemy  UN forces initially had no familiarity with this tactic  and as a result some soldiers  bugged out   abandoning their weapons and retreating to the south  140  The Chinese New Year s Offensive overwhelmed UN forces  allowing the PVA and KPA to conquer Seoul for the second time on 4 January 1951  B 26 Invaders bomb logistics depots in Wonsan  North Korea  1951 These setbacks prompted General MacArthur to consider using nuclear weapons against the Chinese or North Korean interiors  intending radioactive fallout zones would interrupt the Chinese supply chains  141  However  upon the arrival of the charismatic General Ridgway  the esprit de corps of the bloodied Eighth Army immediately began to revive  142  UN forces retreated to Suwon in the west  Wonju in the center  and the territory north of Samcheok in the east  where the battlefront stabilized and held  140  The PVA had outrun its logistics capability and thus was forced to recoil from pressing the attack beyond Seoul  143  food  ammunition  and materiel were carried nightly  on foot and bicycle  from the border at the Yalu River to the three battle lines  In late January  upon finding that the PVA had abandoned their battle lines  General Ridgway ordered a reconnaissance in force  which became Operation Roundup  5 February 1951  144   A full scale X Corps advance gradually proceeded while fully exploiting the UN Command s air superiority  145  concluded with the UN reaching the Han River and recapturing Wonju  144  In mid February  the PVA counterattacked with the Fourth Phase Offensive and achieved initial victory at Hoengseong  But the offensive was soon blunted by the IX Corps positions at Chipyong ni in the center  144  Units of the US 2nd Infantry Division and the French Battalion fought a short but desperate battle that broke the attack s momentum  144  The battle is sometimes known as the Gettysburg of the Korean War  The battle saw 5 600 Korean  American and French defeat a numerically superior Chinese force  Surrounded on all sides  the US 2nd Infantry Division Warrior Division s 23rd Regimental Combat Team with an attached French Battalion was hemmed in by more than 25 000 Chinese Communist Forces  United Nations Forces had previously retreated in the face of large Communist forces instead of getting cut off  but this time they stood and fought at odds of roughly 15 to 1  146  Marines move out over rugged mountain terrain while closing with the hostile North Korean forces  In the last two weeks of February 1951  Operation Roundup was followed by Operation Killer  carried out by the revitalized Eighth Army  It was a full scale  battlefront length attack staged for maximum exploitation of firepower to kill as many KPA and PVA troops as possible  144 Operation Killer concluded with I Corps re occupying the territory south of the Han River  and IX Corps capturing Hoengseong  147  On 7 March 1951  the Eighth Army attacked with Operation Ripper  expelling the PVA and the KPA from Seoul on 14 March 1951  This was the city s fourth conquest in a years  time  leaving it a ruin  the 1 5 million pre war population was down to 200 000  and people were suffering from severe food shortages  147  105  On 1 March 1951 Mao sent a cable to Stalin  in which he emphasized the difficulties faced by Chinese forces and the urgent need for air cover  especially over supply lines  Apparently impressed by the Chinese war effort  Stalin finally agreed to supply two air force divisions  three anti aircraft divisions  and six thousand trucks  PVA troops in Korea continued to suffer severe logistical problems throughout the war  In late April Peng Dehuai sent his deputy  Hong Xuezhi  to brief Zhou Enlai in Beijing  What Chinese soldiers feared  Hong said  was not the enemy  but that they had nothing to eat  no bullets to shoot  and no trucks to transport them to the rear when they were wounded  Zhou attempted to respond to the PVA s logistical concerns by increasing Chinese production and improving methods of supply  but these efforts were never completely sufficient  At the same time  large scale air defense training programs were carried out  and the Chinese Air Force began to participate in the war from September 1951 onward  148  Chinese soldiers surrender to Australians  24 April 1951  On 11 April 1951  Commander in Chief Truman relieved the controversial General MacArthur  the Supreme Commander in Korea  149  There were several reasons for the dismissal  MacArthur had crossed the 38th parallel in the mistaken belief that the Chinese would not enter the war  leading to major allied losses  He believed that whether or not to use nuclear weapons should be his own decision  not the President s  150  MacArthur threatened to destroy China unless it surrendered  While MacArthur felt total victory was the only honorable outcome  Truman was more pessimistic about his chances once involved in a land war in Asia  and felt a truce and orderly withdrawal from Korea could be a valid solution  151  MacArthur was the subject of congressional hearings in May and June 1951  which determined that he had defied the orders of the President and thus had violated the US Constitution  152  A popular criticism of MacArthur was that he never spent a night in Korea  and directed the war from the safety of Tokyo  153  General Ridgway was appointed Supreme Commander  Korea  he regrouped the UN forces for successful counterattacks  154  while General James Van Fleet assumed command of the US Eighth Army  155  Further attacks slowly depleted the PVA and KPA forces  Operations Courageous  23 28 March 1951  and Tomahawk  23 March 1951  were a joint ground and airborne infilltration meant to trap Chinese forces between Kaesong and Seoul  UN forces advanced to  Line Kansas   north of the 38th parallel  156  The 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team   Rakkasans   second of two combat jumps were on Easter Sunday  1951 at Munsan ni  South Korea codenamed Operation Tomahawk  The mission was to get behind Chinese forces and block their movement north  The 60th Indian Parachute Field Ambulance provided the medical cover for the operations  dropping an ADS and a surgical team and treating over 400 battle casualties apart from the civilian casualties that formed the core of their objective as the unit was on a humanitarian mission  The Chinese counterattacked in April 1951  with the Fifth Phase Offensive  also known as the  Chinese Spring Offensive   with three field armies  approximately 700 000 men   157  The offensive s first thrust fell upon I Corps  which fiercely resisted in the Battle of the Imjin River  22 25 April 1951  and the Battle of Kapyong  22 25 April 1951   blunting the impetus of the offensive  which was halted at the  No name Line  north of Seoul  158  On 15 May 1951  the Chinese commenced the second impulse of the Spring Offensive and attacked the ROK Army and the US X Corps in the east  After initial success  they were halted by 20 May  159  At month s end  the US Eighth Army counterattacked and regained  Line Kansas   just north of the 38th parallel  160  The UN s  Line Kansas  halt and subsequent offensive action stand down began the stalemate that lasted until the armistice of 1953  Stalemate  July 1951   July 1953  American flame thrower units advancing toward a tunnel entrance ROK soldiers dump spent artillery casings  For the remainder of the Korean War the UN Command and the PVA fought  but exchanged little territory  the stalemate held  Large scale bombing of North Korea continued  and protracted armistice negotiations began 10 July 1951 at Kaesong  161  On the Chinese side  Zhou Enlai directed peace talks  and Li Kenong and Qiao Guanghua headed the negotiation team  148  Combat continued while the belligerents negotiated  the UN Command forces  goal was to recapture all of South Korea and to avoid losing territory  162  The PVA and the KPA attempted similar operations  and later effected military and psychological operations in order to test the UN Command s resolve to continue the war  The principal battles of the stalemate include the Battle of Bloody Ridge  18 August   15 September 1951   163  the Battle of Heartbreak Ridge  13

Chinese troops suffered from deficient military equipment  serious logistical problems  overextended communication and supply lines  and the constant threat of UN bombers  All of these factors generally led to a rate of Chinese casualties that was far greater than the casualties suffered by UN troops  The situation became so serious that  on November 1951  Zhou Enlai called a conference in Shenyang to discuss the PVA s logistical problems  At the meeting it was decided to accelerate the construction of railways and airfields in the area  to increase the number of trucks available to the army  and to improve air defense by any means possible  These commitments did little to directly address the problems confronting PVA troops  165  In the months after the Shanyang conference Peng Dehuai went to Beijing several times to brief Mao and Zhou about the heavy casualties suffered by Chinese troops and the increasing difficulty of keeping the front lines supplied with basic necessities  Peng was convinced that the war would be protracted  and that neither side would be able to achieve victory in the foreseeable future  On 24 February 1952  the Military Commission  presided over by Zhou  discussed the PVA s logistical problems with members of various government agencies involved in the war effort  After the government representatives emphasized their inability to meet the demands of the war  Peng  in an angry outburst  shouted   You have this and that problem    You should go to the front and see with your own eyes what food and clothing the soldiers have  Not to speak of the casualties  For what are they giving their lives  We have no aircraft  We have only a few guns  Transports are not protected  More and more soldiers are dying of starvation  Can t you overcome some of your difficulties   The atmosphere became so tense that Zhou was forced to adjourn the conference  Zhou subsequently called a series of meetings  where it was agreed that the PVA would be divided into three groups  to be dispatched to Korea in shifts  to accelerate the training of Chinese pilots  to provide more anti aircraft guns to the front lines  to purchase more military equipment and ammunition from the Soviet Union  to provide the army with more food and clothing  and  to transfer the responsibility of logistics to the central government  166  Armistice  July 1953   November 1954  Men from the Royal Australian Regiment  June 1953  The on again  off again armistice negotiations continued for two years  167  first at Kaesong  southern North Korea   then relocated at Panmunjom  bordering the Koreas   168  A major  problematic negotiation point was prisoner of war  POW  repatriation  169  The PVA  KPA  and UN Command could not agree on a system of repatriation because many PVA and KPA soldiers refused to be repatriated back to the north  170  which was unacceptable to the Chinese and North Koreans  171  In the final armistice agreement  a Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was set up to handle the matter  172  In 1952 the US elected a new president  and on 29 November 1952  the president elect  Dwight D  Eisenhower  went to Korea to learn what might end the Korean War  173  With the United Nations  acceptance of India s proposed Korean War armistice  citation needed  the KPA  the PVA  and the UN Command ceased fire with the battle line approximately at the 38th parallel  Upon agreeing to the armistice  the belligerents established the Korean Demilitarized Zone  DMZ   which has since been patrolled by the KPA and ROKA  US  and Joint UN Commands  The Demilitarized Zone runs northeast of the 38th parallel  to the south  it travels west  The old Korean capital city of Kaesong  site of the armistice negotiations  originally lay in the pre war ROK  but now is in the DPRK  The United Nations Command  supported by the United States  the North Korean Korean People s Army  and the Chinese People s Volunteers  signed the Armistice Agreement on 27 July 1953 to end the fighting  The Armistice also called upon the governments of South Korea  North Korea  China and the United States to participate in continued peace talks  The war is considered to have ended at this point  even though there was no peace treaty  9  North Korea nevertheless claims that it won the Korean War  174  175  After the war  Operation Glory  July November 1954  was conducted to allow combatant countries to exchange their dead  The remains of 4 167 US Army and US Marine Corps dead were exchanged for 13 528 KPA and PVA dead  and 546 civilians dead in UN prisoner of war camps were delivered to the ROK government  176  After Operation Glory  416 Korean War unknown soldiers were buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific  The Punchbowl   on

the armistice  there have been numerous incursions and acts of aggression by North Korea  In 1976  the axe murder incident was widely publicized  Since 1974  four incursion tunnels leading to Seoul have been uncovered  In 2010  a North Korean submarine torpedoed and sank the South Korean corvette ROKS Cheonan  resulting in the deaths of 46 sailors  181  Again in 2010  North Korea fired artillery shells on Yeonpyeong island  killing two military personnel and two civilians  182  Characteristics Casualties Korean War memorials are found in every UN Command Korean War participant country  this one is in Pretoria  South Africa  According to the data from the US Department of Defense  the United States had suffered 33 686 battle deaths  along with 2 830 non battle deaths during the Korean War and 8 176 missing in action  183  Western sources estimate the PVA had suffered between 100 000 to 1 500 000 deaths  most estimate some 400 000 killed   while the KPA had suffered between 214 000 to 520 000 deaths  most estimate some 500 000   Between some 245 000 to 415 000 South Korean civilian deaths were also suggested  and the total civilian casualties during the war were estimated as 1 500 000 to 3 000 000  most sources estimate some 2 000 000 killed   184  Data from official Chinese sources  on the other hand  reported that the PVA had suffered 114 000 battle deaths  34 000 non battle deaths  340 000 wounded  7 600 missing and 21 400 captured during the war  Among those captured  about 14 000 defected to Taiwan while the other 7 110 were repatriated to China  185  Chinese sources also reported that North Korea had suffered 290 000 casualties  90 000 captured and a  large  number of civilian deaths  185  In return  the Chinese and North Koreans estimated that about 390 000 soldiers from United States  660 000 soldiers from South Korea and 29 000 other UN soldiers were  eliminated  from the battlefield  185  Armored warfare Supporting the 8th ROK Army Division  a Sherman tank fires its 76 mm gun at KPA bunkers at  Napalm Ridge   Korea  11 May 1952 Initially  North Korean armor dominated the battlefield with Soviet T 34 85 medium tanks designed during the Second World War  186  The KPA s tanks confronted a tankless ROK Army armed with few modern anti tank weapons  187  including American World War II model 2 36 inch  60 mm  M9 bazookas  effective only against the 45 mm side armor of the T 34 85 tank  188  The US forces arriving in Korea were equipped with light M24 Chaffee tanks  on occupation duty in nearby Japan  that also proved ineffective against the heavier KPA T 34 tanks  189  During the initial hours of warfare  some under equipped ROK Army border units used American 105 mm howitzers as anti tank guns to stop the tanks heading the KPA columns  firing high explosive anti tank ammunition  HEAT  over open sights to good effect  at the war s start  the ROK Army had 91 howitzers  but lost most to the invaders  190  Countering the initial combat imbalance  the UN Command reinforcement materiel included heavier US M4 Sherman  M26 Pershing  M46 Patton  and British Cromwell and Centurion tanks that proved effective against North Korean armor  ending its battlefield dominance  191  Unlike in the Second World War  1939 45   in which the tank proved a decisive weapon  the Korean War featured few large scale tank battles  The mountainous  heavily forested terrain prevented large masses of tanks from maneuvering  In Korea  tanks served largely as infantry support and mobile artillery pieces  Aerial warfare Further information  MiG Alley  USAF Units and Aircraft of the Korean War  and Korean People s Air Force MiG Alley  A MiG 15 shot down by an F 86 Sabre The KPAF shot down some 16 B 29 Superfortress bombers in the war  A US Navy Sikorsky HO4S flying near the USS Sicily The Korean War was the first war in which jet aircraft played a central role  Once formidable fighters such as the P 51 Mustang  F4U Corsair  and Hawker Sea Fury 192  all piston engined  propeller driven  and designed during World War II relinquished their air superiority roles to a new generation of faster  jet powered fighters arriving in the theater  For the initial months of the war  the P 80 Shooting Star  F9F Panther  and other jets under the UN flag dominated North Korea s prop driven air force of Soviet Yakovlev Yak 9 and Lavochkin La 9s  The balance would shift with the arrival of the swept wing Soviet MiG 15 Fagot  193  194  The Chinese intervention in late October 1950 bolstered the Korean People s Air Force  KPAF  of North Korea with the MiG 15 Fagot  one of the world s most advanced jet fighters  193  The fast  heavily armed MiG outflew first generation UN jets such as the American F 80 and Australian and British Gloster Meteors  posing a real threat to B 29 Superfortress bombers even under fighter escort  Soviet Air Force pilots flew missions for the North to learn the West s aerial combat techniques  This direct Soviet participation is a casus belli that the UN Command deliberately overlooked  lest the war for the Korean peninsula expand  as the US initially feared  to include three communist countries North Korea  the Soviet Union  and China and so escalate to atomic warfare  193  The USAF moved quickly to counter the MiG 15  with three squadrons of its most capable fighter  the F 86 Sabre  arriving in December 1950  195  196  Although the MiG s higher service ceiling 50 000 feet  15 000 m  vs  42 000 feet  13 000 m  could be advantageous at the start of a dogfight  in level flight  both swept wing designs attained comparable maximum speeds of around 660 mph  1 100 km h   The MiG climbed faster  but the Sabre turned and dived better  197  The MiG was armed with one 37 mm and two 23 mm cannons  while the Sabre carried six  50 caliber  12 7 mm  machine guns aimed with radar ranged gunsights  By early 1951  the battle lines were established and changed little until 1953  In summer and autumn 1951  the outnumbered Sabres of the USAF s 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing only 44 at one point continued seeking battle in MiG Alley  where the Yalu River marks the Chinese border  against Chinese and North Korean air forces capable of deploying some 500 aircraft  Following Colonel Harrison Thyng s communication with the Pentagon  the 51st Fighter Interceptor Wing finally reinforced the beleaguered 4th Wing in December 1951  for the next year and a half stretch of the war  aerial warfare continued  198  UN forces gained air superiority in the Korean theater after the initial months of the war and maintained it for the duration  This was decisive for the UN  first  for attacking into the peninsular north  and second  for resisting the Chinese intervention  191  North Korea and China also had jet powered air forces  their limited training and experience made it strategically untenable to lose them against the better trained UN air forces  Thus  the US and USSR fed materiel to the war  battling by proxy and finding themselves virtually matched  technologically  when the USAF deployed the F 86F against the MiG 15 late in 1952  Unlike the Vietnam War  in which the USSR only officially sent  advisers   in the Korean aerial war soviet forces participated via the 64th Airborn Corps  1106 enemy airplanes were officially downed by the soviet pilots  52 of whom earned the title of  aces    more than 5 confirmed kills  Since the soviet system of confirming air kills erred on the conservative side   the pilot s words were never taken into account without corroboration from other witnesses  and enemy airplanes falling into the sea were not counted  perhaps the number is greater than 1106  199  After the war  and to the present day  the USAF reports an F 86 Sabre kill ratio in excess of 10 1  with 792 MiG 15s and 108 other aircraft shot down by Sabres  and 78 Sabres lost to enemy fire  200  The Soviet Air Force reported some 1 100 air to air victories and 335 MiG combat losses  while China s People s Liberation Army Air Force  PLAAF  reported 231 combat losses  mostly MiG 15s  and 168 other aircraft lost  The KPAF reported no data  but the UN Command estimates some 200 KPAF aircraft lost in the war s first stage  and 70 additional aircraft after the Chinese intervention  The USAF disputes Soviet and Chinese claims of 650 and 211 downed F 86s  respectively  However  one unconfirmed source claims that the US Air Force has more recently cited 230 losses out of 674 F 86s deployed to Korea  197  The differing tactical roles of the F 86 and MiG 15 may have contributed to the disparity in losses  MiG 15s primarily targeted B 29 bombers and ground attack fighter bombers  while F 86s targeted the MiGs  The Korean War marked a major milestone not only for fixed wing aircraft  but also for rotorcraft  featuring the first large scale deployment of helicopters for medical evacuation  medevac   201  In 1944 1945  during the Second World War  the YR 4 helicopter saw limited ambulance duty  but in Korea  where rough terrain trumped the jeep as a speedy medevac vehicle  202  helicopters like the Sikorsky H 19 helped reduce fatal casualties to a dramatic degree when combined with complementary medical innovations such as Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals  203  The limitations of jet aircraft for close air support highlighted the helicopter s potential in the role  leading to development of the AH 1 Cobra and other helicopter gunships used in the Vietnam War  1965 75   201  Bombing North Korea On 12 August 1950 the USAF dropped 625 tons of bombs on North Korea  two weeks later  the daily tonnage increased to some 800 tons  204  U S  warplanes dropped more napalm and bombs on North Korea than they did during the whole Pacific campaign of World War II  205  As a result  eighteen of North Korea s cities were more than 50  destroyed  The war s highest ranking American POW  US Major General William F  Dean  206  reported that most of the North Korean cities and villages he saw were either ruins or snow covered wastelands  207  As well as conventional bombing  the Communist side claimed that the US had used biological weapons  208

October 1950 Because neither Korea had a large navy  the Korean War featured few naval battles  mostly the combatant navies served as naval artillery for their in country armies  A skirmish between North Korea and the UN Command occurred on 2 July 1950  the US Navy cruiser USS Juneau  the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Jamaica  and the frigate HMS Black Swan fought four North Korean torpedo boats and two mortar gunboats  and sank them  During most of the war  the UN navies patrolled the west and east coasts of North Korea and sank supply and ammunition ships to deny the sea to North Korea  Aside from very occasional gunfire from North Korean shore batteries  the main threat to US and UN navy ships was from magnetic mines the North Koreans employed for defensive purposes  The USS Juneau sank ammunition ships that had been present in her previous battle  The last sea battle of the Korean War occurred at Inchon  days before the Battle of Incheon  the ROK ship PC 703 sank a North Korean mine layer in the Battle of Haeju Island  near Inchon  Three other supply ships were sunk by PC 703 two days later in the Yellow Sea  209  U S  threat of atomic warfare On 5 April 1950  the Joint Chiefs of Staff  JCS  issued orders for the retaliatory atomic bombing of Manchurian PRC military bases  if either their armies crossed into Korea or if PRC or KPA bombers attacked Korea from there  The President ordered the transfer of nine Mark 4 nuclear bombs  to the Air Force s Ninth Bomb Group  the designated carrier of the weapons      and  signed an order to use them against Chinese and Korean targets   which he never transmitted  210  President Truman did not immediately threaten nuclear warfare after the October 1950 Chinese intervention  but  45 days later  remarked about the possibility of using it after the PVA repelled the UN Command from North Korea  In The Origins of the Korean War  1981  1990   US historian Bruce Cumings reports that in a 30 November 1950 press conference  President Truman s allusions to attacking the KPA with nuclear weapons  was a threat based on contingency planning to use the bomb  rather than the faux pas so many assumed it to be   On 30 November 1950  the USAF Strategic Air Command was ordered to  augment its capacities  and that this should include atomic capabilities   citation needed  The Indian Ambassador  K  Madhava Panikkar  reports  that Truman announced that he was thinking of using the atom bomb in Korea  But the Chinese seemed totally unmoved by this threat     The propaganda against American aggression was stepped up  The  Aid Korea to resist America  campaign was made the slogan for increased production  greater national integration  and more rigid control over anti national activities  One could not help feeling that Truman s threat came in very useful to the leaders of the Revolution  to enable them to keep up the tempo of their activities   104  211  212  Atom bomb test  1951  This was the Operation Buster Jangle Dog shot  on 1 November  President Truman remarked that his government was actively considering using atomic weapons to end the war in Korea but that only he the US President commanded atomic bomb use  and that he had not given authorization  The matter of atomic warfare was solely a US decision  not the collective decision of the UN  Truman met on 4 December 1950 with UK prime minister and Commonwealth spokesman Clement Attlee  French Premier Ren  Pleven  and Foreign Minister Robert Schuman to discuss their worries about atomic warfare and its likely continental expansion  The US s forgoing atomic warfare was not because of  a disinclination by the USSR and PRC to escalate  the Korean War  but because UN allies notably from the UK  the Commonwealth  and France were concerned about a geopolitical imbalance rendering NATO defenseless while the US fought China  who then might persuade the USSR to conquer Western Europe  104  213  On 6 December 1950  after the Chinese intervention repelled the UN Command armies from northern North Korea  General J  Lawton Collins  Army Chief of Staff   General MacArthur  Admiral C  Turner Joy  General George E  Stratemeyer  and staff officers Major General Doyle Hickey  Major General Charles A  Willoughby  and Major General Edwin K  Wright  met in Tokyo to plan strategy countering the Chinese intervention  they considered three potential atomic warfare scenarios encompassinging the next weeks and months of warfare  104  In the first scenario  If the PVA continued attacking in full and the UN Command is forbidden to blockade and bomb China  and without Nationalist Chinese reinforcements  and without an increase in US forces until April 1951  four National Guard divisions were due to arrive   then atomic bombs might be used in North Korea  104  In the second scenario  If the PVA continued full attacks and the UN Command have blockaded China and have effective aerial reconnaissance and bombing of the Chinese interior  and the Nationalist Chinese soldiers are maximally exploited  and tactical atomic bombing is to hand  then the UN forces could hold positions deep in North Korea  104  In the third scenario  if the PRC agreed to not cross the 38th parallel border  General MacArthur recommended UN acceptance of an armistice disallowing PVA and KPA troops south of the parallel  and requiring PVA and KPA guerrillas to withdraw northwards  The US Eighth Army would remain to protect the Seoul Incheon area  while X Corps would retreat to Pusan  A UN commission should supervise implementation of the armistice  104  In 1951  the US escalated closest to atomic warfare in Korea  Because the PRC had deployed new armies to the Sino Korean frontier  pit crews at the Kadena Air Base  Okinawa  assembled atomic bombs for Korean warfare   lacking only the essential pit nuclear cores   In October 1951  the US effected Operation Hudson Harbor to establish nuclear weapons capability  USAF B 29 bombers practised individual bombing runs from Okinawa to North Korea  using dummy nuclear or conventional bombs   coordinated from Yokota Air Base in east central Japan  Hudson Harbor tested  actual functioning of all activities which would be involved in an atomic strike  including weapons assembly and testing  leading  ground control of bomb aiming   The bombing run data indicated that atomic bombs would be tactically ineffective against massed infantry  because the  timely identification of large masses of enemy troops was extremely rare   214  215  216  217  218  War crimes  MEMO  25 Jul

this period were suffering mass starvation and diseases due to the lack of competent logistics system  The UN POWs  however  disputed the claim by pointing out that most of the Chinese camps were located near the easily supplied Sino Korean border  and that starvation was used to force the prisoners to accept the communism indoctrination programs  which were running in full swing after the starvation was over  234  National Defense Corps soldiers in January  1951  The North Korean Government reported some 70 000 ROK Army POWs  8 000 were repatriated  South Korea repatriated 76 000

Zedong s decision to involve China in the Korean War was a conscientious effort to confront the most powerful country in the world  undertaken at a time when the regime was still consolidating its own power after winning the Chinese Civil War  Mao primarily supported intervention not to save North Korea or to appease the Soviet Union  but because he believed that a military conflict with the United States was inevitable after UN forces crossed the 38th parallel  Mao s secondary motive was to improve his own prestige inside the communist international community by demonstrating that his Marxist concerns were international  In his later years Mao believed that Stalin only gained a positive opinion of him after China s entrance into the Korean War  Inside China  the war improved the long term prestige of Mao  Zhou  and Peng  246  China emerged from the Korean War united by a sense of national pride  despite the war s enormous costs  The Chinese people were educated to believe that the war was initiated by the United States and Korea  and not by a fraternal communist state in the north  In Chinese propaganda  the Chinese war effort was portrayed and accepted as an example of China s engaging the strongest power in the world with an under equipped army  forcing it to retreat  and fighting it to a military stalemate  These successes were contrasted with China s historical humiliations by Japan and by Western powers over the previous hundred years in order to promote the image of the PLA and the CCP  The most significant negative long term consequence of the war  for China  was that it led the United States to guarantee the safety of Chiang Kai shek s regime in Taiwan  effectively ensuring that Taiwan would remain outside of PRC control until the present day  246  The Korean War affected other participant combatants  Turkey  for example  entered NATO in 1952 247  and the foundation for bilateral diplomatic and trade relations was laid  248  The beginning of racial integration efforts in the U S  military began during the Korean War  where African Americans fought in integrated units for the first time  Among the 1 8 million American soldiers who fought in the Korean War there were more than 100 000 African Americans  249  Post war recovery was different in the two Koreas  South Korea stagnated in the first post war decade  but later industrialized and modernized  Contemporary North Korea remains underdeveloped  South Korea had one of the world s fastest growing economies from the early 1960s to the late 1990s  In 1957 South Korea had a lower per capita GDP than Ghana  250  and by 2010 it was ranked thirteenth in the world  Ghana was 86th   251  Korean anti Americanism after the war was fueled by the presence and behavior of American military personnel  USFK  and U S  support for authoritarian regime  a fact still evident during the country s democratic transition in the 1980s  252  In a February 2002 Gallup Korea poll  only one third of South Koreans viewed the United States favorably  253  In addition a large number of mixed race  G I  babies   offspring of U S  and other western soldiers and Korean women  were filling up the country s orphanages  Korean traditional society places significant weight on paternal family ties  bloodlines  and purity of race  Children of mixed race or those without fathers are not easily accepted in Korean society  Thousands were adopted by American families in the years following the war  when their plight was covered on television  254  The U S  Immigration Act of 1952 removed race as a limiting factor in immigration  and made possible the entry of military spouses and children from South Korea after the Korean War  With the passage of the Immigration Act of 1965  which substantially changed U S  immigration policy toward non Europeans  Koreans became one of the fastest growing Asian groups in the United States  255  In 2011  some former member of Chinese People s Volunteer Army  who had battled there  revisited North Korea  After the revisit  they said that they were  very sad   unsatified with the post war developement of North Korea    We  liberated them  but they re still struggling for freedom   said Qu Yingkui  256  See also List of books about the Korean War Joint Advisory Commission  Korea Korean DMZ Conflict  1966 1969  Korean reunification
