above London in Spring 1910  2  The action descends to Earth where Bert  Dick Van Dyke   a Cockney jack of all trades is performing as a one man band at a park entrance  The spectators watching him include  Ms  Persimmon  Marjorie Eaton   Miss Lark  Marjorie Bennett  and Mrs  Corry  Alma Lawton   He suddenly senses that his good friend is about to return  After the show  he speaks directly to the audience  introducing viewers first to Admiral Bloom  who keeps his exterior rooftop  Ship Shape   by firing his cannon at 8 AM and 6 PM each day  and then to the well to do but troubled Banks family  headed by the cold and aloof George Banks  David Tomlinson  and the loving but highly distracted suffragette Winifred Banks  Glynis Johns   The Bankses  latest nanny  Katie Nanna  Elsa Lanchester   is quitting out of exasperation after the Banks children  Jane  Karen Dotrice  and Michael  Matthew Garber   have run off for the fourth time this week  Ellen  the maid  Hermione Baddeley   pleads with her not to leave  but Mrs  Brill  the cook  Reta Shaw   wishes her good riddance  Mrs  Banks returns home  and engages all four women in a rousing rendition of  Sister Suffragette   before Katie Nanna stalks out  Mr  Banks returns home from his job at the Dawes Tomes Mousley Grubbs Fidelity Fiduciary Bank  and Mrs  Banks reveals the children are missing  A policeman  Arthur Treacher   arrives with the children  who ask their father to help repair their damaged kite  but he dismisses them and advertises for an authoritarian nanny replacement  Jane and Michael draft their own advertisement asking for a fun  kind hearted and caring person  but Mr  Banks tears up the paper and throws it in the fireplace  Unnoticed  the remains of the note float up the dark chimney  The next day  a queue of elderly and disagreeable looking candidates await at the door  However a strong gust of wind blows the queue away and Mary Poppins floats down  held aloft by her magical umbrella  to apply  Mr  Banks is stunned to see that this calmly defiant new nanny has responded to the children s ad despite the fact he destroyed it  Although Mary Poppins recites the ad  she also tells George that she is firm and will also lay down ground rules with the children  As he puzzles  Mary Poppins employs herself and begins work  saying that she will stay for a trial period of one week  before deciding if she will take a permanent position  The children face surprises of their own  Mary possesses a bottomless carpetbag  and makes contents of the children s nursery come to life and tidy themselves  by snapping her fingers   The trio then meet Bert  who is a close friend of Mary  in the park at work as a screever  where Mary uses one of his chalk pavement drawings as a gateway to an outing in an animated countryside  While in the drawing  the children ride a merry go round while Mary and Bert enjoy a stroll through the countryside  during which Bert dances at an outdoor bistro with four penguin waiters  Mary and Bert join the children on the merry go round  from which the horses break loose and take their riders on a trip through the countryside  As they pass by a fox hunt  Bert manoeuvres to save an Irish accented fox from the bloodhounds  Finally the quartet finds themselves in a horse race  which Mary wins  It is here that Mary first employs the nonsense word  Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious   The outing is interrupted by a rainstorm  which washes away the chalk drawing and returns the travellers to the park pavement  That evening  the children ask Mary how long she ll stay with them  With a sombre expression  she replies   I shall stay until the wind changes   The next day  they all visit Bert s jovial Uncle Albert  Ed Wynn   who floats whenever he laughs  and join him in a tea party in mid air  though Mary finds it childish and ridiculous  They all get down  only when one had to think of  Something Sad   when Mary firmly says   It is time to go home   Mr  Banks grows increasingly irate with his children s stories of their adventures  but Mary effortlessly inverts his attempted dismissal of her services into a plan to take his children with him to the Dawes Tomes Mousley Grubbs Fidelity Fiduciary Bank  where he is employed  On the way there  as they pass the bank  the children see  The Bird Woman  Jane Darwell    of whom Mary sang to them the night before  and they want to feed the birds around her  but George will have none of it as he expresses his disinterest in what Mary Poppins says and orders his children to  come along  and not mention her name for the rest of the day  Upon arriving at the bank  Mr  Dawes Jr  Arthur Malet  and Mr  Dawes Sr  Dick Van Dyke  Mr  Banks  employers aggressively try to persuade Michael to invest his tuppence in the bank to the point of actually snatching it out of his hand without waiting for his permission  When Michael protests  the other customers misunderstand and start a run on the bank that forces the bank to suspend business  The Bank Guard  Jimmy Logan  chases the children causing the children to flee and wander into the slums of the East End of London  Fortunately  they run into Bert  now employed as a chimney sweep  He takes them safely home  explaining that their father does not hate them  but that he has problems of his own  and that unlike the children  has no one to whom to turn but himself  At home  a departing Mrs  Banks employs Bert to clean the family s chimney and mind the children  Mary Poppins arrives back from her day off and warns of the dangers of this activity  but is too late as the children are both sucked up the chimney to the roof  Bert and Mary follow them and lead a tour of the rooftops of London that concludes with a joyful dance with Bert s chimney sweep colleagues  A volley of fireworks from the Banks  eccentric neighbour  Admiral Boom  Reginald Owen   who mistakes them for Hottentots  orders Mr  Binnacle  Don Barclay  to set off the fireworks which sends the entire gathering back down a different chimney  which turns out to be the Banks  chimney  Mr  Banks arrives home  causing the chimney sweepers to depart outside the home  and out into the street  where they disappear from view within less than half a minute  Their departure conclude the festivities  Banks angrily inquires Mary Poppins what was the meaning of this  in which Mary replies that she never explains anything  Banks then receives a phone call from work ordering him to return immediately for disciplinary action  As Mr  Banks gathers his strength  Bert points out that while Mr  Banks does need to make a living  his offspring s childhood will come and go in a blink of an eye  and he needs to be there for them while he can  The Banks children approach their father to apologize  and Michael gives Mr  Banks his tuppence in the hope that it will make things all right  Banks gently accepts the offering  A somber and thoughtful Mr  Banks walks alone through the night time streets  for the first time noticing several of the buildings around him  including the cathedral and steps on which the bird woman was sitting earlier  At the bank  he is formally humiliated and sacked for causing the first run on the bank since 1773  it is stated that the bank supplied the money for the shipment of tea destroyed in the Boston Tea Party   However  after being at a loss when ordered to give a statement  Mr  Banks invokes Mary Poppins  all purpose word  Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious   to tweak Mr  Dawes  He gives Dawes the tuppence  tells the old man one of Bert s and Uncle Albert s jokes  and raucously departs  Dawes mulls over the joke  finally  gets it  and floats up into the air  laughing  The next morning  the wind has changed direction  and so Mary must depart  Meanwhile  the Banks adults cannot find Mr  Banks  and fear that he might have become suicidal  However  Mr  Banks  now loving and joyful  reappears with the now mended kite and cheerfully summons his children  The greatly relieved Mrs  Banks supplies a tail for the kite  using one of her suffragette ribbons  They all leave the house without a backward glance as Mary Poppins watches from a window  In the park with other kite flyers  Mr  Banks meets Mr  Dawes Jr   now in charge of the bank  who says that his father literally died laughing  Instead of being upset  the son is delighted his father died happy and re employs Mr  Banks to fill the opening as junior partner  Her work done  Mary Poppins takes to the air with a fond farewell from Bert  who was selling kites   telling her not to stay away too long   edit  Production history The first book was the main basis for the Walt Disney film Mary Poppins  a musical with mixed live action and animation which premiered on August 27  1964  well into the first year of the British Invasion  It was the Sherman Brothers  who composed the music and song score  and who were also involved in the picture s development  who suggested that the setting be changed from the 1930s to the Edwardian era  Julie Andrews  who was making her movie acting debut after a successful stage career  got the prime role of Mary Poppins soon after she was passed over by Jack Warner and replaced with Audrey Hepburn for the role of Eliza Doolittle in his screen version of My Fair Lady  even though Andrews had originated the role on Broadway  3  Andrews later beat Hepburn for the Best Actress Awards in both the Golden Globes and Academy Awards for their respective roles  Disney cast Dick Van Dyke in the key supporting role of Bert  thanks to his work on The Dick Van Dyke Show  Van Dyke also played the senior Mr  Dawes in the film  Although he is fondly remembered for this film  Van Dyke s attempt at a cockney accent is regarded as one of the worst film accents in history  cited as an example by actors since as something that they wish to avoid  In a 2003 poll by Empire magazine of the worst film accents of all time he came second  4  5  Van Dyke claims that his accent coach was Irish  who  didn t do an accent any better than I did   6  According to the 40th Anniversary DVD release of the film in 2004  Walt Disney first attempted to purchase the film rights to Mary Poppins from P  L  Travers as early as 1938 but was rebuffed because Travers did not believe a film version of her books would do justice to her creation  In addition  Disney was known at the time primarily as a producer of cartoons and had yet to produce any major live action work  For more than 20 years  Disney periodically made efforts to convince Travers to allow him to make a Poppins film  He finally succeeded in 1961  although Travers demanded and got script approval rights  Planning the film and composing the songs took about two years  Travers objected to a number of elements that actually made it into the film  Rather than original songs  she wanted the soundtrack to feature known standards of the Edwardian period in which the story is set  She also objected to the animated sequence  Disney overruled her  citing contract stipulations that he had final say on the finished print  In the end  Travers was probably at least somewhat justified in her doubts  While retaining much of the flavor of the first book  the film changed the story line in a number of places  For example  Mary  approaching the house  controlled the wind rather than other way around  Also  the father  rather than the mother  interviewed Mary for the nanny position  And so forth  Much of the Travers   Disney correspondence is part of the Travers collection of papers in the Mitchell Library of New South Wales  Australia  The relationship between Travers and Disney is detailed in Mary Poppins She Wrote  a biography of Travers  by Valerie Lawson  The biography is the basis for two documentaries on Travers  The Real Mary Poppins and Lisa Matthews  The Shadow of Mary Poppins  7  8  9  A number of other changes were necessary to condense the story into feature length  In the movie  there are only two Banks children  Jane and Michael  The satirical and mysterious aspects of the original book gave way to a cheerful and  Disneyfied  tone  Mary Poppins  character as portrayed by Andrews in the film is somewhat less vain and more sympathetic towards the children than the rather cold and intimidating nanny of the original book  Bert  as played by Van Dyke  was a composite of several characters from Travers  stories  Travers demanded that any suggestions of romance between Mary and Bert be eliminated  so lyrics were written for  Jolly Holiday  that clearly indicated that their friendship was purely platonic   Some subtle hints of romance  however  did remain in the finished film   As mentioned above  Van Dyke played two roles in the film  Andrews did at least three  during  A Spoonful of Sugar   she provided the whistling harmony for the robin  which actually employed a model of a male American robin  nesting with another adult male American Robin   and she was also one of the Pearly singers during  Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious   David Tomlinson  besides playing Mr  Banks  also provided the voice of Mary s talking umbrella as well as numerous other voice over parts  including that of Admiral Boom s first mate   During the Jolly Holiday sequence  the three singing Cockney geese were all voiced by Marni Nixon  a regular aural substitute for actresses with poor singing voices  Nixon would later play one of Julie Andrews  fellow nuns in The Sound of Music  she had also provided the singing voice for Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady   edit  Cast and characters Audio animatronic versions of Mary Poppins and Bert in The Great Movie Ride   edit  Mary Poppins Main article  Mary Poppins  character   Practically perfect in every way   Mary Poppins  Julie Andrews  winner of the Best Actress Oscar Award  comes down from the clouds in response to the Banks children s advertisement for a Nanny  She is not only firm in her use of authority  but kind and gentle as well  a major departure from the original books  in which the character was strict and pompous   She travels to help children everywhere when they are most in need   edit  Bert Bert  Dick Van Dyke  is a Cockney  as well as being a jack of all trades  and Mary s closest normal friend who is notable in that he is completely accustomed to her magic  Their interaction  such as in the song  Jolly Holiday   makes it clear they have known each other for a long time  and that this kind of story has repeated itself many times  When she sails away at the end of the film  he asks her not to stay away too long  this time  possibly showing that he is accustomed to having Mary come and go as she pleases  Bert has at least four jobs throughout the film  a one man band  a pavement chalk artist  or  screever    a chimney sweep  and a kite seller  Bert also hints at selling hot chestnuts  His various street vending jobs meet with mixed financial success  but he retains his cheery disposition and a bright red nose  Bert also indirectly assists Mary Poppins in her mission to save the Banks family  as he plays a key role in helping the Banks children and Mr  Banks to understand each other better   edit  Mr  Banks George Banks  David Tomlinson  is Mary Poppins  employer  He works at the Dawes Tomes Mousley Grubbs Fidelity Fiduciary Bank in the City of London  and lives at 17 Cherry Tree Lane with his wife  Winifred  and their children  He is a driven and disciplined man  he could be considered a Type A personality in modern standards  who callously dismisses the  Votes for Women  movement and tends to treat his children  wife  and servants as assets rather than people   a fact clearly evidenced in his song  The Life I Lead   By the end of the movie  Mr  Banks  attitude towards his family  job  and Mary Poppins has changed dramatically  In contrast to what his children want  George wants a strict and authoritarian nanny that will give commands to  mold  Jane and Michael into nothing more than little obedient soldiers  something that his wife agrees with until and after the children show their ad for a new nanny  Melodies in the score punctuate the children s need for their father s attention and love  and most of the dramatic tension in the film involves his journey from disconnected family autocrat to fully engaged family man  According to the Special Edition Soundtrack bonus disc  Mary Poppins was George s own nanny when he was a child  Travers intended to have the script hint this strongly in a few places  but it was largely left out of the movie  except for the following words in Bert s opening song   Can t put me finger on what lies in store     But I feel what s to  appen  all  appened before       and George s own statement to the elder Mr  Dawes identifying  Poppins  as  my nanny   However  in Banks  initial interview with Mary Poppins  there is little or no indication that the two have ever met before  and his description of her as  my nanny  could easily be meant in the same way as  the nanny I have employed to look after my children during the day  or even  my maid  or  my cook    edit  Mrs  Banks Winifred Banks  Glynis Johns  is the wife of George Banks and the mother of Jane and Michael  She is more fully developed in the film than in the books  She is depicted as a member of Emmeline Pankhurst s suffragette movement and appears to be so dedicated to the women s cause to the extent that she  like her husband  neglects the children  Her main outfit is a blue and orange Edwardian style dress with a white and blue sash that reads  Votes for Women  in black letters  She wears white gloves in the film  as did most Edwardian English women  and a stylish hat  Her song in the film is  Sister Suffragette   which she sings with the other two women of the household staff  She is mostly responsible for the primary duty which is  Posts  everyone    a simple way to protect elegant and delicate household items  such as vases or pictures  from destruction when Mr  Binnicle fires the cannon on top of Admiral Boom s house next door  She is also given yellow daisies by her son Michael one morning as he and his sister are singing  Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious   She is more sensitive to the needs of the children than her husband is  but also finds herself starved for his attention  As with the children  it is clear she loves George very much  but he is too wrapped up in his view of the way things  ought to be  to return her love satisfactorily  Mrs  Banks was originally named  Cynthia   but this was quickly changed to the more  English sounding  Winifred after some issues with the script  Mrs  Banks  four  Votes for Women  sashes from the film have all survived and are in perfect condition  One can be seen being  pulled out  of Richard M  Sherman s  special musicians  trunk  on the Musical Journey seen on the 2004 DVD release  Mrs  Banks and Mary Poppins never speak to each other in the movie  possibly to show that the  man  of the household had power  and would deal with the nanny   though Mrs  Banks does mention her frequently  In the book  they do speak to one another   edit  The Banks children While the Banks family in the original novel had four children  only Jane  Karen Dotrice  and Michael  Matthew Garber  appear in the film  the reason for this is that the other two children were infants who contributed almost nothing to the plot   Katie Nanna s stormy departure suggests that the children are impossibly undisciplined  and they do demonstrate some evidence of this in their own advertisement for a new nanny  as they promise not to  hide her spectacles so she can t see  put toads in her bed or pepper in her tea  while smiling at each other in remembrance of jokes on former nannies  Once Mary Poppins arrives  the children come across as mostly sweet and innocent  albeit a tad rebellious  All they want is for their father to love them  and they have mistakenly interpreted his indifference to their needs as disliking them  They have tried to live up to his demands on them  which has only left them with shaky self esteem  Those elements come together in a bit of dialogue early in the film  in which they explain that they did not run away from Katie Nanna  their kite took them away from her  They say that the kite is not very good   because they made it themselves   They suggest to their father that if he could help them with it  it would turn out better  Alas  at that point  Banks is too wrapped up in his philosophy  that a British household should be run like a British bank  to take this strongest of hints  After inadvertently causing a run on the bank  the children give their father their tuppence  expressing the hope that it will make things right  At that moment  Mr  Banks finally understands  and his priorities take a 180 degree turn  leading to the film s happy resolution   edit  Minor characters Ellen  Hermione Baddeley   the maid of the Banks residence  Although she is fond of the children she hates having to look after them  when there is no nanny available in the household  Mrs  Brill  Reta Shaw   the cook of the Banks residence  She doesn t like intruders when she sees them  For example  in the musical number called  Step In Time   she sees too many chimney sweepers and screams the phrase   THEY RE AT IT AGAIN   Admiral Boom  Reginald Owen   the Banks s neighbour and a naval officer  He has his first mate  Mr  Binnacle  fire a cannon from his roof every 8 a m  and 6 p m  When those firings are about to happen  the attendants of the Banks shout  Posts  everyone   and rush to keep fragile possessions from falling to the ground while the house rocks  The admiral is known for his punctuality  He also considers a group of mean nannies as  ghastly looking crew   Mr  Binnacle  Don Barclay   Admiral Boom s first mate  He gets excited when he is ordered to give the cannon a double charge  Constable Jones  Arthur Treacher   a police officer who convinces Mr  Banks that the kite pulled the Banks children away when he brought them back  He is a kindhearted man that knows his duties  but hates the way George treats his family and servants  as he mutters to himself before walking out the Banks  home in his first scene  Katie Nanna  Elsa Lanchester   the disgruntled nanny who quits the Banks family  Mrs  Brill never liked her one bit  although Ellen begged her not to leave because then Ellen would have to watch over the children alone  Miss  Lark  Marjorie Bennett   The Banks  neighbour  A prissy  prim and posh old woman with a dog named Andrew  who frequently runs away  Mr  Dawes Sr   Dick Van Dyke   the impossibly ancient director of the bank where Mr  Banks works  he often needs a little help when he moves clumsily and literally dies laughing toward the end of the film after Mr  Banks tells him a joke   During the film s end titles   Navckid Keyd  is credited as Mr  Dawes Sr  an anagram of  Dick Van Dyke    Mr  Dawes Jr   Arthur Malet   the director s son and member of the board  Surprisingly  he does not mourn his father passing  as he is glad that he died happily  Uncle Albert  Ed Wynn   a jolly  portly gentleman who loves to laugh uncontrollably and floats up every time he does so  it also happens to other characters in the movie  The bird woman  Jane Darwell  in her final film appearance   Mrs  Corry  Alma Lawton   an old Shopkeeper of a gingerbread shop  she has two daughters who were once shorter than her  but they grew  and are now twice her height  Mary Poppins and the children nearly visit her shop but have to change plans so they can see Uncle Albert  She is apparently the oldest person in the world  The parrot handle to Mary s umbrella  David Tomlinson  uncredited  who speaks at the end of the film  Miss Persimmon at the park  Marjorie Eaton  After a pause when the wind blew and her only word was  Yes  questioningly  In the book she is a nurse looking after Uncle Albert  The Bank doorman  Jimmy Logan   who chases after the children in the bank run   edit  Songs Overture   Orchestral medley of several of the songs from the film  including  Feed the Birds    A Spoonful of Sugar    Chim Chim Cher ee  and  Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious    Jolly Holiday    A few bars of the song  played by Dick Van Dyke with his  one man band  gear   Sister Suffragette    Glynis Johns  Hermione Baddeley and Reta Shaw  with non singing interruptions by Elsa Lanchester  Initially heard in an a cappella rendition by Johns  just prior to singing the full  orchestra accompanied song with the house staff  and a later instrumental version in the  Step in Time  sequence  where Mrs  Banks is flanked by chimney sweeps who act as an honor guard of sorts   The Life I Lead    David Tomlinson  later reprised with Julie Andrews as  A British Bank  and with Dick Van Dyke as  A Man has Dreams     The Perfect Nanny    Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber  A Spoonful of Sugar    Julie Andrews  the 2004 DVD release reveals that Andrews also performed the bird s whistling during this number

Dick Van Dyke  also performed by Van Dyke with Julie Andrews  Karen Dotrice  and Matthew Garber  won the Academy Award for Best Original Song   Step in Time    Dick Van Dyke and other Chimney Sweepers  A Man Has Dreams    David Tomlinson and Dick Van Dyke  This is a slower paced rendition of  The Life I Lead  which incorporates a brief reprise of  A Spoonful of Sugar    Feed the Birds    Orchestral and choral reprise  played over Mr  Banks s solitary walk to the bank at night   Let s Go Fly a Kite    Glynis Johns  David Tomlinson  Dick Van Dyke and others  Closing credits theme   Includes an instrumental reprise of  Spoonful of Sugar  followed by a choral reprise of  Let s Go Fly a Kite   In 2004   Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious  was ranked  36 in the American Film Institute s list of the 100 Greatest Songs in American film History   edit  Deleted songs A number of other songs were written for the film by the Sherman Brothers and either rejected or cut for time  Richard Sherman  on the 2004 DVD release  indicated that more than 30 songs were written at various stages of the film s development  No cast recordings of any of these songs have been released to the public  only demos or later performances done by the songwriters   with the exception of the rooftop reprise of  Chim Chim Cheree  and the  smoke staircase yodel  mentioned below   The Chimpanzoo   was originally to follow  I Love to Laugh  during the Uncle Albert  ceiling tea party  sequence  but it was dropped from the soundtrack just before Julie Andrews and company were to record it  The fast paced number was not unveiled to the public until Richard Sherman  aided by recently uncovered storyboards  performed it on the 2004 DVD edition  The re creation suggests it was to have been another sequence combining animation and live action   Practically Perfect  was intended to introduce Mary but instead the melody of the piece was used for  Sister Suffragette   used to introduce Winifred  Mrs  Banks    A different song with the same name was written for the stage musical   The Eyes of Love   a romantic ballad  was intended for Bert and Mary  but according to Richard Sherman  Julie Andrews suggested privately to Disney that this song was not suitable  In response   A Spoonful of Sugar  was written   Mary Poppins Melody  was to be performed when Mary introduces herself to the children  Elements of the song later became part of  Stay Awake   The melody was the basis for a couple of other songs that were ultimately cut from the film   A Name s a Name   Heard on a recording taken of a meeting between the Sherman Brothers and P L  Travers  this song was originally intended for the nursery scene that later became  A Spoonful of Sugar   The melody was reused for  Mary Poppins Melody    You Think  You Blink  was a short piece that Bert was to sing just before entering the chalk painting  and starting the  Jolly Holiday  sequence   In the film  Dick Van Dyke simply recites the lyric instead of singing it   West Wind  was a short ballad to be sung by Mary  The song was later retitled  Mon Amour Perdu  and used in the later Disney film  Big Red   The Right Side  was to be sung by Mary to Michael Banks after he gets out of bed cranky  It was recycled for the Disney Channel television series  Welcome to Pooh Corner as Winnie the Pooh s personal theme song   Measure Up  was to accompany the scene in which Mary takes the tape measure to Jane and Michael   Admiral Boom  was to be the theme song for the cannon firing neighbor of the Banks Residence  but it was cut by Walt Disney as being unnecessary  The melody of the song remains in the film  and the bombastic theme is heard whenever Boom appears onscreen  One line from this song   The whole world takes its time from Greenwich  but Greenwich  they say  takes its time from Admiral Boom    is spoken by Bert early in the film   Sticks  Paper and Strings  was an early version of  Let s Go Fly a Kite    Lead the Righteous Life   an intentionally poorly written hymn  was to have been sung by Katie Nanna  Elsa Lanchester  along with Jane and Michael prior to Mary Poppins  arrival  The melody was later reused for a similar song in The Happiest Millionaire  The Pearly Song  was not deleted per se but was instead incorporated into  Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious   The Compass Sequence  a precursor to  Jolly Holiday   was to be a multiple song sequence  A number of possible musical components have been identified   South Sea Island Symphony   Chinese Festival Song   Tim buc too    elements of this were reused for  The Chimpanzoo  which was also cut  Tiki Town    the melody was reused for  The Chimpanzoo   North Pole Polka   Land of Sand    later rewritten as  Trust in Me  for the animated version of The Jungle Book  The Beautiful Briny    later used in Bedknobs and Broomsticks  East is East    another variation on the unused  Mary Poppins Melody    edit  Deleted scores and music The  Step in Time  sequence ends with the chimney sweeps being scattered by an onslaught of fireworks fired from Admiral Boom s house  In the final film  the scene plays out with sound effects and no music  The DVD release included the original version of the scene which was accompanied by a complex instrumental musical arrangement that combined  Step in Time   the  Admiral Boom  melody  see above   and  A Spoonful of Sugar   This musical arrangement can be heard on the film s original soundtrack  Andrews recorded a brief reprise of  Chim Cheree  which was to have accompanied Mary  Bert  and the children as they marched across the rooftops of London  an instrumental reprise of  A Spoonful of Sugar  was used as a march instead  however  Andrews and Dick Van Dyke can still be seen and heard singing a reprise of  Chim Cheree  in that sequence  just before the other chimney sweeps appear for the  Step in Time  number   The robin Mary Poppins whistles with in  A Spoonful of Sugar  originally sang a lyric as well  Andrews also recorded a brief yodel which breaks into the first line of  A Spoonful of Sugar  which was to have been used to  activate  the smoke staircase prior to the  Step in Time  number  Although cut from the film  footage of Andrews performing this exists and was included on the 2004 DVD  The DVD also indicates that an alternate version of the yodel performed by Dick Van Dyke may also exist   edit  Awards and honors  edit  Academy Awards The film received 13 Academy Award nominations  it shares this record with Gone with the Wind  From Here to

Looked at a King In 2004  Julie Andrews appeared in a live action animated short that was produced by DisneyToon Studios for the 40th Anniversary DVD release of the 1964 film  Titled The Cat That Looked at a King  the film was based upon part of Travers s book Mary Poppins Opens the Door  and it could be seen as something of a sequel or follow up to the movie  The film was offered to The Answer Studio  which is partly made up of former employees of Walt Disney Animation  Japan   to be their first project  20  President Motoyoshi Tokunaga says that 20 artists animators worked on the film for a period of three months  20  The film opens in the modern day with two British children looking at chalk drawings at the same location where Bert did his artwork in the original movie   According to Julie Andrews  the set was re created  down to the last detail  using the originals   Andrews  dressed in modern clothes  greets the children and takes them into the chalk drawing where they watch the tale unfold  A cat  Tracey Ullman  comes into the presence of a king  David Ogden Stiers  who loves the facts and figures of the world more than anything else  Unfortunately  this includes his wife  the Queen  Sarah Ferguson  Duchess of York   The Cat and the King challenge each other to three questions each  if the Cat wins  she gets the kingdom but if the King wins  he will become the smartest man in the universe  The Cat wins all her questions whilst the King wins none  When the King tells them he does not know who he is anymore  the Cat shows an image of him dancing with the Queen  She declines her prize and is given a brooch as a token of thanks by the Queen  The children and Andrews return to the park entrance  where Andrews denies that she took them into the painting  as she did in the film  The Prime Minister was also voiced by David Ogden Stiers  Whether Andrews is playing a modern day Mary Poppins or not is left to the viewer s imagination  although some sources identify Andrews  character as Mary Poppins citation needed   The shadow of Mary Poppins can also be seen when she looks down at the live action cat towards the end  An orchestral reprise of  Feed the Birds  is heard to open the film and another reprise of Jolly Holiday is heard at the end  Quotes from the film such as Mary s catchphrase  Spit spot   and  I have no intention of making a spectacle of myself  thank you   are also featured  She also says   A respectable person like me in a painting  How dare you suggest such a thing   This parodies  A respectable person like me in a horse race  How dare you suggest such a thing    which she said when Jane and Michael told her of their adventure in Bert s chalk picture in the film   edit  See also Mary Poppins  musical  by Disney
