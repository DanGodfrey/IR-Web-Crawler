and Machalilla Culture on the coast  the Quitus  near present day Quito  and the Ca ari  near present day Cuenca   Each civilization developed its own distinctive architecture  pottery  and religious interests  although consolidated under a confederation called the Shyris which exercised organized trading and bartering between the different regions and whose political and military power was under the rule of the Duchicela blood line before the Inca invasion  After years of fiery resistance by the Ca aris and other tribes  as demonstrated by the battle of Yahuarcocha  Blood Lake  where thousands of resistance fighters were killed and thrown in the lake  the region fell to the Incan expansion and was assimilated loosely into the Incan empire  citation needed   edit  Inca Empire Through a succession of wars and marriages among the nations that inhabited the valley  the region became part of the Inca Empire in 1463  When the Spanish conquistadors arrived from the north  the Inca Empire was ruled by Huayna Capac  who had two sons  Atahualpa  being in charge of the northern parts of the empire  and Hu scar  seated in the Incan capital Cusco  Upon Huayna Capac s death in 1525  the empire was divided in two  Atahualpa received the north  with his capital in Quito  Hu scar received the south  with its capital in Cusco  In 1530  Atahualpa defeated his own brother  Hu scar  and claimed control over the entire empire  Atahualpa s victory was short lived as he was soon captured by the Spanish conquistadors in Cajamarca  and later executed for the murder of his brother  citation needed   edit  Colonization Spanish Historical Center in Quito Disease plagued the indigenous population during the first decades of Spanish rule   a time when the natives also were forced into the encomienda labor system for the Spanish  In 1563  Quito became the seat of a real audiencia  administrative district  of Spain and part of the Viceroyalty of Peru  and later the Viceroyalty of New Granada  After nearly 300 years of Spanish colonization  Quito was still a small city of only 10 000 inhabitants  It was here  on August 10  1809  that the first call for independence from Spain was made in Latin America  under the leadership of the city s criollos like Juan P o Mont far  Quiroga  Salinas  and Bishop Cuero y Caicedo  Quito s nickname   Luz de Am rica    Light of America    comes from the fact that this was the first successful attempt to produce an independent and local government  Although it lasted no more than two months  it had important repercussions and was an inspiration for the emancipation of the rest of Spanish America   edit  Independence The States of Ecuador  Cundinamarca  and Venezuela formed The Republic of Great Colombia  Main article  Ecuadorian War of Independence On October 9  1820  Guayaquil became the first city in Ecuador to gain its independence from Spain  On May 24  1822  the rest of Ecuador gained its independence after Antonio Jos  de Sucre defeated the Spanish Royalist forces at the Battle of Pichincha  near Quito  Following the battle  Ecuador joined Sim n Bol var s Republic of Gran Colombia   joining with modern day Colombia and Venezuela   only to become a republic in 1830  The 19th century for Ecuador was marked by instability  with a rapid succession of rulers  The first president of Ecuador was the Venezuelan born Juan Jos  Flores  who was ultimately deposed  followed by many authoritarian leaders such as Vicente Rocafuerte  Jos  Joaqu n de Olmedo  Jos  Mar a Urbina  Diego Noboa  Pedro Jos  de Arteta  Manuel de Asc subi  and Flores s own son  Antonio Flores Jij n  among others  The conservative Gabriel Garcia Moreno unified the country in the 1860s with the support of the Roman Catholic Church  In the late 19th century  world demand for cocoa tied the economy to commodity exports and led to migrations from the highlands to the agricultural frontier on the coast   edit

Peruvian territorial dispute Gran Colombia Peru War  1828 1829 Ecuadorian Peruvian territorial dispute of 1857 1860Ecuadorian Peruvian War  1941 Paquisha War  1981 Cenepa War  1995  Map of the dispute  Spanish  Ecuadorian troops during the conflict  Control over territory in the Amazon basin led to a long lasting dispute between Ecuador and Peru  In 1941  amid fast growing tensions between the two countries  war broke out  Peru claimed that Ecuador s military presence in Peruvian claimed territory was an invasion  Ecuador  for its part  claimed that Peru had invaded Ecuador  In July 1941  troops were mobilized in both countries  Peru had an army of 11 681 troops who faced a poorly supplied and inadequately armed Ecuadorian force of 2 300  of which only 1 300 were deployed in the southern provinces  Hostilities erupted on July 5  1941  when Peruvian forces crossed the Zarumilla river at several locations  testing the strength and resolve of the Ecuadorian border troops  Finally  on July 23  1941  the Peruvians launched a major invasion  crossing the Zarumilla river in force and advancing into the Ecuadorian province of El Oro  During the course of the war  Peru gained control over part of the disputed territory and some parts of the province of El Oro  and some parts of the province of Loja  demanding that the Ecuadorian government give up its territorial claims  The Peruvian Navy blocked the port of Guayaquil  almost cutting all supplies to the Ecuadorian troops  After a few weeks of war and under pressure by the United States and several Latin American nations  all fighting came to a stop  Ecuador and Peru came to an accord formalized in the Rio Protocol  signed on January 29  1942  in favor of hemispheric unity against the Axis Powers in World War II favoring Peru with the territory they occupied at the time the war came to an end  Recession and popular unrest led to a return to populist politics and domestic military interventions in the 1960s  while foreign companies developed oil resources in the Ecuadorian Amazon  In 1972  construction of the Andean pipeline was completed  The pipeline brought oil from the east side of the Andes to the coast  making Ecuador South America s second largest oil exporter  The pipeline in southern Ecuador did nothing  however  to resolve tensions between Ecuador and Peru  The Rio Protocol failed to precisely resolve the border along a small river in the remote Cordillera del C ndor region in southern Ecuador  This caused a long simmering dispute between Ecuador and Peru  which ultimately led to fighting between the two countries  first a border skirmish in January February 1981 known as the Paquisha Incident  and ultimately full scale warfare in January 1995 where the Ecuadorian military shot down Peruvian aircraft and helicopters and Peruvian infantry marched into southern Ecuador  Each country blamed the other for the onset of hostilities  known as the Cenepa War  Sixto Dur n Ball n  the Ecuadorian president  famously declared that he would not give up a single centimeter of Ecuador  Popular sentiment in Ecuador became strongly nationalistic against Peru  graffiti could be seen on the walls of Quito referring to Peru as the  Cain de Latinoam rica   a reference to the murder of Abel by his brother Cain in the Book of Genesis  12  Ecuador and Peru reached a tentative peace agreement in October 1998  which ended hostilities  and the Guarantors of the Rio Protocol ruled that the border of the undelineated zone was set the line of the Cordillera del C ndor  While Ecuador had to give up its decades old territorial claims to the eastern slopes of the Cordillera  as well as to the entire western area of Cenepa headwaters  Peru was compelled to give to Ecuador  in perpetual lease but without sovereignty  one square kilometre of its territory  in the area where the Ecuadorian base of Tiwinza   focal point of the war   had been located within Peruvian soil and which the Ecuadorian Army held as their strong hold all the time during the conflict  The final border demarcation came into effect on May 13  1999   edit  Military governments  1972 1979  In 1972  a  revolutionary and nationalist  military junta overthrew the government of Velasco Ibarra  The coup d  tat was led by General Guillermo Rodr guez and executed by navy commander Jorge Queirolo G  The new president exiled Jos  Mar a Velasco to Argentina  He remained in power until 1976  when he was removed by another military government  That military junta was led by Admiral Alfredo Poveda  who was declared chairman of the Supreme Council  The Supreme Council included two other members  General Guillermo Dur n Arcentales and General Luis Leoro Franco  The civil society more and more insistently called for democratic elections  Colonel Richelieu Levoyer  Government Minister  proposed and implemented a Plan to return to the constitutional system through universal elections  This Plan enabled the new democratically elected president to assume the duties of the executive office   edit  Return to democracy Elections were held on April 29  1979  under a new constitution  Jaime Rold s Aguilera was elected president  garnering over one million votes  the most in Ecuadorian history  He took office on August 10 as the first constitutionally elected president after nearly a decade of civilian and military dictatorships  In 1980  he founded the Partido Pueblo  Cambio y Democracia  People  Change and Democracy Party  after withdrawing from the Concentracion de Fuerzas Populares  Popular Forces Concentration  and governed until May 24  1981  when he died along with his wife and the minister of defense  Marco Subia Martinez  when his Air Force plane crashed in heavy rain near the Peruvian border  Many people believe that he was assassinated  citation needed  given the multiple death threats leveled against him because of his reformist agenda  deaths in automobile crashes of two key witnesses before they could testify during the investigation and the sometimes contradictory accounts of the incident  Roldos was immediately succeeded by Vice President Osvaldo Hurtado who was followed in 1984 by Le n Febres Cordero from the Social Christian Party  Rodrigo Borja Cevallos of the Democratic Left  Izquierda Democr tica or ID  party won the presidency in 1988  running in the runoff election against Abdal  Bucaram  brother in law of Jaime Roldos and founder of the Ecuadorian Roldosist Party   His government was committed to improving human rights protection and carried out some reforms  notably an opening of Ecuador to foreign trade  The Borja government concluded an accord leading to the disbanding of the small terrorist group    Alfaro Vive  Carajo     Alfaro Lives  Dammit    named after Eloy Alfaro  However  continuing economic problems undermined the popularity of the ID  and opposition parties gained control of Congress in 1990  The emergence of the indigenous population  approximately 25   as an active constituency has added to the democratic volatility of the country in recent years  The population has been motivated by government failures to deliver on promises of land reform  lower unemployment and provision of social services  and historical exploitation by the land holding elite  Their movement  along with the continuing destabilizing efforts by both the elite and leftist movements  has led to a deterioration of the executive office  The populace and the other branches of government give the president very little political capital  as illustrated by the most recent removal of President Lucio Guti rrez from office by Congress in April 2005  Vice President Alfredo Palacio took his place and remained in office until the presidential election of 2006  in which Rafael Correa gained the presidency  On September 30  2010  in a police revolt  many police officers were killed after a military intervention in a police hospital  President Rafael Correa alleged that he was taken hostage in the hospital by police officers as part of a series of protests against cuts to the benefits of public service workers that were part of a financial austerity package  What angered police and elements of the army was a law to end the practice of giving medals and bonuses with each promotion  It would also extend from five to seven years the usual period required for promotions  The government called the revolt a coup and declared a one week state of emergency which put the military in charge of public order and suspended civil liberties  Peru shut its border with Ecuador  13  Numerous social movements claim that civil rights have been violated by the government   edit  Politics Main article

Armed Forces  Fuerzas Armadas del Ecuador   consisting of the Army  Air Force and Navy  have responsibility for the preservation of the integrity and national sovereignty of the national territory  The military tradition starts in the Gran Colombia  where a sizeable army was stationed in Ecuador due to border disputes with Peru  which claimed territories under its political control when it was a Spanish vicerroyalty  Once the Gran Colombia was dissolved after the death of Sim n Bol var in 1830  Ecuador inherited the same border disputes and had the need of creating its own professional military force  So influential was the military in Ecuador in the early republican period  that its first decade was under the control of Gral  Juan Jose Flores  first president of Ecuador of Venezuelan origin  The Gral  Jose Ma  Urbina and Gral  Robles are examples of military figures who became president of the country in the early republican period  Due to the continuous border disputes with Peru  finally settled in the early 2000s  and due to the ongoing problem with the Colombian guerrilla insurgency infiltrating Amazonian provinces  the Ecuadorian Armed Forces has gone through a series of changes as an essential part of the country s existence  In 2009  the new administration at the Defense Ministry launched a deep restructuring within the forces  increasing spending budget to  1 691 776 803  an increase of 25    FY08  16  The icons of the Ecuadorian military forces are the Marshall Antonio Jos  de Sucre and Gral  Eloy Alfaro  The Military Academy  Gral  Eloy Alfaro   c

variety in the climate  largely determined by altitude  It is mild year round in the mountain valleys  Humid Subtropical Climate incoastal and Rain Forests in lowlands  The Pacific coastal area has a tropical climate  with a severe rainy season  The climate in the Andean highlands is temperate and relatively dry  and the Amazon basin on the eastern side of the mountains shares the climate of other rain forest zones  Because of its location at the equator  Ecuador experiences little variation in daylight hours during the course of a year  Both sunrise and sunset occur each day at the two six o clock hours  23   edit  Biodiversity Gal pagos tortoise Blue footed booby Ecuador is one of 17 megadiverse countries in the world according to Conservation International  9  and it has the most

will be protected  the type of ecosystem of the land to be protected among other factors  30  Despite being on the UNESCO list  the Gal pagos are endangered by a range of negative environmental effects  threatening the existence of this exotic ecosystem  31  Additionally  oil exploitation of the Amazon rain forest has led to the release of billions of gallons of untreated wastes  gas  and crude oil into the environment  contaminating ecosystems and causing detrimental health effects to indigenous peoples  32   edit  Economy Main article  Economy of Ecuador Refineries in Esmeraldas

market prices can have a substantial domestic impact  Industry is largely oriented to servicing the domestic market  with some exports to the Andean Community of Nations  Deteriorating economic performance in 1997 98 culminated in a severe economic and financial crisis in 1999  The crisis was precipitated by the El Ni o weather phenomenon in 1997  a sharp drop in global oil prices in 1997 98  and international emerging market instability in 1997 98  These factors resulted in a 7 3  contraction of GDP  annual year on year inflation of 52 2   and a 65  devaluation of the national currency  the Sucre  in 1999  which helped precipitate a default on external loans later that year  In January 2000  President Jamil Mahuad announced a policy to adopt the U S  dollar as the official currency

of those who want to exercise their affiliation with their native ethnic groups  Thus  in addition to criollos  mestizos  and Afro Ecuadorians  some people belong to the indigenous nations scattered in a few places in the coast  Quechua Andean villages  and the Amazonian jungle   edit  Immigration and emigration See also  Emigration from Ecuador A small east Asian Latino community  estimated at 2 500  mainly consists of those of Japanese and Chinese descent  whose ancestors arrived as miners  farmhands and fishermen in the late 19th century  41  In the early years of World War II  Ecuador still admitted a certain number of immigrants  and in 1939  when several South American countries refused to accept 165 Jewish refugees from Germany aboard the ship  Koenigstein   Ecuador granted them entry permits   edit  Culture Quito Main article  Culture of Ecuador Ecuador s mainstream culture is defined by its Hispanic mestizo majority  and like their ancestry  it is traditionally of Spanish heritage  influenced in different degrees by Amerindian traditions  and in some cases by African elements The first and most substantial wave of modern immigration to Ecuador consisted of Spanish colonists  following the arrival of Europeans in 1499  A lower number of other Europeans and North Americans migrated to the country in the late 19th and early twentieth centuries  and in smaller numbers  Poles  Lithuanians  English  Irish  and Croats during and after the Second World War  Since African slavery was not the workforce of the Spanish colonies in the  Terra Firme   South America   given the subjugation of the indigenous people through evangelism and encomiendas  the minority population of African descent is mostly found in the northern provinces of Esmeraldas and Imbabura  This is largely owing to the 17th century shipwreck of a slave trading galleon off the northern coast of Ecuador  The few black African survivors swam to the shore and penetrated the then thick jungle under the leadership of Anton  the chief of the group  where they remained as free men maintaining their original culture  not influenced by the typical elements found in other provinces of the coast or in the Andean region  Ecuador s indigenous communities are integrated into the mainstream culture to varying degrees  42  but some may also practice their own indigenous cultures  particularly the more remote indigenous communities of the Amazon basin  Spanish is spoken as the first language by more than 90  of the population  and as a first or second language by more than 98   Part of Ecuador s population can speak Amerindian languages  in some cases as a second language  Two percent of the population speak only Amerindian languages   edit  Cuisine Ecuadorian ceviche  made of shrimp and lemon  onions and some herbs  Tomato sauce and orange are used at some places  but does not form a part of the recipe Ecuadorian cuisine is diverse  varying with the altitude and associated agricultural conditions  Most regions in Ecuador follow the traditional three course meal of soup  a second course which includes rice and a protein such as meat or fish  and then dessert and coffee to finish  Supper is usually lighter  and sometimes consists only of coffee or herbal tea with bread  In the highland region  pork  chicken  beef  and cuy  guinea pig  are popular and are served with a variety of grains  especially rice and corn  or potatoes  In the coastal region  seafood is very popular  with fish  shrimp and ceviche being key parts of the diet  Generally  ceviches are served with fried plantain  chifles   popcorn or tostado  Plantain  and peanut based dishes are the basis of most coastal meals  Encocados  dishes that contain a coconut sauce  are also very popular  Churrasco is a staple food of the Coast Region  especially Guayaquil  Arroz con menestra y carne asada  rice with beans and grilled beef  is one of the traditional dishes of Guayaquil  as is fried plantain which is often served with it  In the Amazon region  a dietary staple is the yuca  elsewhere called cassava  Many fruits are available in this region  including bananas  tree grapes  and peach palms  This region is a leading producer of bananas  cacao beans  to make chocolate   shrimp  tilapia  mangos and passion fruit  among other products   edit  Literature Luis Alberto Costales  Riobamba Early literature in colonial Ecuador  as in the rest of Spanish America  was influenced by the Spanish Golden Age  One of the earliest examples is Jacinto Collahuazo  43  an indigenous chief of a northern village in today s Ibarra  born in the late 1600s  Despite the early repression and discrimination of the native people by the Spanish  Collahuazo learned to read and write in Castilian  but his work was written in Quechua  The use of the Quipu was banned by the Spanish  44  and in order to preserve their work  many Inca poets had to resort to the use of the Latin alphabet to write in their native Quechua language  The history behind the Inca drama  Ollantay   the oldest literary piece in existence for any indigenous language in America  45  shares some similarities with the work of Collahuazo  Collahuazo was imprisoned  and all of his work burned  The existence of his literary work came to light many centuries later  when a crew of masons was restoring the walls of a colonial church in Quito  and found a hidden manuscript  The salvaged fragment is a Spanish translation from Quechua of the  Elegy to the Dead of Atahualpa   43  a poem written by Collahuazo  which describes the sadness and impotence of the Inca people of having lost their king Atahualpa  Other early Ecuadorian writers include the Jesuits Juan Bautista Aguirre  born in Daule in 1725  and Father Juan de Velasco  born in Riobamba in 1727  De Velasco wrote about the nations and chiefdoms that had existed in the Kingdom of Quito  today Ecuador  before the arrival of the Spanish  His historical accounts are nationalistic  featuring a romantic perspective of precolonial history  Famous authors from the late colonial and early republic period include  Eugenio Espejo a printer and main author of the first newspaper in Ecuadorian colonial times  Jose Joaquin de Olmedo  born in Guayaquil   famous for his ode to Sim n Bol var titled Victoria de Junin  Juan Montalvo  a prominent essayist and novelist  Juan Leon Mera  famous for his work  Cumanda  or  Tragedy among Savages  and the Ecuadorian National Anthem  Juan A  Martinez with A la Costa  Dolores Veintimilla  46  and others  Contemporary Ecuadorian writers include the novelist Jorge Enrique Adoum  the poet Jorge Carrera Andrade  the essayist Benjam n Carri n  the poets Medardo Angel Silva  Jorge Carrera Andrade  the novelist Enrique Gil Gilbert  the novelist Jorge Icaza  author of the novel Huasipungo  translated to many languages   the short story author Pablo Palacio  the novelist Alicia Yanez Cossio   edit  Art The best known art styles from Ecuador belonged to the Escuela Quite a  which developed from the 16th to 18th centuries  examples of which are on display in various old churches in Quito  Ecuadorian painters include  Oswaldo Guayasam n  Camilo Egas and Eduardo Kingman from the Indiginist Movement  Manuel Rendon  Jaime Zapata  Enrique T bara  An bal Villac s  Theo Constant   Le n Ricaurte and Estuardo Maldonado from the Informalist Movement  and Luis Burgos Flor with his abstract  Futuristic style  The indigenous people of Tigua  Ecuador are also world renowned for their traditional paintings   edit  Sport Estadio Monumental of Guayaquil  The most popular sport in Ecuador  as in most South American countries  is football  soccer   Its best known professional teams include Barcelona and Emelec from Guayaquil  LDU Quito  Deportivo Quito  and El Nacional from Quito  Olmedo from Riobamba  and Deportivo Cuenca from Cuenca  Currently the most successful football club in Ecuador is LDU Quito  and it is the only Ecuadorian club that have won the Copa Libertadores  the Copa Sudamericana and the Recopa Sudamericana  they were also runners up in the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup  The matches of the Ecuadorian national team are the most watched sporting events in the country  Ecuador qualified for the final rounds of both the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups  The 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign was considered a huge success for the country and its inhabitants  Ecuador finished in 2nd place on the qualifiers behind Argentina and above the team that would become World Champion  Brazil  In the 2006 FIFA World Cup  Ecuador finished ahead of Poland and Costa Rica to come in second to Germany in Group A in the 2006 World Cup  Futsal  often referred to as  ndor  is particularly popular for mass participation  There is considerable interest in tennis in the middle and upper classes of Ecuadorian society  and several Ecuadorian professional players have attained international fame  Basketball has a high profile  while Ecuador s specialties include Ecuavolley  a three person variation of volleyball  Bullfighting is practiced at a professional level in Quito  during the annual festivities that commemorate the Spanish founding of the city  and it also features in festivals in many smaller towns  Rugby union is found to some extent in Ecuador  with teams in Guayaquil  47  Quito  48  and Cuenca  Ecuador has won only two medals in the Olympic Games  both gained by 20 km racewalker Jefferson P rez  who took gold in the 1996 games  and silver 12 years later  P rez also set a world best in the 2003 World Championships of 1 17 21 for the 20 km distance  49   edit  Health Main article  Health in Ecuador Biblioteca Municipal de Guayaquil The current structure of the Ecuadorian public health care system dates back to 1967  50  51  The Ministry of the Public Health  Ministerio de Salud Publica del Ecuador  is the responsible entity of the regulation and creation of the public health policies and health care plans  The  Minister of Public Health  is appointed directly by the President of the republic  The current minister or Ecuadorian general surgeon  is Dr  David Chiriboga  a specialist and investigator in communitarian medicine  52  The philosophy of the Ministry of Public Health is the social support and service to the most vulnerable population 53  and its main plan of action lies around communitarian health and preventive medicine  53  The public health care system allows patients to be attended daily in public general hospitals  with no previous appointment by general practitioners and specialists in the  External Consultation   Consulta Externa  at no cost  This is done in the 4th basic specialties of pediatric  gynecology  clinic medicine  and surgery  54  There are also public hospitals specialized to treat chronic diseases  target a particular group of the population  or to provide a better attention in some medical specialties  Some examples in this group are the Gynecologic Hospitals or Maternities  Children Hospitals  Geriatric Hospitals and Oncology Institutes  Although well equipped  general hospitals are found in the major cities or capitals of province  there are basic hospitals in the smaller towns and canton cities  for family care consultation and treatments in pediatrics  gynecology  clinic medicine  and surgery  54  Community health care centers  Centros de Salud   are found inside metropolitan areas of cities and in rural areas  These are Day Hospitals with attention to patients whose hospitalization is inferior to 24 hours  54  The doctors assigned to rural communities  where the population of indigenous people can be substantial  have under their responsibility small clinics for the attention of the patients in the same fashion as the Day Hospitals in the major cities  The attention in this case observes and respect the culture of the community  54  The public health care system should not be confused with the Ecuadorian Social Security health care service which is dedicated to the individuals with formal employment and who are affiliated obligatorily through their employers  Citizens with no formal employment  may still tribute to the social security system voluntarily and have access to the medical services rendered by the social security system  The Ecuadorian Institute of Social Security  IESS  has under its administration several major hospitals and medical sub centers across the nation  55  Ecuadorians have a life expectancy of 75 years  56  The infant mortality rate is 13 per 1 000 live births  57  a major improvement from approximately 76 in the early 1980s and 140 in 1950  58  23  of children under five are chronically malnourished  57  Population in some rural areas have no access to potable water and its supply is provided by mean of water tankers  There are 686 malaria cases per 100 000 people  59  Basic health care  including doctor s visits  basic surgeries  and basic medications  has been provided free since 2008  57  However  some public hospitals are in poor condition and often lack necessary supplies to attend the high demand of patients  Private hospitals and clinics are well equipped but still expensive for the majority of the population   edit  Education File Ecuadorian Students jpg Ecuadorian schoolboys in 1907  The Ecuadorian Constitution requires that all children attend school until they achieve a  basic level of education   which is estimated at nine school years  60  In 1996  the net primary enrollment rate was 96 9 percent  and 71 8 percent of children stayed in school until the fifth grade  60  The cost of primary and secondary education is borne by the government  but families often face significant additional expenses such as fees and transportation costs  60  Provision of public schools falls far below the levels needed  and class sizes are often very large  and families of limited means often find it necessary to pay for education  In rural areas  only 10  of the children go on to high school  The Ministry of Education states that the mean number of years completed is 6 7  Ecuador has 61 universities  many of which still confer terminal degrees according to the traditional Spanish education system  61  honoring a long tradition of having some of the oldest universities in the Americas  University of San Fulgencio founded in 1586 by the Augustines  San Gregorio Magno University founded in 1651 by the Jesuits  and University of Santo Tomas of Aquino  founded in 1681 by the Dominican order  Among the traditional conferred terminal degrees can be noted the Doctorate for medicine and law schools  Engineer  Physicist  Chemist  or Mathematician for polytechnic or technology institutes  These terminal degrees  as in the case of the Ph D  in other countries  were the main requirement for an individual to be accepted in academia as a professor or researcher  In the professional realm  a terminal degree granted by an accredited institution provided automatically a professional license to the individual  Maldonado s High School Riobamba However  in 2004 the National Council of Higher Education  CONESUP   started the reorganization of all the degree grating schemes of the accredited universities in order to pair them with foreign counterparts  The new structure of some careers caused the dropping of subjects  credits or even the name of the previously conferred diplomas  The terminal degree in law  previously known as J D  Juris Doctor  Doctor en Jurisprudencia  was replaced by the one of attorney  Abogado  with the exception of the modification of the number of credits to equate it to an undergraduate degree  In the same fashion for Med School  the required time of education was considerably reduced from 9 years  the minimum needed to obtain the title of M D  Doctor in Medicine and Surgery  to almost five  with the provision that the diploma is not terminal anymore and it is given with the title of Medic  Medico   Therefore  an M D  or Ph D  in medicine is only to be obtained overseas until the universities adjust themselves to granting schemes and curriculum as in foreign counterparts  Nonetheless  a  medico  can start a career as family practitioner or general medicine physician  This new reorganization  although very ambitious  lacked the proper path to the homologation of diplomas for highly educated professionals graduated in the country or even for the ones graduated in foreign institutions  One of the points of conflict was the imposition of obtaining foreign degrees to current academicians  As today  a master degree is as a requirement to keep an academic position and at least a foreign Ph D  to attain or retain the status of Rector  President of a university  or Decano  Dean   For Ecuadorian researchers and many academicians trained in the country  these regulations sounded illogical  disappointing  and unlawful since it appeared a question of a title name conflict rather than specialization or science advancement  A debate to modify this and other reforms  specially the one which granted control of the Higher Education System by the government  was practically passed with consensus by the multi partisan National Assembly on August 4  2010 but vetoed by the president Rafael Correa  who wanted to keep the law strictly as it was originally redacted by his political party and SENPLADES  National Secretary of Planning and Development   Due to this change  there are many highly educated professionals and academicians under the old structure but estimated that only 87  of the faculty in public universities have already obtained a master s degree and fewer than 5  have Ph D   although many of them have already Ecuadorian granted Doctorate degrees   About 300 institutes of higher education offer two to three years of post secondary vocational or technical training   edit  Sciences and research The most notable icons in Ecuadorian sciences are the mathematician and cartographer Pedro Vicente Maldonado  born in Riobamba in 1707  and the printer  independence precursor  and medical pioneer Eugenio Espejo  born in 1747 in Quito  Among other notable Ecuadorian scientists and engineers are Lieutenant Jose Rodriguez Lavandera  62  a pioneer who built the first submarine in Latin America in 1837  Reinaldo Espinosa Aguilar  1898 1950   a botanist and biologist of Andean flora  and Jos  Aurelio Abelardo Due as  1880 1961   a chemist and inventor of a method of textile serigraphy  The major areas of scientific research in Ecuador have been in the medical fields  tropical and infectious diseases treatments  agricultural engineering  pharmaceutical research  and bioengineering  Being a small country and consumer of foreign technology  Ecuador has favored the research supported by entrepreneurship in information technology  The antivirus Checkprogram and banking protection system MdLock and the Core Banking Software Cobis are a product of Ecuadorian development  63  The scientific production in hard sciences has been limited due to lack of funding but focused around science of materials in Physics and Statistics in Mathematics  In the case of engineering fields  the majority of the scientific production comes from the top three polytechnic institutions  ESPOL  Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral   ESPE  Escuela Superior Politecnica del Ejercito  and EPN  Escuela Politecnica Nacional   Contemporary Ecuadorian scientists who have been recognized by international institutions are Eugenia del Pino  born 1945   the first Ecuadorian to be elected to the United States National Academy of Science  and Arturo Villavicencio  who was part of the working group of the IPCC which shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore for their dissemination of the effects of climate change  Currently  the politics of research and investigation are managed by the National Secretary of Higher Education  Science and Technology Senescyt  64   edit  See also Geography portal Latin America portal South America portal Ecuador portal Outline of
