state  10  and the third most extensive  after Alaska and Texas   It is home to the nation s second  and sixth largest census statistical areas  Los Angeles Metropolitan Area and San Francisco Bay Area   and eight of the nation s fifty most populated cities  Los Angeles  San Diego  San Jose  San Francisco  Fresno  Sacramento  Long Beach and Oakland   11  The capital city is Sacramento  California s diverse geography ranges from the Pacific Coast in the west  to the Sierra Nevada mountains in the east   from the Redwood Douglas fir forests of the northwest  to the Mojave Desert areas in the southeast  The center of the state is dominated by Central Valley  a major agricultural area  California contains both the highest and lowest points in the contiguous United States  Mount Whitney and Death Valley   and has the third longest coastline of all states  after Alaska and Florida   Earthquakes are a common occurrence due to the state s location along the Pacific Ring of Fire  about 37 000 are recorded annually  12  The name California once referred to a large area of North America claimed by Spain that included much of modern day Southwestern United States and the Baja California peninsula  Beginning in the late 18th century  the area known as Alta California  comprising the California territory north of the Baja Peninsula  was colonized by the Spanish Empire as part of New Spain  In 1821  Alta California became a part of Mexico following its successful war for independence  Shortly after the beginning of the Mexican American War in 1846  a group of American settlers in Sonoma declared an independent California Republic in Alta California  Though its existence was short lived  its flag became the precursor for California s current state flag  American victory in the war led to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo  in which Mexico ceded Alta California to the United States  Western areas of Alta California became the state of California  which was admitted as the 31st state on September 9  1850  The California Gold Rush beginning in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic change  with large scale immigration from the U S  and abroad and an accompanying economic boom  Key developments in the early 20th century included the emergence of Los Angeles as the center of the American entertainment industry  and the growth of a large  state wide tourism sector  The late 20th century saw the development of the technology and information sectors  punctuated by the growth of Silicon Valley  In addition to California s prosperous agricultural industry  other important contributors to its economy include aerospace  education  and manufacturing  If California were a country  it would be the eighth largest economy in the world 13  and the 34th most populous nation  At least half of the fresh fruit produced in the United States are cultivated in California  and it also leads in the production of vegetables  14  Contents 1 Etymology 2

California peninsula of Mexico  the current U S  states of California  Nevada  and Utah  and parts of Arizona  New Mexico  and Wyoming  The name California is most commonly believed to have derived from a fictional paradise peopled by Black Amazons and ruled by Queen Calafia  15  16  The story of Calafia is recorded in a 1510 work The Exploits of Esplandian  written as a sequel to Amadis de Gaula by Spanish adventure writer Garci Rodr guez de Montalvo  17  18  19  The kingdom of Queen Calafia  according to Montalvo  was said to be a remote land inhabited by griffins and other strange beasts  and rich in gold  Know ye that at the right hand of the Indies there is an island called California  very close to that part of the Terrestrial Paradise  which was inhabited by black women without a single man among them  and they lived in the manner of Amazons  They were robust of body with strong passionate hearts and great virtue  The island itself is one of the wildest in the world on account of the bold and craggy rocks  20  The name California is the fifth oldest surviving European place name in the U S  and was applied to what is now the southern tip of Baja California peninsula as the Island of California by a Spanish expedition led by Diego de Becerra and Fort n Xim nez  who landed there in 1533 at the behest of Hern n Cort s  note 1  Geography Main article  Geography of California Topographic map of California Aerial view of the California Central Valley Sierra Nevada Yosemite National Park Lake Tahoe California adjoins the Pacific Ocean to the west  Oregon to the north  Nevada and Arizona to the east  and the Mexican state of Baja California to the south  With an area of 160 000 square miles  414 000 km2   it is the third largest state in the United States in size  after Alaska and Texas  22  If it were a country  California would be the 59th largest in the world in area  In the middle of the state lies the California Central Valley  bounded by the coastal mountain ranges in the west  the Sierra Nevada to the east  the Cascade Range in the north and the Tehachapi Mountains in the south  The Central Valley is California s agricultural heartland and grows approximately one third of the nation s food  23  24  Divided in two by the Sacramento San Joaquin River Delta  the northern portion  the Sacramento Valley serves as the watershed of the Sacramento River  while the southern portion  the San Joaquin Valley is the watershed for the San Joaquin River  both areas derive their names from the rivers that transit them  With dredging  the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers have remained sufficiently deep that several inland cities are seaports  The Sacramento San Joaquin River Delta serves as a critical water supply hub for the state  Water is routed through an extensive network of canals and pumps out of the delta  that traverse nearly the length of the state  including the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project  Water from the Delta provides drinking water for nearly 23 million people  almost two thirds of the state s population  and provides water to farmers on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley  The Channel Islands are located off the southern coast  The Sierra Nevada  Spanish for  snowy range   includes the highest peak in the contiguous forty eight states  Mount Whitney  at 14 505 ft  4421 m   4  5  6  The range embraces Yosemite Valley  famous for its glacially carved domes  and Sequoia National Park  home to the giant sequoia trees  the largest living organisms on Earth  and the deep freshwater lake  Lake Tahoe  the largest lake in the state by volume  To the east of the Sierra Nevada are Owens Valley and Mono Lake  an essential migratory bird habitat  In the western part of the state is Clear Lake  the largest freshwater lake by area entirely in California  Though Lake Tahoe is larger  it is divided by the California Nevada border  The Sierra Nevada falls to Arctic temperatures in winter and has several dozen small glaciers  including Palisade Glacier  the southernmost glacier in the United States  About 45 percent of the state s total surface area is covered by forests  25  and California s diversity of pine species is unmatched by any other state  California contains more forestland than any other state except Alaska  Many of the trees in the California White Mountains are the oldest in the world  one Bristlecone pine has an age of 4 700 years  In the south is a large inland salt lake  the Salton Sea  The south central desert is called the Mojave  to the northeast of the Mojave lies Death Valley  which contains the lowest and hottest place in North America  the Badwater Basin at  282 feet   86 0 m   8  The horizontal distance from the nadir of Death Valley to the summit of Mount Whitney is less than 90 miles  140 km   Indeed  almost all of southeastern California is arid  hot desert  with routine extreme high temperatures during the summer  The southeastern border of California with Arizona is entirely formed by the Colorado River  from which the southern part of the state gets about half of its water  Along the California coast are several major metropolitan areas  including Greater Los Angeles Area  the San Francisco Bay Area  and the San Diego metropolitan area  As part of the Ring of Fire  California is subject to tsunamis  floods  droughts  Santa Ana winds  wildfires  landslides on steep terrain  and has several volcanoes  It sees numerous earthquakes due to several faults  in particular the San Andreas Fault  Climate Main article  Climate of California Snow on the mountains of Southern California  Death Valley  in the desert regions of Eastern California California s climate varies from Mediterranean to subarctic  Much of the state has a Mediterranean climate  with cool  rainy winters and dry summers  The cool California Current offshore often creates summer fog near the coast  Farther inland  one encounters colder winters and hotter summers  Northern parts of the state average higher annual rainfall than the south  California s mountain ranges influence the climate as well  some of the rainiest parts of the state are west facing mountain slopes  Northwestern California has a temperate climate  and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast  The high mountains  including the Sierra Nevada  have a mountain climate with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer  The east side of California s mountains produce a rain shadow  creating expansive deserts  The higher elevation deserts of eastern California see hot summers and cold winters  while the low deserts east of the southern California mountains experience hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters  Death Valley  a desert with large expanses below sea level  is considered the hottest location in North America  the highest temperature in the Western Hemisphere  134  F  57  C   was recorded there on July 10  1913  The lowest temperature in California was  45 F in 1937 in Boca  Ecology Main article  Ecology of California California is one of the richest and most diverse parts of the world  and includes some of the most endangered ecological communities  California is part of the Nearctic ecozone and spans a number of terrestrial ecoregions  26  California s large number of endemic species includes relict species  which have died out elsewhere  such as the Catalina Ironwood  Lyonothamnus floribundus   Many other endemics originated through differentiation or adaptive radiation  whereby multiple species develop from a common ancestor to take advantage of diverse ecological conditions such as the California lilac  Ceanothus   Many California endemics have become endangered  as urbanization  logging  overgrazing  and the introduction of exotic species have encroached on their habitat  Flora and fauna Giant sequoias in Calaveras Big Trees State Park Joshua trees in Inyo Mountains above Eureka Valley  California boasts several superlatives in its collection of flora  the largest trees  the tallest trees  and the oldest trees  California s native grasses are perennial plants  27  After European contact  these were generally replaced by invasive species of European annual grasses  and  in modern times  California s hills turn a characteristic golden brown in summer  28  Because California has the greatest diversity of climate and terrain  the state has six life zones which are the lower Sonoran  desert   upper Sonoran  foothill regions and some coastal lands   transition  coastal areas and moist northeastern counties   and the Canadian  Hudsonian  and Arctic Zones  comprising the state s highest elevations  29  Plant life in the dry climate of the lower Sonoran zone contains a diversity of native cactus  mesquite  and paloverde  The Joshua tree  Yucca brevifolia  is found in the Mojave Desert  Flowering plants include the dwarf desert poppy and a variety of asters  Fremont cottonwood and valley oak thrive in the Central Valley  The upper Sonoran zone includes the chaparral belt  characterized by forests of small shrubs  stunted trees  and herbaceous plants  Nemophila  mint  phacelia  viola  and the California poppy  Eschscholtzia californica    the state flower   also flourish in this zone  along with the lupine  more species of which occur here than anywhere else in the world  29  The transition zone includes most of California s forests with the redwood  Sequoia sempervirens  and the  big tree  or giant sequoia  Sequoia gigantea   among the oldest living things on earth  some are said to have lived at least 4 000 years   Tanbark oak  California laurel  Sugar Pine  madrona  broad leaved maple  and Douglas fir also grow here  Forest floors are covered with swordfern  alumnroot  barrenwort  and trillium  and there are tickets of huckleberry  azalea  elder  and wild currant  Characteristic wild flowers include varieties of mariposa  tulip  and tiger and leopard lilies  30  The high elevations of the Canadian zone allow the Jeffrey Pine  red fir  and Lodgepole Pine to thrive  Brushy areas are abundant with dwarf manzanita and ceanothus  the unique Sierra puffball is also found here  Right below the timeberline  in the Hudsonian zone  the whitebark  foxtail  and silver pines grow  At about 10 500 ft  3 200 m   begins the Arctic zone  a treeless region whose flora include a number of wildflowers  including Sierra primrose  yellow columbine  alpine buttercup  and alpine shooting star  29  31  Common plants that have been introduced to the state include the eucalyptus  acacia  pepper tree  geranium  and Scotch broom  The species that are federally classified as endangered are the Contra Costa wallflower  Antioch Dunes evening primrose  Solano Grass  San Clemente Island larkspur  salt marsh bird s beak  McDonald s rock cress  and Santa Barbara Island Liveforever  As of December 1997 update   85 plant species were listed as threatened or endangered  29  In the deserts of the lower Sonoran zone  the mammals include the jackrabbit  kangaroo rat  squirrel  and opossum  Common birds include the owl  roadrunner  Cactus Wren  and various species of hawk  The area s reptilian life include the sidewinder viper  desert tortoise  and horned toad  The upper Sonoran zone boasts mammals such as the antelope  brown footed woodrat  and Ring tailed Cat  Birds unique to this zone are the California thrasher  bush tit  and California Condor  29  32  33  34  In the transition zone  there are Colombian Black tailed Deer  black bears  gray foxes  cougars  bobcats  and Roosevelt elk  Reptiles such as the garter snakes and rattlesnakes inhabit the zone  In addition  amphibians such as the water puppy and redwood salamander are common too  Birds such as the kingfisher  chickadee  towhee  and hummingbird thrive here as well  29  35  The Canadian zone mammals include the Mountain Weasel  Snowshoe Hare  Sierra chickadee  and several species of chipmunks  Conspicuous birds include the blue fronted jay  Sierra hermit thrush  water ouzel  and Townsend solitaire  As one ascends into the Hudsonian zone  birds become scarcer  While the Sierra rosy finch is the only bird native to the high Arctic region  other bird species such as the hummingbird and Clark s Nutcracker  Principal mammals found in this region include the Sierra coney  White tailed Jackrabbit  and the Bighorn Sheep  As of April 2003 update   the Bighorn Sheep was listed as endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service  The fauna found throughout several zones are the mule deer  coyote  mountain lion  Northern Flicker  and several species of hawk and sparrow  29  Aquatic life in California thrives  from the state s mountain lakes and streams to the rocky Pacific coastline  Numerous trout species are found  among them rainbow  golden  and Tahoe  Migratory species of salmon are common as well  Deep sea life forms include sea bass  yellowfin tuna  barracuda  and several types of whale  Native to the cliffs of northern California are seals  sea lions  and many types of shorebirds  including migratory species  29  As of April 2003  118 California animals were on the federal endangered list  181 plants were listed as endangered or threatened  Endangered animals include the San Joaquin kitfox  Point Arena mountain beaver  Pacific pocket mouse  Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse  Morro Bay kangaroo rat  and five other species of kangaroo rat   Amargosa vole  California Least Tern  California Condor  Loggerhead Shrike  San Clemente sage sparrow  San Francisco garter snake  five species of salamander  three species of chub  and two species of pupfish  Eleven butterflies are also endangered and two that are threatened are on the federal list  Among threatened animals are the coastal California Gnatcatcher  Paiute cutthroat trout  southern sea otter  and Northern Spotted Owl  California has a total of 290 821 acres  1 176 91 km2  of National Wildlife Refuges  29  As of September 2010 update   123 California animals were listed as either endangered or threatened on the federal list provided by the US Fish  amp  Wildlife Service  36  Also  as of the same year update   178 species of California plants were listed either as endangered or threatened on this federal list  36  Rivers Main article  List of rivers of California The state s coasts  rivers  and other bodies of water are looked after by the California Coastal Commission  The two most prominent rivers within California are the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River  which drain the Central Valley and the west slope of the Sierra Nevada and flow to the Pacific Ocean through San Francisco Bay  Several major tributaries feed into the Sacramento and the San Joaquin  including the Pit River  the Tuolumne River  and the Feather River  The Owens River takes runoff from the southeastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada and flows into Owens Lake  The Eel River and Salinas River each drain portions of the California coast  north and south of San Francisco Bay  respectively  The Mojave River is the primary watercourse in the Mojave Desert  and the Santa Ana River drains much of the Transverse Ranges as it bisects Southern California  Some other important rivers are the Klamath River and the Trinity River in the far north coast  and the Colorado River on the southeast border with Arizona  Regions for more  see List of regions of California and List of places in

History of California Settled by successive waves of arrivals during the last 10 000 years  California was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre Columbian North America  The Indigenous peoples of California included more than 70 distinct groups of Native Americans  Large  settled populations lived on the coast and hunted sea mammals  fished for salmon and gathered shellfish  groups in the interior hunted terrestrial game  and gathered nuts  acorns and berries  California groups also were diverse in their political organization with bands  tribes  villages  and on the resource rich coasts  large chiefdoms  such as the Chumash  Pomo and Salinan  Trade  intermarriage and military alliances fostered many social and economic relationships among the diverse groups  The first European to explore the coast as far north as the Russian River was the Portuguese Juan Rodr guez Cabrillo  in 1542  sailing for the Spanish Empire  Some 37 years later English explorer Francis Drake also explored and claimed an undefined portion of the California coast in 1579  Spanish traders made unintended visits with the Manila Galleons on their return trips from the Philippines beginning in 1565  37 Sebasti n Vizca no explored and mapped the coast of California in 1602 for New Spain  The Russians from Alaska established their largest settlement in California  Fort Ross  in 1812  Beginning in the 1820s  trappers and settlers from the U S  and Canada began to arrive in Northern California  harbingers of the great changes that would later sweep the Mexican territory  These new arrivals used the Siskiyou Trail  California Trail  Oregon Trail and Old Spanish Trail to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts surrounding California  In this period  Imperial Russia explored the California coast and established a trading post at Fort Ross  Spanish missionaries began setting up 21 California Missions along the coast of what became known as Alta California  Upper California   together with small towns and presidios  In 1821 the Mexican War of Independence gave Mexico  including California  independence from Spain  for the next 25 years  Alta California remained a remote northern province of the nation of Mexico  Cattle ranches  or ranchos  emerged as the dominant institutions of Mexican California  After Mexican independence from Spain  the chain of missions became the property of the Mexican government and were secularized by 1832  The ranchos developed under ownership by Californios  Spanish speaking Californians  who had received land grants  and traded cowhides and tallow with Boston merchants  San Francisco harbor c  1850  Between 1847 and 1870  the population of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150 000  In 1846 settlers rebelled against Mexican rule during the Bear Flag Revolt  Afterwards  rebels raised the Bear Flag  featuring a bear  a star  a red stripe and the words  California Republic   at Sonoma    We  overthrow a Government which has seized upon the property of the Missions for its individual aggrandizement  which has ruined and shamefully oppressed the laboring people of California    William Ide  Declaration from the Bear Flag Revolt The Republic s first and only president was William B  Ide  38  who played a pivotal role during the Bear Flag Revolt  His term lasted 22 days and concluded when California was occupied by U S  forces during the Mexican American War  The California Republic was short lived  The same year marked the outbreak of the Mexican American War  1846 1848   When Commodore John D  Sloat of the United States Navy sailed into Monterey Bay and began the military occupation of California by the United States  Northern California capitulated in less than a month to the U S  forces  After a series of defensive battles in Southern California  including The Siege of Los Angeles  the Battle of Dominguez Rancho  the Battle of San Pasqual  the Battle of Rio San Gabriel and the Battle of La Mesa  the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed by the Californios on January 13  1847  securing American control in California  Following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that ended the war  the region was divided between Mexico and the U S   the western territory of Alta California  was to become the U S  state of California  and Arizona  Nevada  Colorado and Utah became U S  Territories  while the lower region of California  the Baja Peninsula  remained in the possession of Mexico  In 1848 the non native population of California was estimated to be no more than 15 000  After gold was discovered  the population burgeoned with U S  citizens  Europeans and other immigrants during the great California Gold Rush  By 1854 over 300 000 settlers had come  39  On September 9  1850  as part of the Compromise of 1850  California was admitted to the United States undivided as a free state  denying the expansion of slavery to the Pacific Coast  Indigenous population in the 19th century 40  41  1848 150 000 1855 50 000 1865 34 000 1900 16 000 California s native population precipitously declined due to infections  starvation  and murder  The native inhabitants were forcefully removed from their lands by incoming miners  ranchers  and farmers and despite the fact that California entered the union as a free state  the Native population was enslaved under the 1853 Act for the Government and Protection of Indians  42  There were several massacres  including the Yontoket Massacre  the Bloody Island Massacre at Clear Lake  and the Old Shasta Massacre  in which hundreds of indigenous people were killed  Between 1850 and 1860  California paid around 1 5 million dollars  some 250 000 of which was reimbursed by the federal government  43  to hire militias whose purpose was to protect settlers from the indigenous populations  These  private military forays  were involved in several of the massacres  The first governor of California  Peter Burnett called for the extermination of the Indian tribes  44  As a result  the rise of California brought great hardship for the native inhabitants  Several scholars  including Benjamin Madley and Ed Castillo  have described the actions of the California government as a genocide  45  In subsequent decades  the native population was placed in reservations and rancherias  which were often very small and isolated and lacked adequate natural resources or funding from the government to sustain the populations living on them  42  In 1849 doctor of medicine and soldier Felix Wierzbicki published in San Francisco the first English language book printed in California 46   California as it is and As It May Be   47  48  49  Book is an  unvarnished  description of the culture  peoples  and climate of the area in 1849  Wierzbicki described prospective settlers that includes a survey of agriculture and hints on gold mining  50  The seat of government for California under Spanish and later Mexican rule was located at Monterey from 1777 until 1835  when Mexican authorities abandoned dubious   discuss  California  leaving their missions and military forts behind  51  In 1849 the Constitutional Convention was first held there  Among the duties was the task of determining the location for the new state capital  The first legislative sessions were held in San Jose  1850 1851   Subsequent locations included Vallejo  1852 1853   and nearby Benicia  1853 1854   these locations eventually proved to be inadequate as well  The capital has been located in Sacramento since 1854 52  with only a short break in 1861 when legislative sessions were held in San Francisco due to flooding in Sacramento  Hollywood film studios  1922 Travel between California and the central and eastern parts of the U S  was time consuming and dangerous  A more direct connection came in 1869 with the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad through Donner Pass in the Sierra Nevada mountains  After this rail link was established  hundreds of thousands of U S  citizens came west  where new Californians were discovering that land in the state  if irrigated during the dry summer months  was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general  Vast expanses of wheat  other cereal crops  vegetable crops  cotton  and nut and fruit trees were grown  including oranges in Southern California   and the foundation was laid for the state s prodigious agricultural production in the Central Valley and elsewhere  Migration to California accelerated during the early 20th century with the completion of major transcontinental highways like the Lincoln Highway and Route 66  In the period from 1900 to 1965  the population grew from fewer than one million to become the most populous state in the Union  In order to meet the population s needs  major engineering feats like the California and Los Angeles Aqueducts  the Oroville and Shasta Dams  and the Bay and Golden Gate Bridges were built across the state  The state government also adopted the California Master Plan for Higher Education in 1960 to develop a highly efficient system of public education  Meanwhile  attracted to the mild Mediterranean climate  cheap land  and the state s wide variety of geography  filmmakers established the studio system in Hollywood in the 1920s  A couple of decades later  Stanford University and its Dean of Engineering Frederick Terman began encouraging faculty and graduates to stay in California instead of leaving the state  and develop a high tech region in the area now known as Silicon Valley  53  As a result of these efforts  California is currently regarded as a world center of the entertainment and music industries  of technology and engineering businesses  and as the U S  center of agricultural production  Demographics The population density of California  Main article  Demographics of California Population Historical populations Census Pop     1850 92 597   1860

indigenous languages derived from 64 root languages in 6 language families  75  76  About half of the indigenous languages are no longer spoken  and all of California s living indigenous languages are endangered  There are some efforts toward language revitalization  such as for the Karuk language  The official language of California has been English since the passage of Proposition 63 in 1986  77  However  many state  city  and local government agencies still continue to print official public documents in numerous languages  78  For example  the California Department of Motor Vehicles offers

in San Francisco  The culture of California is a Western culture and most clearly has its modern roots in the culture of the United States  but also  historically  many Hispanic influences  As a border and coastal state  Californian culture has been greatly influenced by several large immigrant populations  especially those from Latin America  80  California has long been a subject of interest in the public mind and has often been promoted by its boosters as a kind of paradise  In the early 20th Century  fueled by the efforts of state and local boosters  many Americans saw the Golden State as an ideal resort destination  sunny and dry all year round with easy access to the ocean and mountains  In the 1960s  popular music groups such as The Beach Boys promoted the image of

from Spain  Roman Catholics founded 21 missions along the California coast  as well as the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco  California continues to have a large Roman Catholic population due to the large numbers of Mexicans and Central Americans living within its borders  California has twelve dioceses and two archdioceses  the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and the Archdiocese of San Francisco  the former being the largest archdiocese in the United States  A Pew Research Center survey revealed that California is somewhat less religious than the rest of the US  62 percent of

international related commerce accounts for approximately one quarter of the state s economy  In 2008  California exported  144 billion worth of goods  up from  134 billion in 2007 and  127 billion in 2006  91  Computers and electronic products are California s top export  accounting for 42 percent of all the state s exports in 2008  91  Agriculture is an important sector in California s economy  Farming related sales more than quadrupled over the past three decades  from  7 3 billion in 1974 to nearly  31 billion in 2004  92  This increase has occurred despite a 15 percent decline in acreage devoted to farming during the period  and water supply suffering from chronic instability  Factors contributing to the growth in sales per acre include more intensive use of active farmlands and technological improvements in crop production  92  In 2008  California s 81 500 farms and ranches generated  36 2 billion products revenue  93  Per capita GDP in 2007 was  38 956  ranking eleventh in

budget crisis California levies a 9 3 percent maximum variable rate income tax  with six tax brackets  collecting about  40 billion per year  representing approximately 51  of General Fund revenue and 40  of tax revenue overall in FY2007   97  California has a state sales tax of 8 25   which can total up to 10 75  with local sales tax included  98  All real property is taxable annually  the tax based on the property s fair market value at the time of purchase or completion of new construction  Property tax increases are capped at 2  per year  see Proposition 13   However  California is facing a  26 3 billion budget deficit for the 2009 2010 budget year  99  While the legislative bodies appeared to address the problem in 2008 with the three month delayed passage of a budget they in fact only postponed the deficit to 2009 and due to the late 2008 decline in the economy and the credit crisis the problem became urgent in November 2008  One potential problem is that a substantial portion of the state s income comes from income taxes on a small proportion of wealthy citizens  For example  it is estimated that in 2004 the richest 3  of state taxpayers  those with tax returns showing over  200 000 in yearly income  paid approximately 60  of state income taxes  100  The taxable income of this population is highly dependent upon capital gains  which has been severely impacted by the stock market declines of this period  The governor has proposed a combination of extensive program cuts and tax increases to address this problem  but owing to longstanding problems in the legislature these proposals are likely to be difficult to pass as legislation  State spending increased from  56 billion in 1998 to  131 billion in 2008  and the state was facing a budget deficit of  40 billion in 2008  101  California is facing another budget gap for 2010  102  with  72 billion in debt  103  In 2009 the California economic crisis became severe as the state faced insolvency

the state s budget  105  Infrastructure Energy Main article  Energy use in California A small segment of the San Gorgonio Pass Wind Farm  Because it is the most populous U S  state  California is one of the country s largest users of energy  However because of its mild weather and strong environmental movement  its per capita energy use is one of the smallest of any U S  state  106  Due to the high electricity demand  California imports more electricity than any other state  primarily hydroelectric power from states in the Pacific Northwest  via Path 15 and Path 66  and coal  and natural gas fired production from the desert Southwest via Path 46  107  As a result of the state s strong environmental movement  California has the some of the most aggressive renewable energy goals in the United States  with a target for California to obtain a third of its electricity from renewables by 2020  108  Currently  several solar power plants such as the Solar Energy Generating Systems facility are located in the Mojave Desert  California s wind farms include Altamont Pass  San Gorgonio Pass  and Tehachapi Pass  And a number of dams across the state also provide hydro electric power  The state s crude oil and natural gas deposits are located in the Central Valley and along the coast  including the large Midway Sunset Oil Field  Natural gas fired power plants typically account for more than one half of State electricity generation  California is also home to two major nuclear power plants  Diablo Canyon and San Onofre  However  voters banned the approval of new nuclear power plants since the late 1970s because of concerns over radioactive waste disposal  109  note 3  In addition  several cities such as Oakland  Berkeley and Davis have declared themselves as nuclear free zones  Transportation Main article  Transportation of California The Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco  one of California s most famous landmarks  Caltrans builds tall  stack  interchanges with

maintenance of state roads and statewide transportation planning are primarily the responsibility of the California Department of Transportation  nicknamed  Caltrans   The rapidly growing population of the state is straining all of its transportation networks  and California has some of the worst roads in the United States  111  112  The Reason Foundation s 19th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems ranked California s highways the third worst of any state  with Alaska second  and Rhode Island first  113  One of the state s more visible landmarks  the Golden Gate Bridge was completed in 1937  With its orange paint and panoramic views of the bay  this highway bridge is a popular tourist attraction and also accommodates pedestrians and bicyclists  It is simultaneously designated as U S  Route 101  which is part of the El Camino Real  Spanish for Royal Road or King s Highway   and State Route 1  also known as the Pacific Coast Highway  Another of the seven bridges in the San Francisco Bay Area is the San Francisco   Oakland Bay Bridge  often abbreviated the  Bay Bridge    completed in 1936  This bridge transports approximately 280 000 vehicles per day on two decks  with its two sections meeting at Yerba Buena Island  Los Angeles International Airport and San Francisco International Airport are major hubs for trans Pacific and transcontinental traffic  There are about a dozen important commercial airports and many more general aviation airports throughout the state  California also has several important seaports  The giant seaport complex formed by

explicitly based upon English common law 119   as is the case with all other states except Louisiana  but carries a few features from Spanish civil law  such as community property  Capital punishment is a legal form of punishment and the state has the largest  Death Row  population in the country  though Texas is far more active in carrying out executions   California s  Death Row  is in San Quentin State Prison situated north of San Francisco in Marin County  Executions in California are currently on hold indefinitely as human rights issues are addressed  120  California s prison population grew from 25 000 in 1980 to over 170 000 in 2007  121  California s judiciary is the largest in the United States  with a total of 1 600 judges  while the federal system has only about 840

of the country  and is sometimes regarded as a trendsetter  122  It was the second state to recall their state governor  the second state to legalize abortion  and the only state to ban marriage for gay couples twice by voters  including Proposition 8 in 2008   Voters also passed Proposition 71 in 2004 to fund stem cell research  and Proposition 14 in 2010 to completely change the state s primary election process  California has also experienced disputes over water rights  and a tax revolt  culminating with the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978  limiting state property taxes  What has been consistent in the last few decades is that California politics has trended towards the Democratic Party and away from the Republican Party  From 1899 to 1939  California had Republican governors  Once very conservative  having elected Republicans until 1958  California is now a reliable liberal  Democratic state  Since 1990  California has generally elected Democratic candidates to federal  state and local offices  including current Governor Jerry Brown  however  the state has elected Republican Governors  though many of its Republican Governors  such as Arnold Schwarzenegger  tend to be considered  Moderate Republicans  and more centrist than the national party  The Democrats also hold a majority in both houses of the state legislature  There are currently 52 Democrats and 27 Republicans in the Assembly  and 25 Democrats and 15 Republicans in the Senate  The trend towards the Democratic Party is most obvious in presidential elections  the Democratic Party candidate has won California s electoral votes in the last five elections  Additionally  both the state s current Democratic U S  Senators  Dianne Feinstein  a native and former mayor of San Francisco  and Barbara Boxer  a former congresswoman from Marin County  have held onto their seats since they were first elected in 1992  In the U S  House  the Democrats have held a 34 19 edge since the seating of the 110th United States Congress in 2007  As the result of gerrymandering  the districts in California are usually dominated by one or the other party with very few districts that could be considered competitive  In general  Democratic strength is centered in coastal regions of Los Angeles County and the San Francisco Bay Area  Republican strength is still greatest in eastern parts of the state  Orange County also remains mostly Republican  One study ranked Berkeley  Oakland  Inglewood and San Francisco in the top 10 most liberal American cities  and Bakersfield and Orange in the top 10 most
