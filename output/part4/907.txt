largest island in Europe and the twentieth largest island on Earth  4  To its east is the larger island of Great Britain  from which it is separated by the Irish Sea  Politically  the island is divided between the Republic of Ireland  which covers just under five sixths of the island  and Northern Ireland  a part of the United Kingdom  which covers the remainder and is located in the northeast of the island  The population of Ireland is approximately 6 4 million  Just under 4 6 million live in the Republic of Ireland and just under 1 8 million live in Northern Ireland  3  Relatively low lying mountains surrounding a central plain epitomise Ireland s geography with several navigable rivers extending inland  The island has lush vegetation  a product of its mild but changeable oceanic climate  which avoids extremes in temperature  Thick woodlands covered the island until the 17th century  Today  it is one of the most deforested areas in Europe  5  6  There are twenty six extant mammal species native to Ireland  A Norman invasion in the Middle Ages gave way to a Gaelic resurgence in the 13th century  Over sixty years of intermittent warfare in the 1500s led to English dominance after 1603  In the 1690s  a system of Protestant English rule was designed to materially disadvantage the Catholic majority and Protestant dissenters  and was extended during the 18th century  In 1801  Ireland became a part of the United Kingdom  A war of independence in the early 20th century led to the partition of the island  creating the Irish Free State  which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades  Northern Ireland remained a part of the United Kingdom and saw much civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s  This subsided following a political agreement in 1998  In 1973  both parts of Ireland joined the European Economic Community  Irish culture has had a significant influence on other cultures  particularly in the fields of literature and  to a lesser degree  science and education  A strong indigenous culture exists  as expressed for example through Gaelic games  Irish music and the Irish language  alongside mainstream Western culture  such as contemporary music and drama  and a culture shared in common with Great Britain  as expressed through sports such as soccer  rugby  horse racing  and golf  and the English language  Contents 1 History 1 1 Pre history 1 2 Late antiquity and early medieval times 1 3 Norse Viking invasions 1 4 Norman and English invasions 1 5 Kingdom of Ireland 1 6 Union with Great Britain

covered with ice until the end of the last ice age over 9 000 years ago  Sea levels were lower and Ireland  like Great Britain  was part of continental Europe  Mesolithic stone age inhabitants arrived some time after 8 000 BC and agriculture followed with the Neolithic Age around 4 500 to 4 000 BC when sheep  goats  cattle and cereals were imported from the Iberian peninsula  At the C ide Fields  preserved beneath a blanket of peat in present day County Mayo  is an extensive field system  arguably the oldest in the world  7  dating from not long after this period  Consisting of small divisions separated by dry stone walls  the fields were farmed for several centuries between 3 500 and 3 000 BC  Wheat and barley were the principal crops  The Bronze Age   defined by the use of metal   began around 2 500 BC  with technology changing people s everyday lives during this period through innovations such as the wheel  harnessing oxen  weaving textiles  brewing alcohol  and skillful metalworking  which produced new weapons and tools  along with fine gold decoration and jewellery  such as brooches and torcs  According to John T  Koch and others  Ireland in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading networked culture called the Atlantic Bronze Age that also included Britain  France  Spain and Portugal where Celtic languages developed  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  The Uragh Stone Circle a Neolithic stone circle in Gleninchaquin Park  County Kerry  The Iron Age in Ireland is traditionally associated with people known as the Celts  The Celts were commonly thought to have colonised Ireland in a series of invasions between the 8th and 1st centuries BC  The Gaels  the last wave of Celts  were said to have divided the island into five or more kingdoms after conquering it  However  some academics favour a theory that emphasises the diffusion of culture from overseas as opposed to a military colonisation  15  Finds such as Clonycavan Man are given as evidence for this theory  Late antiquity and early medieval times The earliest written records of Ireland come from classical Greco Roman geographers  Ptolemy in his Almagest refers to Ireland as Mikra Brettania  Lesser Britain   in contrast to the larger island  which he called Megale Brettania  Great Britain   16  In his later work  Geography  Ptolemy refers to Ireland as Iwernia and to Great Britain as Albion  These  new  names were likely to have been the Celtic names for the islands at the time  The earlier names  in contrast  were likely to have been coined before direct contact with local peoples were made  17  The Romans would later refer to Ireland by this name too in its Latinised form  Hibernia  18  or Scotia  19  Ptolemy records sixteen tribes inhabiting every part of Ireland in 100 AD  20  The relationship between the Roman Empire and the tribes of ancient Ireland is unclear  However  a number of finds of Roman coins have been found  for example at New Grange  21  Ireland continued as a patchwork of rival tribes but  beginning in the 7th century AD  a concept of national kingship gradually became articulated through the concept of a High King of Ireland  Medieval Irish literature portrays an almost unbroken sequence of High Kings stretching back thousands of years but modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the 8th century to justify the status of powerful political groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past  22  The High King was said to preside over the patchwork of provincial kingdoms that together formed Ireland  Each of these kingdoms had their own kings but were at least nominally subject to the High King  The High King was drawn from the ranks of the provincial kings and ruled also the royal kingdom of Meath  with a ceremonial capital at the Hill of Tara  The concept only became a political reality in the Viking Age and even then was not a consistent one  23  However  Ireland did have a unifying rule of law  the early written judicial system  the Brehon Laws  administered by a professional class of jurists known as the brehons  24  The Chronicle of Ireland records that in 431 AD Bishop Palladius arrived in Ireland on a mission from Pope Celestine I to minister to the Irish  already believing in Christ   25  The same chronicle records that Saint Patrick  Ireland s best known patron saint  arrived the following year  There is continued debate over the missions of Palladius and Patrick but the consensus is that they both took place 26  and that the older druid tradition collapsed in the face of the new religion  27  Irish Christian scholars excelled in the study of Latin and Greek learning and Christian theology  In the monastic culture that followed the Christianisation of Ireland  Latin and Greek learning was preserved in Ireland during the Early Middle Ages in contrast to elsewhere in Europe  where the Dark Ages followed the decline of the Roman Empire  27  28  The arts of manuscript illumination  metalworking and sculpture flourished and produced treasures such as the Book of Kells  ornate jewellery and the many carved stone crosses 29  that still dot the island today  A mission founded in 563 on Iona by the Irish monk Saint Columba began a tradition of Irish missionary work that spread Christianity and learning to Scotland  England and the Frankish Empire on Continental Europe after the fall of Rome  30  These missions continued until the late Middle Ages  establishing monasteries and centres of learning  producing scholars such as Sedulius Scottus and Johannes Eriugena and exerting much influence in Europe  Norse Viking invasions Main article  History of Ireland  800 1169  From the 9th century  waves of Viking raiders plundered Irish monasteries and towns  31  These raids added to a pattern of raiding and endemic warfare that was already deep seated in Ireland  The Vikings also were involved in establishing most of the major coastal settlements in Ireland  Dublin  Limerick  Cork  Wexford  Waterford  and also Carlingford  Strangford  Annagassan  Arklow  Youghal  Lough Foyle and Lough Ree  32  Norman and English invasions Main articles  Norman invasion of Ireland and Tudor conquest of Ireland Remains of the 11th century Trim Castle in County Meath  the largest Norman castle in Ireland  On May 1  1169  an expedition of Cambro Norman knights with an army of about six hundred landed at Bannow Strand in present day County Wexford  It was led by Richard de Clare  called Strongbow due to his prowess as an archer  33  The invasion  which coincided with a period of renewed Norman expansion  was at the invitation of Dermot Mac Murrough  the king of Leinster  34  In 1166  Mac Murrough had fled to Anjou  France following a war involving Tighearn n Ua Ruairc  of Breifne  and sought the assistance of the Angevin king  Henry II  in recapturing his kingdom  In 1171  Henry arrived in Ireland in order to review the general progress of the expedition  He wanted to re exert royal authority over the invasion which was expanding beyond his control  Henry successfully re imposed his authority over Strongbow and the Cambro Norman warlords and persuaded many of the Irish kings to accept him as their overlord  an arrangement confirmed in the 1175 Treaty of Windsor  The invasion was legitimised by the provisions of the Papal Bull Laudabiliter  issued by Adrian IV in 1155  The bull encouraged Henry to take control in Ireland in order to oversee the financial and administrative reorganisation of the Irish Church and its integration into the Roman Church system  35  Some restructuring had already begun at the ecclesiastical level following the Synod of Kells in 1152  36  There has been significant controversy regarding authenticity of Laudabiliter  37  and there is no general agreement as to whether the bull was genuine or a forgery  38  39  In 1172  the new pope  Alexander III  further encouraged Henry to advance the integration of the Irish Church with Rome  Henry was authorised to impose a tithe of one penny per hearth as an annual contribution  This church levy  called Peter s Pence  is still extant in Ireland as a voluntary donation  In turn  Henry accepted the title of Lord of Ireland which Henry conferred on his younger son  John Lackland  in 1185  This defined the Irish state as the Lordship of Ireland  When Henry s successor died unexpectedly in 1199  John inherited the crown of England and retained the Lordship of Ireland  Irish soldiers  1521   by Albrecht D rer  Over the century that followed  Norman feudal law gradually replaced the Gaelic Brehon Law so that by the late 13th century the Norman Irish had established a feudal system throughout much of Ireland  Norman settlements were characterised by the establishment of baronies  manors  towns and the seeds of the modern county system  A version of the Magna Carta  the Great Charter of Ireland   substituting Dublin for London and Irish Church for Church of England  was published in 1216 and the Parliament of Ireland was founded in 1297  However  from the mid 14th century  after the Black Death  Norman settlements in Ireland went into a period of decline  The Norman rulers and the Gaelic Irish elites intermarried and the areas under Norman rule became Gaelicised  In some parts  a hybrid Hiberno Norman culture emerged  In response  the Irish parliament passed the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1367  These were a set of laws designed to prevent the assimilation of the Normans into Irish society by requiring English subjects in Ireland to speak English  follow English customs and abide by English law  40  However  by the end of the 15th century central English authority in Ireland had all but disappeared and a renewed Irish culture and language  albeit with Norman influences  was dominant again  English Crown control remained relatively unshaken in an amorphous foothold around Dublin known as The Pale and under the provisions of Poynings  Law of 1494  the Irish Parliamentary legislation was subject to the approval of the English Parliament  Kingdom of Ireland A scene from The Image of Irelande  1581  showing a chieftain at a feast  The title of King of Ireland was re created in 1542 by Henry VIII  then King of England  of the Tudor dynasty  English rule of law was reinforced and expanded in Ireland during the latter part of the 16th century leading to the Tudor conquest of Ireland  A near complete conquest was achieved by the turn of the 17th century  following the Nine Years  War and the Flight of the Earls  This control was further consolidated during the wars and conflicts of the 17th century  which witnessed English and Scottish colonisation in the Plantations of Ireland  the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and the Williamite War  Irish losses during the Wars of the three Kingdoms  which  in Ireland  included the Irish Confederacy and the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland  are estimated to include 20 000 battlefield casualties  200 000 civilians are estimated to have died as a result of a combination of war related famine  displacement  guerilla activity and pestilence over the duration of the war  A further 50 000 Note 2  were sent to slavery in the West Indies  Some historians estimate that as much as half of the pre war population of Ireland may have died as a result of the conflict  43  The religious struggles of the 17th century left a deep sectarian division in Ireland  Religious allegiance now determined the perception in law of loyalty to the Irish King and Parliament  After the passing of the Test Act 1672  and with the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of William and Mary over the Jacobites  Roman Catholics and nonconforming Protestant Dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the Irish Parliament  Under the emerging penal laws Irish Roman Catholics and Dissenters were increasingly deprived of various and sundry civil rights even to the ownership of hereditary property  Additional regressive punitive legislation followed 1703  1709 and 1728  This completed a comprehensive systemic effort to materially disadvantage Roman Catholics and Protestant Dissenters  while enriching a new ruling class of Anglican conformists  44  The new Anglo Irish ruling class became known as the Protestant Ascendancy  Half hanging of suspected United Irishmen  An extraordinary climatic shock known as the  Great Frost  struck Ireland and the rest of Europe between December 1739 and September 1741  after a decade of relatively mild winters  The winters destroyed stored crops of potatoes and other staples and the poor summers severely damaged harvests  45  This resulted in the famine of 1740  An estimated 250 000 people  about one in eight of the population  died from the ensuing pestilence and disease  46  The Irish government halted export of corn and kept the army in quarters but did little more  46  47  Local gentry and charitable organisations provided relief but could do little to prevent the ensuing mortality  46  47  In the aftermath of the famine  an increase in industrial production and a surge in trade brought a succession of construction booms  The population soared in the latter part of this century and the architectural legacy of Georgian Ireland was built  In 1782  Poynings  Law was repealed  giving Ireland virtual legislative independence from Great Britain for the first time since the Norman invasion  citation needed  The British government  however  still retained the right to nominate the government of Ireland without the consent of the Irish parliament  In 1798  members of the Protestant Dissenter tradition  mainly Presbyterian  made common cause with Roman Catholics in a republican rebellion inspired and led by the Society of United Irishmen  with the aim of creating an independent Ireland  Despite assistance from France the rebellion was put down by British and Irish government and yeomanry forces  In 1800  the British and Irish parliaments both passed Acts of Union that  with effect from 1 January 1801  merged the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain to create a United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland  48  Union with Great Britain The passage of the Act in the Irish Parliament was ultimately achieved with substantial majorities  having failed on the first attempt in 1799  According to contemporary documents and historical analysis  this was achieved through a considerable degree of bribery  with funding provided by the British Secret Service Office  and the awarding of peerages  places and honours to secure votes  48  Thus  Ireland became part of an extended United Kingdom  ruled directly by a united parliament at Westminster in London  Emigrants Leave Ireland engraving by Henry Doyle depicting the emigration to America following the Great Famine in Ireland  The Great Famine of the 1840s caused the deaths of one million Irish people and over a million more emigrated to escape it  49  By the end of the decade  half of all immigration to the United States was from Ireland  citation needed  Mass emigration became deeply entrenched and the population continued to decline until the mid 20th century  Immediately prior to the famine the population was recorded as 8 2 million by the 1841 census  50  The population has never returned to this level since  51  The population continued to fall until 1961 and it was not until the 2006 census that the last county of Ireland  County Leitrim  to record a rise in population since 1841 did so  citation needed  The 19th and early 20th centuries saw the rise of modern Irish nationalism  primarily among the Roman Catholic population  The pre eminent Irish political figure after the Union was Daniel O Connell  He was elected as Member of Parliament for Ennis in a surprise result and despite being unable to take his seat as a Roman Catholic  O Connell spearheaded a vigorous campaign that was taken up by the Prime Minister  the Irish born soldier and statesman  the Duke of Wellington  Steering the Catholic Relief Bill through Parliament  aided by future prime minister Robert Peel  Wellington prevailed upon a reluctant George IV to sign the Bill and proclaim it into law  George s father had opposed the plan of the earlier Prime Minister  Pitt the Younger  to introduce such a bill following the Union of 1801  fearing Catholic Emancipation to be in conflict with the Act of Settlement 1701  A subsequent campaign  led by O Connell  for the repeal of the Act of Union failed  Later in the century  Charles Stewart Parnell and others campaigned for autonomy within the Union  or  Home Rule   Unionists  especially those located in Ulster  were strongly opposed to Home Rule  which they thought would be dominated by Catholic interests  52  After several attempts to pass a Home Rule bill through parliament  it looked certain that one would finally pass in 1914  To prevent this from happening  the Ulster Volunteers were formed in 1913 under the leadership of Edward Carson  53  Their formation was followed in 1914 by the establishment of the Irish Volunteers  whose aim was to ensure that the Home Rule Bill was passed  The Act was passed but with the  temporary  exclusion of the six counties of Ulster that would become Northern Ireland  Before it could be implemented  however  the Act was suspended for the duration of the First World War  The Irish Volunteers split into two groups  The majority  approximately 175 000 in number  under John Redmond  took the name National Volunteers and supported Irish involvement in the war  A minority  approximately 13 000  retained the Irish Volunteers name  and opposed Ireland s involvement in the war  53  Sackville Street  now O Connell Street   Dublin  after the 1916 Easter Rising The failed Easter Rising of 1916 was carried out by the latter group in alliance with a smaller socialist militia  the Irish Citizen Army  The British response  executing fifteen leaders of the Rising over a period of ten days and imprisoning or interning more than a thousand people  turned the mood of the country in favour of the rebels  The pro independence republican party  Sinn F in  received overwhelming endorsement in the general election of 1918  and in 1919 proclaimed an Irish Republic  setting up its own parliament  D il  ireann  and government  British authorities attempted to extinguish this challenge  sparking a guerilla war from 1919 to July 1921 which ended in a truce  54  In 1921  the Anglo Irish Treaty was concluded between the British Government and representatives of the First D il  It gave all of Ireland complete independence in their home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy  However  an oath of allegiance to the British Crown had to be exercised  and Northern Ireland was given an opt out clause  which it exercised immediately as expected  55  Disagreements over these provisions led to a split in the nationalist movement and a subsequent civil war between the new government of the Irish Free State and those opposed to the treaty  led by  amon de Valera  The civil war officially ended in May 1923 when de Valera issued a cease fire order  56  Partition Independent Ireland Main article  History of the Republic of Ireland Annotated page from the Anglo Irish Treaty that established the Irish Free State and independence for 26 out of 32 Irish counties  During its first decade the newly formed Irish Free State was governed by the victors of the civil war  When de Valera achieved power  he took advantage of the Statute of Westminster and political circumstances to build upon inroads to greater sovereignty made by the previous government  The oath was abolished and in 1937 a new constitution was adopted  54  This completed a process of gradual separation from the British Empire that governments had pursued since independence  However  it was not until 1949 that the state was declared  officially  to be the Republic of Ireland  The state was neutral during World War II  but offered clandestine assistance to the Allies  particularly in the potential defence of Northern Ireland  Despite being neutral  approximately 50 000 57  volunteers from independent Ireland joined the British forces during the war  four being awarded Victoria Crosses  German Intelligence was also active in Ireland  with both the Abwehr    apve      German for Defence  the German military intelligence service  and the SD  the Sicherheitsdienst  English  Security Service  the intelligence service of the SS  sending agents there  58  German intelligence operations effectively ended in September 1941 when An Garda S och na made arrests on the basis of surveillance carried out on the key diplomatic legations in Ireland  including the United States  To the authorities counterintelligence was more than mere luxury  but a fundamental line of defence  With a regular army of only slightly over seven thousand men at the start of the war  and with limited supplies of modern weapons  the state would have had great difficulty in defending itself from invasion from either side of the conflict  58  59  Large scale emigration marked the 1950s and 1980s  but beginning in 1987 the economy improved  and the 1990s saw the beginning of substantial economic growth  This period of growth became known as the Celtic Tiger  60  The Republic s real GDP grew by an average of 9 6  per annum between 1995 and 1999 61  and in 2000 Ireland was the sixth richest country in the world in terms of GDP per capita  62  Social changes followed quickly on the heels of economic prosperity ranging from the  modernisation  of the St  Patrick s Day parade in Dublin to the decline in authority of the Catholic Church  The financial crisis of 2008 2010 dramatically ended this period of boom  GDP fell by 3  in 2008 and by 7 1  in 2009  the worst year since records began  although earnings by foreign owned businesses continued to grow   63  Northern Ireland Main article  History of Northern Ireland Northern Ireland was created as a division of the United Kingdom by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 and until 1972 it was a self governing jurisdiction within the United Kingdom with its own parliament and prime minister  Northern Ireland  as part of the United Kingdom  was not neutral during the Second World War and Belfast suffered four bombing raids in 1941  Conscription was not extended to Northern Ireland and roughly an equal number volunteered from Northern Ireland as volunteered from the south  One  James Joseph Magennis  received the Victoria Cross for valour  Edward Carson signing the Solemn League and Covenant in 1912  declaring opposition to Home Rule  using all means which may be found necessary   Although Northern Ireland was largely spared the strife of the civil war  in decades that followed partition there were sporadic episodes of inter communal violence  Nationalists  mainly Roman Catholic  wanted to unite Ireland as an independent republic  whereas unionists  mainly Protestant  wanted Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom  The Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland voted largely along sectarian lines  meaning that the Government of Northern Ireland  elected by  first past the post  from 1929  was controlled by the Ulster Unionist Party  Over time  the minority Catholic community felt increasingly alienated with further disaffection fueled by practices such as gerrymandering and discrimination in housing and employment  64  65  66  In the late 1960s  nationalist grievances were aired publicly in mass civil rights protests  which were often confronted by loyalist counter protests  67  The government s reaction to confrontations was seen to be one sided and heavy handed in favour of unionists  Law and order broke down as unrest and inter communal violence increased  68  The Northern Ireland government requested the British Army to aid the police  who were exhausted after several nights of serious rioting  In 1969  the paramilitary Provisional IRA  which favoured the creation of a united Ireland  emerged from a split in the Irish Republican Army and began a campaign against what it called the  British occupation of the six counties   Other groups  on both the unionist side and the nationalist side  participated in violence and a period known as the Troubles began  Over 3 600 deaths resulted over the subsequent three decades of conflict  69  Owing to the civil unrest during the Troubles  the British government suspended home rule in 1972 and imposed direct rule  There were several ultimately unsuccessful attempts to end the Troubles politically  such as the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973  In 1998  following a ceasefire by the Provisional IRA and multi party talks  the Belfast Agreement was concluded as a treaty between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland  annexing the text agreed in the multi party talks  The substance of the Agreement  often referred to as the Good Friday Agreement  was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland  The Agreement restored self government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power sharing in a regional Executive drawn from the major parties in a new Northern Ireland Assembly  with entrenched protections for the two main communities  The Executive is jointly headed by a First Minister and deputy First Minister drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties  Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994 and in 2005 the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an independent commission supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations  70  The Assembly and power sharing Executive were suspended several times but were restored again in 2007  In that year the British government officially ended its military support of the police in Northern Ireland  Operation Banner  and began withdrawing troops  Governance Further information  for the political

that county  Ireland is occupied by two political entities  The Republic of Ireland  formed as the Irish Free State on the 6 December 1922   officially Ireland   a sovereign state that covers five sixths of the island  Its capital is Dublin  Northern Ireland  established on the 3 May 1921  is a part of the United Kingdom that covers the remaining sixth  Its capital is Belfast  Traditionally  Ireland is subdivided into four provinces  Connacht  west   Leinster  east   Munster  south   and Ulster  north   In a system that developed between the 13th and 17th centuries  71  Ireland has thirty two traditional counties  Twenty six of the counties are in the Republic of Ireland and six counties are in Northern Ireland  The six counties that constitute Northern Ireland are all in the province of Ulster  which has nine counties in total   As such  Ulster is often used as a synonym for Northern Ireland  although the two are not coterminous  In the Republic of Ireland counties form the basis of the system of local government  Counties Dublin  Cork  Limerick  Galway  Waterford and Tipperary have been broken up into smaller administrative areas  However  they are still treated as counties for cultural and some official purposes  for example post and by the Ordnance Survey Ireland  Counties in Northern Ireland are no longer used for local governmental purposes  72  but  as in the Republic  their traditional boundaries are still used for informal purposes such as sports leagues and in cultural or tourism contexts  73  City status in Ireland is decided by legislative or royal

island of Ireland continues to act as a single entity in a number of areas that transcend governmental agencies  The two jurisdictions share transport  telecommunications  energy and water systems  With a few notable exceptions  the island is the main organisational unit for major religious  cultural and sporting organisations  The island fields a single international team in most sports  for example  and March 17 is celebrated throughout Ireland as the traditional Irish holiday of St  Patrick s Day  One notable exception to this is Association football  although both associations continued to field international teams under the name  Ireland  until the 1950s  An all Ireland club competition for soccer  the Setanta Cup  was created in 2005  The 1998 Belfast Agreement provides

and the Northern Ireland Executive can formulate all island policies in twelve  areas of co operation  such as agriculture  the environment and transport  Six of these policy areas have associated all island  implementation bodies   For example  food safety is managed by the Food Safety Promotion Board and Tourism Ireland markets the island as a whole  Three major political parties  Sinn F in  the Irish Green Party and  most recently  Fianna F il  are organised on an all island basis  However  only the former two of these have contested elections and have held legislative seats in both jurisdictions  Despite the two jurisdictions using two distinct currencies  the euro and pound sterling   a growing amount of commercial activity is carried out on an all island basis  This has in part been facilitated by the two jurisdictions  shared membership of the European Union  Calls for the creation of an  all island economy  have been made from members of the business community and policymakers so as to benefit from economies of scale and boost competitiveness  75  One area in which the island already operates largely as a single market is electricity 76  and there are plans for the creation of an all island gas market  77  Support for such initiatives comes from the Irish government and nationalist parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly  78  Geography Main articles  Geography of Ireland and Geology of Ireland See also  Climate of Ireland Physical features of Ireland  The island of Ireland is located in the north west of Europe  between latitudes 51  and 56  N  and longitudes 11  and 5  W  It is separated from the neighbouring island of Great Britain by the Irish Sea and the North Channel  which has a width of 23 kilometres  14 mi  79  at its narrowest point  To the west is the northern Atlantic Ocean and to the south is the Celtic Sea  which lies between Ireland and Brittany  in France  Ireland and Great Britain  together with nearby islands  are known collectively as the British Isles  As the term British Isles is controversial in relation to Ireland  the alternate term  Ireland and Britain   or  Britain and Ireland   is often used as a neutral term for the islands  A ring of coastal mountains surround low plains at the centre of the island  The highest of these is Carrauntoohil  Irish  Corr n Tuathail  in County Kerry  which rises to 1 038 m  3 406 ft  above sea level  80  The most arable land lies in the province of Leinster  81  Western areas can be mountainous and rocky with green panoramic vistas  The River Shannon  the island s longest river at 386 km  240 mi  long  rises in County Cavan in the north west and flows 113 kilometres  70 mi  to Limerick city in the mid west  82  The island s lush vegetation  a product of its mild climate and frequent rainfall  earns it the sobriquet the Emerald Isle  Overall  Ireland has a mild but changeable oceanic climate with few extremes  The climate is typically insular and is temperate avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas in the world at similar latitudes  83  This is a result of the moderating moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the South Western Atlantic  The rugged hills of Connemara  County Galway  Precipitation falls throughout the year but is light overall  particularly in the east  The west tends to be wetter on average and prone to Atlantic storms  especially in the late autumn and winter months  These occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas  as well as sometimes snow and hail  The regions of north County Galway and east County Mayo have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island  with lightening occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas  84 Munster  in the south  records the least snow whereas Ulster  in the north  records the most  Inland areas are warmer in summer and colder in winter  Usually around 40 days of the year are below freezing 0  C  32  F  at inland weather stations  compared to 10 days at coastal stations  Ireland is sometimes affected by heat waves  most recently in 1995  2003 and 2006  In common with the rest of Europe  Ireland experienced unusually cold weather during the winter of 2009 10  Temperatures fell as low as  17 2  C  1  F  in County Mayo on December 20 85  and up to a metre  3 ft  of snow in mountainous areas  Green pasture in County Down  with the Mountains of Mourne in the background  The island consists of varied geological provinces  In the far west  around County Galway and County Donegal  is a medium to high grade metamorphic and igneous complex of Caledonide affinity  similar to the Scottish Highlands  Across southeast Ulster and extending southwest to Longford and south to Navan is a province of Ordovician and Silurian rocks  with similarities to the Southern Uplands province of Scotland  Further south  along the County Wexford coastline  is an area of granite intrusives into more Ordovician and Silurian rocks  like that found in Wales  86  87  In the southwest  around Bantry Bay and the mountains of Macgillicuddy s Reeks  is an area of substantially deformed  but only lightly metamorphosed  Devonian aged rocks  88  This partial ring of  hard rock  geology is covered by a blanket of Carboniferous limestone over the centre of the country  giving rise to a comparatively fertile and lush landscape  The west coast district of the Burren around Lisdoonvarna has well developed karst features  89  Significant stratiform lead zinc mineralisation is found in the limestones around Silvermines and Tynagh  Hydrocarbon exploration is ongoing following the first major find at the Kinsale Head gas field off Cork in the mid 1970s  90  91  More recently  in 1999  economically significant finds of natural gas were made in the Corrib Gas Field off the County Mayo coast  This has increased activity off the west coast in parallel with the  West of Shetland  step out development from the North Sea hydrocarbon province  The Helvick oil field  estimated to contain over 28 million barrels  4 500 000 m3  of oil  is another recent discovery  92  Places of interest Main article  Tourist destinations in Ireland There are three World Heritage Sites on the island  the Br  na Boinne  Skellig Michael and the Giant s Causeway  93  A number of other places are on the tentative list  for example the Burren and Mount Stewart  94  Some of the most visited sites in Ireland include Bunratty Castle  the Rock of Cashel  the Cliffs of Moher  Holy Cross Abbey and Blarney Castle  95  Historically important monastic sites include Glendalough and Clonmacnoise  which are maintained as national monuments in the Republic of Ireland  96  Dublin is the most heavily touristed region 95  and home to several of the most popular attractions such as the Guinness Storehouse and Book of Kells  95  The west and south west  which includes the Lakes of Killarney and the Dingle peninsula in County Kerry and Connemara and the Aran Islands in County Galway  are also popular tourist destinations  95 Achill Island lies off the coast of County Mayo and is Ireland s largest island  It is a popular tourist destination for surfing and contains 5 Blue Flag beaches and Croaghaun one of the worlds highest sea cliffs  Stately homes  built during the 17th  18th and 19th centuries in Palladian  Neoclassical and neo Gothic styles  such as  Castle Ward  Castletown House  Bantry House  are also of interest to tourists  Some have been converted into hotels  such as Ashford Castle  Castle Leslie and Dromoland Castle  World Heritage Sites in Ireland Giant s CausewayCounty Antrim Skellig MichaelCounty Kerry Br  na B inneCounty Meath Flora and fauna Main articles  Fauna of Ireland  Flora of Ireland  and Trees of Britain and Ireland The red deer  Cervus elaphus  Ireland s largest wild mammal in Killarney National Park  As Ireland was isolated from mainland Europe by rising sea levels after the ice age  it has less diverse animal and plant species than either Great Britain or mainland Europe  There are 55 mammal species in Ireland and of them only 26 land mammal species are considered native to Ireland  97  Some species  such as  the red fox  hedgehog and badger  are very common  whereas others  like the Irish hare  red deer and pine marten are less so  Aquatic wildlife  such as species of turtle  shark  whale  and dolphin  are common off the coast  About 400 species of birds have been recorded in Ireland  Many of these are migratory  including the Barn Swallow  Most of Ireland s bird species come from Iceland  Greenland and Africa  Several different habitat types are found in Ireland  including farmland  open woodland  temperate broadleaf and mixed forests  conifer plantations  peat bogs and a variety of coastal habitats  However  agriculture drives current land use patterns in Ireland  limiting natural habitat preserves  98  particularly for larger wild mammals with greater territorial needs  With no top predator in Ireland  populations of animals  such as semi wild deer  that cannot be controlled by smaller predators  such as the fox  are controlled by annual culling  There are no snakes in Ireland and only one reptile  the common lizard  is native to the island  Extinct species include the Irish elk  the great auk and the wolf  Some previously extinct birds  such as  the Golden Eagle  have recently been reintroduced after decades of extirpation  Until medieval times Ireland was heavily forested with oak  pine and birch  Forests today cover about 12 6  of Ireland  99  of which 4 450 km  or one million acres is owned by Coillte  the Republic s forestry service  100  The Republic lies in 42nd place  out of 55  in a list of the most forested countries in Europe  101  Much of the land is now covered with pasture and there are many species of wild flower  Gorse  Ulex europaeus   a wild furze  is commonly found growing in the uplands and ferns are plentiful in the more moist regions  especially in the western parts  It is home to hundreds of plant species  some of them unique to the island  and has been  invaded  by some grasses  such as Spartina anglica  102  Furze  Ulex europaeus  The algal and seaweed flora is that of the cold temperate variety  The total number of species is 574  103  and is distributed as follows  264 Rhodophyta  red algae  152 Phaeophyceae  brown algae including kelps  114 Chloropyta  green algae  31 Cyanophyta  Blue green algae  Rarer species include  103  Itonoa marginifera  J Agardh  Masuda  amp  Guiry Schmitzia hiscockiana Maggs  amp  Guiry Gelidiella calcicola Maggs  amp  Guiry Gelidium maggsiae Rico  amp  Guiry Halymenia latifolia P L Crouan  amp  H M Crouan ex K tzing  The island has been invaded by some algae  some of which are now well established  For example  104  Asparagopsis armara Harvey  which originated in Australia and was first recorded by M  De Valera in 1939 Colpomenia peregrina Sauvageau  which is now locally abundant and first recorded in the 1930s Sargassum muticum  Yendo  Fensholt  now well established in a number of localities on the south  west  and north east coasts Codium fragile ssp  fragile  formerly reported as ssp  tomentosum   now well established  Codium fragile ssp  atlanticum has recently been established to be native  although for many years it was regarded as an alien species  Because of its mild climate  many species  including sub tropical species such as palm trees  are grown in Ireland  Phytogeographically  Ireland belongs to the Atlantic European province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom  The island itself can be subdivided into two ecoregions  the Celtic broadleaf forests and North Atlantic moist mixed forests  Impact of agriculture Rolling green pastures near Bantry  County Cork  The long history of agricultural production  coupled with modern intensive agricultural methods such as pesticide and fertiliser use and runoff from contaminants into streams  rivers and lakes  impact the natural fresh water ecosystems and have placed pressure on biodiversity in Ireland  105  106  A land of green fields for crop cultivation and cattle rearing limits the space available for the establishment of native wild species  Hedgerows  however  traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries  act as a refuge for native wild flora  This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island  Subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy  which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments  are undergoing reforms  The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices  for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides  but recent reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements  107  Forest covers about 12 6  of the country  most of it designated for commercial production  98  Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non native species  which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates  Remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the island  in particular in the Killarney National Park  Natural areas require fencing to prevent over grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas  Grazing in this manner is one of the main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country  108  Economy Main articles  Economic history of Ireland  Economy of the Republic of Ireland  and Economy of Northern Ireland Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution  One reason given why Ireland did not experience an industrial revolution is because of the scarcity of coal and iron  109  resources that facilitate an industrial revolution  However  there were other countries that lacked these resources but nonetheless industrialised  so there may be other reasons why Ireland did not industrialise  110  Nineteenth century explanations for why Ireland did not industrialise did not blame the absence of natural resources but that  The fault is not in the country  but in ourselves  the absence of successful enterprise is owing to the fact  that we do not know how to succeed     we want special industrial knowledge   111  Some historians today point to the sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England  They point out that iron and coal prices in Ireland were as cheap as they were in parts of England outside of the mining centres   and a little cheaper in some parts   and that  on the eve of union with Great Britain  Ireland was industrialising  particularly the linen industry   112  It may be that  by merging the two economies suddenly  Ireland did not industrialise  but  instead became a supplier of food   and capital   to the  mainland    113  Mass emigration followed in the wake of the Great Famine in the mid 19th century and continued until the 1980s  114  However  the Irish economic experience reversed dramatically during the course of the 1990s  which saw the beginning of unprecedented economic growth in the Republic of Ireland  in a phenomenon known as the  Celtic Tiger   115  and peace being restored in Northern Ireland  In 2005 the Republic of Ireland was ranked the best place to live in the world according to a  quality of life  assessment by The Economist magazine  116  The Republic of Ireland joined the euro in 1999  while Northern Ireland remained with the pound sterling  Both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland entered recession in 2008 117  118  and  in 2009  the unemployment rate for the Republic of Ireland was 12 5  119  due to the 2008 2010 Irish financial crisis  Transport Main articles  Transport in Ireland and Roads in Ireland Aer Lingus Airbus

 of goods trade with Britain annually  while ports in the Republic of Ireland handle 7 6 Mt  8 4 million short tons   Ferry connections between Ireland and Great Britain via the Irish Sea include routes from Dublin to Holyhead  Birkenhead  and Douglas  Isle of Man  Belfast to Stranraer  Birkenhead and Douglas  Isle of Man  Larne to Cairnryan and Troon  Cork to Swansea and Rosslare to Fishguard and Pembroke  There are also ferry connections to France  from Rosslare to Roscoff and Cherbourg  and also from Cork to Roscoff  Several  mainly hypothetical  plans to build an  Irish Sea tunnel  have been proposed  The first serious proposal was made in 1897  which was for a tunnel between Ireland and Scotland crossing the North Channel  Most recently  in 2004  the Irish Academy of Engineering envisaged a  Tusker Tunnel  between the ports of Rosslare and Fishguard  125  126  In 1997 a British engineering firm  Symonds  proposed a rail tunnel from Dublin to Holyhead  Either of the two most recent proposals  at 80 km  50 mi   would be by far the longest tunnel in the world and would cost an estimated  20bn  Ireland s intercity railways  important water ports  airports  with regularly scheduled non domestic flights  and motorways  including some motorways nearing completion  The railway network in Ireland was developed by various private companies during the 19th century  with some receiving government funding in the late 19th century  The network reached its greatest extent by 1920  A broad gauge of 1 600mm  5 ft 3in  127  was agreed as the standard the island  although there were also hundreds of kilometres of 914mm  3 ft  narrow gauge railways  127  Long distance passenger trains in the Republic of Ireland are managed by Iarnr d  ireann and connect most major towns and cities  In Northern Ireland all rail services are provided by Northern Ireland Railways  Ireland has one of the largest dedicated freight railways in Europe  operated by Bord na M na totalling nearly 1 400 kilometres  870 mi   128  In Dublin  two local rail networks provide transport in the city and its immediate vicinity  The Dublin Area Rapid Transit  DART  links the city centre with coastal suburbs  A new light rail system  the Luas  opened in 2004 and transports passengers to the central and western suburbs  Several more Luas lines are planned as well as a Dublin metro system  The DART is run by Iarnr d  ireann and the Luas is run by Veolia under franchise from the Railway Procurement Agency  Under the Irish government s Transport 21 plan  the Cork to Midleton rail link was reopened in 2009  The re opening of the Navan Clonsilla rail link and the Western Rail Corridor are amongst future projects as part of the same plan  129  Public transport services in Northern Ireland are sparse in comparison with those of the rest of Ireland or Great Britain  A large railway network was severely curtailed in the 1950s and 1960s  130  Current services includes suburban routes to Larne  Newry and Bangor  as well as services to Derry  There is also a branch from Coleraine to Portrush  131  Motorists in Ireland drive on the left  There is an extensive road network and a developing motorway network fanning out from Dublin and Belfast in particular  Historically  land owners developed most roads and later Turnpike Trusts collected tolls so that as early as 1800 Ireland had a 16 100 kilometres  10 000 mi  road network  132  In recent years  the Irish Government launched a new transport plan that is the largest investment project ever in Ireland s transport system  investing  34 billion from 2006 until 2015  Work on a number of road projects has already commenced and a number of objectives have been completed  133  Ireland s first mail coach services were contracted with the government by John Anderson with William Bourne in 1791 who also paid to improve the condition of the roads  134  The system of mail coaches  carriages and  bians  was further developed by Charles Bianconi  based in Clonmel  from 1815 as a fore runner of the modern Irish public transportation system  135  Today the main bus companies are Bus  ireann in the Republic and Ulsterbus in Northern Ireland  both of which offer extensive passenger service in all parts of the island  Dublin Bus specifically serves the greater Dublin area and Metro operates services within the greater Belfast area  Signposts and speed limits in the Republic of Ireland are shown in kilometres per hour  with speed limits having changed in 2005  Distance and speed limit signs in Northern Ireland use imperial units in common with the rest of United Kingdom  Electricity networks For much of their existence electricity networks in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were entirely separate  Both networks were designed and constructed independently post partition  However  as a result of changes over recent years they are now connected with three interlinks 136  and also connected through Great Britain to mainland Europe  The situation in Northern Ireland is complicated by the issue of private companies not supplying Northern Ireland Electricity  NIE  with enough power  In the Republic of Ireland  the ESB has failed to modernise its power stations and the availability of power plants has recently averaged only 66   one of the worst such rates in Western Europe  EirGrid is building a HVDC transmission line between Ireland and Great Britain with a capacity of 500 MW  about 10  of Ireland s peak demand  137  Ringsend power station in Dublin Similar to electricity  the natural gas distribution network is also now all island  with a pipeline linking Gormanston  County Meath  and Ballyclare  County Antrim  138  Most of Ireland s gas comes through interconnectors between Twynholm in Scotland and Ballylumford  County Antrim and Loughshinny  County Dublin  A decreasing supply is coming from the Kinsale gas field off the County Cork coast 139  140  and the Corrib Gas Field off the coast of County Mayo has yet to come on line  The County Mayo field is facing some localised opposition over a controversial decision to refine the gas onshore  There have been recent efforts in Ireland to use renewable energy such as wind power  Large wind farms are being constructed in coastal counties such as Cork  Donegal  Mayo and Antrim  The construction of wind farms has in some cases been delayed by opposition from local communities  some of whom consider the wind turbines to be unsightly  The Republic of Ireland is also hindered by an ageing network that was not designed to handle the varying availability of power that comes from wind farms  The ESB s Turlough Hill facility is the only power storage facility in the state  141  Demographics Main articles  Irish people  Demographics of the Republic of Ireland  and Demography of Northern Ireland The population of Ireland since 1603 showing the consequence of the Great Famine  1845 9   Note  figures before 1841 are contemporary estimates   People have lived in Ireland for over 9 000 years  although only a limited amount is known about the palaeolithic  neolithic and Bronze Age inhabitants of the island  Early historical and genealogical records note the existence of dozens of different peoples that may or may not be mythological  for example the Cruithne  Attacotti  Conmaicne  E ganachta   rainn  and Soghain  to name but a few  Over the past 1000 years or so  Vikings  Normans  Scots and English have all added to the Gaelic population and have had significant influences on Irish Culture  Estimate

about 53  of Northern Ireland   143  The largest is the Anglican Church of Ireland  The Muslim community is growing in Ireland  mostly through increased immigration  The island has a small Jewish community  About 4  of the Republic s population 142  and about 14  of the Northern Ireland population 143  describe themselves as of no religion  In a 2010 survey conducted on behalf of the Irish Times  32  of respondents said they went to a religious service more than once a week  citation needed  The population of Ireland rose rapidly from the 16th century until the mid 19th century  but a devastating famine in the 1840s caused one million deaths and forced over one million more to emigrate in its immediate wake  Over the following century the population was reduced by over half  at a time when the general trend in European countries was for populations to rise by an average of three fold  Population density map of Ireland 2002 showing the heavily weighted eastern seaboard and Ulster  Emigration from Ireland over this period contributed to the populations of England  the United States  Canada and Australia where today a large Irish diaspora lives  Today 4 3 million Canadians  or 14  of her population  are of Irish descent  144  A total of 36 million Americans claim Irish ancestry   more than 12  of the total population and 20  of the white population  145 Massachusetts is the most Irish of US states with 23 8  of the population claiming Irish ancestry  The pattern of immigration over this period particularly devastated the western and southern sea boards  Prior to the Great Famine  the provinces of Connacht  Munster and Leinster were more or less evenly populated whereas Ulster was far less densely populated than the other three  Today  Ulster and Leinster  and in particular Dublin  have a far greater population density than Munster and Connacht  With growing prosperity since the last decade of the 20th century  Ireland became a place of immigration until the financial crisis that began in 2008  Since the European Union expanded to included Poland in 2004  Polish people have made up the largest number of immigrants  over 150 000  146  from Central Europe  There has also been significant immigration from Lithuania  the Czech Republic and Latvia  147  The Republic of Ireland in particular has seen large scale immigration  The 2006 census recorded that 420 000 foreign nationals  or about 10  of the population  lived in the Republic of Ireland  148 Chinese and Nigerians  along with people from other African countries  have accounted for a large proportion of the non European Union migrants to Ireland  Up to 50 000 eastern European migrant workers may have left Ireland since the end of 2008  149  Two main languages are spoken in Ireland  Irish and English and both languages have widely contributed to literature  Irish  now a minority but official language of the Republic of Ireland was the vernacular of the Irish people for over two thousand years and was probably introduced by some sort of proto Gaelic migration during the Iron age  possibly earlier  It began to be written down after Christianization in the 5th century and spread to Scotland and the Isle of Man where it evolved into the Scottish Gaelic and Manx languages respectively  It has a vast treasure of written texts from many centuries and is divided by linguists into Old Irish from the 6th to 10th century  Middle Irish from the 10th to 13th century and Early Modern Irish until the seventeenth century and evolved into the Modern Irish spoken today  It remained the dominant language of Ireland for most of those periods  having influences from Latin  Old Norse French and English  It declined under British Rule but remained the majority tongue until the early 19th century and since then has been a minority language although Revival efforts are continuing in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland  however Gaeltacht or Irish speaking areas are still seeing a decline in the language  It is a compulsory subject in the state education system and the Gaelscoil movement has seen many Irish medium schools established  English was first introduced to Ireland in the Norman invasion and was spoken by a few peasants and merchants brought over from England and was largely replaced by Irish before the Tudor Conquest of Ireland  It was introduced as the the official language with the Tudor and Cromwellian conquests and the Ulster plantations gave it a permanent foothold in Ulster and remained to Official and Upper class language elsewhere  the Irish speaking Cheiftains and Nobility having been deposed  Language shift during the 19th century has replaced Irish as the first language for a vast majority of the population  150  Less than 10  of the population of the Republic of Ireland today speak Irish regularly outside of the education system 151  and 38  of those over 15 years are classified as  Irish speakers   In Northern Ireland  English is the de facto official language but official recognition is afforded to both Irish and Ulster Scots  which is also spoken by a number of people south of the border  In recent decades  with the increase in immigration  many more languages have been introduced  particularly deriving from Asia and Eastern Europe  Culture Main articles  Culture of Ireland and Culture of Northern Ireland Ardboe High Cross  County Tyrone Ireland s culture comprises elements of the culture of ancient immigration and influences  such as Gaelic culture  and more recent Anglicisation and Americanisation as well as participation in a broader European culture  In broad terms  Ireland is regarded as one of the Celtic nations of Europe  which also includes Scotland  Wales  Cornwall  Isle of Mann and Brittany  This combination of cultural influences is visible in the intricate designs termed Irish interlace or Celtic knotwork  These can be seen in the ornamentation of medieval religious and secular works  The style is still popular today in jewellery and graphic art  152  as is the distinctive style of traditional Irish music and dance  and has become indicative of modern  Celtic  culture in general  Religion has played a significant role in the cultural life of the island since ancient times  and since the 17th century plantations  has been the focus of political identity and divisions on the island   Ireland s pre Christian heritage fused with the Celtic Church following the missions of Saint Patrick in the 5th century  The Hiberno Scottish missions  begun by the Irish monk Saint Columba  spread the Irish vision of Christianity to pagan England and the Frankish Empire  These missions brought written language to an illiterate population of Europe during the Dark Ages that followed the fall of Rome  earning Ireland the sobriquet   the island of saints and scholars   In more recent years  the Irish pubs have become outposts of Irish culture worldwide  The Republic of Ireland s national theatre is the Abbey Theatre founded in 1904 and the national Irish language theatre is An Taibhdhearc  established in 1928 in Galway  153  154  Playwrights such as Se n O Casey  Brian Friel  Sebastian Barry  Conor McPherson and Billy Roche are internationally renowned  155  Art Main articles  Music of Ireland  Irish dance  Languages of Ireland  Irish literature  Irish art  and Irish theatre Illustrated page from Book of Kells  There are a number of languages used in Ireland  Irish is the only language to have originated from within the island  Since the late 19th century  English has become the predominant first language having been a spoken language in Ireland since the Middle Ages  A large minority claim some ability to speak Irish today  although it is the first language only of a small percentage of the population  Under Constitution of Ireland  both languages have official status with Irish being the national and first official language  In Northern Ireland English is the dominant state language  whilst Irish and Ulster Scots are recognised minority languages  Ireland has made a large contribution to world literature in all its branches  particularly in the English language  Poetry in Irish is the oldest vernacular poetry in Europe  with the earliest examples dating from the 6th century  In English  Jonathan Swift  still often called the foremost satirist in the English language  was wildly popular in his day for works such as Gulliver s Travels and A Modest Proposal and Oscar Wilde is known most for his often quoted witticisms  In the 20th century  Ireland produced four winners of the Nobel Prize for Literature  George Bernard Shaw  William Butler Yeats  Samuel Beckett and Seamus Heaney  Although not a Nobel Prize winner  James Joyce is widely considered to be one of the most significant writers of the 20th century  Joyce s 1922 novel Ulysses is considered one of the most important works of Modernist literature and his life is celebrated annually on 16 June in Dublin as  Bloomsday   156  Modern Irish literature is often connected with its rural heritage 157  through writers such as John McGahern and poets such as Seamus Heaney  James Joyce one of the most significant writers of the 20th century  The Irish traditional music and dance has seen a recent surge in popularity  not least through the phenomenon of Riverdance  a theatrical performance of Irish traditional dancing  158  In the middle years of the 20th century  as Irish society was modernising  traditional music fell out of favour  especially in urban areas  159  During the 1960s  inspired by the American folk music movement  there was a revival of interest in Irish traditional music led by groups such as The Dubliners  The Chieftains  Emmet Spiceland  The Wolfe Tones  the Clancy Brothers  Sweeney s Men and individuals like Se n   Riada and Christy Moore  160  Groups and musicians including Horslips  Van Morrison and Thin Lizzy incorporated elements of Irish traditional music into contemporary rock music and  during the 1970s and 1980s  the distinction between traditional and rock musicians became blurred  with many individuals regularly crossing over between these styles of playing  This trend can be seen more recently in the work of artists like Enya  The Saw Doctors  The Corrs  Sin ad O Connor  Clannad  The Cranberries  Black 47 and The Pogues among others  During the 1990s a sub genre of folk metal emerged in Ireland that fused heavy metal music with Irish and Celtic music  The pioneers of this sub genre were Cruachan  Primordial  and Waylander  Some contemporary music groups stick closer to a  traditional  sound  including Altan  T ada  Dan   Dervish  L nasa  and Solas  Others incorporate multiple cultures in a fusion of styles  such as Afro Celt Sound System and K la  The theme is can also be seen among the Republic of Ireland s entries to the Eurovision Song Contest  where the Republic of Ireland is also the most successful country in the competition with seven wins  161  The earliest known Irish graphic art and sculpture are Neolithic carvings found at sites such as Newgrange 162  and is traced through Bronze age artefacts and the religious carvings and illuminated manuscripts of the medieval period  During the course of the 19th and 20th centuries  a strong tradition of painting emerged  including such figures as John Butler Yeats  William Orpen  Jack Yeats and Louis le Brocquy  Science Robert Boyle formulated Boyle s Law  The Irish philosopher and theologian Johannes Scotus Eriugena was considered one of the leading intellectuals of his early Middle Ages  Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton  an Anglo Irish explorer  was one of the principal figures of Antarctic exploration  He  along with his expedition  made the first ascent of Mount Erebus and the discovery of the approximate location of the South Magnetic Pole  Robert Boyle was a 17th century natural philosopher  chemist  physicist  inventor and early gentleman scientist  He is largely regarded one of the founders of modern chemistry and is best known for the formulation of Boyle s law  163  19th century physicist  John Tyndall  discovered the Tyndall effect  which explains why the sky is blue  Father Nicholas Joseph Callan  Professor of Natural Philosophy in Maynooth College  is best known for his invention of the induction coil  transformer and he discovered an early method of galvanisation in the 19th century  Other notable Irish physicists include Ernest Walton  winner of the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physics  With Sir John Douglas Cockcroft  he was the first to split the nucleus of the atom by artificial means and made contributions to the development of a new theory of wave equation  164  William Thomson  or Lord Kelvin  is the person whom the absolute temperature unit  the Kelvin  is named after  Sir Joseph Larmor  a physicist and mathematician  made innovations in the understanding of electricity  dynamics  thermodynamics and the electron theory of matter  His most influential work was Aether and Matter  a book on theoretical physics published in 1900  165  George Johnstone Stoney introduced the term electron in 1891  John Stewart Bell was the originator of Bell s Theorem and a paper concerning the discovery of the Bell Jackiw Adler anomaly and was nominated for a Nobel prize  163  Notable mathematicians include Sir William Rowan Hamilton  famous for work in classical mechanics and the invention of quaternions  Francis Ysidro Edgeworth s contribution of the Edgeworth Box remains influential in neo classical microeconomic theory to this day  while Richard Cantillon inspired Adam Smith  among others  John B  Cosgrave was a specialist in number theory and discovered a 2000 digit prime number in 1999 and a record composite Fermat number in 2003  John Lighton Synge made progress in different fields of science  including mechanics and geometrical methods in general relativity  He had mathematician John Nash as one of his students  Ireland has eight universities and numerous Institutes of Technologies as well as The Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies  which was established in 1940 with physicist Erwin Schr dinger as director  166  Sport Main article  Sport in Ireland See also  List of Irish sports people Gaelic football is the

commercial sponsorship  The Irish Football Association  IFA  was originally the governing body for soccer across the island  The game has been played in an organised fashion in Ireland since the 1870s  with Cliftonville F C  in Belfast being Ireland s oldest club  It was most popular  especially in its first decades  around Belfast and in Ulster  However  some clubs based outside Belfast thought that the IFA largely favoured Ulster based  Protestant clubs in such matters as selection for the national team  In 1921  following an incident in which  despite an earlier promise  the IFA moved an Irish Cup semi final replay from Dublin to Belfast 173  Dublin based clubs broke away to form the Football Association of the Irish Free State  Today the southern association is known as the Football Association of Ireland  FAI   Despite being initially blacklisted by the Home Nations  associations  the FAI was recognised by FIFA in 1923 and organised its first international fixture in 1926  against Italy   However  both the IFA and FAI continued to select their teams from the whole of Ireland  with some players earning international caps for matches with both teams  Both also referred to their respective teams as Ireland  Paul O Connell reaching for the ball during a line out against Argentina in 2007  In 1950  FIFA directed the associations only to select players from within their respective territories and  in 1953  directed that the FAI s team be known only as  Republic of Ireland  and that the IFA s team be known as  Northern Ireland   with certain exceptions   Northern

Clarke s latest victory was the 2011 Open Championship at Royal St  George  The west coast of Ireland  Lahinch and Donegal Bay in particular  have popular surfing beaches  being fully exposed to the Atlantic Ocean  Donegal Bay is shaped like a funnel and catches west south west Atlantic winds  creating good surf  especially in winter  In recent years  Bundoran has hosted European championship surfing  Scuba diving is increasingly popular in Ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life  particularly along the western seaboard  There are also many shipwrecks along the coast of Ireland  with some of the best wreck dives being in Malin Head and off the County Cork coast  191  With thousands of lakes  over 14 000 kilometres  8 700 mi  of fish bearing rivers and over 3 700 kilometres  2 300 mi  of coastline  Ireland is a popular angling destination  The temperate Irish climate is suited to sport angling  While salmon and trout fishing remain popular with anglers  salmon fishing in particular received a boost in 2006 with the closing of the salmon driftnet fishery  Coarse fishing continues to increase its profile  Sea angling is developed with many beaches mapped and signposted  192  and the range of sea angling species is around 80  193  Food and drink Gubbeen cheese  an example of the resurgence in Irish cheese making Food and cuisine in Ireland takes its influence from the crops grown and animals farmed in the island s temperate climate and from the social and political circumstances of Irish history  For example  whilst from the Middle Ages until the arrival of the potato in the 16th century the dominant feature of the Irish economy was the herding of cattle  the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing  194  Thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk producing cow  194  For this reason  pork and white meat were more common than beef and thick fatty strips of salted bacon  or rashers  and the eating of salted butter  i e  a dairy product rather than beef itself  have been a central feature of the diet in Ireland since the Middle Ages  194  The practice of bleeding cattle and mixing the blood with milk and butter  not unlike the practice of the Maasai  was common 195  and black pudding  made from blood  grain  usually barley  and seasoning  remains a breakfast staple in Ireland  All of these influences can be seen today in the phenomenon of the  breakfast roll   The introduction of the potato in the second half of the 16th century heavily influenced cuisine thereafter  Great poverty encouraged a subsistence approach to food and by the mid 19th century the vast majority of the population sufficed with a diet of potatoes and milk  196  A typical family  consisting of a man  a woman and four children  would eat 18 stone  110 kg  of potatoes a week  194  Consequently  dishes that are considered as national dishes represent a fundamental unsophistication to cooking  such as the Irish stew  bacon and cabbage  boxty  a type of potato pancake  or colcannon  a dish of mashed potatoes and kale or cabbage  194  Since the last quarter of the 20th century  with a re emergence of wealth in Ireland  a  New Irish Cuisine  based on traditional ingredients incorporating international influences 197  has emerged  198  This cuisine is based on fresh vegetables  fish  especially salmon  trout  oysters  mussels and other shellfish   as well as traditional soda breads and the wide range of hand made cheeses that are now being produced across the country  The potato remains however a fundamental feature of this cuisine and the Irish remain the highest per capita 194  consumers of potatoes in Europe  An example of this new cuisine is  Dublin Lawyer   lobster cooked in whiskey and cream  199  Traditional regional foods can be found throughout the country  for example coddle in Dublin or drisheen in Cork  both a type of sausage  or blaa  a doughy white bread particular to Waterford  The Old Bushmills Distillery in County Antrim Ireland once dominated the world s market for whiskey  producing 90  of the world s whiskey at the start of the 20th century  However  as a consequence of bootleggers during the prohibition in the United States  who sold poor quality whiskey bearing Irish sounding names thus eroding the pre prohibition popularity for Irish brands  200  and tariffs on Irish whiskey across British Empire during the Anglo Irish Trade War of the 1930s  201  sales of Irish whiskey worldwide fell to a mere 2  by the mid 20th century  202  In 1953  an Irish government survey  found that 50 per cent of whiskey drinkers in the United States had never heard of Irish whiskey  203  Irish whiskey  however  remained popular domestically and in recent decades has grown in popularity again internationally  204  Typically  Irish whiskey is not as smoky as a Scotch whisky  but not as sweet as American or Canadian whiskies  204  Whiskey forms the basis of traditional cream liqueurs  such as Baileys  and the  Irish coffee   a cocktail of coffee and whiskey reputedly invented at Foynes flying boat station  is probably the best known Irish cocktail  Stout  a kind of porter beer  particularly Guinness  is typically associated with Ireland  although historically it was more closely associated with London  Porter remains very popular  although it has lost sales since the mid 20th century to lager  Cider  particularly Magners  marketed in the Republic of Ireland as Bulmers   is also a popular drink  Red lemonade  a soft drink  is consumed on its own and as a mixer  particularly with whiskey  205  See also Geography portal Europe portal Ireland portal Outline of Ireland Irish states since 1171 List of divided islands List of Ireland
