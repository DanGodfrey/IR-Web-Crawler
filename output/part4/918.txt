series  Summers remained a member of the team up through Uncanny X Men  201 when he left the Uncanny X Men title to be featured in the launch of a new series by Marvel  This new series  X Factor  launched in 1986 and would star the original Uncanny X Men team of Cyclops  Marvel Girl  Beast  Iceman  and Angel  Scott would stay with the X Factor title through X Factor  70  In October 1991  Summers returns to the X Men to launch X Men  1  2nd series   5  This series would be the second of two X Men titles and would feature Cyclops  Wolverine  Gambit  Psylocke  Rogue  and the Beast as Blue team  Cyclops has recently been featured in another title launch with the second introduction of a new X Men series Astonishing X Men  Astonishing X Men features Cyclops  Wolverine  Shadowcat  Colossus  Emma Frost  and the Beast as a team  Throughout this time Cyclops would continue to make appearances in Uncanny X Men  6  7  Marvel has also used Cyclops to launch variant series of X Men titles most notably Ultimate X Men and New X Men  Cyclops has appeared in limited series including Adventures of Cyclops  amp  Phoenix  Further Adventures of Cyclops  amp  Phoenix  X Men  The Asgardian Wars  the second series of Astonishing X Men  X Men  The Search for Cyclops  his own self titled series Cyclops  8  and X Men Origins  Cyclops  1  Cyclops  first appearance was in X Men  1 created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby  They wrote the majority of the first issues in the series  In 1975  writer Chris Claremont started his tenure on the series with Uncanny X Men  94  He went on to write for the title over the next 16 years until 1991 when Jim Lee took over as the series artist  In 1991  writer Brian K  Vaughan worked on the self titled series Cyclops  1 4  In 2000  Joseph Harris wrote the four issue run titled X Men  The Search for Cyclops that dealt with Cyclops  return after merging with Apocalypse in the events of the Twelve from Uncanny X Men  377  In 2004  writer Joss Whedon wrote a variant of the series Astonishing X Men  During Joss Whedon s run of Astonishing X Men  Cyclops adopted a new attitude unfamiliar to most accustomed fans  After Emma s psychic intervention at the mansion  he temporarily lost his powers after owning up to his self inflicted  traumatic past  This prompted an interview with Joss Whedon in Wizard magazine  182  when asked if Cyclops didn t have his powers any more  Whedon replied that  No  he doesn t have his powers  Well  he had a choice to either be completely out of control or bury them  He can t use them  That s pretty much it  But the thing that would be fun is that  with no powers  he s going to be the best that he s ever been  That s what the arc is about   Cyclops has  been the team leader and the team washout in terms of popularity  He was defined by Jean so much  and I just think that this guy is so interesting in his struggle against mediocrity  Then  when it s all laid on the line  when you find out the thing that s been holding him back from being just a complete bad ass has been himself all his life  that he s been lying to everyone  including himself  about who he is that should be freeing  The Scott we re going to see is going to be a little bit different  This guy is either completely out of control or in control of something we re not used to  I wanted him to be an unabashed tough guy  He is shooting people and turning very much into a leader  Not everyone is going to like it   Now  the X Men leader has become more confident  outspoken  and audacious  This has had a significant effect on his leadership and his respect among fellow teammates  most notably Wolverine   edit  Fictional character biography Cyclops  history has undergone various revisions  both minor and major  The central fixed element is the character s origin story  As a young boy  Scott Summers is orphaned after watching his parents die in a plane crash  Scott and his brother  Alex  are the only survivors  Their parents placed the two boys in the only available parachute and forced them to jump from the plane just prior to crashing  The boys become wards of the state and are separated  When Scott s powers manifest uncontrollably he runs away from the orphanage and wanders before being taken in as ward by Charles Xavier   edit  Youth When Scott was a boy growing up in Anchorage  Alaska  his father  USAF Major Christopher Summers  took the family for a flight in their de Havilland Mosquito  It came under attack by an alien Shi ar spaceship  As the plane went down in flames  Scott s parents fastened him and his younger brother Alex into a parachute and pushed them off the plane  hoping that they would survive  9  In Cyclops  first appearance in X Men  1  he is already leading the X Men under tutelage of Professor X  Later  Scott s origin is first presented in Uncanny X Men  38 42 and later refined in Uncanny X Men  144 and Uncanny X Men  156  In 2010  Marvel released X Men Origins  Cyclops  1 that describes the character s childhood through his joining the X Men  The early accounts in the X Men comics use flashbacks to tell the origin story of Scott parachuting from his parents  plane  The flashbacks are often told from various narrative perspectives and place different emphasis on the events of this period  Scott s poor control over his power have been attributed to events in his childhood  In Uncanny X Men  156  Scott s parachute caught fire and Scott struck his head upon landing  This caused brain damage to Scott which is responsible for his poor control over his optic blasts  10  Several origin stories do not feature the head injury account with X Men Origins  Cyclops  1 being the most recent  9  11  12  The head injury account has also been retconned in Astonishing X Men Vol  2 as being due to a self imposed mental block he made as a child to deal with the traumatic events of his life  13  With the help of Emma Frost  Scott is able to briefly bypass his own mental block and control his powers  14  though he reveals that his control is waning and temporary  15  For a time Scott had prolonged amnesia about his childhood  Parts of his memory returned when he was unexpectedly attacked by the demon D Spayre while on a leave of absence after Jean Grey s perceived first death  12  Scott spent most of his childhood in an orphanage in Omaha  Nebraska and was subjected to batteries of tests and experiments by the orphanage s owner  Mr  Milbury  an alias for the geneticist Mister Sinister  who also placed mental blocks on Scott  16   edit  Ancestry In The Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix limited series  both Scott and Jean were sent back in time to 19th century England by Madame Sanctity  a surviving member of the Askani sisterhood  In 1860  prior to the epilogue of the story  a young English orphan named Daniel  who was freed  one year ago  from the clutches of Nathaniel Essex by Scott and Jean  is shown arriving in New York Harbor from London  As a form of reverence toward the couple who recently showed him great kindness  when urged by his apparent guardian to adopt a new surname at the immigration station  Daniel chooses Summers  Although Scott does not make the familial connection between Daniel and himself  he suspects that his presence in this time  along with Jean s  did something else to affect the course of history  aside from stopping Mister Sinister and Apocalypse  17   edit  The X Men Cyclops projecting an optic blast  Art by Jack Kirby  When Scott is sixteen  he runs away from the orphanage  and while wandering the streets is taken in by Charles Xavier  On a trip to New York with his orphanage supervisor Scott walks across a construction site and his optic beam activates  The blast

her  afraid he would be hurt again or that his optic blasts would hurt her   or anyone else he cared about for that matter   and also because he feels he is no match for his wealthy teammate Warren Worthington III  a k a  Angel  who is at first also romantically interested in Jean  What Scott doesn t know is that Jean actually has a crush on him  but is too shy to make a move  Finally  on Bobby

of being bonded with Apocalypse  This change causes a rift between him and Jean  he claims that Apocalypse made him question not only their relationship  but his life as a whole  He is instrumental in preventing the mutant Xorn s suicide and in recruiting the powerful mutant to the X Men  The two establish a close friendship  similarly  repeated missions with Wolverine result in the growth of a tentative friendship between the two veteran X Men  When Jean begins to show signs of the Phoenix Force again  the distance between the two grows larger and Scott begins abstaining from sex with Jean for the five months  Jean attempts several times to confront Cyclops  but he continues to push her away  claiming that Apocalypse had changed him too much on the inside  43  Jean  confused by the change in their relationship  confides in Logan and the two kiss in the woods outside the school  but Logan walks away telling her that she should remain with Scott  44  Xavier leaves Earth while under the control of Cassandra Nova and Jean is left as Headmistress of the school  Her new responsibilities along with her growing powers  force Jean to put her attention elsewhere leaving Scott feeling ignored and his trauma from being possessed trivialized  Instead of attempting to reconcile with her  Scott turns to Emma Frost for consolation  feeling that he can talk to Emma about his problems  Their relationship ostensibly begins as a series of psychic therapy sessions  but Emma takes advantage of this situation to get closer to Scott  Under the guise of counseling him  she instigates a telepathic affair  45  When Phoenix discovers the affair  Cyclops claims he and Emma shared only thoughts and thus had done nothing wrong  Meanwhile  Emma s snide and mocking jeers

expectations  and demands which he feels are unjustly placed on him by the X Men  He then accompanies Wolverine and Fantomex to the government created time pocket called The World and then Asteroid M  During his time with Wolverine  Scott reveals that he feels his relationship with Jean is stagnant and that the two of them had not progressed romantically since their initial teenage romance  He also confesses that he feels that Jean is so concerned with the school and her new powers that the two no longer communicate like before and that he feels left behind due to Jean once again being connected to the Phoenix Force  When Scott finally returns to the X Men  their new teammate Xorn  who was revealed to be Magneto  but was subsequently retconned as an imposter  attacks the X Men  Having at last reached full Phoenix power  Jean confronts Xorn Magneto and is killed in the process  As she is dying  Scott apologizes for hurting her  but Jean instead tells him that she understands and has never seen him more alive and urges him to live on   edit  Headmaster Scott  however  is devastated by Jean s death  and considers leaving the X Men once more  It was revealed in the  Here Comes Tomorrow  storyline that  had he done so  it would have led to an apocalyptic alternate future  To prevent this  a resurrected  future version of Jean uses her powers as the White Phoenix of the Crown and telepathically nudged Cyclops into a real relationship with Emma  reaching out to him from this alternate future  Together  the pair rebuild the Xavier Institute as co headmasters  The new relationship between Emma and Scott leads to problems between them and the rest of the X Men  all of whom believe that the pair are doing Jean s memory a disservice  Rachel Summers in particular feels hurt and angry by her father s lack of remorse for the psychic affair that hurt Jean before her death and Emma s part in it  and takes on the last name of Grey in place of Summers  The other X Men eventually come to accept the relationship and both Scott and Emma manage to reconcile with Rachel in their own ways  such as introducing Rachel to Jean s other family members  Deciding that the X Men need to play more of a role in emergency rescue and aid  and thus garner attention on mutants in a more positive light where mutant abilities are used for the good of people  Cyclops hand picks a new team in Astonishing X Men  which is subsequently used by Marvel as the chief representation of the X Men  The team faces an alien named Ord of the Breakworld  who supplies Earth scientist Dr  Kavita Rao with a  cure  for mutation  The team subdue Ord  but not before learning that one of their own will be responsible for the destruction of Ord s homeworld in the coming year  Not long after  the X Men s Danger Room becomes sentient  attacking the X Men and seeking to ultimately kill Xavier  Calling itself  Danger    she  reveals that Xavier knew she had been self aware since Shi ar technology was installed in the Danger Room years ago  but chose to ignore her  effectively inhumanely using her only to train his teams of X Men  After her defeat on the island of Genosha  the X Men abandoned Xavier in disgust  with Cyclops no longer welcoming Xavier s input at the School or with the team  Cyclops also tutored a squad at the institute called The Corsairs  named after Cyclops  father  The team consisted of Dryad  Quill  Specter  and the three remaining Stepford Cuckoos   edit  Astonishing X Men In Astonishing X Men  14  during an impromptu telepathic  therapy session   Emma Frost presented Cyclops with the possibility that his lack of control over his optic blasts actually stems not from physical brain damage  but from a sort of mental block that the young Scott imposed upon himself after the combined traumas of the loss of his parents  separation from his brother  and shocking manifestation of his powers  this is seen as a coping mechanism  giving Scott something to focus on and try to maintain some sort of control over at a time when events completely out of his control had effectively shattered the life he had led up to that point  Scott admits that this theory is the truth  further admitting that he had blocked making this decision out of his memory  to preserve the fallacy in his own mind and prevent others from discovering his  secret   The issue ends with Scott apparently in a catatonic state  with his eyes uncovered and displaying their natural shade of brown  with no evidence of his powers manifesting  Later he manifests  and has full control over his optical blasts  although it was only temporary  47   edit  Deadly Genesis Main article  X Men  Deadly Genesis After the events of House of M  nearly all mutants were left depowered  and Xavier was missing  A mysterious villain then attacked and easily defeated several members of the team  including Cyclops and his alternate reality daughter  Rachel  The two were captured and taken to

to be Vulcan   who informed Cyclops that he was the X Man s younger brother  A powerless Professor Xavier confirmed this information in the final book of the miniseries  This new information has left

San Francisco as a whole  As a result  the Mayor of the city offers to help the X Men reestablish themselves in the city  52  After building a new headquarters  Cyclops sends word to all the world s mutants that San Francisco  which has welcomed the X Men with open arms  is now a safe haven for mutant kind and that all are welcomed to join them  53  The X Men s presence is widely approved of by San Francisco  including the police  who now hire the team to aid them in cases that might be out of their area  54  Cyclops dispatches Wolverine to track down Mystique and revives X Force as a clandestine black ops team whose mission is to take down threats to mutankind that they cannot deal with while under the public eye  Cyclops places Wolverine in charge of the team and adamantly keeps

the public  However  Cyclops utilizes other X Men for parts of the groups mission  including Beast and the Stepford Cuckoos  The team is sometimes less careful  leaving blood stained clothing around  piquing Emma s suspicions  The controversy of Cyclops  decisions as leader of the X Men is further highlighted during the Skrull invasion of San Francisco when he readily utilizes biological warfare against the Skrulls by knowingly infecting them with an adapted version of the Mutant Legacy Virus created by Beast without first determining if there was also a cure  56  In another controversial decision  Cyclops sends X Force to track down the Leper Queen who is infecting mutants with a strain of the Legacy Virus to use their uncontrolled powers in attacks against humanity in order to stir

Cooperstown  Alaska from X Men  Messiah Complex is eventually released to the media by Simon Trask  designed to deceive the public into believing that the destruction was caused by the newborn mutant messiah rather than the Purifiers  55  The footage  coupled with Trask s newly formed  Humanity Now  Coalition  pushing anti mutant legislation  dubbed  Proposition X   aiming to control mutant reproduction  causes an increase in mutant hate crimes  causing Scott to open the X Men s base to anyone seeking refuge  58  During this time  his growing secrecy concerning X Force and Emma s suspicions that he is keeping something from her which begins creating a rift between himself and Emma  59  Taking advice from Storm that Scott s actions are always in the best interest of mutant kind  Emma secretly agrees to participate in Norman Osborn s Cabal in her own attempt to insure the protection of the mutant population  60  Scott encounters his dead ex wife  Madelyne Pryor  again when she inexplicably returns as a psychic ghost  61  62  calling herself the Red Queen and with a newly assembled all female team of mutants calling themselves the Sisterhood  63  Her team attacks the X Men and Madelyne steals a lock of Jean s hair in Wolverine s possession  with the goal of using it to locate and inhabit Jean s body  allowing her to be reborn  64  Scott employs Domino to exhume Jean s grave and swap her body with another  Unaware of the switch and spurning Scott s attempt to reach out to her  Madelyne attempts to possess the body  but seemingly disintegrates into nothingness as no other body than Jean Grey s can house an entity of Madelyne s level of power  62   edit  Utopia Dark Reign After the battle with Madelyne and the Sisterhood  Beast confronts Scott and Emma  stating that he is aware of both of their clandestine actions and that they will discuss them at length together or their secrets will tear the X Men apart  65  In the limited crossover tie in  Dark X Men Dark Avengers  Utopia  the growing unrest among the mutant population and calculated instigation from Trask and Humanity Now  leads to violent rioting from mutants against the anti mutant coalition in San Francisco  Though supported by the mayor  Cyclops is largely viewed as the leader of the remaining mutant population by the media and he takes the brunt of negative media and public opinion  implicated as endorsing and sending the X Men to lead the rioting  Trask capitalizes on the hysteria  portraying Humanity Now  as victims of oppression in order to push Proposition X  Norman Osborn utilizes the Dark Avengers to stop the riots and arrest Cyclops and his team of X Men  calling in Emma to lead a new team of  Dark  X Men  Emma agrees to lead the team  which will answer to Osborn  as the Black Queen  Marvel writer Matt Fraction indicated that Emma s alliance with Osborn will place Scott and Emma at odds with one another  providing  a profound schism   66  Cyclops travels to Osborn s base on Alcatraz Island to speak with him  Osborn tells Cyclops that they can end the riots and hysteria here right now but Cyclops interrupts him and orders him to surrender  A shocked Osborn asks what he means and Cyclops replies that Osborn needs to get the riots under control and then withdraw H A M M E R  and the Dark Avengers and leave San Francisco to him and the X Men  When Osborn refuses Cyclops leaves telling Osborn that he tried  After Cyclops leaves  Osborn tells Victoria Hand that when the time comes Osborn is going to kill Cyclops personally  67  As Emma s Dark X Men slowly get the city under control  Cyclops continues to form his plans to deal with the situation  Scott assigns his X Men  such as Mirage  Domino  Mindee Cuckoo  and Psylocke  different tasks  as well as having another team observe Emma s team  as they deal with a group of bio sentinels attacking San Francisco  When asked how they re expected to take out both the Dark X Men and Dark Avengers  Scott retorts  Who said you re the squad that s supposed to stop the Avengers   68  Scott s plan finally comes together as he has Magik teleport X Force into H A M M E R s Alcatraz Island  where they take on the Dark X Men and Avengers  while Magik teleports all the captured mutants to safety  X Force is aided by Emma and Namor  who are revealed to be double agents against Osborn  Immediately after  Scott has the X Club resurrect Asteroid M which crashed into the Pacific Coast a few years prior  Cyclops then orders Magik and Pixie to teleport every X Man and allied mutant to what he now calls  Utopia   During a press conference  Cyclops informs the world that they have left the United States and that they reject Norman Osborn and his methods  69  During this time period  Cyclops struggles to define what he wants Utopia to be  nation base etc   Utopia is attacked by numerous threats  including the events of  Necrosha    Infernus 2   and  Fear Itself   After the discovery of X Force  Beast leaves Utopia and blames Cyclops for terrible judgement in how he is running Utopia  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Second Coming and Age Of Heroes Sometime after Utopia began  Cable returns back to present day Westchester  New York with Hope Summers  the baby believed to be the mutant Messiah  As Cable had no idea that Cyclops and the X Men moved to Utopia  Cyclops deploys his senior team of X Men to search and rescue just as the purifiers and Nimrod begin their attack on Cable and Hope  During the rescue  Nightcrawler is KIA teleporting Hope back to Utopia  Cyclops holds a funeral for his fallen friend  one of the few who really believed in Scott s belief of the mutant messiah   Beast arrives on Utopia for the funeral and blames Cyclops for the loss of Nightcrawler  Shortly after  an impenetrable field surrounds Utopia and sentinels from the future begin to attack  Cyclops is forced to send a team of X Men into the future led by Cable  but upon their return Cyclops and Hope watch Cable die from a combination of the techno virus and time travel  After Nimrod and the purifiers are defeated  Cyclops holds a funeral for his fallen son  As Emma Frost witnesses a sign of the Phoenix manifesting in Hope  she runs to tell Scott who dismisses her as he sees he was right all along  Cerebra detected 5 brand new mutant signals  Cyclops deploys Hope to recruit the new mutant signals and they become her team known as  The Lights   Shortly after  Cyclops is awarded a medal by Commander Steve Rogers for his acts  70   edit  Fear Itself A possessed Juggernaut escapes Thunderbolts captivity and begins to make his way west to San Francisco to either destroy Utopia or destroy San Francisco  depending on which side would give up the other first  Cyclops deploys multiple attempts to stop the Norse powered Juggernaut to no avail  As one of his final plans  Cyclops sends Magik  Colossus  and Shadowcat to meet with Cyttorak to convince him to take away the powers he gave Juggernaut  Cyttorak agrees in exchange for making Colossus the new Juggernaut avatar and is able to push Cain Marko back until Cain is summoned by The Serpent  71   edit  Schism At the beginning of Schism  Cyclops thanks Wolverine for always being there for him as they seem to finally have come to a mutually spoken and understood respect for each other after years of fighting and rivalry  While at a conference for weapon control  Kid Omega  Quentin Quire  launches a psychic terrorist attack on the ambassadors present  In response  sentinels are deployed at the conference and are disposed of by Cyclops and Wolverine  Due to growing fears of mutant threat  countries around the world begin to mobilize their Sentinel forces  Cyclops begins to deploy X Men around the globe to deal with the threat  Sometime after  Kid Omega shows up on Utopia to plead for amnesty  Wolverine tries to attack Kid Omega when Cyclops stops him  When Kid Omega insults Wolverine  Cyclops defends Wolverine and demands Quentin to be quiet  Later  Cyclops sends a team of some of his most powerful X Men  as well as some of the island students  to a local mutant museum exhibit as a  show of force   Wolverine goes to a local bar to sulk in his aggravation with the current situation  The new Hellfire Club attacks the exhibit and incapacitate all senior X Men present  As Cyclops flies to the museum from Utopia and Wolverine rushes to help from the bar  Idie asks if she should kill the Hellfire Club to help  While Wolverine protests against it profusely  Cyclops tells Idie to do what she feels is right  Idie kills almost every Hellfire Club member left to save her friends and mentors  Wolverine pops his claws at Cyclops in anger that he used a child to save the day  but restrains himself when he realizes what he s doing  72  From the wreckage of the museum  a sentinel begins to form  Cyclops returns to Utopia to devise a strategy against the threat  Cyclops realizes the X Men have been setup to have all senior active X Men either incapacitated or on the other side of the globe  and in a desperate feat of rage tries to destroy the sentinel from a far with a powerful optic blast  with no result  The island students approach Cyclops to offer help  and Cyclops begins to organize strategies with them  Wolverine swims on to Utopia and tells the mutant children that they need to leave  Cyclops tells the students to fight together and that they can beat the sentinel  but Wolverine objects to using children to fight battles  Cyclops argues that the students need to stay and fight or they will always be running and begins to prepare the students for combat  Shortly after Wolverine returns with a detonator to blow up Utopia and orders all remaining people on the island to evacuate  Cyclops and Wolverine s frustration with each other come to ahead when Cyclops brings up Jean Grey saying that she never loved Wolverine and was always frightened of him  Wolverine replies  And if she were here right now  who do you think she would be more frightened of   The two fight each other in a rage while being attacked by the sentinel and as Wolverine claws into Cyclops visor  the students reappear on the battlefield to help them fight the sentinel  In the morning  Cyclops and Wolverine stand victorious with the students all living  but Wolverine can t continue watching Cyclops use children as soldiers to fight these battles  Wolverine announces his departure from Utopia and indicates he will take any mutant on the island who wants to leave with him  Beast leaves Cyclops a voicemail to reiterate his disapproval of how Cyclops is running Utopia and his support for Wolverine  73   edit  X Men  Regenesis While Wolverine doesn t leave as an enemy of Cyclops and his X Men  he makes clear he wants both sides to stay out of the others business  Wolverine returns to Westchester  New York to open the Jean Grey School for the Gifted while Cyclops organizes new teams of X Men and remains on Utopia  74   edit  Relationships The wedding of Scott Summers and Jean Grey  X Men  30  art by Andy Kubert  Cyclops has had multiple serious relationships and is rarely written without a romantic female relationship  Cyclops s relationships are particularly complicated because of the many retcons involved in the publication history of the Jean Grey and Madelyne Pryor characters  In terms of publication time  Cyclops s longest relationship would be with Jean Grey  whom he would eventually marry but not before she would appear to tragically die protecting the X Men  Grieving from this loss  Scott leaves to the Summers family reunion where he meets and starts to pursue Madelyne Pryor  Scott would become obsessed with Madelyne s similarity to Jean  75  Madelyne would turn out to be a clone of Jean and would be made into a supervillain but not before Scott marries Madelyne and has a child with her  A love triangle would later be created when Jean is re awakened from a coma and brought back to life by the Fantastic Four  These relationships would be resolved over the duration of Cyclops s appearance in the X Factor series  His son would grow up to be the character Cable  Jean Grey and Scott would finally marry in X Men  30  When Cyclops married Jean Grey  he seemed to have reached a happy ending  Subsequently  Scott would become possessed by Apocalypse and the lingering effects from this would taint his relationship with Jean  This combined with Jean s returning Phoenix powers creates stress in their relationship  Confused Scott turns to Emma Frost  who takes advantage of Scott s emotional problems  which leads to a telepathic extramarital affair  76  When confronted by Jean  Scott claims that they shared  only thoughts  and that he had done nothing wrong  Jean  however  disagrees and demands that Emma explain herself  but Emma only jeers and insults her  Enraged  Jean unleashes the Phoenix power on Emma  rifling through her memories and forcing her to confront the truth about herself  In the aftermath  Scott then leaves the X Men for a time to understand his own conflicting feelings  He returned to tell Emma that he had made a decision between her and Jean  but Jean was killed in battle before it was revealed which woman he had picked  After Jean s death  Scott feels disillusioned with Xavier s dream  leaves the X Men  and refuses Emma s offer to reopen the school  Had the school remained closed  this outcome would have led to an apocalyptic future  To avoid it  Jean  who was resurrected in this apocalyptic future  used her Phoenix Powers to absorb this future timeline into the White Hot Room  She then mentally pushed Scott past the guilt he felt over her death and made him accept Emma s offer of reopening the school with her  The two have since been together  although not without problems  particularly in light of the  House of M  storyline in which Emma has alienated herself from many people by completely reformatting the school s workings and the events involving the Hellfire Club s return  As of the Divided We Stand stories  their relationship seems to be back on track  The relationship begins to deteriorate again with Cyclops keeping secrets about the actions of X Force  77  and Emma not telling him of her agreement to join Norman Osborn s secret alliance known as the Cabal  78  However  both had their secrets revealed to each other and their relationship seems to be back on track once again  apparently stronger than ever  79  Unfortunately  almost immediately after  their relationship hit a new road bump  During a battle with Osborn s Dark Avengers  Emma absorbed a piece of the Void  a dark evil power  from the mind of Sentry  In order to keep the bit of evil contained  Emma has transformed permanently into her diamond form  While this keeps the evil power from accessing her enormous psionic capabilities  it shuts off Emma s emotions and empathy  causing her to become cold  rude  and snide towards all  even her boyfriend  volume  amp  issue needed  Cyclops  Xavier  and Psyocke eventually go into Emma s head to remove the Void piece  only for it to become stuck in Cyclops  head instead  However  Cyclops is able to trap the Void piece inside a psychic prison  rendering it harmless  and leaving his relationship with Emma strong once more  volume  amp  issue needed  One striking feature about Cyclops s romantic relationship is the fact that he seems attracted to women with telepathic abilities and vice versa original research    He was married to both Jean Grey and her clone Madelyne Pryor  who both proved to have very strong telepathy  His latest girlfriend  Emma Frost  is a high order telepath  Psylocke  another powerful psionic talent  once blatantly tried to seduce him   80  Scott has been known  however  to date non mutant women  in particular during the period in which he thought Jean Grey to be dead  He was known to date Colleen Wing  29 Lee Forrester  81  and finally Madelyne Pryor  who at the time was thought to be a powerless baseline human  34   edit  Powers and abilities Cyclops has the power to emit beams of energy from his eyes described as an  optic blast   The beams have the appearance of red light  i e   electromagnetic radiation in a red wavelength   however  they do not give off heat and instead deliver concussive force without recoil  The beams are tremendously powerful and can be used to rupture steel plates and pulverize rock  In addition varying the beam width  height  and intensity  Cyclops has demonstrated a high degree of skill and accuracy in manipulating his optic blast  Cyclops is able to reflect the beam off hard and shiny surfaces  12  82  83  This feat also demonstrates his intuitive sense of spatial geometry between objects  12  82  The reflective qualities of the beams allows him to bounce the beam off many different surfaces in rapid succession  The effective range of his optic beam is approximately 2 000 ft  It has been observed to be focused tight enough to punch a pin hole through a coin  84  drill through the trunk of a log  85  and pierce the skin of the Blob  86  Cyclops has shown the power of his optic blast by blasting through the walls of a hardened building  87  tunneling through solid rock  88  and blowing the top off a mountain  36  Cyclops  force beams were measured by Iron Man to be almost 2 Gigawatts  89  Two Gigawatts is about half the peak power output of the Doel Nuclear Power Plant and when Cyclops released this much energy he exceeded his control over his optic beam  With Cyclops unable to shut off his optic beam  Leech came to his aid and negated his mutant power  89  Against other Marvel characters  Cyclops has been able to use his optic beam to knock Thor s Hammer from his hand  90  He is known to be able to overload Bishop s energy absorption power and is revealed to never have willingly used more than a small fraction of his full potential due to his anxiety regarding his optic blast  48  Early accounts describe Cyclops  optic beams as the product of his body metabolizing sunlight and other ambient energy  91  This is similar to his brother Alex  alias Havok  who metabolizes cosmic radiation  This metabolized energy is then released in the form of the beam from his eyes  In some stories Cyclops depletes his body s energy reserves and needs to recharge through exposure to sunlight  When depleted Cyclops continued to emit the beams  however  their intensity was greatly diminished  One story showed him able to safely open his eyes when in complete darkness without any ambient light to absorb  his power diminished to the point that he didn t need his visor  volume  amp  issue needed  Modern accounts state that Cyclops  eyes contain inter dimensional apertures  releasing powerful energies from another dimension into his own via the beams  These later accounts state that his body naturally metabolizes ambient energy that is used to open and focus the apertures in his eyes  The energy of the beam itself originates from this other dimension  Cyclops  body is naturally immune to the beams  force  92  His mind projects a psionic field that envelops his body rendering it immune to his optic beam  allowing him to shut it off by simply closing his eyes  Scott is also immune to the power of his brother Alex  Havok  who has the ability to emit waves of energy that heat the air into plasma  Likewise Havok has demonstrated immunity to Cyclops  optic beam  Scott has been shown as being able to absorb Storm s lightning bolt  although this act caused Cyclops a great deal of pain  93  The ruby quartz used in his battle visor has been said to be resonate with his body s psionic field  Scott has only a limited resistance to his brother Vulcan s powers  For all Cyclops  skill in manipulating his optic beam  it continuously projects from his eyes whenever they are open and unprotected  To prevent the destruction of any objects in his field of view  Cyclops uses a pair of ruby quartz eye glasses developed by Professor X to contain the devastating rays  In his X Men uniform he uses a ruby quartz battle visor in place of the glasses  His uniform has firing studs incorporated into his gloves and on the sides of the battle visor that control the visor s aperture  In the event that the visor has a power failure  the apertures are spring loaded to automatically close so Cyclops can at least see normally  He has also been observed using casual sunglasses and contact lenses made from the same ruby quartz as his visor lens  94  Scott s poor control over his power is attributed to events in his childhood  10  95  His lack of control is initially described as being due to a head wound during his childhood  disabling his brain s ability to turn off his optic blasts  10  Later depictions explained that his lack of control is psychosomatic and due to the emotionally traumatic events of his childhood  95  This later explanation allowed Cyclops to finally control his optic blasts for a short time during a mission on the Breakworld  though at the conclusion of these events  he revealed that he was beginning to lose control again and reverted to using his visor and lenses  95   edit  Skills Spatial Awareness  Cyclops seems to possess an uncanny sense of geometry  in this sense used to describe his observation of objects around himself and the angles found between surfaces of these objects  Cyclops has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to cause his optic blasts to ricochet and or reflect off those objects in a trajectory to his liking  This is commonly called a  banked shot  when applied to this talent  Cyclops has been observed causing beams to reflect from over a dozen surfaces in the course of one blast  and still hit his intended target accurately  It is his sense of superhumanly enhanced spatial awareness that allows him to perform these feats as well  12  82  On two occasions Cyclops has been fast enough to blindly predict the position of Quicksilver and Northstar who were moving at superhuman speeds with enough accuracy to hit them with his optic blast  96  97  Expert Pilot  Cyclops is an expert pilot of fixed wing aircraft  a skill he appears to have inherited from his father  It has also been implied that his geometric sense improves his abilities in the air  Master Strategist and Tactician  Cyclops has spent most of his superhero career as the leader of either the X Men or X Factor and has developed exceptional leadership skills  According to Nick Fury s files  Scott s abilities are at their best in tense situations  Fury notes that the less time Cyclops has to think about a decision  the better that decision is  98  Sebastian Shaw reflects on Cyclops s skill in taking advantage of the single flaw in the Hellfire Club s defense to reverse a dire situation for the X Men in Uncanny X Men  134  In another issue  the X Men are hypnotized into thinking Cyclops is the Dark Phoenix  they try to hunt him down  After thwarting Colossus  Nightcrawler  and Storm in quick succession  he flees to the Danger Room  Inside  he creates a jungle environment in which to hide from his fellow X Men  They attempt to hunt him down  but he outwits them  defeating Shadowcat  Wolverine  Colossus  Storm  and Rogue  all the while suffering from broken ribs  99  In Uncanny X Men  150  Cyclops organizes the X Men to defeat Magneto at a time when the team is denied their mutant powers  Master Martial Artist  Cyclops also has extensive training in martial arts and unarmed combat  holding black belts in judo and aikido  During the  Riot at Xavier s  storyline Cyclops faces off against Quentin Quire s Omega Gang and can be observed doing a cartwheel while firing his optic blast at Radian s leg  100  In a fight with the Horseman of Apocalypse named War  Cyclops executes an acrobatic flip off a statue in the graveyard and while inverted in mid air fires his optic blast into the mouth of the robotic mount  101   edit  Other versions Main article  Alternative versions of Cyclops  edit  In other media Main article  Cyclops in
