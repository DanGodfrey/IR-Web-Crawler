Nonverbal communication From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Redirected from Non verbal  Jump to  navigation  search Hugs are a way for furs to say hello or goodbye  But in certain occasions  they can be used as a symbol of affection  or simply because a person felt like doing them  Nonverbal communication is usually understood as the process of communication through sending and receiving wordless  mostly visual  messages between people  Messages can be communicated through gestures and touch  by body language or posture  by facial expression and eye contact  Nonverbal messages could also be communicated through material exponential  meaning  objects or artifacts such as clothing  hairstyles or architecture   Speech contains nonverbal elements known as paralanguage  including voice quality  rate  pitch  volume  and speaking style  as well prosodic features such as rhythm  intonation  and stress  Likewise  written texts have nonverbal elements such as handwriting style  spatial arrangement of words  or the physical layout of a page  However  much of the study of nonverbal communication has focused on face to face interaction  where it can be classified into three principal areas  environmental conditions where communication takes place  physical characteristics of the communicators  and behaviors of communicators during interaction  Contents 1 Importance 2 The

communication with patients  Most social psychologists will tell you that nonverbal communication makes up about two thirds of all communication between two people or between one speaker and a group of listeners   1  Nonverbal communication can portray a message both verbally and with the correct body signals   There are numerous elements of what we call body language  They include physical features  both changeable and unchangeable  your gestures and signals you send to others at a conscience and unconscious level  and the space that you use when communicating with others   1  The wrong message can be established if the body language conveyed does not match a verbal message  Nonverbal communication strengthens a first impression in common situations like attracting a partner or in a business interview   You have less than ten seconds and realistically close to four seconds to make a good impression on those with whom you come in contact   1  First encounters or interactions with another person strongly affect a person s lifestyle   People are more likely to believe that the first things they learn are the truth   2  When the other person or group is absorbing the message they are focused on the entire environment around them  meaning  the other person uses all five senses in the interaction   Sight makes up 83  of the impact on the brain of information from the senses during a visual presentation  Taste makes up 1   Hearing makes up 11   smell 3  and touch 2    3   edit  The Study   Recent psychological research has revealed that college students who look at a two second video clip of a professor teaching can predict how students who spend an entire semester with that professor will like the professor by the end of the semester   1  In concluding this study  students who rated the professor as highly likeable from a first impression only found the class much more enjoyable throughout the semester versus the students who did not   edit  History The first scientific study of nonverbal communication was Charles Darwin s book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals  3  He argued that all mammals reliably show emotion in their faces  Seventy years later Silvan Tomkins  1911 1991  began his classic studies on human emotions in Affects Imagery Consciousness volumes 1 4  Rudolf Laban  1879 1958  and Warren Lamb  1923   raised body movement analysis in the world of dance to a high level  Studies now range across a number of fields  including  linguistics  semiotics and social psychology  Another large influence in nonverbal communication was Birdwhistell    Anthropologist Ray Birdwhistell pioneered the original study of nonverbal communication what he called  kinesics   He estimated that the average person actually speaks words for a total of about ten or eleven minutes a day and that the average sentence takes only about 2 5 seconds  Birdwhistell also estimated we can make and recognize around 250 000 facial expressions   3   edit  Posture Posture or a person s bodily stance communicates a variety of messages  Posture can be used to determine a participant s degree of attention or involvement  the difference in status between communicators  and the level of fondness a person has for the other communicator  depending on body  openness   5  Studies investigating the impact of posture on interpersonal relationships suggest that mirror image congruent postures  where one person s left side is parallel to the other person s right side  leads to favorable perception of communicators and positive speech  a person who displays a forward lean or decreases a backward lean also signifies positive sentiment during communication  6  There are many different types of posture  Some of these postures include  slouching  towering  legs spread  jaw thrust  shoulders forward  and arm crossing  These nonverbal behaviors can indicate feelings and attitudes toward another person  An example of good posture includes standing erect  and leaning forward communicates to a person that you are approachable  receptive  and friendly  A person talking to someone that is constantly looking at the floor or ceiling makes it seem as though disinterest with the conversation  Always try to avoid negative posture   Lean forward when listening  stand straight when speaking   3  Posture can be situation relative   A nineteen year old college student from New York will use different postures than a Mid western housewife  and a construction worker in the state of Washington will use different postures than a salesman in Chicago 4  Another example of posture being situational on more of a daily basis can be described in Driver s book   Four situational norms of posture would be  Flirting  where the norm is 60  eye contact  Job Interview with a relaxed and open body language  Business Negotiation where the norm is leaning back while steeping and Buying a Car where most have hands on hips with feet more than ten inches apart   5   edit  Clothing Clothing is the most common form of non verbal communication  The types of clothing that an individual wears convey nonverbal clues about his or her personality  background and financial status  and how others will respond to them  for instance   Miniskirts can give a woman the appearance that she is not approachable   3  This demonstrates a certain response  in this case  a negative and unapproachable response  simply via appearance  It is important to understand that their exterior and demeanor influence how others will react to them  An individual s clothing style can demonstrate their culture  mood  level of confidence  interests  age  authority  value beliefs  and their sexual identity  Some examples of a person s clothing type in which a negative message is being conveyed could include the following  A person with a sloppy appearance  messy hair  and wrinkled clothes sends the message   I don t care   Also  a woman who wears a tight dress with a low cut neckline may convey the message  I m attractive and sexy  or  Want to come back to my place tonight   By showing the positive aspects of his or her self through dress attire and grooming  one can inspire confidence in his or her abilities  Nonverbal elements such as physique  height  weight  hair  skin color  gender  odors  and clothing send nonverbal messages during interaction  For example  a study  2  carried out in Vienna  Austria  of the clothing worn by women attending discotheques showed that in certain groups of women  especially women who were without their partners   motivation for sex and levels of sexual hormones were correlated with aspects of their clothing  especially the amount of skin displayed and the presence of sheer clothing  Thus  to some degree  clothing sends signals about interest in courtship   edit  Gestures Gestures may be made with the hands  arms or body  and also include movements of the head  face and eyes  such as winking  nodding  or rolling one s eyes  Although the study of gesture is still in its infancy  some broad categories of gestures have been identified by researchers  The most familiar are the so called emblems or quotable gestures  These are conventional  culture specific gestures that can be used as replacement for words  such as the hand wave used in western cultures for  hello  and  goodbye   A single emblematic gesture can have a very different significance in different cultural contexts  ranging from complimentary to highly offensive  9  For a list of emblematic gestures  see List of gestures  There are some universal gestures like the shoulder shrug   The shoulder shrug is a good example of a universal gesture that is used to show that a person doesn t know or doesn t understand what you are saying  It s a multiple gesture that has three main parts  exposed palms to show nothing is being concealed in the hands  hunched shoulders to protect the throat from attack  and raised brow  which is a universal  submissive greeting  3  Gestures can also be categorized as either speech independent or speech related  Speech independent gestures are dependent upon culturally accepted interpretation and have a direct verbal translation  7  A wave or a  V sign  peace sign  are examples of speech independent gestures  Speech related gestures are used in parallel with verbal speech  this form of nonverbal communication is used to emphasize the message that is being communicated  Speech related gestures are intended to provide supplemental information to a verbal message such as pointing to an object of discussion   edit  Engagement Information about the relationship and affect of these two skaters is communicated by their body posture  eye gaze and physical contact  Eye contact is the primary notion to where a message of attention is being conveyed in engagement with Nonverbal communication  Eye contact is when two people look at each other s eyes at the same time  it can indicate interest  attention  and involvement  Studies have found that people use their eyes to indicate their interest and not just with the frequently recognized actions of winking and movements of the eyebrows  but it can indicate social behavior  Men and women have different ways of eye contact  Men stare at the women they are interested in for at least a half an hour  whereas women tend to always keep their eyes roaming around the room to see who is there  Disinterest is highly noticeable when showing little eye contact in a social setting  Pupils dilate when they are interested in the other person  People  sometimes  even  without consciously doing so  probe each other s eyes and faces for positive or negative mood signs  Generally speaking  the longer the eye contact between two people the greater the intimacy is felt inside 1  According to Eckman  Eye contact  also called mutual gaze  is another major channel of nonverbal communication  The duration of eye contact is its most meaningful aspect   6  Gaze comprises the actions of looking while talking and listening  The length of a gaze  the frequency of glances  patterns of fixation  pupil dilation  and blink rate are all important cues in nonverbal communication  10   Liking generally increases as mutual gazing increases    8  1  Along with the detection of disinterest  deceit can also be observed in a person  Hogan states  when someone is being deceptive their eyes tend to blink a lot more  Eyes act as leading indicator of truth or deception   1  Eye aversion is the avoidance of eye contact  Eye contact and facial expressions provide important social and emotional information  Overall  as Pease states   Give the amount of eye contact that makes everyone feel comfortable  Unless looking at others is a cultural no no  lookers gain more credibility than non lookers  3  In concealing deception  nonverbal communication makes it easier to lie without being revealed  This is the conclusion of a study where people watched made up interviews of persons accused of having stolen a wallet  The interviewees lied in about 50  of the cases  People had access to either written transcript of the interviews  or audio tape recordings  or video recordings  The more clues that were available to those watching  the larger was the trend that interviewees who actually lied were judged to be truthful  That is  people that are clever at lying can use voice tone and face expression to give the impression that they are truthful  15  However  there are many cited examples of cues to deceit  16 delivered via nonverbal  Para verbal and visual  communication channels  through which deceivers supposedly unwittingly provide clues to their concealed knowledge or actual opinions  Most studies examining the nonverbal cues to deceit rely upon human coding of video footage  c f  Vrij  2008 17    although a recent study also demonstrated bodily movement differences between truth tellers and liars using an automated body motion capture system 18  Deceit also involves distress  One recent study set out to find how well people could communicate distress signals non verbally  The research shows that you can identify certain social cues that can help you to predict that person s behavior  This is not always true though  The cues depend on the mindset of the person and cannot be predicted  The study was able to find 55 identifiable distress cues  42   edit  Genetics  In the study of nonverbal communications  the limbic brain is where the action is because it is the part of the brain that reacts to the world around us reflexively and instantaneously  in real time  and without thought   7  Genetics is a harder field to study in dealing with Nonverbal Communication  but there is evidence that the nonverbal cues made from person to person do not entirely have something to do with environment   When you cross your arms on your chest  do you cross left over right or right over left    Seven out of ten people cross their left arm over their right Evidence suggests that this may well be a genetic gesture that cannot be changed   3  So how is it studied in an entirely environmentally free environment   Evidence has been collected from observation of blind people  who could not have learned nonverbal signals through a visual channel    3  Other than gestures  phenotypic traits can also convey certain messages in nonverbal communication  for instance  eye color  hair color and height  Research into height has generally found that taller people are perceived as being more impressive  Melamed and Bozionelos  1992  studied a sample of managers in the United Kingdom and found that height was a key factor in who was promoted  Height can have benefits and depressors too   Being tall  however  is not always a bonus  While tall people often command more respect than short people  height can also be detrimental to some aspects of one to one communication  for instance  where you need to  talk on the same level  or have an  eye to eye  discussion with another person and do not want to be perceived as too big for your boots   3   edit  Proxemics  Physical Space in Communication When you are talking to someone stay out of their   intimate space  they want to talk to you but just do not want to have you all over them    Most animals have a certain air space around their bodies that they claim as their personal space 1 18 in being the intimate zone  18 48 in being the personal zone  4 12 ft  being the social zone and the public zone at over 12 ft   3  Proxemics is the study of how people use and perceive the physical space around them  The space between the sender and the receiver of a message influences the way the message is interpreted  In addition  the perception and use of space varies significantly across cultures 8  and different settings within cultures  Space in nonverbal communication may be divided into four main categories  intimate  social  personal  and public space  The term territoriality is used in the study of proxemics to explain human behavior regarding personal space  9  Hargie  amp  Dickson  2004  p  69  identify 4 such territories  Primary territory  This refers to an area that is associated with someone who has exclusive use of it  An example is a house that others cannot enter without the owner s permission  Secondary territory  Unlike primary territory  there is no  right  to occupancy of secondary territory  but people may still feel some degree of ownership of such space as they develop the custom of occupying it  For example  someone may sit in the same seat in church every week and feel irritated if someone else sits there  Public territory  this refers to an area that is available to all  but only for a set period  such as a parking space or a seat in a library  Although people have only a limited claim over that space  they often extend that claim  For example  it was found that people take longer to leave a parking space when someone is waiting to take that space  Interaction territory  this is space held by others when they are interacting  For example  when a group is talking to each other on a footpath  others will walk around the group rather than disturb their interaction territory   edit  Chronemics  time in communication Chronemics is the study of the use of time in nonverbal communication  The way we perceive time  structure our time and react to time is a powerful communication tool and helps set the stage for communication  Time perceptions include punctuality and the willingness to wait  plus the speed of speech and how long people are willing to listen  The timing and frequency of an action as well as the tempo and rhythm of communications within an interaction contributes to the interpretation of nonverbal messages  Gudykunst  amp  Ting Toomey  1988  identified two dominant time patterns  monochronic time and polychronic time   edit  Monochronic Time A monochronic time system means that things are done one at a time and time is segmented into precise  small units  Under this system time is scheduled  arranged and managed  The United States is considered a monochronic society  This perception of time is learned and rooted in the Industrial Revolution  where  factory life required the labor force to be on hand and in place at an appointed hour   Guerrero  DeVito  amp  Hecht  1999  p  238   For Americans  time is a precious resource not to be wasted or taken lightly   We buy time  save time  spend time and make time  Our time can be broken down into years  months  days  hours  minutes  seconds and even milliseconds  We use time to structure both our daily lives and events that we are planning for the future  We have schedules that we must follow  appointments that we must go to at a certain time  classes that start and end at certain times  work schedules that start and end at certain times  and even our favorite TV shows  that start and end at a certain time   As communication scholar Edward T  Hall wrote regarding the American viewpoint of time in the business world   the schedule is sacred   Hall says that for monochronic cultures   time is tangible  and viewed as a commodity where  time is money  or  time is wasted   The result of this perspective is that Americans and other monochronic cultures  such as the German and Swiss  place a paramount value on schedules  tasks and  getting the job done   These cultures are committed to regimented schedules and may view those who do not subscribe to the same perception of time as disrespectful  Monochronic cultures include Germany  Canada  Switzerland  the United States  and Scandinavia   edit  Polychronic Time A polychronic time system is a system where several things can be done at once  and a more fluid approach is taken to scheduling time  Unlike Americans and most northern and western European cultures  Native American  Latin American  Arab and African cultures use the polychronic system of time  These cultures are much less focused on the preciseness of accounting for each and every moment  As Raymond Cohen notes  polychronic cultures are deeply steeped in tradition rather than in tasks a clear difference from their monochronic counterparts  Cohen notes that  Traditional societies have all the time in the world  The arbitrary divisions of the clock face have little saliency in cultures grounded in the cycle of the seasons  the invariant pattern of rural life  and the calendar of religious festivities   Cohen  1997  p  34   Instead  their culture is more focused on relationships  rather than watching the clock  They have no problem being  late  for an event if they are with family or friends  because the relationship is what really matters  As a result  polychronic cultures have a much less formal perception of time  They are not ruled by precise calendars and schedules  Rather   cultures that use the polychronic time system often schedule multiple appointments simultaneously so keeping on schedule is an impossibility    2  Polychronic cultures include Saudi Arabia  Egypt  Mexico  the Philippines  India  and many in Africa   edit  Movement and body position  edit  Kinesics The term  kinesics  was first used  in 1952  by Ray Birdwhistell  an anthropologist who wished to study how people communicate through posture  gesture  stance  and movement  Part of Birdwhistell s work involved making films of people in social situations and analyzing them to show different levels of communication not clearly seen otherwise  Several other anthropologists  including Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson  also studied kinesics   edit  Haptics  touching in communication A high five is an example of communicative touch  Haptics is the study of touching as nonverbal communication  and haptic communication refers to how people and other animals communicate via touching  Touches among humans that can be defined as communication include handshakes  holding hands  kissing  cheek  lips  hand   back slapping  high fives  a pat on the shoulder  and brushing an arm  Touching of oneself may include licking  picking  holding  and scratching  10  These behaviors are referred to as  adapters  or  tells  and may send messages that reveal the intentions or feelings of a communicator  The meaning conveyed from touch is highly dependent upon the culture  the context of the situation  the relationship between communicators  and the manner of touch  11  Touch is an extremely important sense for humans  as well as providing information about surfaces and textures it is a component of nonverbal communication in interpersonal relationships  and vital in conveying physical intimacy  It can be both sexual  such as kissing  and platonic  such as hugging or tickling   Touch is the earliest sense to develop in the fetus  The development of an infant s haptic senses and how it relates to the development of the other senses such as vision have been the target of much research  Human babies have been observed to have enormous difficulty surviving if they do not possess a sense of touch  even if they retain sight and hearing  Babies who can perceive through touch  even without sight and hearing  tend to fare much better  Touch can be thought of as a basic sense in that most life forms have a response to being touched  while only a subset have sight and hearing  In chimpanzees the sense of touch is highly developed  As newborns they see and hear poorly but cling strongly to their mothers  Harry Harlow conducted a controversial study involving rhesus monkeys and observed that monkeys reared with a  terry cloth mother   a wire feeding apparatus wrapped in soft terry cloth that provided a level of tactile stimulation and comfort  were considerably more emotionally stable as adults than those with a mere wire mother  Harlow 1958  Touching is treated differently from one country to another and socially acceptable levels of touching vary from one culture to another  Remland  2009   In Thai culture  for example  touching someone s head may be thought rude  Remland and Jones  1995  studied groups of people communicating and found that touching was rare among the English  8    the French  5   and the Dutch  4   compared to Italians  14   and Greeks  12 5    12  Striking  pushing  pulling  pinching  kicking  strangling and hand to hand fighting are forms of touch in the context of physical abuse  In a sentence like  I never touched him her  or  Don t you dare touch him her   the term touch may be meant as a euphemism for either physical abuse or sexual touching  To  touch oneself  is a euphemism for masturbation  Stoeltje  2003  wrote about how Americans are  losing touch  with this important communication skill  During a study conducted by University of Miami School of Medicine  Touch Research Institutes  American children were said to be more aggressive than their French counterparts while playing at a playground  It was noted that French women touched their children more   edit  Functions of nonverbal communication Argyle  1970  13  put forward the hypothesis that whereas spoken language is normally used for communicating information about events external to the speakers  non verbal codes are used to establish and maintain interpersonal relationships  It is considered more polite or nicer to communicate attitudes towards others non verbally rather than verbally  for instance in order to avoid embarrassing situations  14  Argyle  1988  concluded there are five primary functions of nonverbal bodily behavior in human communication  15  Express emotions Express interpersonal attitudes To accompany speech in managing the cues of interaction between speakers and listeners Self presentation of one s personality Rituals  greetings  In regards to expressing interpersonal attitudes  humans communicate interpersonal closeness through a series of nonverbal actions known as immediacy behaviors  Examples of immediacy behaviors are smiling  touching  open body positions  and eye contact  Cultures that display these immediacy behaviors are considered high contact cultures   edit  Criticism An interesting question is  When two people are communicating face to face  how much of the meaning is communicated verbally  and how much is communicated non verbally  This was investigated by Albert Mehrabian and reported in two papers  16  17  The latter paper concluded   It is suggested that the combined effect of simultaneous verbal  vocal  and facial attitude communications is a weighted sum of their independent effects   with coefficients of  07   38  and  55  respectively   This  rule  that clues from spoken words  from the voice tone  and from the facial expression  contribute 7    38    and 55   respectively to the total meaning  is widely cited  It is presented on all types of popular courses with statements like  scientists have found out that          In reality  however  it is extremely weakly founded  First  it is based on the judgment of the meaning of single tape recorded words  i e  a very artificial context  Second  the figures are obtained by combining results from two different studies which potentially cannot be combined  Third  it relates only to the communication of positive versus negative emotions  Fourth  it relates only to women  as men did not participate in the study  Since then  other studies have analysed the relative contribution of verbal and nonverbal signals under more naturalistic situations  Argyle  13  using video tapes shown to the subjects  analysed the communication of submissive dominant attitude and found that non verbal cues had 4 3 times the effect of verbal cues  The most important effect was that body posture communicated superior status in a very efficient way  On the other hand  a study by Hsee et al  18  had subjects judge a person on the dimension happy sad and found that words spoken with minimal variation in intonation had an impact about 4 times larger than face expressions seen in a film without sound  Thus  the relative importance of spoken words and facial expressions may be very different in studies using different set ups   edit  Interaction of verbal and nonverbal communication When communicating  nonverbal messages can interact with verbal messages in six ways  repeating  conflicting  complementing  substituting  regulating and accenting moderating  Conflicting Verbal and nonverbal messages within the same interaction can sometimes send opposing or conflicting messages  A person verbally expressing a statement of truth while simultaneously fidgeting or avoiding eye contact may convey a mixed message to the receiver in the interaction  Conflicting messages may occur for a variety of reasons often stemming from feelings of uncertainty  ambivalence  or frustration  23 When mixed messages occur  nonverbal communication becomes the primary tool people use to attain additional information to clarify the situation  great attention is placed on bodily movements and positioning when people perceive mixed messages during interactions  edit  Complementing Accurate interpretation of messages is made easier when nonverbal and verbal communication complement each other  Nonverbal cues can be used to elaborate on verbal messages to reinforce the information sent when trying to achieve communicative goals  messages have been shown to be remembered better when nonverbal signals affirm the verbal exchange  19   edit  Substituting Nonverbal behavior is sometimes used as the sole channel for communication of a message  People learn to identify facial expressions  body movements  and body positioning as corresponding with specific feelings and intentions  Nonverbal signals can be used without verbal communication to convey messages  when nonverbal behavior does not effectively communicate a message  verbal methods are used to enhance understanding  20   edit  Clinical studies of nonverbal communication From 1977 to 2004  the influence of disease and drugs on receptivity of nonverbal communication was studied by teams at three separate medical schools using a similar paradigm  21  Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh  Yale University and Ohio State University had subjects observe gamblers at a slot machine awaiting payoffs  The amount of this payoff was read by nonverbal transmission prior to reinforcement  This technique was developed by and the studies directed by psychologist  Dr  Robert E  Miller and psychiatrist  Dr  A  James Giannini  These groups reported diminished receptive ability in heroin addicts 22  and phencyclidine abusers 23  was contrasted with increased receptivity in cocaine addicts  Men with major depression 24  manifested significantly decreased ability to read nonverbal cues when compared with euthymic men  In some subjects tested for ability to read nonverbal cues  intuitive paradigms were apparently employed while in others a cause and effect approach was used  25  Subjects in the former group answered quickly and before reinforcement occurred  They could not give a rationale for their particular responses  Subjects in the latter category delayed their response and could offer reasons for their choice The level of accuracy between the two groups did not vary nor did handedness  26  Freitas Magalhaes studied the effect of smile in the treatment of depression and concluded that depressive states decrease when you smile more often  27  Obese women 28  and women with premenstrual syndrome 29  were found to also possess diminished abilities to read these cues  In contradistinction  men with bipolar disorder possessed increased abilities  30  A woman with total paralysis of the nerves of facial expression was found unable to transmit or receive any nonverbal facial cues whatsoever  31  Because of the changes in levels of accuracy on the levels of nonverbal receptivity  the members of the research team hypothesized a biochemical site in the brain which was operative for reception of nonverbal cues  Because certain drugs enhanced ability while others diminished it  the neurotransmitters dopamine and endorphin were considered to be likely etiological candidate  Based on the available data  however  the primary cause and primary effect could not be sorted out on the basis of the paradigm employed  32  A byproduct of the work of the Pittsburgh Yale  Ohio State team was an investigation of the role of nonverbal facial cues in heterosexual nondate rape  Males who were serial rapists of adult women were studied for nonverbal receptive abilities  Their scores were the highest of any subgroup  33  Rape victims were next tested  It was reported that women who had been raped on at least two occasions by different perpetrators had a highly significant impairment in their abilities to read these cues in either male or female senders  34  These results were troubling  indicating a predator prey model  The authors did note that whatever the nature of these preliminary findings the responsibility of the rapist was in no manner or level  diminished  The final target of study for this group was the medical students they taught  Medical students at Ohio State University  Ohio University and Northest Ohio Medical College were invited to serve as subjects  Students indicating a preference for the specialties of family practice  psychiatry  pediatrics and obstetrics gynecology achieved significantly higher levels of accuracy than those students who planned to train as surgeons  radiologists  or pathologists  Internal medicine and plastic surgery candidates scored at levels near the mean  35   edit  Conclusion Nonverbal communication is the process of sending and receiving messages from another person  These messages can be conveyed through gestures  engagement  posture  and even clothing and hygiene  Nonverbal communication can convey a very different message than a verbal conversation  This can tell someone whether they are likes  interesting or hated  Nonverbal communication can have meanings in objects as well  Certain articles in a person s life can say a lot about them and can sometimes even talk for them  A person s handwriting can also tell a lot about the way they can communicate with others  Nonverbal communication can be easiest practiced when the two communicators are face to face  The nonverbal aspect of communication is easiest when the environment is right for all communicators involved  such as  when the environment is right or the moment is right  Nonverbal communication is an important aspect in any conversation skill people are practicing  Nonverbal communication will inhibit someone to be able to tell other person how hey are really feeling without having to voice any opinions  People can interpret body signals better than they can talk most of the time   edit  Footnotes   a b c d e f g Hogan  K   Stubbs  R   2003   Can t get Through 8 Barriers to Communication  Grenta  LA
