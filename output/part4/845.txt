Beat Generation From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search The Beat Generation was a group of American post World War II writers who came to prominence in the 1950s  as well as the cultural phenomena that they both documented and inspired  Central elements of  Beat  culture included experimentation with drugs  alternative forms of sexuality  an interest in Eastern religion  a rejection of materialism  and the idealizing of exuberant  unexpurgated means of expression and being  Allen Ginsberg s Howl  1956   William S  Burroughs s Naked Lunch  1959  and Jack Kerouac s On the Road  1957  are among the best known examples of Beat literature  1  Both Howl and Naked Lunch were the focus of obscenity trials that ultimately helped to liberalize publishing in the United States  2  3  The members of the Beat Generation developed a reputation as new bohemian hedonists  who celebrated non conformity and spontaneous creativity  The original  Beat Generation  writers met in New York  Later  in the mid 1950s  the central figures  with the exception of Burroughs  ended up together in San Francisco where they met and became friends with figures associated with the San Francisco Renaissance  In the 1960s  elements of the expanding Beat movement were incorporated into the Hippie counterculture  Contents 1 Significant figures  events  and elements 1 1 Origin of name 1

1948 to characterize a perceived underground  anti conformist youth movement in New York  The name arose in a conversation with writer John Clellon Holmes  The adjective  beat  could colloquially mean  tired  or  beaten down   4  5  but Kerouac expanded the meaning to include the connotations  upbeat    beatific   and the musical association of being  on the beat   6   edit  Columbia University The origins of the Beat Generation can be traced to Columbia University and the meeting of Kerouac  Ginsberg  Lucien Carr  Hal Chase and others  Though the beats are usually regarded as anti academic  7  8  9  many of their ideas were formed in response to professors like Lionel Trilling and Mark Van Doren  Classmates Carr and Ginsberg discussed the need for a  New Vision   a term borrowed from Arthur Rimbaud   to counteract what they perceived as their teachers  conservative  formalistic literary ideals  Burroughs was introduced to the group by an old friend  David Kammerer  who was enamored with Lucien Carr  Carr had befriended freshman Allen Ginsberg and introduced him to Kammerer and Burroughs  Carr also knew Kerouac s girlfriend Edie Parker  through whom Burroughs met Kerouac in 1944  On August 13  1944  Carr killed Kammerer with a Boy Scout knife in Riverside Park in what he claimed later was self defense  10  He waited  citation needed  then dumped the body in the Hudson River  later seeking advice from Burroughs  who suggested he turn himself in  He then went to Kerouac  who helped him dispose of the weapon  Carr turned himself in the following morning and later pleaded guilty to manslaughter  Kerouac was charged as an accessory  and Burroughs as a material witness  but neither was prosecuted  Kerouac wrote about this incident twice in his own works  once in his first novel  The Town and the City  and again in one of his last  Vanity of Duluoz  He wrote a collaboration novel with Burroughs   And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks   concerning the murder   edit  The Times Square  Underworld  Burroughs had an interest in criminal behavior and got involved in dealing stolen goods and narcotics  He was soon addicted to opiates  Burroughs  guide to the criminal underworld  centered in particular around Times Square  was small time criminal and drug addict Herbert Huncke  The Beats were drawn to Huncke  who later started to write himself  perceiving he possessed a vital worldly knowledge unavailable to them from their largely middle class upbringings  Ginsberg was arrested in 1949  The police attempted to pull over Ginsberg while he was driving with Huncke  his car filled with stolen items Huncke planned to fence  Ginsberg crashed the car while trying to flee  He escaped on foot  but left incriminating notebooks behind  Ginsberg was given the option to plead insanity to avoid a jail term  and was committed for 90 days to Bellevue Hospital  where he met Carl Solomon  11  Carl Solomon was arguably more eccentric than psychotic  A fan of Antonin Artaud  he indulged in self consciously  crazy  behavior  like throwing potato salad at a college lecturer on Dadaism  Solomon was given shock treatments at Bellevue  this became one of the main themes of Ginsberg s  Howl   which was dedicated to Solomon  Solomon later became the publishing contact who agreed to publish Burroughs  first novel Junky in 1953  12   edit  Neal Cassady Neal Cassady was introduced to the group in 1947  and had a number of significant effects  Cassady became something of a muse to Ginsberg  they had a romantic affair  and Ginsberg became Cassady s personal writing tutor  Kerouac s road trips with Cassady in the late 1940s became the focus of his second novel  On the Road  Cassady s verbal style is one of the sources of the spontaneous  jazz inspired rapping that later became associated with  beatniks   Cassady impressed the group with the free flowing style of his letters  and Kerouac cited them as a key influence on his spontaneous prose style   edit  San Francisco and the Six Gallery reading See also  San Francisco Renaissance Allen Ginsberg had visited Neal and Carolyn Cassady in San Jose  California in 1954 and moved on to San Francisco in August  He fell in love with Peter Orlovsky at the end of 1954 and began writing Howl  Lawrence Ferlinghetti  of the new City Lights Bookstore started to publish the City Lights Pocket Poets Series in 1955  Kenneth Rexroth s apartment became a Friday night literary salon  Ginsberg s mentor William Carlos Williams  an old friend of Rexroth s  had given him an introductory letter   When asked by Wally Hedrick  13  to organize the Six Gallery reading  Ginsberg wanted Rexroth to serve as master of ceremonies  in a sense to bridge generations  Philip Lamantia  Michael McClure  Philip Whalen  Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder read on October 7  1955  before 100 people  including Kerouac  up from Mexico City   Lamantia read poems of his late friend John Hoffman  At his first public reading Ginsberg performed the just finished first part of Howl  It was a success and the evening led to many more readings by the now locally famous Six Gallery poets  It was also a marker of the beginning of the Beat movement  since the 1956 publication of Howl  City Lights Pocket Poets  no  4  and its obscenity trial in 1957 brought it to nationwide attention  14  15  The Six Gallery reading informs the second chapter of Kerouac s 1958 novel The Dharma Bums  whose chief protagonist is  Japhy Ryder   Kerouac s roman   clef for Gary Snyder  Kerouac was impressed with Snyder and they were close for a number of years  In the spring of 1955 they lived together in Snyder s Mill Valley cabin  Most Beats were urbanites and they found Snyder almost exotic  with his rural background and wilderness experience  as well as his education in cultural anthropology and Oriental languages  Lawrence Ferlinghetti called him  the Thoreau of the Beat Generation   As documented in the conclusion of the The Dharma Bums  Snyder moved to Japan in 1955  in large measure in order to intensively practice and study Zen Buddhism  He would spend most of the next 10 years there  Buddhism is one of the primary subjects of The Dharma Bums  and the book undoubtedly helped to popularize Buddhism in the West and remains one of Kerouac s most widely read books  16   edit  Women of the Beat Generation The female contemporaries of Kerouac  Ginsberg and Burroughs were intimately involved in the creation of Beat philosophy and literature  and yet remain markedly absent from the mainstream interpretation of the most important aspects and figures of the movement  Further  the Beat writings of Kerouac  Ginsberg and Burroughs often portray female characters in flat  traditional gender roles most typical of an ideal 1950s American housewife  Rather than offering liberation from social norms  Beat culture actually often marginalized and further culturally repressed American women and  more specifically  many of the female writers of the time period   17  Although women are less acknowledged in histories of the first Beat Generation  the omission may be due more to the period s sexism than the reality  18 Joan Vollmer for instance did not write  although she appears as a minor figure in multiple authors  works  19  She has become legendary as the wife of William S  Burroughs  documented in Kerouac s novels  and killed by Burroughs in a drunken game of William Tell  20  Corso and Diane Di Prima  among others  insist that there were female Beats  but that it was more difficult for women to get away with a Bohemian existence in that era  21  22  Notable Beat Generation women who have been published include Joyce Johnson  Carolyn Cassady  Hettie Jones  Joanne Kyger  Harriet Sohmers Zwerling  Bonnie Bremser  Diane DiPrima  and Ruth Weiss  who also made films  Poet Elise Cowen took her life in 1963  Later  women emerged who claimed to be strongly influenced by the Beats  including Janine Pommy Vega in the 1960s  Patti Smith in the 1970s  and Hedwig Gorski in the 1980s  23   edit  Drug use The original members of the Beat Generation used a number of different drugs  including alcohol  marijuana  benzedrine  morphine  and later psychedelic drugs including peyote  yage  and LSD  Much of this usage was  experimental   in that they were often initially unfamiliar with the effects of these drugs  They were inspired by intellectual interest  as well as simple hedonism  The actual results of this  experimentation  can be difficult to determine  Claims that some of these drugs can enhance creativity  insight or productivity were quite common  as is the belief that the drugs in use were a key influence on the social events of the time  see recreational drug use   24   edit  Sexuality Many of the key Beat Generation figures were homosexual or bisexual  some of them quite openly  including two of the most prominent writers  Ginsberg and Burroughs   Many of them met each other through homosexual social connections  specifically David Kammerer s interest in Lucien Carr  One of the contentious features of Ginsberg s poem Howl for authorities were lines about homosexual sex  William Burroughs  Naked Lunch focuses on drug use  but also contains sexual content  In addition to references to homosexuality  it included explicit descriptions of alternative sexual practices  Both works were prosecuted for obscenity  Victory by the publishers in both cases in effect marked the end of literary censorship in the United States  2  3  In comparison  though considered racy at the time  Kerouac s writings were relatively mild  On the Road mentions Neal Cassady s bisexuality without comment  while Visions of Cody confronts it  However  the first novel does show Cassady as frankly promiscuous  Kerouac s novels feature an interracial love affair  The Subterraneans   and group sex  The Dharma Bums    edit  Influences  edit  Romanticism Gregory Corso worshiped Percy Bysshe Shelley as a hero and was buried at the foot of Shelley s Grave in the Protestant Cemetery  Rome  Ginsberg mentions Shelley s Adonais at the beginning of Kaddish  and cites it as a major influence on the composition of one of his most important poems  Michael McClure compared Ginsberg s Howl to Shelley s breakthrough poem Queen Mab  25  Ginsberg s most important Romantic influence was William Blake  26  Blake was the subject of Ginsberg s self defining auditory hallucination and revelation in 1948  27  Ginsberg would study Blake all his life  The first time Michael McClure met Ginsberg  they talked about Blake  McClure saw him as a revolutionary  Ginsberg saw him as a prophet  citation needed John Keats was also cited as an influence   edit  Early American sources Important American inspirations for the Beats included Henry David Thoreau  Ralph Waldo Emerson  Herman Melville and especially Walt Whitman  who is addressed as the subject of one of Ginsberg s most famous poems   A Supermarket in California    Edgar Allan Poe is occasionally acknowledged  and Ginsberg claimed Emily Dickinson was an influence on Beat poetry  The novel You Can t Win by Jack Black had a strong influence on Burroughs  28   edit  French Surrealism Surrealism was still in many ways a vital movement in the 1950s  Carl Solomon introduced the work of Antonin Artaud to Ginsberg  and the poetry of Andr  Breton had direct influence on the poem Kaddish  citation needed  Rexroth  Ferlinghetti  John Ashbery and Ron Padgett translated French poetry  Second generation Beat Ted Joans was named  the only Afro American Surrealist  by Breton  29  Philip Lamantia introduced surrealist poetry to the original Beats  30  The poetry of Gregory Corso and Bob Kaufman shows the influence of Surrealist poetry with its dream like images and its random juxtaposition of dissociated images  citation needed  and this influence can also be seen in more subtle ways in Ginsberg s poetry  citation needed  As the legend goes  when meeting Marcel Duchamp Ginsberg kissed his shoe and Corso cut off his tie  31  page needed  Other shared Beat interests were Guillaume Apollinaire  Arthur Rimbaud and Charles Baudelaire  citation needed   edit  Modernism Though the Beat aesthetic posited itself against T  S  Eliot s creed of strict objectivity and literary modernism s new classicism  certain modernist poets were major influences on the Beats  including Ezra Pound  William Carlos Williams  and H D   Pound was specifically important to Gary Snyder and Allen Ginsberg  William Carlos Williams was an influence on many of the Beats  with his encouragement to speak with an American voice instead of imitating the European poetic voice and European forms  When Williams came to Reed College to give a lecture  then students Snyder  Whalen  and Welch were deeply impressed  Williams was a personal mentor to Ginsberg  both being from Paterson  New Jersey  Williams published several of Ginsberg s letters to him in his epic poem Paterson and wrote an introduction to two of Ginsberg s books  And many of the Beats  Ginsberg specifically  helped promote Williams  writing  Ferlinghetti s City Lights published a volume of his poetry  Gertrude Stein was subject of a book length study by Lew Welch  Admitted influences for Kerouac include Marcel Proust  Ernest Hemingway and Thomas Wolfe  32   edit  Influences on Western culture A section devoted to the beat generation at a bookstore in Stockholm  Sweden  While many authors claim to be directly influenced by the Beats  the Beat Generation phenomenon itself has had a pervasive influence on Western culture more broadly  citation needed  In 1982  Ginsberg published a summary of  the essential effects  of the Beat Generation  33  Spiritual liberation  sexual  revolution  or  liberation   i e   gay liberation  somewhat catalyzing women s liberation  black liberation  Gray Panther activism  Liberation of the world from censorship  Demystification and or decriminalization of cannabis and other drugs  The evolution of rhythm and blues into rock and roll as a high art form  as evidenced by the Beatles  Bob Dylan  and other popular musicians influenced in the later fifties and sixties by Beat generation poets  and writers  works  The spread of ecological consciousness  emphasized early on by Gary Snyder and Michael McClure  the notion of a  Fresh Planet   Opposition to the military industrial machine civilization  as emphasized in writings of Burroughs  Huncke  Ginsberg  and Kerouac  Attention to what Kerouac called  after Spengler  a  second religiousness  developing within an advanced civilization  Return to an appreciation of idiosyncrasy as against state regimentation  Respect for land and indigenous peoples and creatures  as proclaimed by Kerouac in his slogan from On the Road   The Earth is an Indian thing    edit  Counterculture effects  edit   Beatniks  Main article  Beatnik The term  Beatnik  was coined by Herb Caen of the San Francisco Chronicle on 2 April 1958  a portmanteau on the name of the recent Russian satellite Sputnik and Beat Generation  This suggested that beatniks were  1   far out of the mainstream of society  and  2   possibly pro Communist   34  Caen s term stuck and became the popular label associated with a new stereotype   the man with a goatee and beret reciting nonsensical poetry and playing bongo drums  while free spirited women wearing black leotards dance  An early example of the  beatnik stereotype  occurred in Vesuvio s  a bar in North Beach  which employed the artist Wally Hedrick to sit in the window dressed in full beard  turtleneck  and sandals  creating improvisational drawings and paintings  By 1958 tourists to San Francisco could take bus tours to view the North Beach Beat scene  prophetically anticipating similar tours of the Haight Ashbury district ten years later  35  A variety of other small businesses also sprang up exploiting  and or satirizing  the new craze  In 1959  Fred McDarrah started a  Rent a Beatnik  service in New York  taking out ads in The Village Voice and sending Ted Joans and friends out on calls to read poetry  36   Beatniks  appeared in many cartoons  movies  and TV shows of the time  perhaps the most famous being the character Maynard G  Krebs in The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis   1959 1963  While some of the original Beats embraced the beatniks  or at least found the parodies humorous  Ginsberg  for example  appreciated the parody in Pogo 37   others criticized the beatniks as inauthentic posers  Kerouac feared that the spiritual aspect of his message had been lost and that many were using the Beat Generation as an excuse to be senselessly wild  38   edit   Hippies  Main article  hippie During the 1950s  aspects of the Beat movement metamorphosed into the counterculture of the 1960s  accompanied by a shift in terminology from  beatnik  to  hippie   39  Many of the original Beats remained active participants  notably Allen Ginsberg  who became a fixture of the anti war movement  Notably  however  Jack Kerouac broke with Ginsberg and criticized the 1960s politically radical protest movements as an excuse to be  spiteful   40  There were stylistic differences between beatniks and hippies   somber colors  dark sunglasses  and goatees gave way to colorful psychedelic clothing and long hair  The beats were known for  playing it cool   keeping a low profile   41  but the hippies became known for  being cool   displaying their individuality   citation needed  Beyond style  there were changes in substance  The Beats tended to be essentially apolitical  but the hippies became actively engaged with the civil rights movement and the anti war movement  42   edit  Literary legacy Among the emerging novelists of the 1960s and 1970s  a few were closely connected with Beat writers  most notably Ken Kesey  One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest   Though they had no direct connection  other writers considered the Beats to be a major influence  including Thomas Pynchon  Gravity s Rainbow  43  and Tom Robbins  Even Cowgirls Get the Blues   William Burroughs is considered a forefather of postmodern literature  he also inspired the cyberpunk genre  44  45  46  One time Beat writer LeRoi Jones Amiri Baraka helped initiate the Black Arts movement  47  Since there was focus on live performance among the Beats  many Slam poets have claimed to be influenced by the Beats  Saul Williams  for example  cites Allen Ginsberg  Amiri Baraka  and Bob Kaufman as major influences  48  The Postbeat Poets are direct descendants of the Beat Generation  Their association with or tutelage under Ginsberg at The Naropa University s Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics 49  and later at Brooklyn College stressed the social activist legacy of the Beats and created its own body of literature  Known authors are Anne Waldman  Antler  poet   Andy Clausen  David Cope  Eileen Myles  Eliot Katz  Paul Beatty  Sapphire  author   Lesl a Newman  Jim Cohn  Thomas R  Peters  Jr  poet and owner of beat book shop   Sharon Mesmer  Randy Roark  Josh Smith  David Evans  citation needed   edit  Rock and pop music The Beats had a pervasive influence on rock and roll and popular music  including the Beatles  Bob Dylan and Jim Morrison  the Beatles spelled their name with an  a  partly as a Beat Generation reference  50  and Lennon was a fan of Jack Kerouac  51  Ginsberg later met and became friends with members of the Beatles  Paul McCartney played guitar on Ginsberg s album Ballad of the Skeletons  Ginsberg was close friends with Bob Dylan 52  and toured with him on the Rolling Thunder Revue in 1975  Dylan cites Ginsberg and Kerouac as major influences  Jim Morrison cites Kerouac as one of his biggest influences  and fellow Doors member Ray Manzarek has said  We wanted to be beatniks   53  In his book  Light My Fire  My Life with The Doors   Manzarek also writes  I suppose if Jack Kerouac had never written On the Road  The Doors would never have existed   Michael McClure was also friends with members of The Doors  at one point touring with keyboardist Ray Manzarek  Ginsberg was friends with Ken Kesey s Merry Pranksters  a group of which Cassady was a member  which also included members of the Grateful Dead  In the 1970s  Burroughs was friends with Mick Jagger  Lou Reed  and Patti Smith  British progressive rock band Soft Machine is named after Burroughs  novel The Soft Machine  Singer songwriter Tom Waits  a Beat fan  wrote  Jack and Neal  about Kerouac and Cassady  and recorded  On the Road   a song written by Kerouac after finishing the novel  with Primus  He later collaborated with Burroughs on the theatrical work The Black Rider  There was a resurgence of interest in the beats among bands in the 1980s  Ginsberg worked with the Clash  Burroughs worked with Sonic Youth  R E M   Kurt Cobain  and Ministry  amongst others  Bono of U2 cites Burroughs as a major influence  54  55  and Burroughs appeared briefly in a U2 video in 1997  56 Laurie Anderson featured Burroughs on her 1984 album Mister Heartbreak and in her 1986 concert film  Home of the Brave  King Crimson produced the album Beat inspired by the Beat Generation   edit  Criticism Norman Podhoretz  a student at Columbia with Kerouac and Ginsberg  later became a critic of the Beats  His 1958 Partisan Review article  The Know Nothing Bohemians   was a vehement critique primarily of Kerouac s On the Road and The Subterraneans  as well as Ginsberg s Howl  57  His central criticism is that the Beat embrace of spontaneity is bound up in an anti intellectual worship of the  primitive  that can easily turn toward mindlessness and violence  Podhoretz asserted that there was a link between the Beats and criminal delinquents  Ginsberg responded in a 1958 interview with The Village Voice  58  specifically addressing the charge that the Beats destroyed  the distinction between life and literature    The bit about anti intellectualism is a piece of vanity  we had the same education  went to the same school  you know there are  Intellectuals  and there are intellectuals  Podhoretz is just out of touch with twentieth century literature  he s writing for the eighteenth century mind  We have a personal literature now Proust  Wolfe  Faulkner  Joyce   59   edit  Internal criticism In a 1974 interview  60  Gary Snyder comments on the subject of  casualties  of the Beat Generation  61  Kerouac was a casualty too  And there were many other casualties that most people have never heard of  but were genuine casualties  Just as  in the 60s  when Allen and I for a period there were almost publicly recommending people to take acid  When I look back on that now I realize there were many casualties  responsibilities to bear   edit  The Beats comment on the Beat Generation  The so called Beat Generation was a whole bunch of people  of all different nationalities  who came to the conclusion that society sucked     Amiri Baraka citation needed  Three writers do not a generation make    Gregory Corso 62   sometimes also attributed to Gary Snyder    Beat means to have all the blather knocked out of you by experience  suddenly seeing things as they are  Beat doesn t mean a broken spirit  on the contrary  it s scourged of external blather     Gregory Corso citation needed   Nobody knows whether we were catalysts or invented something  or just the froth riding on a wave of its own  We were all three  I suppose     Allen Ginsberg 63   John Clellon Holmes    and I were sitting around trying to think up the meaning of the Lost Generation and the subsequent existentialism and I said  You know John  this is really a beat generation   and he leapt up and said   That s it  that s right      Jack Kerouac 64   But yet  but yet  woe  woe unto those who think that the Beat Generation means crime  delinquency  immorality  amorality     woe unto those who attack it on the grounds that they simply don t understand history and the yearning of human souls     woe in fact unto those who make evil movies about the Beat Generation where innocent housewives are raped by beatniks      woe unto those who spit on the Beat Generation  the wind ll blow it back     Jack Kerouac citation needed   edit  Films about the Beat Generation Jack Kerouac

edited by Arthur Winfield Knight       the next key point was Castro taking over Cuba  The apolitical quality of Beat thought changed with that  It sparked quite a discussion and quite a dialogue  many people had been basic pacifists with considerable disillusion with Marxian revolutionary rhetoric  At the time of Castro s victory  it had to be rethought again  Here was a revolution that had used violence and that was apparently a good thing  Many people abandoned the pacifist position at that time or at least began to give more thought to it  In any case  many people began to look to politics again as having possibilities  From that follows  at least on some levels  the beginning of civil rights activism  which leads through our one whole chain of events  the Movement  We had little confidence in our power to make any long range or significant changes  That was the 50s  you see  It seemed that bleak  So that our choices seemed entirely personal existential lifetime choices that there was no guarantee that we would have any audience  or anybody would listen to us  but it was a moral decision  a moral poetic decision  Then Castro changed things  then Martin Luther King
