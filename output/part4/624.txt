United States  also known as Hollywood  has had a profound effect on cinema across the world since the early 20th century  Its history is sometimes separated into four main periods  the silent film era  classical Hollywood cinema  New Hollywood  and the contemporary period  While the Lumiere Brothers are generally credited with the birth of modern cinema  it is undisputably American cinema that soon became the most dominant force in an emerging industry  Since the 1920s  the American film industry has grossed more money every year than that of any other country  In 1878  Eadweard Muybridge demonstrated the power of photography to capture motion  In 1894  the world s first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City  using Thomas Edison s Kinetoscope  The United States was in the forefront of sound film development in the following decades  Since the early 20th century  the U S  film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood  Los Angeles  California  Picture City  FL was also a planned site for a movie picture production center in the 1920s  but due to the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane  the idea collapsed and Picture City returned to its original name of Hobe Sound  Director D  W  Griffith was central to the development of film grammar  Orson Welles s Citizen Kane  1941  is frequently cited in critics  polls as the greatest film of all time  1  American screen actors like John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe have become iconic figures  while producer entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising  The major film studios of Hollywood are the primary source of the most commercially successful movies in the world  such as Gone with the Wind  1939   Star Wars  1977   Titanic  1997   and Avatar  2009   Today  American film studios collectively generate several hundred movies every year  making the United States the third most prolific producer of films in the world   the first being India and the second being Nigeria  2  Contents 1 History 1 1 Origins 1 2 Rise of Hollywood 1 3 Golden Age of Hollywood 1 4 Decline of the studio system 1 5 New Hollywood and post classical cinema 1 6 Rise of

second recorded instance of David capturing and reproducing motion was a series of photographs of a running horse by Eadweard Muybridge  which he captured in Palo Alto  California  using a set of still cameras placed in a row  Muybridge s accomplishment led inventors everywhere to attempt to make similar devices that would capture such motion  In the United States  Thomas Edison was among the first to produce such a device  the kinetoscope  whose heavy handed patent enforcement caused early filmmakers to look for alternatives  In the earliest days of the American film industry  New York played a role  The Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens  built during the silent film era  was used by the Marx Brothers and W C  Fields  Chelsea  Manhattan was also frequently used  Mary Pickford  an Academy Award winning actress  shot some of her early films in this area  Other major centers of film production also included Chicago  Florida  California  and Cuba  The film patents wars of the early 20th century led to the spread of film companies across the U S  Many worked with equipment for which they did not own the rights  and thus filming in New York could be dangerous  it was close to Edison s Company headquarters  and to agents the company set out to seize cameras  By 1912  most major film companies had set up production facilities in Southern California near or in Los Angeles because of the location s proximity to Mexico  as well as the region s favorable year round weather  3   edit  Rise of Hollywood Cinema ofthe United States 1890s 1890 1891 1892 1893 18941895 1896 1897

Pickford  Lionel Barrymore  and others  They started filming on a vacant lot near Georgia Street in downtown Los Angeles  While there  the company decided to explore new territories  traveling several miles north to Hollywood  a little village that was friendly and enjoyed the movie company filming there  Griffith then filmed the first movie ever shot in Hollywood  In Old California  a Biograph melodrama about California in the 19th century  when it belonged to Mexico  Biograph stayed there for months and made several films before returning to New York  After hearing about Biograph s success in Hollywood  in 1913 many movie makers headed west to avoid the fees imposed by Thomas Edison  who owned patents on the movie making process  4  In Los Angeles  California  the studios and Hollywood grew  Before World War I  movies were made in several U S  cities  but filmmakers gravitated to southern California as the industry developed  They were attracted by the mild climate and reliable sunlight  which made it possible to film movies outdoors year round  and by the varied scenery that was available  There are several starting points for cinema  particularly American cinema   but it was Griffith s controversial 1915 epic Birth of a Nation that pioneered the worldwide filming vocabulary that still dominates celluloid to this day  In the early 20th century  when the medium was new  many Jewish immigrants found employment in the U S  film industry  They were able to make their mark in a brand new business  the exhibition of short films in storefront theaters called nickelodeons  after their admission price of a nickel  five cents   Within a few years  ambitious men like Samuel Goldwyn  William Fox  Carl Laemmle  Adolph Zukor  Louis B  Mayer  and the Warner Brothers  Harry  Albert  Samuel  and Jack  had switched to the production side of the business  Soon they were the heads of a new kind of enterprise  the movie studio   It is worth noting that the US had at least one female director  producer and studio head in these early years  Alice Guy Blach    They also set the stage for the industry s internationalism  the industry is often accused of Amero centric provincialism  Other moviemakers arrived from Europe after World War I  directors like Ernst Lubitsch  Alfred Hitchcock  Fritz Lang  and Jean Renoir  and actors like Rudolph Valentino  Marlene Dietrich  Ronald Colman  and Charles Boyer  They joined a homegrown supply of actors   lured west from the New York City stage after the introduction of sound films   to form one of the 20th century s most remarkable growth industries  At motion pictures  height of popularity in the mid 1940s  the studios were cranking out a total of about 400 movies a year  seen by an audience of 90 million Americans per week  1   Sound also became widely used in Hollywood in the late 1920s  2   After The Jazz Singer  the first film with synchronized voices  was successfully released as a Vitaphone talkie in 1927  Hollywood film companies would respond to Warner Bros  and begin to use Vitaphone sound   which Warner Bros  owned until 1928   in future films  By May 1928  Electrical Research Product Incorporated  ERPI   a subsidiary of the Western Electric company  gained a monopoly over film sound distribution  3   A side effect of the  talkies  was that many actors who had made their careers in silent films suddenly found themselves out of work  as they often had bad voices or could not remember their lines  Meanwhile  in 1922  US politician Will H  Hays left politics and formed the movie studio boss organization known as the Motion Pictures Distributors Association of America  MPDAA   4   The organization became the Motion Picture Association of America after Hays retired in 1945  In the early times of talkies  American studios found that their sound productions were rejected in foreign language markets and even among speakers of other dialects of English  The synchronization technology was still too primitive for dubbing  One of the solutions was creating parallel foreign language versions of Hollywood films  Around 1930  the American companies opened a studio in Joinville le Pont  France  where the same sets and wardrobe and even mass scenes were used for different time sharing crews  Also  foreign unemployed actors  playwrights and winners of photogenia contests were chosen and brought to Hollywood  where they shot parallel versions of the English language films  These parallel versions had a lower budget  were shot at night and were directed by second line American directors who did not speak the foreign language  The Spanish language crews included people like Luis Bu uel  Enrique Jardiel Poncela  Xavier Cugat and Edgar Neville  The productions were not very successful in their intended markets  due to the following reasons  The lower budgets were apparent  Many theater actors had no previous experience in cinema  The original movies were often second rate themselves  since studios expected that the top productions would sell by themselves  The mix of foreign accents  Castilian  Mexican  and Chilean for example in the Spanish case  was odd for the audiences  Some markets lacked sound equipped theaters  In spite of this  some productions like the Spanish version of Dracula compare favorably with the original  By the mid 1930s  synchronization had advanced enough for dubbing to become usual   edit  Golden Age of Hollywood Golden Age of Hollywood  1st row  l r  Greta Garbo  Humphrey Bogart  Lauren Bacall  Clark

During the so called Golden Age of Hollywood  which lasted from the end of the silent era in American cinema in the late 1920s to the early 1960s  thousands of movies were issued from the Hollywood studios  The start of the Golden Age was arguably when The Jazz Singer was released in 1927  ending the silent era and increasing box office profits for films as sound was introduced to feature films  Most Hollywood pictures adhered closely to a formula   Western  slapstick comedy  musical  animated cartoon  biopic  biographical picture    and the same creative teams often worked on films made by the same studio  For example  Cedric Gibbons and Herbert Stothart always worked on MGM films  Alfred Newman worked at 20th Century Fox for twenty years  Cecil B  De Mille s films were almost all made at Paramount  and director Henry King s films were mostly made for 20th Century Fox  At the same time  one could usually guess which studio made which film  largely because of the actors who appeared in it  MGM  for example  claimed it had contracted  more stars than there are in heaven   Each studio had its own style and characteristic touches which made it possible to know this   a trait that does not exist today  For example  To Have and Have Not  1944  is famous not only for the first pairing of actors Humphrey Bogart  1899 1957  and Lauren Bacall  1924   but also for being written by two future winners of the Nobel Prize in Literature  Ernest Hemingway  1899 1961   the author of the novel on which the script was nominally based  and William Faulkner  1897 1962   who worked on the screen adaptation  After The Jazz Singer was released in 1927  Warner Bros  gained huge success and were able to acquire their own string of movie theaters  after purchasing Stanley Theaters and First National Productions in 1928  MGM had also owned the Loews string of theaters since forming in 1924  and the Fox Film Corporation owned the Fox Theatre strings as well  Also  RKO  a 1928 merger between Keith Orpheum Theaters and the Radio Corporation of America 5   responded to the Western Electric ERPI monopoly over sound in films  and developed their own method  known as Photophone  to put sound in films  5   Paramount  which already acquired Balaban and Katz in 1926  would answer to the success of Warner Bros  and RKO  and buy a number of theaters in the late 1920s as well  and would hold a monopoly on theaters in Detroit  Michigan  6  By the 1930s  all of America s theaters were owned by the Big Five studios   MGM  Paramount Pictures  RKO  Warner Bros   and 20th Century Fox   6   Movie making was still a business however  and motion picture companies made money by operating under the studio system  The major studios kept thousands of people on salary   actors  producers  directors  writers  stunt men  craftspersons  and technicians  They owned or leased Movie Ranches in rural Southern California for location shooting of westerns and other large scale genre films  And they owned hundreds of theaters in cities and towns across the nation  theaters that showed their films and that were always in need of fresh material  In 1930  MPDAA President Will Hays created the Hays  Production  Code  which followed censorship guidelines and went into effect after government threats of censorship expanded by 1930  7   However  the code was never enforced until 1934  after the Catholic watchdog organization The Legion of Decency   appalled by some of the provocative films and lurid advertising of the era later classified Pre Code Hollywood  threatened a boycott of motion pictures if it didn t go into effect  8   Those films that didn t obtain a seal of approval from the Production Code Administration had to pay a  25 000 00 fine and could not profit in the theaters  as the MPDAA owned every theater in the country through the Big Five studios  9   Throughout the 1930s  as well as most of the golden age  MGM dominated the film screen and had the top stars in Hollywood  and was also credited for creating the Hollywood star system altogether  10   Some MGM stars included  King of Hollywood  Clark Gable  Lionel Barrymore  Jean Harlow  Norma Shearer  Greta Garbo  Joan Crawford  Jeanette MacDonald and husband Gene Raymond  Spencer Tracy  Judy Garland  and Gene Kelly  11   But MGM did not stand alone  Another great achievement of US cinema during this era came through Walt Disney s animation company  In 1937  Disney created the most successful film of its time  Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs  12   This distinction was promptly topped in 1939 when Selznick International created what is still  when adjusted for inflation  the most successful film of all time  Gone with the Wind  13   Many film historians have remarked upon the many great works of cinema that emerged from this period of highly regimented film making  One reason this was possible is that  with so many movies being made  not every one had to be a big hit  A studio could gamble on a medium budget feature with a good script and relatively unknown actors  Citizen Kane  directed by Orson Welles  1915 1985  and often regarded as the greatest film of all time  fits that description  In other cases  strong willed directors like Howard Hawks  1896 1977   Alfred Hitchcock  1899 1980  and Frank Capra  1897 1991  battled the studios in order to achieve their artistic visions  The apogee of the studio system may have been the year 1939  which saw the release of such classics as The Wizard of Oz  Gone with the Wind  Stagecoach  Mr  Smith Goes to Washington  Wuthering Heights  Only Angels Have Wings  Ninotchka  and Midnight  Among the other films from the Golden Age period that are now considered to be classics  Casablanca  It s a Wonderful Life  It Happened One Night  the original King Kong  Mutiny on the Bounty  Top Hat  City Lights  Red River  The Lady from Shanghai  Rear Window  Some Like It Hot and The Manchurian Candidate   edit  Decline of the studio system The studio system and the Golden Age of Hollywood succumbed to two forces that developed in the late 1940s  a federal antitrust action that separated the production of films from their exhibition  and the advent of television  In 1938  Walt Disney s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was released during a run of lackluster films from the major studios  and quickly became the highest grossing film released to that point  Embarrassingly for the studios  it was an independently produced animated film that did not feature any studio employed stars  7  This stoked already widespread frustration at the practice of block booking  in which studios would only sell an entire year s schedule of films at a time to theaters and use the lock in to cover for releases of mediocre quality  Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold a noted  trust buster  of the Roosevelt administration   took this opportunity to initiate proceedings against the eight largest Hollywood studios in July 1938 for violations of the Sherman Anti Trust Act  8  9  The federal suit resulted in five of the eight studios  the  Big Five   Warner Bros   MGM  Fox  RKO and Paramount  reaching a compromise with Arnold in October 1940 and signing a consent decree agreeing to  within three years  Eliminate the block booking of short film subjects  in an arrangement known as  one shot   or  full force  block booking  Eliminate the block booking of any more than five features in their theaters  No longer engage in blind buying  or the buying of films by theater districts without seeing films beforehand  and instead have trade showing  in which all 31 theater districts in US would see films every two weeks before showing movies in theaters  Set up an administration board in each theater district to enforce these requirements  8  The  Little Three   Universal Studios  United Artists  and Columbia Pictures   who did not own any theaters  refused to participate in the consent decree  8  9  A number of independent film producers were also unhappy with the compromise and formed a union known as the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers and sued Paramount for the monopoly they still had over the Detroit Theaters   as Paramount was also gaining dominance through actors like Bob Hope  Paulette Goddard  Veronica Lake  Betty Hutton  crooner Bing Crosby  Alan Ladd  and longtime actor for studio Gary Cooper too  by 1942  The Big Five studios didn t meet the requirements of the Consent of Decree during WWII  without major consequence  but after the war ended they joined Paramount as defendants in the Hollywood anti trust case  as did the Little Three studios  14   The Supreme Court eventually ruled that the major studios ownership of theaters and film distribution was a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act  As a result  the studios began to release actors and technical staff from their contracts with the studios  This changed the paradigm of film making by the major Hollywood studios  as each could have an entirely different cast and creative team  The decision resulted in the gradual loss of the characteristics which made MGM  Paramount  Universal  Columbia  RKO  and Fox films immediately identifiable  Certain movie people  such as Cecil B  DeMille  either remained contract artists till the end of their careers or used the same creative teams on their films  so that a DeMille film still looked like one whether it was made in 1932 or 1956  Also  the number of movies being produced annually dropped as the average budget soared  marking a major change in strategy for the industry  Studios now aimed to produce entertainment that could not be offered by television  spectacular  larger than life productions  Studios also began to sell portions of their theatrical film libraries to other companies to sell to television  By 1949  all major film studios had given up ownership of their theaters  Television was also instrumental in the decline of Hollywood s Golden Age as it broke the movie industry s hegemony in American entertainment  Despite this  the film industry was also able to gain some leverage for future films as longtime government censorship faded in the 1950s  After the Paramount anti trust case ended  Hollywood movie studios no longer owned theaters  and thus made it so foreign films could be released in American theaters without censorship  This was complemented with the 1952 Miracle Decision in the Joseph Burstyn Inc  v Wilson case  in which the Supreme Court of the United States reversed its earlier position  from 1915 s Mutual Film Corporation v  Industrial Commission of Ohio case  and stated that motion pictures were a form of art and were entitled to the protection of the First amendment  US laws could no longer censor films  By 1968  with film studios becoming increasingly defiant to its censorship function  the Motion Picture Association of America  MPAA  had replaced the Hays Code which was now greatly violated after the government threat of censorship that justified the origin of the code had ended with the film rating system   edit  New Hollywood and post classical cinema Post classical cinema is a term used to describe the changing methods of storytelling in the New Hollywood  It has been argued that new approaches to drama and characterization played upon audience expectations acquired in the classical period  chronology may be scrambled  storylines may feature  twist endings   and lines between the antagonist and protagonist may be blurred  The roots of post classical storytelling may be seen in film noir  in Rebel Without a Cause  1955   and in Hitchcock s storyline shattering Psycho   New Hollywood  is a term used to describe the emergence of a new generation of film school trained directors who had absorbed the techniques developed in Europe in the 1960s  The 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde marked the beginning of American cinema rebounding as well  as a new generation of films would afterwards gain success at the box offices as well  15   Filmmakers like Francis Ford Coppola  George Lucas  Martin Scorsese  Roman Polanski  and William Friedkin came to produce fare that paid homage to the history of film  and developed upon existing genres and techniques  In the early 1970s  their films were often both critically acclaimed and commercially successful  While the early New Hollywood films like Bonnie and Clyde and Easy Rider had been relatively low budget affairs with amoral heroes and increased sexuality and violence  the enormous success enjoyed by Friedkin with The Exorcist  Spielberg with Jaws  Coppola with The Godfather and Apocalypse Now  Scorsese with Taxi Driver and Lucas with American Graffiti  and Star Wars  respectively helped to give rise to the modern  blockbuster   and induced studios to focus ever more heavily on trying to produce enormous hits  10  The increasing indulgence of these young directors did not help  citation needed  Often  when   they d go overschedule  and overbudget  thus bankrupting themselves or the studio  citation needed  The three most famous examples of this are Francis Coppola s Apocalypse Now and One From The Heart and particularly Michael Cimino s Heaven s Gate  which single handedly bankrupted United Artists  However  Coppola s Apocalypse Now eventually made its money back and gained widespread recognition as a masterpiece  11   edit  Rise of the home video market The 1980s and 1990s saw another significant development  The full acceptance of home video by studios opened a vast new business to exploit  Films such as Showgirls  The Secret of NIMH and The Shawshank Redemption  which performed poorly in their theatrical run  were now able to find success in the video market  It also saw the first generation of film makers with access to video tapes emerge  Directors such as Quentin Tarantino and P T  Anderson had been able to view thousands of films and produced films with vast numbers of references and connections to previous works  This  along with the explosion of independent film and ever decreasing costs for filmmaking  changed the landscape of American movie making once again  and led a renaissance of filmmaking among Hollywood s lower and middle classes those without access to studio financial resources  With the rise of the DVD in the 21st century  DVDs have quickly become even more profitable to studios and have led to an explosion of packaging extra scenes  extended versions  and commentary tracks with the films   edit  Modern cinema Some of Hollywood s blockbuster action heroes from the 1980s and 1990s  From left   top row  Sylvester Stallone  Arnold Schwarzenegger  Bruce Willis  Steven Segal  bottom row  Dolph Lundgren  Jean Claude Van Damme  Wesley Snipes  Jackie Chan  The drive to produce a spectacle on the movie screen has largely shaped American cinema ever since  Spectacular epics which took advantage of new widescreen processes had been increasingly popular from the 1950s onwards  Since then  American films have become increasingly divided into two categories  Blockbusters and independent films  Studios have focused on relying on a handful of extremely expensive releases every year in order to remain profitable  Such blockbusters emphasize spectacle  star power  and high production value  all of which entail an enormous budget  Blockbusters typically rely upon star power and massive advertising to attract a huge audience  A successful blockbuster will attract an audience large enough to offset production costs and reap considerable profits  Such productions carry a substantial risk of failure  and most studios release blockbusters that both over  and underperform in a year  Classic blockbusters from this period include E T   Back to the Future  Beverly Hills Cop  Top Gun  Wall Street  Rain Man  Pulp Fiction  Titanic  The Matrix  The Green Mile  The Sixth Sense  Star Wars Episode I  The Phantom Menace  Gangs of New York and The Bourne Identity  12  Film industry  1995 2010  13 All values in billions Year Tickets Revenue 1995 1 22  5 29 1996 1 26  5 59 1997 1 42  6 51 1998 1 44

10 89 Studios supplement these movies with independent productions  made with small budgets and often independently of the studio corporation  Movies made in this manner typically emphasize high professional quality in terms of acting  directing  screenwriting  and other elements associated with production  and also upon creativity and innovation  These movies usually rely upon critical praise or niche marketing to garner an audience  Because of an independent film s low budgets  a successful independent film can have a high profit to cost ratio  while a failure will incur minimal losses  allowing for studios to sponsor dozens of such productions in addition to their high stakes releases  American independent cinema was revitalized in the late 1980s and early 1990s when another new generation of moviemakers  including Spike Lee  Steven Soderbergh  Kevin Smith  and Quentin Tarantino made movies like  respectively  Do the Right Thing  Sex  Lies  and Videotape  Clerks  and Reservoir Dogs  In terms of directing  screenwriting  editing  and other elements  these movies were innovative and often irreverent  playing with and contradicting the conventions of Hollywood movies  Furthermore  their considerable financial successes and crossover into popular culture reestablished the commercial viability of independent film  Since then  the independent film industry has become more clearly defined and more influential in American cinema  Many of the major studios have capitalised on this by developing subsidiaries to produce similar films  for example Fox Searchlight Pictures  To a lesser degree in the early 21st century  film types that were previously considered to have only a minor presence in the mainstream movie market began to arise as more potent American box office draws  These include foreign language films such as Crouching Tiger  Hidden Dragon and Hero and documentary films such as Super Size Me  March of the Penguins  and Michael Moore s Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 9 11   edit  Hollywood and politics In the 1930s the Democrats and the Republicans saw money in Hollywood  President Franklin Roosevelt saw a huge partnership with Hollywood  He used the first real potential of Hollywood s stars in a national campaign  Melvyn Douglas toured Washington in 1939 and met the key New Dealers  Endorsements letters from leading actors were signed  radio appearances and printed advertising were made  Movie stars were used to draw a large audience into the political view of the party  By the 1960s  John F  Kennedy was a new  young face for Washington  and his strong friendship with Frank Sinatra exemplified this new era of glamor  The last moguls of Hollywood were gone and younger  newer executives and producers began generating more liberal ideas  Celebrities and money attracted politicians into the high class  glittering Hollywood life style  As Ronald Brownstein wrote in his book  The Power and the Glitter   television in the 1970s and 1980s was an enormously important new media in politics and Hollywood helped in that media with actors making speeches on their political beliefs  like Jane Fonda against the Vietnam War  14  This era saw former actor Ronald Reagan became Governor of California and subsequently become President of the United States  It continued with Arnold Schwarzenegger as California s Governor in 2003  Today Washington s interest is in Hollywood donations  On February 20  2007  for example  Barack Obama had a  2300 a plate Hollywood gala  being hosted by David Geffen  Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg at the Beverly Hilton  15  Hollywood is a huge donator for presidential campaigns and this money attracts politicians  Not only is Hollywood influencing Washington with its glamour and money but Washington also influences Hollywood  16   edit  The American Takeover of World Markets In 1912  American film companies were largely immersed in the competition for the domestic market  It was difficult to satisfy the huge demand for films created by the nickelodeon boom  Motion Picture Patents Company members such as Edison  also sought to limit competition from French  Italian and other imported films  However  it was obvious that a great deal of money was to be made in exporting films  A company named Vitagraph was the first American company to open its own distribution offices in Europe  Vitagraph had established a branch in London in 1906  and a second branch in Paris shortly after  Other American companies were moving into foreign markets as well  American distribution abroad continued to expand until the mid 1920s  Originally  a majority of companies sold their films indirectly  However  since they were inexperienced in overseas trading  they simply sold the foreign rights to their films to foreign distribution firms or export agents  Gradually  London became a center for the international circulation of U S  films  Many British companies made a profit by acting as the agents for this business  By doing this  they weakened British production by turning over a large share of the U K  market to American films  By 1911  approximately 60
