European comics Hungarian comics are comics made in Hungary and by the Hungarian diaspora of the surrounding countries  When dealing with Hungarian comics  one cannot separate comics made by Hungarians from translated foreign matter  since in some eras most of the publications come from the latter group and influence comics fandom and the general picture about comics in the country  The roots of Hungarian comics reach back to the mid 19th century  Until the late 1930s the development of the genre were parallel to current European trends  Comic strips were generally found in newspapers and magazines  featuring works from both Hungarian and foreign artists  Since comics were so closely bound to the printed media  their creators were mostly caricature artists as well  The years preceding World War II proved to be unfavorable for comics as the mainly Jewish owned yellow press basically disappeared together with comic strips  a great exception were children s comics   After the few years of the transitional phase following World War II  Hungarian cultural politics were influenced by the Soviet Union  as a consequence comics were regarded as  western cultural trash  and were basically forbidden for years  By the mid 1950s comics were tolerated  but with strict compromises  Under these years adaptational comics were made in great numbers  This period lasting until the late 1970s is regarded by some comics historians as the Golden Age of Hungarian comics  the most respected artists  Ern  Z r d  Imre Seb k and P l Korcsm ros lived and were active during this period lasting until the mid 1970s  In the 1980s  under a warmer political climate  translations of foreign comics were published in growing numbers  After the fall of the iron curtain a large variety of translated European and American comics were published in the country  Although most companies were full of enthusiasm  only few were strong enough in capital to live through the radically altering circumstances of the 1990s  This course eventually resulted in the American  superhero  comics dominance by the middle of the decade  These years also witnessed the appearance of a new generation of Hungarian comics creators  The few years preceding and following the new millennium seemed to be least successful for comics  many magazines folded during these years leaving several fans without comics  This and some other factors caused fans  artists  publishers  merchants to connect on the Internet and set up new foundations for a wholly revised comics scene  The period lasting since 2004 2005 is commonly referred to as the new wave of Hungarian comics  since comics scene participants show a degree of activity never seen before  Contents 1 Vocabulary 2 History 2 1 From the 19th century

has made on comics   edit  From the 19th century until World War I A J nos Jank  sequentially illustrated story in a Hungarian news journal  1867  During the late 19th century Hungary  as part of the Austro Hungarian Empire  kept pace with the European trends  pointing in the direction of what later became to be known as modern comics  Rodolphe T pffer and especially Wilhelm Busch  Max und Moritz  were popular and had great effect on Hungarian journalism  6  and soon the Hungarian equivalents were born  One of the most important writers of the time  M r J kai founded  1858 August 21  and edited a magazine called  st k s  comet  based on Fliegende Bl tter   During the Monarchy German language Fliegende Bl tter was a popular magazine in Hungary  with several thousand subscribers in the country  7    Pages were filled with caricatures and  pictorial stories   called k pt rt netek  k pes t rt netek   the European predecessor of modern comics  A short story was told in few sequential pictures  and the text  many times in rhyming poetic form  was placed beneath the images  8  Many similar journals existed besides  st k s  Hungary had a flourishing caricature culture at the time  and many of the greatest artists also drew these early types of comics  9   edit  Notable artists This list contains those comics artists  who are emphasized in Hungarian comics history writings  10  J nos Jank

as many Hungarian comics were made in this period  while   for example   Yugoslavia  the southern neighbor  claims this period to be their Golden Age  28  During this period the truncated Hungary was an ally of Germany  In 1937 the Minister of Justice began restricting the great amount of pulp literature and yellow press  In 1938 a decree ordered the whole press under the control of the Government  In the same year the  First Jewish Law  was issued  29  Among others the goal of these two were to  clean  Hungary s cultural life  to eliminate pulp literature  As the  js g  a Hungarian extremist newspaper  commented in 1938   These are not at all capable to nurture Hungarian self knowledge  Hungarian honesty  Hungarian heroism  consequentially to nurture the Hungarian folk  national and racial self knowledge   30  Since most of the comics were published in the mostly Jewish owned yellow press  comics vanished after the law took effect  31  The situation became even worse after the German troops marched into Hungary  all leftist and liberal media was banned  32  The only comics of the time were antisemitic ones  from magazines as the militant Harc  combat  or anticommunist ones from newspapers as Egyed l vagyunk  we are alone   31  33   edit  Notable artists This list contains those comics artists  who are emphasized in Hungarian comics history writings  10  K roly M hlbeck

peasant youth magazine  with collectivist propaganda comics  A typical example from the late 1940s  In the post war period  Hungary s cultural politics were heavily influenced by the Soviet Union  In the first few years comics returned to the newspapers and other magazines  first humorous children comics in 1945  38  then communist propaganda strips in 1948  The Hungarian term for comics   k preg ny   became widespread during this short period  38  In 1950   according to a famous anecdote   during a visit to Budapest  Finogenov  an influential aesthete from Moscow  called comic books an  imperialist vestige   Within a few days Hungarian prime minister  M ty s R kosi withdrew all the  western cultural trash  from the press  31  Furthermore Dr  Fredric Wertham s Seduction of the Innocent attracted some attention on the eastern side of the Iron Curtain  His anti comics accusations echoed in Hungarian newspaper articles  Some of these were written by Hungarian journalists  but some were translations of American articles  at least signed by American names   31  39  During these years even caricatures ridiculed comics for its aggressive nature and pairing it with western trash  40  In 1954 Ern  Z r d  one of Hungary s all time greatest comic book artists  dared to bring back comics with his adaptation of Vladimir Obruchev s Plutonia  comics  title  Az  szaki sarkr l a F ld belsej be   From the North Pole to the Center of the Earth   38  This was published in Pajt s  a magazine for the Pioneer movement  the communist co ed equivalent for scouting   1955 was a milestone in Hungarian comic book history  since this was the year when graphic illustrator S ndor Gugi convinced Tibor Horv th  Later Tibor Cs  Horv th  to create some comics together  It was also Gugi s idea to produce comics that adapt classic literature  38  No one could call adaptations of famous and recognized literary works  decadent western trash   so comics received a green light at the time  Gugi presumably got the idea of adaptational comics from Classics Illustrated  41  Adaptational comics  what started out as a trick  became dominant for decades  S ndor Gugi left the field relatively early  but Tibor Cs  Horv th produced a vast of comics scripts for some very talented artists such as Imre Seb k  P l Korcsm ros and Ern  Z r d  These three had their own easily recognizable style and are considered the greatest comic artists of Hungary  38  42  At the time comics were not published in separate comic books  but sequentially in newspapers  e g  N pszava   magazines  e g  K pes  js g  Pajt s   and the crossword puzzle magazine F les  F les later became a flagship of Hungarian comic publishing   F les published the most comics during the period  It was the most important publisher of P l Korcsm ros and important publisher for artists like Ern  Z r d   43  In December 1956  a few weeks after the soviet tanks ended the Revolution of 1956  Gy rgy G l and some journalists started conceiving a new  entertaining weekly magazine based on previous magazines such as Pesti Iz  and F les Bagoly  The magazine based on crossword puzzles  articles and comics immediately became a large success  44  Some say the magazine had a role in healing the wounds  44  Between January 1957 and December 1960 11 artists drew especially comics  The sum of their work during this period was 145 comics in 2000 pages  50  of the storyboards were written by Tibor Cs  Horv th  the other by 17 other writers  40  of the art was done by P l Korcsm ros  in 1957 he drew 238 pages only for F les   20  by Ern  Z r d and 14  by Imre Seb k  45  Some attempts were made to create pure comic magazines  One of these was T bort z  1957 1965   another magazine for Pioneers  based on the French Camera 34 and full of fresh ideas  Although it did not meet the Pioneer Association s ideas and ordered the editorial to drastically reduce the number of comic pages in the magazine  46  A page illustrating adaptational comics with too much textual information  Rejt  Cs Horv th Korcsm ros  A l thatatlan ember  Adaptational comics are still the source of controversies and debates  Although in most cases the art was beautiful  the panels were heavily packed with narrative texts   a trademark of Tibor Cs  Horv th  47  By the early sixties this comics type fell into a trap from which it could not escape until recent times  On one hand intellectuals criticized these works for the lack of originality  novelty and artistry  48  while another major accusation was that comics in general restrict reading habits  49  However  adaptational comics provided a safe relationship with the cultural political leadership  and were still popular  comic book import was close to zero  so nothing forced comic artists to move on further  Still  this compromise made the production of comics possible  In many other countries of the Ex Eastern Bloc  e g  Czechoslovakia  Soviet Union  Romania  the situation was even worse with almost no comics of their own  However  it should be noted that some other Eastern Bloc countries at that time had substantial comic book culture  like Yugoslavia and Poland   Yugoslavia was not influenced directly by the Soviet Union   For further readings on Ex Eastern bloc comics culture  Serbian comics  Polish comics  Czech comics A splash page from the 1983 version of Plutonia  Utaz s Plut ni ba   Art by Ern  Z r d A page from the adaptation of Jack London s The Mexican  Art by Imre Seb k  1959 Ern  Z r d ended his professional relationship with Tibor Cs  Horv th and wrote his own comic scripts  50  Luckily Z r d was not just a great artist  but also a talented storyteller  these comics came much closer to the medium s own language  50  He also made experimental collage comics in the early seventies attracting international attention  These works were invited to the Salone Internazionale del Comics festival in 1970 but his portfolio   due to Hungarian bureaucracy   has arrived late  Furthermore the works has been stolen from the festival  38  51  By the late seventies the classic trio of Hungarian comics creators disappeared  Korcsm ros died in 1975  Seb k died in 1980 and Z r d retired temporarily  Since young talents were not introduced during the preceding three decades  except for Attila Fazekas   many mark these years the end of Hungarian comics  golden age  38  In the early 1970s famous cartoonists  Attila Dargay  Marcell Jankovics  made ventures in the comics medium  Both of them were talented comic book creators  but both of them rather considered animation as their main field  Jankovics even went as far as publicly despising comics  38  52 Dargay continued to create comics in the 1980s  At the time very few foreign comics were allowed to be published for the Hungarian market  53  The exceptions were mainly comics from the Eastern bloc or comics with socialist communist background  The exceptions  Mozaik  The East German Mosaik was first published in 1971 and ran as a monthly comic book series from 1973 until 1990  Outside East Germany Mosaik was the most popular in Hungary  and still has many hardcore fans  The issues were edited in Hungary  published and printed in GDR together with the original German version  than distributed by the Hungarian Postal Service  54  The title returned to the newsstands in 2001 and is still published alongside many special issues for collectors  Pif and Vaillant  These were imported from France and sold at newspaper stands  This was allowed because the biweekly magazine belonged to the communist L Humanit  newspaper group  55  In the seventies some French  mainly from Vaillant  and Italian  mainly western from Bonelli  comics were published in F les  Pajt s  etc  43  Danish and Finnish editions of American superhero comics were printed in Hungary s Kossuth nyomda  A large number of these forbidden fruits were sold traded on flea markets  despite the fact most Hungarians could not read them  56  In an environment much more liberal  the Hungarian minorities of Yugoslavia published many comics  The most important publisher of the time was Forum Marketprint  which presented Buksi magazine in the sixties  This was the Hungarian language print of the Serbo Croatian Kekec magazine  also published by Forum Marketprint  57   edit  Notable artists

Horv th Tibor  script  to work together on adaptational comics  a specific comics genre that would dominate Hungarian comics production for decades  Between 1954 and 1960 he laid down the basis of comics writing and drawing in the country  than suddenly left the field only to return with two Rejt  adaptations in 1970  Gugi could create in many different styles at an equally high quality  He is also known for spending much time researching clothes  architecture  furniture and other details before starting drawing a comic  59  60  In 2006 a collection of his works were reprinted in the comic

N B  at the time the main field of Hungarian comics were still newspapers  magazines   The Ministry of Culture  the Office of Information and the General Directory of Publishing previously never authorized such attempts  67  The less harsh tone of the mid  and late eighties  see Glasnost  brought some changes in the field of comics  Some foreign comics were allowed to be published in Hungarian  not just comics from the Eastern Bloc  e g  Mozaik  or comics from communist French publisher L Humanit   Vaillant  Pif Gadget   but some politically  harmless  series as Asterix and Lucky

74  75  Most importantly this was the period when Hungarian comics spread from newspapers and magazines to individual comic books  albums  76  Generally these comics were published in two distinct formats  Small  cca  15 x 21 5 cm   cheap  black and white comic books  These were usually reissues of stories that ran in 4 page installments in F les  Even the size was the same  Later Attila Fazekas made comics that were published originally in this format  Most notable of these reissues was the Rejt  sorozat sequel  that collected then already classic adaptations of Jen  Rejt  s novels  Despite the fact that these were drastically re edited by Tibor Cs  Horv th they were very popular  bringing these stories close to another young generation  Among these comic books  most loved were P

they were also reissues  but redesigned  colored by the artist himself  They were published in two unanimous series  76  Other important  but short comics were published in the sci fi anthology

1989 2003  A comic strip by H rom Mad r M hely  Three Birds Workshop  published in the absurd humor magazine  Kret n  1995  With no substantial orders  the three artists disappeared by the end of the millennium  First page from Imre Fekete s absurd fantasy comic  Nyak k  s az  r  Medallion and the Guard   The art shows Fekete s early style he gave up for a less detailed and more cartoon like style  The early nineties were a very chaotic  but exciting and optimistic era in terms of comics  Because no one was told what is and is not to be published  many saw great opportunities in releasing comics  In these years a large variety of comics came into the country  not as direct import  but in the form of translations   all kinds of European  American comics  86  Although most companies were full of enthusiasm  but only few were strong in capital  87  88  In the meantime  the whole newspaper and magazine distribution system went through major changes  leaving magazines in a worse situation  89  Magazine print numbers dropped by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude  Therefore most of them disappeared after a few months or years  90  By 1992 such great series as Men  Man   Italian comics for teenage readers   Krampusz  Italian comics for adult readers   Hepiend Magazin  Conan  Punisher   Vampi  European and American horror  fantasy  erotic comics  vanished  Besides the inexperience of the small publishing companies  the comics reading audience might not have been ready for these type of comics  In many cases their true value was only discovered in recent years  91  This was not the case for superhero comics  In the last months of the People s Republic of Hungary American superhero comics finally were allowed to be published  92  The first superhero story was published in 1989  in a special issue of Alfa magazine  This was the Revenge of the Living Monolith  A monolit bossz ja   a Marvel team up story  Also in 1989  after a few years of publishing foreign children s comics  Bobo  G li t  Pink Panther  Tumak  Pejk   etc   Interprint plunged into superhero comics  First The Phantom  than Spider Man   In 1991 Interprint joined the Swedish Semic group  which resulted in Semic Interprint   The company started releasing Batman in January 1990 and Superman later in the same year  DC comics were not as popular as Marvel superheroes  so the titles merged and were made bimonthly in 1992 as Superman  s Batman  93 X Men started in June 1992 and Marvel Extra  a compilation of all sorts of Marvel superhero stories  in February 1993  Hungarian comic book artists found themselves in a very new and alien situation  while comics were having their heyday  young readers  interest drifted from Hungarian comics to the much more modern and spectacular superhero comics  Attila Fazekas  whose Star Wars adaptations were printed in 300 000 copies a decade earlier  94  now tries every way to remain on the surface  He produced and published his own magazine  Botond  These comic books comprised all kinds of stories  from historical to action  Every issue had a story of Botond  a character based on Hungarian legends and Asterix  He also experimented with erotic  or rather pornographic  comics   with surprisingly small success  95  With no major outlet  Hungarian comics started to fade  To this day many directly accuse Semic Interprint and its monthly  dump  of superhero comics for this phenomenon  96  As the country s leading comic book publisher  Semic Interprint never published a Hungarian comic book in these fragile years  cf  after WWII France   and many other West European countries   had an anti American self protective law  a foundation of their flourishing comics culture   Others protect it on the basis of free market  97  In March 1994 Semic Interprint launched the bimonthly Kret n  cretin   This absurd and satirical humor magazine is somewhat like Mad or Fluide Glacial  In this magazine many talented artists introduced themselves to a larger audience  Zsolt H  Garisa  Zolt n  Zerge  Varga  Imre  Feki  Fekete  Csete  Gergely G nd cs  etc    It can be considered the most important and prestigious outlet for Hungarian comics at the time  98  F les and new crossword puzzle magazines are still popular in Hungary  but comics readers  attention has drifted away from these  leaving the collecting of the comics published in these to hardcore  and mostly veteran fans  96  In 1996 Marvel went bankrupt and drastically raised the royalties collected upon translations  99  therefore Hungarian Marvel titles were canceled in December 1996  Marvel Extra  and January 1997  X Men  Transformer   However the most popular title  Csod latos P kember  Amazing Spider Man   managed to survive  In the same year Semic Interprint started publishing Spawn as a bimonthly with two stories in each issue  In 1999  after its tenth year  120th issue the company doubled the magazine s number of pages  from 32 to 76  and price too  Every issue contained three complete Spider Man stories  The Amazing Spider Man  Peter Parker Spider Man  Webspinners Tales of Spider Man   all starting out from  1   The stories did not fulfill the Hungarian needs and the price seemed to be too high  resulting in the canceling of the title at the end of the year  along with Spawn  100  101  102  The price of the bimonthly  not so popular Superman  s Batman managed to continue until December 2001  as the only superhero title published in Hungarian  103  In 2001 Csod latos P kember was relaunched  but instead of carrying on with the Spider Man continuity  it served a younger audience with the translations of Ultimate Spider Man  Leaving Kret n and the bimonthly Star Wars out of account  Semic Interprint shifted to the children s audience with other flagship titles such as Dragon Ball  cancelled soon after   Garfield  and D rm g  D m t r  Children s comics were the main profile of major publishers like Egmont  Tom  s Jerry  Donald Kacsa magazin  and smaller companies such as Abrafaxe Kft   Mozaik   later continued by N Press  than Ratius   104   edit  Recent revival  2004   After the comic book boom of the 1990s comics fans witnessed a fast downfall around the turn of the Millennium  2003 can be regarded as the low point in the scene  when 117 individual comic publications were issued throughout the whole year  The vast majority of these comics were children s comics sold at newspaper stands  By 2003 a generation reached their adolescence with no substantial comic book intake  and the generation that once grew up on superhero comics was left with hardly any comics since the late nineties and more importantly  reached their young adulthood  Looking back  the total lack of a comic book scene in the early 2000s proved to have a cleansing effect and pushed many to rebuild the whole scene from its base  The first to act were remaining hardcore fans  who began to organize into web communities on Internet forums and a new scene developed on the basis of scanlations  Since no comic books were sold on the market  fans began to scan  translate  re letter and share digital comics  In English speaking countries scanlations usually refer to manga  105  but in Hungary the process of fan translations and lettering started with Marvel superhero type comics  and then moved on to other types  106  The most notable achievement of the Hungarian scanlating scene was that it brought together the fans  forming a base of comics fandom  Although many different websites existed  each specializing in different comics genres  types  European  superhero  independent  manga  underground  etc    Kepregeny net managed to unite all different kind of comics fans  Kepregeny net also started out as a scanlating and scanning website  its forum provided a platform for fans and professionals  artists  editors of earlier series  retailers etc   to meet and discuss all kinds of issues  Many projects were eventually launched from there  and to this day it is a place for fan talk and professional debate and most notably Kepregeny net can be regarded as the main information gateway for all comics fans and professionals  88  2004 can be regarded as the breakthrough year in comics publishing  In February the Complete Maus was released by Ulpius h z  a larger publishing house   The first book of Maus has already been published in the early nineties   Besides the release of the graphic novel  Ulpius organized an exhibition which exposed pages from Maus in Budapest s subway carts  seen by one million passengers a day  The project became successful  and attracted large media attention  107  This project was timed for the 50th anniversary commemoration of the German occupation in March 1944  resulting in the deportation of 800 000 Hungarian Jews and other minorities   This also is revealed in the graphic novel   Another milestone of the year was the publication of the Belgian album series  XIII  This  along with Largo Winch has already been introduced to the Hungarian audience in 1995 as part of the X 07 black and white series in American comic book format  108  That year also brought some changes in Hungarian comics  Endre Sarl s  Szigetv r ostroma  a historical album about the Turkish siege of Szigetv r in 1556  was published and sold at newspaper stands  Unfortunately the pages originally composed in landscape format  were reorganized to portrait A4 format and were paired with weak lettering  109  Attila Fazekas  Botond revived after an 11 year hiatus  94  110  After a long time the first underground comic book anthology  PTSD antol gia appeared  111  112  A group of graphic artists joined forces as Magyar K preg ny Akad mia  Hungarian Comics Academy   a rather self ironic name   113  K pes Kiad   the publishing company of P l Korcsm ros  son and grandson started into a series in which the original Korcsm ros and Rejt  classic comics were rearranged into European styled colored albums  The texts were rewritten  the drawings supplemented and corrected where needed  and colored by the team of Zsolt H  Garisa and Zolt n  Zerge  Varga  This series has started in 2003  114  but 2004 brought larger recognition  Since then many smaller publishers  usually based around one or a few fans themselves  made ventures in releasing comics  These companies provide a very broad variety of comics  some specializing on smaller territories  manga  American mainstream   others representing a larger scale  In 2005 most of these companies forged into the Magyar K preg nykiad k Sz vets ge  Hungarian Comic Publishers  Association   based more on mutual interests and friendship  rather than strict rules and codes  Organizing festivals and fairs can be considered as the organization s biggest success  88  Publishers soon realized that in most cases the newspaper market is far from ideal for comics  however it might be feasible on the book market  This however is a phenomenon seen in many other comic cultures  In the last few years only three companies made efforts on the newspaper market  Panini Comics Italy  four  later two Marvel titles  and K pes Kiad   a black and white budget magazine called Edu rd fapados k preg ny js g  both failed at it  however Pesti k nyv still sends its Lucky Lukes to the newspaper stands  beside bookstores   115  Bookstores have a constantly growing variety on graphic novels  trade paperbacks  albums  etc  88  116  This phenomenon is still new for many Hungarians  since they were used to searching for comics at the newspaper stands shops  tobacconists  etc  In a country with a population around 10 million  these  books  are published in 2 to 5000 copies  which is extremely low  causing relatively high prices  Despite the low number of copies  comics and the theme of its revival has been a frequent topic of the media  88  94  In spite of this  prejudice concerning comics fades very slowly  31  117  Also during this period  comics  own offline printed media has been born in the form of semi fanzine semi professional papers as Panel  Bubor kh moz   bubble peeler   118  The first significant amount of manga were published in the last quarter of 2006 119  and by the end of 2007  it flooded the comics market  120  being the most popular among them  Unlike the second most popular type of comics   superheroes   manga fans have their own fan groups  conventions  and are less interested in other type of comics   edit  Current Scene  edit  Comics published  variety Generally mainstream American and manga comics receive the largest attention from the consumers  121  but the large number of small publishers ensure a wide and colorful variety of comics  119   edit  Manga  oriental comics In 2006 13 8  of the comics published that year for the bookstore market were related to manga global manga  119  122  Although not too many manga were published in 2006  it was the breakthrough of that particular genre  style  stream with rapidly growing publication numbers  119  By 2009 58 1  of the comics published for that same market were manga  123  Apart from a few exceptions  manga published in Hungary usually come from the sh jo and sh nen demographic genres  primarily sh jo   124 Seinen mangas are not as frequent as the prior two demographic genres  some examples include Berserk  Vampire Hunter D  Dominion  Tank Police  Who fighter with Heart of Darkness  Blade of the Phantom Master  Hoshi no Sabaku   Latter is one of few manga  that s first Western edition was made by a Hungarian publisher  125   Rare examples of gekiga comics were published in the international anthology series  Pap rmozi presenting works by artists Yoshihiro Tatsumi  Katsuhiro Otomo   edit  American comics In Hungary American comic book publishing dates back to the late eighties  see The last decade of communist Hungary section in history chapter   but until the middle of the first decade of the new millennium these comics were limited to the superhero genre  Batman  Superman  Spider man  X men  etc    children s  well known titles from the TV screen  Tom and Jerry  Disney characters  etc    humor comics  Garfield   Parallel to the Hungarian comics market moving to the bookstores  publishers put more emphasis on graphic novels  Today Dark Horse Comics and Vertigo titles are just as common editorial picks as DC and Marvel titles  Many groundbreaking  cult comics  graphic novels have their Hungarian edition  i e  Sandman  Batman  Year One  Sin City  Watchmen  Understanding Comics  Maus  etc   In 2006 31 3  of the comics published for the bookstore market were of American origin  claiming the highest portion   122  in 2009  despite the fact that the number of American comics grew by 80   the portion of the total numbers released for the bookstore market decreased to 20 9   123  In connection with American comics in Hungary it is important to point out  that more than half of the comics on the newsstand market are of American origin  A large portion of these are magazines dedicated to popular cartoon series  Tom and Jerry  Cartoon Network magazine  Sponge Bob  Scooby Doo  etc   123  126   edit  European comics Although publishing and distributing European comics dates back to a longer period of time than of American comics  see previous chapters   since the early 1990s most of these comics could not reach the popularity of superhero comics  From the mid nineties to 2004 German Mosaik was the only major European comic book title published in the country  Today many Francophone albums are published in Hungarian  but their print numbers range from a few hundred to one or two thousand  The future of these titles depends much on the enthusiasm and dedication of the editor and publisher  Despite previous publications  Bonelli titles could not reach substantial popularity  Dampyr  which started as an experiment to test cheaper Italian pulp comics  closed after six issues  127  In 2006 17 2  of the comics released for the bookstore market were of European origin  in 2009 this ratio was 12 8   the gross number of publications on the bookstore market grew 3 times between 2006 and 2009   122  123  Interestingly European comics constitute a substantial portion of the comics published for the alternative market  36 2  of the comics on that particular market were of European origin in 2009  This is due to a large number of small print numbered  collector s editions of Mosaik books  123  Despite the smaller sellings in this field  publishers and editors seek contact with European artists resulting in more offbeat publications from Marcel Ruijters  The Netherlands   Gradimir Smudja  Serbia  France   Alexandru  Ciubu  Ciubotariu  Romania   Risto Isom ki  Finland   two books from Aleksandar Zograf  Serbia   Kati Kov cs  Finland   Pieter De Poortere  The Netherlands   etc   edit  Hungarian creations Taking in consideration the wide selection of comics printed in Hungary  comics created by Hungarians only provide a smaller part of the variety  The reason reflects a complex and mainly economic type of problem that has occupied some  for the last two decades  Generally speaking  the small market does not permit the publishing of domestic comics with larger costs than the royalties of foreign materials  88  Even if the publisher can agree with an author or team of authors  it has to take greater risks compared to the already known foreign product  where the reception could be previously estimated  Artists   apart from very few exceptions   make their living from other related graphic fields such as advertisement  animation  therefore devoted artists work on their comics projects in their free time  88  This way artists gain less practice than their professional contemporaries and a project takes longer to reach its final stage  Naturally  the quality and genre of these works strongly vary resulting in readers losing their faith in domestic comics  88  At this point the vicious circle would close in if not for a few publishers devoted to Hungarian comics  And luckily many artists  artist groups decide to take publishing of their own works into their own hands  88  To attract more attention to Hungarian creations  MKSZ founded the Alfab ta prize in 2006 to award domestic authors   The name ironically rhymes and refers to the Hungarian word analfab ta   meaning illiterate  a common offense against comics readers in the past   Comics made by Hungarian creators only make up around 8 1   2009 data  123  of the comics sold in bookstores  This ratio is even less at the newsstands ruled by children s magazine franchises  Cartoon Network  Scooby Doo  Tom and Jerry  etc    The real field for Hungarian authors is the alternative market  where 31 different Hungarian comics were published in 2009  126  And of course cross word puzzle  humor and other type of magazines and periodicals are still a strong flagship of the country s comics  if not the strongest  119  123  126  In 2009 83 artists were active in the sense  that their works were published throughout the year  28 of these artists had under 10 pages of comics published  21 artists between 10 and 19 pages  another 20 artists between 20 and 49 pages  and 14 artists managed to draw over 50 pages that year  128  Short comics under 10 pages are a relatively common form of comics  these are usually published in magazines  comics anthologies  most notably Pinkhell  Nero Blanco Comix  Panel specials  Sushi Strip  or the artist s own collection  Bal zs Gr f s strips  Marabu s Dod  strip series  Napirajz  Daily Drawings   a cult webcomic series  etc    Individual graphic novels  comic books from Hungarian authors are not as common  but luckily each year produces a handful of them  Some of the most well known are Lencsil ny by Istv n Lakatos  Kalyber Joe Kalandjai  The Adventures of Kalyber Joe  by Roland Pilcz  Spir l by Attila Futaki  also published in France   Nokt rn by D niel Csord s  Gemini Jelent s  Gemini report  by Attila Fazekas and Antal Bayer  R v  a H v   Haven  The Caller  by R bert Odegn l  Rejt  Korcsm ros classic comics remakes  However some editors and journalists 129  believe  Hungarian comics have the potential of recruiting more comics fans and reaching a cult status in Hungary  Editor  Antal Bayer speculates in a forum comment   At the same time  I m convinced that a really  up to date  Hungarian comic could reach the cult status  then maintain massive popularity  We ve seen how Napirajz moved the people  but we need something more than that for breakthrough  I can hardly wait for the Hungarian comic book which will be received with as much enthusiasm as the latest Rejt  Korcsm ros reissue   130   edit  Self published comics  minicomics As mentioned before  Hungarian alternative and underground comics reach back to the 1970s  1980s  Usually underground comics appeared in  rock music  fanzines  e g  Dall Ass  Geny  Sz v  Disztroly   Individual underground comic books only appeared in the mid 2000s with publications as PTSD antol gia  2004   131 Sushi Strip  2005   132  The first Hungarian fanzine dedicated to comics is Panel  2006   These publications had an encouraging effect on other comics artists  In 2007 a larger boom happened in the field  many young artists chose to publish their own comic books in 30 300 copies  As in the case of other scenes  these works range from alternative to mainstream like comics  The phenomena continued in 2008  Manga fans are also active in this field  Larger events   especially the annual festival in spring   usually give space to these artists to sell their comics  133   edit  Artists working abroad Only a couple of Hungarian artists so far have been able to work for Western European or US companies  although previously many classic Hungarian comics  works primarily by Z r d  Seb k  Korcsm ros  Fazekas  were translated and published throughout the world  mainly  friendly    meaning socialist   countries as Yugoslavia  East Germany  Cuba  Poland  Czechoslovakia  etc   but some Z r d comics were published in such countries as Sweden  The Netherlands    134  The first was Attila Fazekas  back in 1991  he was the artist on a few issues of the German edition of Ghostbusters   Attila Futaki and Gergely Nikol nyi s Spiral appeared in France in 2008  135  and Futaki is currently working on the comic adaptation of the Lightning Thief series of novels published by Walt Disney  Leslie T jlor s erotic albums are published by the Dutch Sombrero or the Italian E F  Edizioni  136  Zolt n Korcsok had a short story published in Heavy Metal Magazine  137  Henrik Horv th started working as an inker for several independent US companies in 2006  138  some of his works has been published by Image comics  139  Judit Tondora works as a freelance artist  pencil  ink   her works can be seen in comics of independent publishers as Optic Comics  Outlaw Entertainment  140  141  On some of these projects pages are colored by Roland Pilcz  142   edit  Media  edit  Mainstream print Since 2004 2005 comics became a more frequent topic in the press and electronic media  In spite of this  prejudice concerning comics has finally began to fade away  31  Comic book friendly magazines and newspapers  where comics related articles are more frequent include Besz l   Magyar H rlap  Magyar Narancs  N pszabads g  Filmvil g  MoziNet  M  t   edit  Underground print Written periodicals dealing with comics as such  sold at newspaper stands or bookstores do not exist in Hungary  although there are some magazines sold on the direct market  festivals  comic book stores  etc    143  These magazines have a small print number  100 350   resulting in a hybrid between fanzines  editing and publishing by the same person  non profit  authors not paid  and official magazines  ISSN number  well known experts as authors   143 Panel  March 2006   was the first of the kind  followed by Bubor kh moz   March 2007    About the importance of these small print numbered magazines Gyula Maksa  media researcher writes in his book  Variations on Comics  V ltozatok k preg nyre    Although the comics critique has popped up  but it still hasn t made itself independent from the fine art  non illustrated literature and film critique  This could be also changed by Panel  the so called first Hungarian comics fanzine  which from its start seemed as a transition between the traditional fan magazine and a cultural periodical  that is to say  a prozine   144   edit  Internet sites  blogs Hungary s main comics portal is Kepregeny net  The independent portal gathers fans and professionals of the scene  therefore it is the catalyst of many comics projects  events  publications  workshops  etc  The portal has had a major role in the past few year s new wave of comics in the country  Today the site hosts news  review and photo gallery sections  press archive  subpages  bibliographies  comics database  author s webpages   145  As in other countries  Hungarian comics blogs can be divided into three main groups  webcomics  i e  Napirajz   Daily drawing  Fekete Macska   Black Cat     blogs of authors  almost all major authors own a blog  where they display new works

blog won in the Entertainment category  and another comics text blog managed to fit into the top ten  148   edit  Events  edit  Major events Magyar K preg ny Fesztiv l   Hungarian Comics Festival   since 2005  Annual   supposedly the biggest   event every spring  organized by the Hungarian Comic Publishers  Association  The event s main focus is on the programs  debates  meeting artists  presentations  movies  etc    88  149  The association s prize  Alfab ta is also announced during the festival  K preg ny B rze   Comics Exchange Market  These events can be regarded as the most fan oriented events  which explains  why these comics markets are frequently mistranslated to comic cons  comic book conventions   On these events anyone  fans  retailers  publishers  is allowed to sell their own used or new comics  They are held twice a year  spring and fall   The first was held in 2001  88  Hungarocomix  A fair showcasing the publishers  yearly work and products  also organized by the Hungarian Comic Publishers  Association  Usually it takes place a few weeks before Christmas  88  149  In 2010 it was merged with the Christmas season anime  video game  role playing events in a large event hall  causing overall mixed critical responses  150  151  Szegedi K preg nyfesztiv l   Szeged Comics Festival  Since 2009  The only comics festival outside Budapest to reach higher attendance  in 2010 around 700 visitors  and favorable critical response  The festival is organized by the city library of Szeged and the local comics scene  Held in November  152  Caricature and Comics Auction  since 2005  Auction dedicated to comics and caricature original art  It is held every November in the M csarnok since 2005  2010 was the first year when the auction was not held  although according to the organizers  kArton gallery  it is planned to continue in 2011  153   edit  Clubs K preg ny Kedvel k Klubja  KKK in short    Comics Fans  Club  Every last Thursday of the month  They are usually held in kArton gal ria   During late spring or summer the event has usually been held on the terrace of Kultiplex until its closing  in 2008 the summer scene moved to Szimpla kert  154   Every month a theme is discussed and special guests  hosts are invited  The  club  is open to all people  but usually most of the audience consists of veteran fans and professionals  88  155   edit  Official organizations MKSz   Magyar K preg ny Sz vets g   Hungarian Comics Association  until 2010  Magyar K preg nykiad k Sz vets ge   Hungarian Comics Publishers Association  The Association was founded in 2005 by 5 comics publishing companies  ADOC Semic  K pes Kiad   Krak  Ratius  M ves C h   later most smaller publishing companies joined  It s main goal was to amend the reputation of comics in Hungary  to multiply the number of comics published and to organize an annual comics festival  In 2010 the association decided to reform itself from its base  leaving the word publisher out of its name  it opened memberships status to the public  positioning itself from a publisher s association to a fan association  156  This move attracted some heavy criticism  157  MKA   Magyar K preg ny Akad mia   Hungarian Comics Academy Found in May 2004 as a comics artist collective  Hence the rather self ironic naming the association does not represent any official   academic  artistic view  and is not involved in teaching activities  MKA s main activities are organizing exhibitions  producing and publishing their own magazine  Pinkhell  113  In 2010 the organization melted into MKSZ  156  Although the academy is the only artist collective to form as an official organization  some other artist groups were formed in the past  and many artists choose to work as independents   edit  Awards Main article  Winners and nominees of Hungarian comic awards To attract more attention to Hungarian creations  MKSZ founded the Alfab ta prize in 2006 to award domestic authors   The name ironically rhymes and refers to the Hungarian word analfab ta   meaning illiterate  a common offense against comics readers in the past  31   It is presented at the Hungarian Comics Festival every spring  156  Every year since 2005  Kepregeny net gives place to the annual audience polls  These cover many more topics  not only Hungarian comics  but also translated materials  journalists  etc  158   edit  Distribution Comic publications fall into one or more of the following three distributional categories  newsstands  bookstores  alternative  similar to direct market   159  Comics have been shifting towards bookstores since 2004  and the alternative market is widening every year   edit  Newspaper stands Traditionally  comics were sold at newspaper stands  89  with only very few exceptions in bookstores until the middle of the first decade of the new millennium  citation needed  Leaving the low point of 2001 2003 behind  when very few comics were published  most publishing companies decided on releasing their comics to the bookstore market  A major exception from this is the group of children s comics and children s magazines  containing comics  Since 2006 magazines usually based on cartoon characters and containing gadgets  i e  Cartoon Network magazine  Sponge Bob  Scooby Doo  Spiderman  Totally Spies  etc   flooded the market  Due to these publications  newspaper stand comics still put out 55 7  of the comics published that year  although comics made for older readers are rare  123  126  The fact that many series released for newsstands in the period between 1990 and 2003  now   after their relaunching   can be found at bookstores  i e  Tintin  Asterix  Batman  Marvel titles  etc    illustrates the trend  It is important to point out that indirectly many Hungarian comics can be bought in this particular circulation  since cross word puzzle and other magazines still publish comics   edit  Bookstores Since 2004 2005 smaller publishing companies have targeted the bookstores for its conditions better suit comic book publishing  smaller copy number required to cover the network  88  products are longer time in market compared to newspaper stands   In Hungary a book s average  rotational index  is 1 5  meaning that it takes one and a half years until a book is sold on the market    160  In 2003   about one or two years before the trend started   only 8 6  of the comics published were distributed through bookstores  while 89 7  were sold at newspaper stands  In 2009 these ratios changed drastically  28 67  of the comics published were purchasable at bookstores  and 55 67  of the comic books accessible at the newsstands  The number of books sold at bookstores grew 8 6 times  while the number of comic books distributed through the newspaper chains grew 1 6 times since 2003  123  161  As pointed out previously  not only the number of comics differ between comics sold at newspaper stands and bookstores  but their content  audience  format and prices  126   The average price of a comic book at a newspaper stand in 2009 was 716 8 HUF  a bookstore comics  average price was 2177 8 HUF   123  161  This of course counter reacts to the type and format of comics published today  For example  after Panini s comic book series Hihetetlen P kember  Amazing Spiderman  folded in January 2008  a smaller company  Kingpin continued the series at the bookstores in tpb format  K preg ny Nagyker  Comics Wholesale  as a middle chain helps the large number of smaller companies reach the bookstores effectively  The company also represents the publishing companies at book fares and some other events  88   edit  Alternative This form covers comic book stores  comics events  direct ordering from the publisher  and shops directly connected with the publisher  Not only self published fanzines and comic books  but most small publishing companies rely on this distributional form  since the bookstore distributional system s 45 55  share  wholesale company   bookstore or bookstore chain together  can be reduced or in some cases even eliminated  162  Another reason why Hungarian publishers prefer direct sales is that the Hungarian bookshop distributional system is based on commission system  where the publisher is not paid in advance by the distributor  only after the sold pieces  160  while at an event the publisher receives substantial income immediately  This makes larger direct discounts possible  therefore many fans choose to buy their comics at larger comics events  typically the  b rze  s  festivals   This together leads to a yearly routine  where most companies time their publications to the aforementioned larger events  88  Comics exclusively distributed through alternative methods put out a large portion of the overall number of the comic books published  In 2009 this ratio was 15 67   123  126  The ratio of Hungarian comics published through this distributional form is conspicuously high  in 2009 59 6  of the comics in this network were of Hungarian origin  126  while 68 3  of the Hungarian comics published were only available through alternative distribution  123  Therefore this distributional system is regarded as the primary source for domestic comics  126   edit  Comic book shops Hungarian stores specializing in comic books are relatively rare  and are usually based on comic book import  163  Since the mid nineties a handful  1 4  of shops in Budapest have been serving the fan needs exceeding the variety provided by Hungarian publishers  not counting online shops and shops with only a complementary profile of comics   Edu rd k preg nybolt  Edu rd comics store  was the first specializing in Hungarian comics and had the widest variety of small print number  self published comic books  The store closed in 2009  two years after its opening  164  165  As of January 2011  Trillian  specializing in current American and Manga titles  can be regarded as the most stable shop  running since 2004  166   edit  Webshops Most comic book publishing companies have their own web shops  where the readers can purchase comics directly from the publisher  Comic book shops also have their web based mail ordering feature  Besides these  Comics Invest can be regarded as the only web based distributional source with a wide variety of Hungarian and import comics  citation needed   edit  Museums kArton gal ria   kArton Galery Opened in 2001  Gallery dedicated to comics and caricature art  The gallery has the greatest collection of Hungarian
