Biography Barks was born in Merrill  Oregon to William Barks and his wife Arminta Johnson  He had an older brother named Clyde  Barks once stated that his paternal ancestors were Dutch and his maternal ancestors were Scottish  His paternal grandparents were David Barks and his wife Ruth Shrum  His maternal grandparents were Carl Johnson and his wife Suzanna Massey  but little else is known about his ancestors  Barks was the descendant of Jacob Barks who came to Missouri from North Carolina around 1800  They lived in Marble Hill in Bollinger County  Jacob Barks  son Isaac was the father of the David Barks noted above  Source 1850 census  Goodspeed s History of Southeast Missouri  1888  Find a Grave   edit  Childhood According to Barks  description of his childhood  he was a rather lonely child  His parents owned one square mile  2 6 km   of land that served as their farm  The nearest neighbor lived half a mile  800 m  away  but he was more an acquaintance to Barks  parents than a friend  The closest school was about two miles  3 km  away and Barks had to walk that distance every day  The rural area had few children  though  and Barks later remembered that his school had only about eight or ten students including him  He had high praise for the quality of the education he received in that small school   Schools were good in those days   he used to say  The lessons lasted from nine o clock in the morning to four o clock in the afternoon and then he had to return to the farm  There he remembered not having anybody to talk to  as his parents were busy and he had little in common with his brother  In 1908  William Barks  in an attempt to increase the family income  moved with his family to Midland  Oregon  some miles north of Merrill  to be closer to the new railway lines  He established a new stock breeding farm and sold his produce to the local slaughterhouses  Nine year old Clyde and seven year old Carl worked long hours there  But Carl later remembered that the crowd which gathered at Midland s market place made a strong impression on him  This was expected  as he was not used to crowds up until then  According to Barks  his attention was mostly drawn to the cowboys that frequented the market with their revolvers  strange nicknames for each other and sense of humor  By 1911  they had been successful enough to move to Santa Rosa  California  There they started cultivating vegetables and set up some orchards  Unfortunately  the profits were not as high as William expected and they started having financial difficulties  William s anxiety over them was probably what caused his first nervous breakdown  As soon as William recovered  he made the decision to move back to Merrill  The year was 1913  and Barks was already 12 years old  but  due to the constant moving  he had not yet managed to complete grade school  He resumed his education at this point and finally managed to graduate in 1916  1916 served as a turning point in Barks  life for various reasons  First  Arminta  his mother  died in this year  Second  his hearing problems  which had already appeared earlier  had at the time become severe enough for him to have difficulties listening to his teachers talking  His hearing would continue to get worse later  but at that point he had not yet acquired a hearing aid  Later in life  he couldn t do without one  Third  the closest high school to their farm was five miles  8 km  away and even if he did enlist in it  his bad hearing was likely to contribute to his learning problems  He had to decide to stop his school education  much to his disappointment   edit  From job to job Barks started taking various jobs but had little success in such occupations as a farmer  woodcutter  turner  mule driver  cowboy and printer  From his jobs he learned  he later averred  how eccentric  stubborn and unpredictable men  animals and machines can be  At the same time he interacted with colleagues  fellow breadwinners who had satirical disposition towards even their worst troubles  Barks later declared that he was sure that if not for a little humor in their troubled lives  they would certainly go insane  It was an attitude towards life that Barks would adopt  Later he would say it was natural for him to satirize the secret yearnings and desires  the pompous style and the disappointments of his characters  According to Barks  this period of his life would later influence his best known fictional characters  Walt Disney s Donald Duck and his own Scrooge McDuck  Donald s drifting from job to job was reportedly inspired by Barks  own experiences  So was his usual lack of success  And even in those that he was successful this would be temporary  just until a mistake or chance event caused another failure  another disappointment for the frustrated duck  Barks also reported that this was another thing he was familiar with  Scrooge s main difference to Donald  according to Barks  was that he too had faced the same difficulties in his past but through intelligence  determination and hard work  he was able to overcome them  Or  as Scrooge himself would say to Huey  Dewey and Louie  by being  tougher than the toughies and smarter than the smarties   Even in the present of his stories Scrooge would work to solve his many problems  even though the stories would often point out that his constant efforts seemed futile at the end  In addition  Scrooge was quite similar to his creator in appearing often to be as melancholic  introspective and secretive as he was  Through both characters Barks would often exhibit his rather sarcastic sense of humor  It seems that this difficult period for the artist helped shape many of his later views in life that were expressed through his characters   edit  Professional artist At the same time Barks had started thinking about turning a hobby that he always enjoyed into a profession  that of drawing  Since his early childhood he spent his free time by drawing on any material he could find  He had attempted to improve his style by copying the drawings of his favorite comic strip artists from the newspapers where he could find them  As he later said  he wanted to create his own facial expressions  figures and comical situations in his drawings but wanted to study the master comic artists  use of the pen and their use of color and shading  Among his early favorites were Winsor McCay  mostly known for Little Nemo  and Frederick Burr Opper  mostly known for Happy Hooligan  but he would later study any style that managed to draw his attention  At 16 he was mostly self taught but at this point he decided to take some lessons through correspondence  He only followed the first four lessons and then had to stop because his working left him with little free time  But as he later said  the lessons proved very useful in improving his style  By December 1918  he left his father s home to attempt to find a job in San Francisco  California  He worked for a while in a small publishing house while attempting to sell his drawings to newspapers and other printed material with little success   edit  First marriage While he continued drifting through various jobs  he met Pearl Turner  1904 1987   In 1921 they married and had two daughters  Peggy Barks  born in 1923  Dorothy Barks  born in 1924  In 1923 he returned to his paternal farm in Merrill in an attempt to return to the life of a farmer  but that ended soon  He continued searching for a job while attempting to sell his drawings  He soon managed to sell some of them to Judge magazine and then started having success submitting to the Minneapolis based Calgary Eye Opener  a racy men s cartoon magazine of the era  He was eventually hired as editor and scripted and drew most of the contents while continuing to sell occasional work to other magazines  His salary of 90 dollars a month was considered respectable enough for the time  A facsimile of one of the racy magazines he did cartoons for in this period  Coo Coo  1  was published by Hamilton Comics in 1997  Meanwhile he had his first divorce  He and Pearl were separated in 1929 and divorced in 1930  After he moved to Minneapolis  Minnesota  where Calgary Eye Opener had its offices he met Clara Balken who in 1938 became his second wife   edit  Disney In November 1935  when he learned that Walt Disney was seeking more artists for his Studio  Barks decided to apply  He was approved for a try out which entailed a move to Los Angeles  California  He was one of two in his class of trainees who was hired  His starting salary was 20 dollars a week  He started at Disney Studios in 1935  more than a year after the debut of Donald Duck on June 9  1934 in the short animated film The Wise Little Hen  Barks initially worked as an inbetweener  This involved being teamed and supervised by one of the head animators who did the key poses of character action  often known as extremes  for which the inbetweeners did the drawings between the extremes to create the illusion of movement  While an inbetweener  Barks submitted gag ideas for cartoon story lines being developed and showed such a knack for creating comical situations that by 1937 he was transferred to the story department  His first story sale was the climax of Modern Inventions  for a sequence where a robot barber chair gives Donald Duck a haircut on his butt  In 1937 when Donald Duck became the star of his own series of cartoons instead of co starring with Mickey Mouse and Goofy as previously  a new unit of storymen and animators was created devoted solely to this series  Though he originally just contributed gag ideas to some duck cartoons by 1937 Barks was  principally with partner Jack Hannah  originating story ideas that were storyboarded and  if approved by Walt  put into production  He collaborated on such cartoons as Donald s Nephews  1938   Donald s Cousin Gus  1939   Mr  Duck Steps Out  1940  Timber  1941   The Vanishing Private  1942  and The Plastics Inventor  1944    edit  The Good Duck Artist Omelet opening page Unhappy at the emerging wartime working conditions at Disney plus bothered by ongoing sinus problems caused by the studio s air conditioning  Barks quit in 1942  Shortly before quitting  he moonlighted as a comic book artist  contributing half the artwork for a one shot comic book  the other half of the art being done by story partner Jack Hannah  titled Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold  This 64 page story was adapted by Donald Duck comic strip writer Bob Karp from an unproduced feature  and published in October 1942 in  Dell  Four Color Comics  9  It was the first Donald Duck story originally produced for an American comic book and also the first involving Donald and his nephews in a treasure hunting expedition  in this case for the treasure of Henry Morgan  Barks would later use the treasure hunting theme in many of his stories  This actually was not his first work in comics  as earlier the same year Barks along with Hannah and fellow storyman Nick George scripted Pluto Saves the Ship  which was among the first original Disney comic book stories published in the United States  After quitting the Studio  Barks relocated to the Hemet San Jacinto area in the semi desert inland empire region east of Los Angeles where he hoped to start a chicken farm  When asked which of his stories was a favorite in several interviews Barks cited the ten pager in Walt Disney s Comics and Stories  146  Nov  1952  in which Donald tells the story of the chain of unfortunate events that took place when he owned a chicken farm in a town which subsequently was re named Omelet  Likely one reason it was a favorite is that it was inspired by Barks  own experiences in the poultry business  But to earn a living in the meantime he inquired whether Western Publishing  which had published Pirate Gold  had any need for artists for Donald Duck comic book stories  He was immediately assigned to illustrate the script for a ten page Donald Duck story for the monthly Walt Disney s Comics and Stories  At the publisher s invitation he revised the storyline and the improvements impressed the editor sufficiently to invite Barks to try his hand at contributing both the script and the artwork of his follow up story  This set the pattern for Barks  career in that  with rare exceptions  he provided art  pencil  inking  solid blacks and lettering  and scripting for his stories  The Victory Garden  that initial ten page story published in April  1943 was the first of about 500 stories featuring the Disney ducks Barks would produce for Western Publishing over the next three decades  well into his purported retirement  These can be mostly divided into two categories  Ten pagers  comedic Donald Duck stories that were the lead for the monthly flagship title Walt Disney s Comics and Stories  whose circulation peaked in the mid 1950s at 3 million copies sold a month  Humorous adventure stories  usually 24 32 pages in length  In the 1940s these were one shots in the Four Color series  issued 4 6 times a year  that starred Donald and his nephews  Barks transitioned his skills as an animator artist and storyman into those of a comic artist and writer  notably in his longer adventure tales  According to critic Geoffrey Blum  the process that saw its beginnings in 1942 s Pirate Gold first bore its full fruit in 1950 s Vacation Time   which he describes as  a visual primer for reading comics and understanding    the form      2  From the early 1950s Barks undertook the quarterly adventures of Uncle Scrooge and the duck clan in Scrooge s own title  He surrounded Donald Duck and nephews Huey  Dewey and Louie with a cast of eccentric and colorful characters  such as the aforementioned Scrooge McDuck  the wealthiest duck in the world  Gladstone Gander  Donald s obscenely lucky cousin  inventor Gyro Gearloose  the persistent Beagle Boys  the sorceress Magica De Spell  Scrooge s rivals Flintheart Glomgold and John D  Rockerduck  Daisy s nieces April  May and June  Donald s neighbor Jones  and The Junior Woodchucks organization   edit  No longer anonymous People who work for Disney generally do so in relative anonymity  the stories only carry Walt Disney s name and  sometimes  a short identification number  Prior to 1960  the creator of these stories remained a mystery to his readers  However  many readers recognized Barks  work and drawing style  and began to call him the Good Duck Artist  a label which stuck even after his true identity was discovered by John and Bill Spicer in 1959  After Barks received a 1960 visit from Bill and John Spicer and Ron Leonard  he was no longer anonymous  as his name soon became known to his readers  3  Barks stories  whether humorous adventures or domestic comedies  often exhibited a wry  dark irony born of hard experience  The ten pagers showcased Donald as everyman  struggling against the cruel bumps and bruises of everyday life with the nephews often acting as a Greek chorus commenting on the unfolding disasters Donald wrought upon himself  Yet while seemingly defeatist in tone  the humanity of the characters shines through in their persistence despite the obstacles  These stories found popularity not only among young children but adults as well  Despite the fact that Barks had done little traveling his adventure stories often had the duck clan globe trotting to the most remote or spectacular of places  This allowed Barks to indulge his penchant for elaborate backgrounds that hinted at his thwarted ambitions of doing realistic stories in the vein of Hal Foster s Prince Valiant   edit  Third marriage As Barks blossomed creatively  his marriage to Clara deteriorated  This is the period referred to in Barks  famed quip that he could feel his creative juices flowing while the whiskey bottles hurled at him by a tipsy Clara flew by his head  They were divorced in 1951  his second and last divorce  In this period Barks dabbled in fine art  exhibiting paintings at local art shows  It was at one of these in 1952 he became acquainted with fellow exhibitor Margaret Wynnfred Williams  1917   March 10  1993   nicknamed Gar   She was an accomplished landscape artist  some of whose paintings are in the collection of the Leanin  Tree Museum of Western Art  During her lifetime  and to this day  note cards of her paintings are available from Leanin  Tree  Her nickname appears as a store name in the story  Christmas in Duckburg   featured on page 1 of Walt Disney s Christmas Parade  9  published in 1958  Soon after they met  she started assisting Barks  handling the solid blacks and lettering  both of which he had found onerous  They married in 1954 and the union lasted until her death   edit  Later life Carl Barks visiting Finland in June  1994  Carl Barks retired in 1966 but was persuaded by editor Chase Craig to script stories for Western  The last new comic book story drawn by Carl Barks was a Daisy Duck tale   The Dainty Daredevil   published in Walt Disney Comics Digest issue 5  Nov  1968   When bibliographer Michael Barrier asked Barks about why he drew it  Barks  vague recollection was no one was available and he was asked to do it as a favor by editor Chase Craig  He wrote one Uncle Scrooge story  three Donald Duck stories and from 1970 1974 was the main writer for the Junior Woodchucks comic book  issues 6 through 25   The latter included environmental themes that Barks first explored in 1957   Land of the Pygmy Indians   Uncle Scrooge  18   Barks also sold a few sketches to Western that were redrawn as covers  For a time the Barkses lived in Goleta  California before returning to the Inland Empire by moving to Temecula  To make a little extra money beyond what his pension and scripting earnings brought in  Barks started doing oil paintings to sell at the local art shows where he and Gar  exhibited  Subjects included humorous depictions of life on the farm and portraits of Native American princesses  These skillfully rendering paintings encouraged fan Glenn Bray to ask Barks if he could commission a painting of the ducks   A Tall Ship and a Star to Steer Her By   taken from the cover of Walt Disney s Comics and Stories  108 by Barks   This prompted Barks to contact George Sherman at Disney s Publications Department to request permission to produce and sell oil paintings of scenes from his stories  In July 1971 Barks was granted a royalty free license by Disney  4  When word spread that Barks was taking commissions from those interested in purchasing an oil of the ducks  much to his astonishment the response quickly outstripped what he reasonably could produce in the next few years  Ode to the Disney Ducks They ride tall ships to the far away  and see the long ago  They walk where fabled people trod  and Yetis trod the snow  They meet the folks who live on stars  and find them much like us  With food and love and happiness the things they most discuss  The world is full of clans and cults abuzz as angry bees  And Junior Woodchucks snapping jeers at Littlest Chickadees  The ducks show us that part of life is to forgive a slight  That black eyes given in revenge keep hatred burning bright  So when our walks in sun or shade pass graveyards filled by wars  It s nice to stop and read of ducks whose battles leave no scars  To read of ducks who parody our vain attempts at glory  They don t exist  but somehow leave us glad we bought their story  Carl Barks   1999 When Barks expressed dismay at coping with the backlog of orders he faced  fan dealers Bruce Hamilton and Russ Cochran suggested Barks instead auction his paintings at conventions and via Cochran s catalog Graphic Gallery  By September 1974 Barks had discontinued taking commissions  5  At Boston s NewCon convention  in October 1975  the first Carl Barks oil painting auctioned at a comic book convention   She Was Spangled and Flashy   sold for  2 500  Subsequent offerings saw an escalation in the prices realized  The buyer of this painting  Jerry Osborne  quickly became one of Barks  close friends  Barks even painted Osborne into the scene of his 1976  July Fourth in Duckburg   Jerry Osborne delivered the eulogy at Barks  funeral at Grants Pass  Oregon  citation needed  In 1976  Barks and Gar  went to Boston for the NewCon show  their first comic convention appearance  Among the other attendees was famed Little Lulu comic book scripter John Stanley  despite both having worked for Western Publishing this was the first time they met  The highlight of the convention was the auctioning of what was to that time the largest duck oil painting Barks had done   July Fourth in Duckburg   which included depictions of several prominent Barks fans and collectors  It sold for a then record high amount   6 400  Soon thereafter a fan sold unauthorized prints of some of the Scrooge McDuck paintings  leading Disney to withdraw permission for further paintings  To meet demand for new work Barks embarked on a series of paintings of non Disney ducks and fantasy subjects such as Beowulf and Xerxes  These were eventually collected in the limited edition book Animal Quackers  As the result of heroic efforts by Star Wars producer Gary Kurtz and screenwriter Edward Summer  Disney relented and in 1981  allowed Barks to do a now seminal oil painting called  Wanderers of Wonderlands  for a breakthrough limited edition book entitled Uncle Scrooge McDuck  His Life and Times  The book collected 11 classic Barks stories of Uncle Scrooge colored by artist Peter Ledger along with a new Scrooge story by Barks done storybook style with watercolor illustrations   Go Slowly  Sands of Time   After being turned down by every major publisher in New York City  Kurtz and Summer published the book through Celestial Arts  which Kurtz acquired partly for this purpose  The book went on to become the model for virtually every important collection of comic book stories  It was the first book of its kind ever reviewed in Time Magazine and subsequently in Newsweek  and the first book review in Time Magazine with large color illustrations  In 1977 and 1982  Barks attended the San Diego Comic Con  As with his appearance in Boston  the response to his presence was overwhelming  with long lines of fans waiting to meet Barks and get his autograph  In 1981  Bruce Hamilton and Russ Cochran  two long time Disney comics fans  decided to combine forces to bring greater recognition to the works of Carl Barks  Their first efforts went into establishing Another Rainbow Publishing  the banner under which they produced and issued the award winning book   The Fine Art of Walt Disney s Donald Duck by Carl Barks   a comprehensive collection of the Disney duck paintings of this artist and storyteller  Not long after  the company began producing fine art lithographs of many of these paintings  in strictly limited editions  all signed by Barks  who eventually produced many original works for the series  In 1983 Another Rainbow took up the daunting task of collecting the entire Disney comic book ouvr  of Barks over 500 stories in all in the ten set  thirty volume Carl Barks Library  These oversized hardbound volumes reproduced Barks  pages in pristine black and white line art  as close as possible to the way he would originally drawn them  and included mountains of special features  articles  reminiscences  interviews  storyboards  critiques  and more than a few surprises  This monumental project was finally completed in mid 1990  In 1985 a new division was founded  Gladstone Publishing  which took up the then dormant Disney comic book license  Gladstone introduced a whole new generation of Disney comic book readers to the wondrous storytelling of such luminaries as Barks  Paul Murry  and Floyd Gottfredson  as well as presenting the first works of modern Disney comics masters Don Rosa and William Van Horn  Seven years after Gladstone s founding  the Carl Barks Library was revived as full color  high quality squarebound comic albums  including the first ever Carl Barks trading cards    the Carl Barks Library in Color  Barks relocated one last time to Grants Pass  Oregon near where he grew up  partly at the urging of friend and Broom Hilda artist Russell Myers  who lived in the area  The move also was motivated  Barks stated in another famous quip  by Temecula being too close to Disneyland and thus facilitating a growing torrent of drop in visits by vacationing fans  In this period Barks made only one public appearance  at a comic book shop near Grants Pass  From 1993 to 1998  Barks  career was managed by the  Carl Barks Studio   Bill Grandey and Kathy Morby They had sold Barks original art since 1979   This involved numerous art projects and activities  including a tour of 11 European countries in 1994  Iceland being the first foreign country he ever visited  Barks appeared at the first of many Disneyana conventions in 1993  Silk screen prints of paintings along with high end art objects  such as original water colors  bronze figurines and ceramic tiles  were produced based on designs by Barks  During the summer of 1994 and until his death  Carl Barks  amp  his studio personally assigned Peter Reichelt  a museum exhibition producer from Mannheim  Germany  as his agent for Europe  Publisher  Edition 313  put out numerous lithographs  In 1997  tensions between Barks and the Studio eventually resulted in a lawsuit that was settled with an agreement that included the disbanding of the Studio  Barks never traveled to make another Disney appearance  He was represented by Rev  Ed Bergen  as he completed a final project  Gerry Tank and Jim Mitchell were to assist Barks in his final years  During his Carl Barks Studio years  Barks created two more stories  the script for the final Uncle Scrooge story  Horsing Around with History   which was first published in Denmark in 1994 with Bill Van Horn art  The Barks outlines for Barks final Donald Duck story  Somewhere in Nowhere   were first published in 1997  in Italy  with art by Pat Block  Austrian artist Gottfried Helnwein curated and organized the first solo museum exhibition of Carl Barks  Between 1994 and 1998 the retrospective was shown in ten European museums and seen by more than 400 000 visitors  6  At the same time in spring 1994  Reichelt and Ina Brockmann designed a special museum exhibition tour about Barks  life and work  Also represented for the first time at this exhibition were Disney artists Al Taliaferro and Floyd Gottfredson  Since 1995  more than 500 000 visitors have attended the shows in Europe  Reichelt also translated the Michael Barrier Barks biography into German and published it in 1994   edit  Final days and death Still living in a new home in Grants Pass  Oregon which he and Gar  had built next door to their original home  Barks died in 2000 at the age of 99  seven years after Gar  had died  Although he was undergoing chemotherapy for leukemia he was  according to caregiver Serene Hunickle   funny up to the end    edit  Barks  influence Barks  Donald Duck stories were rated  7 on Comic s Journal list of 100 top comics  his Uncle Scrooge stories were rated  20  Steven Spielberg and George Lucas have acknowledged that the rolling boulder booby trap in the opening scene of Raiders of the Lost Ark was inspired by the 1954 Carl Barks Uncle Scrooge adventure  The Seven Cities of Cibola   Uncle Scrooge  7   Lucas and Spielberg have also said that some of Barks s stories about space travel and the depiction of aliens had an influence on them  7  Lucas wrote the foreword to the 1982 Uncle Scrooge McDuck  His Life and Times  In it he calls Barks s stories  cinematic  and  a priceless part of our literary heritage   The Walt Disney Treasures DVD set Chronological Donald  Volume 2

pong balls  In December 1965 Karl Kr yer  a Dane  lifted the sunken freight vessel Al Kuwait in the Kuwait Harbor by filling the hull with 27 million tiny inflatable balls of polystyrene  8  Although the suggestion is often made  Kr yer denies having been inspired by this Barks story  Some sources claim Kr yer was denied a Dutch patent registration  application number NL 6514306  for his invention on the grounds that the Barks story was a prior publication of the invention  However no definite proof of this story is available  9  10  Kr yer later successfully raised another ship off Greenland using the same method  and several other sunken vessels worldwide have since been raised by modified versions of this concept  The television show MythBusters also tested this method and was able to raise a small boat  For those currently drawing Disney Duck comics  the influence of Barks cannot be overstated  For artists such as Daan Jippes and Freddy Milton  Barks  comics have made a great impact  Don Rosa  one of the most popular living Disney artists  and possibly the one who has been most keen on connecting the various stories into a coherent universe and chronology  considers  with few exceptions  all Barks  duck stories as canon  and all others as apocryphal  Rosa has said that a number of novelists and movie makers cite Carl Barks as their  major influence and inspiration   11  The popularity of Barks  work in Europe is high  and has been that way for years  When the news of Barks  passing was hardly covered by the press in America   in Europe the sad news was flashed instantly across the airwaves and every newspaper   they realized the world had lost one of the most beloved  influential and well known creators in international culture   12  Dozens of noted comic book artists have taken up elements of Barks  style  especially his ink and pen work  citation needed  In the US elements of Barks  oil painting style of the ducks were evident in the computer

Barks was an enthusiastic user of Esterbrook pens  He particularly used a N  356 model to ink and letter his Donald Duck comic book pages  15        I used a  356 Esterbrook art and drafting pen which could do everything from thin  fadeaways  to broad accented curve sweeps on foreground circles such as the ducks  forms  The trick of breaking in a new pen  I discovered  is to soak it for several minutes in the ink bottle  Then wipe off the ink and the pen s varnish  For some weird reason most new pens then start out flexible and free flowing      Letter to Scott Matheson  March 21  1973   16
