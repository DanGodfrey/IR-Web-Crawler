Afrikaans  Republiek van Namibi   German  Republik Namibia   is a country in southern Africa whose western border is the Atlantic Ocean  It shares land borders with Angola and Zambia to the north  Botswana to the east and South Africa to the south and east  It gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990  following the Namibian War of Independence  Its capital and largest city is Windhoek  Namibia is a member state of the United Nations  UN   the Southern African Development Community  SADC   the African Union  AU   and the Commonwealth of Nations  The dry lands of Namibia were inhabited since early times by Bushmen  Damara  and Namaqua  and since about the 14th century AD by immigrating Bantu who came with the Bantu expansion  It became a German Imperial protectorate in 1884 and remained a German colony until the end of World War I  In 1920  the League of Nations mandated the country to South Africa  which imposed its laws and  from 1948  its apartheid policy  Uprisings and demands by African leaders led the UN to assume direct responsibility over the territory  It recognized the South West Africa People s Organization  SWAPO  as the official representative of the Namibian people in 1973  Namibia  however  remained under South African administration during this time  Following internal violence  South Africa installed an interim administration in Namibia in 1985  Namibia obtained full independence from South Africa in 1990  with the exception of Walvis Bay and the Penguin Islands  which remained under South African control until 1994  Namibia has a population of 2 1 million people and a stable multi party parliamentary democracy  Agriculture  herding  tourism and the mining industry   including mining for gem diamonds  uranium  gold  silver  and base metals   form the backbone of Namibia s economy  Given the presence of the arid Namib Desert  it is one of the least densely populated countries in the world  Approximately half the population live below the international poverty line  and the nation has suffered heavily from the effects of HIV AIDS  with 15  of the adult population infected with HIV in 2007  Contents 1 History 1 1 Pre

be the oldest desert in the world  4  Before its independence in 1990  the area was known first as German South West Africa  Deutsch S dwestafrika   then as South West Africa  reflecting the colonial occupation by the Germans and the South Africans  technically on behalf of the British crown reflecting South Africa s dominion status within the British Empire    edit  Pre colonial period The dry lands of Namibia were inhabited since early times by Bushmen  Damara  Nama  and since about the 14th century AD  by immigrating Bantu who came with the Bantu expansion from central Africa  From the late 18th century onwards  Orlam clans from the Cape Colony crossed the Orange River and moved into the area that today is southern Namibia  5  Their encounters with the nomadic Nama tribes were largely peaceful  The missionaries accompanying the Orlams were well received by them  6  the right to use waterholes and grazing was granted against an annual payment  7  On their way further northwards  however  the Orlams encountered clans of the Herero tribe at Windhoek  Gobabis  and Okahandja which were less accommodating  The Nama Herero War broke out in 1880  with hostilities ebbing only when Imperial Germany deployed troops to the contested places and cemented the status quo between Nama  Orlams  and Herero  8  The first Europeans to disembark and explore the region were the Portuguese navigators Diogo C o in 1485 and Bartolomeu Dias in 1486  still the region was not claimed by the Portuguese crown  However  like most of Sub Saharan Africa  Namibia was not extensively explored by Europeans until the 19th century  when traders and settlers arrived  principally from Germany and Sweden  In the late 19th century Dorsland trekkers crossed the area on their way from the Transvaal to Angola  Some of them settled in Namibia instead of continuing their journey  even more returned to South West African territory after the Portuguese tried to convert them to Catholicism and forbade their language at schools  9   edit  German rule Namibia became a German colony in 1884 to forestall British encroachment and was known as German South West Africa  Deutsch S dwestafrika   10  However  the Palgrave mission by the British governor in Cape Town had determined that only the natural deep water harbour of Walvis Bay  Walfisch in German  Walvis in Afrikaans  Whale in English  was worth occupying   and this was annexed to the Cape province of British South Africa  From 1904 to 1907  the Herero and the Namaqua took up arms against the Germans and in the subsequent Herero and Namaqua genocide  10 000 Nama  half the population  and approximately 65 000 Hereros  about 80  of the population  were killed  11  12  The survivors  when finally released from detention  were subjected to a policy of dispossession  deportation  forced labor  racial segregation and discrimination in a system that in many ways anticipated apartheid  Most Africans were confined to so called native territories  which later under South African rule post 1949 were turned into  homelands   Bantustans   Indeed  some historians have speculated that the German genocide in Namibia was a model used by Nazis in the Holocaust  13  but most scholars say that episode was not especially influential for the Nazis  who were children at the time citation needed   However  the father of Luftwaffe commander Hermann G ring was a one time German colonial governor of Namibia and has a street named after him in Swakopmund  14  The memory of genocide remains relevant to ethnic identity in independent Namibia and to relations with Germany  15   edit  South African rule and the struggle for independence South Africa occupied the colony in 1915 after defeating the German force during World War I and administered it as a League of Nations mandate territory from 1919  Although the South African government desired to incorporate  South West Africa  into its territory  it never officially did so  although it was administered as the de facto  fifth province   with the white minority having representation in the whites only Parliament of South Africa  as well as electing their own local administration the SWA Legislative Assembly  The South African government also appointed the SWA administrator  who had extensive powers  Following the League s supersession by the United Nations in 1946  South Africa refused to surrender its earlier mandate to be replaced by a United Nations Trusteeship agreement  requiring closer international monitoring of the territory s administration  along with a definite independence schedule   The Herero Chief s Council submitted a number of petitions to the UN calling for it to grant Namibia independence during the 1950s  During the 1960s  when European powers granted independence to their colonies and trust territories in Africa  pressure mounted on South Africa to do so in Namibia  In 1966 the International Court of Justice dismissed a complaint brought by Ethiopia and Liberia against South Africa s continued presence in the territory  but the U N  General Assembly subsequently revoked South Africa s mandate  while in 1971 the International Court of Justice issued an  advisory opinion  declaring South Africa s continued administration to be illegal  16  In response to the 1966 ruling by the International Court of Justice  South West Africa People s Organisation  SWAPO  military wing  People s Liberation Army of Namibia  a guerrilla group began their armed struggle for independence  17  but it was not until 1988 that South Africa agreed to end its occupation 18  of Namibia  in accordance with a UN peace plan for the entire region  During the South African occupation of Namibia  white commercial farmers  most of whom came as settlers from South Africa and represented 0 2  of the national population  owned 74  of arable land  19  Outside the central southern area of Namibia  known as the  Police Zone  since the German era and which contained the main towns  industries  mines and best arable land   the country was divided into  homelands   the version of South African bantustan applied to Namibia  although only a few were actually established due to non cooperation by most indigenous Namibians  After many unsuccessful attempts by the UN to persuade South Africa to agree to the implementation of UN Resolution 435  which had been adopted by the UN Security Council in 1978 as the internationally agreed decolonisation plan for Namibia  transition to independence finally started in 1988 under the tripartite diplomatic agreement between South Africa  Angola and Cuba  with the USSR and the USA as observers  under which South Africa agreed to withdraw and demobilise its forces in Namibia and Cuba agreed to pull back its troops in southern Angola sent to support the MPLA in its war for control of Angola with UNITA  A combined UN civilian and peace keeping force under Finnish diplomat Martti Ahtisaari supervised the military withdrawals  return of SWAPO exiles and the holding of Namibia s first ever one person one vote election for a constituent assembly in October 1989  This was won by SWAPO although it did not gain the two thirds majority it had hoped for  the South African backed Democratic Turnhalle Alliance  DTA  became the official opposition  Following the adoption of the Namibian Constitution  including entrenched protection for human rights  compensation for state expropriations of private property  an independent judiciary and an executive presidency  the constituent assembly became the national assembly   the country officially became independent on 21 March 1990  Sam Nujoma was sworn in as the first President of Namibia watched by Nelson Mandela  who had been released from prison shortly beforehand  and representatives from 147 countries  including 20 heads of state  20 Walvis Bay was ceded to Namibia in 1994 upon the end of Apartheid in South Africa   edit  After independence Since independence Namibia has successfully completed the transition from white minority apartheid rule to parliamentary democracy  Multiparty democracy was introduced and has been maintained  with local  regional and national elections held regularly  Several registered political parties are active and represented in the National Assembly  although Swapo Party has won every election since independence  21  The transition from the 15 year rule of President Sam Nujoma to his successor  Hifikepunye Pohamba in 2005 went smoothly  22  Namibian government has promoted a policy of national reconciliation and issued an amnesty for those who had fought on either side during the liberation war  The civil war in Angola had a limited impact on Namibians living in the north of the country  In 1998  Namibia Defence Force  NDF  troops were sent to the Democratic Republic of the Congo as part of a Southern African Development Community  SADC  contingent  In August 1999  a secessionist attempt in the northeastern Caprivi region was successfully quashed  22   edit  Politics and government Tintenpalast  the center of Namibia s government Main article  Politics of Namibia The politics of Namibia takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic  whereby the president of Namibia is elected to a five year term and is both the head of state and the head of government  citation needed  The Constitution of Namibia guarantees the separation of powers  23  Executive power is exercised by the President and Cabinet  Legislature  Namibia has a bicameral Parliament with the National Assembly as lower house  and the National Council the upper house  Judiciary  Namibia has a system of courts that interpret and apply the law in the name of the state  While the constitution envisaged a multi party system for Namibia s government  The SWAPO party has been dominant since independence in 1990  citation needed   edit  Foreign relations Main article  Foreign relations of Namibia Namibia follows a largely independent foreign policy  with lingering affiliations with states that aided the independence struggle  including Libya and Cuba  With a small army and a fragile economy  the Namibian Government s principal foreign policy concern is developing strengthened ties within the Southern African region  A dynamic member of the Southern African Development Community  Namibia is a vocal advocate for greater regional integration  Namibia became the 160th member of the UN on 23 April 1990  On its independence it became the fiftieth member of the Commonwealth of Nations  citation needed   edit  Military Main article  Military of Namibia Namibia does not have any enemies in the region but consistently spends more on its military than all of its neighbours  except Angola  Military expenditure rose from 2 7  of GDP in 2000 to 3 7  in 2009  and the arrival of 12 Chengdu F 7 Airguard jets in 2006 and 2008 made Namibia for a short time one of the top arms importers in Sub Saharan Africa  24  The constitution of Namibia defined the role of the military as  defending the territory and national interests   Namibia formed the Namibian Defence Force  NDF   comprising former enemies in a 23 year bush war  the People s Liberation Army of Namibia  PLAN  and South West African Territorial Force  SWATF   The British formulated the plan for integrating these forces and began training the NDF  which consists of a small headquarters and five battalions  The United Nations Transitional Assistance Group  UNTAG  s Kenyan infantry battalion remained in Namibia for three months after independence to help train the NDF and to stabilize the north  According to the Namibian Defence Ministry  enlistments of both men and women will number no more than 7 500   edit  Geography and climate Sand dunes in the Namib Desert  Namibia Main article  Geography of Namibia At 825 418 km2  318 696 sq mi   25  Namibia is the world s thirty fourth largest country  after Venezuela   It lies mostly between latitudes 17  and 29 S  a small area is north of 17    and longitudes 11  and 26 E   edit  Administrative division Karas Caprivi Otjozondjupa Omusati Oshana Oshikoto Ohangwena Hardap Kunene Erongo Omaheke Khomas Okavango Main articles  Regions of Namibia and Constituencies of Namibia Namibia is divided into 13 regions and subdivided into 107 constituencies  The administrative division of Namibia is tabled by Delimitation Commissions and accepted or declined by the National Assembly  Since state foundation three Delimitation Commissions have been formed  the last one in 2002 under the chairmanship of Peter Shivute  26  Regional councillors are directly elected through secret ballots  regional elections  by the inhabitants of their constituencies  27   edit  Geographical areas The Namibian landscape consists generally of five geographical areas  each with characteristic abiotic conditions and vegetation with some variation within and overlap between them  the Central Plateau  the Namib Desert  the Great Escarpment  the Bushveld  and the Kalahari Desert   edit  Central Plateau Fish River Canyon Namib Desert Namib Escarpment The Kalahari Desert Windhoek skyline The Central Plateau runs from north to south  bordered by the Skeleton Coast to the northwest  the Namib Desert and its coastal plains to the southwest  the Orange River to the south  and the Kalahari Desert to the east  The Central Plateau is home to the highest point in Namibia at K nigstein elevation 2 606 meters  8 550 ft   28  Within the wide  flat Central Plateau is the majority of Namibia s population and economic activity  Windhoek  the nation s capital  is located here  as well as most of the arable land  Although arable land accounts for only 1  of Namibia  nearly half of the population is employed in agriculture  29  The abiotic conditions here are similar to those found along the Escarpment  however the topographic complexity is reduced  Summer temperatures in the area can reach 40  C  104  F   and frosts are common in the winter   edit  Namib Desert The Namib Desert is a broad expanse of hyper arid gravel plains and dunes that stretches along Namibia s entire coastline  It varies between 100 to many hundreds of kilometres in width  Areas within the Namib include the Skeleton Coast and the Kaokoveld in the north and the extensive Namib Sand Sea along the central coast  30  The sands that make up the sand sea result from processes of erosion that take place in the Orange River valley and areas further to the south  As sand laden waters drop their suspended loads into the Atlantic  onshore currents deposit them along the shore  The prevailing south west winds then pick up and redeposit the sand in the form of massive dunes in the widespread sand sea  forming the largest sand dunes in the world  In areas where the supply of sand is reduced because of the inability of the sand to cross riverbeds  the winds also scour the land to form large gravel plains  In many areas of the Namib Desert there is little vegetation aside from lichens found in the gravel plains and in dry river beds where plants can access subterranean water   edit  Great Escarpment The Great Escarpment swiftly rises to over 2 000 meters  6 562 ft   Average temperatures and temperature ranges increase further inland from the cold Atlantic waters  while the lingering coastal fogs slowly diminish  Although the area is rocky with poorly developed soils  it is nonetheless significantly more productive than the Namib Desert  As summer winds are forced over the Escarpment  moisture is extracted as precipitation  31  The water  along with rapidly changing topography  is responsible for the creation of microhabitats which offer a wide range of organisms  many of them endemic  Vegetation along the escarpment varies in both form and density  with community structure ranging from dense woodlands to more shrubby areas with scattered trees  A number of Acacia species are found here  as well as grasses and other shrubby vegetation   edit  Bushveld The Bushveld is found in north eastern Namibia along the Angolan border and in the Caprivi Strip which is the vestige of a narrow corridor demarcated for the German Empire to access the Zambezi River  The area receives a significantly greater amount of precipitation than the rest of the country  averaging around 400 mm  15 7 in  per year  Temperatures are also cooler and more moderate  with approximate seasonal variations of between 10 and 30  C  50 and 86  F   The area is generally flat and the soils sandy  limiting their ability to retain water  32  Located adjacent to the Bushveld in north central Namibia is one of nature s most spectacular features  the Etosha Pan  For most of the year it is a dry  saline wasteland  but during the wet season  it forms a shallow lake covering more than 6 000 square kilometres  2 317 sq mi   The area is ecologically important and vital to the huge numbers of birds and animals from the surrounding savannah that gather in the region as summer drought forces them to the scattered waterholes that ring the pan  The Bushveld area has been demarcated by the World Wildlife Fund as part of the Angolan Mopane woodlands ecoregion  which extends north across the Cunene River into neighbouring Angola   edit  Kalahari Desert The Kalahari Desert is perhaps Namibia s best known geographical feature  Shared with South Africa and Botswana  it has a variety of localized environments ranging from hyper arid sandy desert  to areas that seem to defy the common definition of desert  One of these areas  known as the Succulent Karoo  is home to over 5 000 species of plants  nearly half of them endemic  fully one third of the world s succulents are found in the Karoo  The reason behind this high productivity and endemism may be the relatively stable nature of precipitation  33  The Karoo apparently does not experience drought on a regular basis  so even though the area is technically desert  regular winter rains provide enough moisture to support the region s interesting plant community  Another feature of the Kalahari  indeed many parts of Namibia  are inselbergs  isolated mountains that create microclimates and habitat for organisms not adapted to life in the surrounding desert matrix   edit  Coastal Desert Namibia s Coastal Desert is one of the oldest deserts in the world  Its sand dunes  created by the strong onshore winds  are the highest in the world  34  The Namib Desert and the Namib Naukluft National Park are located here  The Namibian coastal deserts are one of the richest sources of diamonds on earth  The area is divided into the northern Skeleton Coast and the southern Diamond Coast  Because of the location of the shoreline  at the point where the Atlantic s cold water reach Africa  there is often extremely dense fog  35  Sandy beach composes 54  of the shoreline  and mixed sand and rock form another 28   Only 16  of the total length is rocky shoreline  The coastal plains are  dune fields   gravel plains covered with lichen and some scattered salt pans  Near the coast there are areas where the dunes are vegetated with hammocks  36  Namibia has rich coastal and marine resources that remain largely unexplored  37   edit  Weather and climate Namibia has more than 300 days of sunshine per year  It is situated at the southern edge of the tropics  the Tropic of Capricorn cuts the country about in half  The winter  June   August  is generally dry  both rainy seasons occur in summer  the small rainy season between September and November  the big one between February and April  38  Humidity is low  and average rainfall varies from almost zero in the coastal desert to more than 600 mm in the Caprivi Strip  Rainfall is however highly variable  and droughts are common  39  The last update  bad rainy season with rainfall far below the annual average occurred in summer 2006 07  40  Weather and climate in the coastal area are dominated by the cold  north flowing Benguela current of the Atlantic Ocean which accounts for very low precipitation  50 mm per year or less   frequent dense fog  and overall lower temperatures than in the rest of the country  39  In Winter  occasionally a condition known as Bergwind  German  Mountain breeze  or Oosweer  Afrikaans  East weather  occurs  a hot dry wind blowing from the inland to the coast  As the area behind the coast is a desert  these winds can develop into sand storms with sand deposits in the Atlantic Ocean visible on satellite images  41  The Central Plateau and Kalahari areas have wide diurnal temperature ranges of up to 30C  39  Efundja  the annual flooding of the northern parts of the country  often causes not only damage to infrastructure but loss of life  42  The rains that cause these floods originate in Angola  flow into Namibia s Cuvelai basin  and fill the Oshanas  Oshiwambo  flood plains  there  The worst floods so far update  occurred in March 2011 and displaced 21 000 people  43   edit  Economy Main article  Economy of Namibia The Namibian Stock Exchange in Windhoek Tsumeb s main road Namibia s economy is tied closely to South Africa s due to their shared history  44  45  The largest economic sectors are mining  10 4  of the gross domestic product in 2009   agriculture  5 0    manufacturing  13 5    and tourism  46  Namibia has a highly developed banking sector with modern infrastructure  such as Online Banking  Cellphone Banking  etc  The Bank of Namibia  BoN  is the central bank of Namibia responsible to perform all other functions ordinarily performed by a central bank  There are four BoN authorised commercial banks in Namibia  Bank Windhoek  First National Bank  Nedbank  amp  Standard Bank  47  Namibia has a high unemployment rate   Strict unemployment   people actively seeking a full time job  stood at 20 2  in 2000  21 9  in 2004 and spiraled to 29 4  in 2008  Under a broader definition  including people that have given up searching for employment  unemployment rose from 36 7  in 2004 to 51 2  in 2008  This estimate considers people in the informal economy as employed  Labour and Social Welfare Minister Immanuel Ngatjizeko praised the 2008 study as  by far superior in scope and quality to any that has been available previously   48  but its methodology has also received criticism  49  Approximately half the population live below the international poverty line of U S  1 25 a day  50  There are a number of legislative measures in place to alleviate poverty and unemployment  In 2004 a labour act was passed to protect people from job discrimination stemming from pregnancy and HIV AIDS status  In early 2010 the Government tender board announced that  henceforth 100 per cent of all unskilled and semi skilled labour must be sourced  without exception  from within Namibia   51   edit  Transportation Main article  Transport in Namibia The B2 between Swakopmund and Walvis Bay  Namibia  Despite the remote nature of much of the country  Namibia has seaports  airports  highways  and railways  narrow gauge   The country seeks to become a regional transportation hub  it has an important seaport and several landlocked neighbors  The Central Plateau already serves as a transportation corridor from the more densely populated north to South Africa  the source of four fifths of Namibia s imports  29   edit  Agriculture Main article  Agriculture in Namibia Welcoming sign of the Burgsdorf farm in Hardap  About half of the population depends on agriculture  largely subsistence agriculture  for its livelihood  but Namibia must still import some of its food  Although per capita GDP is five times the per capita GDP of Africa s poorest countries  the majority of Namibia s people live in rural areas and exist on a subsistence way of life  Namibia has one of the highest rates of income inequality in the world  due in part to the fact that there is an urban economy and a more rural cash less economy  The inequality figures thus take into account people who do not actually rely on the formal economy for their survival  About 4 000  mostly white  commercial farmers own almost half of Namibia s arable land  52  The governments of Germany and Britain will finance Namibia s land reform process  as Namibia plans to start expropriating land from white farmers to resettle landless black Namibians  53  Agreement has been reached on the privatisation of several more enterprises in coming years  with hopes that this will stimulate much needed foreign investment  However  reinvestment of environmentally derived capital has hobbled Namibian per capita income  54  One of the fastest growing areas of economic development in Namibia is the growth of wildlife conservancies  These conservancies are particularly important to the rural generally unemployed population   edit  Mining and electricity Main article  Mining in Namibia Providing 25  of Namibia s revenue  mining is the single most important contributor to the economy  55  Namibia is the fourth largest exporter of non fuel minerals in Africa and the world s fourth largest producer of uranium  There has been significant investment in uranium mining and Namibia is set to become the largest exporter of uranium by 2015  56  Rich alluvial diamond deposits make Namibia a primary source for gem quality diamonds  57  While Namibia is known predominantly for its gem diamond and uranium deposits  a number of other minerals are extracted industrially such as lead  tungsten  gold  tin  fluorspar  manganese  marble  copper and zinc  There are offshore gas deposits in the Atlantic Ocean that are planned to be extracted in the future  46  According to  The Diamond Investigation   a book about the global diamond market  from 1978  De Beers  the largest diamond company  bought most of the Namibian diamonds  and would continue to do so  because  whatever government eventually comes to power they will need this revenue to survive   58  Domestic supply voltage is 220V AC  Electricity is generated mainly by thermal and hydroelectric power plants  Non conventional methods of electricity generation also play some role  Encouraged by the rich uranium deposits the Namibian government plans to erect its first nuclear power station by 2018  also uranium enrichment is envisaged to happen locally  59   edit  Tourism An example of Namibian wildlife  the Plains Zebra  one focus of tourism Main article  Tourism in Namibia Tourism is a major contributor  14 5   to Namibia s GDP  creating tens of thousands of jobs  18 2  of all employment  directly or indirectly and servicing over a million tourists per annum  60  The country is among the prime destinations in Africa and is known for ecotourism which features Namibia s extensive wildlife  61  There are many lodges and reserves to accommodate eco tourists  Sport Hunting is also a large  and growing component of the Namibian economy  accounting for 14  of total tourism in the year 2000  or  19 6 million US dollars  with Namibia boasting numerous species sought after by international sport hunters  62  In addition  extreme sports such as sandboarding and 4x4ing have become popular  and many cities have companies that provide tours  The most visited places include the Caprivi Strip  Fish River Canyon  Sossusvlei  the Skeleton Coast Park  Sesriem  Etosha Pan and the coastal towns of Swakopmund  Walvis Bay and L deritz  citation needed   edit  Taxation and cost of living in Namibia Main article  Cost of living in Namibia Cost of living in Namibia is relatively high because most of the goods including cereals need to be imported  Business monopoly in some sectors causes higher profit bookings and further raising of prices  Its capital city  Windhoek is currently ranked as the 150th most expensive place in the world for expatriates to live  63  Personal income tax is applicable to total taxable income of an Individual and all individuals are taxed at progressive marginal rates over a series of income brackets  While the Value added tax  VAT  is applicable to most of the commodities and services  64   edit  Population  edit  Demographics A group of Herero women  Windhoek  Namibia Main article  Demographics of Namibia Namibia has the second lowest population density of any sovereign country  after Mongolia  65  The majority of the Namibian population is of Bantu speaking origin   mostly of the Ovambo ethnicity  which forms about half of the population   residing mainly in the north of the country  although many are now resident in towns throughout Namibia  Other ethnic groups are the Herero and Himba people  who speak a similar language  and the Damara  who speak the same  click  language as the Nama  In addition to the Bantu majority  there are large groups of Khoisan  such as Nama and Bushmen   who are descendants of the original inhabitants of Southern Africa  The country also contains some descendants of refugees from Angola  There are also two smaller groups of people with mixed racial origins  called  Coloureds  and  Basters   who together make up 6 5   with the Coloureds outnumbering the Basters two to one   There is a large Chinese minority in Namibia  66  Whites of Portuguese  Dutch  German  British and French ancestry make up about 7  of the population  they form the second largest population of European ancestry  both in terms of percentage and actual numbers  in Sub Saharan Africa after South Africa  1  Most Namibian whites and nearly all those of mixed race speak Afrikaans and share similar origins  culture  and religion as the white and coloured populations of South Africa  A smaller proportion of whites  around 30 000  trace their family origins directly back to German colonial settlers and maintain German cultural and educational

Methodist Episcopal  and Dutch Reformed Christians  Additionally  Mormons  Latter Day Saints  are represented  as well as some Jewish people  72   edit  Language Main article  Languages of Namibia Although its official language is English  Namibia is a multilingual country as it is illustrated on these examples in English  German  Afrikaans and Oshiwambo  The official language is English  Until 1990  German and Afrikaans were also official languages  Long before Namibia s independence from South Africa  SWAPO had decided that the country should become officially monolingual  consciously choosing this approach in contrast to that of its neighbour  which was regarded as  a deliberate policy of ethnolinguistic fragmentation   73  Consequently  English became the sole official language of Namibia  Some other languages have received semi official recognition by being allowed as medium of instruction in primary schools  The northern majority of Namibians speak Oshiwambo as their first language  whereas the most widely understood and spoken language is Afrikaans  Among the younger generation  the most widely understood languages are English and Afrikaans  Both Afrikaans and English are used primarily as a second language reserved for public communication  but small first language groups exist throughout the country  While the official language is English  most of the white population speaks either German or Afrikaans  Even today  90 years after the end of the German colonial era  the German language plays a leading role as a commercial language  Afrikaans is spoken by 60  of the white community  German is spoken by 32   English is spoken by 7  and Portuguese by 1   1  Geographical proximity to Portuguese speaking Angola explains the relatively high number of

epidemic is a large problem in Namibia  Though its rate of infection is substantially lower than that of its eastern neighbor  Botswana  approximately 15  of the adult population is update  infected with HIV  75  In 2001  there were an estimated 210 000 people living with HIV AIDS  and the estimated death toll in 2003 was 16 000  According to the 2011 UNAIDS Report  the epidemic in Namibia  appears to be leveling off   76  As the HIV AIDS epidemic has reduced the working aged population  the number of orphans has increased  It falls to the government to provide education  food  shelter and clothing for these orphans  77  The malaria problem seems to be compounded by the AIDS epidemic  Research has shown that in Namibia the risk of contracting malaria is 14 5  greater if a person is also infected with HIV  The risk of death from malaria is also raised by approximately 50  with a concurrent HIV infection  78  Given infection rates this large  as well as a looming malaria problem  it may be very difficult for the government to deal with both the medical and economic impacts of this epidemic  The country had only 598 physicians in 2002  79   edit  Culture  edit  Education
