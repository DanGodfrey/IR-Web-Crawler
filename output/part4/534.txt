Roaring Twenties From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search The Roaring Twenties characterizes the distinctive cultural edge of the 1920s  principally in American cities  but also in London  Berlin and Paris for a period of sustained economic prosperity  The phrase emphasizes the period s social  artistic  and cultural dynamism   Normalcy  returned to politics in the wake of World War I  jazz music blossomed  the flapper redefined modern womanhood  Art Deco peaked  and finally the Wall Street Crash of 1929 ended the era  as the Great Depression set in worldwide  Economically the era saw the large scale diffusion and use of automobiles  telephones  motion pictures  and electricity  unprecedented industrial growth  accelerated consumer demand and aspirations  and significant changes in lifestyle and culture  The media focused on celebrities  especially sports heroes and movie stars  as cities rooted for their home team and filled the new palatial movie theaters and gigantic stadiums  In most major countries women were voting for the first time  The social and cultural features known as the Roaring Twenties began in leading metropolitan centers  especially Chicago  New Orleans  New York  Philadelphia  Paris and London  then spread widely in the aftermath of World War I  The United States gained dominance in world finance  Thus when Germany could no longer afford war reparations to Britain  France and other Allies  the Americans came up with the Dawes Plan and Wall Street invested heavily in Germany  which repaid its reparations to nations that in turn used the dollars to pay off their war debts to Washington  By the middle of the decade  prosperity was widespread  The second half of the decade becoming known as the  Golden Twenties   In France and francophone Canada  they were also called the  ann es folles    Crazy Years    1  The spirit of the Roaring Twenties was marked by a general feeling of discontinuity associated with modernity a break with traditions  Everything seemed to be feasible through modern technology  New technologies  especially automobiles  moving pictures and radio proliferated  modernity  to a large part of the population  Formal decorative frills were shed in favor of practicality in both daily life and architecture  At the same time  jazz and dancing rose in popularity  in opposition to the mood of the specter of World War I  As such  the period is also often referred to as the Jazz Age  Contents 1 Economy 1 1 Demobilization 1 2 Economic policies 1 3 New products and

 and the rapid growth of consumer goods such as automobiles  The North American economy  particularly the economy of the US  which had successfully transitioned from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy  boomed  although there were sectors that were stagnant  especially farming and mining  The United States augmented its standing as the richest country in the world  its industry aligned to mass production and its society acculturated into consumerism  In Europe  the economy did not start to flourish until 1924  2  The Roaring Twenties ended with the Stock Market Crash of late 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression  Chart 1  GDP annual pattern and long term trend  1920 40  in billions of constant dollars 3   edit  Demobilization At the end of World War I  soldiers returned to the United States and Canada with wartime wages and many new products on the market on which to spend  At first  the recession of wartime production caused a brief but deep recession  known as the post World War I recession  Quickly  however  the U S  and Canadian economies rebounded as returning soldiers re entered the labor force and factories were retooled to produce consumer goods   edit  Economic policies The 1920s was a decade of increased consumer spending and economic growth fed by supply side economic policy  4  The post war saw three consecutive Republican administrations in the U S  All three took the conservative position of forging a close relationship between those in government and big business  When President Warren Harding took office in 1921  the national economy was in the depths of a depression with an unemployment rate of 20  and runaway inflation  Harding signed the Emergency Tariff of 1921 and the Fordney McCumber Tariff of 1922  Harding proposed to reduce the national debt  reduce taxes  protect farming interests  and cut back on immigration  Harding did not live to see it  but most of his agenda was passed by the Congress  These policies led to the  boom  of the Coolidge years  5  One of the main initiatives of both the Harding and Coolidge administrations was the rolling back of income taxes on the wealthy which had been raised during World War I  It was believed that a heavy tax burden on the rich would slow the economy  and actually reduce tax revenues  This tax cut was achieved under President Calvin Coolidge s administration  Furthermore  Coolidge consistently blocked any attempts at government intrusion into private business  Harding and Coolidge s managerial approach sustained economic growth throughout most of the decade  However  the overconfidence of these years contributed to the speculative bubble that sparked the stock market crash and the Great Depression  6  7  The government s role as an arbiter rather than an active entity continued under President Herbert Hoover  Hoover worked to get businessmen to respond to the crisis by calling them into conferences and urging them to cooperate  Hoover s vigorous attempts to get business to end the depression failed  When the income tax was established in 1913  the highest marginal tax rate was 7 percent  it was increased to 77 percent in 1916 to help finance World War I  The top rate was reduced to as low as 25 percent in 1925  The  normalcy  of the 1920s incorporated considerably higher levels of federal spending and taxes than the Progressive era before World War I  From 1929 to 1933  under President Hoover s administration  real per capita federal expenditures increased by 88 percent  8  In 1920 1921 there was an acute recession  followed by the sustained recovery throughout the 1920s  The Federal Reserve expanded credit  by setting below market interest rates and low reserve requirements that favored big banks  and the money supply actually increased by about 60  during the time following the recession  By the latter part of the decade  buying on margin  entered the American vocabulary as more and more Americans over extended themselves to speculate on the soaring stock market and expanding credit  Very few expected the crash that began in 1929  and none suspected it would be so drastic or so prolonged   edit  New products and technologies Mass production made technology affordable to the middle class  9  The automobile  movie  radio  and chemical industries skyrocketed during the 1920s  Of chief importance was the automobile industry  Before the war  cars were a luxury  In the 1920s  mass produced vehicles became common throughout the U S  and Canada  By 1927  Ford discontinued the Model T after selling 15 million of that model  Only about 300 000 vehicles were registered in 1918 in all of Canada  but by 1929  there were 1 9 million  and automobile parts were being made in parts of Ontario near Detroit  Michigan  The automobile industry s effects were widespread  contributing to such industries as highway building  motels  service stations  used car dealerships and new housing outside the range of mass transit  Radio became the first mass broadcasting medium  Radios were expensive  but their mode of entertainment proved revolutionary  Radio advertising became the grandstand for mass marketing  Its economic importance led to the mass culture that has dominated society since  During the  golden age of radio   radio programming was as varied as TV programming today  The 1927 establishment of the Federal Radio Commission introduced a new era of regulation  In 1925  electrical recording  one of the greatest advances in sound recording became available for commercially issued phonograph records  Hollywood boomed  producing a new form of entertainment that shut down the old vaudeville  Watching a movie was cheap and accessible  crowds surged into new downtown movie palaces and neighborhood theatres  with even greater marvels like sound appearing at the end of the decade  Sound synchronized motion pictures  or  talkies   were quickly replacing silent films between 1927 and 1929  details below   In 1927 Charles  Lucky Lindy  Lindbergh arose to instant fame with the first solo non stop transatlantic flight  details below   and advances in aviation were to lead to commercial aviation in the next decade  Developments in television and Alexander Fleming s study of penicillin were laying the groundwork for commercial use of these important products in the 1940s   edit  New infrastructure The new technologies led to an unprecedented need for new infrastructure  largely funded by the government  Road construction was crucial to the motor vehicle industry  several roads were upgraded to highways  and expressways were constructed  A class of Americans emerged with surplus money and a desire to spend more  spurring the demand for consumer goods  including the automobile  Electrification  having slowed during the war  progressed greatly as more of the U S  and Canada was added to the electric grid  Most industries switched from coal power to electricity  At the same time  new power plants were constructed  In America  electricity production almost quadrupled citation needed   Telephone lines also were being strung across the continent  Indoor plumbing and modern sewer systems were installed for the first time in many regions  These infrastructure programs were mostly left to the local governments in both Canada and the United States  Most local governments went deeply into debt under the assumption that an investment in such infrastructure would pay off in the future  which later caused major problems during the Great Depression  citation needed  In both Canada and the United States  the federal governments did the reverse  using the decade to pay down war debts and roll back some of the taxes that had been introduced during the war citation needed    edit  Urbanization Urbanization reached a climax in the 1920s  For the first time  more Americans and Canadians lived in cities of 2 500 or more people than in small towns or rural areas  However the nation was fascinated with its great metropolitan centers that contained about 15  of the population  New York and Chicago vied in building skyscrapers  and New York pulled ahead with the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Buildings  The finance and insurance industries doubled and tripled in size  The basic pattern of the modern white collar job was set during the late 19th century  but it now became the norm for life in large and medium cities  Typewriters  filing cabinets and telephones brought unmarried women into clerical jobs  In Canada  one in five workers was a woman by the end of the decade  The fastest growing cities were those in the Midwest and the Great Lakes region  including Chicago and Toronto  dubious   discuss  These cities prospered because of their vast agricultural hinterlands  Cities on the West Coast received increasing benefits from the 1914 opening of the Panama Canal   edit  Culture  edit  Suffrage Main article  Women s suffrage On August 18  1920  Tennessee became the last of 36 states needed to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment  granting women the right to vote  Equality at the polls marked a pivotal moment in the women s rights movement   edit  Lost Generation Main article  Lost Generation The Lost Generation were young people who came out of World War I disillusioned and cynical about the world  The term usually refers to American literary notables who lived in Paris at the time  Famous members included Ernest Hemingway  F  Scott Fitzgerald  and Gertrude Stein  These authors  also referred to as expatriates  wrote novels and short stories expressing their resentment towards the materialism and individualism that permeated during this era   edit  Social criticism Main article  Social issues of the 1920s As the average American in the 1920s became more enamored of wealth and everyday luxuries  some began satirizing the hypocrisy and greed they observed  Of these social critics  Sinclair Lewis was the most popular  His popular 1920 novel Main Street satirized the dull and ignorant lives of the residents of a Midwestern town  He followed with Babbitt  about a middle aged businessman who rebels against his safe life and family  only to realize that the young generation is as hypocritical as his own  Lewis satirized religion with Elmer Gantry  which followed a con man who teams up with an evangelist to sell religion to a small town  Other social critics included Sherwood Anderson  Edith Wharton and H L  Mencken  Anderson published a collection of short stories titled Winesburg  Ohio  which studied the dynamics of a small town  Wharton mocked the fads of the new era through her novels  such as Twilight Sleep  1927   Mencken criticized narrow American tastes and culture in various essays and articles   edit  Art Deco Climax of the new architectural style  the Chrysler Building in New York City was built after the European wave of Art Deco reached the United States  Art Deco was the style of design and architecture that marked the era  Originating in Europe  it spread to the rest of western Europe and North America towards the mid 1920s  In the U S   one of the most remarkable buildings featuring this style was constructed as the tallest building of the time  the Chrysler Building  The forms of art deco were pure and geometric  even though the artists often drew inspiration from nature  In the beginning  lines were curved  though rectilinear designs would later become more and more popular   edit  Expressionism and Surrealism Further information  Weimar culture Painting in North America during the 1920s developed in a different direction than that of Europe  In Europe  the 1920s were the era of expressionism  and later surrealism  As Man Ray stated in 1920 after the publication of a unique issue of New York Dada   Dada cannot live in New York    edit  Cinema Felix the Cat  a popular cartoon character of the decade  exhibits his famous pace  At the beginning of the decade  films were silent and colorless  In 1922  the first all color feature  The Toll of the Sea  was released  In 1926  Warner Bros  released Don Juan  the first feature with sound effects and music  In 1927  Warner released The Jazz Singer  the first sound feature to include limited talking sequences  The public went wild for talkies  and movie studios converted to sound almost overnight  10  In 1928  Warner released Lights of New York  the first all talking feature film  In the same year  the first sound cartoon  Dinner Time  was released  Warner ended the decade by unveiling  in 1929  the first all color  all talking feature film  On with the Show  Cartoon Shorts were popular in movie theaters during this time  The late 1920s saw the emergence of Walt Disney  Mickey Mouse made his debut in  Steamboat Willie  on November 18  1928 at the Colony Theater in New York City  Mickey would go on to star in more than 120 cartoon shorts  not to mention starring in the Mickey Mouse Club  and other specials  This would jump start Disney and would lead to creation of other characters going into the 1930s  11 Oswald  a character created by Disney  before Mickey  in 1927  who was contracted by Universal for distribution purposes  starred in a series of shorts between 1927 and 1928  Disney lost the rights to the character  but in 2006  regained the rights to Oswald  He was the first Disney character to be merchandised  12  The period saw the emergence of box office draws such as Mae Murray  Ram n Novarro  Rudolph Valentino  Charlie Chaplin  Buster Keaton  Harold Lloyd  Warner Baxter  Clara Bow  Louise Brooks  Bebe Daniels  Billie Dove  Dorothy Mackaill  Mary Astor  Nancy Carroll  Janet Gaynor  Charles Farrell  William Haines  Conrad Nagel  John Gilbert  Greta Garbo  Dolores del R o  Norma Talmadge  Colleen Moore  Nita Naldi  John Barrymore  Norma Shearer  Joan Crawford  Mary Pickford  Douglas Fairbanks  Anna May Wong  and Al Jolson citation needed    edit  Harlem Renaissance African American literary and artistic culture developed rapidly during the 1920s under the banner of  The Harlem Renaissance   In 1921  the Black Swan Corporation opened  At its height  it issued ten recordings per month  All African American musicals also started in 1921  In 1923  the Harlem Renaissance Basketball Club was founded by Bob Douglas  During the later 1920s  and especially in the 1930s  the basketball team became known as the best in the world  The first issue of Opportunity was published  The African American playwright  Willis Richardson  debuted his play The Chip Woman s Fortune  at the Frazee Theatre  also known as the Wallacks theatre   1  Notable African American authors such as Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston began to achieve a level of national public recognition during the 1920s  African American culture has contributed the largest part to the rise of jazz   edit  Dance Dance clubs became enormously popular in the 1920s  Their popularity peaked in the late 1920s and reached into the early 1930s  Dance music came to dominate all forms of popular music by the late 1920s  Classical pieces  operettas  folk music  etc  were all transformed into popular dance melodies in order to satiate the public craze for dancing much as the disco phenomena would later do in the late 1970s  For example  many of the songs from the 1929 Technicolor musical operetta The Rogue Song  starring the Metropolitan Opera star Lawrence Tibbett  were rearranged and released as dance music and became popular club hits in 1929  Dance clubs across the U S  sponsored dance contests  where dancers invented  tried  and competed with new moves  Professionals began to hone their skills in tap dance and other dances of the era throughout the stage circuit across the United States  With the advent of talking pictures  sound film  musicals became all the rage and film studios flooded the box office with extravagant and lavish musical films  many of which were filmed in early Technicolor  One of the most popular of these musicals  Gold Diggers of Broadway  became the highest grossing film of the decade  Harlem played a key role in the development of dance styles  With several entertainment venues  people from all walks of life  all races  and all classes came together  The Cotton Club featured black performers and catered to a white clientele  while the Savoy Ballroom catered to a mostly black clientele  The most popular dances throughout the decade were the foxtrot  waltz and American tango  From the early 1920s  however  a variety of eccentric novelty dances were developed  The first of these were the Breakaway and Charleston  Both were based on African American musical styles and beats  including the widely popular blues  The Charleston s popularity exploded after its feature in two 1922 Broadway shows  A brief Black Bottom craze  originating from the Apollo Theater  swept dance halls from 1926 to 1927  replacing the Charleston in popularity  By 1927  the Lindy Hop  a dance based on Breakaway and Charleston and integrating elements of tap  became the dominant social dance  Developed in the Savoy Ballroom  it was set to stride piano ragtime jazz  The Lindy Hop would later evolve into Swing dance  These dances  nonetheless  were never mainstreamed  and the overwhelming majority of people continued to dance the foxtrot  waltz and tango throughout the decade  The dance craze had a large influence on music  Large numbers of recordings labeled as foxtrot  tango and waltz were produced and gave rise to a generation of performers that became famous as recording artists or radio artists  Top vocalists included Nick Lucas  Scrappy Lambert  Frank Munn  Lewis James  Chester Gaylord  Gene Austin  James Melton  Franklyn Baur  Johnny Marvin  Vaughn De Leath  and Ruth Etting  Leading dance orchestra leaders included Bob Haring  Harry Horlick  Louis Katzman  Leo Reisman  Victor Arden  Phil Ohman  George Olsen  Ted Lewis  Abe Lyman  Ben Selvin  Nat Shilkret  Fred Waring  and Paul Whiteman   edit  Fashion Main article  Flapper Immortalized in movies and magazine covers  young women s fashion of the 1920s was both a trend and a social statement  a breaking off from the rigid Victorian way of life  These young  rebellious  middle class women  labeled  flappers  by older generations  did away with the corset and donned slinky knee length dresses  which exposed their legs and arms  The hairstyle of the decade was a chin length bob  of which there were several popular variations  Cosmetics  which until the 1920s was not typically accepted in American society because of its association with prostitution  became  for the first time  extremely popular  13   edit  The changing role of women With the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920 that gave women the right to vote  women finally attained the political equality that they had so long been fighting for  A generational gap began to form between the  new  women of the 1920s and the previous generation  Prior to the 19th Amendment  feminists commonly thought that women could not pursue both a career and a family successfully  believing that one would inherently inhibit the development of the other  This mentality began to change in the 1920s as more women began to desire not only successful careers of their own but also families  14  The  new  woman was less invested in social service than the Progressive generations  and in tune with the capitalistic spirit of the era  she was eager to compete and to find personal fulfilment  15  The 1920s saw significant change in the lives of working women  World War I had temporarily allowed women to enter into industries such as chemical  automobile  and iron and steel manufacturing  which were once deemed inappropriate work for women  16  Black women  who had been historically closed out of factory jobs  began to find a place in industry during World War I by accepting lower wages and replacing the lost immigrant labor and in heavy work  Yet  like other women during World War I  their success was only temporary  most black women were also pushed out of their factory jobs after the war  In 1920  seventy five percent of the black female labor force consisted of agricultural laborers  domestic servants  and laundry workers  17  Legislation passed at the beginning of the 20th century mandated a minimum wage and forced many factories to shorten their workdays  This shifted the focus in the 1920s to job performance in order to meet demand  Factories encouraged workers to produce more quickly and efficiently with speedups and bonus systems  increasing the pressure on factory workers  17  Despite the strain on women in the factories  the booming economy of the 1920s meant more opportunities even for the lower classes  Many young girls from working class backgrounds did not need to help support their families as prior generations did and were often encouraged to seek work or receive vocational training which would result in social mobility  18  The achievement of suffrage led to feminists refocusing their efforts towards other goals  Groups such as the National Women s Party  NWP  continued the political fight  proposing the Equal Rights Amendment in 1923 and working to remove laws that used sex to discriminate against women  19  But many women shifted their focus from politics to challenge traditional definitions of womanhood  Young women  especially  began staking claim to their own bodies and took part in a sexual liberation of their generation  Many of the ideas that fueled this change in sexual thought were already floating around New York intellectual circles prior to World War I  with the writings of Sigmund Freud  Havelock Ellis  and Ellen Key  There  thinkers outed that sex was not only central to the human experience but that women were sexual beings with human impulses and desires just like men and restraining these impulses was self destructive  By the 1920s  these ideas had permeated the mainstream  20  The 1920s saw the emergence of the co ed  as women began attending large state colleges and universities  Women entered into the mainstream middle class experience  but took on a gendered role within society  Women typically took classes such as home economics   Husband and Wife    Motherhood  and  The Family as an Economic Unit   In an increasingly conservative post war era  it was common for a young woman to attend college with the intention of finding a suitable husband  21  Fueled by ideas of sexual liberation  dating underwent major changes on college campuses  With the advent of the automobile  courtship occurred in a much more private setting   Petting   sexual relations without intercourse  became the social norm for college students  22  Despite women s increased knowledge of pleasure and sex  the decade of unfettered capitalism that was the 1920s gave birth to the  feminine mystique   With this formulation  all women wanted to marry  all good women stayed at home with their children  cooking and cleaning  and the best women did the aforementioned and in addition  exercised their purchasing power freely and as frequently as possible in order to better their families and their homes  23  This left many housewives feeling frustrated and unsatisfied   edit  Tolerance towards other groups Sheet music poking fun at the masculine traits many women adopted during the 1920s  In urban areas  minorities were treated with more equality than they had been accustomed to previously  citation needed  This was reflected in some of the films of the decade  Redskin  1929  and Son of the Gods  1929   for instance  deal sympathetically with Native Americans and Asian Americans respectively  openly reviling social bias  On the stage and in movies  black and white players appeared together for the first time  24  It became possible to go to nightclubs and see whites and minorities dancing and eating together  Even popular songs poked fun at the new social acceptance of homosexuality  One of these songs had the title  Masculine Women  Feminine Men   25  It was released in 1926 and recorded by numerous artists of the day and included the following lyrics  26  Masculine women  Feminine men Which is the rooster  which is the hen  It s hard to tell  em apart today  And  say  Sister is busy learning to shave  Brother just loves his permanent wave  It s hard to tell  em apart today  Hey  hey  Girls were girls and boys were boys when I was a tot  Now we don t know who is who  or even what s what  Knickers and trousers  baggy and wide  Nobody knows who s walking inside  Those masculine women and feminine men  27  The relative liberalism of the decade is demonstrated by the fact that the actor William Haines  regularly named in newspapers and magazines as the  1 male box office draw  openly lived in a gay relationship with his partner  Jimmie Shields  28  Other popular gay actors actresses of the decade included Alla Nazimova and Ram n Novarro  29  In 1927  Mae West wrote a play about homosexuality called  The Drag   30  31  and alluded to the work of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs  It was a box office success  West regarded talking about sex as a basic human rights issue  and was also an early advocate of gay rights  With the return of conservatism in the 1930s  the public grew intolerant of homosexuality  and gay actors were forced to choose between retiring or agreeing to hide their sexuality  citation needed   edit  Society  edit  Immigration laws The United States  and to a lesser degree Canada  became more xenophobic or  at least  anti immigrant  The American Immigration Act of 1924 limited immigration from countries where 2  of the total U S  population  per the 1890 census  not counting African Americans   were immigrants from that country  Thus  the massive influx of Europeans that had come to America during the first two decades of the century slowed to a trickle  Asians and citizens of India were prohibited from immigrating altogether  Alien Land Laws  such as California s Webb Haney Act in 1913  prevented aliens ineligible for citizenship   except Filipinos  who were subjects of U S   of the right to own land in California  It also limited the leasing of land by said aliens to three years  Many Japanese immigrants  or Issei  circumvented this law by transferring the title of their land to their American born children  or Nisei  who were citizens  Similar laws were passed in 11 other states  In Canada  the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923 prevented almost all immigration from Asia  Other laws curbed immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe  A Gentlemen s Act gave America the right to prevent any Japanese immigrants from entering the country   edit  Popular music The 1920s also saw the rise in popularity of various new styles of recorded music  Jazz became the most popular form of music for young people and the flapper culture  Famous jazz performers and singers from the 1920s include Louis Armstrong  Duke Ellington  Sidney Bechet  Jelly Roll Morton  Joe  King  Oliver  James P  Johnson  Fletcher Henderson  Frankie Trumbauer  Paul Whiteman  Bix Beiderbecke  and Bing Crosby  The development of urban and city blues also began in the 1920s with performers such as Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey  In the later part of the decade  early forms of country music were pioneered by Jimmie Rodgers  The Carter Family  Uncle Dave Macon  Vernon Dalhart  Charlie Poole  and others   edit  Prohibition Main article  Prohibition in the United States In 1920  the manufacture  sale  import and export of alcohol was prohibited by the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in an attempt to alleviate various social problems  this came to be known as  Prohibition   It was enacted through the Volstead Act  supported greatly by churches and leagues such as  The Anti Saloon League   America s continued desire for alcohol under prohibition led to the rise of organized crime as typified by Chicago s Al Capone  smuggling and gangster associations all over the U S  In Canada  prohibition was only imposed nationally for a short period of time  but the American liquor laws nonetheless had an important impact   edit  Rise of the speakeasy  Save A Little Dram For Me  Prohibition era song recorded by Thomas Edison studio  1922  Duration 3 29  Problems listening to this file  See media help  Speakeasies became popular and numerous as the Prohibition years progressed and led to the rise of gangsters such as Lucky Luciano  Al Capone  Moe Dalitz  Joseph Ardizzone  and Sam Maceo  They commonly operated with connections to organized crime and liquor smuggling  While the U S  Federal Government agents raided such establishments and arrested many of the small figures and smugglers  they rarely managed to get the big bosses  the business of running speakeasies was so lucrative that such establishments continued to flourish throughout the nation  In major cities  speakeasies could often be elaborate  offering food  live bands  and floor shows  Police were notoriously bribed by speakeasy operators to either leave them alone or at least give them advance notice of any planned raid   edit  Literature Further information  1920s Literature The Roaring Twenties was a period of literary creativity  and works of several notable authors appeared during the period  D  H  Lawrence s novel Lady Chatterley s Lover was a scandal at the time because of its explicit descriptions of sex  Books that take the 1920s as their subject include  The Great Gatsby by F  Scott Fitzgerald is often described as the epitome of the  Jazz Age  in American literature  All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque recounts the horrors of World War I and also the deep detachment from German civilian life felt by many men returning from the front  This Side of Paradise by F  Scott Fitzgerald portrays the lives and morality of post World War I youth  The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway is about a group of expatriate Americans in Europe during the 1920s   edit  Solo flight across the Atlantic Charles Lindbergh gained sudden great international fame as the first pilot to fly solo and non stop across the Atlantic Ocean  flying from Roosevelt Airfield  Nassau County  Long Island   New York to Paris on May 20 May 21  1927  He had a single engine airplane   The Spirit of St  Louis   which had been designed by Donald Hall and custom built by Ryan Airlines of San Diego  California  His flight took 33 5 hours  The President of France bestowed on him the French Legion of Honor and  on his arrival back in the United States  a fleet of warships and aircraft escorted him to Washington  D C   where President Calvin Coolidge awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross   edit  Sports The Roaring Twenties was the breakout decade for sports across the modern world  Citizens from all parts of the country flocked to see the top athletes of the day compete in arenas and stadiums  Their exploits were loudly and highly praised in the new  gee whiz  style of sports journalism that was emerging  champions of this style of writing included the legendary writers Grantland Rice and Damon Runyon in the U S  Sports literature presented a new form of heroism departing from the traditional models of masculinity  32  High school and junior high schools were offered to play sports that they hadn t been able to play in the past  Several sports  such as golf  that had previously been unavailable to the middle class finally became available  Also  a notable motor sports feat was accomplished in Roaring Twenties as driver Henry Seagrave  driving his car the Golden Arrow  reaches at the time in 1929 a record speed of 231 44 mph   edit  Argentina Football  soccer  was an important aspect of mass culture in Buenos Aires during the 1920s  serving as a focus of national identity and pride  Sportswriters wrote in terms of the values and achievements of the popular classes  In their discourse nationalist rhetoric was combined with a more traditional emphasis on sportsmanship  33   edit  Olympics Following the 1922 Latin American Games in Rio de Janeiro  IOC officials toured the region  helping countries establish national Olympic committees and prepare for future competition  In some countries  such as Brazil  sporting and political rivalries hindered progress as opposing factions battled for control of international sport  The 1924 Olympic Games in Paris and the 1928 games in Amsterdam saw greatly increased participation from Latin American athletes  34  Sports journalism  modernity  and nationalism excited Egypt  Egyptians of all classes were captivated by news of the Egyptian national soccer team s performance in international competitions  Success or failure in the Olympics of 1924 and 1928 was more than a betting opportunity but became an index of Egyptian independence and a desire to be seen as modern by Europe  Egyptians also saw these competitions as a way to distinguish themselves from the traditionalism of the rest of Africa  35   edit  Balkans The Greek government of Eleftherios Venizelos initiated a number of programs involving physical education in the public schools and raised the profile of sports competition  Other Balkan nations also became more involved in sports and participated in several precursors of the Balkan Games  competing sometimes with Western European teams  The Balkan Games  first held in Athens in 1929 as an experiment  proved a sporting and a diplomatic success  From the beginning  the games  held in Greece through 1933  sought to improve relations among Greece  Turkey  Bulgaria  Yugoslavia  Romania  and Albania  As a political and diplomatic event  the games worked in conjunction with an annual Balkan Conference  which resolved issues between these often feuding nations  The results were quite successful  officials from all countries routinely praised the games  athletes and organizers  During a period of persistent and systematic efforts to create rapprochement and unity in the region  this series of athletic meetings played a key role  36   edit  United States The most popular American athlete of the 1920s was baseball player Babe Ruth  His characteristic home run hitting heralded a new epoch in the history of the sport  the  Live ball era    and his high style of living fascinated the nation and made him one of the highest profile figures of the decade  Fans were enthralled in 1927 when Ruth hit 60 home runs  setting a new single season home run record that was not broken until 1961  Together with another up and coming star named Lou Gehrig  Ruth laid the foundation of future New York Yankees dynasties  A former bar room brawler named Jack Dempsey won the world heavyweight boxing title and became the most celebrated pugilist of his time  College football captivated fans  with notables such as Red Grange  running back of the University of Illinois  and Knute Rockne who coached Notre Dame s football program to great success on the field and nation wide notoriety  Grange also played a role in the development of professional football in the mid 1920s by signing on with the NFL s Chicago Bears  Bill Tilden thoroughly dominated his competition in tennis  cementing his reputation as one of the greatest tennis players of all time  And Bobby Jones popularized golf with his spectacular successes on the links  the game did not see another major star of his stature come along until Jack Nicklaus  Ruth  Dempsey  Grange  Tilden  and Jones are collectively referred to as the  Big Five  sporting icons of the Roaring Twenties   edit  American politics  edit  Warren G  Harding Warren G  Harding ran on a promise to  Return to Normalcy   a term he coined  which reflected three trends of his time  a renewed isolationism in reaction to World War I  a resurgence of nativism  and turning away from the government activism of the reform era  Throughout his administration  Harding adopted laissez faire policies  Harding s  Front Porch Campaign  during the late summer and fall of 1920 captured the imagination of the country  It was the first campaign to be heavily covered by the press and to receive widespread newsreel coverage  and it was also the first modern campaign to use the power of Hollywood and Broadway stars who traveled to Marion for photo opportunities with Harding and his wife  Al Jolson  Lillian Russell  Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford  were among the luminaries to make the pilgrimage to central Ohio  Business icons Thomas Edison  Henry Ford and Harvey Firestone also lent their cachet to the Front Porch Campaign  From the onset of the campaign until the November election  over 600 000 people traveled to Marion to participate  One of the most significant accomplishments of the Harding Administration was the Washington Naval Conference that set limits to military build up around the world  His administration was plagued with scandals with which he was likely not involved  see Teapot Dome   On the scandals  he commented   My God  this is a hell of a job   and   I have no trouble with my enemies  but my damn friends  they re the ones that keep me walking the floors at night   Harding s presidency was cut short by a sudden heart attack which some historians believe was caused by the stress of his scandals  See also  United States presidential election  1920  edit  Calvin Coolidge Calvin Coolidge was inaugurated as president after the death of President Harding  He was easily elected in 1924 when he ran on a basis of order and prosperity  Coolidge made use of the new medium of radio and made radio history several times while president  his inauguration was the first presidential inauguration broadcast on radio  on 12 February 1924  he became the first President of the United States to deliver a political speech on radio  and only ten days thereafter  on 22 February  he also became the first to deliver such a speech from the White House  He is famous for his quotation  The chief business of the American people is business   Coolidge continued Harding s laissez faire politics  In foreign policy  he preferred isolationism but did sign the Kellog Briand Pact as a way to prevent future wars   edit  Herbert Hoover Herbert Hoover was the final president of the 1920s  taking office in 1929  He stated in 1928   We in America today are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the history of any land   Hoover signed the controversial Smoot Hawley Tariff into law and was forced to deal with the consequences of the Wall Street Crash of 1929  edit  Decline of labor unions Main article  Trade union Unions grew very rapidly during the war but after a series of failed major strikes in steel  meatpacking and other industries  a long decade of decline weakened most unions and membership fell even as employment grew rapidly  Radical unionism virtually collapsed  in large part because of Federal repression during World War I by means of the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918  The major unions supported the third party candidacy of Robert La Follette in 1924   edit  Progressivism in 1920s Main article  Progressive Era The Progressive Era in the United States was a period of social activism and political reform that flourished from the 1890s to the 1920s  The politics of the 1920s was unfriendly toward the labor unions and liberal crusaders against business  so many if not all historians who emphasize those themes write off the decade  Urban cosmopolitan scholars recoiled at the moralism of prohibition and the intolerance of the nativists of the Ku Klux Klan  KKK   and denounced the era  Richard Hofstadter  for example  in 1955 wrote that prohibition   was a pseudo reform  a pinched  parochial substitute for reform  that  was carried about America by the rural evangelical virus   37  However as Arthur S  Link emphasized  the progressives did not simply roll over and play dead  38  Link s argument for continuity through the 1920s stimulated a historiography that found Progressivism to be a potent force  Palmer  pointing to people like George Norris  say   It is worth noting that progressivism  whilst temporarily losing the political initiative  remained popular in many western states and made its presence felt in Washington during both the Harding and Coolidge presidencies   39  Gerster and Cords argue that   Since progressivism was a  spirit  or an  enthusiasm  rather than an easily definable force with common goals  it seems more accurate to argue that it produced a climate for reform which lasted well into the 1920s  if not beyond   40  Even the Klan has been seen in a new light  as numerous social historians reported that Klansmen were  ordinary white Protestants  primarily interested in purification of the system  which had long been a core progressive goal  41   edit  Business Progressivism What historians have identified as  business progressivism   with its emphasis on efficiency and typified by Henry Ford and Herbert Hoover 42  reached an apogee in the 1920s  Wik  for example  argues that Ford s  views on technology and the mechanization of rural America were generally enlightened  progressive  and often far ahead of his times   43  Tindall stresses the continuing importance of the Progressive movement in the South in the 1920s involving increased democracy  efficient government  corporate regulation  social justice  and governmental public service  44  45  William Link finds political progressivism dominant in most of the South in the 1920s  46  Likewise it was influential in Midwest  47  Historians of women and of youth emphasize the strength of the progressive impulse in the 1920s  48  Women consolidated their gains after the success of the suffrage movement  and moved into causes such as world peace  49  good government  maternal care  the Sheppard Towner Act of 1921   50  and local support for education and public health  51  The work was not nearly as dramatic as the suffrage crusade  but women voted 52  and operated quietly and effectively  Paul Fass  speaking of youth  says  Progressivism as an angle of vision  as an optimistic approach to social problems  was very much alive   53  The international influences which had sparked a great many reform ideas likewise continued into the 1920s  as American ideas of modernity began to influence Europe  54  There is general agreement that that the Progressive era was over by 1932  especially since a majority of the remaining progressives opposed the New Deal  55   edit  Canadian politics Canadian politics were dominated federally by the Liberal Party of Canada under William Lyon Mackenzie King  The federal government spent most of the decade disengaged from the economy and focused on paying off the large debts amassed during the war and during the era of railway over expansion  After the booming wheat economy of the early part of the century  the prairie provinces were troubled by low wheat prices  This played an important role in the development of Canada s first highly successful third party  the Progressive Party of Canada that won the second most seats in the 1921 national election  As well with the creation of the Balfour Declaration of 1926 Canada achieved with other British former colonies autonomy  creating the British Commonwealth   edit  End of the Roaring Twenties  edit  Black Tuesday Main article  Wall Street Crash of 1929 The Dow Jones Industrial Stock Index had continued its upward move for weeks  and coupled with heightened speculative activities  it gave an illusion that the bull market of 1928 to 1929 would last forever  On October 29  1929  also known as Black Tuesday  stock prices on Wall Street collapsed  The events in the United States added to a worldwide depression  later called the Great Depression  that put millions of people out of work across the world throughout the 1930s   edit  Repeal of Prohibition The 21st Amendment  which repealed the 18th Amendment  was proposed on February 20  1933  The choice to legalize alcohol was left up to the states  and many states quickly took this opportunity to allow alcohol   edit  References   Hakim  Joy  1995   War  Peace  and All That Jazz  New York  Oxford University Press  pp  41 46  ISBN 0 19
