activities both within the United States and Puerto Rican governments  The basic question regarding this issue is whether Puerto Rico should remain a U S  territory  become a U S  state  or become an independent country  These political activities have revolved around three sets of initiatives  referenda held in Puerto Rico  presidential executive orders  and bills in the U  S  Congress  Puerto Rican status referenda have been held four times to determine the political status of the island of Puerto Rico in relation to the United States of America  U  S  Presidents have issued three executive orders on the subject  and Congress has considered some four major bills related to the Puerto Rico political status situation  Politically  Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States which according to the U S  Supreme Court s Insular Cases is  a territory appurtenant and belonging to the United States  but not a part of the United States   1  Contents 1 Background 1

Background The United States acquired the islands of Puerto Rico in 1898 after the Spanish American War  In 1950  Congress enacted legislation  P L  81 600  authorizing Puerto Rico to hold a constitutional convention and in 1952  the people of Puerto Rico ratified a constitution establishing a republican form of government for the island  After being approved by Congress and the President in July 1952 and thus given force under federal law  P L  82 447   the new constitution went into effect on July 25  1952  Puerto Rico has been under U S  sovereignty for over a century and Puerto Ricans have been U S  citizens since 1917  2  3  4  Since the promulgation of the current Commonwealth constitution in 1952  further local attempts to change the island s political status took place in 1967  1993  and 1998  An additional referendum held in 1991 sought to amend the relationship through an amendment to the Puerto Rican constitution  Each time  the results favored retaining the current status over the possible independence of Puerto Rico and statehood alternatives  As a result of Puerto Rico s status as a U S  territory  the citizens of Puerto Rico do not have any voting representation in the U S  Federal government  Instead of outright representation through Senators and House Representatives  Puerto Rico has only one non voting Resident Commissioner in the House of Representatives  Furthermore  Puerto Rico is not represented in the Electoral College  and thus U S  citizens resident there are ineligible to vote in United States presidential elections  Although Puerto Rico presently has a certain amount of local autonomy  according to the U S  Constitution ultimate governance of the island is retained by both the U S  Congress and President  5  6  7  Thus  results of plebiscites  whether or not authorized by Congress  while they reflect public sentiment  and thus bear some impact  can be ignored by Congress  Ultimately  the results of Puerto Rican plebiscites are opinions  although congressional resolutions have expressed support for following the will of the Puerto Rican people  8  broken citation   edit  Federal Relations Act United States Public Law 81 600  P L  81 600   which authorized the process that led to the constitution of 1952  also continued the provisions of the Jones Act of 1917 that govern the relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States  That set of provisions is commonly referred to as the Federal Relations Act  FRA  48 U S C    731  The provisions of the Federal Relations Act as codified on the U S  Code Title 48  Chapter 4 shall apply to the island of Puerto Rico and to the adjacent islands belonging to the United States and waters of those islands  and the name Puerto Rico  as used in the chapter  shall be held to include not only the island of that name  but all the adjacent islands as aforesaid  9  The FRA includes provisions originally contained in the Organic Act of 1917  39 Stat  951  that established a civil government in Puerto Rico  The act of 1917 is referred to as the Jones Act  The Jones Act of 1917 was the second organic act Congress approved for Puerto Rico  the first was the Foraker Act approved by Congress in 1900  31 Stat  77   The FRA deals with matters that are subject to congressional authority and established pursuant to federal legislation  such as the citizenship status of residents  civil rights  trade and commerce  taxation and public finance  the administration of public lands controlled by the federal government  the application of federal law over navigable waters  congressional representation  and the judicial process  Although the constitution of 1952 provides for self government by Puerto Ricans  Congress ceded none of its own plenary authority over the islands  From time to time Congress has reasserted that authority by enacting legislation pertinent to local matters  For example  Congress amended FRA provisions dealing with local urban development and slum clearance authority in 1955  See 48 U S C    914  10   edit  Terminology The current English term   commonwealth   used to describe Puerto Rico politically is the same terminology used elsewhere but with other entirely different meanings than what is meant for Puerto Rico  Commonwealth is what four states of the American Union have named themselves  these being Kentucky  Massachusetts  Pennsylvania  and Virginia  A number of independent states use  Commonwealth  in their style  such as the Commonwealth of Australia or the Commonwealth of The Bahamas  historically  Iceland and the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth have also used the style in English  Here it relates to its original definition  as a translation of the Latin res publica  Commonwealth is part of the name of the Commonwealth of Nations  a group of independent nations  voluntarily joined by common bonds of various kinds and whose bonds are subject to unilateral revocation by any of the parties  Commonwealth is also used in the Commonwealth of Independent States  formerly parts of the Soviet Union  but a now group of independent nations  voluntarily joined by common bonds of various kinds  But in the U S    commonwealth  is also a term  without a clear and stable legal definition  now and previously used by current and past possessions of the United States  Commonwealth was a term used by the Philippines before gaining its independence from the U S  in 1947 and becoming a republic  prior to which the US Supreme Court had declared it was an unincorporated territory of the United States  11  Commonwealth is the term used by the U S  territory of the Northern Mariana Islands  a country that is still  unquestionably a colony in light of the decolonization criteria adopted by the United Nations  and  which  is openly treated as a territory by the government of the United States   12  Commonwealth term definition as per current U S  State Department policy  as codified in the department s Foreign Affairs Manual  reads   The term  Commonwealth  does not describe or provide for any specific political status or relationship  It has  for example  been applied to both states and territories  When used in connection with areas under U S  sovereignty that are not states  the term broadly describes an area that is self governing under a constitution of its adoption and whose right of self government will not be unilaterally withdrawn by Congress   13  Juan R  Torruella  a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit  the Federal Appeals Court with jurisdiction over the Federal Court for the District of Puerto Rico   claims that the use of the term commonwealth is a label that  can deceive and obscure the true nature of things   He contends that Puerto Rico is obviously not a state  and that  neither Puerto Rico s status nor its relationship with the U S  supports any legitimate claim that a British type of  commonwealth  exists between Puerto Rico and the United States   14   edit  The Insular Cases It has been said that  any inquiry into Puerto Rico s status must begin with the Constitution of the United States  as well as various Supreme Court and lower court decisions   15  Almost immediately after Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States  Puerto Rico s political status was defined by a series of landmark decisions made by the U S  Supreme Court in what are collectively known as The Insular Cases  From 1901   1905  the U S  Supreme Court in a series of opinions held that the Constitution extended ex propio vigore to the territories  However  the Court in these cases also established the doctrine of territorial incorporation  Under the same  the Constitution only applied fully in incorporated territories such as Alaska and Hawaii  whereas it only applied partially in the new unincorporated territories of Puerto Rico  Guam and the Philippines  Although other cases followed  strictly speaking the Insular Cases are the original six opinions issued concerning acquired territories as a result of the Treaty of Paris  1898   The six cases were  16  De Lima v  Bidwell  182 U S  1  1901  A plaintiff challenged the imposition of duties for the import of sugar from Puerto Rico to the United States proper  The Court sided with the plaintiff holding that Puerto Rico was not a  foreign country  and hence the duties were invalid  17  Goetze v  United States  Crossman v  United States   182 U S  221  1901  Dooley v  United States  182 U S  222  1901  Armstrong v  United States  182 U S  243  1901  Downes v  Bidwell  182 U S  244  1901  Considered the leading Insular case  concluded that the U S  could acquire territory and exercise unrestricted power in determining what rights to concede to its inhabitants  It included the  fateful phrase  that 18    While in an international sense Porto Rico  sic  was not a foreign country  since it was subject to the sovereignty of and was owned by the United States  it was foreign to the United States in a domestic sense  because the island has not been incorporated into the United States  but was merely appurtenant thereto as a possession   19  The case created the constitutionally unprecedented category of  unincorporated territories   20  Huus v  New York and Porto Rico Steamship Co   182 U S  392  1901  Other authorities  such as Jos  Tr as Monge  state that the list also includes these additional two cases  18  Dooley v  United States  183 U S  151  1901  Fourteen Diamond Rings v  United States  183 U S  176  1901  The Supreme Court later made other rulings  For example  in Balzac v  Porto Rico  258 U S  298  305  1922   explained the distinction between an incorporated and a non incorporated territory  Juan R  Torruella restated it this way   an unincorporated territory is a territory as to which  when acquired by the United States  no clear intention was expressed that it would eventually be incorporated into the Union as a State   21  Since the Insular Cases had established that only those rights in the U S  Bill of Rights that are determined to be  fundamental  are applicable in unincorporated territories  the implications of Balzac v  Porto Rico have been enormous  For example  The Court held that the right to trial by jury in not a fundamental right  and thus need not be given to criminal defendants in Puerto Rico  14   see Dorr v  United States  22  See also Balzac v  Porto Rico 23  24  The Court relied on Downes and Balzac to justify the outright denial of Supplemental Security Income  SSI  to United States citizens who had relocated to Puerto Rico from the States  This ruling allowed Congress to deny Supplemental Security Income  SSI  payments to the aged and benefits to children and the poor who reside in Puerto Rico  even in the case of an insured who had worked all his life as a resident of the States proper but then moved to live in Puerto Rico  25  26   see Califano v  Torres  435 U S  1  1978   per curiam   In a brief concurrence in the United States Supreme Court judgment of Torres v  Puerto Rico  442 U S  465  1979   U S  Supreme Court Justice Brennan  argued that any implicit limits from the Insular Cases on the basic rights granted by the Constitution  including especially the Bill of Rights  were anachronistic in the 1970s  27   edit  Implications of the current political status  edit  Level of autonomy Under the Constitution of Puerto Rico  Puerto Rico designates itself with the term Commonwealth and Puerto Ricans have a degree of administrative autonomy similar to citizens of a U S  state and like the States  it has a republican form of government  organized pursuant to a constitution adopted by its people  and a bill of rights  The constitution  approved by the U S  congress  went into effect in 1952  In addition  like the States  Puerto Rico lacks  the full sovereignty of an independent nation   for example  the power to manage its  external relations with other nations   which was retained by the Federal Government  Constitutionally  Puerto Rico is subject to the Congress  plenary powers under the territorial clause of Article IV  sec  3  of the U S  Constitution  28  U S  federal law applies to Puerto Rico  even though Puerto Rico is not a state of the American Union and their residents have no voting representation in the U S  Congress  Because of the establishment of the Federal Relations Act of 1950  all federal laws that are  not locally inapplicable  are automatically the law of the land in Puerto Rico  29  30  Following the 1950 and 1952 legislation  only two district court decisions have held that a particular federal law  which does not specifically exclude or treat Puerto Rico differently  is inapplicable to Puerto Rico  The more recent decision was vacated on appeal  31  Efr n Rivera Ramos  Dean and Professor of Law at the University of Puerto Rico School of Law  32  clarified the meaning of plenary powers  explaining   The government of a state derives its powers from the people of the state  whereas the government of a territory owes its existence wholly to the United States  The Court thus seems to equate plenary power to exclusive power  The U S  government could exert over the territory power that it could not exercise over the states   Ramos quotes Justice Harlan  writing in Grafton v  United States  206 U S  333  1907    The jurisdiction and authority of the United States over that territory  referring to the Philippines  and its inhabitants  for all legitimate purposes of government is paramount    Ramos then goes on to argue  This power  however  is not absolute  for it is restrained by some then undefined fundamental rights possessed by anyone subject to the authority of the U S  government   33  On November 30  1992  President George H  W  Bush issued a memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico  This memorandum directs all federal departments  agencies  and officials to treat Puerto Rico administratively as if it were a state  insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operations   edit  Citizenship Since 1917  people born in Puerto Rico have been given U S  citizenship  United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico  whether born there or not  are not residents of a state or the District of Columbia and  therefore  do not qualify to vote  personally or through an absentee ballot  in federal elections  See also   Voting rights in Puerto Rico   Puerto Ricans  were collectively made U S  citizens  in 1917 as a result of the Jones Shafroth Act  34  The act was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson on March 2 1917  Clarification of federal law codified on U S  Code Title 8 as 8 U S C    1402  approved by President Harry S  Truman on June 27 1952  declared all persons born in Puerto Rico on or after January 13 1941 to be U S  citizens at birth and all persons born in Puerto Rico between April 11 1899 and January 12 1941  and meeting certain other technical requirements  and not citizens of the United States under any other Act  are declared to be citizens of the U S  as of January 13 1941  35  In addition  an April 2000 report by the Congressional Research Service  asserts that citizens born in Puerto Rico are legally defined as natural born citizens and are therefore eligible to be elected President  provided they meet qualifications of age and 14 years residence within the United States  According to this report  residence in Puerto Rico and U S  territories and possessions does not qualify as residence within the United States for these purposes  36   edit  Rights of residents Since Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory  see above  and not a U S  state  the United States Constitution does not fully enfranchise US citizens residing in Puerto Rico  35  37  Only the  fundamental rights  under the federal constitution apply to Puerto Rico  including the Privileges and Immunities Clause  U S  Constitution  Article IV  Section 2  Clause 1  also known as the Comity Clause  that prevents a state from treating citizens of other states in a discriminatory manner  with regard to basic civil rights  The clause also embraces a right to travel  so that a citizen of one state can have privileges and immunities in any other state  this constitutional clause regarding the rights  privileges  and immunities of citizens of the United States was expressly extended to Puerto Rico by the U S  Congress through the federal law codified on the Title 48 of the United States Code as 48 U S C    737 and signed by President Truman in 1947  37  38  39  The Supreme Court has indicated that once the Constitution has been extended to an area  by Congress or the Courts   its coverage is irrevocable  To hold that the political branches may switch the Constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they  not this Court  say  what the law is    40  Other fundamental rights such as the Eleventh Amendment and the Dormant Commerce Clause were expressly extended by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit  and the First Amendment  Fourth Amendment  Fifth Amendment  the due process clause and the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment were expressly extended to Puerto Rico by the U S  Supreme court  41  42  43  44  45  In a brief concurrence in the judgment of Torres v  Puerto Rico  46  Supreme Court Justice Brennan argued that any implicit limits from the Insular Cases on the basic rights granted by the Constitution  including especially the Bill of Rights  were anachronistic in the 1970s  47  48  49   edit  Judiciary Article Three of the United States Constitution establishes the judicial branch of the federal government  This article was expressly extended to the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico by the U S  Congress through Federal Law 89 571  80 Stat  764  signed by President Lyndon B  Johnson in 1966  After that date  judges appointed to the Puerto Rico federal district court have been Article III judges appointed under the Constitution of the United States  In addition  in 1984 one of the judges of the federal district court  Chief Judge Juan R  Torruella  a native of the island  was appointed to serve in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit with jurisdiction over Puerto Rico  Massachusetts  Rhode Island  Maine  and New Hampshire  47   edit  Federal presence Federal executive branch agencies have significant presence in Puerto Rico  just as in any state  such as the U S  Customs and Border Protection  U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  U S  Attorney  Federal Bureau of Investigation  Homeland Security  National Labor Relations Board  Federal Emergency Management Agency  Transportation Security Administration  Environmental Protection Agency  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  Internal Revenue Service  and Social Security Administration  The island s economic  commercial  and banking systems are integrated to those of the United States  47   edit  Taxation The U S  Government classifies Puerto Rico as an independent taxation authority by Federal Law codified on the Title 48 of the United States Code as 48 U S C    734  Puerto Rico residents are required to pay U S  federal taxes  import export taxes  50  federal commodity taxes  51  social security taxes etc  Individuals working with the Federal Government pay federal income taxes while the rest of the residents are required to pay federal payroll taxes  Social Security 52  and Medicare   53  as well as Commonwealth of Puerto Rico income taxes  All federal employees  54  plus those who do business with the federal government  55  in addition to Puerto Rico based corporations that intend to send funds to the U S   56  and some others 57  also pay federal income taxes  In 2009  Puerto Rico paid  3 742 billion into the US Treasury  58  Because residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security  they are eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement  but are excluded from the Supplemental Security Income  SSI   and the island actually receives less than 15  of the Medicaid funding it would normally receive if it were a U S  state  59  Yet Medicare providers receive less than full state like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in Puerto Rico  even though the latter paid fully into the system  60   edit  Political participation Since 1961  several Puerto Ricans have been appointed by the President  upon the advice and consent of the Senate to serve as United States Ambassadors to Venezuela  Spain  Costa Rica  Chile  the Dominican Republic  and the Republics of Mauritius and Seychelles  A Puerto Rican was also appointed by President Obama as ambassador to El Salvador  Pending the advice and consent of the United States Senate  the President issued a recess appointment so that the Ambassador could assume her post  61  As embassies fall within the Department of State  ambassadors answer to the Secretary of State  62  Puerto Rico does participate in the internal political process of both the Democratic and Republican parties in the U S   accorded equal proportional representation in both parties  and delegates from the islands vote in each party s national convention   edit  Military service Puerto Ricans may enlist in the U S  military  Since 1917  Puerto Ricans have been included in the compulsory draft whenever it has been in effect and more than 400 000 Puerto Ricans have served in the United States Armed Forces  Puerto Ricans have participated in all U S  wars since 1898  most notably World War I  World War II  the Korean and Vietnam wars  as well as the current Middle Eastern conflicts  Several Puerto Ricans became notable commanders  five have been awarded the Medal of Honor  the highest military decoration in the United States  and several Puerto Ricans have attained the rank of General or Admiral  which requires a Presidential nomination and Senate confirmation  as is the case of judges and ambassadors  47  In World War II  63  the Korean War 64  and the Vietnam War 65  Puerto Ricans were the most decorated Hispanic soldiers and in some cases were the first to die in combat  66  67   edit  Status questions Elections in Puerto Rico Federal government Resident Commissioner 1900

territory since 1898  and known as  Estado Libre Asociado   Free Associated State  or as commonwealth since 1952  Puerto Rico today is torn by profound ideological rifts  as represented by its political parties  which stand for three distinct future political scenarios  the status quo  commonwealth   statehood  and independence  The Popular Democratic Party  PPD  seeks to maintain or improve the current status towards becoming a more sovereign territory of the U S   the New Progressive Party  PNP  seeks to fully incorporate Puerto Rico as a U S  state  and the Puerto Rican Independence Party  PIP  seeks national independence  When asked  in non binding plebiscites  to choose between independence  statehood  or continuation of the present status with enhanced powers  as proposed by the Popular Democratic Party  Puerto Ricans have voted to remain a commonwealth  In the most recent of these plebisites  in 1998  Puerto Ricans  by a slight majority  voted for  none of the above   a choice that has been variously interpreted   One might say  looking at the result of the 1998 plebicite  that the people of Puerto Rico exercised their inalienable right to self determination  and a majority of them fully 50 3 percent  to be exact chose to remain a colony  One might also say  however  the oldest strategy for governing recalcitrant subjects divide and conquer was subtly at work   68  69  One thing is clear  however  dissatisfaction with the current status is evident  The issue is still being debated and is on the agenda of all the political parties and civil society groups  Several pro commonwealth leaders within the PPD are proposing an Associated Republic or Free Association similar to that of the former U S  territories of the Federated States of Micronesia  Marshall Islands or Palau   edit  Plebiscites In general  three main alternatives are presented to Puerto Rican voters in status plebiscites  Full independence Maintenance or enhancement of commonwealth status Full statehood The exact expectations for each of these status formulas are a matter of debate by a given position s adherents and detractors  Puerto Ricans have proposed positions that modify the alternatives above  such as  Indemnified Independence with phased out US subsidy Expanded political but not fiscal autonomy Statehood with a gradual phasing out of federal tax exemption  Contrary to common misconception  residents of Puerto Rico pay U S  federal taxes  import export taxes  federal commodity taxes  social security taxes  etc  Most residents do not pay

71  The exact significance of referendum results is debated by local observers  The 1967 results showed strong support for maintaining the commonwealth  but this victory was followed by the first loss in twenty years of governorship by the Popular Democratic Party  the main supporter of the commonwealth association  This occurred in part because of bickering leadership  The 1993 results appear to protest the ideas or forum used to change status as imposed by the then ruling Popular Democratic Party  the demands were controversial because there was no assurance  and great doubt  that they would be accepted by Congress  The 1998 results  where  none of the above   which was the PPD sponsored choice was the winner  protested criteria set forth by the then ruling New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico   edit  The 1967 plebiscite Main article  Puerto Rican status referendum  1967 In 1967  the Legislative Assembly tested the political interests of the Puerto Rican people by passing a local Plebiscite Act that allowed a vote on the status of Puerto Rico  This constituted the first plebiscite by the Legislature for a choice on three status options  At 60 4  percent of the vote  the commonwealth option won the majority vote  Following this plebiscite  efforts in the 1970s to enact legislation to address the status issue died in congressional committees   edit  The 1991 Constitutional Amendment Referendum Main article  Puerto Rican constitutional referendum  1991 The 1991 Referendum on the proposed  Claim to Democratic Rights  asked the voters to approve the addition of an amendment to the Puerto Rican constitution  The wording of this amendment would guarantee  The inalienable right to freely and democratically determine Puerto Rico s political status  The right to choose a dignified  non colonial  non territorial status not subordinate to plenary powers of Congress  The right to vote for three alternatives  The right that only results with a majority will be considered triumphant in a plebiscite  The right that any status would protect Puerto Rico s culture  language and identity  and continued independent participation in international sports events  The right that any status guarantees the individual s right to American citizenship  Passage of this referendum would have constituted a claim for the government of Puerto Rico to establish these rights in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico constitution and petition the President and Congress for these rights  but it was rejected by the people of Puerto Rico on a vote of 660 264  53   against to 559 259  44 9   in favor  78  As per the Congressional Research Service report  despite PDP and PIP support  a majority  53   voted against the proposal  Some contended that the decision to schedule the referendum represented an indirect step to block statehood  Others perceived the rejection to reflect dissatisfaction with the governor  Another explanation offered for the vote was that some cast their ballots out of fear that a  yes  vote would result in a further degradation of federal benefits and the loss of U S  citizenship  79   edit  The 1993 plebiscite Main article  Puerto Rican status referendum  1993 A subsequent plebiscite was organized by the Puerto Rican government in 1993  in which the Congress played a more substantial role  where  at 48 6   the commonwealth status managed to win a plurality  though not a majority vote  The current political status  status quo  failed to receive the majority support it sought  80  81  U S  Congress played a more substantial role in the 1993 plebiscite than it did in the 1967 plebiscite  In the 1992 election campaign  the PNP candidate for governor urged  and the legislature agreed  that a plebiscite on status be held  after the U S  Congress failed to approve  status legislation  Since definitions on the ballot were formulated by the political parties themselves  neither Congress nor executive branch officials intervened to ensure that the alternatives presented to the voters would pass constitutional muster  The disconnect between the ballot option and constitutional requirements was summarized in the House report accompanying legislation introduced three years after the plebiscite  as follows  The 1993 definition of  Commonwealth  failed to present the voters with status options consistent with full self government  and it was misleading to propose to the voters an option which was unconstitutional and unacceptable to the Congress in almost every respect  No option on the ballot in 1993 received a majority of votes  Some contend that statehood may have suffered the greatest loss  considering the governor and the legislature were members of the PNP and the plebiscite itself was a major campaign promise for the governor  Others may argue that PDP advocates did not achieve a final victory in the 1993 vote because Congress rejected the commonwealth option presented on ballots  In the end  Commonwealth status was again upheld in the 1993 plebiscite  79  82   edit  The 1998 plebiscite Main article  Puerto Rican status referendum  1998 In the last locally organized plebiscite held in Puerto Rico  which took place on December 13  1998  the current status quo  Commonwealth status  received less than one tenth of one percent  0 06   of the total vote  83  The majority vote went to a  none of the above  option which received 50 3   This was followed by the statehood option which received 46 7   The option of independence received 2 5  of the vote  Five alternatives were listed on the ballot   limited self government    free association    statehood    sovereignty   and  none of the above   Disputes arose as to the definition of each of the ballot alternatives  and commonwealth advocates  among others  reportedly urged a vote for  none of the above   They asserted that the commonwealth definition on the ballot  failed to recognize both the constitutional protections afforded to our U S  citizenship and the fact that the relationship is based upon the mutual consent of Puerto Rico and the United States   In the end  a slim majority of voters in that plebiscite selected  none of the above   50 3    84   edit  Definition of Status Options The resulting political climate after the 1998 plebiscite reflected the need for proper definitions of status options  In its June  2011  Political Status of Puerto Rico  Options for Congress report  the Congressional Research Service states that the  definitions or  more specifically  the lack of definitions of the political status options for Puerto Rico  compound the complexity of the debate   10  The report stated that constitutional implications of three status options   new commonwealth   statehood  and independence  were reviewed by the Department of Justice in response to a congressional request  The history of debate  particularly the 1998 plebiscite  indicates that in the absence of constitutionally valid status options and definitions acceptable to Congress  the debate over status yields few or no conclusive results  The brief summaries of the options analysis on pages 26 and 27 of the report follow   edit  Commonwealth  The commonwealth option represents a continuation of the current status of Puerto Rico  The territorial clause of the United States Constitution empowers Congress with the authority to regulate territories  Commonwealth status for Puerto Rico is based on statutory provisions and the Constitution of Puerto Rico that established a republican form of self government   Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act  P L  81 600  64 Stat  319   Under current federal law  residents of Puerto Rico enjoy U S  citizenship  but many contend that the Puerto Rican identity reflects a degree of autonomy that enables the island to remain somewhat separate from  but part of  the United States  On the 1992   Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies  of President George H W  Bush  it described the relationship of the Commonwealth to the United States with regard to the administration of federal programs  as follows   Because Puerto Rico s degree of constitutional self government  population  and size set it apart from other areas also subject to federal jurisdiction under Article IV  section 3  clause 2 of the Constitution  I hereby direct all federal departments  agencies  and officials  to the extent consistent with the Constitution and the laws of the United States  hence forward to treat Puerto Rico administratively as if it were a state  except insofar as doing so with respect to an existing federal program or activity would increase or decrease federal receipts or expenditures  or would seriously disrupt the operation of such program or activity   Some support an enhanced or  new  commonwealth status and seek changes in the current relationship to increase the autonomy of Puerto Rico  Aspects of enhanced commonwealth considered but rejected by Congress in 1991 and 2001 included providing the government of Puerto Rico authority to certify that certain federal laws would not be applicable to the commonwealth  mandating that the President consult with the governor on appointments to federal offices in Puerto Rico that require Senate approval  recognizing a permanent relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States that cannot be unilaterally changed  and establishing economic relationships with other nations  Concepts associated with enhanced or new commonwealth have not been published in 2005  but the former governor has reportedly sought additional sovereign authority that would enable Puerto Rico s government officials to negotiate international agreements and establish new intergovernmental fiscal relations with the federal government  The Department of Justice  Raben Letter  found that certain aspects of a  New Commonwealth  proposal described in PDP platform documents could be  or are   constitutionally unenforceable  or flawed  mutual consent provisions and delegation of powers   of uncertain legality  statutory citizenship  and international agreements  and possibly subject to constitutional limits  Resident Commissioner authority    10   edit  Free Association  This option would establish Puerto Rico as a sovereign nation separate from  but legally bound  on a terminable basis  to  the United States  As a general practice  free association would be preceded by recognition that Puerto Rico is a self governing sovereign nation not part of the United States  because compacts of free association are legal documents between sovereign nations  Free association could be accompanied by a transition period in which the United States would continue to administer certain services and provide assistance to the island for a period of time specified in the compact  Free association could be annulled at any time by either nation  Negotiations over free association would likely decide issues of trade  defense  currency  and economic aid   10   edit  Independence  Some advocates of independence contend that the cultural identity of Puerto Ricans  and other factors  justify independence  As residents of a sovereign independent nation  Puerto Ricans could develop closer ties to Caribbean nations  but would likely be forced to choose between citizenship in the United States or in Puerto Rico  The current unrestricted travel between the United States and the island might end  as would federal benefits  unless specified in the enabling legislation   Puerto Rico would  as a sovereign nation  develop its own economy  form of government  and complete national identity   10   edit  Statehood  Advocates of statehood contend that the full rights and responsibilities of citizenship should be granted to residents of Puerto Rico  Political stability  particularly as an economic development tool  is seen by some to be one significant advantage of statehood  As residents of a state  Puerto Ricans would be entitled to full representation in Congress  would be subject to income taxes  and would be eligible to receive federal assistance like that provided to all of the states  Opponents argue that statehood would result in a loss of national identity   10   edit  2012 plebiscite proposal Main article  Puerto Rican status referendum  2012 The governor of Puerto Rico set August 12  2012  as the date to hold the first part of two status referendums  If a second status vote is required  it will take place on November 6  2012   The first referendum will ask voters whether they want to maintain the current commonwealth status under the territorial clause of the U S  Constitution or whether they prefer a nonterritorial option  If more voters check that nonterritorial option  a second vote would be held giving people three status options  statehood  independence or free association   85  A bill was brought before the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico in 2011 to effect the governor s proposal  The bill passed on December 28  2011  Both referendums  however  will be held on a single ballot on November 6  2012  86   edit  Congressionally mandated plebiscites No congressionally mandated plebiscite has ever been held  and average voter turnout in the locally enacted status votes has been about 10  lower than in general elections  8  broken citation  87  However  various bills have been introduced in Congress to effect a plebiscite backed by Congress and to which Congress would be committed   edit  Presidential Executive Orders  edit  2005 Presidential Task Force Report In December 2005  a Report 88  by the President s Task Force on Puerto Rico s Status 89  90  asserted that the Constitution of the United States does not allow for a mechanism  to bind future Congresses to any particular arrangement for Puerto Rico as a Commonwealth  without an amendment to the Constitution of the United States  90  The report also stated that Puerto Rico s current status  does not meet the criteria for any of the options for full self government   90  The Report made its determinations based on articles in the U S  Constitution regarding territories  Prominent leaders in Puerto Rico s pro independence political movements agreed with this assessment  Leaders in the pro statehood political movements also agreed with the assessment  The Legislative Branch  then controlled by the pro statehood New Progressive Party  PNP   supported the White House report s conclusions and has supported bills introduced by Congressmen Jos  Serrano  D NY  and Luis Fortu o  R PR  and Senators Ken Salazar  D CO  and Mel Martinez  R FL  to provide for a democratic referendum process among Puerto Rico voters  The Popular Democratic Party  PPD   on the other hand  announced a commitment to challenge the Task Force report and validate the current status in all international forums including the United Nations  It also rejected any  colonial or territorial status  as a status option  and vowed to keep working for the enhanced Commonwealth status that was approved by the PPD in 1998  which included sovereignty  an association based on  respect and dignity between both nations   and common citizenship  91  The task force recommendations were rejected by the former governor of Puerto Rico Anibal Acevedo Vil  on a letter on January 24  2006  who condemned the report and rejected  any efforts to turn the task force s recommendations into Congressional legislation   The former governor  among others  argued that the  Commonwealth  or  in some cases   Enhanced Commonwealth  constructs are legitimate non territorial options under U  S  constitutional and statutory law   92  In a letter sent by then governor Acevedo Vil  to the former U S  Secretary of State  Condoleezza Rice and the Bush Administration Co Chairs of the President s Task Force on Puerto Rico s Status  the former governor stated 93  94  that  if the Task Force and the Bush Administration stand by their 2005 conclusions  then for over 50 years the U S Government has perpetuated a  monumental hoax  on the people of Puerto Rico  on the people of the United States and on the international community  If the 2005 report articulates the new official position of the United States  the time has come now for the State Department to formally notify the United Nations of this new position and assume the international legal consequences  You cannot have a legal and constitutional interpretation for local  political purposes and a different one for the international community   95  On January 4  2006  then governor Vil  and the Popular Democratic Party challenged the task force report with a resolution that denounced the task force as a political fraud and threat to democracy  and called the report s conclusion a violation of the basic agreements held between the people of Puerto Rico and the United States since 1952  96  not in citation given  97  98  A bill supporting the PPD s position was introduced in the United States Senate on February 16  2006  by two senators who have traditionally been identified with Puerto Rico  Senators Edward M  Kennedy  D MA  and Bob Menendez  D NJ  and two senators whose interest in matters related to Puerto Rico was up to then unknown  Senators Richard Mauze Burr  R NC  and Chester Trent Lott  99  Since its introduction  however  the bill did not attract any other co sponsors  A bipartisan Senate bill supporting the implementation of the White House report recommendations was filed by Senators Mel Martinez  R FL  and Ken Salazar  D CO  and co sponsored by 14 other Democratic and Republican senators  including Daniel Akaka  D HI   Evan Bayh  D IN   Samuel Brownback  R KS   Thomas Carper  D DE   Norm Coleman  R MN   Larry Craig  R ID   Charles Hagel  R NE   Daniel Inouye  D HI   John Kerry  D MA   Mary Landrieu  D LA   John McCain  R AZ   Ben Nelson  D NE   Bill Nelson  D FL  and Ted Stevens  R AK   100  Report By the President s Task Force On Puerto Rico s Status  December 2005   edit  2007 Presidential Task Force Report On December 21  2007  the President s Task Force on Puerto Rico s Political Status issued a second Report  This 2007 Report stated that the United States  in its written submission to the UN in 1953  never represented that the U S  Congress could not change its relationship with Puerto Rico without the territory s consent  101  It stated that the U S  Justice Department in 1959 reiterated that Congress held power over Puerto Rico pursuant to the Territorial Clause 102  of the U S  Constitution  89  In a 1996 report on a Puerto Rico status political bill  the  U S  House Committee on Resources stated that Puerto Rico s current status does not meet the criteria for any of the options for full self government   It concluded that Puerto Rico is still an unincorporated territory of the U S  under the territorial clause  that the establishment of local self government with the consent of the people can be unilaterally revoked by the U S  Congress  and that U S  Congress can also withdraw the U S  citizenship of Puerto Rico residents of Puerto Rico at any time  for a legitimate Federal purpose  103  The application of the American Constitution to Puerto Rico is limited by the Insular Cases  In essence  the December 2007 report reiterated and confirmed the U S  position that had been expressed in the report of 2005  89  90  that Puerto Rico continued to be a territory of the U S  under the plenary powers of the U S  Congress  104  broken citation  105  This position continues to be shared by the other two major political parties in Puerto Rico  New Progressive Party and the Puerto Rican Independence Party  8  broken citation  Report By the President s Task Force On Puerto Rico s Status  December 2007   edit  2011 Presidential Task Force Report On March 16  2011  the President s Task Force on Political Status issued a third report 106  which once again concludes that   u nder the Commonwealth option  Puerto Rico would remain  as it is today  subject to the Territory Clause of the U S  Constitution  p  26  and that  consistent with the legal conclusions reached by prior Task Force reports  one aspect of some proposals for enhanced Commonwealth remains constitutionally problematic proposals that would establish a relationship between Puerto Rico and the Federal Government that could not be altered except by mutual consent   such provisions would not be enforceable because a future Congress could choose to alter that relationship unilaterally    p  26   The Task Force also stated that  the long term economic well being of Puerto Rico would be dramatically improved by an early decision on the status question    p  33   before embarking on economic analysis and recommendations that constitute over two thirds of the report   edit  Bills in U S  Congress See also  The United States Puerto Rico Political Status Act and Puerto Rico Democracy Act The Territories Clause of the United States Constitution  Art  IV  Sec  3  cl  2  allows for Congress to  dispose of  Puerto Rico and allow it to become independent of the U S   in the same way as the Philippines did in 1945  or  under the authority of the Admissions Clause  Art  IV  Sec  3  cl  1  for it to be admitted as a state of the United States  with a vote of Congress in the same way that Alaska was in 1958 and Hawaii was in 1959   Since Congress must approve of any political status change for Puerto Rico  some argue that  congressional agreement to the options  on a ballot   prior to a plebiscite would save the people of Puerto Rico the grief of an emotionally draining and politically divisive vote that might result in a status not acceptable to Congress   107  Former Resident Commissioner and Former Governor Carlos Romero Barcel  echoed this sentiment when he recalled  at a 1997 congressional hearing  that both   Representatives  Young and Miller were clear in stating  in their March 3  1997  letter to the presidents of the three political parties in Puerto Rico  that there was no purpose in presenting the people of Puerto Rico a status definition which does not represent an option that the Congress will be willing to ratify should it be approved in a plebiscite   108  A catalyst for the legislative activity taking place in Congress was the release in December 2005 of the presidential task force s report  109  Per United States v  Sanchez  992 F 2d 1143  1152 53  11th Cir  1993    Congress continues to be the ultimate source of power  over Puerto Rico  pursuant to the Territory Clause of the Constitution    quoting United States v  Andino  831 F 2d 1164  1176  1st Cir  1987   Torruella  J   concurring   cert  denied  486 U S  1034  1988    cert  denied  510 U S  11 10  1994  9 110  An Act of Congress  thus  is ultimately required to modify the current political status of Puerto Rico   edit  The United States Puerto Rico Political Status Act  H R  856  In 1997  The United States Puerto Rico Political Status Act  H R  856  was introduced in Congress  passing in the House in 1998  but not in the Senate  The bill was legislative initiative by U S  House of Representatives to help refine the political status of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico  This bill  unlike any other bill in U S  Congress regarding the Puerto Rico political status issue  made its way to both chambers of Congress  The House considered four versions of the bill  The version approved on March 4  1998  which would have authorized referenda at least once every ten years  through which the people of Puerto Rico could indicate their preference among three status options   1   Puerto Rico should retain Commonwealth    2   The people of Puerto Rico should become fully self governing through separate sovereignty in the form of independence or free association   or  3   Puerto Rico should become fully self governing through Statehood   The Senate  however  did not take formal action on the measure  On September 17  1998  the Senate approved a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that   1  the Senate supports and recognizes the right of United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico to express democratically their views regarding their future political status through a referendum or other public forum  and to communicate those views to the President and Congress  and  2  the Federal Government should review any such communication   The version forwarded to the Senate offered Puerto Ricans these options for their political future  Statehood  Independence  Associated Republic  or the current Commonwealth status  The bill proposed to carry out a referendum in Puerto Rico in which the people of Puerto Rico could choose the option they preferred  111  The proposal  however  was controversial in Puerto Rican politics for two reasons  1  the legislation was encouraged by two avid statehood supporters  and seemed to favor unchangeable status choices over Commonwealth  and 2  the Commonwealth option in the bill defined Puerto Rico as a  territory subject to the supreme powers of the U S Congress   The Popular Democratic Party  PPD  disagreed with this definition that appeared to emphasize the island was a colony of the United States  and not a true commonwealth  The PPD thus fiercely opposed the H  R  856  because it diminished their sense of Commonwealth  Estado Libre Asociado  as agreement between two peoples  This reaction was consistent with the contents of the bill  since H  R  856  as officially ordered to be printed by its sponsor  Alaska Congressman Don Young  stated in its findings that Puerto Rico  does not have the status of  free association  with the United States as that status is defined under United States law or international practice   112  The travails of H R  856 in the House of Representatives exemplify the hurdles from conservative and liberal members of Congress that any status choices by Puerto Rico will likely face in Congress  113  The bill was introduced by representative Gerald Solomon  R NY   A number of amendments were debated  seeking  for example  to make English the official language  114  getting Congress to recognize that Puerto Rico is sociologically and culturally a Caribbean and Latin American nation with a distinctive culture  and recognizing the separate and distinct nature of Puerto Rican citizenship in relation to U S  citizenship  Ultimately the bill died in the Senate  In 2005  the U S  House Committee on Resources concluded that Puerto Rico is still an unincorporated territory of the United States under the Territorial Clause  that the establishment of local self government with the consent of the people can be unilaterally revoked by U S  Congress  and Congress can withdraw  at any time  the American citizenship now enjoyed by the residents of Puerto Rico as long as it achieves a legitimate Federal purpose  in a manner reasonably related to that purpose  115  In 2006  Resident Commissioner Luis Fortu o  R PR  and Rep  Jose E  Serrano  D NY  introduced a bipartisan House bill to implement the recommendations  which was cosponsored by over 60 Republicans and over 40 Democrats  significantly more cosponsors than the H R  856 bill which cleared the House in 1998  The House Committee on Resources called a hearing on the subject on April 27  2006  signaling a greater degree of interest than previously anticipated   edit  The Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2007  H R  900  At the beginning of the 110th Congress  2007 2008   Serrano and Fortu o introduced their bill again as H R  900  It was titled the Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2007  A first hearing was held by the Subcommittee on Insular Affairs in March 2007  A final hearing was held on April 25 to hear Governor An bal Acevedo Vil   Senate President Kenneth McClintock  Speaker Jos  Aponte and the White House Report s co author Kevin Marshall before the bill was brought to a full committee vote by Resources Committee chair Nick Rahall  D WV   On October 23  2007  that Resources Committee unanimously approved a substitute bill of H R  900  which establishes that before 2009  a first plebiscite will be held in which Puerto Ricans will be asked if they desire to maintain their territorial status  in a yes or no question  The bill states that should No be the favored choice  either another plebiscite asking between statehood  independence or an associated republic  or a constitutional assembly would follow thereafter  by choice of the United States Federal Court of Puerto Rico  The bill was never considered by the full United States House of Representatives and died with the end of the 110th Congress  The bill was introduced again in 2009  and passed the Resources Committee on July 28 of that year and the full House in 2010  but died in the Senate  During 2007  the Senate came up with its own version of the bill  S 1936  This bill  also titled the Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2007  aimed to provide for a plebiscite on the future status of Puerto Rico  116  However  it never made it out of Committee before that session of Congress was over   edit  The Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2009  H R  2499  In May 2009  Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi sponsored a new version of the Puerto Rico Democracy Act bill  H R  2499  now titled The Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2009  117  aimed at providing for  a federally sanctioned self determination process for the people of Puerto Rico   The bill  if enacted  would provide for referenda to be held in Puerto Rico to determine the Island s ultimate political status  The bill would provide for a referendum giving Puerto Ricans the choice between the options of  1  retaining their present political status  or  2  choosing a new status  118  If the latter option  2  were to win  then a separate referendum would be held where Puerto Ricans would be given the option of being admitted as a US State  on equal footing with the other states   or becoming a  sovereign nation  either fully independent from or in free association with the United States   If the first option garnished the most votes  a new referendum would be held again every 8 years  The bill enjoyed bi partisan support in the House of Representatives  with 182 co sponsors  119  On June 24  2009  the U S  House Committee on Natural Resources held a hearing on the bill with the participation of the Governor of Puerto Rico  and others like Jennifer Gonzalez  speaker of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives  Thomas Rivera Schatz  president of the Senate of Puerto Rico  120  The House Natural Resources Committee  approved the bill and referred it to the United States House of Representatives floor with a 30 in favor 8 against vote  121  The bill was passed by the House on April 29  2010  122  The U S  Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chair Senator Jeff Bingaman  D NM  and Ranking Member Senator Lisa Murkowski  R AK  formally requested the White House to share President s position regarding The Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2010  H R  2499  and constitutionally viable status alternatives in a letter dated May 27 following a hearing on the legislation  The Senators requested the President s Task Force on Puerto Rico s Status clarify the White House position on the issue  According to the Senate Energy  amp  Natural Resources Committee leadership  the four options are the continuation of the current commonwealth status  subject to the territorial clause  under Article IV of the Constitution   statehood  independence  and free association   Efforts to address Puerto Rico s political status have been hampered by a failure of the federal government to clearly define these status options and that failure has undermined Puerto Rico s efforts to accurately assess the views of the voters   the letter stated   In recent years  however  a consistent administration and congressional view has emerged that only four status options are available for Puerto Rico s future relations with the United States   Bingaman and Murkowski wrote that  this analysis of the status options favored by the principal political parties in Puerto Rico concludes that a fifth option   New Commonwealth   is incompatible with the Constitution and basic laws of the United States in several respects   according to the analysis and conclusion of the U S  Department of Justice under the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W  Bush  123  124  125  Absent a White House response to the Senate s request  the Senate did not act on H R  2499   edit  United Nations classification The United Nations has intervened in the past to evaluate the legitimacy of Puerto Rico s political status  to ensure that the island s government structure complies with the standards of self government that constitute the basic tenets of the United Nations Charter  its covenants  and its principles of international law  Some authorities  such as Trias Monge  sustain that  Puerto Rico clearly does not meet the decolonization standards set by the United Nations in 1960   126   edit  Resolution 748 During its 8th session  the United Nations General Assembly recognized Puerto Rico s self government on November 27  1953  with Resolution 748  VIII   127   UN Resolution  748  VIII    adopted on November 27  1953  during its 459th Plenary Meeting   This removed Puerto Rico s classification as a non self governing territory  under article 73 e  of the Charter of the United Nations   The resolution passed  garnering a favorable vote from some 40  of the General Assembly  with over 60  abstaining or voting against it  20 to 16  plus 18 abstentions   Today  however   the United Nations still debates whether Puerto Rico is a colony   128   edit  UN vote aftermath However  Puerto Rico s political status is still debated in many international forums  possibly in part because of the circumstances surrounding the vote   Under United States pressure  General Assembly Resolution 748 passed though only narrowly and with many countries abstaining  The debate over Resolution 748 prompted the United Nations to agree on governing arrangements that would provide full self government to non self governing territories  in United States terms  these arrangements were statehood  independence  and free association  Yet  under international law  a freely associated state is a sovereign nation in a joint governing arrangement with another nation that either nation can unilaterally end   129  Though the subject continues to be debated in many forums it is clear that  1  the current territorial status has not satisfied Puerto Rican political leaders  129  and  2  that despite the divergent views that Puerto Ricans have with respect to their preferred political status   all factions agree on the need to end the present undemocratic arrangement whereby Puerto Rico is subject to the laws of Congress but cannot vote in it   129   edit  Attempts to reintroduce a new UN vote The list of factors for determining when a colony has achieved a full measure of self government appears in Resolution 1541  XV  of the General Assembly of the United Nations  15 UN GAOR Supplement  No  16  at 29  UN Document A 4684  1960   130  131  The General Assembly did not apply its full list of criteria to Puerto Rico 131  132  for determining whether or not self governing status had been achieved  The UN s Committee on Non Self Governing States recently unanimously agreed 133  to ask the General Assembly to take up the issue of Puerto Rico  The Puerto Rico Senate in June  2007  approved a Concurrent Resolution urging the UN General Assembly to discuss Puerto Rico s case  Starting in 1971   Cuba introduced annual resolutions on the issue in the Decolonization Committee of the United Nations  The United States  however  has blocked General Assembly action and stopped cooperating with the Decolonization Committee  On August 23  1973  the United States vigorously opposed that members of Puerto Rico s independence movement be allowed to speak at the United Nations  134  The U S  position has not been  as some assert  that Puerto Rico is not a territory  Rather  the U S  position of record  based on General Assembly Resolution 748  is that the Decolonization Committee lacks jurisdiction  that the matter is one for the United States and Puerto Rico to resolve  and that Puerto Rico has not sought a new status   129  In 1972  the United Nations set a precedent when  after approving Puerto Rico s association with the United States in 1953 135  as sufficient evidence to remove PR from the list of Colonized Countries  the United Nations reopened the matter in 1972 and it is still under review  136  137  138   Failure  of the United States  to include independence as an option and harassment of  Puerto Rican  pro independence organizations were reasons for the United Nations  recent reconsideration of the status of Puerto Rico   138  Since 1972  the U N  Decolonization Committee has called for Puerto Rico s decolonization and for the United States to recognize the island s right to self determination and independence  Most recently  the Decolonization Committee called for the United Nations General Assembly to review the political status of Puerto Rico  a power reserved by the 1953 resolution  139  The United Nations still debates whether Puerto Rico is still a colony  140  In 1993  the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit stated that Congress may unilaterally repeal the Puerto Rican Constitution or the Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act and replace them with any rules or regulations of its choice  141  In a 1996 report on a Puerto Rico status political bill  the U S  House Committee on Resources stated   Puerto Rico s current status does not meet the criteria for any of the options for full self government under Resolution 1541   the three established forms of full self government being stated in the report as  1  national independence   2  free association based on separate sovereignty  or  3  full integration with another nation on the basis of equality   The report concluded that Puerto Rico      remains an unincorporated territory and does not have the status of  free association  with the United States as that status is defined under United States law or international practice   that the establishment of local self government with the consent of the people can be unilaterally revoked by the U S  Congress  and that U S  Congress can also withdraw the U S  citizenship of Puerto Rican residents of Puerto Rico at any time  for a legitimate Federal purpose  142  143  The application of the U S  Constitution applies partially to Puerto Rico by the Insular Cases   edit  Distinct national group  edit  Internationally Though politically associated with the United States  Puerto Rico is considered by many other nations to have its own distinct national identity  144  Internationally  it has been reported that  the Fourteenth Ministerial Conference of the Movement of Non aligned Nations   reaffirms that Puerto Rican people constitute a Latin American and Caribbean nation   145   edit  Amongst Puerto Ricans Although Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States classified as a commonwealth  it is considered by many Puerto Ricans a country in and of itself  146  147  148  149  In their classic work on American expansionism titled The Louisiana Purchase and American Expansion  1803 1898  Sanford Levinson and Bartholomew H  Sparrow also determined that  Most Puerto Ricans consider themselves a distinct national group    page 167   150  They also observed that both Americans and Puerto Ricans see themselves as separate cultures  and even separate nationalities   151  At the local level  it has been observed that  Puerto Ricans consider themselves a territorially distinct national unit  a nation defined by its cultural distinctiveness   152  In recent plebiscites Puerto Ricans have not expressed themselves in favor of a political status with the intention of becoming a sovereign state  but the idea that Puerto Rico is a separate social  political and cultural entity from the United States has been repeatedly expressed   edit  Position of US political parties Both major United States political parties  Democratic and Republican  have expressed their support for the U S  Citizens in Puerto Rico to exercise their right to self determination  Puerto Rico has been under U S  sovereignty for over a century and Puerto Ricans have been U S  citizens since 1917  but the island s ultimate status still has not been determined and its 3 9 million residents still do not have voting representation in their national government  The following are the appropriate section from the respective 2008  2004  and 2000 party platforms   edit  2008 Platforms  edit  Democratic Party 2008 Platform We believe that the people of Puerto Rico have the right to the political status of their choice  obtained through a fair  neutral  and democratic process of self determination  The White House and Congress will work with all groups in Puerto Rico to enable the question of Puerto Rico s status to be resolved during the next four years  We also believe that economic conditions in Puerto Rico call for effective and equitable programs to maximize job creation and financial investment  Furthermore  in order to provide fair assistance to those in greatest need  the U S  citizens in Puerto Rico should receive treatment under federal programs that is comparable to that of citizens in the States  We will phase out the cap on Medicaid funding and phase in equal participation in other federal health care assistance programs  Moreover  we will provide equitable treatment to the U S  citizens in Puerto Rico on programs providing refundable tax credits to working families  153   edit  Republican Party 2008 Platform We support the right of the United States citizens of Puerto Rico to be admitted to the Union as a fully sovereign state after they freely so determine  We recognize that Congress has the final authority to define the constitutionally valid options for Puerto Rico to achieve a permanent non territorial status with government by consent and full enfranchisement  As long as Puerto Rico is not a state  however  the will of its people regarding their political status should be ascertained by means of a general right of referendum or specific referenda sponsored by the U S  government  154   edit  2004 Platforms  edit  Democratic Party 2004 Platform We believe that four million disenfranchised American citizens residing in Puerto Rico have the right to the permanent and fully democratic status of their choice  The White House and Congress will clarify the realistic status options for Puerto Rico and enable Puerto Ricans to choose among them  155   edit  Republican Party 2004 Platform We support the right of the United States citizens of Puerto Rico to be admitted to the Union as a fully sovereign state after they freely so determine  We recognize that Congress has the final authority to define the Constitutionally valid options for Puerto Rico to achieve a permanent non territorial status with government by consent and full enfranchisement  As long as Puerto Rico is not a state  however  the will of its people regarding their political status should be ascertained by means of a general right of referendum or specific referenda sponsored by the United States government  156   edit  2000 Platforms  edit  Democratic Party 2000 Platform Puerto Rico has been under U S  sovereignty for over a century and Puerto Ricans have been U S  citizens since 1917  but the island s ultimate status still has not been determined and its 3 9 million residents still do not have voting representation in their national government  These disenfranchised citizens   who have contributed greatly to our country in war and peace   are entitled to the permanent and fully democratic status of their choice  Democrats will continue to work in the White House and Congress to clarify the options and enable them to choose and to obtain such a status from among all realistic options  157   edit  Republican Party 2000 Platform We support the right of the United States citizens of Puerto Rico to be admitted to the Union as a fully sovereign state after they freely so determine  We recognize that Congress has the final authority to define the constitutionally valid options for Puerto Rico to achieve a permanent status with the government by consent and full enfranchisement  As long as Puerto Rico is not a State  however  the will of its people regarding their political status should be ascertained by means of a general right of referendum or specific referenda sponsored by the United States government  158   edit  Controversies Elements of the U S  Puerto Rico relationship have been  and continue to be  matters of debate  Some contend that the current political status of Puerto Rico  perhaps with enhancements  remains a viable option  Others argue that commonwealth status is or should be only a temporary fix to be resolved in favor of other solutions considered permanent  non colonial  and non territorial  Some contend that if independence is achieved  the close relationship with the United States could be continued through compact negotiations with the federal government  One element apparently shared by all discussants is that the people of Puerto Rico seek to attain full  democratic representation  notably through voting rights on national legislation to which they are subject  159   edit  Decolonization by the UN and political empowerment Controversy exists surrounding the  real  political status of the Island  with some calling it a colony and others disagreeing  160  Some  especially independentistas and statehooders  claim Puerto Rico is still a colony despite the UN s removing Puerto Rico from its list of non self governing countries in 1953  Others  notably those who vote for the current commonwealth status option  argue that Puerto Rico is not a colony because the UN has not revoked its resolution after 55 years  Some authors have called Puerto Rico  the world s oldest colony   2001  161  and  one of the world s last colonies   2004   162  The former chief justice of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court  Jose Trias Monge  wrote a book on the political status of Puerto Rico whose title called Puerto Rico the oldest colony in the world  Puerto Rico  The Trials of the Oldest Colony in the World  163  Those who argue that Puerto Rico is still a colony insist that despite the UN resolution  Puerto Rico remains what some call a  post colonial colony   164  Defenders of this point of view  argue that Puerto Rico has less self determination now than it did before the U S  invaded the Island  it no longer has its own Puerto Rican citizenship as it did before  165  has no free maritime control as it did before  166  and has no representation in Congress as it did in the Spanish Cortes before in periods before the U S  invasion  Trias Monge argues that just prior to the U S  invasion  the Island enjoyed greater freedom and rights in certain areas than it does now  He then goes on to list six such greater rights  The six are  the insular parliament could legislate in matters of monetary policy  banking  import export duties  and public credit  Puerto Rico could negotiate its own commercial treaties  Puerto Ricans were Spanish citizens  equal in all respects to mainland Spanish citizens  the Spanish Constitution applied in Puerto Rico in the same manner as it applied in Spain proper  the Autonomic Charter of 1897  which governed Puerto Rico s relation with Spain  could not be changed except with Puerto Rico s consent  Yet those who claim Puerto Rico is not a colony will say that in its 8th session  the United Nations General Assembly recognized Puerto Rico s self government on November 27  1953  with Resolution 748  127  This side points out that such recognition removed Puerto Rico s classification as a non self governing territory  under article 73 e  of the Charter of the United Nations   They add that the Resolution has not been revoked by the United Nations even though Puerto Rico s political status is still debated in many international forums  167  Those who claim Puerto Rico is still a colony argue that Puerto Rico was vested with the commonwealth status by the US Congress to give the appearance of self government but that genuine decolonization never occurred  168  These supporters claim that the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1947 allowed the U S  to continue its colonial policy of Puerto Rico in a post colonial world  169  They see the passing of the Federal Relations Act of 1950  P L  600 170   as a gimmick by the US to maintain the colonial status of PR  The US Congress  however  carefully preserved its exclusive right to  unilaterally  alter the political status of Puerto Rico  Some saw the commonwealth as at best as temporary arrangement or at worst as a relic of the old colonial past   171  They also point to the fact that no change in the political status of Puerto Rico is possible unless authorized by the US Congress  171  as proof of the real current status   The deepest question   Rivera Ramos sustains   pertains to the source of rights and the source of authority to govern   In the case of  unincorporated  territories  the rights deemed to apply to their people  as well as those denied them  have their source in a constitution they have not approved nor have the power to amend   172  Those who support the view that Puerto Rico is no longer a colony but has changed into a different status  the commonwealth  argue that since the 1952 Constitution Congress has indicated that they will respect the wishes of the people of Puerto Rico  indicating that this is evidence of the validity of the current status as a non colony  Those claiming it is still a colony point to Congress legislating for Puerto Rico  and to bills where text such as those authorizing plebiscites in the Island  example  to conduct a second plebiscite between the options of  1  independence   2  national sovereignty in association with the United States  and  3  U S  statehood  The three options in the plebiscite also correspond to the options that the United Nations has identified as the options for decolonizing a territory    HR 2499  section 2 c    clearly include content to satisfy the United Nations demand for decolonizing a territory  In addition to judicial decisions like the 1993 United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit decision  this decision stated that Congress may unilaterally repeal the Puerto Rican Constitution or the Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act and replace them with any rules or regulations of its choice  141   edit  Granting of U S  citizenship and cultural identity Some claim that granting of US citizenship on Puerto Ricans on March 2  1917 was devised by the US in order to further reiterate its hold of Puerto Rico as a possession while others claim that it was a serious attempt to pave the way for statehood  Former chief of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court Jose Trias Monge insists that statehood was never intended for the island and that  unlike Alaska and Hawaii which Congress deemed incorporated territories and slated for annexation to the Union from the start  Puerto Rico was kept  unincorporated  specifically to avoid offering it statehood  173  Ayala and Bernabe add that  the purpose of the inclusion of U S  citizenship to Puerto Ricans in the Jones Act of 1917 was an attempt by Congress to block independence and perpetuate Puerto Rico in its colonial status 174  For the proponents of the citizenship clause in the Jones Act   the extension of citizenship did not constitute a promise of statehood but rather an attempt to exclude any consideration of independence   175  The preamble of the Commonwealth constitution approved by the people of Puerto Rico in 1952 in part reads     We consider as determining factors in our life our citizenship of the United States of America and our aspiration continually to enrich our democratic heritage in the individual and collective enjoyment of its rights and privileges  For the island s pro statehood movement  the concession of U S  citizenship has been seen  ever since  as the key that would eventually guarantee statehood for the island  as soon as the people of Puerto Rico demanded equality in citizenship  As former Puerto Rico House of Representatives Speaker Miguel Angel Garc a  M ndez would subsequently declare   For an American citizen  there cannot be another political goal other than equality with his or her fellow American citizens  To seek other solutions   to repudiate equality   is to repudiate the natural destiny of American citizenship   176  However  as early as 1912  President Taft had already said that there was no connection between the extension of citizenship to Puerto Ricans and the prospect of admission of Puerto Rico into the American Union   I believe the demand for citizenship is just  and amply earned by the sustained loyalty on the part of the inhabitants of the island  But it should be remembered that the demand must be entirely dissociated from any thought of statehood   177  President Taft s views in 1912 became the opinion of the United States Supreme Court when  in 1922 and as Chief Justice  Taft wrote the opinion on Balzac  the last of the so called Insular Cases  178  179  180  Thus  in the end  U S  citizenship has had multiple meanings for Puerto Ricans  For some it is a welcome link to the United States  regardless of the political status of the territory  For others  it has been nothing more than an imposed identity by an imperial power  Still others regard it as a useful asset that provides access to certain rights and tangible benefits and opportunities  And there are those that cherish it as a constituent element of their self image and identity  181   edit  Economic survival and self support Some contend that Puerto Rico cannot become a fully independent republic because there will be economic chaos and its citizens will die of hunger given that the land has no natural resources to sustain its population  citation needed  But others point to the example of countries that became independent  such as Ireland and Singapore and  though some containing less land and natural resources than Puerto Rico  today have economies far better than the Island  citation needed  According to educational scientists Francesco Cordasco and Eugene Bucchioni  in their 1973 work The Puerto Rican Experience  a Sociological Sourcebook  the belief that Puerto Rico cannot survive on its own results from teachings since grade school   Puerto Ricans here and in Puerto Rico are taught three things  Puerto Rico is small and the US is big  Puerto Rico is poor and the US is rich  Puerto Rico is weak and the US is strong   182  This theory of non sustainability is not new  it has been held by various groups at least since the 1930s  183  Commonwealth partisans argue that Puerto Rico cannot afford statehood  that post war economic growth in Puerto Rico was the result of special treatment via exemption from Federal corporate taxes  Statehooders respond that such tax exemptions primarily benefit the large industrialists and not the population as a whole since low income Puerto Ricans would not pay taxes  184  An example given by those who claim the Island will be able to support itself is Singapore  an island nation 14 times smaller than Puerto Rico with a drastically higher level of population density and fewer natural resources  which has surpassed the per capita income of larger nations  including the United States  185   In Puerto Rico  ever since you are a child  you are told that you live on a tiny island that has no natural resources  nothing  This is what they teach you in school  on TV  the media  and it s always negative  This perception is a byproduct of the island s political dependence on the U S  Politicians here will name it 20 000 different ways  but in any dictionary Puerto Rico is a colony  And there is this colonized mentality that everything from abroad is better   186  Juan Mari Br s stated   Only through a great unified movement looking beyond political and ideological differences  can the prevalent fears of hunger and persecution be overcome for the eventual liberation of Puerto Rico  breaking through domination by the greatest imperialist power of our age   187   edit  English as an official language Traditionally  the de facto and only official language in Puerto Rico had been Spanish  After the invasion by the United States in 1898  the Americans also made English the official language  188  189  190  In 1991 under the pro Commonwealth PPD administration of Rafael Hern ndez Col n Spanish was declared the only official language in the Island  Then  in 1993  under the pro statehood PNP administration of Pedro Rosello  the law was reversed  and English was again reinstated as an official language alongside Spanish  191  An official language controversy continues to exist to this day  In a 1993 survey by the Ateneo Puertorrique o  a leading cultural institution in Puerto Rico  93 percent of respondents indicated that they would not relinquish Spanish as their language if Puerto Rico ever became a state of the American Union and the United States required English as the only official language of the Island  192  193   edit  Suffrage and representation in the U S  Congress In a First Circuit Court of Appeals case Igart a v  United States  two of three members of the three judge panel that dismissed the appeal on procedural grounds suggested in separate opinions that  in an en banc reconsideration  the United States could be required  under the current status  to extend full voting representation to the United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico if  1  the en banc Court determines that  contrary to current Circuit precedent  the Constitution does not prohibit extending such rights  under another source of law    2  that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  ICCPR   which   at Article 25  states that   e very citizen shall have the right and the opportunity    t o vote and to be elected at genuine and periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage   is self executing  194  195   edit  Stateside Puerto Ricans and

the Pew Hispanic Center indicates that  as of 2007  4 1 million Puerto Ricans lived in the mainland versus 3 9 million living in the Island  196  Since the 1967 referendum  there have been demands that stateside Puerto Ricans be allowed to vote in these plebiscites on the political status of Puerto Rico  Since the 1990s  the role of stateside Puerto Ricans in advocating for Puerto Rico in Washington  D C   on issues such as the Navy s removal from Vieques and others has increased  especially given that there are three full voting members of the U S  Congress who are stateside Puerto Ricans  two from New York City and one from Chicago   in contrast to Puerto Rico s single Resident Commissioner in the U S  Congress with no vote  Between February 24 and March 6 in 2006  the National Institute for Latino Policy conducted an opinion survey over the Internet of a broad cross section of stateside Puerto Rican community leaders and activists across the United States  The survey had a total of 574 respondents  including 88 non Puerto Rican members of the Institute s national network of community leaders  The views of the 484 Puerto Ricans in the survey found broad support among them for the holding of a plebiscite on the future political status of Puerto Rico  While 73  were in favor of such a vote  they were split on the options to be voted upon  Those supporting the 2005 proposal made by the White House Task Force on Puerto Rico s Status that the vote be ultimately limited to the options of statehood versus independence made up 31  of the total respondents  A larger

because the cutoff point for income taxation is lower than that of the U S  IRS code  and because the per capita income in Puerto Rico is much lower than the average per capita income on the mainland  more Puerto Rico residents pay income taxes to the local taxation authority than if the IRS code were applied to the island  This occurs because  the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government has a wider
