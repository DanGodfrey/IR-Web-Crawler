Rutledge  and Ellsworth  1789 1801   the Court heard few cases  its first decision was West v  Barnes  1791   a case involving a procedural issue  4  The Court lacked a home of its own and had little prestige  5  a situation not helped by the highest profile case of the era  Chisholm v  Georgia  which was immediately repudiated by the Eleventh Amendment  The Court s power and prestige waxed during the Marshall Court  1801 1835   6  Under Marshall  the Court established the principle of judicial review  including specifying itself as the supreme expositor of the Constitution  Marbury v  Madison  7  8  and made several important constitutional rulings giving shape and substance to the balance of power between the federal government and the states  prominently  Martin v  Hunter s Lessee  McCulloch v  Maryland and Gibbons v  Ogden   9  10  11  12  The Marshall Court also ended the practice of each justice issuing his opinion seriatim  13  a remnant of British tradition  14  and instead issuing a single majority opinion  13  Also during Marshall s tenure  although beyond the Court s control  the impeachment and acquittal of Justice Samuel Chase in 1804 1805 helped cement the principle of judicial independence  15  16   edit  From Taney to Taft The Taney Court  1836 1864  made several important rulings  such as Sheldon v  Sill  which held that while Congress may not limit the subjects the Supreme Court may hear  it may limit the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts to prevent them from hearing cases dealing with certain subjects  17  Nevertheless  it is primarily remembered for its ruling in Dred Scott v  Sandford  18  which may have helped precipitate the Civil War  19  In the Reconstruction era  the Chase  Waite  and Fuller Courts  1864 1910  interpreted the new Civil War amendments to the Constitution 12  and developed the doctrine of substantive due process  Lochner v  New York  20 Adair v  United States   21  Under the White and Taft Courts  1910 1930   the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment had incorporated some guarantees of the Bill of Rights against the states  Gitlow v  New York   22  grappled with the new antitrust statutes  Standard Oil Co  of New Jersey v  United States   upheld the constitutionality of military conscription  Selective Draft Law Cases  23  and brought the substantive due process doctrine to its first apogee  Adkins v  Children s Hospital   24   edit  The New Deal era During the Hughes  Stone  and Vinson Courts  1930 1953   the Court gained its own accommodation in 1935 25  and changed its interpretation of the Constitution  giving a broader reading to the powers of the federal government to facilitate President Franklin Roosevelt s New Deal  most prominently West Coast Hotel Co  v  Parrish  Wickard v  Filburn  United States v  Darby and United States v  Butler   26   27  28  During World War II  the Court continued to favor government power  upholding the internment of Japanese citizens  Korematsu v  United States  and the mandatory pledge of allegiance  Minersville School District v  Gobitis   Nevertheless  Gobitis was soon repudiated  West Virginia State Board of Education v  Barnette   and the Steel Seizure Case restricted the pro government trend   edit  Warren and Burger Main article  Warren Court The Warren Court  1953 1969  dramatically expanded the force of Constitutional civil liberties  29  It held that segregation in public schools violates equal protection  Brown v  Board of Education  Bolling v  Sharpe and Green v  County School Bd   30  and that traditional legislative district boundaries violated the right to vote  Reynolds v  Sims   It created a general right to privacy  Griswold v  Connecticut   31  limited the role of religion in public school  most prominently Engel v  Vitale and Abington School District v  Schempp   32  33 incorporated most guarantees of the Bill of Rights against the States prominently Mapp v  Ohio  the exclusionary rule  and Gideon v  Wainwright  right to appointed counsel   34  35  and required that criminal suspects be apprised of all these rights by police  Miranda v  Arizona   36  At the same time  however  the Court limited defamation suits by public figures  New York Times v  Sullivan  and supplied the government with an unbroken run of antitrust victories  37  The Burger Court  1969 1986  expanded Griswold s right to privacy to strike down abortion laws  Roe v  Wade   38  but divided deeply on affirmative action  Regents of the University of California v  Bakke  39  and campaign finance regulation  Buckley v  Valeo   40  and dithered on the death penalty  ruling first that most applications were defective  Furman v  Georgia   41  then that the death penalty itself was not unconstitutional  Gregg v  Georgia   41  42  43   edit  Rehnquist and Roberts Main article  Roberts Court The Rehnquist Court  1986 2005  was noted for its revival of judicial enforcement of federalism  44  emphasizing the limits of the Constitution s affirmative grants of power  United States v  Lopez  and the force of its restrictions on those powers  Seminole Tribe v  Florida  City of Boerne v  Flores   45  46  47  48  49  It struck down single sex state schools as a violation of equal protection  United States v  Virginia   laws against sodomy as violations of substantive due process  Lawrence v  Texas   50  and the line item veto  Clinton v  New York   but upheld school vouchers  Zelman v  Simmons Harris  and reaffirmed Roe s restrictions on abortion laws  Planned Parenthood v  Casey   51  The Court s decision in Bush v  Gore  which ended the electoral recount during the presidential election of 2000  became controversial  52  The Roberts Court  2005 present  is regarded by some as more conservative than the Rehnquist Court  53  54  Some of its major rulings have concerned federal preemption  Wyeth v  Levine   civil procedure  Bell Iqbal   abortion  Gonzales v  Carhart   55  and the Bill of Rights  prominently Citizens United v  Federal Election Commission  First Amendment   56 Heller McDonald  Second Amendment   57  and Baze v  Rees  Eighth Amendment   58  59   edit  Composition  edit  Size of the Court Article III of the United States Constitution leaves it to Congress to fix the number of justices  The Judiciary Act of 1789 called for the appointment of six justices  and as the nation s boundaries grew  Congress added justices to correspond with the growing number of judicial circuits  seven in 1807  nine in 1837  and ten in 1863  In 1866  at the behest of Chief Justice Chase  Congress passed an act providing that the next three justices to retire would not be replaced  which would thin the bench to seven justices by attrition  Consequently  one seat was removed in 1866 and a second in 1867  In 1869  however  the Circuit Judges Act returned the number of justices to nine  60  where it has since remained  President Franklin D  Roosevelt attempted to expand the Court in 1937  His proposal envisioned appointment of one additional justice for each incumbent justice who reached the age of 70 years 6 months and refused retirement  up to a maximum bench of 15 justices  The proposal was ostensibly to ease the burden of the docket on elderly judges  but the actual purpose was widely understood as an effort to pack the Court with justices who would support Roosevelt s New Deal  61  The plan  usually called the  Court packing Plan   failed in Congress and proved a fiasco for Roosevelt  62  Nevertheless  the Court s balance began to shift within months when Justice van Devanter retired and was replaced by Senator Hugo Black  By the end of 1941  Roosevelt had appointed seven justices and elevated Harlan Fiske Stone to Chief Justice  63   edit  Appointment and confirmation Main article  Appointment and confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States The President of the United States appoints justices  by and with the advice and consent of the Senate   64  Most presidents nominate candidates who broadly share their ideological views  although a justice s decisions may end up being contrary to a president s expectations  Because the Constitution sets no qualifications for service as a justice  a president may nominate anyone to serve  subject to Senate confirmation  The Roberts Court  2010 Back row  left to right   Sonia Sotomayor  Stephen G  Breyer  Samuel A  Alito  and Elena Kagan  Front row  left to right   Clarence Thomas  Antonin Scalia  Chief Justice John G  Roberts  Anthony Kennedy  and Ruth Bader Ginsburg In modern times  the confirmation process has attracted considerable attention from the press and advocacy groups  which lobby senators to confirm or to reject a nominee depending on whether their track record aligns with the group s views  The Senate Judiciary Committee conducts hearings and votes on whether the nomination should go to the full Senate with a positive  negative or neutral report  The committee s practice of personally interviewing nominees is relatively recent  The first nominee to appear before the committee was Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925  who sought to quell concerns about his links to Wall Street  and the modern practice of questioning began with John Marshall Harlan II in 1955  65  Once the committee reports out the nomination  the full Senate considers it  Rejections are relatively uncommon  the Senate has explicitly rejected twelve Supreme Court nominees  most recently Robert Bork in 1987  Nevertheless  not every nominee has received a floor vote in the Senate  Although Senate rules do not necessarily allow a negative vote in committee to block a nomination  a nominee may be filibustered once debate has begun in the full Senate  No nomination for associate justice has ever been filibustered  but President Lyndon Johnson s nomination of sitting Associate Justice Abe Fortas to succeed Earl Warren as Chief Justice was successfully filibustered in 1968  A president may also withdraw a nominee s name before the actual confirmation vote occurs  typically because it is clear that the Senate will reject them  most recently Harriet Miers in 2006  Once the Senate confirms a nomination  the president must prepare and sign a commission  to which the Seal of the Department of Justice must be affixed  before the new justice can take office  66  The seniority of an associate justice is based on the commissioning date  not the confirmation or swearing in date  67  Before 1981  the approval process of justices was usually rapid  From the Truman through Nixon administrations  justices were typically approved within one month  From the Reagan administration to the present  however  the process has taken much longer  Some believe this is because Congress sees justices as playing a more political role than in the past  68   edit  Recess appointments When the Senate is in recess  a president may make temporary appointments to fill vacancies  Recess appointees hold office only until the end of the next Senate session  at most  less than two years   The Senate must confirm the nominee for them to continue serving  of the two chief justices and six associate justices who have received recess appointments  only Chief Justice John Rutledge was not subsequently confirmed  No president since Dwight Eisenhower has made a recess appointment to the Court  and the practice has become rare and controversial even in lower federal courts  69  In 1960  after Eisenhower had made three such appointments  the Senate passed a  sense of the Senate  resolution that recess appointments to the Court should only be made in  unusual circumstances   70  Such resolutions are not legally binding but are an expression of Congress s views in the hope of guiding executive action  70  71   edit  Tenure The Constitution provides that justices  shall hold their offices during good behavior   unless appointed during a Senate recess   The term  good behavior  is understood to mean justices may serve for the remainder of their lives  unless they are impeached and convicted by Congress  resign or retire  72  Only one justice has been impeached by the House of Representatives  Samuel Chase  March 1804   but he was acquitted in the Senate  March 1805   73  Moves to impeach sitting justices have occurred more recently  for example  William O  Douglas was the subject of hearings twice  once in 1953 and again in 1970   but they have not reached a vote in the House  No mechanism exists for removing a justice who is permanently incapacitated by illness or injury  both unable to resign and unable to resume service  74  Because justices have indefinite tenure  timing of vacancies can be unpredictable  Sometimes vacancies arise in quick succession  as in the early 1970s when Lewis Franklin Powell  Jr  and William Rehnquist were nominated to replace Hugo Black and John Marshall Harlan II  who retired within a week of each other  Sometimes a great length of time passes between nominations such as the eleven years between Stephen Breyer s nomination in 1994 and the nomination of John Roberts in 2005 to fill the seat of Sandra Day O Connor  though Roberts  nomination was withdrawn and resubmitted for the role of Chief Justice after Rehnquist died   Despite the variability  all but four presidents have been able to appoint at least one justice  William Henry Harrison died a month after taking office  though his successor  John Tyler  made an appointment during that presidential term  Zachary Taylor likewise died early in his term  although his successor  Millard Fillmore  also made a Supreme Court nomination before the end of that term  Andrew Johnson  who succeeded to the presidency after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln  was denied the opportunity to appoint a justice by a contraction in the size of the Court  Jimmy Carter is the only president who completed at least one full term in office without making a nomination to the Court during his presidency  Three presidents have appointed justices who collectively served more than 100 years  Franklin D  Roosevelt  Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln  75   edit

currently has six male and three female justices  One justice is African American  one is Latino  and two are Italian Americans  six justices are Roman Catholics  and three are Jewish  The average age is 66 years  3 months  and every current justice has an Ivy League background  76  In the 19th century  every justice was a Caucasian male  and concerns about diversity focused on geography  to represent all regions of the country  rather than ethnic  religious  or gender diversity  77 Thurgood Marshall became the first African American Justice in 1967  and Sandra Day O Connor became the first female Justice in 1981  O Connor  whose appointment fulfilled Ronald Reagan s campaign promise to place a woman on the Court  was later joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg  appointed by Bill Clinton in 1993  Marshall was succeeded by Clarence Thomas  and in 2009  Ginsburg was joined by Sonia Sotomayor  the first Latino justice  Most justices have been Protestants  including thirty five Episcopalians  nineteen Presbyterians  ten Unitarians  five Methodists  and three Baptists  78  79  The first Catholic justice was Roger Taney in 1836  and 1916 saw the appointment of the first Jewish justice  Louis Brandeis  In recent years this situation has reversed  upon the retirement of Justice Stevens  the Court is without a Protestant for the first time in its history  80   edit  Retired justices Main article  Retired justices of the Supreme Court of the United States There are three living retired justices  John Paul Stevens  Sandra Day O Connor  and David Souter  They may be designated to sit on panels of the United States Courts of Appeals  but never sit as members of the Supreme Court itself   edit  Seniority and seating Many of the internal operations of the Court are organized by the seniority of the justices  the Chief Justice is considered the most senior member of the Court  regardless of the length of his or her service  The Associate Justices are then ranked by the length of their service  During Court sessions  the justices sit according to seniority  with the Chief Justice in the center  and the Associate Justices on alternating sides  with the most senior Associate Justice on the Chief Justice s immediate right  and the most junior Associate Justice seated on the left farthest away from the Chief Justice  Therefore  the current court sits as follows from left to right when looking at the bench from the perspective of a lawyer arguing before the Court  Sotomayor  Breyer  Thomas  Scalia  most senior Associate Justice   Roberts  Chief Justice   Kennedy  Ginsburg  Alito  and Kagan  In the official yearly Court photograph  justices are arranged similarly  with the five most senior members sitting in the front row in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions  Thomas  Scalia  Roberts  Kennedy  Ginsburg   and the four most junior justices standing behind them  again in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions  Sotomayor  Breyer  Alito  Kagan   In the justices  private conferences  the current practice is for them to speak and vote in order of seniority from the Chief Justice first to the most junior Associate Justice last  The most junior Associate Justice in these conferences is tasked with any menial labor the justices may require as they convene alone  such as answering the door of their conference room  serving coffee  and transmitting the orders of the Court to the court s clerk  81  Justice Joseph Story served the longest as the junior justice  from February 3  1812  to September 1  1823  for a total of 4 228 days  Justice Stephen Breyer follows close behind  with 4 199 days when Samuel Alito joined the court on January 31  2006  82   edit  Salary For the years 2009 and 2010  associate justices have been paid  213 900 and the chief justice  223 500  83 Article III  Section 1 of the U S  Constitution prohibits Congress from reducing the pay for incumbent justices  Once a justice meets age and service requirements  the justice may retire and earn his or her final salary for life  plus cost of living increases   edit  Judicial leanings While justices do not represent or receive official endorsements from political parties  as is accepted practice in the legislative and executive branches  jurists are informally categorized in legal and political circles as being judicial conservatives  moderates  or liberals  Such leanings  however  refer to legal outlook rather than a political or legislative one  because Supreme Court justices are not members of the executive or legislative branches  As of the October 2010 term of the Court  the Court consists of five justices appointed by Republican Presidents  and four appointed by Democratic Presidents  It is popularly accepted that Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia  Thomas  and Alito comprise the Court s conservative wing  Justices Ginsburg and Breyer are generally thought of as the Court s liberal wing  after one term on the Court  Justice Sotomayor is also seen as a member of the liberal wing  voting much as her predecessor  Justice Souter  might have voted  84  85 John McGinnis  a law professor at Northwestern University School of Law  stated that Sotomayor  appears to be a typical member of the liberal wing   but noted that experts have said justices do not come into their own until they have served five years or so  pointing to Souter s first year as an example  85  however  McGinnis also noted that Sotomayor has a longer judicial track record than Souter did  According to statistics compiled by SCOTUSblog  during the 2009 term Sotomayor agreed most often with Ginsburg and Breyer  90  of the time in full  in part  or in judgment  second only to the 92  agreement between Scalia and Thomas   and disagreed most often with Scalia and Alito  31  of the time   86  Justice Anthony Kennedy  generally considered a conservative who  occasionally vote s  with the liberals   87  is often the swing vote that determines the outcome of close cases  88  In an article in SCOTUSblog  89 Tom Goldstein argues that the popular view of the Supreme Court as sharply divided along ideological lines and each side pushing an agenda at every turn is  in significant part a caricature designed to fit certain preconceptions   He points out that in the 2009 term  almost half the cases were decided unanimously  and only about 20  decided by a 5 to 4 vote  barely one in ten cases involved the narrow liberal conservative divide  fewer if the cases where Sotomayor recused herself are not included   He also points to several cases that seem to fly against the popular conception of the ideological lines of the Court  90  91  Goldstein argues that the large number of pro criminal defendant summary dismissals  usually cases where the justices decide that the lower courts significantly misapplied precedent and reverse the case without briefing or argument  are an illustration that the conservative justices have not been aggressively ideological  Likewise  Goldstein states that the critique that the liberal justices are more likely to invalidate acts of Congress  show inadequate deference to the political process  and be disrespectful of precedent  also lacks merit  Thomas has most often called for overruling prior precedent  even if long standing  that he views as having been wrongly decided  and during the 2009 term Scalia and Thomas voted most often to invalidate legislation  According to statistics compiled by SCOTUSblog  92  93  the Court decided 86 cases in the October 2010 term  including 75 signed opinions  5 summary reversals  where the Court reverses a lower court without arguments and without issuing an opinion on the case   four were decided with unsigned opinions  two cases affirmed by an equally divided Court  and two cases were dismissed as improvidently granted  Justice Kagan recused herself from 26 of those cases due to her prior role as United States Solicitor General  Of the 80 cases  38  about 48   the highest percentage since the October 2005 term  were decided unanimously  9 0 or 8 0   and only 16 decisions were made by a 5 4 vote  about 20   compared to 18  in the October 2009 term  and 29  in the October 2008 term   94  However  in the 5 4 decisions  the Court divided along the traditional ideological lines  with Ginsburg  Breyer  Sotomayor  and Kagan on one side  and Roberts  Scalia  Thomas  and Alito on the other  with Kennedy providing the  swing vote   in 14 of those 16 cases  87  of the time  the highest rate in the past 10 years   The conservative bloc  joined by Kennedy  formed the majority in 63  of the 5 4 decisions  the highest cohesion rate of that bloc in the Roberts court  92  95  96  97  98   edit  Politicization of the Court Clerks hired by each of the justices of the Supreme Court are often given considerable leeway in the opinions they draft   Supreme Court clerkship appeared to be a nonpartisan institution from the 1940s into the 1980s   according to a study published in 2009 by the law review of Vanderbilt University Law School  99  100   As law has moved closer to mere politics  political affiliations have naturally and predictably become proxies for the different political agendas that have been pressed in and through the courts   former federal court of appeals judge J  Michael Luttig said  99 David J  Garrow  professor of history at the University of Cambridge  stated that the Court had thus begun to mirror the political branches of government   We are getting a composition of the clerk workforce that is getting to be like the House of Representatives   Professor Garrow said   Each side is putting forward only ideological purists   99  According to the Vanderbilt Law Review study  this politicized hiring trend reinforces the impression that the Supreme Court is  a superlegislature responding to ideological arguments rather than a legal institution responding to concerns grounded in the rule of law   99   edit  Facilities The present U S  Supreme Court building seen from across 1st Street SE  From the 1860s until the 1930s  the court sat in the Old Senate Chamber of the U S  Capitol  Main article  United States Supreme Court Building The Supreme Court first met on February 1  1790  at the Merchants  Exchange Building in New York City  When Philadelphia became the capital  the Court met briefly in Independence Hall before settling in Old City Hall from 1791 until 1800  After the government moved to Washington  D C   the Court occupied various spaces in the United States Capitol building until 1935  when it moved into its own purpose built home  The four story building was designed by Cass Gilbert in a classical style sympathetic to the surrounding buildings of the Capitol and Library of Congress  and is clad in marble  The building includes the courtroom  justices  chambers  an extensive law library  various meeting spaces  and auxiliary services including a gymnasium  The Supreme Court building is within the ambit of the Architect of the Capitol  but maintains its own police force separate from the Capitol Police  101  Located across the street from the United States Capitol at One First Street NE and Maryland Avenue  102  103  the building is open to the public from 9 am to 4 30 pm weekdays but closed on weekends and holidays  102  Visitors may not tour the courtroom itself unaccompanied  There is a cafeteria  a gift shop  exhibits  and a half hour informational film  101  When the Court is not in session  lectures about the courtroom are held hourly from 9 30 am to 3 30 pm and reservations are not necessary  101  When the Court is in session the public may attend oral arguments  which are held twice each morning  and sometimes afternoons  on Mondays  Tuesdays  and Wednesdays in two week intervals from October through late April  with breaks during December and February  Visitors are seated on a first come first served basis  One estimate is there are about 250 seats available  104  The number of open seats varies from case to case  for important cases  some visitors arrive the day before and wait through the night  From mid May until the end of June  the court releases orders and opinions beginning at 10 am  and these 15 to 30 minute sessions are open to the public on a similar basis  101  Supreme Court Police are available to answer questions  102   edit  Jurisdiction Inscription on the wall of the Supreme Court Building from Marbury v  Madison  in which Chief Justice John Marshall outlined the concept of judicial review  Main article  Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States Section 2 of Article Three of the United States Constitution outlines the jurisdiction of the federal courts of the United States  The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases  in Law and Equity  arising under this Constitution  the Laws of the United States  and Treaties made  or which shall be made  under their Authority  to all Cases affecting Ambassadors  other public Ministers and Consuls  to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction  to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party  to Controversies between two or more States  between a State and Citizens of another State  between Citizens of different States  between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States  and between a State  or the Citizens thereof  and foreign States  Citizens or Subjects  The jurisdiction of the federal courts was further limited by the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution  which forbade federal courts from hearing cases  commenced or prosecuted against  a State  by Citizens of another State  or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State   However  states may waive this immunity  and Congress may abrogate the states  immunity in certain circumstances  see Sovereign immunity   In addition to constitutional constraints  Congress is authorized by Article III to regulate the court s appellate jurisdiction  for example  the federal courts may hear cases only if one or more of the following conditions are met  1  diversity of citizenship  meaning  the parties are residents of two different states or countries  including foreign states 105    plus a controversy of at least  75 000  106  2  If the case asks a federal question  107  3  If the United States federal government  including the Post Office 108   is a party in the case  109  110  Exercise of this power can become controversial  see jurisdiction stripping   For example  28 U S C    2241 e  1   as amended by the Detainee Treatment Act  provides that  No court  justice  or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the United States who has been determined by the United States to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination   The Constitution specifies that the Supreme Court may exercise original jurisdiction in cases affecting ambassadors and other diplomats  and in cases in which a state is a party  In all other cases  however  the Court has only appellate jurisdiction  It considers cases based on its original jurisdiction very rarely  almost all cases are brought to the Supreme Court on appeal  In practice  the only original jurisdiction cases heard by the Court are disputes between two or more states  The power of the Supreme Court to consider appeals from state courts  rather than just federal courts  was created by the Judiciary Act of 1789 and upheld early in the Court s history  by its rulings in Martin v  Hunter s Lessee  1816  and Cohens v  Virginia  1821   The Supreme Court is the only federal court that has jurisdiction over direct appeals from state court decisions  although there are several devices that permit so called  collateral review  of state cases  Since Article Three of the United States Constitution stipulates that federal courts may only entertain  cases  or  controversies   the Supreme Court avoids deciding cases that are moot and does not render advisory opinions  as the supreme courts of some states may do  For example  in DeFunis v  Odegaard  416 U S  312  1974   the Court dismissed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law school affirmative action policy because the plaintiff student had graduated since he began the lawsuit  and a decision from the Court on his claim would not be able to redress any injury he had suffered  The mootness exception is not absolute  If an issue is  capable of repetition yet evading review   the Court will address it even though the party before the Court would not himself be made whole by a favorable result  In Roe v  Wade  410 U S  113  1973   and other abortion cases  the Court addresses the merits of claims pressed by pregnant women seeking abortions even if they are no longer pregnant because it takes longer than the typical human gestation period to appeal a case through the lower courts to the Supreme Court   edit  Justices as Circuit Justices The United States is divided into thirteen circuit courts of appeals  each of which is assigned a  Circuit Justice  from the Supreme Court  Although this concept has been in continuous existence throughout the history of the republic  its meaning has changed through time  Under the Judiciary Act of 1789  each Justice was required to  ride circuit   or to travel within the assigned circuit and consider cases alongside local judges  This practice encountered opposition from many Justices  who cited the difficulty of travel  Moreover  several individuals opposed it because a Justice could not be expected to be impartial in an appeal if he had previously decided the same case while riding circuit  Circuit riding was abolished in 1891  Today  the duties of a  Circuit Justice  are generally limited to receiving and deciding requests for stays in cases coming from the circuit or circuits to which the Justice is assigned  and other clerical tasks such as addressing certain requests for extensions of time  A Circuit Justice may  but in practice almost never does  sit as a judge of that circuit  When he or she does so  a Circuit Justice has seniority over the Chief Judge of that circuit  The Chief Justice is traditionally assigned to the District of Columbia Circuit  the Federal Circuit and the Fourth Circuit  which includes Maryland and Virginia  the states surrounding the District of Columbia  Each Associate Justice is assigned to one or two judicial circuits  As of September 28  2010  the allotment of the justices among the circuits is  111  Circuit Justice District of Columbia Circuit Chief Justice Roberts First Circuit Justice Breyer Second Circuit Justice Ginsburg Third Circuit Justice Alito Fourth Circuit Chief Justice Roberts Fifth Circuit Justice Scalia Sixth Circuit Justice Kagan Seventh Circuit Justice Kagan Eighth Circuit Justice Alito Ninth Circuit Justice Kennedy Tenth Circuit Justice Sotomayor Eleventh Circuit Justice Thomas Federal Circuit Chief Justice Roberts Four of the current Justices are assigned to circuits on which they once sat as circuit judges  Chief Justice Roberts  D C  Circuit   Justice Breyer  First Circuit   Justice Alito  Third Circuit   and Justice Kennedy  Ninth Circuit    edit  Process Main article  Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States A term of the Supreme Court commences on the first Monday of each October  and continues until June or early July of the following year  Each term consists of alternating periods of approximately two weeks known as  sittings  and  recesses   Justices hear cases and deliver rulings during sittings  they discuss cases and write opinions during recesses   edit  Case selection Nearly all cases come before the court by way of petitions for writs of certiorari  commonly referred to as  cert   The Court may review any case in the federal courts of appeals  by writ of certiorari granted upon the petition of any party to any civil or criminal case   112  The Court may only review  final judgments rendered by the highest court of a state in which a decision could be had  if those judgments involve a question of federal statutory or constitutional law  113  The party that lost in the lower court is the petitioner and the party that prevailed is the respondent  All case names before the Court are styled petitioner v  respondent  regardless of which party initiated the lawsuit in the trial court  For example  criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the state and against an individual  as in State of Arizona v  Ernesto Miranda  If the defendant is convicted  and his conviction then is affirmed on appeal in the state supreme court  when he petitions for cert the name of the case becomes Miranda v  Arizona  There are situations where the Court has original jurisdiction  such as when two states have a dispute against each other  or when there is a dispute between the United States and a state  In such instances  a case is filed with the Supreme Court directly  Examples of such cases include United States v  Texas  a case to determine whether a parcel of land belonged to the United States or to Texas  and Virginia v  Tennessee  a case turning on whether an incorrectly drawn boundary between two states can be changed by a state court  and whether the setting of the correct boundary requires Congressional approval  Although it has not happened since 1794 in the case of Georgia v  Brailsford  parties in an action at law in which the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction may request that a jury determine issues of fact  114  Two other original jurisdiction cases involve colonial era borders and rights under navigable waters in New Jersey v  Delaware  and water rights between riparian states upstream of navigable waters in Kansas v  Colorado  The common shorthand name for cases is typically the first party  the petitioner   For example  Brown v  Board of Education is referred to simply as Brown  and Roe v  Wade as Roe  The exception to this rule is when the name of a state  or the United States  or some government entity  is the first listed party  In that instance  the name of the second party is the shorthand name  For example  Iowa v  Tovar is referred to simply as Tovar  and Gonzales v  Raich is referred to simply as Raich  because the first party  Alberto Gonzales  was sued in his official capacity as the United States Attorney General  A cert petition is voted on at a session of the court called a conference  A conference is a private meeting of the nine Justices by themselves  the public and the Justices  clerks are excluded  If four Justices vote to grant the petition  the case proceeds to the briefing stage  otherwise  the case ends  Except in death penalty cases and other cases in which the Court orders briefing from the respondent  the respondent may  but is not required to  file a response to the cert petition  The court grants a petition for cert only for  compelling reasons   spelled out in the court s Rule 10  Such reasons include  Resolving a conflict in the interpretation of a federal law or a provision of the federal Constitution Correcting an egregious departure from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings Resolving an important question of federal law  or to expressly review a decision of a lower court that conflicts directly with a previous decision of the Court  When a conflict of interpretations arises from differing interpretations of the same law or constitutional provision issued by different federal circuit courts of appeals  lawyers call this situation a  circuit split   If the court votes to deny a cert petition  as it does in the vast majority of such petitions that come before it  it does so typically without comment  A denial of a cert petition is not a judgment on the merits of a case  and the decision of the lower court stands as the final ruling in the case  To manage the high volume of cert petitions received by the Court each year  of the more than 7 000 petitions the Court receives each year  it will usually request briefing and hear oral argument in 100 or fewer   the Court employs an internal case management tool known as the  cert pool   Currently  all justices except for Justice Alito participate in the cert pool  115  116  117   edit  Oral argument When the Court grants a cert petition  the case is set for oral argument  At this point  both parties file briefs on the merits of the case  as distinct from reasons the parties may urge for granting or denying the cert petition  With the consent of the parties or approval of the Court  amici curiae  or  friends of the court   may also file briefs  The Court holds two week oral argument sessions each month from October through April  Each side has thirty minutes to present its argument  and during that time  the Justices may interrupt the advocate and ask questions  The petitioner gives the first presentation  and may reserve some time to rebut the respondent s arguments after the respondent has concluded  Amici curiae may also present oral argument on behalf of one party if that party agrees  The Court advises counsel to assume that the Justices are familiar with and have read the briefs filed in a case   edit  Decision At the conclusion of oral argument  the case is submitted for decision  Cases are decided by majority vote of the Justices  It is the Court s practice to issue decisions in all cases argued in a particular Term by the end of that Term  Within that Term  however  the Court is under no obligation to release a decision within any set time after oral argument  At the conclusion of oral argument  the Justices retire to another conference at which the preliminary votes are tallied  and the most senior Justice in the majority assigns the initial draft of the Court s opinion to a Justice on his or her side  Drafts of the Court s opinion  as well as any concurring or dissenting opinions  118  circulate among the Justices until the Court is prepared to announce the judgment in a particular case  It is possible that  through recusals or vacancies  the Court divides evenly on a case  If that occurs  then the decision of the court below is affirmed  but does not establish binding precedent  In effect  it results in a return to the status quo ante  For a case to be heard  there must be a quorum of at least six justices  119  If a quorum is not available to hear a case and a majority of qualified justices believes that the case cannot be heard and determined in the next term  then the judgment of the court below is affirmed as if the Court had been evenly divided  For cases brought directly to the Supreme Court by direct appeal from a United States District Court  the Chief Justice may order the case remanded to the appropriate U S  Court of Appeals for a final decision there  120  This has only occurred once in U S  history  in the case of United States v  Alcoa  121   edit  Published opinions The Court s opinions are published in three stages  First  a slip opinion is made available on the Court s web site and through other outlets  Next  several opinions are bound together in paperback form  called a preliminary print of United States Reports  the official series of books in which the final version of the Court s opinions appears  About a year after the preliminary prints are issued  a final bound volume of U S  Reports is issued  The individual volumes of U S  Reports are numbered so that users may cite this set of reports or a competing version published by another commercial legal publisher to allow those who read their pleadings and other briefs to find the cases quickly and easily  As of February 2010 ref   there are 548 volumes of U S  Reports  Lawyers use an abbreviated format to cite cases  in the form vvv U S  ppp  yyyy   The number before the  U S   refers to the volume number  and the number after the U S  refers to the page within that volume  The number in parentheses is the year in which the case was decided  For instance  the citation for Roe v  Wade is 410 U S  113  1973  and it means the case was decided in 1973 and appears on page 113 of volume 410 of U S  Reports  For hot from the press judgments  the volume and page numbers are replaced with         edit  Institutional powers and constraints The Constitution does not explicitly grant the Supreme Court the power of judicial review  nevertheless  the power of this Court to overturn laws and executive actions it deems unlawful or unconstitutional is a well established precedent  Many of the Founding Fathers accepted the notion of judicial review  in Federalist No  78  Alexander Hamilton wrote   A Constitution is  in fact  and must be regarded by the judges  as a fundamental law  It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning  as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body  If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two  that which has the superior obligation and validity ought  of course  to be preferred  or  in other words  the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute   The Supreme Court first established its power to declare laws unconstitutional in Marbury v  Madison  1803   consummating the system of checks and balances  This power allows judges to have the last word on allocation of authority among the three branches of the federal government  which grants them the ability to set bounds to their own authority  as well as to their immunity from outside checks and balances  The Supreme Court cannot directly enforce its rulings  instead  it relies on respect for the Constitution and for the law for adherence to its judgments  One notable instance of nonacquiescence came in 1832  when the state of Georgia ignored the Supreme Court s decision in Worcester v  Georgia  President Andrew Jackson  who sided with the Georgia courts  is supposed to have remarked   John Marshall has made his decision  now let him enforce it    122  however  this alleged quotation has been disputed  Some state governments in the South also resisted the desegregation of public schools after the 1954 judgment Brown v  Board of Education  More recently  many feared that President Nixon would refuse to comply with the Court s order in United States v  Nixon  1974  to surrender the Watergate tapes  Nixon  however  ultimately complied with the Supreme Court s ruling  Some argue that the Supreme Court is  the most separated and least checked of all branches of government   123  Justices are not required to stand for election by virtue of their tenure  during good behavior   and their pay may  not be diminished  while they hold their position  Section 1 of Article Three   Though subject to the process of impeachment  only one Justice has ever been impeached and no Supreme Court Justice has been removed from office  Supreme Court decisions have been purposefully overridden by constitutional amendment in only four instances  the Eleventh Amendment overturned Chisholm v  Georgia  1793   the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments in effect overturned Dred Scott v  Sandford  1857   the Sixteenth Amendment reversed Pollock v  Farmers  Loan and Trust Co   1895   and the Twenty sixth Amendment overturned some portions of Oregon v  Mitchell  1970   However  when the Court rules on matters involving the interpretation of laws rather than of the Constitution  simple legislative action can reverse the decisions  for example  in 2009 Congress passed the Lilly Ledbetter act  superseding the limitations given in Ledbetter v  Goodyear Tire  amp  Rubber Co  in 2007   Also  the Supreme Court is not immune from political and institutional restraints  lower federal courts and state courts sometimes resist doctrinal innovations  as do law enforcement officials  124  In addition  the other two branches can restrain the Court through other mechanisms  Congress can increase the number of justices  giving the President power to influence future decisions by appointments  as in Roosevelt s Court Packing Plan discussed above   Congress can pass legislation that restricts the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and other federal courts over certain topics and cases  this is suggested by language in Section 2 of Article Three  where the appellate jurisdiction is granted  with such Exceptions  and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make   The Court sanctioned such congressional action in the Reconstruction case ex parte McCardle  1869   though it rejected Congress  power to dictate how particular cases must be decided in United States v  Klein  1871   On the other hand  through its power of judicial review  the Supreme Court has defined the scope and nature of the powers and separation between the legislative and executive branches of the federal government  for example  in United States v  Curtiss Wright Export Corp   1936   Dames  amp  Moore v  Regan  1981   and notably in Goldwater v  Carter  1979    where it effectively gave the Presidency the power to terminate ratified treaties without the consent of Congress or the Senate   The Court s decisions can also impose limitations on the scope of Executive authority  as in Humphrey s Executor v  United States  1935   the Steel Seizure Case  1952   and United States v  Nixon  1974    edit  Criticism Some criticisms leveled at the Supreme Court are  Judicial activism  The Supreme Court has been criticized for not keeping within Constitutional bounds by engaging in judicial activism  rather than merely interpreting law and exercising judicial restraint  Claims of judicial activism are not confined to any particular ideology  125  An often cited example of conservative judicial activism is the 1905 decision in Lochner v  New York  which has been criticized by many prominent thinkers  including Robert Bork  Justice Antonin Scalia  and Chief Justice John Roberts  125  126  An often cited example of liberal judicial activism is Roe v  Wade  1973   which legalized abortion in part on the basis of the  right to privacy  expressed in the Fourteenth Amendment  a reasoning that some critics argued was circuitous  125  Legal scholars  127  128  justices  129  and presidential candidates 130  have criticized the Roe decision  The progressive Brown v  Board of Education decision has been criticized by conservatives such as Patrick Buchanan 131  and former presidential contender Barry Goldwater  132 Lincoln warned  referring to the Dred Scott decision  that if government policy became  irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court   the people will have ceased to be their own rulers   133  Former justice Thurgood Marshall justified judicial activism with these words   You do what you think is right and let the law catch up   134  During different historical periods  the Court has leaned in different directions  135  136  Critics from both sides complain that activist judges abandon the Constitution and substitute their own views instead  137  138  139  Critics include writers such as Andrew Napolitano  140 Phyllis Schlafly  141 Mark R  Levin  142 Mark I  Sutherland  143  and James MacGregor Burns  144  145  Past presidents from both parties have attacked judicial activism  including Franklin Roosevelt  Richard Nixon  and Ronald Reagan  146  147  Failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork wrote   What judges have wrought is a coup d  tat    slow moving and genteel  but a coup d  tat nonetheless   148  Senator Al Franken quipped that when politicians talk about judicial activism   their definition of an activist judge is one who votes differently than  the politician  would like   149  It has been argued that the Supreme Court is in some respects  certainly a legislative body   150  Federal versus state power  There has been debate throughout American history about the boundary between federal and state power  While Framers such as James Madison 151  and Alexander Hamilton 152  argued in the Federalist Papers that their then proposed Constitution would not infringe on the power of state governments  153  154  155  156  others argue that expansive federal power is good and consistent with the Framers  wishes  157  The Supreme Court has been criticized for giving the federal government too much power to interfere with state authority  One criticism is that it has allowed the federal government to misuse the Commerce Clause by upholding regulations and legislation which have little to do with interstate commerce  but that were enacted under the guise of regulating interstate commerce  and by voiding state legislation for allegedly interfering with interstate commerce  For example  the Commerce Clause was used to protect non commercial cave bugs within a state  158  Chief Justice John Marshall asserted Congress s power over interstate commerce was  complete in itself  may be exercised to its utmost extent  and acknowledges no limitations  other than are prescribed in the Constitution   159  Justice Alito said congressional authority under the Commerce Clause is  quite broad   160  Modern day theorist Robert B  Reich suggests debate over the Commerce Clause continues today  159  Advocates of states  rights such as constitutional scholar Kevin Gutzman have also criticized the Court  saying it has misused the Fourteenth Amendment to undermine state authority  Justice Brandeis  in arguing for allowing the states to operate without federal interference  suggested that states should be  laboratories  of democracy  161  One critic wrote  the great majority of Supreme Court rulings of unconstitutionality involve state  not federal  law   162  However  others see the Fourteenth Amendment as a positive force that extends  protection of those rights and guarantees to the state level   163  Judicial interference in political disputes  Some Court decisions have been criticized for injecting the Court into the political arena  and deciding questions that are the purview of the other two branches of government  The Bush v  Gore decision  in which the Supreme Court intervened in the 2000 presidential election and effectively chose George W  Bush over Al Gore  has been criticized extensively  particularly by liberals  164  165  166  167  168  169  Another example are Court decisions on apportionment and re districting  in Baker v  Carr  the court decided it could rule on apportionment questions  Justice Frankfurter in a  scathing dissent  argued against the court wading into so called  political questions   170  Failing to protect individual rights  Court decisions have been criticized for failing to protect individual rights  the Dred Scott  1857  decision upheld slavery  171 Plessy v Ferguson  1896  upheld segregation under the doctrine of separate but equal  172 Kelo v  City of New London  2005  was criticized by prominent politicians  including New Jersey governor Jon Corzine  as undermining property rights  173  174  A student criticized a 1988 ruling that allowed school officials  to block publication of a student article in the high school newspaper   175  Some critics suggest the 2009 bench with a conservative majority has  become increasingly hostile to voters  by siding with Indiana s voter identification laws which tend to  disenfranchise large numbers of people without driver s licenses  especially poor and minority voters   according to one report  176  Senator Al Franken criticized the Court for  eroding individual rights   149  However  others argue that the Court is too protective of some individual rights  particularly those of people accused of crimes or in detention  For example  Chief Justice Warren Burger was an outspoken critic of the exclusionary rule  and Justice Scalia criticized the Court s decision in Boumediene v  Bush for being too protective of the rights of Guantanamo detainees  on the grounds that habeas corpus was  limited  to sovereign territory  177  Supreme Court has too much power  This criticism is related to complaints about judicial activism  George Will wrote that the Court has an  increasingly central role in American governance   178  It was criticized for intervening in bankruptcy proceedings regarding ailing carmaker Chrysler Corporation in 2009  179  A reporter wrote that  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg s intervention in the Chrysler bankruptcy  left open the  possibility of further judicial review  but argued overall that the intervention was a proper use of Supreme Court power to check the executive branch  179  Warren E  Burger  before becoming Chief Justice  argued that since the Supreme Court has such  unreviewable power  it is likely to  self indulge itself  and unlikely to  engage in dispassionate analysis   180 Larry Sabato wrote  excessive authority has accrued to the federal courts  especially the Supreme Court   181  Courts are poor check on executive power  British constitutional scholar Adam Tomkins sees flaws in the American system of having courts  and specifically the Supreme Court  act as checks on the Executive and Legislative branches  he argues that because the courts must wait  sometimes for years  for cases to wend their way through the system  their ability to restrain the other two branches is severely weakened  182  183  Not choosing enough cases to review  Senator Arlen Specter said the Court should  decide more cases   149  On the other hand  although Justice Scalia acknowledged in a 2009 interview that the number of cases that the Court hears now is smaller today than when he first joined the Supreme Court  he also stated that he has not changed his standards for deciding whether to review a case  nor does he believe his colleagues have changed their standards  He attributed the high volume of cases in the late 1980s  at least in part  to an earlier flurry of new federal legislation that was making its way through the courts  184  Secretive proceedings  The Court has been criticized for keeping its deliberations hidden from public view  185  Its inner workings are difficult for reporters to cover  like a closed  cartel   only revealing itself through  public events and printed releases  with nothing about its inner workings   according to a review of Jeffrey Toobin s expose The Nine  Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court  168  The reviewer writes   few  reporters  dig deeply into court affairs  It all works very neatly  the only ones hurt are the American people  who know little about nine individuals with enormous power over their lives   168 Larry Sabato complains about the Court s  insularity   181  A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll conducted in 2010 found that 61  of American voters agreed that televising Court hearings would  be good for democracy   and 50  of voters stated they would watch Court proceedings if they were televised  186  187  In recent years  many justices have appeared on television  written books  and made public statements to journalists  184  188  In a 2009 interview on C SPAN  journalists Joan Biskupic  of USA Today  and Lyle Denniston  of SCOTUSblog  argued that the Court is a  very open  institution  with only the justices  private conferences being inaccessible to others  184  In October 2010  the Court began the practice of posting on its website recordings and transcripts of oral arguments on the Friday after they take place  Creating a culture of legal intimidation  Critic Philip K  Howard in The Death of Common Sense and Life Without Lawyers criticized the Court for promoting a culture in which  law is wielded as a weapon of intimidation rather than as an instrument of protection   189  It leads to  a nation paralyzed by fear  unwilling to assume responsibility  both overly reliant on authority and distrustful of it   189  Howard deplores a legal culture in which the  rights  of  whoever might disagree  have trumped common sense  190  Specifically  Howard criticized the Earl Warren court for too much  sympathy for the little man   191  He criticized the Conley v  Gibson decision for opening  the floodgates to abusive litigation   192  Lifetime tenure  Critic Larry Sabato wrote   The insularity of lifetime tenure  combined with the appointments of relatively young attorneys who give long service on the bench  produces senior judges representing the views of past generations better than views of the current day   181 Sanford Levinson has been critical of justices who stayed in office despite medical deterioration based on longevity  193 James MacGregor Burns stated lifelong tenure has  produced a critical time lag  with the Supreme Court institutionally almost always behind the times   144  Proposals to solve these problems include term
