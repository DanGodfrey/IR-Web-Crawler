less plausible  or at least non supernatural  content such as future settings  futuristic science and technology  space travel  aliens  and paranormal abilities  Exploring the consequences of scientific innovations is one purpose of science fiction  making it a  literature of ideas   1  Science fiction is largely based on writing rationally about alternative possible worlds or futures  2  It is similar to  but differs from fantasy in that  within the context of the story  its imaginary elements are largely possible within scientifically established or scientifically postulated laws of nature  though some elements in a story might still be pure imaginative speculation   The settings for science fiction are often contrary to known reality  but most science fiction relies on a considerable degree of suspension of disbelief  which is facilitated in the reader s mind by potential scientific explanations or solutions to various fictional elements  Science fiction elements include  A time setting in the future  in alternative timelines  or in a historical past that contradicts known facts of history or the archaeological record  A spatial setting or scenes in outer space  e g   spaceflight   on other worlds  or on subterranean earth  3  Characters that include aliens  mutants  androids  or humanoid robots  Technology that is futuristic  e g   ray guns  teleportation machines  humanoid computers   4  Scientific principles that are new or that contradict known laws of nature  for example time travel  wormholes  or faster than light travel  New and different political or social systems  e g  dystopia  post scarcity  or a post apocalyptic situation where organized society has collapsed   5  Paranormal abilities such as mind control  telepathy  telekinesis  and teleportation  Contents 1 Definitions 2 History 2 1 The term  sci fi  2 2 Innovation 3 Subgenres 3 1 Hard SF 3 2 Soft and social SF 3 3 Cyberpunk 3 4 Time travel 3 5 Alternate history

Definitions of science fiction  Science fiction is difficult to define  as it includes a wide range of subgenres and themes  Author and editor Damon Knight summed up the difficulty by stating that  science fiction is what we point to when we say it   6  a definition echoed by author Mark C  Glassy  who argues that the definition of science fiction is like the definition of pornography  you don t know what it is  but you know it when you see it  7 Vladimir Nabokov argued that if we were rigorous with our definitions  Shakespeare s play The Tempest would have to be termed science fiction  8  According to science fiction writer Robert A  Heinlein   a handy short definition of almost all science fiction might read  realistic speculation about possible future events  based solidly on adequate knowledge of the real world  past and present  and on a thorough understanding of the nature and significance of the scientific method   9 Rod Serling s definition is  fantasy is the impossible made probable  Science Fiction is the improbable made possible   10 Lester del Rey wrote   Even the devoted aficionado or fan has a hard time trying to explain what science fiction is   and that the reason for there not being a  full satisfactory definition  is that  there are no easily delineated limits to science fiction   11   edit  History For more details on this topic  see History of science fiction  As a means of understanding the world through speculation and storytelling  science fiction has antecedents back to mythology  though precursors to science fiction as literature can be seen in Lucian s True History in the 2nd century  12  13  14  15  16  some of the Arabian Nights tales  17  18 The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter in the 10th century  18 Ibn al Nafis  Theologus Autodidactus in the 13th century  19  and Jules Verne s A Journey to the Centre of the Earth and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea in the 19th century  A product of the budding Age of Reason and the development of modern science itself  Jonathan Swift s Gulliver s Travels 20  was one of the first true science fantasy works  together with Voltaire s Microm gas  1752  and Johannes Kepler s Somnium  1620 1630   21 Isaac Asimov and Carl Sagan consider the latter work the first science fiction story  22  23  It depicts a journey to the Moon and how the Earth s motion is seen from there  Another example is Ludvig Holberg s novel Nicolai Klimii iter subterraneum  1741   Translated to Danish by Hans Hagerup in 1742 as Niels Klims underjordiske Rejse    Eng  Niels Klim s Underground Travels   Brian Aldiss has argued that Mary Shelley s Frankenstein  1818  was the first work of science fiction  24  Following the 18th century development of the novel as a literary form  in the early 19th century  Mary Shelley s books Frankenstein and The Last Man helped define the form of the science fiction novel  25  later Edgar Allan Poe wrote a story about a flight to the moon  26  More examples appeared throughout the 19th century  H  G  Wells Then with the dawn of new technologies such as electricity  the telegraph  and new forms of powered transportation  writers like Jules Verne and H  G  Wells created a body of work that became popular across broad cross sections of society  27  Wells  The War of the Worlds describes an invasion of late Victorian England by Martians using tripod fighting machines equipped with advanced weaponry  It is a seminal depiction of an alien invasion of Earth  In the late 19th century  the term  scientific romance  was used in Britain to describe much of this fiction  This produced additional offshoots  such as the 1884 novella Flatland  A Romance of Many Dimensions by Edwin Abbott Abbott  The term would continue to be used into the early 20th century for writers such as Olaf Stapledon  Jules Verne In the early 20th century  pulp magazines helped develop a new generation of mainly American SF writers  influenced by Hugo Gernsback  the founder of Amazing Stories magazine  28  In 1912 Edgar Rice Burroughs published A Princess of Mars  the first of his three decade long series of Barsoom novels  situated on Mars and featuring John Carter as the hero  The 1928 publication of Philip Nolan s original Buck Rogers story  Armageddon 2419  in Amazing Stories was a landmark event  This story led to comic strips featuring Buck Rogers  1929   Brick Bradford  1933   and Flash Gordon  1934   The comic strips and derivative movie serials greatly popularized science fiction  In the late 1930s  John W  Campbell became editor of Astounding Science Fiction  and a critical mass of new writers emerged in New York City in a group called the Futurians  including Isaac Asimov  Damon Knight  Donald A  Wollheim  Frederik Pohl  James Blish  Judith Merril  and others  29  Other important writers during this period included E E   Doc  Smith  Robert A  Heinlein  Arthur C  Clarke  Olaf Stapledon  A  E  van Vogt and Stanis aw Lem  Campbell s tenure at Astounding is considered to be the beginning of the Golden Age of science fiction  characterized by hard SF stories celebrating scientific achievement and progress  28  This lasted until postwar technological advances  new magazines like Galaxy under Pohl as editor  and a new generation of writers began writing stories outside the Campbell mode  In the 1950s  the Beat generation included speculative writers like William S  Burroughs  In the 1960s and early 1970s  writers like Frank Herbert  Samuel R  Delany  Roger Zelazny  and Harlan Ellison explored new trends  ideas  and writing styles  while a group of writers  mainly in Britain  became known as the New Wave for their embrace of a high degree of experimentation  both in form and in content  and a highbrow and self consciously  literary  or artistic sensibility  20  In the 1970s  writers like Larry Niven and Poul Anderson began to redefine hard SF  30 Ursula K  Le Guin and others pioneered soft science fiction  31  In the 1980s  cyberpunk authors like William Gibson turned away from the optimism and support for progress of traditional science fiction  32 The Star Wars franchise helped spark a new interest in space opera  33  focusing more on story and character than on scientific accuracy  C  J  Cherryh s detailed explorations of alien life and complex scientific challenges influenced a generation of writers  34  Emerging themes in the 1990s included environmental issues  the implications of the global Internet and the expanding information universe  questions about biotechnology and nanotechnology  as well as a post Cold War interest in post scarcity societies  Neal Stephenson s The Diamond Age comprehensively explores these themes  Lois McMaster Bujold s Vorkosigan novels brought the character driven story back into prominence  35  The television series Star Trek  The Next Generation  1987  began a torrent of new SF shows  including three further Star Trek spin off shows and Babylon 5  36  37  Concern about the rapid pace of technological change crystallized around the concept of the technological singularity  popularized by Vernor Vinge s novel Marooned in Realtime and then taken up by other authors  citation needed   edit  The term  sci fi  Forrest J Ackerman used the term sci fi  analogous to the then trendy  hi fi   at UCLA in 1954  38  As science fiction entered popular culture  writers and fans active in the field came to associate the term with low budget  low tech  B movies  and with low quality pulp science fiction  39  40  41  By the 1970s  critics within the field such as Terry Carr and Damon Knight were using sci fi to distinguish hack work from serious science fiction  42  and around 1978  Susan Wood and others introduced the pronunciation  skiffy   Peter Nicholls writes that  SF   or  sf   is  the preferred abbreviation within the community of sf writers and readers   43 David Langford s monthly fanzine Ansible includes a regular section  As Others See Us  which offers numerous examples of  sci fi  being used in a pejorative sense by people outside the genre  44  The abbreviation SF  or sf  is commonly used instead of  sci fi    edit  Innovation While SF has provided criticism of developing and future technologies  it also produces innovation and new technology  The discussion of this topic has occurred more in literary and sociological than in scientific forums  Cinema and media theorist Vivian Sobchack examines the dialogue between science fiction film and the technological imagination  Technology impacts artists and how they portray their fictionalized subjects  but the fictional world gives back to science by broadening imagination  While more prevalent in the beginning years of science fiction with writers like Arthur C  Clarke  new authors still find ways to make the currently impossible technologies seem closer to being realized  45   edit  Subgenres For more details on this topic  see Science fiction genre  A categorization of science fiction into various subgenres can be problematic  because these subcategories are not simple pigeonholes  Some works may overlap two or more commonly defined genres  whereas others are beyond the generic boundaries  either outside or between categories  Moreover  the categories and genres used by mass markets and literary criticism differ considerably  One example that straddles science fiction subgenres is Elizabeth Moon s Vatta s War series  which has been described by many as military science fiction but also has elements of space opera   edit  Hard SF Main article  Hard science fiction Hard science fiction  or  hard SF   is characterized by rigorous attention to accurate detail in quantitative sciences  especially physics  astrophysics  and chemistry  or on accurately depicting worlds that more advanced technology may make possible  Many accurate predictions of the future come from the hard science fiction subgenre  but numerous inaccurate predictions have emerged as well  citation needed  Some hard SF authors have distinguished themselves as working scientists  including Gregory Benford  Geoffrey A  Landis and David Brin  46  47  while mathematician authors include Rudy Rucker and Vernor Vinge  Other noteworthy hard SF authors include Isaac Asimov  Arthur C  Clarke  Hal Clement  Greg Bear  Larry Niven  Robert J  Sawyer  Stephen Baxter  Alastair Reynolds  Charles Sheffield  Ben Bova  Kim Stanley Robinson and Greg Egan   edit  Soft and social SF Main article  Soft science fiction The description  soft  science fiction may describe works based on social sciences such as psychology  economics  political science  sociology  and anthropology  Noteworthy writers in this category include Ursula K  Le Guin and Philip K  Dick  28  48  The term can describe stories focused primarily on character and emotion  SFWA Grand Master Ray Bradbury is an acknowledged master of this art  49  The Soviet Union produced a quantity of social science fiction  including works by the Strugatsky brothers  Kir Bulychov  Yevgeny Zamyatin and Ivan Yefremov  50  51  Some writers blur the boundary between hard and soft science fiction  52  Related to Social SF and Soft SF are the speculative fiction branches of utopian or dystopian stories  George Orwell s Nineteen Eighty Four  Aldous Huxley s Brave New World and Margaret Atwood s The Handmaid s Tale  are examples  Satirical novels with fantastic settings such as Gulliver s Travels by Jonathan Swift may be considered speculative fiction   edit  Cyberpunk Main article  Cyberpunk The cyberpunk genre emerged in the early 1980s  combining cybernetics and punk  53  the term was coined by author Bruce Bethke for his 1980 short story  Cyberpunk   54  The time frame is usually near future and the settings are often dystopian in nature and characterized by misery  Common themes in cyberpunk include advances in information technology and especially the Internet  visually abstracted as cyberspace  artificial intelligence and prosthetics and post democratic societal control where corporations have more influence than governments  Nihilism  post modernism  and film noir techniques are common elements  and the protagonists may be disaffected or reluctant anti heroes  Noteworthy authors in this genre are William Gibson  Bruce Sterling  Neal Stephenson  and Pat Cadigan  James O Ehley has called the 1982 film Blade Runner a definitive example of the cyberpunk visual style  55   edit  Time travel Time travel stories have antecedents in the 18th and 19th centuries  The first major time travel novel was Mark Twain s A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur s Court  The most famous is H  G  Wells s 1895 novel The Time Machine  which uses a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposefully and selectively  while Twain s time traveler is struck in the head  The term  time machine   coined by Wells  is now universally used to refer to such a vehicle  Stories of this type are complicated by logical problems such as the grandfather paradox  56  Time travel continues to be a popular subject in modern science fiction  in print  movies  and television such as the BBC television series Doctor Who   edit  Alternate history Main article  Alternate history Alternate  or alternative  history stories are based on the premise that historical events might have turned out differently  These stories may use time travel to change the past  or may simply set a story in a universe with a different history from our own  Classics in the genre include Bring the Jubilee by Ward Moore  in which the South wins the American Civil War  and The Man in the High Castle by Philip K  Dick  in which Germany and Japan win World War II  The Sidewise Award acknowledges the best works in this subgenre  the name is taken from Murray Leinster s 1934 story  Sidewise in Time   Harry Turtledove is one of the most prominent authors in the subgenre and is sometimes called the  master of alternate history   57  58   edit  Military SF Main article  Military science fiction Military science fiction is set in the context of conflict between national  interplanetary  or interstellar armed forces  the primary viewpoint characters are usually soldiers  Stories include detail about military technology  procedure  ritual  and history  military stories may use parallels with historical conflicts  Heinlein s Starship Troopers is an early example  along with the Dorsai novels of Gordon Dickson  Joe Haldeman s The Forever War is a critique of the genre  a Vietnam era response to the World War II style stories of earlier authors  59  Prominent military SF authors include John Ringo  David Drake  David Weber  and S  M  Stirling  The publishing company Baen Books is known for cultivating military science fiction authors  60   edit  Superhuman Superhuman stories deal with the emergence of humans who have abilities beyond the norm  This can stem either from natural causes such as in Olaf Stapledon s novel Odd John  and Theodore Sturgeon s More Than Human  or be the result of intentional augmentation such as in A  E  van Vogt s novel Slan  These stories usually focus on the alienation that these beings feel as well as society s reaction to them  These stories have played a role in the real life discussion of human enhancement  Frederik Pohl s Man Plus also belongs to this category   edit  Apocalyptic Main article  Apocalyptic fiction Apocalyptic fiction is concerned with the end of civilization through war  On the Beach   pandemic  The Last Man   astronomic impact  When Worlds Collide   ecological disaster  The Wind from Nowhere   or some other general disaster or with a world or civilization after such a disaster  Typical of the genre are George R  Stewart s novel Earth Abides and Pat Frank s novel Alas  Babylon  Apocalyptic fiction generally concerns the disaster itself and the direct aftermath  while post apocalyptic can deal with anything from the near aftermath  as in Cormac McCarthy s The Road  to 375 years in the future  as in By The Waters of Babylon  to hundreds or thousands of years in the future  as in Russell Hoban s novel Riddley Walker and Walter M  Miller  Jr  s A Canticle for Leibowitz   edit  Space opera Main article  Space opera Space opera is adventure science fiction set in outer space or on distant planets  where the emphasis is on action rather than either science or characterization  The conflict is heroic  and typically on a large scale  Space opera is sometimes used pejoratively  to describe improbable plots  absurd science  and cardboard characters  But it is also used nostalgically  and modern space opera may be an attempt to recapture the sense of wonder of the golden age of science fiction  The pioneer of this subgenre is generally recognized to be Edward E   Doc  Smith  with his Skylark and Lensman series  The Star Trek television series franchise is often described as space opera that encourages this sense of wonder  in that most of the scripts are generally about peaceful space exploration and examinations of cultural differences rather than about conflict between civilizations  Alastair Reynolds s Revelation Space series  Peter F  Hamilton s Void  Night s Dawn and Pandora s Star series  and Vernor Vinge s A Fire Upon the Deep and A Deepness in the Sky are newer examples of this genre   edit  Space Western Main article  Space western Space Western could be considered a sub genre of space opera that transposes themes of the American Western books and film to a backdrop of futuristic space frontiers  These stories typically involve  frontier  colony worlds  colonies that have only recently been terraformed and or settled  serving as stand ins for the backdrop of lawlessness and economic expansion that were predominant in the American west  Examples include the Sean Connery film Outland  the Firefly television series  and the film sequel Serenity by Joss Whedon  as well as the manga and anime series Trigun  Outlaw Star  and Cowboy Bebop   edit  Other sub genres This section requires expansion  Anthropological science fiction is a sub genre that absorbs and discusses anthropology and the study of human kind  Examples include Hominids by Robert J  Sawyer  and Neanderthal by John Darnton  Biopunk focuses on biotechnology and subversives  Comic science fiction is a sub genre that exploits the genre s conventions for comic effect  Feminist science fiction poses questions about social issues such as how society constructs gender roles  the role reproduction plays in defining gender and the unequal political and personal power of men and women  Some of the most notable feminist science fiction works have illustrated these themes using utopias to explore a society in which gender differences or gender power imbalances do not exist  or dystopias to explore worlds in which gender inequalities are intensified  thus asserting a need for feminist work to continue  61 Joanna Russ s work  and some of Ursula Le Guin s work can be thus categorised  Science fiction poetry is an overlooked and under discussed sub category of science fiction  As Seo Young Chu remarks in her 2011 book Do Metaphors Dream of Literal Sleep  A Science Fictional Theory of Representation  science fiction is not often  enough  thought of as a genre related to lyric poetry  But as Chu points out  there are plenty of examples of science fiction poetry and verse by writers including Diane Ackerman  Emily Dickinson  Suzette Haden Elgin  who founded the Science Fiction Poetry Association and authored The Science Fiction Poetry Handbook   Ruth Fainlight  Robert Frazier  Cathy Park Hong  Andrew Joron  and Frederick Turner  among many others  Chu also points out that lyricism is an overlooked yet overwhelming presence in science fiction novels  stories  and films  62  Steampunk is based on the idea of futuristic technology existing in the past  usually the 19th century  and often set in Victorian era England but with prominent elements of either science fiction or fantasy  such as fictional technological inventions like those found in the works of H  G  Wells and Jules Verne  or real technological developments like the computer occurring at an earlier date  Popular examples include The Difference Engine by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling  as well as the Girl Genius series by Phil and Kaja Foglio  although seeds of the genre may be seen in certain works of Michael Moorcock  Philip Jose Farmer and Steve Stiles  and in such games as Space 1889 and Marcus Rowland s Forgotten Futures  Machines are most often powered by steam in this genre  hence the name    edit  Related genres  edit  Speculative fiction  fantasy  and horror For more details on this topic  see Speculative fiction  The broader category of speculative fiction 63  includes science fiction  fantasy  alternate histories  which may have no particular scientific or futuristic component   and even literary stories that contain fantastic elements  such as the work of Jorge Luis Borges or John Barth  For some editors  magic realism is considered to be within the broad definition of speculative fiction  64   edit  Fantasy Main article  Fantasy Fantasy is closely associated with science fiction  and many writers have worked in both genres  while writers such as Anne McCaffrey  Ursula K  LeGuin  and Marion Zimmer Bradley have written works that appear to blur the boundary between the two related genres  65  The authors  professional organization is called the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America  SFWA   66  SF conventions routinely have programming on fantasy topics  67  68  69  and fantasy authors such as J  K  Rowling have won the highest honor within the science fiction field  the Hugo Award  70  In general  science fiction differs from fantasy in that the former concerns things that might someday be possible or that at least embody the pretense of realism  Supernaturalism  usually absent in science fiction  is the distinctive characteristic of fantasy literature  A dictionary definition referring to fantasy literature is  fiction characterized by highly fanciful or supernatural elements    71  Examples of fantasy supernaturalism include magic  spells  harm to opponents   magical places  Narnia  Oz  Middle Earth  Hogwarts   supernatural creatures  witches  vampires  orcs  trolls   supernatural transportation  flying broomsticks  ruby slippers  windows between worlds   and shapeshifting  beast into man  man into wolf or bear  lion into sheep   Such things are basic themes in fantasy  72  Literary critic Fredric Jameson has characterized the difference between the two genres by describing science fiction as turning  on a formal framework determined by concepts of the mode of production rather than those of religion    that is  science fiction texts are bound by an inner logic based more on historical materialism than on magic or the forces of good and evil  73  Some narratives are described as being essentially science fiction but  with fantasy elements   The term  science fantasy  is sometimes used to describe such material  74  Frankenstein  1931  film poster  edit  Horror fiction Main article  Horror fiction Horror fiction is the literature of the unnatural and supernatural  with the aim of unsettling or frightening the reader  sometimes with graphic violence  Historically it has also been known as weird fiction  Although horror is not per se a branch of science fiction  many works of horror literature incorporates science fictional elements  One of the defining classical works of horror  Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein  is the first fully realized work of science fiction  where the manufacture of the monster is given a rigorous science fictional grounding  The works of Edgar Allan Poe also helped define both the science fiction and the horror genres  75  Today horror is one of the most popular categories of films  76  Horror is often mistakenly categorized as science fiction at the point of distribution by libraries  video rental outlets  etc  For example  Syfy  distributed via cable and satellite television in the United States  currently devotes most its air time to horror films with very few science fiction titles  citation needed   edit  Mystery fiction Main article  Mystery fiction Works in which science and technology are a dominant theme  but based on current reality  may be considered mainstream fiction  Much of the thriller genre would be included  such as the novels of Tom Clancy or Michael Crichton  or the James Bond films  77 Modernist works from writers like Kurt Vonnegut  Philip K  Dick  and Stanis aw Lem have focused on speculative or existential perspectives on contemporary reality and are on the borderline between SF and the mainstream  78  According to Robert J  Sawyer   Science fiction and mystery have a great deal in common  Both prize the intellectual process of puzzle solving  and both require stories to be plausible and hinge on the way things really do work   79 Isaac Asimov  Walter Mosley  and other writers incorporate mystery elements in their science fiction  and vice versa  citation needed   edit  Superhero fiction Main article  Superhero fiction Superhero fiction is a genre characterized by beings with much higher than usual capability and prowess  generally with a desire or need to help the citizens of their chosen country or world by using his or her powers to defeat natural or superpowered threats  Many superhero fiction characters involve themselves  either intentionally or accidentally  with science fiction and fact  including advanced technologies  alien worlds  time travel  and interdimensional travel  but the standards of scientific plausibility are lower than with actual science fiction  Authors of this genre include Stan Lee  co creator of Spider Man  the Fantastic Four  the X Men  and the Hulk   Marv Wolfman  the creator of Blade for Marvel Comics  and The New Teen Titans for DC Comics  Dean Wesley Smith  Smallville  Spider Man  and X Men novels  and Superman writers Roger Stern and Elliot S  Maggin   edit  Fandom and community For more details on this topic  see Science fiction fandom  Science fiction fandom is the  community of the literature of ideas    the culture in which new ideas emerge and grow before being released into society at large   80  Members of this community   fans   are in contact with each other at conventions or clubs  through print or online fanzines  or on the Internet using web sites  mailing lists  and other resources  SF fandom emerged from the letters column in Amazing Stories magazine  Soon fans began writing letters to each other  and then grouping their comments together in informal publications that became known as fanzines  81  Once they were in regular contact  fans wanted to meet each other  and they organized local clubs  In the 1930s  the first science fiction conventions gathered fans from a wider area  82  Conventions  clubs  and fanzines were the dominant form of fan activity  or  fanac   for decades  until the Internet facilitated communication among a much larger population of interested people   edit  Awards For more details on this topic  see List of science fiction awards  Among the most respected awards for science fiction are the Hugo Award  presented by the World Science Fiction Society at Worldcon  the Nebula Award  presented by SFWA and voted on by the community of authors  and the John W  Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel and Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award for short fiction  One notable award for science fiction films is the Saturn Award  It is presented annually by The Academy of Science Fiction  Fantasy  and Horror Films  There are national awards  like Canada s Aurora Award  regional awards  like the Endeavour Award presented at Orycon for works from the Pacific Northwest  special interest or subgenre awards like the Chesley Award for art or the World Fantasy Award for fantasy  Magazines may organize reader polls  notably the Locus Award   edit  Conventions  clubs  and organizations For more details on this topic  see Science fiction conventions  Pamela Dean reading at Minicon Conventions  in fandom  shortened as  cons    are held in cities around the world  catering to a local  regional  national  or international membership  General interest conventions cover all aspects of science fiction  while others focus on a particular interest like media fandom  filking  etc  Most are organized by volunteers in non profit groups  though most media oriented events are organized by commercial promoters  The convention s activities are called the  program   which may include panel discussions  readings  autograph sessions  costume masquerades  and other events  Activities that occur throughout the convention are not part of the program  these commonly include a dealer s room  art show  and hospitality lounge  or  con suites    83  Conventions may host award ceremonies  Worldcons present the Hugo Awards each year  SF societies  referred to as  clubs  except in formal contexts  form a year round base of activities for science fiction fans  They may be associated with an ongoing science fiction convention  or have regular club meetings  or both  Most groups meet in libraries  schools and universities  community centers  pubs or restaurants  or the homes of individual members  Long established groups like the New England Science Fiction Association and the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society have clubhouses for meetings and storage of convention supplies and research materials  84  The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America  SFWA  was founded by Damon Knight in 1965 as a non profit organization to serve the community of professional science fiction authors  66  24 years after his essay  Unite or Fie   had led to the organization of the National Fantasy Fan Federation  Fandom has helped incubate related groups  including media fandom  85  the Society for Creative Anachronism  86 gaming  87 filking  and furry fandom  88   edit  Fanzines and online fandom For more details on this topic  see Science fiction fanzine  The first science fiction fanzine  The Comet  was published in 1930  89  Fanzine printing methods have changed over the decades  from the hectograph  the mimeograph  and the ditto machine  to modern photocopying  Distribution volumes rarely justify the cost of commercial printing  Modern fanzines are printed on computer printers or at local copy shops  or they may only be sent as email  The best known fanzine  or   zine   today is Ansible  edited by David Langford  winner of numerous Hugo awards  Other fanzines to win awards in recent years include File 770  Mimosa  and Plokta  90  Artists working for fanzines have risen to prominence in the field  including Brad W  Foster  Teddy Harvia  and Joe Mayhew  the Hugos include a category for Best Fan Artists  90  The earliest organized fandom online was the SF Lovers community  originally a mailing list in the late 1970s with a text archive file that was updated regularly  91  In the 1980s  Usenet groups greatly expanded the circle of fans online  In the 1990s  the development of the World Wide Web exploded the community of online fandom by orders of magnitude  with thousands and then literally millions of web sites devoted to science fiction and related genres for all media  84  Most such sites are small  ephemeral  and or very narrowly focused  though sites like SF Site offer a broad range of references and reviews about science fiction   edit  Fan fiction For more details on this topic  see Fan fiction  Fan fiction  known to aficionados as  fanfic   is non commercial fiction created by fans in the setting of an established book  film  video game  or television series  92  This modern meaning of the term should not be confused with the traditional  pre 1970s  meaning of  fan fiction  within the community of fandom  where the term meant original or parody fiction written by fans and published in fanzines  often with members of fandom as characters therein   faan fiction    Examples of this would include the Goon Defective Agency stories  written starting in 1956 by Irish fan John Berry and published in his and Arthur Thomson s fanzine Retribution  In the last few years  sites have appeared such as Orion s Arm and Galaxiki  which encourage collaborative development of science fiction universes  In some cases  the copyright owners of the books  films  or television series have instructed their lawyers to issue  cease and desist  letters to fans   edit  Science fiction studies For more details on this topic  see Science fiction studies  The study of science fiction  or science fiction studies  is the critical assessment  interpretation  and discussion of science fiction literature  film  new media  fandom  and fan fiction  Science fiction scholars take science fiction as an object of study in order to better understand it and its relationship to science  technology  politics  and culture at large  Science fiction studies has a long history dating back to the turn of the 20th century  but it was not until later that science fiction studies solidified as a discipline with the publication of the academic journals Extrapolation  1959   Foundation   The International Review of Science Fiction  1972   and Science Fiction Studies  1973   and the establishment of the oldest organizations devoted to the study of science fiction  the Science Fiction Research Association and the Science Fiction Foundation  in 1970  The field has grown considerably since the 1970s with the establishment of more journals  organizations  and conferences with ties to the science fiction scholarship community  and science fiction degree granting programs such as those offered by the University of Liverpool and Kansas University  The National Science Foundation has conducted surveys of  Public Attitudes and Public Understanding  of  Science Fiction and Pseudoscience   93  They write that  Interest in science fiction may affect the way people think about or relate to science    one study found a strong relationship between preference for science fiction novels and support for the space program   The same study also found that students who read science fiction are much more likely than other students to believe that contacting extraterrestrial civilizations is both possible and desirable  Bainbridge 1982   94   edit  Science fiction as serious literature Mary Shelley wrote a number of science fiction novels including Frankenstein  and is treated as a major Romantic writer  95  Many science fiction works have received widespread critical acclaim including Childhood s End and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep   the inspiration for the movie Blade Runner   A number of respected writers of mainstream literature have written science fiction  including Aldous Huxley s Brave New World  George Orwells Nineteen Eighty Four  Anthony Burgess  A Clockwork Orange and Margaret Atwood s The Handmaid s Tale  Nobel Laureate Doris Lessing wrote a series of SF novels  Canopus in Argos  and nearly all of Kurt Vonnegut s works contain science fiction premises or themes  The scholar Tom Shippey asks a perennial question of science fiction   What is its relationship to fantasy fiction  is its readership still dominated by male adolescents  is it a taste which will appeal to the mature but non eccentric literary mind   96  In her much reprinted essay  Science Fiction and Mrs Brown   97  the science fiction writer Ursula K  Le Guin has approached an answer by first citing the essay written by the English author Virginia Woolf entitled  Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown  in which she states  I believe that all novels    deal with character  and that it is to express character   not to preach doctrines  sing songs  or celebrate the glories of the British Empire  that the form of the novel  so clumsy  verbose  and undramatic  so rich  elastic  and alive  has been evolved   The great novelists have brought us to see whatever they wish us to see through some character  Otherwise they would not be novelists  but poets  historians  or pamphleteers  Le Guin argues that these criteria may be successfully applied to works of science fiction and so answers in the affirmative her rhetorical question posed at the beginning of her essay   Can a science fiction writer write a novel   Tom Shippey 96  in his essay does not dispute this answer but identifies and discusses the essential differences that exists between a science fiction novel and one written outside the field  To this end  he compares George Orwell s Coming Up for Air with Frederik Pohl and C  M  Kornbluth s The Space Merchants and concludes that the basic building block and distinguishing feature of a science fiction novel is the presence of the novum  a term Darko Suvin adapts from Ernst Bloch and defines as  a discrete piece of information recognizable as not true  but also as not unlike true  not flatly   and in the current state of knowledge  impossible   98  In science fiction the style of writing is often relatively clear and straightforward compared to classical literature  Orson Scott Card  an author of both science fiction and non SF fiction  has postulated that in science fiction the message and intellectual significance of the work is contained within the story itself and  therefore  there need not be stylistic gimmicks or literary games  but that many writers and critics confuse clarity of language with lack of artistic merit  In Card s words     a great many writers and critics have based their entire careers on the premise that anything that the general public can understand without mediation is worthless drivel        If everybody came to agree that stories should be told this clearly  the professors of literature would be out of job  and the writers of obscure  encoded fiction would be  not honored  but pitied for their impenetrability   99  Science fiction author and physicist Gregory Benford has declared that   SF is perhaps the defining genre of the twentieth century  although its conquering armies are still camped outside the Rome of the literary citadels   100  This sense of exclusion was articulated by Jonathan Lethem in an essay published in the Village Voice entitled  Close Encounters  The Squandered Promise of Science Fiction   101  Lethem suggests that the point in 1973 when Thomas Pynchon s Gravity s Rainbow was nominated for the Nebula Award  and was passed over in favor of Arthur C  Clarke s Rendezvous with Rama  stands as  a hidden tombstone marking the death of the hope that SF was about to merge with the mainstream   Among the responses to Lethem was one from the editor of the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction who asked   When is it  the SF genre  ever going to realize it can t win the game of trying to impress the mainstream   102  On this point the journalist and author David Barnett has remarked  103  The ongoing  endless war between  literary  fiction and  genre  fiction has well defined lines in the sand  Genre s foot soldiers think that literary fiction is a collection of meaningless but prettily drawn pictures of the human condition  The literary guard consider genre fiction to be crass  commercial  whizz bang potboilers  Or so it goes  Barnett  in an earlier essay had pointed to a new development in this  endless war   104  What do novels about a journey across post apocalyptic America  a clone waitress rebelling against a future society  a world girdling pipe of special gas keeping mutant creatures at bay  a plan to rid a colonizable new world of dinosaurs  and genetic engineering in a collapsed civilization have in common  They are all most definitely not science fiction  Literary readers will probably recognise The Road by Cormac McCarthy  one of the sections of Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell  The Gone Away World by Nick Harkaway  The Stone Gods by Jeanette Winterson and Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood from their descriptions above  All of these novels use the tropes of what most people recognize as science fiction  but their authors or publishers have taken great pains to ensure that they are not categorized as such   edit  Science fiction world wide Although perhaps most developed as a genre and community in the United States  Canada  and the United Kingdom  Science Fiction is a worldwide phenomenon  Organisations devoted to promotion and even translation in particular countries are commonplace  as are country  or language specific genre awards   edit  Africa and African diaspora Mohammed Dib  an Algerian writer  wrote a science fiction allegory about his nation s politics  Qui se souvient de la mer   Who Remembers the Sea    in 1962   105 Masimba Musodza  a Zimbabwean author  published MunaHacha Maive Nei  the first science fiction novel in the Shona language  106  which also holds the distinction of being the first novel in the Shona language to appear as an ebook first before it came out in print  In South Africa  a movie titled District 9 came out in 2009  an apartheid allegory featuring extraterrestrial life forms  produced by Peter Jackson   edit  Asia and the Middle East Main articles  Bengali science fiction  Science fiction in China  and Japanese science fiction Indian science fiction  defined loosely as science fiction by writers of Indian descent  began with the English language publication of Kylas Chundar Dutt s A Journal of Forty Eight Hours in the Year 1945 in the Calcutta Literary Gazette  June 6  1835   Since this story was intended as a political polemic  credit for the first science fiction story is often given to later Bengali authors such as Jagadananda Roy  Hemlal Dutta and the polymath Jagadish Chandra Bose  see Bengali science fiction   Similar traditions exist in Hindi  Marathi  Tamil and English  107  In English  the modern era of Indian speculative fiction began with the works of authors such as Samit Basu  Payal Dhar  Vandana Singh and Anil Menon  Works such as Amitav Ghosh s The Calcutta Chromosome and Salman Rushdie s Grimus and Boman Desai s The Memory of Elephants are generally classified as magic realist works but make essential use of SF tropes and techniques  Modern science fiction in China mainly depends on the magazine Science Fiction World  Many famous works were published in installments in it originally  including the most successful fiction Three Body  written by Liu Cixin  Chalomot Be aspamia is an Israeli magazine of short science fiction and fantasy stories  The Prophecies Of Karma  published in 2011  is advertised as the first work of science fiction by an

in German is Perry Rhodan  which started in 1961  Having sold over one billion copies  in pulp format   it claims to be the most successful science fiction book series ever written worldwide  108   edit  France  other Francophone countries  and Qu bec Jules Verne is a 19th French novelist known for his pioneering science fiction works  Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea  A Journey to the Center of the Earth  From the Earth to the Moon    A particular trend in French literature of the 20th century has consisted of notorious French authors releasing science fiction works alongside their more classical production  and through the same channels  refusing to endorse the science fiction label  probably out of a mix of snobbishness and chauvinism  science fiction being considered by most academics as an inferior genre from America   Among these lie famous novels and short stories by Ren  Barjavel and Robert Merle  for example  citation needed  The genre has long been called  anticipation   There is  nevertheless  a dedicated science fiction scene in French literature  see main article  In Belgian and French movies  science fiction is represented  but not nearly as much as drama  comedy  or historical film  In Belgian and French comic books  on the other hand  science fiction is  among other things  a well established  and often pessimistic  genre  citation needed  In the case of Canada s Qu bec   lisabeth Vonarburg and other authors developed a related tradition of French Canadian SF  The Prix Boreal was established in 1979 to honour Canadian science fiction works in French  The Aurora Awards  briefly preceded by the Casper Award  were founded in 1980 to recognize and promote the best works of Canadian science fiction in both French and English  Also  due to Canada s bilingualism and the US publishing almost exclusively in English  translation of Science Fiction prose into French thrives and runs nearly parallel upon a book s publishing in the original English  A sizeable market also exists within Qu bec for European written Francophone science fiction literature   edit  Oceania Main article  Science fiction in Australia Australia  David G  Hartwell noted that while there is perhaps  nothing essentially Australian about Australian science fiction   many Australian science fiction  and fantasy and horror  writers are in fact international English language writers  and their work is commonly published worldwide  This is further explainable by the fact that the Australian inner market is small  with Australian population being around 21 million   and sales abroad are crucial to most Australian writers  109  110   edit  North America Main articles  Canadian science fiction and Science fiction in the United States  edit  Latin America Although there is still some controversy as to when science fiction began in Latin America  the earliest works date from the late 19th century  All published in 1875  O Doutor Benignus by the Brazilian Augusto Em lio Zaluar  El Maravilloso Viaje del Sr  Nic Nac by the Argentinian Eduardo Holmberg  and Historia de un Muerto by the Cuban Francisco Calcagno are three of the earliest novels which appeared in the continent  111  Up to the 1960s  science fiction was the work of isolated writers who did not identify themselves with the genre  but rather used its elements to criticize society  promote their own agendas or tap into the public s interest in pseudo sciences  It received a boost of respectability after mainstream authors such as Horacio Quiroga and Jorge Luis Borges used its elements in their writings  This  in turn  led to the permanent emergence of science fiction in the 1960s and mid 1970s  notably in Argentina  Brazil  Chile  Mexico  and Cuba  Magic realism enjoyed parallel growth in Latin America  with a strong regional emphasis on using the form to comment on social issues  similar to social science fiction and speculative fiction in the English world  Economic turmoil and the suspicious eye of the dictatorial regimes in place reduced the genre s dynamism for the following decade  In the mid 1980s  it became increasingly popular once more  Although led by Argentina  Brazil and Mexico  Latin America now hosts dedicated communities and writers with an increasing use of regional elements to set them apart from English language science fiction  112   edit  See also
