Polynesia From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search This article is about the wider region in the Pacific  For the French territory  see French Polynesia  For other uses  see Polynesian  disambiguation   Polynesia is the largest of three major cultural areas in the Pacific Ocean  Polynesia is generally defined as the islands within the Polynesian triangle  Geographic definition of Polynesia  surrounded by a pink line Polynesia  from Greek         polys  many          n sos  island  is a subregion of Oceania  made up of over 1 000 islands scattered over the central and southern Pacific Ocean  The indigenous people who inhabit the islands of Polynesia are termed Polynesians and they share many similar traits including language  culture and beliefs  1  Historically  they were experienced sailors and used stars to determine their night hours  The term  Polynesia  was first used in 1756 by French writer Charles de Brosses  and originally applied to all the islands of the Pacific  In 1831  Jules Dumont d Urville proposed a restriction on its use during a lecture to the Geographical Society of Paris  Contents 1 Geography 1 1 Geology 1 2 Geographic

Geology Polynesia is characterized by a small amount of land spread over 70 million square miles of Pacific Ocean  Most Polynesian islands and archipelagos  including the Hawaiian islands and Samoa  are composed of volcanic islands built by hotspots  New Zealand  Norfolk Island  and Ouv a  the Polynesian outlier near New Caledonia  are the unsubmerged portions of the largely sunken continent of Zealandia  Zealandia is believed to have mostly sunken by 23 mya and resurfaced geologically recently due to a change in the movements of the Pacific Plate in relation to the Indo Australian plate  which served to uplift the New Zealand portion  At first  the Pacific plate was subducted under the Australian plate  The Alpine Fault that traverses the South Island is currently a transform fault while the convergent plate boundary from the North Island Northwards is a subduction zone called the Kermadec Tonga Subduction Zone  The volcanism associated with this subduction zone is the origin of the Kermadec and Tongan island archipelagos  Out of about 117 000 or 118 000 square miles of land  over 103 000 square miles are within New Zealand  The Zealandia continent has approximately 1 4 million square miles of continental shelf  The oldest rocks in the region are found in New Zealand and are believed to be about 510 million years old  The oldest Polynesian rocks outside of Zealandia are to be found in the Hawaiian Emperor Seamount Chain  and are 80 million years old   edit  Geographic area Polynesia is generally defined as the islands within the Polynesian Triangle although there are some islands that are inhabited by Polynesian people situated outside the Polynesian Triangle  Geographically  the Polynesian Triangle is drawn by connecting the points of Hawaii  New Zealand and Easter Island  The other main island groups located within the Polynesian Triangle are Samoa  Tonga  the Cook Islands  Tuvalu  Tokelau  Niue  Wallis and Futuna and French Polynesia  There are also small Polynesian settlements in Papua New Guinea  the Solomon Islands  The Caroline Islands  and in Vanuatu  An island group with strong Polynesian cultural traits outside of this great triangle is Rotuma  situated north of Fiji  The people of Rotuma have many common Polynesian traits but speak a non Polynesian language  Some of the Lau Islands to the southeast of Fiji have strong historic and cultural links with Tonga  However  in essence  Polynesia is a cultural term referring to one of the three parts of Oceania  the others being Micronesia and Melanesia   DNA studies suggest that the indigenous Pacific Islands population migrated from Taiwan thousands of years ago and dispersed throughout the region into three distinct cultural groups   edit  Island groups Cook s Bay on Moorea

Mainstream theories The Polynesian people are considered to be by linguistic  archaeological and human genetic ancestry a subset of the sea migrating Austronesian people and tracing Polynesian languages places their prehistoric origins  ultimately  in Taiwan  At about 2000 BC speakers of Austronesian languages began spreading from Taiwan into Island Southeast Asia  8  9  10  Their speech of the time was not clearly related to Chinese speech of the time and Chinese speakers were all further north on the mainland at the turn of the second and third millennia BC  Taiwan was only later Sinicized via large scale immigration accompanied by much assimilation of the Austronesian speaking indigenous people during the 17th century AD  There are three theories regarding the spread of humans across the Pacific to Polynesia  These are outlined well by Kayser et al   2000  11  and are as follows  Express Train model  A recent  c  2 000 BC  expansion out of Taiwan  via the Philippines and eastern Indonesia and from the northwest   Bird s Head   of New Guinea  on to Island Melanesia by roughly 1 400 BC years ago  reaching western Polynesian islands right about 900 BC  This theory is supported by the majority of current human genetic data  linguistic data  and archaeological data  citation needed  Entangled Bank model  Emphasizes the long history of Austronesian speakers  cultural and genetic interactions with indigenous Island Southeast Asians and Melanesians along the way to becoming the first Polynesians  citation needed  Slow Boat model  Similar to the express train model but with a longer hiatus in Melanesia along with admixture  both genetically  culturally and linguistically with the local population  This is supported by the Y chromosome data of Kayser et al   2000   which shows that all three haplotypes of Polynesian Y chromosomes can be traced back to Melanesia  citation needed  Grinding stones discovered from archaeology in Samoa In the archaeological record there are well defined traces of this expansion which allow the path it took to be followed and dated with some certainty  It is thought that by roughly 1 400 BC  12   Lapita Peoples   so named after their pottery tradition  appeared in the Bismarck Archipelago of northwest Melanesia  This culture is seen as having adapted and evolved through time and space since its emergence  Out of Taiwan   They had given up rice production  for instance  after encountering and adapting to breadfruit in the Bird s Head area of New Guinea  In the end  the most eastern site for Lapita archaeological remains recovered so far has been through work on the archaeology in Samoa  The site is at Mulifanua on Upolu  The Mulifanua site  where 4 288 pottery shards have been found and studied  has a  true  age of c  1 000 BC based on C14 dating  13   Other long work by other respected archaelogists places the beginning of the human archaeological sequences of Polynesia in Tonga at 900 B C  14   the small differences in dates with Samoa being due to differences in radiocarbon dating technologies between 1989 and 2010  the Tongan site apparently predating the Samoan site by some few decades in real time  Within a mere three or four centuries between about 1300 and 900 BC  the Lapita archaeological  culture  spread 6 000 km further to the east from the Bismarck Archipelago  until it reached as far as Fiji  Tonga  and Samoa which were first populated around 3 000 years ago as mentioned previously  A cultural divide began to develop between Fiji to the west  and the distinctive Polynesian language and culture emerging on Tonga and Samoa to the east  Where there was once faint evidence of uniquely shared developments in Fijian and Polynesian speech  most of this is now called  borrowing  and is thought to have occurred insidiously in those and later years more than as a result of continuing unity of their earliest dialects on those far flung lands  Contacts were mediated especially through the eastern Lau Islands of Fiji and this is where most Fijian Polynesian linguistic interaction occurred  Tiny populations seem to have been involved at first  15  They were matrilineal and matrilocal peoples upon arrival to Fiji  Tonga and Samoa and had been through at least some goodly portion of their time in the Bismarck Archipelago  The modern Polynesians  in their profound isolation from the world beyond  still show the human genetic results of a culture  when their ancestors were still in Melanesia  that allowed indigenous men  but not women  to  marry in    deadly useful evidence for matrilocality  16  17  9  18  Matrilocality and matrilineality went by the bye at some early time but Polynesians and most other Austronesian speakers in the Pacific Islands were are still highly  matricentric  in their traditional jurisprudence  19  The Lapita pottery for which the general archaeological complex of the earliest  Oceanic  Austronesian speakers in the Pacific Islands are named also went by the bye in Western Polynesia and language  social life and material culture were very distinctly  Polynesian  by the time Eastern Polynesia began to be settled after a  Pause  of 1000 years or perhaps well more in Western Polynesia  The dating of the settlement of Eastern Polynesia including Hawai i  Easter Island  and New Zealand is not agreed upon in every instance  Most recently a 2010 study using meta analysis of the most reliable radiocarbon dates available suggested that the colonization of Eastern Polynesia  including Hawaii and New Zealand  proceeded in two short episodes  in the Society Islands from 1025 1120 AD and further afield from 1190 1290 AD  20  with Easter Island being settled around 1200  21  22 Other archeological models developed in recent decades  which are challenged by that recent set of radiocarbon dating interpretations  have pointed to dates of between 300 and 500 AD  or alternatively 800 AD  as supported by Jared Diamond  for the settlement of Easter Island  and similarly  a date of 500 AD has been suggested for Hawaii  Linguistically  there is a very distinct  East Polynesian  subgroup with many shared innovations not seen in other Polynesian languages  Easter Island Rapa Nui is mysteriously the first to have established itself outside the group  The Marquesas dialects seem to be the source of the oldest Hawaiian speech which is overlaid by Tahitian variety speech  as Hawaiian oral histories would suggest  The earliest varieties of New Zealand Maori speech may have had multiple sources from around central Eastern Polynesia as Maori oral histories would suggest  Much linguistic and archaeological work has been done since World War II but it will apparently take a good deal more to resolve the  oldest    only   and  never  sorts of questions the linguists  archaeologists  geneticists and others have been able to resolve to some extent for Western Polynesia   edit  Political history of Polynesia Perhaps the oldest extensive political entity was that of the Samoa based Tu i Manu a Confederacy  ruled by the holders of the Tu i Manu a title  which may well be the oldest chieftain title in Polynesia  This confederacy likely included much of Western Polynesia and some outliers at the height of its power in the 10th and 11th centuries  most notably  the Samoa  Tonga  Lau Islands and perhaps the main islands of Fiji  The Tongans revolted around 1000 years ago and formed their own Tu i Tonga empire that came to dominate Samoa  Tonga  and Fiji  with an influence stretching from Nauru in the Northwest  to Niue in the East  The empire ruled for much of the Medieval period  until the Samoan revolt and subsequent rise of the Malietoa dynasties in Samoa  and ended with their capitulation to the Tongan Tu i Ha atakalaua dynasty in the 15th century   edit  Tonga 1500s present After a bloody civil war  political power in Tonga eventually fell under the Tu i Kanokupolu dynasty in the 16th century  In 1845 the ambitious young warrior  strategist  and orator T ufa  hau united Tonga into more Western style kingdom  He held the chiefly title of Tu i Kanokupolu  but had been baptised by whom   with the name Jiaoji   George   in 1831  In 1875  with the help of missionary Shirley Waldemar Baker  he declared Tonga a constitutional monarchy  formally adopted the western royal style  emancipated the  serfs   enshrined a code of law  land tenure  and freedom of the press  and limited the power of the chiefs  Tonga became a British protected state under a Treaty of Friendship on 18 May 1900  when European settlers and rival Tongan chiefs tried to oust the second king  Within the British Empire  which posted no higher permanent representative on Tonga than a British Consul  1901 1970   Tonga formed part of the British Western Pacific Territories  under a colonial High Commissioner  residing on Fiji  from 1901 until 1952  Despite being under the protectorate  Tonga retained its monarchy without interruption  On June 4  1970 the Kingdom of Tonga received independence from the British protectorate   edit  Samoa Malietoa present Samoa remained under Malietoa chieftains until its East West division by Tripartite Convention  1899  subsequent annexation by the German Empire and the United States  The German controlled Western portion of Samoa  the consisting of the bulk of Samoan territory  was occupied by New Zealand in WWI  and administered by it under a Class C League of Nations Mandate until receiving independence on January 1  1962  The new Independent State of Samoa was not a monarchy  though the Malietoa title holder remained very influential  It officially ended  however with the death of Malietoa Tanumafili II on May 11  2007   edit  Tahiti See  Pomare Dynasty   edit  Hawaii See  Kingdom of Hawaii   edit  New Zealand Maori On October 28  1835 members of the Ng  Puhi and surrounding iwi issued a  declaration of independence   as a  confederation of tribes  to resist potential French colonization efforts and to prevent the ships and cargo of Maori merchants from being seized at foreign ports  They received recognition from the British monarch in 1836   See United Tribes of New Zealand  New Zealand Declaration of Independence  James Busby   Using the Treaty of Waitangi and right of discovery as a basis  the United Kingdom annexed New Zealand as a part of New South Wales in 1840  In response to the actions of the colonial government  Maori looked to form monarchy inclusive of all Maori tribes in order to reduce vulnerability to the British divide and conquer strategy  P tatau Te Wherowhero high priest and chief of the Ng ti Mahuta tribe of the Waikato iwi was crowned as the Maori king in 1858  The king s territory consisted primarily of the lands in the center of the North Island  and the iwi constituted from the most powerful non signatories of the Treaty of Waitangi  with Te Wherowhero also never having signed it  23   See Kingitanga   All tribes were pressed into subjection to the colonial government by the late 19th century  Although Maori were given the privilege of being legally enfranchised subjects of the British Empire under the Treaty  Maori culture and language were actively suppressed by the colonial government and by economic and social pressures from the Pakeha society until efforts were made to preserve indigenous culture starting in the late 1950s and culminating in the Waitangi Tribunal s interpretation of language and culture being included in the treasures set to be preserved under the Treaty of Waitangi  Moving from a low point of 15 000 speakers in the 1970s  there are now over 157 000 people who have some proficiency in the standard M ori language according to the 2006 census 24  in New Zealand  due in large part to government recognition and promotion of the language  Maori are very much integrated into New Zealand society  and many are of mixed Maori and European  Asian  or Pacific Islander heritage  The New Zealand Defense forces are over half Maori  and the New Zealand Special Forces are 2 3 Maori  Jerry Mateparae  the former chief of the armed forces  now serves as Governor General of New Zealand  A Canadian delegation was sent to New Zealand in order to gather information on New Zealand s recruiting process and culture at large in order to create a plan to increase the proportion of Canadian Aboriginals in its armed forces  However  despite major achievements towards equality  Maori are still under represented in many fields   edit  Fiji  See  History of Fiji  Seru Epenisa Cakobau  Fiji during the time of Cakobau   The Lau islands had after the Tu i Mana u dynasty were subject to periods of Tongan and then Fijian control until their eventual conquest by Seru Epenisa Cakobau of the Kingdom of Fiji by 1871  In around 1855 a Tongan prince  Enele Ma afu  proclaimed the Lau islands as his kingdom  and took the title Tui Lau  Fiji itself had been ruled by numerous divided chieftains until Cakobau unified the landmass  The Lapita culture  the ancestors of the Polynesians  existed in Fiji from 3500 BCE until they were displaced by the Melanesians about a thousand years later   Interestingly  Samoans and subsequent Polynesian cultures adopted Melanesian face painting methods   In 1873  Cakobau ceded a Fiji heavily indebted to foreign creditors to the United Kingdom  It became independent on 10 October 1970 and a republic on 28 September 1987   edit  Cook Islands See  Kingdom of Rarotonga   edit  Tuvalu The stories as to the ancestors of the Tuvaluans vary from island to island  On Funafuti and Vaitupu the founding ancestor is described as being from Samoa  25  26  whereas on Nanumea the founding ancestor is described as being from Tonga  25  These stories can be linked to what is known about the Samoa based Tu i Manu a Confederacy  ruled by the holders of the Tu i Manu a title  which confederacy likely included much of Western Polynesia and some outliers at the height of its power in the 10th and 11th centuries  and the extent of influence of the Tu i Tonga line of Tongan kings  which originated in the 10th century  While the existence of the Tu i Tonga Empire is disputed  Tuvalu is thought to have been visited by Tongans in the mid 13th century and was within Tonga s sphere of influence  26   See  History of Tuvalu    edit  Polynesian links to the Americas See also  Pre Columbian trans oceanic contact The sweet potato  called k mara in M ori  which is native to the Americas  was widespread in Polynesia when Europeans first reached the Pacific  Remains of the plant have been radiocarbon dated in the Cook Islands to 1000 AD  and current thinking is that it was brought to central Polynesia circa 700 CE and spread across Polynesia from there  possibly by Polynesians who had traveled to South America and back  27  Thor Heyerdahl proposed in the mid 20th century that the Polynesians had migrated from South America on balsa log boats  28  29  Many anthropologists have criticised Heyerdahl s theory  including Wade Davis in his book The Wayfinders  Davis says that Heyerdahl  ignored the overwhelming body of linguistic  ethnographic  and ethnobotanical evidence  augmented today by genetic and archaeological data  indicating that he was patently wrong   30   edit  Cultures of Polynesia Main article  Polynesian culture Painting of Tahitian Women on the Beach by Paul Gauguin Mus e d Orsay Polynesia divides into two distinct cultural groups  East Polynesia and West Polynesia  The culture of West Polynesia is conditioned to high populations  It has strong institutions of marriage and well developed judicial  monetary and trading traditions  It comprises the groups of Tonga  Niue  Samoa and the northwestern Polynesian outliers  Eastern Polynesian cultures are highly adapted to smaller islands and atolls  principally the Cook Islands  Tahiti  the Tuamotus  the Marquesas  Hawaii  Rapa Nui and smaller central pacific groups  The large islands of New Zealand were first settled by Eastern Polynesians who adapted their culture to a non tropical environment  Unlike in Melanesia  leaders were chosen in Polynesia based on their hereditary bloodline  Samoa however  had another system of government that combines elements of heredity and real world skills to choose leaders  This system is called Fa amatai  31  According to Ben R  Finney and Eric M  Jones   On Tahiti  for example  the 35 000 Polynesians living there at the time of European discovery were divided between high status persons with full access to food and other resources  and low status persons with limited access   32  Carving from the ridgepole of a M ori house  ca 1840 Religion  farming  fishing  weather prediction  out rigger canoe  similar to modern catamarans  construction and navigation were highly developed skills because the population of an entire island depended on them  Trading of both luxuries and mundane items was important to all groups  Periodic droughts and subsequent famines often lead to war  32  Many low lying islands could suffer severe famine if their gardens were poisoned by the salt from the storm surge of a hurricane  In these cases fishing  the primary source of protein  would not ease loss of food energy  Navigators  in particular  were highly respected and each island maintained a house of navigation with a canoe building area  Settlements by the Polynesians were of two categories  the hamlet and the village  Size of the island inhabited determined whether or a not a hamlet would be built  The larger volcanic islands usually had hamlets because of the many zones that could be divided across the island  Food and resources were more plentiful and so these settlements of four to five houses  usually with gardens  were established so that there would be no overlap between the zones  Villages  on the other hand  were built on the coasts of smaller islands and consisted of thirty or more houses in the case of atolls  on only one of the group so that food cultivation was on the others  Usually these villages were fortified with walls and palisades made of stone and wood  33  However  New Zealand demonstrates the opposite  large volcanic islands with fortified villages  As well as being great navigators these people were artists and artisans of great skill  Simple objects  such as fish hooks would be manufactured to exacting standards for different catches and decorated even when the decoration was not part of the function  Stone and wooden weapons were considered to be more powerful the better they were made and decorated  In some island groups weaving was a strong part of the culture and gifting woven articles an ingrained practice  Dwellings were imbued with character by the skill of their building  Body decoration and jewellery is of international standard to this day  The religious attributes of Polynesians were common over the whole Pacific region  While there are some differences in their spoken languages they largely have the same explanation for the creation of the earth and sky  for the gods that rule aspects of life and for the religious practices of everyday life  People travelled thousands of miles to celebrations that they all owned communally  Due to relatively large numbers of competitive sects of Christian missionaries in the islands  many Polynesian groups have been converted to Christianity  Polynesian languages are all members of the family of Oceanic languages  a sub branch of the Austronesian language family   edit  Polynesian languages Main article  Polynesian languages Polynesian languages show a considerable degree of similarity  The vowels are generally the same a  e  i  o  and u  pronounced as in Italian  Spanish  and German and the consonants are always followed by a vowel  The languages of various island groups show changes in consonants  R and v are used in central and eastern Polynesia whereas l and v are used in western Polynesia  The glottal stop is increasingly represented by an inverted comma or  okina  In the Society Islands  the original Proto Polynesian  k and  ng have merged as glottal stop  so the name for the ancestral homeland  deriving from Proto Nuclear Polynesian  sawaiki  34  becomes Havai i  In New Zealand  where the original  w is used instead of v  the ancient home is Hawaiki  In the Cook Islands  where the glottal stop replaces the original  s  with a likely intermediate stage of  h   it is  Avaiki  In the Hawaiian islands  where the glottal stop replaces the original k  the largest island of the group is named Hawai i  In Samoa  where the original s is used instead of h  v replaces w  and the glottal stop replaces the original k  the largest island is called Savai i  1   edit  Economy With the exception of New Zealand  the majority of independent Polynesian islands derive much of their income from foreign aid and remittances from those who live in other countries  Some encourage their young people to go where they can earn good money to remit to their stay at home relatives  Many Polynesian locations  such as Easter Island  supplement this with tourism income  35  Some have more unusual sources of income  such as Tuvalu which marketed its   tv  internet top level domain name 36  or the Cooks that relied on stamp sales  Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi  Prime Minister of Samoa  who initiated the Polynesian Leaders Group in late 2011   edit  Political union After several years of discussing a potential regional grouping  three sovereign states  Samoa  Tonga and Tuvalu  and five self governing but non sovereign territories formally launched  in November 2011  the Polynesian Leaders Group  intended to cooperate on a variety of issues including culture and language  education  responses to climate change  and trade and investment  It does not  however  constitute a political or monetary union  37  38  39   edit  Polynesian navigation Main article  Polynesian navigation Polynesia comprised islands diffused throughout a triangular area with sides of four thousand miles  The area from the Hawaiian Islands in the north  to Easter Island in the east and to New Zealand in the south were all settled by Polynesians  Navigators traveled to small inhabited islands using only their own senses and knowledge passed by oral tradition from navigator to apprentice  In order to locate directions at various times of day and year  navigators in Eastern Polynesia memorized important facts  the motion of specific stars  and where they would rise on the horizon of the ocean  weather  times of travel  wildlife species  which congregate at particular positions   directions of swells on the ocean  and how the crew would feel their motion  colors of the sea and sky  especially how clouds would cluster at the locations of some islands  and angles for approaching harbors  Polynesian  Hawaiian  navigators sailing multi hulled canoe  ca 1781  A common fishing canoe va a with outrigger in Savai i island  Samoa  2009  These wayfinding techniques along with outrigger canoe construction methods  were kept as guild secrets  Generally each island maintained a guild of navigators who had very high status  in times of famine or difficulty these navigators could trade for aid or evacuate people to neighboring islands  To this day  original traditional methods of Polynesian Navigation are still taught in the Polynesian outlier of Taumako Island in the Solomon Islands  From a single chicken bone recovered from the archaeological site of El Arenal 1  on the Arauco Peninsula  Chile  a 2007 research report looking at radiocarbon dating and an ancient DNA sequence indicate that Polynesian navigators may have reached the Americas at least 100 years before Columbus  who arrived 1492 AD   introducing chickens to South America  40  41  A later report looking at the same specimens concluded  A published  apparently pre Columbian  Chilean specimen and six pre European Polynesian specimens also cluster with the same European Indian subcontinental Southeast Asian sequences  providing no support for a Polynesian introduction of chickens to South America  In contrast  sequences from two archaeological sites on Easter Island group with an uncommon haplogroup from Indonesia  Japan  and China and may represent a genetic signature of an early Polynesian dispersal  Modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the Chilean archaeological specimen casts further doubt on claims for pre Columbian chickens  and definitive proof will require further analyses of ancient DNA sequences and radiocarbon and stable isotope data from archaeological excavations within both Chile and Polynesia  42  Knowledge of the traditional Polynesian methods of navigation were largely lost after contact with and colonization by Europeans  This left the problem of accounting for the presence of the Polynesians in such isolated and scattered parts of the Pacific  By the late 19th century to the early 20th century a more generous view of Polynesian navigation had come into favor  perhaps creating a romantic picture of their canoes  seamanship and navigational expertise  In the mid to late 1960s  scholars began testing sailing and paddling experiments related to Polynesian navigation  David Lewis sailed his catamaran from Tahiti to New Zealand using stellar navigation without instruments and Ben Finney built a 40 foot replica of a Hawaiian double canoe  Nalehia  and tested it in Hawaii  Meanwhile  Micronesian ethnographic research in the Caroline Islands revealed that traditional stellar navigational methods were still in every day use  Recent re creations of Polynesian voyaging have used methods based largely on Micronesian methods and the teachings of a Micronesian navigator  Mau Piailug  It is probable that the Polynesian navigators employed a whole range of techniques including use of the stars  the movement of ocean currents and wave patterns  the air and sea interference patterns caused by islands and atolls  the flight of birds  the winds and the weather  Scientists think that long distance Polynesian voyaging followed the seasonal paths of birds  There are some references in their oral traditions to the flight of birds and some say that there were range marks onshore pointing to distant islands in line with these flyways  One theory is that they would have taken a frigatebird with them  These birds refuse to land on the water as their feathers will become waterlogged making it impossible to fly  When the voyagers thought they were close to land they may have released the bird  which would either fly towards land or else return to the canoe  It is likely that the Polynesians also used wave and swell formations to navigate  It is thought that the Polynesian navigators may have measured the time it took to sail between islands in  canoe days   or a similar type of expression  Also  people of the Marshall Islands used special devices called stick charts  showing the places and directions of swells and wave breaks  with tiny seashells affixed to them to mark the positions of islands along the way  Materials for these maps were readily available on beaches  and their making was simple  however  their effective use needed years and years of study  43   edit  See also Geography portal Oceania portal List of Polynesians Polynesian mythology Polynesian Society Polynesian
