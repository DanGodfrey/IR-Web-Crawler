Carolina South Carolina is composed of five geographic areas  or physiographic provinces  whose boundaries roughly parallel the Atlantic coastline  In the southeast part of the state is the Coastal Plain  which can be divided into the Outer and Inner Coastal Plains  From north to south the coast is divided into three separate areas  the Grand Strand  the Santee River Delta  and the Sea Islands  Further inland are the Sandhills  ancient dunes from what used to be South Carolina s coast millions of years ago  The Fall Line  which marks the limit of navigable rivers  runs along the boundary of the Sandhills and the Piedmont  which has rolling hills and clay soils  In the northwest corner of the state are the Blue Ridge Mountains  the smallest geographical region in the state  The state s coastline contains many salt marshes and estuaries  as well as natural ports such as Georgetown and Charleston  An unusual feature of the coastal plain is a large number of Carolina bays  the origins of which are uncertain  One prominent  but incorrect  theory says that they were created by a meteor shower  The bays tend to be oval  lining up in a northwest to southeast orientation  The terrain is flat and the soil is composed entirely of recent sediments such as sand  silt  and clay  Areas with better drainage make excellent farmland  though some land is swampy  The natural areas of the coastal plain are part of the Middle Atlantic coastal forests ecoregion  5  Palmetto State State Symbols State Capital  Columbia State Mottos  Dum spiro spero  While I breathe  I hope  and Animis

sunken or the oceans were higher  The Piedmont  Upstate  region contains the roots of an ancient  eroded mountain chain  It is generally hilly  with thin  stony clay soils  and contains few areas suitable for farming  Much of the Piedmont was once farmed  with little success  It is now reforested  These forests are part of the Southeastern mixed forests ecoregion  5  At the southeastern edge of the Piedmont is the fall line  where rivers drop to the coastal plain  The fall line was an important early source of water power  Mills built to harness this resource encouraged the growth of several cities  including the capital  Columbia  The larger rivers are navigable up to the fall line  providing a trade route for mill towns  The northwestern part of the Piedmont is also known as the Foothills  The Cherokee Parkway is a scenic driving route through this area  This is where Table Rock State Park is located  Highest in elevation is the Blue Ridge Region  containing an escarpment of the Blue Ridge Mountains  which continue into North Carolina and Georgia  as part of the southern Appalachian chain  Sassafras Mountain  South Carolina s highest point at 3 560 feet  1 090 m  is located in this area  12  Also located in this area is Caesars Head State Park  The environment here is that of the Appalachian Blue Ridge forests ecoregion  5  The Chattooga River  located on the

Earthquakes do occur in South Carolina  The greatest frequency is along the central coastline of the state  in the Charleston area  South Carolina averages 10 15 earthquakes a year below magnitude 3  FEMA   The Charleston Earthquake of 1886 was the largest quake to ever hit the Southeastern United States  This 7 2 magnitude earthquake killed 60 people and destroyed much of the city  14  Faults in this region are difficult to study at the surface due to thick sedimentation on top of them  Many of the ancient faults are within plates rather than along plate boundaries   edit  Climate Snow is somewhat rare for most of the state with the upstate receiving it more often  Main article  Climate of South Carolina South Carolina has a humid subtropical climate  K ppen climate classification Cfa   although high elevation areas in the  Upstate  or  Upcountry  area have less subtropical characteristics than areas on the Atlantic coastline  In the summer  South Carolina is hot and humid with daytime temperatures averaging between 86 93  F  30 34  C  in most of the state and overnight lows averaging 70 74  F  21 23  C  on the coast and from 66 73  F  19 23  C  inland  Winter temperatures are much less uniform in South Carolina  Coastal areas of the state have very mild winters with high temperatures approaching an average of 60  F  16  C  and overnight lows in the 40s F  5 8  C   Inland  the average January overnight low is around 32  F  0  C  in Columbia and temperatures well below freezing in the Upstate  While precipitation is abundant the entire year in almost the entire state  the coast tends to have a slightly wetter summer  while inland  March tends to be the wettest month and winter being the driest season  with November being the driest month  The highest recorded temperature is 111  F  44  C  at Camden on June 28  1954 and the lowest recorded temperature is  19  F   28  C  at Caesars Head on January 21  1985  Snowfall in South Carolina is somewhat common in most of the state  while coastal areas receive less than an inch  2 5 cm  annually on average  It is not uncommon for areas along the coast  especially the southern coast  to receive no recordable snowfall in a given year  The interior receives a little more snow  although nowhere in the state averages more than 12 inches  30 cm  of snow annually  The mountains of extreme northwestern South Carolina tend to have the most substantial snow accumulation  Freezing rain and ice tend to be more common than snow and even rain in many areas of the state  Road bridges in South

cyclones  This is an annual concern during hurricane season  which lasts from June 1 to November 30  The peak time of vulnerability for the southeast Atlantic coast is from early August to early October  during the Cape Verde hurricane season  Memorable hurricanes to hit South Carolina include Hazel  1954   a Category 4 hurricane  and Hugo  1989   a Category 5 hurricane  South Carolina averages around 50 days of thunderstorm activity a year  This is less than some of the states further south  and it is slightly less vulnerable to tornadoes than the states which border on the Gulf of Mexico  Some notable tornadoes have struck South Carolina and the state averages around 14 tornadoes annually  Hail is common with many of the thunderstorms in the state as there is often a marked contrast in temperature of warmer ground conditions compared to the cold air aloft  17   edit  History Main article  History of South Carolina  edit  Early years Arcadia Plantation  circa 1893  Georgetown County The colony of Carolina was settled by English settlers  mostly from Barbados  18  King Charles gave eight aristocrats a royal charter to settle Carolina  Carolina is Latin for  Charles land   because earlier they had helped him regain his throne  Parts of Carolina  mostly the coastal areas  were colonized earlier by Spain  see Fort Caroline   but battles between the Spanish and the Native Americans caused the Spanish people to retreat to Florida  Cuba  Mexico  and Central and South America  Carolina was settled to make profit from trade and also by selling land  John Locke  an English philosopher  wrote a constitution for the colony that covered topics such as land divisions and social rankings  In the early years  not many people bought land there  so the proprietors lowered the price on some portions  Carolina did not develop as planned  It split into northern and southern Carolina  creating two different colonies  It separated because of political reasons as the settlers wanted political power  In 1719 settlers in southern Carolina seized control from its proprietors  Then  in 1729  Carolina became two royal colonies  North Carolina and South Carolina  Farmers from inland Virginia settled northern Carolina  They grew tobacco  and sold timber and tar  both categories of naval supplies needed by England  The northern Carolina coast lacked a good harbor  so many of the farmers used Virginia s ports to conduct their trade  Southern Carolina prospered from the fertility of the Low Country and the harbors  such as that at Charles Town  later Charleston   Settlements spread  and trade in deerskin  lumber  and beef thrived  Rice cultivation was developed on a large scale with the help of skills and techniques of slaves imported from rice growing regions of Africa  They created the large earthworks of dams and canals required to irrigate the rice fields  In addition  indigo became a commodity crop  also developed with the skills of African slaves  The cultivation and processing of indigo  a blue flowering plant  was developed here by a young English woman  Eliza Lucas  a planter s daughter who had come with her father  also a military officer  from the Caribbean  She took over managing the plantation when he was assigned elsewhere  Indigo became an important commodity crop for the dyeing of textiles  Slave labor was integral to the economic success of rice and indigo as commodity crops  In South Carolina  the number of slaves exceeded those of Anglo European colonists by the time of the Revolution  a characteristic of the state through the Civil War   edit  The American Revolution On March 26  1776  the colony set up its own provisional government under the leadership of South Carolina President John Rutledge  On February 5  1778  South Carolina became the first state to ratify the Articles of Confederation  the initial governing document of the United States  However  in 1780  South Carolinian loyalists to the British crown helped British troops recapture South Carolina from the previously successful rebels  On January 17  1781  the Battle of Cowpens won by the American forces  marked the beginning of the decline in British fortunes  In 1782 they decided to evacuate their troops by the end of the year  Thousands of Loyalists and slaves left with them  The current United States Constitution was proposed for adoption by the States on September 17  1787  and South Carolina was the 8th state to ratify it  on May 23  1788  The American Revolution caused a shock to slavery in the South  Many thousands of slaves fled to British authorities to obtain freedom  and many of those left with the British in the last days of the war  Others secured their freedom by escaping to perceived friendlier locations during the turmoil  Estimates are that 25 000 slaves  30  of those in South Carolina  fled  migrated or died during the disruption of the war  19  This historic home is at  The Battery   a neighborhood park area at the Downtown Historic District of Charleston   a well known historical city in South Carolina   The Battery  is also known as White Point Gardens   edit  The Federal Period South Carolina politics between 1783 and 1795 were marred by rivalry between a Federalist elite supporting the central government in Philadelphia and a large proportion of common people  The latter were often members of  Republican Societies   and they supported the Republican Democrats  headed by Jefferson and Madison  This party wanted more democracy in the US  especially in South Carolina  Most people supported the French Revolution  1789 1795   as the French had been allies and they were proud of their own revolution  Charleston was one of the most French influenced cities in the USA  Leading South Carolina figures  such as governors Charles Pinckney and William Moultrie  backed with money and actions the French plans to further their political  strategic  and commercial goals in North America  This pro French stance and attitude of South Carolina ended soon because of the XYZ Affair   edit  Antebellum Millford Plantation  1839   one of the most remarkable Greek revival mansions in the U S  Antebellum South Carolina did more to advance nullification and secession than any other Southern state  In 1832  a South Carolina state convention passed the Ordinance of Nullification  declaring the Federal tariff laws of 1828 and 1832 unconstitutional  null and not to be enforced in the state of South Carolina after February 1  1833  This led to the Nullification Crisis  in which U S  President Andrew Jackson received congressional authorization  through the Force Bill  to use whatever military force necessary to enforce Federal law in the state  This was the first U S  legislation denying individual states the right to secede  As a result of Jackson s threat of force  the South Carolina state convention was re convened and repealed the Ordinance of Nullification in March  Anti abolitionist feelings ran strong in South Carolina  In 1856  South Carolina congressman Preston Brooks entered the United States Senate chamber and  with a metal tipped cane  beat Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner  He drew blood and injured Sumner badly enough that the latter was unable to serve for several months  Brooks was retaliating for a speech Sumner had just given in which he attacked slavery and insulted South Carolinians  Brooks resigned his seat but received a hero s welcome on returning home   edit  The Civil War On December 20  1860  when it became clear that Abraham Lincoln would be the next president  South Carolina became the first state to declare its secession from the Union  On April 12  1861  Confederate batteries began shelling Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor  and the American Civil War began  The Union Navy effectively blockaded Charleston and seized the Sea Islands  Planters had taken their families  and sometimes slaves  to points inland for refuge  The Union Army set up an experiment in freedom for the ex slaves  in which they started education and farmed land for themselves  South Carolina troops participated in major Confederate campaigns  but no major battles were fought inland  General William Tecumseh Sherman marched through the state in early 1865  destroying numerous plantations  and captured the state capital of Columbia on February 17  Fires began that night and by next morning  most of the central city was destroyed  Coastal towns and cities often have hurricane resistant Live oaks overarching the streets in historic neighborhoods  such as these on East Bay Street  Georgetown   edit  Reconstruction After the war  South Carolina was restored to the United States during Reconstruction  Under presidential Reconstruction  1865 66   freedmen  former slaves  were given limited rights  Under Radical reconstruction  1867 1877   a Republican coalition of freedmen  carpetbaggers and scalawags was in control  supported by Union Army forces  The withdrawal of Union soldiers as part of the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction  White Democrats used paramilitary groups such as the Red Shirts to intimidate and terrorize black voters  They regained political control of the state under conservative white  Redeemers  and pro business Bourbon Democrats  Until the 1868 presidential election  South Carolina s legislature  not the voters  chose the state s electors for the presidential election  South Carolina was the last state to choose its electors in this manner  On October 19  1871 President Ulysses S  Grant suspended habeas corpus in nine South Carolina counties under the authority of the Ku Klux Klan Act  20  Led by Grant s Attorney General Amos T  Akerman  hundreds of Klansmen were arrested while 2000 Klansmen fled the state  20  This was done in order to suppress Klan violence against African American and white voters in the South  20   edit  Populist and Agrarian movements The state became a hotbed of racial and economic tensions during the Populist and Agrarian movements of the 1890s  Passage of the new conservative constitution of 1895 meant that almost all blacks and many poor whites were effectively disfranchised by new requirements for poll taxes  residency and literacy tests  By 1896  only 5 500 black voters remained on the registration rolls  21  The 1900 census demonstrated the extent of disfranchisement  African Americans comprised more than 58  of the state s population  but their total of 782 509 citizens was essentially without any political representation  22  Pitchfork Ben Tillman  controlled state politics from the 1890s to 1910 with a base among poor white farmers   edit  Women s suffrage South Carolina was one of several states that initially rejected the Nineteenth Amendment  The South Carolina legislature later ratified the amendment on July 1  1969   edit  20th century and beyond Early in the 20th century  South Carolina developed a thriving textile industry  The state also converted its agricultural base from cotton to more profitable crops  attracted large military bases  and created tourism industries  Of extended controversy has been the state s display of the flags of the Confederate States of America  which was raised on the state capitol in 1962  The state capital is located directly next to the University of South Carolina campus  a move seen as a protest against the court ordered desegregation of the schools  23  24  A lawsuit calling for the flag to be removed was filed in 1994  25  On July 1  2000  South Carolina became the last state to remove the Confederate flag  placed there in 1962  during Democratic Governor Fritz Hollings term in office  from over its statehouse  The state Senate had approved a bill for its removal on April 12  2000  by a margin of 36 to 7  the bill had specified that a Confederate flag be flown in front of the Capitol next to a monument honoring fallen Confederate soldiers  Debate was more heated in the state House of Representatives  which passed the bill on May 18  2000  by a margin of only 66 to 43  after including a measure s ensuring that the Confederate flag by the monument be 30 feet  9 1 m  high  26  The flag by the monument continues to fuel a cause for controversy  by the NAACP  The NAACP maintains an economic boycott of the state of South Carolina  The NCAA refuses to allow South Carolina to host NCAA athletic events whose locations are determined in advance  On July 6  2009  the Atlantic Coast Conference announced a decision to move three future baseball tournaments out of South Carolina  citing concerns by the NAACP over the continuing state sponsored display of the Confederate flag  27
