Chris Claremont and John Byrne  Sabretooth was initially conceived as a recurring antagonist for Iron Fist  whom he fought several times  He worked for a time with the Constrictor as a partner in crime  and both clashed repeatedly with Iron Fist and Power Man  3  4  Sabretooth then became one of Marvel Comics  numerous semi recurring villains  occasionally clashing with various superheroes such as Spider Man  The character rose to prominence when Chris Claremont introduced him as an enemy for the X Men  during the Mutant Massacre crossover in 1986  Sabretooth became one of Marvel s major recurring supervillains and was depicted in particular as a recurring antagonist of Wolverine  Sabretooth has also been featured in limited series and one shot comics including Sabretooth and Mystique and Sabretooth  In The Red Zone   edit  Origin Chris Claremont had meant for Sabretooth to be Wolverine s father  though this was disproved by subsequent writers  Claremont  when asked what he had intended to be the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth  stated   Father and son  That s why Sabretooth always considered Logan  sloppy seconds  to his  original     real deal   The other critical element in my presentation of their relationship was that  in their whole life  Logan has never defeated Sabretooth in a knock down  drag out  kill or be killed berserker fight  By the same token  on every one of his birthdays  Sabretooth has always managed to find him  no matter where Logan was or what he was doing  and come within an inch of killing him  For no other reason than to remind him that he could   5  In Wolverine vol  2  42  genetic tests performed by S H I E L D  confirmed that Sabretooth and Wolverine were not father and son  An interviewer asked Paul Jenkins if Dog Logan  a character from Wolverine s early life  from the limited series Origin was Sabretooth  Paul Jenkins said he had not intended it to be him  but said he would not have a problem with another writer doing it later  6  7   edit  X Men Forever In X Men Forever  Chris Claremont s continuation of his run on X Men  non canonical to the mainstream timeline and taking place in the 161 Marvel Universe   Sabretooth is established as Wolverine s father  He attacks the X Mansion  but is blinded by Storm  8  Claremont has stated in an interview that in X Men Forever the original true Sabretooth makes his reappearance after a long time  and that most of the previous appearances of Sabretooth prior to X Men Forever  2  that follows directly after X Men vol  2  3  were that of a weaker Sabretooth clone created by Mister Sinister  The original true Sabretooth reappears dressed in the Jim Lee costume in X Men Forever  which would make the weaker clone the one dressed in the John Byrne costume  Claremont apparently always meant for the Sabretooth dressed in the Byrne costume to be later outed as a clone of the original true Sabretooth  Claremont on Sabretooth   Speaking specifically of the cast of X Men Forever  one character who s becoming more enticing is Sabretooth  in part because  at least as it relates to my conception of him  very little is actually known  At this specific point of his life  readers haven t really seen that much of him over the years  since the Sabes that s shown up most over the time is a less endowed copy cloned from spare cells by Mr  Sinister   9   edit  Fictional character biography  edit  Early life Sabretooth s name  or what is believed to be his real name  is Victor Creed  10  Sabretooth s memories have been tampered with by

eyes has followed Creed ever since  Ultimately  Sabretooth attacks Charles Xavier  leader of the X Men  As Xavier infiltrates Creed s mind  he discovers that every victim Sabretooth has killed is remembered by the villain  Xavier is confident this means Creed values human life  and there is hope for the mutant  Sabretooth is incarcerated  as a wanted murderer  in a holographic environment because Xavier does not want him to roam on the grounds  Sabretooth is angered  but grudgingly stays with the team  During his incarceration  he assists in battles against the X Cutioner and the Phalanx  Caliban  free of Apocalypse s control  kidnaps the X Man Jubilee in exchange for Sabretooth  When Sabretooth arrives  he mauls Caliban s face  and Caliban flees the battle  Wolverine  who had left the team after his adamantium was removed by Magneto  returns  and the villain escapes for a fight  This leads to Wolverine stabbing one of his claws into Sabretooth s brain  33  The newer  gentler Sabretooth was frequently nursed by X Force member Boomer  he eventually reveals that he was feigning helplessness  and attacks Boomer  Psylocke saves the young mutant s life  and she uses her psionic knife to disable him  However  this no longer works because his brain injury from Wolverine freed Sabretooth from the need for  the glow   furthermore rendering him resistant to telepathic detection and control  Retaliating  Sabretooth nearly killed Psylocke  but he is finally confronted by the X Men  who manage to incapacitate him  34  He is turned over to the custody of Dr  Valerie

mission of executing X Factor members the government could not control  He eventually escapes  and returns once more to mercenary work  Under unknown circumstances he gains adamantium skeleton and claws  Sabretooth was eventually captured  along with his long time rival Wolverine  by Apocalypse  who forced the two feral mutants to fight once more  Wolverine triumphs after learning that the winner of the fight would become Apocalypse s new Horseman  Death  After Sabretooth s defeat  Apocalypse takes the adamantium from him and bonds it to Wolverine  volume  amp  issue needed  Sabretooth then joins Mystique s new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants  calling itself the Brotherhood  where he participates in an assassination attempt against Senator Robert Kelly  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Weapon X and the Brotherhood Later  he is forced to become a member of a relaunched Weapon X program  where his skeleton is infused with adamantium once more  In Wolverine vol  2  166  Sabretooth reveals that by means of genetic enhancement the Weapon X program has increased his strength and accelerated his healing factor  Eventually he escaped the program again and resumed working solo  However  he sometimes worked on a team  such as when he worked with several other villains to locate the Identity Disc  a record of heroes  secret identities  This ended up being a ruse  Later  in Canada  he encountered Sasquatch and the newest Wendigo  Sasquatch believes Creed may be responsible for some of the human deaths occurring there  Creed is seen setting traps and acting mysteriously  Sasquatch discovers Sabretooth is playing a twisted mind game with the Wendigo before attempting to kill it  Sabretooth and the Wendigo fall into the Arctic Sea with Sabretooth biting the Wendigo s neck  and both are presumed dead by Sasquatch  After a fearsome battle in the arctic waters  Sabretooth emerged victorious with the hide of the Wendigo  Sabretooth would later attack the Xavier Institute  in a revamped Brotherhood consisting of leader Black Tom Cassidy  Mammomax  Avalanche  Exodus  and undercover heroes Nocturne and Juggernaut  Wolverine claims to have killed Sabretooth  spreading him  all over the grass   although Black Tom s plant abilities probably contributed to Sabretooth s survival  he returns in X Men  The 198 Files   edit  Reluctant alliance with the X Men Promotional art for X Men vol  2  189  September 2006   Art by Chris Bachalo and Tim Townsend  In X Men vol  2  188  August 2006   Sabretooth was spotted fleeing a mysterious group of superhumans collectively known as The Children  Their reasons for pursuing him remained unknown  but two of them Sangre and Serafina were tracking him  Sangre activated a singularity generator that annihilated most of the town and killed all its citizens  except for a little girl whom Serafina deliberately shielded from the destruction so there would be a witness to what had happened  He later encountered two more of the Children Aguja and Fuego  They attacked him and temporarily neutralized his healing factor  but he managed to escape regardless  only to end up at the Xavier Institute later that night seeking sanctuary  It is revealed that the Children are after Creed because he has seen them and knows who they are  while the public believed the X Men destroyed the town  It is only when Rogue  the leader of the team  injected Nano Sentinels into Sabretooth s blood that they take him along with their fight against the Children  a factor that one of the Children exploited  At one point  Cannonball saved his life during the battle  Sabretooth rewards him with some inside information   The first time you turn your back  you re dead   Following the incident on Providence  Creed escaped the X Men  but was hurled into the middle of the Pacific Ocean by Cable  Writer Mike Carey noted he has no plans on redeeming Sabretooth  saying   I m not going to try and show a heroic side to Sabretooth s nature  I m not going to retcon him so that there are reasons for his actions that make him forgivable  The things he s done are not forgivable and he can t be redeemed  I m not making him into a hero  I m making him into a team member and there are reasons within the first storyline as to why he ends up fighting alongside the X Men against another enemy  And there are reasons why it s not so easy to simply shake him off again afterwards  There are things that are going on that will sort of unfold during the first year of my run which explain his being there and explain his being accepted with very  very grave misgivings into the team   35   edit  Death Sabretooth renews his rivalry with Wolverine following the latter s return to the X Mansion  A fight soon breaks out with Wolverine tossing Sabretooth through a window  During the fight  Wolverine thinks back to the time when Sabretooth had  supposedly  killed Silver Fox  He remembers Sabretooth saying   quod sum eris  and asks what it means  Sabretooth explains that it means  I am what you will be   Wolverine loses control and calls Sabretooth insane before placing his fist against Sabretooth s throat  Creed tells him if he extracts his claws  he will rip his heart out  Wolverine replies   Let  er rip   and pops his claws into Sabretooth s throat  36  Wolverine later regains consciousness and finds himself chained to the roof of the Blackbird  He quickly breaks free of the chains and is surprised to find Sabretooth piloting the jet  Wolverine breaks into the cockpit and begins choking Sabretooth with one of the chains and causes him to crash  The two emerge from the flaming wreckage and  while healing from the injuries sustained in the crash  begin fighting once again until separated by a lightning bolt  courtesy of Wolverine s former teammate and current Queen of Wakanda  Storm  37  A short time later Sabretooth is chained up in the royal palace of Wakanda and complains to Wolverine  Storm  and the Black Panther  Sabretooth snaps the chains and escapes into the jungle  with the Black Panther quickly giving chase  The Black Panther catches up to him and the two begin to fight  with Sabretooth quickly gaining the upper hand  He holds the Black Panther off the ground by the neck  preparing to strike a killing blow  when Wolverine suddenly appears and slices off Sabretooth s right hand  38  Once the fight between the Black Panther and Sabretooth is broken up by Wolverine  Sabretooth is brought back to the Wakandan Palace and placed in a vibranium holding cell and guarded around the clock  The battle scene between the Black Panther and Sabretooth then becomes the focus of why Wolverine was brought to the palace in the first place  It seems that amongst the bones from an elephant graveyard  there are also some unidentified skeletal remains of another offshoot of Homo sapiens called  Lupus sapiens   The Black Panther and Wolverine are discussing that instead of there being one evolutionary path between humans and monkeys  that there may also have been one that developed from lupines  It is believed at this point that Romulus is the first of this race  and it is revealed that he has been the one behind Daken s attacks  and the driving force behind the Weapon X program  After the discussion with the Black Panther  Wolverine is awakened by the stench of blood from something that has a scent similar to his and Sabretooth s and also something else  It turns out to be an enhanced Wild Child who has now surpassed the abilities of both Wolverine and Sabretooth  thanks to Romulus  Wild Child strikes Wolverine with poison tipped claws and incapacitates him for two days  When Wolverine awakens  he finds Sasquatch  Wolfsbane  and Feral and her sister Thornn ready to go back with him to the Weapon X complex so that they might get to the bottom of this lupine mystery  volume  amp  issue needed  Once they all arrive at the Weapon X facility  Wolverine is plagued by memories that seem to mix past and present together and all of them controlled by Romulus  Wolverine goes in alone telling the others to stay put on the plane  but they do not listen  Feral and Thornn  who were granted their lupine appearance back by Romulus  are separated and Sabretooth  reduced to his animalistic state  has gutted Feral and she is dying  Wolverine gets Feral back to the ship and finds that Thornn and Wolfsbane are in shock from the encounter  along with Sasquatch having been incapacitated by Wild Child  Once they are on their way  Wolverine goes back to the Xavier Institute and asks Cyclops to give him back the Muramasa sword  which he gave to Scott in case he was too out of control and needed to be put down for good  Cyclops only does this after Emma Frost reads Wolverine s mind and sees the horrors that Wolverine has been witnessing when he dreams  the horrors committed by Victor Creed throughout the years  Sword in hand  Wolverine then sets out to find and kill Sabretooth once and for all  39  After the events in  Evolution   Wolverine has been waiting for an unspecified length of time at Silver Fox s cabin in the Canadian wilderness  Sabretooth finally shows up and immediately attacks him  In the ensuing battle Wolverine cuts off Sabretooth s right arm with the Muramasa  Sabretooth  still in his animalistic state tries to re attach his arm allowing his healing factor to kick in  but it does not work  Wolverine explains to a bewildered Creed that it is because the sword interrupts the healing factor and that he has to finally kill Sabretooth for what he s done  Managing to regain control and speak between grunts  Sabretooth tells him   Do it   Wolverine then decapitates Sabretooth  finally putting an end to his long time enemy  Logan then walks away  leaving both Creed s body and head in the snow to rot  39   edit  Hell Sabretooth appears to Wolverine  leashed and under the control of the Devil himself  who has claimed to have broken Victor s will  40  Victor shows defiance by striking the face of his defeated master after Wolverine uses his broken bone claws to pin Satan to a wall  41  After Wolverine has an interrupted discussion with his father  it is shown that Victor wields Satan s sword  which is being held as a symbol of who is the ruler of Hell  Wolverine fights Victor again mentioning as he beheads him once more  that there s no coming back when you re killed by the sword  Wolverine leaves Victor s beheaded soul lying in the pit of Hell  42   edit  Return Sabretooth returns in Wolverine  20 and Wolverine and the X Men  3  both released the same day   He is partly responsible for starting a war between The Hand and The Yakuza  He will play a big part in Wolverine  300  citation needed   edit  Powers and abilities Sabretooth using his tracking skills to find Wolverine  Sabretooth was a mutant with a number of natural mutant powers and artificial improvements to his physiology  His primary mutant power was an accelerated healing ability that allowed him to regenerate damaged or destroyed areas of his body and cellular structure far beyond the capabilities of an ordinary human  He could regenerate organs such as missing eyes and large portions of flesh  Sabretooth s natural mutant attributes stemmed from  at least partially  his accelerated healing factor  This  healing factor  also granted him virtual immunity to poisons  most drugs  toxins  and diseases  and limited immunity to the fatigue poisons generated by his own body  43  The unique regenerative qualities of his healing powers and  age suppression factor   Sabretooth s natural aging process  caused him to age at an unusually slow rate  While he was of an unknown advanced age  Sabretooth had the appearance and vitality of a man in his physical prime  The depiction of Sabretooth s powers has evolved with his treatments by various writers  His healing power  in particular  was introduced as a retcon  When he became Wolverine s frequent antagonist  Sabretooth started being depicted as possessing a healing factor comparable to his foe s  In other  earlier appearances  Sabretooth was not depicted as possessing such a power  In The Spectacular Spider Man vol  1  116  he was incapacitated when his face was severely wounded  and did not display any accelerated healing ability  In issue  119 of The Spectacular Spider Man  a still badly scarred Sabretooth returned  and his wounds reopened when he was hit in the face by the Black Cat  Sabretooth possessed superhumanly acute senses that were comparable to those possessed by certain animals  Sabretooth was able to see objects with greater clarity and at much greater distances than an ordinary human  His sight was enhanced to the point that he could see with this same level of clarity in almost complete darkness  just like a nocturnal cat  This may have been in part a result of being able to see into the infrared and ultraviolet portions of the spectrum  44  His sense of hearing was enhanced in a similar manner  allowing him to hear sounds that humans could not  Sabretooth was able to use his highly developed sense of smell to track targets by scent  He was able to track targets with an impressive degree of success  even if the scent had been eroded by natural factors such as weather conditions  His sense of taste was also developed to superhuman levels  Many of Sabretooth s natural physical attributes were beyond human levels  He possessed some degree of superhuman strength  able to lift heavy objects without breaking his bones  due to his healing factor   The exact limits of his strength are unknown  but he was seemingly stronger than Wolverine  Originally  he could crush an iron barbell with ease  45  Sabretooth s physical strength had been artificially enhanced at least twice  Sabretooth received his first strength enhancement from his now deceased son  Graydon Creed  46  Sabretooth s strength was further enhanced later after joining the latest incarnation of the Weapon X Program  47  His mutant healing factor granted him superhuman stamina  He could push himself at peak capacity for several days before fatigue began to affect him  43  His agility and reflexes were enhanced beyond the human body s natural limits  With an ability to flex  relax  and reflex his musculature at dramatically improved speeds  Sabretooth s pounce could be devastating  As depicted in both movies and comics throughout his appearances  most enemies could not react to his leap before being hit  48  Combined with the ability to stalk  move quietly  and see in the dark it provided him with initiative in a fight  Even Wolverine s instincts were incapable of countering this effect fully  although he is frequently depicted smelling Sabretooth just before taking a painful strike   citation needed  Sabretooth s physical appearance also displayed animal like mutations  including sharper than normal teeth with two pronounced canines and retractable claws 43  where ordinary humans have fingernails and toenails  He also was portrayed to have thick  bushy eyebrows  which gave him an animal like appearance as well  11  His eyes were supposed to be depicted as amber without visible pupils  as this was noted by the Foreigner as something that caused him to stand out  volume  amp  issue needed  However  colorists also depicted his eyes with red  blue  grey  brown  or hazel irises  citation needed  His teeth and claws  even before being laced with adamantium  were strong enough to rend substances as durable as steel  Later  just prior to Wolverine s marriage to Viper  Sabretooth s skeleton and claws were molecularly laced with the indestructible metal adamantium by Apocalypse  49  who later removed it and bonded it to Wolverine s bones  50  Later  the Weapon X program bonded adamantium to his bones once more  51  However  Sabretooth did not have adamantium connective tissues in his joints and wrists  only adamantium bones  therefore his limbs could be severed  43  According to the official Marvel Comics website  Sabretooth still possessed an adamantium skeleton  Even without the adamantium enhanced edge  Sabretooth s claws were capable of cutting most conventional materials including flesh  bone  wood  stone  and some types of metals   edit  Skills Sabretooth was an excellent hand to hand combatant  having been trained by various organizations such as the CIA  Weapon X  the Foreigner  and HYDRA  He was also an expert hunter and tracker  even without the use of his heightened senses  Sabretooth also developed a high resistance to telepathic probing and manipulation  after an incident in which Wolverine stabbed him under the chin with a claw  and punctured his brain  citation needed  Although his extreme arrogance and bestial nature gave him the appearance of stupidity  he was actually quite intelligent  He routinely hacked into government databases to steal classified information citation needed  and had escaped the highest levels of incarceration  He is also quite skilled at psychological manipulation   edit  Other versions  edit  Age of Apocalypse and the Exiles In an alternate universe in Marvel Comics depicted in the  Age of Apocalypse  storyline there is a vastly different version of Sabretooth  This version of the character has the same origin as the one in the normal continuity  but has a different moral alignment  He is actually one of the X Men and a role model for other mutants in this alternate reality  This Sabretooth was initially a villain  having been recruited by Apocalypse  but he was cast out as a traitor when he expressed moral reservations about using nuclear weapons to wipe out the world s human population  Apocalypse intended to kill Sabretooth alongside the X Men  but was thwarted by Magneto  Sabretooth came back into Apocalypse s fold and took part in a number of culls  but he eventually grew disgusted by his life and rebelled against Holocaust  for which he was imprisoned alongside the feral Wild Child  Instead of becoming a feral killer  like Holocaust intended  Sabretooth defeated Wild Child and became his master and protector  Together  the two escaped and joined the X Men afterward  52  He became a hero and an ally of Logan  Weapon X   and even adopted a young girl  Blink  as his daughter  In the Exiles comics  he spent decades in an alternate dimension raising mutant children  attempting to teach them ethics and tolerance  without incident  53  Also  this version of Sabretooth s biological son was theorized to be Nightcrawler  evidenced by the statement of Mystique that she had gone to the trouble of  finding a father with fur  when Nightcrawler complains he is cold and  when the Shadow King possesses Mystique  the captions reveal  one memory is more interesting then the others  and flashes to Sabretooth taunting Nightcrawler  54  When the  Age of Apocalypse  timeline was apparently destroyed  Sabretooth became the leader of the extra dimensional band of characters who slide into alternate realities  known as Weapon X  For a time he was also the leader of their counterpart team  the Exiles  and remains with the team to this day  This version of Sabretooth originally had no adamantium in his skeleton  though it was later revealed that his skeleton had become laced with adamantium like Wolverine   but was still superhumanly strong and possessed a regenerative healing factor   55  When Sabretooth decided to leave Weapon X  he stayed behind in a dimension to ensure that that reality s version of David Richards  the son of Franklin Richards and Rachel Summers  would not be corrupted by his virtually omnipotent powers  However  the boy turned evil anyway  despite Sabretooth s best efforts at raising him right  56  When he was recruited by the Timebroker into the Exiles  Blink s personality became incredibly docile and subservient to Creed

clashes with Sabretooth  thinking him to be the Earth 616 Sabretooth that nearly killed her twice  They fight for a while  but eventually Psylocke catches on to the fact that Sabretooth is not there for a fight and Morph intervenes and makes an introduction  Surprisingly  Psylocke cannot be detected by any of Panoptichron s cameras  59  Heather teleports Morph  Sabretooth  and Psylocke down to Earth 1720 to save the other Exiles  who are beaten or brainwashed  courtesy of this world s Madame Hydra  Sue Storm  He and the other Exiles save their brainwashed friends after fighting them  60  Sabretooth then returns to an empty Panoptichron  He and Psylocke have been getting closer since their fight  It was later revealed on their first mission of the Exiles with Sabretooth as the new team leader  that his skeleton was now laced with adamantium  though exactly how this happened has yet to be revealed  as he never been previously shown to have had any such enhancements  volume  amp

the Earth 616 version of Sabretooth  having accelerated healing and keen senses  with the exception that he has four adamantium claws surgically implanted in his arms in an attempt to one up Wolverine after having many failures in the service of Weapon X  One of the adamantium claws implanted in his left forearm is broken  69  Exactly how and when this occurred has not been revealed  He has a burning hatred for Wolverine and also  as he stated in his encounter with him at Weapon X  for the primitive Homo sapiens  He feels that his cruel  psychopathic nature was merely a natural part of being a mutant  When Magneto attempted to destroy the world so that he could eradicate humans  Sabretooth asked him to kill as few animals as possible  He cruelly boasts of murdering Wolverine s wife and child  and then commenced battle with him outside the Weapon X compound  He initially had the upper hand  but Wolverine managed to score a critical hit  a stab to Sabretooth s groin  before driving him off the edge of a cliff  Following Sabretooth s loss to Wolverine  the Weapon X program was dismantled with Colonel Wraith being shot dead by Nick Fury  Sabretooth did not die from his encounter with Wolverine  but rather returned as a high ranking follower to Magneto in the Brotherhood of Mutants  His encounter with Wolverine while with the Brotherhood was his final underestimation of his old enemy  After boasting that he can survive any wound or injury  and would always return to fight and haunt Wolverine  Wolverine gives a vicious retort  he decapitates Sabretooth on the spot  although the panel was partially covered  so that the full effect of the injury was not visible  Sabretooth was long thought dead until he resurfaces one night when Wolverine and Storm were leaving Nowhere Special  a pool hall   He is alive and well sporting a new scar around his neck  apparently from the decapitation he received from Wolverine when they last met  Sabretooth explains that his head had remained partially attached to his body via strands of tissue and blood vessels  which allowed him to survive in a comatose state while his body regenerated  He also made one startling revelation  Wolverine is his biological father  Sabretooth then attempts to obtain a tissue sample so that Dr  Cornelius can clone a new Wolverine  During the beginning of the  Aftermath  arc  Sabretooth tells Wolverine that he is Wolverine s son  He also wants to help Wolverine search for his wife  Sabretooth s mother  although Wolverine claims that his scent proves that this is not true  70  Sabretooth made a one panel cameo in the  Magical  arc  standing outside the Xavier Institute while hiding behind a tree  with a look of sorrow on his face  In Ultimates 3 71  and Ultimatum  Sabretooth is shown to use his claws as weapons  like the main Marvel Universe version of Sabretooth  instead of his four adamantium claws  No canon explanation has been given for this change
