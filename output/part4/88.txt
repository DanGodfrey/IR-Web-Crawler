Aye   mine  All that might  all that destructive force  mine to command  Channeled and guided through the mystic might of this hammer  guided right at thee     Thor   Thor is the blood son of Odin  All Father of the Asgardians  and Jord  who was also known as Gaea  the elder goddess of the Earth  Odin sought to father a son whose power would derive from Earth as well as Asgard  and hence he sought to mate with Jord  Odin created a cave in Norway where Jord gave birth to Thor  1  Months after the infant Thor was weaned  Odin brought him to Asgard to be raised  Odin s wife  the goddess Frigga  acted as Thor s mother from that time onward  Not until recent years did Thor learn that Jord was his actual mother  Ragnarok Cycle The Ragnarok cycle created numerous versions of Thor s origin story  and the fact that Asgard was a place of myth did not help matters when trying to keep track of all of the different stories and personalized descriptions of events  One such story came from the severed eye of Odin  which grew to great size  achieved sentience  and told Thor of another Thor who had existed before the current Thor s birth  This previous Thor was also the son of Odin  but had red hair  not blond hair like the current Thor  Thor was said in myth to have killed the Midgard Serpent  and to have been killed himself by the dying monster s venom  at Ragnarok  the destruction of a previous version of Asgard  Odin himself was killed  but a new Odin appeared in the place of several gods who survived Ragnarok  and it was this new Odin who fathered the current version of Thor  Whether a true picture of Thor s origin will ever be told  we will never know  Early Life The young Thor was raised alongside Loki  who had been adopted by Odin after Loki s father  the Frost Giant Laufey  had been killed in battle  For all of their childhood  Loki was jealous of Thor  Loki s jealousy  which grew to hatred  resulted in a desire to kill Thor  Thus began Loki s enmity for Thor  which persisted for centuries  For example  when Thor was eight  Odin sent him to Nidavellir  the land of the dwarfs  to bid the dwarfs Brokk and Eitri to create three treasures for Asgard s ruler  Among the three treasures that Brokk and Eitri created was the Uru hammer Mjolnir  although Loki sabotaged the creation of the hammer so that its handle was made too short   Odin bestowed various enchantments upon the hammer  including one that made it impossible for anyone to lift it except someone who was truly worthy of wielding it  Odin then declared that he was reserving the use of Mjolnir for Thor  who would receive it on the day that great deeds of selfless valor had proved him worthy of it   Many of the stories contradict each other  This story of the origin of Mjolnir was contradicted by another story that showed Odin wielding Mjolnir before Thor was born   For years  Thor strove to become physically strong enough to wield the hammer  and was responsible for many heroic deeds  Finally  when Thor was sixteen  Odin sent him and his friends Balder and Sif on a quest to teach him what was truly required to wield Mjolnir  a pure heart  Slaying A Frost Giant Added by Govven1 Thor became Asgard s greatest warrior  Before Thor was twenty  he had fallen in love with the goddess Sif  This romance waxed and waned over the centuries  Sometime in the 9th Century AD  Thor traveled to Earth to promote his worship among the Vikings  Both the Norsemen and the Germans  who called him Donner   Thunder    came to worship Thor and other Asgardians  Thor actively encouraged the adulation of his Viking worshipers for years  and also encouraged them to find glory in battle  But finally  Thor discovered that a part of his Viking worshipers had slaughtered the inhabitants of a Christian monastery  Shocked  realizing that some of his more zealous worshipers were committing atrocities like this one in his name  Thor withdrew from Earthly activities altogether  and the active worship of the gods of Asgard ended  According to the severed eye of Odin  Odin himself later caused Thor to live on Earth in the mortal guises of the Germanic heroes Siegmund and his son  Siegfried  In these two roles  Thor played a major role in Odin s efforts to regain the dangerously powerful Ring of the Nibelung  The warrior Hunding killed Siegmund  but Thor was reborn as Siegfried  the son of Siegmund and his lover Sieglinda  Siegfried took possession of the Ring after killing the giant Fafnir  who guarded it in the guise of a dragon  this Fafnir is not to be confused with the former king of Nastrond   Siegfried then fell in love with the Valkyrie Brunnhilde  but was murdered by Hagen  the son of Alberich  the dwarf who had created the Ring and placed a curse upon it  Odin  however  resurrected Siegfried as Thor  who again had his full godly powers  but wiped out Thor s memory of his two mortal identities   It is unclear how much  if any  of this account by Odin s severed eye is true   World War II Main article  World War II At one point  Adolf Hitler succeeded in contacting Thor and deceived him into aiding the cause of the Germans  the descendants of the people who had once worshiped him  in the current war  Thor therefore clashed with the Invaders and nearly killed the second Union Jack with a blast of lightning from his enchanted hammer  Learning that Hitler was evil  Thor vowed to aid him no more  and withdrew most of the electricity in Union Jack s body back into his hammer  somehow restoring him to health in the process  The second Union Jack now possessed the superhuman power to discharge electrical bolts from his body  Thor led an active  adventurous life in Asgard  doing battle with Frost Giants and other enemies of the realm  Odin watched Thor become more and more arrogant  and sent him to Midgard several times to learn humility  Over the years  Odin grew increasingly dissatisfied with Thor s headstrong behavior and excessive pride  On one occasion Thor violated a truce between the Asgardians and the Frost Giants  thereby nearly starting a war  Finally  while Thor was engaged in a brawl in an Asgardian tavern  Odin summoned him to his presence  Modern Age Thor the God of Thunder Added by Govven1 Odin decided that it was time Thor learned humility  Odin had Thor surrender his hammer to him  and then sent him to Earth in the mortal guise of a crippled young medical student named Donald Blake  stripped of his memory  again  of his true identity  As Blake  Thor learned the value of humble perseverance in dealing with his injured leg  and he came to care for the sick and dying  first as a medical student  and later as a successful physician  After leaving medical school  Blake opened a private practice in New York  and quickly gained renown as a great surgeon  After Thor had spent ten years in the role of Blake  Odin planted within Blake s mind the suggestion to take a vacation in Norway  There Blake encountered a party of alien Kronans  also known as the Stone Men from Saturn  Blake fled from the Kronans into a cavern  the very same one that had served as Thor s birthplace millennia ago  where Odin had left Thor s hammer in the enchanted form of a wooden cane  Trapped in the cavern by a great boulder  Blake struck the boulder with the cane in frustrated anger  and was transformed back into his true godly form of Thor  As Thor he escaped the cavern and drove off the Kronans 2   At first Thor still had no memory of his past life as an Asgardian god  although as months passed  more of his memories returned  Finally  a few years later  Odin revealed to him the false nature of the Blake identity and the reason for it  Thor maintained his Blake identity on Earth and continued his medical practice  Part of his affinity for Earth was his subconscious realization that his maternal heritage was on this world  The other part was simply his love for humanity and his need to experience those things that only mortals could know  Thor came to divide his time between Earth and Asgard  and does so to this day  For years  Thor was in love with Jane Foster  who worked as a nurse for Blake  Odin disapproved of Thor s love for this mortal 3   but eventually the romance between Thor and Foster came to an end  and Thor renewed his past relationship with Sif  That relationship suffered strains in recent years  and it is unclear what path it may take in the future  When Loki s manipulations forced several of earth s mightiest heroes to band together to stop the Hulk  Thor was amongst them and became a founding member of the team of superhuman champions known as the Avengers 4   He continued to serve with the team from time to time through the present  Thor gave up his identity as Don Blake  In fact  Odin transferred the enchantment enabling Thor to change into mortal form and back from Mjolnir to that of his ally and alien counterpart  Beta Ray Bill  With the aid of Nick Fury  Public Director of SHIELD  Thor adopted a new  secret identity   that of construction worker  Sigurd Jarlson  In this identity  Thor did not actually become mortal in his Jarlson identity  he simply dressed as a normal contemporary Earthman and wore glasses  Thor grew a beard to conceal the terrible scars left on his face due to wounds inflicted by the Asgardian death goddess Hela  Hela later healed the scars on his face and Thor shaved himself smooth again  After Odin disappeared during his battle with Surtur  the people of Asgard wished to make Thor  Odin s designated heir  their new ruler  Unwilling to give up his guardianship of Earth or his life of adventure  at least not yet  Thor declined the offer and instead nominated his half brother Balder the Brave to be Asgard s ruler  Balder ruled until Odin returned and reclaimed the throne  For a time  Thor was merged with the human Eric Masterson  an architect who first met Thor as Jarlson  The two men would exchange bodies using Mjolnir  as Thor had done before as Blake  After Loki attempted to kill Susan Austin  the woman who cared for Eric s son  Thor became furious and slew Loki  As punishment he was exiled from Earth and Eric Masterson was given the thunder god s power to continue in the role of Thor  Eventually  after Loki reappeared  Eric was able to find Thor  who had been hidden within Eric s own sub consciousness  and rescued him from exile  Eric had proven himself to be a hero in his own right  and Odin rewarded him with the enchanted mace Thunderstrike  Taking Thunderstrike as his alias  Eric continued to serve as a hero on Earth until he died heroically after battling the Egyptian death god Seth  Thor grieved for Eric  who had been the closest friend he had made among humanity  Odin and Thor eventually learned that the constant shift of identity and sharing of power Odin had encouraged had driven Thor insane  marked by the appearance of a Valkyrie who was a manifestation of Thor s insanity  With the assistance of Adam Warlock and Doctor Strange  Thor regained his sanity  and Odin came to realize the error he had made  Once again attempting to thwart Ragnarok  Odin attempted to trick the world ash tree Yggdrasill into believing that Ragnarok had already happened  To do so  the Asgardians were to be transformed into mortals so that they would not be recognized as gods  Odin intended that Thor would restore the Asgardians to normal  but Seth accidentally prematurely activated the plan  Compounding the situation  Thor disappeared battling Onslaught and wound up on the new Counter Earth created by Franklin Richards  By the time Thor returned to Earth  the Asgardians had managed to regain their identities  but were then captured by the Dark Gods  Ultimately  Thor rescued his people from the Dark Gods with the aid of Hercules and the Destroyer  After a paramedic named Jake Olson was slain during a battle between the Avengers and the Destroyer  Marnot  a servant of Odin  gave Thor Olson s form as a new identity  Although Thor could assume Olson s form  he had none of Olson s memories and thus found this identity to be troublesome for him  He also re encountered Jane Foster while in this identity  and brief sparks were rekindled between them  Odin finally separated Olson from Thor  and Olson was allowed to return to his own life  After Odin fell in battle against Surtur  Asgard was left without a ruler  Thor eventually reluctantly accepted the throne and assumed his father s Odinpower  becoming much more powerful  Thor became determined to restore the gods of Asgard to their former place on Earth as beings to be worshiped  merging Earth with Asgard to accomplish this end  Thor s increased activity on Earth resulted in a resurgence of followers for the Asgardians  and a Church of Thor soon emerged  Thor s willingness to fight for the lives of his followers ultimately set him against his fellow Avengers when he attempted to overthrow the government of Slokovia  Thor Omnipotent Added by Govven1 Earth s citizens became increasingly wary of Thor  and the Consortium of Nations finally launched an assault upon Asgard that reduced it to rubble  From that point on  Thor devoted himself to Earth s conquest to bring order to humanity  he ruled Earth for nearly two hundred years  In that time  he married the Enchantress and she bore him a son  Magni  Thor finally came to realize that he had done wrong  and used a device created by Zarrko to travel back in time and prevent Asgard s destruction  He re emerged as his younger self with Jake Olson  to ensure that Olson s humanity would prevent his future from occurring in that timeline  Returning Asgard to its own realm  Thor was faced with yet another Ragnarok threat when Loki teamed with Surtur using weapons created from the same forge from which Mjolnir was made  Determining that the gods above all gods known as Those Who Sit Above in Shadow had manipulated Asgard into the repeating cycle of Ragnarok  he sought them out and gave his life  and that of the reality of his dimensions  to destroy them  The Odinpower  having manifested itself as a young Asgardian  congratulated Thor on his final victory  the plan his father had always had for him  leaving Thor to rest the slumber of the gods and all that remained of them were memories on Midgard  Thor s Return Mjolnir returned to Earth  landing in a deserted field and inadvertently freeing Doctor Doom from his extra dimensional prison along the way  Donald Blake claimed the hammer  returned from oblivion after Odin s death and the breaking of the spell that undid his existence  Meanwhile  a clone of Thor  codenamed  Project Lightning  was also released during a battle between pro and anti registration heroes  To the shock of both sides  he killed Bill Foster during the fighting  Traveling back to  the void  Blake convinced Thor that he had ended the Ragnarok cycle  and that if he returned to earth  he could rebuild Asgard and restore his Asgardian friends and allies  Informing him that he could only return  with great pain   Thor was attacked by a horde of creatures  Disappearing  Donald Blake advised Thor that if he was to live again  he had to want to live again  Through the horde  Thor saw Mjolnir and reached for it  Grabbing it  a great bolt of lightning struck  throwing the horde clear of him  And Thor stood again  reborn in a new costume  Thor the God of Thunder Added by Govven1 Thor used Mjolnir to recreate Asgard s capital in Oklahoma  Soon afterward  Iron Man met Thor in New Orleans  He greeted Thor as a friend but explained that he couldn t just appear and recreate Asgard here on Earth  even though he did now own the land  Thor told Stark that he knew of the clone that he used and how violated he felt that he used such an abomination to wage war against other heroes  many of whom Thor considered as close as family  Seeking a compromise  Stark rationalized that Asgard could be considered a foreign embassy  with diplomatic immunity granted to its inhabitants  Thor deemed this acceptable  Soon after returning  Thor found the first of the lost Asgardians  Heimdall  and restored him to his true form  In Africa  Thor restored the Warriors Three to their true forms  Later  Thor attempted to free several captured Asgardians who were still trapped in mortal form from The Destroyer  He unknowingly freed Loki  reborn as a woman  who was working with Dr  Doom to allow Thor to free him from his mortal form  Although Thor successfully restored most of the Asgardians  he did not attempt to find his father  During the Odinsleep  Thor had a vision in which he discovered that on a subconscious level he did not do so because he wished to be free of his father  and that Odin fought an eternal cycle of battle with Surtur  dying and being reborn each day  between life and death  During the Skrull invasion  the Skrulls pulled Beta Ray Bill out of the limbo he had been trapped within  and enabled a Super Skrull to wield his mystic hammer Stormbreaker  Balder and Beta Ray Bill commanded the gods against the Skrull troops  Thor arrived  retrieved Stormbreaker  and collapsed all of Asgard itself on top of the Skrull  5  Thor flew to New York and joined with the gathered forces of nearly a hundred other superheroes to repel the Skrull attack  There  Thor was forced to sacrifice a fellow Avenger  the Wasp  when the Skrulls turned her into a last resort biological weapon that would have destroyed the planet  6 Thor the Lord of Asgard Added by Govven1 Loki traveled to the past  ensuring Bor  father of Odin and first king of Asgard  would perish in battle against the Frost Giants  In the present day Loki revived Bor in New York City and placed a spell on him to make him mistake everything around him for an enemy so he would attack everything in sight  including Thor  Sensing a portion of Odin s power inside what he saw as a demon  Bor attacked Thor  attempting to avenge his dead son  Thor was forced to kill Bor  fearing the entire planet could be destroyed in the wake of their battle  Loki reminded Balder the resurrected Bor was technically a king of Asgard when Thor killed him and the punishment for killing a king was banishment from Asgard  Balder was forced to agree and was made monarch in his place  After Thor s banishment  Loki made arrangements to have all Asgardians  but not Asgard itself  moved to Latveria at the invitation of Doctor Doom  7  Thor vs Bor Added by Matthew Stanley Feldman Thor vs Doom Added by Matthew Stanley Feldman With Mjolnir badly damaged from his battle with his revived grandfather  Thor was secluded from all but his own alter ego  Loki revealed that her female body had been meant for Sif and that the transfer from his female form to his male form would probably kill Sif s host  After seeking Doctor Strange s aid in healing Mjolnir by sacrificing the portion of the Odin Force  Thor managed to save Sif by freeing her spirit  Loki was returned to his male form  They deduced that Loki and Doom were working together and confronted Doom  Loki and their brethren  In the end  Doom was teleported away by Loki  Balder declared that the Asgardians were returning to Asgard  Thor vs Sentry Added by Matthew Stanley Feldman During The Siege of Asgard  Thor rushed to the aid of Asgard against Norman Osborn and his invading Dark Avengers  Osborn ordered the Sentry to destroy Asgard before the horrified eyes of Thor  The Sentry  then fully possessed by the Void  proceeded to pummel the heroes until Loki used the Norn Stones to empower them  Realizing that the heroes  power was coming from Loki  the Void attacked him  Loki s attempts to defend himself were unsuccessful  and he apologized to Thor before dying  Spurred on by unabridged rage  Thor struck the Void with a lightning blast  leaving nothing but a charred skeleton behind  Thor then wrapped his own cape around Sentry s corpse and disposed of it by throwing it into the sun  Balder lifted Thor s exile and appointed Thor as his adviser  Thor has since then rejoined the Avengers  Loki s Rebirth and Odin s Revival After the events of Siege  Asgard was left in ruins because of Loki s doing  still Thor mourned for him  After fighting the D sir and saving Hel  Thor asked Hela to speak with Loki only for Hela to tell him that her father did not dwell in Hel  In part of his deal to grant a piece of Hell for the dead  Loki had himself written out of the books of Hel  meaning his soul was out there  vulnerable to the Disir  Thor refused to believe it  knowing that his step brother would ve had something else planned  Thor meets the reborn Loki  Added by Kai Maciel As time went by and Asgard was rebuilt and Thor became more melancholic and saddened  Sorrowful  Thor admitted that he missed his brother who had made him laugh like no other and when they were children  Thor decided to bring him back against everyone s wishes and went looking for him  Thor found Loki in Paris  reborn as child with no memories of his past or his identity  living as a street hustler under the name of  Serrure   the French word for Lock   After chasing the boy  Thor told him that he was his brother and a God  and that  despite all his former villainy  Thor couln t imagine his current life without him and had come to bring Loki back home  Though Serrure was reluctant to believe him at first  the boy finally admitted that he couldn t remember anything about his past and even his name was fake  Crying  Serrure told Thor that he had dreams in which he had done horrible things and that he was scared that those were his memories  Thor told the child that everyone had done something they wish they could change in the past and that Loki should think of his amnesia as a  gift   Convinced  Serrure grabbed Mjolnir and turns back into Loki  though he remained in the form of a child without almost all his powers and memories and Thor brought his brother back to Asgard  When the World Eaters invaded the Nine Realms  Thor also brought Odin back to life  much to the latter exasperation who yelled at Loki  calling him a killer and an abomination responsible for Asgard s fall  scaring the boy away  Thor became angry with his father and calls him a  horrible  unlovable man  for screaming at a child who was very much the boy Odin had raised  The All Father  in turn  angrily told Thor that he had everything with both him and Loki dead but that he  just couldn t stand the quiet   Meanwhile  Loki had stolen Dr  Solvang s car and was caught by Iron Man  Though the boy tried to apologize Stark was about to attack him but Thor told his comrade to stop  admitting that he had indeed brought the God of Mischief back and that was all there was to say about his little brother  Even though Loki couldn t remember his past acts and had become a child completely  the Asgardians still hated and dispised him  bullying him mercilessly and even attempting on his life  The only one who protected him was Thor  telling his brother that things would get better and that trust would come along with affection  As a result  Loki came to idolize and deeply love his older brother  doing all he could to help him and trying to become a better person than he was in his previous life  Fear Itself Sometime after  Sin lifted a strange hammer in Antarctica and was transformed into Skadi  She then freed the enigmatic Serpent  who claimed to be the true All Father of Asgard  Sensing this  Odin retreated from Midgard  Thor objected and so was beaten into submission by Odin  Thor confronts the Serpent Added by Drakolord7 Odin recreated Asgard as a war world  intending to raze Midgard and defeat the Serpent once more  After escaping with Loki s help  Thor was banished back to Midgard  After a short reunion with the Avengers he set off to Antarctica  where the Serpent had recreated his dread citadel  He confronted the Serpent but was sent to New York  where he encountered Nul and Angrir  two of the Serpent s Worthy  He managed to defeat Angrir but had to knock Nul away due to exhaustion  He collapsed shortly after  The Avengers carried him to Asgard  where he healed and was given the Odinsword whose real name is Ragnarok to slay the Serpent  Arriving in Broxton  he was able to kill the Serpent  who took the form of a giant snake  but died as well fulfilling the prophecy  The Mighty Tanarus Thor s corpse was buried at Asgard  As his body burned  a shape was suddenly seen within the fire  and from the flames was born Tanarus  the loud mouthed  boisterous God of Thunder  both new hero and longtime Avenger  Welcomed by his teammates  only Loki seemed to notice that Tanarus had not always been around  At the same time  Thor s spirit awoke  Thor then found himself facing the Demogorge  Powers and AbilitiesEdit Powers Odin  the Skyfather of Asgard  said to the Earth Goddess Jord  also known as Gaea the Earthmother of Midgard   I seek an heir whose powers surpass Asgard   8  Biologically half Asgardian  half Elder God  Thor possesses a number of superhuman attributes common among the Asgardian and other gods  However  some are considerably more developed than those of the vast majority of his race  The Mighty Thor  the Norse God of Thunder is the most powerful being on the planet and one of the most powerful beings in the universe  Besides being the strongest man in creation  9 and durable enough to withstand a blast from Celestials  10  Thor also has energy manipulation powers that are on par with the Silver Surfer 11   and magical abilities that have been shown  on occasion  to be as powerful as those of Dr  Strange himself citation needed   He is also armed with Mjolnir  the mystical warhammer that has been shown to be capable of opening passageways through space and time 12   blocking all sorts of energy blasts  and bending the elements to its master s will  Thor has been shown to be able to swing Mjolnir at twice the speed of light 13   and this was never claimed to the fastest that Thor could swing it either   Thor is a Norse warrior god  trained and skilled in the arts of battle  and he s been doing it for countless ages  While Thor has usually been shown to rely solely on his fighting ability  super strength  and well nigh invulnerability  he has so many other options available to him if a fight starts going badly  He has complete mastery over the weather  he can open chasms in the earth  he can even drain the soul out of his opponent s body 14   or if worst comes to worst  use the dreaded Godblast  an attack that is so powerful that one time Mjolnir shatered from the amount of power Thor channeled  15  Thor has even broken through the armor of the Celestial Exitar in one blow  the force of it created a shock wave which rocked the planet Pangoria to its foundations  and was about to destroy it entirely if Thor hadn t acted  15  While on Earth  Thor greatly withholds his power unless fighting someone with similar strength and durability  16  Superhuman Strength  In addition to being the God of Thunder  Thor is also the Norse God of Strength  as such he is physically the strongest of the Norse gods 10  17  18  19  11  20  and one of the most powerful beings in the Universe  21  His strength has been called unlimited  9  His feats include easily lifting over a millions tons without any effort  22  crumbling Uru into dust  20  defeating and overpowering superhumans as strong and powerful as the Silver Surfer  Namor  Juggernaut  Hercules  the Hulk  the Red Hulk  the Sentry  and Gladiator in single combat  lifting the Midgard Serpent  23  who was large enough to coil around the Earth from head to tail multiple times over and crush it in its grip  17   overpowering cosmic entities when pressed in battle and physically destroying stars  planets  and moons with only his fists  24  25  Thor also possesses a magical belt that doubles his natural strength  Thor is also capable of entering into a state of Berserker Rage known as Warrior s Madness  which will temporarily increase his strength and stamina tenfold but will only do so in desperate situations because it threatens his sanity  26  27  28  29  Despite the fact that he always restrains and holds back his vast strength against mortals  he has been capable of stalemating an enraged Hulk in strength  depsite the fact that the Hulk was constantly increasing in strength every moment  for hours without tiring at all and while restraining himself as always  30  and knocking out the Hulk  31  How much strength Thor truly holds back against mortals is made clear  as he was capable of knocking out Namor with a single blow  despite Namor being fully hydrated and it was raining   32  easily defeating Bi Beast  whose strength is said to equal the Hulk s   33  easily overpower the Red Hulk  who killed the Abomination  overpowered the Hulk  punched and injuring Uatu  killed the Grandmaster  and was able to absorb the Power Cosmic   nearly rendering the Juggernaut uncouncious in under a minute after negating his mystical defenses  34  and defeated both the Thing and an enraged Hulk at once in unarmed combat using only his vast physical strength  35  Superhuman Stamina  Thor s advanced musculature is considerably more efficient than that of a human and most other Asgardians  His muscles produce no fatigue toxins during physical activity compared to those of humans and most other members of his race  His virtually inexhaustible stamina enables him to hold his breath for an undefined period of time and exert himself at peak capacity for months without tiring at all  Using the Belt of Strength also doubles his stamina  While in the Warrior s Madness  Thor s stamina also increases tenfold  36  27  Superhuman Senses  Thor s superhuman sense s allow him to effortlessly see objects as far out as the edge of the Solar System   37   allow him to track objects traveling faster than light   38 and hears cries from the otherside of the planet  39  Super Breath  Thor can use his breath to create hurricane level winds  12  Superhumanly Dense Tissue  Thor s skin  muscle  and bone tissues have several times the density of the same tissue in the body of a human being  contributing to his superhuman weight  He is invulnerable to powerful energy blasts  weighted impacts  falls from great heights  explosions and various other opposing forces  Self Sustenance  He is capable of surviving in the vacuum of space unaided and does not need air  food  water  or sleep  40  Godlike Invulnerability  Being a god whose heritage is half Asgardian  amp  half Elder God affords Thor absolute invulnerability and immunity to such human ailments as diseases  toxins  poisons  corrosives  fire  electrocution  asphyxiation  lead  and radiation poisoning  41  42  43  44  Thor can drink mead all day long and not get drunk  He has withstood direct blows from beings with vast superhuman strength such as the Hulk  Hercules  Gladiator  Silver Surfer  Thanos  and the Red hulk  Thor can survive in the heart of the Sun with no discomfort  45  has flown through the heart of stars  46  and survived point blank energy explosions capable of destroying entire planets  47  He has survived a supernova blast of an exploding star unharmed  9  the gravity of a Neutron Star  47  and withstood the weight of a score of entire planets  48  Thor was able to survive direct multiple blasts from the Asgardian Detroyer  the weapon created by Odin and the gods from multiple pantheons to battle the Celestials   49  Thor also once took a glancing hit by a Doomsday Bomb that was capable of destroying an entire planet  and soon after that explosion he fell from space  leaving a crater miles wide  to a planet called Pangoria  47  He has withstood a blast from Odin  who is far more powerful than Thor   50  attacks from Celestials  10  and even withstood attacks from the leader of the Celestials  51  Thor is extremely difficult to kill as his life force is considerably augmented by his godlike heritage  powers  Mjolnir  and the Odin Force   even if it is only relegated within Mjolnir as a smaller portion at the moment  52  Superhuman Speed  Thor can move at extreme speeds  Thor can fly to the sun in a matter of minutes  Thor was even able to strike down a moving Quicksilver and has claimed to have fought foes faster than him  53  He can throw Mjolnir at the speed of light 54  55  and also swing Mjolnir at TWICE the speed of light  56   It has been established that the speed of Thor s hammer transcends both Time  amp  Space 57   In addition  Thor can appear anywhere across the Universe or other dimensions in just seconds  58  59   Thor could visually detect objects that move at fantastic speeds  this happened when Thor was the target of artillery fire  32  and  60  when he saw the speedy Hermes   Hela once stated that Thor is as fast as the lightning he commands  Thor can twirl his cape so fast that he creates a tornado  61  Regenerative Healing Factor  Despite his astounding resistance to injury  it is possible to injure Thor  In the rare instances that he is injured  his body is capable of repairing damaged tissue with much greater speed and efficiency than the body of a human being and almost all other Asgardians  He can regenerate missing limbs or organs  with the aid of magical forces such as Mjolnir 62  or the Odin Force  46  Thor the God of Thunder Added by Govven1   Superhuman Longevity  Thor  like all other Asgardians  isn t immortal in the same sense of some other god pantheons  Thor ages at a pace far  far slower than a human being as he is countless eons old  mortals  life spans are comparable to nothing more than a blink of his immortal eyes  He has watched worlds die  and even witnessed Suns explode throughout his unimaginably long life meaning that he is at least billions of years old  63  The consumption of the Golden Apples of the goddess Iddun is essential to an Asgardian maintaining their physical vigor but this has not shown to apply to Thor  Thor is immune to the effects of all Earthly diseases and infections  Earth Control  After his resurrection  Thor has accepted his heritage as a child of the Elder Goddess Gaea and has gained the ability to control the Earth completely and has demonstrated this ability by being able to create continental spanning chasms and earthquakes that are off the Richter Scale in the Earth itself  64  He can control landslides and avalanches  20  Energy Manipulation  Thor has stated that he relies on the power of Mjolnir to often  Mjolnir does afford powers and abilities that he would not normally have  but Mjolnir is a tool and he has natural enery manipulation abilities without Mjolnir  During Ragnorak Thor had seen his family and friends fall to Loki s army and he reached down into himself for strength he never realized before and projected an energy blast so powerful that he knocked out Durok the Demolisher  who was so powerful that Thor  even with Mjolnir  was barely able to hold hold his own against  65  Lightning  Thor usually uses Mjolnir to channel his storm abilities but he is capable of discharging lightning bolts from his hands  66  Former Powers Chronokinesis  The Power of Time  Thor had the ability to use Mjonir to travel through time  By spinning Mjolnir faster than light Thor could open a portal to the fourth dimension of time to travel to the past and the future  12  56  67  By swinging Mjolnir in a precise manner  Thor can circumvent time by creating a time warp around certain areas  22  Rune Magic  During Ragnarok  Thor acquired knowledge and use of the Runes which granted him a practically infinite supply of mystical power and spells in addition to his other powers as a result of drinking from the Well of Mimir for wisdom and clarity of inner vision  Thor was able to cast spells generating a variety of powerful effects while in the Asgardian dimension including teleportation within a dimension  while even Odin could not   to Valhalla  Surtur s realm  and the Fates at the World Tree  Destroy a Mjolnir copy and channel it s energy into a magical force blast sufficient to destroy two demons simultaneously  unleash a wave of mystical energy strong enough to best Loki armed with a duplicate of Mjolnir  destroy the rebuilt Valhalla and slay numerous Rock Trolls in seconds  raise circular energy shields bordered by runes to block formidable blows of Mangog  see even without physical eyes and remove Loki s head without quenching his life  however  Thor s eyes have both been restored  Thor s command of and mastery of Rune Magic and Mysticism was far greater than any Asgardian or anyone in the Nine Realms  The only exception is Thor s father Odin and even then Thor already has demonstrated the potential to surpass his father in the future  It is unknown whether he still possesses the power of the Runes and if so to what degree since his birth  and there is no visible indication at any instance that the Runes have been retained  Odin Force Thorforce  The Odin Force  or rather Thor Force  enables him to tap into the practically infinite resources of cosmic and mystical energies of the dimension Asgard exists within  enhancing all of his abilities in turn  The sum total of Odin s power as the king of Asgard plus the power of his brothers Vili and Ve  as well as his own  which made Thor effectively omnipotent  The Odin Force significantly increased Thor s powers as well as giving him greater abilities than his father Odin and the previous Asgardian sky fathers possessed  While barely tapping into the limitless powers of his vast magical power  Thor easily disintegrating Captain America s shield with simply a look  easily teleporting Asgard into the skies above new York City  able to recreate the moon after it was destroyed in a battle with him and a powerful entity  will Mangog into nothingness  decapitate a Desak occupied Destroyer by focusing a portion of his power into one Mjolnir hurl  and easily conquer all of Earth  and defeat all of its inhabitants such as the Sorcerer Supreme Dr  Strange  According to the avatar of the Odin Force  Thor recreating celestial bodies and his other accomplishments during his time on Earth were nothing but minimal compared to the Odin Force s limitless power  68  After his rebirth  Thor possessed only a tiny portion of the seemingly infinite power source that is the Odin Force which he used in the fight where he killed Odin s father Bor  and now that is imbued in Mjolnir  52  Thorsleep  Like Odin before him  Thor was required at certain times to enter a period of rest called Thorsleep  during which he would replenish his energies and could not be disturbed  After gaining the power of the Runes in combination with the Odin Force  Thor s powers reached even greater heights  and he reached the point of surpassing his father in power to an even greater extent  With gaining the power if the Runes he gained understanding and enlightenment  He became virtually omniscient as well as quasi omnipotent  being able to see the past  present and future completely  being able to see past the veil of time itself  he could see the future of all things  of every man and beast  every leaf on every tree  he could see beyond quantum structure  beyond the cosmic architecture  into the nothingness itself and the end of all things  69  Power Grids Official Ratings 70  Intelligence  2 Strength 7  Speed 7  Durability 6  Energy Projection 6  Fighting Skills 4  Fan Ratings Intelligence 5  Strength 7  Speed 7  Durability 7  Energy Projection 7  Fighting Skills 7  Abilities Indomitable Will  Thor has shown to have a powerful force of will  so much so that he has defied the will of his father Odin  who is his king and is bound to serve him  on several occassions if he feels the need to do so  He does not back down from any foe  does not give into a fight and is willing to lay down his own life in defense of others  Great Knowledge of Magic  During Ragnarok  Thor acquired knowledge and use of the Runes which granted him a virtually infinite supply of mystical power and spells in addition to his other powers  considerably honing his long undeveloped vast magical potential  Master Combatant  Thor is a superbly skilled warrior trained in the arts of war with over countless eons of combat experience  He is known to be very cunning and intuitive in battles and wars having stalemated Captain America in martial combat and defeat Grog the God Crusher  while powerless and mortal with only his melee skills  Thor is one of the most skilled fighters to ever walk the Earth  He is a master marksman  and is proficient in all areas of combat including hand to hand and is skilled in the use of all Ancient European weapons specializing in swordsmanship and hammer throwing  Thor s martial methods may have been influenced by the fighting arts of the Vikings  Celts  Saxons  and Germanic tribes of ancient Europe  Being a War God as well as a Thunder God allows Thor to learn and master nearly all martial arts of Midgard as well  This gives Thor a huge advantage in combat by tapping into a vast multi cultural perspective of combat arts  skills  strategies and tactics  Thor is known to be very cunning and intuitive in battles and wars  Master Tactician  For over thousands of years  he has lead Asgard into battle against overwhelming forces with great leadership and employing strategies and tactics from possibly every culture on Earth as well as all the Nine Worlds of Asgard  including forgotten ones  Leadership  Thor serves as the as the first choice to defend Asgard from it s enemies  He has earned the trust of his fellow Asgardians to follow him into battle  When Odin died after his battle with Surtur  all of Asgard was behind the idea to follow Thor as the new King of Asgard  High Influential Connections  During his life  Thor has served Asgard as it s Prince  Lord  and King and with these positions he has had access to the wealth of Asgard to pay an Oklahoma land owner for the land he put Asgard on  all the weapons and magical artifacts in Asgard and field command of Asgard s forces in Odin s stead  As a founding member of the Avengers  he has a good reputation among Earth s heroes who would answer his call if needed and he would answer there call in return  He also has good relations with gods from other pantheons  so much that he was chosen to lead the God Squad to fight the Skull Patheon  Diplomatic Immunity  After Thor s rebirth he used Mjolnir to recreate Asgard on Earth in Oklahoma  At this time Iron Man was head of S H I E L D  and confronted Thor about his bringing Asgard in U S  territory  After Thor beat down Iron Man  Stark suggested that Asgard be treated as a foreign embassy and with it citizens full diplomatic privaleges  to which Thor agreed  71  Skilled Medic  Possessing a gifted intellect  Thor also has extensive medical knowledge due to his years spent on Earth as successful physician and surgeon Doctor Donald Blake and the EMT Jake Olson  Strength level Class 100    Thor possesses vast physical strength  to which the exact limit is unknown  but he is able to lift far in excess of 100 tons effortlessly  He has shown enough strength to move and lift objects that are as heavy as the Earth and shatter entire planets with his blows  Thor is physically one of the strongest beings to ever walk the Earth and one of the most physically powerful beings in the Universe  Paraphernalia Megingjord  a magical belt worn by the Thunder God that would double his natural strength and stamina   72  The warhammer Mjolnir  Thor wields Mjolnir  a hammer forged from Uru metal  whose chief properties are durability  the ability to maintain enchantment  and absorb energies  Mjolnir resembles more of a short handle mallet than a traditional warhammer  Mjolnir itself is already extremely durable like the Earth metal Adamantium or the Olympian metal Adamantine  and combined with the various enchantments placed upon it by Odin  is for all intents and purposes  indestructible  It has survived heat as extreme as the heart of the Sun  blasts powerful enough to destroy planets  and it has contained energy sufficient enough to destroy an entire Galaxy  When Loki attempted to use the Silver Surfer to defeat Thor  he tricked the Surfer into attacking Thor  Loki even augmented the Silver Surfer s powers with his own  after which the Surfer said that he had never felt that powerful before  He also claimed that Thor s hammer was far more powerful than his own Power Cosmic  To quote the Silver Surfer himself   I have seen his mallet s magic  it is truly mightier than my cosmic force   11  Thor often uses the hammer as a physical weapon  with almost nothing being capable of withstanding a hammer blow or throw  It has been described as impacting with sufficient force to  destroy mountains  and has proven capable of shattering the armor of a Celestial  with a rare exception being primary adamantium  Mjolnir also grants Thor countless mystical attributes and powers such as manipulation of the fundamental forces of the universe such as the electromagnetic spectrum  gravity  etc  A few other examples of the countless abilities Thor has shown with Mjolnir are  Worthiness Enchantment  This enchantment surrounding Mjolnir prevents it from being wielded by anyone save those who have been found worthy  Thus far  this includes Thor  the Red Norvell  Beta Ray Bill  and Captain America  To anyone else  Mjolnir cannot be lifted from the ground nor wrested from Thor s grip  Those who are deemed worthy are abled to wield Thor s powers  Captain America said  I ve never wielded such limitless power before   73   It s almost intoxicating   74  As the true master of Mjolnir  Thor can also will unto others the ability to wield the mystical hammer  bypassing the worthiness enchantment  and also empower them with his own godly abilities  As long as he is alive  no one but himself is able to wield the hammer  75  Mystical Link  Mjolnir obeys Thor s commands as though it were alive  and if Thor s will is strong enough  the hammer can pass through nearly any barrier to reach him should he so chooses  Mjolnir will even carve its way through the very center of entire planets to get back to Thor  76  Mjolnir can also transform Thor into his civilian guises  When Thor is a civilian  the hammer most often becomes an old wooden cane  While employing a mortal guise  Thor would transform back into his mortal form if he was separated from Mjolnir for more than 60 seconds  The 60 second enchantment is no longer in effect  Weather Control  Wielding Mjonir grants Thor the ability to control the base elements of a storm  i e  rain  wind  thunder  lightning and more  He can create giant raging electrical storms complete with thunder  lightning  hurricane force winds  tornadoes  blizzards  tidal waves  exploding volcanoes  earthquakes and torrential rains across entire planets at a moment s notice  He can also create any of these phenomena individually  Another aspect of this power allows him to stop any of these weather conditions instantly as well  Thor can create storms on a planetary wide scale or larger if needed  and is not limited to the normal limits of Mother Nature and can go beyond and defy what natural weather can do such as creating rain in space where there is no atmosphere  Thor s ability to control and create storms extends to any and all storms as he has been shown to control and create raging temporal storms in time  create Solar Flares  powerful stellar winds in space and so on  Flight  Thor is capable of hurling Mjolnir with great force and  by holding onto the leather thong  is capable of flying through the air at tremendous speeds  While in an Earth like atmosphere  Thor generally flies at roughly the Speed of Sound  roughly 770 miles per hour  Thor can fly so fast that he is invisible to the naked eye  20  He has been clocked flying at three times the speed of light  77  and is capable of achieving speeds far greater than that  He can use the winds to hover and has shown the ability to fly without the aid of Mjolnir  Energy Projection  With Mjolnir  Thor can project powerful mystical blasts of energy  He can even channel energies for stronger energy attacks  God Blast  Thor is capable of channeling different amounts of his godly energies in combination with the mystical properties of Mjolnir can be channeled through his hammer for a single massive blast known as the God Blast  15  78  His godly energy is so vast and powerful  that even when reinforced with the Belt of Strength  which should double Mjolnir s fortification and durability  when Thor channeled his godly energies into Mjolinr to destroy the Brain Dome of the mighty Celestial Exitar  15  the hammer shattered from the amount of power Thor channeled  The God Blast is so immensely powerful and destructive that it has proven capable of destroying beings as large and as powerful as the Midgard Serpent and even causing such a great degree of damage to a being such as Galactus that he was forced to flee for his life  79  Thor can send the God Blast to the core of Ego the Living Planet and Alter Ego and render both comatose  80  He has also used the God Blast to defeat Surtur  Ymir  Juggernaut  and Zelia  Anti Force  Thor is capable of producing an indescribably powerful blast known as the Anti Force which is capable of annihilating entire planets  This blast is so powerful that with just a single emission  Thor was capable of putting down and seemingly killing the powerful entity known as Mangog himself  Thermo blast  Thor has the ability to produce a Universe shaking thermo blast capable of decimating even entire planets and beings as powerful as Ego the living planet  81  Barriers  With Mjolnir  Thor is capable of creating powerful barriers  force fields and vortexes that are impenetrable  Not even Earth s most advanced weapons could weaken Thor s barrier field that shieled the U N  headquarters  82  Thor stated that he could have contained a cosmic flash attack from Stellaris  this blast was strong enough to destroy the planet Earth  83  These vortexes and barriers are so immensely durable that Thor was able to completely contain the explosion generated by a life bomb  which is so powerful it would have completely destroyed a fifth of the Marvel Universe  without the vortex even faltering  meaning that Thor literally contained a blast that is capable of annihilating millions upon millions of Galaxies  84  Energy Sensing  Mjolnir can detect practically all types of energy  85  86  87  It reacts particularly strongly to evil psychic energy  88  and can also track down the energy patern of someone in hiding  89  Mjolnir can also detect any Asgardians aura by their electrons discharge  90  Energy Absorption and Redirection  Thor is able to use Mjolnir to absorb any energy blasts directed towards him as means of attack  Once the energy is absorbed  Thor can redirect it back amplified many times over towards the source and or use it as a weapon of his own  Thor has used Mjolnir to reflect the vast and hazardous amounts of energy being emitted by the biological weapon implanted within the Wasp s body by the Skrulls back at her while all of Earth s other super humans were helpless  Thor used Mjolnir to absorb Ultron s entire energy source  the Silver Surfer s Power Cosmic  91 Sky Walker s Cosmic Tempest  92  radio active energy  93  magnetism 47  such as Magneto s personal magnetic field 94  and a portion of the Pangoria s planetary magnetic field  Mjolnir s ability to absorb energy is so powerful he managed to absorb  contain and redirect the entire energy of the Null Bomb  which was powerful enough to destroy the entire galaxy  95  absorb mystical energies  such as Pluto s mystic flame  96  He was even able to absorb a portion of the mystical energies from every god patheon on Earth  97  and absorbed the electromagnetic energies of the Celestial Mother ship  51  Teleportation  By grasping Mjolnir by the leather thong and rapidly swirling it  Thor can channel energies for the purpose of opening gateways which he and others can pass through  98  He can open gateways which allow him to travel across locations no matter how great the distance within moments or even across entire dimensions  as he does when he travels from Asgard to Earth and vice versa  99  100  Thor has used Mjolnir to rip the fabric of the Universe to send Surtur and Yimir to the Death Dimension 101  and send an entire population to Limbo  102  Thor can also use Mjolnir to travel through portals anywhere within the same dimension  103  He formerly possessed the ability to travel through time 12   but the temporal energies of the hammer were drained when Immortus asked Thor to use his hammer to save the planet Phantus and bring it back out of limbo and into the space time continuum  Matter Manipulation  This ability allows Thor to manipulate matter from a molecular level to a vast scale  which allows him to create other configurations and even allows him to transmute the elements themselves  This ability was evident when he transmuted the Absorbing Man s wood and iron body to the gas helium  Resurrection  While channeling his power through Mjolnir  Thor was able to resurrect a man he had wrongly killed  32  Alpha Particles  Thor s hammer can harness Alpha Particles from the atmosphere and could use it to atomize any weaponry  13  Negation of Mystic Energy  He used this ability on the Juggernaut himself to negate the mystical energies that grant him his mystical invulnerability  allowing him to defeat Juggernaut in combat  He was able to stop Mephisto from taking human souls to the Dark Dimension  104  Cosmic Energy  Mjolnir allows Thor to produce and control Cosmic Energy to an unknown limit for a variety of purposes   105  Electromagnetic Spectrum Manipulation  Thor was able to absorb and manipulate the electromagentic energies of the Celestial Mothership  51  Invisibility and Intangibility  Thor can turn himself or others  using Mjolnir  completely intangible and or invisible  106  An offshoot of this ability is that Thor can use Mjolnir to completely disrupt the phasing abilities of super humans such as the Vision  Shadowcat etc  107  Event Recall  Thor can use Mjolnir to recall past events  108  Transmigration of Souls  Thor s hammer has the ability to manipulate souls  14  Life Force Absorption  Thor used this ability on the supervillain the Presence  who was forced to surrender before being reduced to a lifeless husk  109  Illusion Detection  Mjolnir can distinguish images  holograms  and different illusions from reality  Thor once commanded the hammer to strike the demon lord Mephisto  who was hiding amongst false images of himself  104  Interdimensional Messaging  Thor can used Mjolnir to send psychic messages between the nine realms  Undead Lethality  As a former religious relic  Mjolnir is lethal to undead  Thor once threw Mjolnir at a vampire  with contact causing the vampire to burst into flame and crumble to dust  110  Transformation  When Thor was living on Earth under his mortal guise  he could use Mjolnir to transfor from his Donald Blaker persona into Thor and vice versa  Thor loses this ability when Odin permanently separates the two personas  Immunity to Other Forces  Even without activating the powers of Mjolnir  Thor s hammer  enchanted by Odin  is impervious to nearly all forms of change  as he himself claimed that no power in the universe but the All Father s could affect Mjolnir  shown when Amora s magical efforts during her first confrontation with Thor to change it into a deadly serpent availed her naught  The Odinsword Ragnarok  His father sword  Used to slay his uncle the Serpent  NotesEdit The traditional helmet that Thor wears was gifted to him as an adolescent from the All Father Odin   111  Stan Lee on creating Thor   How do you make someone stronger than the strongest person  the Hulk   It finally came to me  Don t make him human   make him a god  I decided readers were already pretty familiar with the Greek and Roman gods  It might be fun to delve into the old Norse legends     Besides  I pictured Norse gods looking like Vikings of old  with the flowing beards  horned helmets  and battle clubs     Journey into Mystery  needed a shot in the arm  so I picked Thor     to headline the book  After writing an outline depicting the story and the characters I had in mind  I asked my brother  Larry  to write the script because I didn t have time     and it was only natural for me to assign the penciling to Jack Kirby     Added by Akinwale LinksEdit 1 700 Appearances of Thor  Thor Odinson  855 Images featuring Thor  Thor Odinson  171 Quotations by or
