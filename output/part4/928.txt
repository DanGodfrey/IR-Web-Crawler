 a b c Including de facto annexed incorporated territories    Office formally vacant  Adolf Hitler styled himself F hrer und Reichskanzler from August 1934  1    a b Through the Enabling Act of 1933  the German government was vested with legislative powers  although the Reichstag formally continued to exist as a law making body  Nazi Germany  also called the Third Reich  was the name for Germany from 1933 to 1945  when it was a totalitarian state ruled by Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party  NSDAP   Nazi Germany is best known for its aggressive foreign policy  for launching World War II in Europe and the Holocaust  which resulted in the death of millions of European Jews and other minorities  On 30 January 1933 Hitler became chancellor of Germany  quickly eliminating all opposition to rule as sole leader  The state idolized Hitler as its F hrer   leader    centralizing all power in his hands  Under the F hrerprinzip   leader principle    the F hrer s word was considered to be above all other laws  Top officials reported to Hitler and followed his policies  but they had considerable autonomy  The government was not a coordinated  cooperating body  but rather a collection of factions struggling to amass power and curry favor with the F hrer  In the midst of the Great Depression  the Nazi government restored prosperity and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a mixed economy of free market and central planning practices  Extensive public works were undertaken  including the construction of the Autobahns  The return to prosperity gave the regime enormous popularity and made Hitler s rule mostly unchallenged  Racism  especially antisemitism  was a main tenet of society in Nazi Germany  The Gestapo  secret state police  and Schutzstaffel  SS  under Heinrich Himmler destroyed the liberal  socialist  and communist opposition and persecuted and murdered the Jews  The Nordic people  considered to be a branch of the Aryan race  were thought to be the master race  Education focused on racial biology  population policy  and physical fitness  Membership in the Hitler Youth organization became compulsory  The number of women enrolled in post secondary education plummeted  and womens  rights were sharply curtailed  Entertainment and tourism were organized via the Strength Through Joy program  The government controlled artistic expression  promoting specific forms of art and discouraging or banning others  Propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels made effective use of film  mass rallies  and Hitler s hypnotizing oratory to control public opinion  The 1936 Summer Olympics showcased the Third Reich on the international stage  Nazi Germany made aggressive demands for territory  threatening war if they were not met  Austria was annexed in the Anschluss in 1938  and the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia was taken via the Munich Agreement that same year  Hitler made a pact with Stalin and invaded Poland in September 1939  starting World War II in Europe  In alliance with Mussolini s Italy  Germany conquered most of Europe by 1940  and threatened its remaining major foe  Great Britain  Reichskommissariate  Reich Commissariats  were established in conquered areas  and a German administration termed the General Government was established in Poland  Concentration camps  established as early as 1933  were used to hold political prisoners and opponents of the regime  The number of camps quadrupled between 1939 and 1942 to 300   as slave laborers from across Europe  Jews  political prisoners  criminals  homosexuals  gypsies  the mentally ill and others were imprisoned  The tide turned after the failure of Operation Barbarossa the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941  The Soviets counter attacked in a series of huge  fierce battles that overwhelmed the Nazis  Germany was overrun in 1945 by the Soviets from the east and the remaining Allies from the west  The victorious Allies initiated a policy of denazification and put the Nazi leadership on trial for war crimes at the Nuremberg Trials  Contents 1 Name 2 History 2 1 Consolidation of power 3 Foreign policy 3 1 Austria and Czechoslovakia 3 2 World War II 3 2 1

External links Name The official name of the state was the Deutsches Reich   German Realm   from 1933 to 1943  and the Gro deutsches Reich   Greater German Realm   from 1943 to 1945  The name Deutsches Reich has often been translated into English as the  German Empire  or the partially translated  German Reich   but it literally means  German Realm   4  The most popular English terms are  Nazi Germany  and  Third Reich   The latter suggests a historical succession from the medieval Holy Roman Empire  962 1806  and the modern German Empire  1871 1918   5  Historiographically  Germans today refer to the period as Zeit des Nationalsozialismus or the abreviated NS Zeit   National Socialist period    History Main article  History of Germany The Nazi movement arose among angry young veterans in the early 1920s  they rejected the Treaty of Versailles  1919   the Weimar republic  and democracy generally  They called for a revival of the Aryan race and blamed the Jews for Germany s troubles  Highly effective Nazi propaganda effectively used the  Stab in the back legend  to explain the German military defeat in 1918  that is that Jews  Communists and other subversives in Berlin were to blame  The Nazi movement was small until the global Great Depression that began in 1929  It intensified the reaction against the modernity and liberalism of the Weimar Republic  6   Simultaneously on the left the Communist Party of Germany  controlled by Moscow  gained strength as the middle was squeezed  Many Germans decided the Nazi Party was capable of restoring order  quelling civil unrest  and restoring Germany s international reputation  6  Adolf Hitler  Chancellor of Germany  January 1933 The Nazis promised a strong authoritarian government  civic peace  radical economic policies  including full employment   increased Lebensraum   living space   for Germanic peoples  formation of a national community based on race  and racial cleansing via the active suppression of Jews  7  The Nazis promised national and cultural renewal based upon the V lkisch movement  traditionalism  proposed rearmament  repudiation of reparations  and reclamation of territory lost to the Treaty of Versailles  After the federal election of 1932  the Nazis were the largest party in the Reichstag  holding 230 seats  8  On 30 January 1933  President Hindenburg  under pressure from Franz von Papen  appointed Hitler as Chancellor of Germany  This event is knows as the Machtergreifung   siezure of power    By becoming the Vice Chancellor and keeping the Nazis a cabinet minority  von Papen expected to be able to control Hitler  Although the Nazis had won the greatest share of the popular vote in the two Reichstag general elections of 1932  they did not have a majority  so Hitler led a short lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and the German National People s Party  DNVP   9  Consolidation of power Within a few months  the new government installed a single party dictatorship in Germany with legal measures establishing a coordinated central government   see Gleichschaltung   On the night of 27 February 1933  the Reichstag building was set afire  a Dutch communist was found guilty  The Nazis claimed that the arson was a signal for a communist uprising and thousands of communist party members were arrested  the party offices raided and all KPD publications banned  The Nazis imprisoned many in the Dachau concentration camp  The Reichstag Fire Decree  27 February 1933   rescinded most German civil liberties to suppress their opponents  The  Fire Decree  was the second enactment that allowed the Nazi administration to restrict civil liberties  The first was a rule that forbade Germans from  insulting the flag  and this was used consistently to repress any kind of opposition  10  In March 1933  with the Enabling Act  was passed by 444 94  the remaining Social Democrats   the Reichstag changed the Weimar Constitution to allow Hitler s government to pass laws without parliamentary debate for a four year period  even such deviating from other articles in the constitution  the Act  forming the legal basis for the regime  was subsequently renewed by Hitler s government in 1937 and 1941   Forthwith  throughout 1934  the Nazi Party ruthlessly eliminated all political opposition  the Enabling Act already had banned the Communists  KPD   the Social Democrats  SPD  were dissolved in June  and in the June July period  the Nationalists  DNVP   the People s Party  DVP  and the German State Party  DStP  were likewise obliged to disband  their members urged to join the Nazi Party or else leave politics  Moreover  at the urging of Franz von Papen  the remaining Catholic Centre Party disbanded on 5 July 1933 after obtaining Nazi guarantees for Catholic religious education and youth groups  On 14 July 1933  Germany became a de facto single party state  as the founding of new parties was banned  Further elections in late 1933  1936 and 1938 were entirely Nazi controlled and only saw the Nazis and a minor number of independent  guests   such as Hugenberg  elected for the rubber stamp legislature  Flag of Nazi Germany  used jointly with the swastika flag  1933 35 Sole national flag of Nazi Germany  1935 45 The Nazi regime abolished the symbols of the Weimar Republic  including the black red gold tricolor flag  and adopted new and old imperial symbolism representing the dual nature of Germany s third empire  The previous  imperial black white red tricolor was restored as one of Germany s two official national flags  the second was the swastika flag of the Nazi party  which became the sole national German flag in 1935  The Nazi anthem  Horst Wessel Lied    Horst Wessel Song   became a second national anthem  11  On 30 January 1934  Chancellor Hitler formally centralized government power to himself with the Act to Rebuild the Reich  by disbanding L nder  federal state  parliaments and transferring states  powers and administration to the Berlin central government  The centralization began soon after the March 1933 Enabling Act promulgation  when state governments were replaced with Reich governors  Local government also was deposed  Reich governors appointed mayors of cities and towns with populaces of fewer than 100 000  the Interior Minister appointed the mayors of cities with populaces greater than 100 000  and  in the cases of Berlin and Hamburg  and Vienna in 1938   Hitler had personal discretion to appoint their mayors  By spring of 1934  only the army remained independent of government control  traditionally  it was separate from the national government  a discrete entity  Ernst R hm  leader of the Nazi paramilitary Sturmabteilung  SA   Storm Detachment    which had several million members  intended to assume command of the Reichswehr and absorb it into its ranks  12  To complement the  nationalist revolution   R hm favored a  second revolution   which would tear down industrialists  big business  the Junker aristorcracy  and Prussian control of the military  13  Matters came to a head in June 1934 when President Hindenburg informed Hitler that if he didn t move to curb the SA then Hindenburg would dissolve the Government and declare martial law  14  At the risk of appearing to talk nonsense I tell you that the National Socialist movement will go on for 1 000 years      Don t forget how people laughed at me 15 years ago when I declared that one day I would govern Germany  They laugh now  just as foolishly  when I declare that I shall remain in power    Adolf Hitler to a British correspondent in Berlin  June 1934 15  March at Reichsparteitag  Nuremberg  1935 Convinced by Heinrich Himmler and Hermann G ring that a plot was afoot to depose him  Hitler ordered the Schutzstaffel  SS  and the Gestapo to assassinate his political enemies both in and outside the Nazi Party with the  Night of the Long Knives   The purges of Ernst R hm  his SA cohort  the Strasserist  left wing Nazis  and other political enemies lasted from 30 June to 2 July 1934  and resulted in up to 200 deaths  16  While some Germans were shocked by the killing  others admired Hitler s decisive actions to restore order  17  Upon the death of Hindenburg  on 2 August 1934  the Nazi controlled Reichstag consolidated the offices of Reichspr sident  Reich President  and Reichskanzler  Reich Chancellor   and reinstalled Hitler as F hrer und Reichskanzler  Leader and Reich Chancellor   After the  Night of the Long Knives  and Hindenburg s death  the Reichswehr was prepared to accept Hitler s leadership  As Hitler had announced plans to rearm and increase the size of the Reichswehr  the agreement of the generals was unsurprising  The assassination of R hm and the SA leaders consolidated the Reichswehr as the sole armed force of the Reich  and the F hrer s promises of military expansion guaranteed him military loyalty  Hindenburg s death facilitated changing the German soldiers  oath of allegiance from the Reich of the Weimar Constitution to personal fealty to Adolf Hitler  18  In the event  the Nazis ended the official NSDAP DNVP government alliance and began introducing Nazism and Nazi symbolism to public and private German life  textbooks were revised  or rewritten to promote the Pan German racist doctrine of Gro deutschland  Greater Germany  to be established by the Nazi Herrenvolk  teachers who opposed curricular Nazification were dismissed  Furthermore  to coerce popular obedience to the state  the Nazis established the Gestapo  secret state police  as independent of civil authority  The Gestapo controlled the German populace with some 100 000 spies and informers  and thereby were aware of anti Nazi criticism and dissent  The majority of the German people were relieved that the conflicts and street fighting had been ended and were deluged in a barrage of propaganda orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels and which promised peace and plenty for all in a united  Marxist free country that would redress the wrongs done to Germany in the Versailles Treaty  original research   when   The first concentration camp for political prisoners was opened at Dachau near Munich in 1933 and  between 1933 and 1945  more than 3 million Germans had been in concentration camps  or prison  for political reasons   19  20  21   Tens of thousands of Germans were killed for one or another form of resistance  Between 1933 and 1945  Sondergerichte  Nazi  special courts   sentenced some 12 000 Germans to death  courts martial ordered the execution of 25 000 German soldiers on charges of cowardice  while civil courts sentenced 40 000 Germans  Many of these Germans were part of the government  civil  or military service  a circumstance which enabled them to engage in subversion and conspiracy  while involved  marginally or significantly  in the government s policies   22  Foreign policy Germany pulled out of the League of Nations in 1933  Hitler began to systematically undermine and eradicate the provisions of the Versailles Treaty that were still valid in 1933  The disarmament clauses had been long since abandoned and Hitler achieved a minor victory when he withdrew Germany from the League of Nations on the grounds that disarmament was applied only to Germany  In January 1935 the Saarland voted to become part of Germany  The region had been placed under League of Nations supervision for 15 years and the decision was greeted as a great victory for the new Germany  In March 1935 Hitler announced that the Reichswehr would be increased to 550 000 men and that there would be a German Air Force  23  When Britain agreed that the Germans would be allowed to build a naval fleet  the Treaty became little more than a piece of paper  The signees were ready in the name of peace  to negotiate away on a bilateral basis the terms that Germany had agreed to in 1919  Hitler s next test of the resolve of the French and British governments  intention to uphold the Versailles Treaty came in March 1936  Mussolini  Hitler s forerunner as a dictator and at the time an object of admiration  invaded Ethiopia  leading to mild protests by the British and French governments  In the wake of this crisis  Hitler ordered the Reichswehr to march into the demilitarised zone in the Rhineland  with the proviso that they should withdraw if the French mobilised in response  The French government was in its usual state of internal bickering and Britain had no interest in  and no way of stopping the Reichswehr  The result was a huge victory for Hitler  He had tested the resolve of his opponents and they had been found wanting  Not that there was anything they could have done  for French military strategy was dictated by the existence of the Maginot Line  behind which their army was to remain  come what may  and British politicians regarded the Rhineland as Germany s own backyard  Hitler then held an election in which he received an overwhelming vote of support and his reputation as a vigorous and determined leader was growing fast  24  The following year was relatively quiet on the foreign affairs front  The Spanish Civil War occupied the headlines in Europe  which was a useful trial ground for the growing Luftwaffe  German Air Force   Austria and Czechoslovakia Main articles  Anschluss and Munich Agreement The German minority in Czechoslovakia welcome Nazi troops in October 1938  In November 1937  Hitler drew the military leadership together for a conference at which he elucidated the need for Germany to expand eastwards for Lebensraum  At first he would have to deal with Austria and Czechoslovakia  but he was confident that Britain and France would do nothing when the German armies moved in  24  In February 1938  Hitler called the Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg to a meeting at the Berghof at which he harangued Schussnigg on the need for Germans to secure their frontiers  To forestall Hitler and to preserve Austria s independence  Schuschnigg scheduled a plebiscite on the issue for 13 March  but Hitler demanded that it be canceled  On 11 March  Hitler sent an ultimatum to Schuschnigg  demanding that he hand over all power to the Austrian Nazis or face an invasion  On 12 March the Wehrmacht entered Austria  to be greeted with enthusiasm by the Austrians  25  Hitler told the leader of the Sudeten German Party  Konrad Henlein  to make a number of unacceptable demands to the Czechoslovak government  Mussolini insisted that Hitler meet the British and French prime ministers to discuss the Czechoslovak crisis  Hitler demanded the immediate annexation of the German areas  called  Sudetenland    Two more meetings followed  in the second of which  the infamous  Munich Agreement  was signed  forcing the Czechoslovak government to accept the annexation  but having no part in the negotiations  The Munich Agreement has had a highly controversial reception among historians and political scientists  One interpretation sees it as a cowardly  Appeasement    an unwise and unnecessarily capitulation to vehement threats  Other scholars argue that risking war at that stage was unwise because France and Britain had neither the weapons nor a coherent strategy to defeat Germany in 1938  Chamberlain was greeted as a hero when he landed in London bringing  he said   peace for our time   The agreement lasted six months before Hitler seized the rest in March 1939  26  Hitler s next move was to call for adjustments to the borders of Poland  In the House of Commons  Chamberlian warned that any further attempts by Hitler to change the status quo would lead to war  In effect  this declaration guaranteed help to Poland and made the outbreak of war inevitable  The Wehrmacht began to prepare for an invasion of Poland  while the German foreign office made attempts to keep Britain out of the conflict  On 23 May 1939  Hitler ordered his generals to prepare for the attack on Poland  27  This has been described as a typical Hitler  bluff  by Taylor 28  but the dynamics of mobilisation probably belie this position  for it takes several months to prepare an army for such an attack and the war began with the invasion of Poland on 1 September  just as Hitler had ordered  Hitler was still uncertain what Stalin would do when Poland was attacked  The Russian regime might be the  anti christ   Kershaw  to the Nazis but it was a crucial element in the invasion of Poland  Britain and France had sent envoys to Moscow with the aim of tying Stalin into a pact  Molotov  Stalin s foreign minister  visted Berlin in July 1939 and elegant hints were dropped about the need for an agreement between Berlin and Moscow  But Stalin was in no hurry  On 20 August  Hitler telegraphed Stalin with an offer of an agreement to be signed on 22 or 23 August  Ribbentrop  the german foreign minister  flew to Moscow and an agreement was signed between Russia and Germany that made the second world war inevitable  Hitler was delighted  He knew  he told his entourage  that Britain and France would do nothing  Their leaders were worms  he said  he had seen them at Munich  The compromise over Sudetenland still rankled  29  The agreement signed in Moscow provided for peace for a period of ten years between the two countries  There was a secret protocol attached in which Poland was divided up  in the event of a conflict  between Russia and Germany  Russia got the Baltic countries and Hitler could attack Poland  World War II See also  European Theatre of World War II and History of Germany during World War II Animated map showing German and Axis allies  conquests in Europe throughout World War II Conquest of Europe The  Danzig crisis  peaked in early 1939  around the time that reports of controversy in the Free City of Danzig increased  the United Kingdom  guaranteed  to defend Poland s territorial integrity and the Poles rejected a series of offers by Nazi Germany regarding both the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor  Then  the Germans broke off diplomatic relations  Hitler had learned that the Soviet Union was willing to sign a non aggression pact with Germany and would support an attack on Poland  Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939 and two days later  the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany  World War II was underway  but Poland fell quickly  as the Soviets attacked it on 17 September  The United Kingdom proceeded to bomb Wilhelmshaven  Cuxhaven  30 Heligoland 31  and other areas  Still  aside from battles at sea  no other activity occurred  Thus  the war became known as  the Phoney War   The year 1940 began with little more than the UK dropping propaganda leaflets over Prague and Vienna 32  but a German attack on the British High Seas fleet was followed by the British bombing the port city of Sylt  33  After the Altmark Incident off the coast of Norway and the discovery of the United Kingdom s plans to encircle Germany  Hitler sent troops into Denmark and Norway  This safeguarded iron ore supplies from Sweden through coastal waters  Shortly thereafter  the British and French landed in Mid  and North Norway  but the Germans de facto defeated these forces in the ensuing Norwegian Campaign  German soldiers marching past the Arc de Triomphe  14 June 1940 In May 1940  the Phoney War ended  Against the will of his advisors  Hitler ordered an attack on France through the Low Countries  The Battle of France ended with an overwhelming German victory  However  with the British refusing Hitler s offer of peace  the war continued  Germany and Britain continued to fight at sea and in the air  The British bombed Berlin  which sent Hitler into a rage  The German leader ordered attacks on British cities  and Britain was bombed heavily during The Blitz  This change in targeting priority interfered with the Luftwaffe s objective of achieving the air superiority over Britain necessary for an invasion and allowed British air defenses to rebuild their strength and continue the fight  The Germans lost the Battle of Britain in fall 1940  but then turned to planning the invasion of the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa  June 1941  Germany and its allies invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941  Hitler hoped that rapid success in the Soviet Union would bring Britain to the negotiating table  Operation Barbarossa was supposed to begin earlier  however  failed Italian ventures in North Africa and the Balkans caused Hitler concern  In February 1941  the German Afrika Korps was sent to Libya to aid the Italians and hold the British Commonwealth forces from British held Egypt  As the North African Campaign continued  the Afrika Korps regained lost Italian territory  pushed the British back across the desert and advanced into Egypt  In April  the Germans launched the invasion of Yugoslavia to aid friendly forces and restore control in the Balkans  This was followed by the Battle of Greece  again to bail out the Italians  and the Battle of Crete  Because of the diversions in North Africa and the Balkans  the Germans were not able to launch Barbarossa until late in June  Moreover  men and material were diverted to create the  fortified Europe  that Hitler wanted before Germany focused its attention on the East  Citizens of Leningrad during the 872 day siege of Leningrad  in which about 1 million civilians died  Nevertheless  Barbarossa began with great success  Only Hitler worried that the German Army and its allies were not advancing into the Soviet Union fast enough  By December 1941  the Germans and their allies were at the gates of Moscow  to the north  troops had reached Leningrad and surrounded the city  34  Meanwhile  Germany and its allies controlled almost all of mainland Europe  with the exception of neutral Ireland  Portugal  Spain  Switzerland  Sweden  Spain  and Turkey  On 11 December 1941  four days after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor  Nazi Germany declared war on the United States  Not only was this a chance for Germany to strengthen its ties with Japan  but after months of anti German hysteria in the American media and Lend Lease aid to Britain  the leaking of Rainbow Five and the foreboding content of President Franklin D  Roosevelt s Pearl Harbor speech made it clear to Hitler that the US could not be kept neutral  Moreover  Germany s policy of appeasement  designed to keep the US out of the war  was a burden to Germany s war effort  Germany had refrained from attacking American convoys  even if they were bound for the United Kingdom or the Soviet Union  By contrast  after Germany declared war on the US  the German navy began unrestricted submarine warfare  using U boats to attack ships without warning  The goal of Germany s navy  the Kriegsmarine  was to cut off Britain s supply line  Under these circumstances  one of the most famous naval battles in history took place  with the German battleship Bismarck  Germany s largest and most powerful warship  attempting to break out into the Atlantic and raid supply ships heading for Britain  Bismarck was sunk   but not before sending Britain s largest warship  the battlecruiser HMS Hood  to the depths of the ocean  German U boats were more successful than surface raiders like Bismarck  However  Germany failed to make submarine production a top priority early on and by the time it did  the British and their allies were developing the technology and strategies to neutralize it  Furthermore  in spite of the submarines  early success in 1941 and 1942  material shortages in Britain failed to fall to their World War I levels  The Allied victory in the Battle of the Atlantic was achieved at a huge cost  between 1939 and 1945  3 500 Allied ships were sunk  gross tonnage 14 5 million  at a cost of 783 German U boats  35  Persecution and extermination campaigns Jewish twins kept alive to be used in Mengele s medical experiments  These children from Auschwitz were liberated by the Red Army in January  1945  The persecution of racial  ethnic  and social minorities and  undesirables  continued in Germany and the occupied countries  From 1941  Jews were required to wear a yellow badge in public  most were kept in walled ghettos  where they remained isolated from the general populace  In January 1942  the Wannsee Conference  headed by Reinhard Heydrich  direct subordinate of Reichsf hrer SS Heinrich Himmler   redacted the plans for the  Final Solution of the Jewish Question   Endl sung der Judenfrage   During the Nazi regime some six million Jews  and a sizeable number of Romani people  Jehovah s Witnesses  Poles and other Slavs  Soviet POWs  people with mental and or physical disabilities  homosexuals  and members of the political and religious opposition were killed  36  Altogether  more than ten million people were put into forced labour  In 1978  the term  Holocaust  came into general use to describe this genocide in English  It is called the Shoah in Hebrew  In addition to eliminating the Jews the Nazis also planned the ethnic cleansing of some 30 45 million Slavs  Poles  Russians  Ukrainians  etc   who would have been ruthlessly moved or killed in order to make way for 10 million German settlers  37  It was the Generalplan Ost  General Plan East  for the conquest  ethnic cleansing  and exploitation of the populaces of the captured territories  The food that went to Russians would be diverted to the German army and German civilians  The Russians would starve and their cities razed and turned into forests  38  Because of the oppression they suffered under Soviet rule  many Ukrainians  Balts  and other oppressed nationalities  fought for the Nazis  The populaces of Nazi occupied Soviet Russia who racially qualified as of the Aryan race  or had no immediate Jewish ancestors  were not persecuted  and often were recruited into the Waffen SS divisions  Eventually  the Nazi regime meant to Germanize the racially acceptable Volk  ethnic groups  of occupied eastern Europe  with the rest to be exterminated  39  Parts of the plan were implemented in Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany  with the classification of Poles on the Nazi Volksliste  according to their racial characteristics  40  People classified as Germans who resisted were sent to concentration camps  41  Those who were not classified as Germans were expelled  42 Ethnic Germans from the Baltic states were encouraged to leave them  and were settled in Poland in the houses of the expelled Poles  These  and the Poles classified as Germans  were subjected to programs to Germanize them  43 Children were also abducted from Eastern Europe for Germanization  44  Allied victory Field Marshal Rommel inspecting the Free India Legion  France  1944 US soldiers cross the Franco German Siegfried Line In early 1942  the Red Army counter attacked  and  by winter s end  the Wehrmacht were no longer immediately outside Moscow  Yet the Germans and their allies held a strong line  and  in the summer  launched a major attack against the petroleum fields of the Caucasus in Southern Russia  For securing the flanks of this offensive  a line at the Volga had to be held  which led to the Battle of Stalingrad  17 July 1942   2 February 1943   wherein Germany and its allies were defeated  After winning a major tank battle at Kursk Orel in July 1943  the Red Army progressed west  to Germany  henceforth  the Wehrmacht and its allies remained on the defensive  In Libya  the Afrika Korps failed to break through the

others  the cities of Hamburg  Cologne and Dresden  killing thousands of civilians  and causing hardship for the survivors  45  Contemporary estimates of Nazi German military dead is 5 5 million  46  In November 1942  the Wehrmacht and the Italian Army retreated to Tunisia  where they fought the Americans and the British in the Tunisia Campaign  17 November 1942   13 May 1943   The Allies invaded Sicily and Italy next  but met fierce resistance  particularly at Anzio  22 January 1944   5 June 1944  and Cassino  17 January 1944   18 May 1944   and the campaign continued from mid 1943 to nearly the end of the war  In June 1944  American  British and Canadian forces established the western front with the D Day  6 June 1944  landings in Normandy  France  After the successful Operation Bagration  22 June   19 August 1944   the Red Army was in Poland  and in East Prussia  West Prussia  and Silesia the German populaces fled en masse  fearing Communist persecution  atrocity  and death  In spring of 1945  the Red Army was at Berlin  US and UK forces had conquered most of west Germany  and would go on to meet up with the Red Army at Torgau on the Elbe on 26 April 1945   During the Battle of Berlin  16 April 1945   2 May 1945   Hitler and key staff members lived in the armoured  underground F hrerbunker while above ground the Red Army fought remnant forces made up of the German army  Hitler Youth  and Waffen SS for control of the ruined capital city of Nazi Germany  In the F hrerbunker  Hitler became psychologically isolated and detached  At the situation conference of 22 April  Hitler suffered a total nervous collapse when he was informed that the instructions he had issued the previous day for SS General Felix Steiner s Army Detachment Steiner to move to the rescue of Berlin had not materialised  47  Hitler openly declared for the first time the war was lost and blamed the generals  Hitler announced he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself  48  On 23 April  as Berlin became more isolated  Hermann G ring sent Hitler an ultimatum  threatening to assume command of Nazi Germany if he received no reply which he would interpret as Hitler being incapacitated  Upon receiving the ultimatum  the F hrer ordered G ring s immediate arrest  and despatched an aeroplane delivering the reply to G ring in Bavaria  By 25 April the Red Army encirclement of Berlin was complete and secure radio communications with defending units had been lost  the command staff in the bunker complex were depending on telephone lines for passing orders and on public radio for news and information  49  Despite the losses of armies and lands  the F hrer neither relinquished power  nor surrendered  On 28 April  a BBC report stated that Reichsf hrer SS Heinrich Himmler had offered surrender to the western Allies  50  Hitler ordered Himmler s arrest and had Hermann Fegelein  Himmler s SS representative at Hitler s HQ in Berlin  shot  51  Capitulation of German forces American paratroopers posing with a captured Nazi flag  two days after landing at Normandy On 30 April 1945  after intense street to street combat in Berlin  when Soviet troops were within a block or two of the Reich Chancellery  Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide in his F hrerbunker  52  Two days later  on 2 May 1945  German General Helmuth Weidling unconditionally surrendered Berlin to Soviet General Vasily Chuikov  53  Hitler was succeeded by Grand Admiral Karl D nitz as Reich President and Goebbels as Reich Chancellor  No one was to replace Hitler as the F hrer  a position Hitler abolished in his will  However  Goebbels committed suicide outside the Reich Chancellery a day after assuming office  The caretaker government D nitz established near the Danish border unsuccessfully sought a separate peace with the Western Allies  On 4 8 May 1945 most of the remaining German armed forces throughout Europe surrendered unconditionally  German Instrument of Surrender  1945   This was the end of World War II in Europe  The war was the largest and most destructive in human history  with 60 million dead across the world  54  including approximately 6 million Jews who perished during the Holocaust  55  3 million Soviet prisoners of war and at least 3 million civilian non Jewish victims of Nazi crimes  56  57  The Soviet Union lost around 27 million people during the war  58  about half of all World War II casualties  59  One in four Soviets were killed or wounded  60  The postwar Soviet population was 45 to 50 million smaller than it would have been if pre war demographic growth had continued  61  Towards the end of the war  Europe had more than 40 million refugees  62  the European economy had collapsed  and 70  of the European industrial infrastructure was destroyed  63  With the creation of the Allied Control Council on 5 July 1945  the four Allied powers  assume d  supreme authority with respect to Germany   Declaration Regarding

of a large part of Germany s remaining Saar region  The Allies each had its zone  which lasted until 1949  Berlin was also divided four ways  and remained under Allied control until 1990  64  The United Nations organized trials of Nazi leaders for war crimes and crimes against humanity  At the Nuremberg Trials  the first  major trial was the Trial of the Major War Criminals Before the International Military Tribunal  IMT   of 24 key Nazi officials including Hermann G ring  Ernst Kaltenbrunner  Rudolf Hess  Albert Speer  Karl D nitz  Hans Frank  and Julius Streicher  Most defendants were found guilty  12 were sentenced to execution  65  The victorious Allies outlawed the Nazi Party  its subsidiary organizations  and most of its symbols and emblems especially the swastika throughout Germany and Austria  this prohibition remains in force  The end of Nazi Germany also saw the rise in unpopularity of related aggressive manifestations of nationalism in Germany such as Pan Germanism and the V lkisch movement which had previously been significant political ideas there  and in other parts of Europe  before World War II  Those that remain are largely fringe movements  Hitler  Nazism  and the Holocaust are used as symbols of evil in the modern world  Newman and Erber  2002  wrote   The Nazis have become one of the most widely recognized images of modern evil  Throughout most of the world today  the concept of evil can readily be evoked by displaying almost any cue reminiscent of Nazism       66  Geography The German national borders in 1933 were those mapped out by the victors in World War I  at the Treaty of Versailles  1919   To the north  Germany was bounded by the North Sea  Denmark  and the Baltic Sea  to the east  it was divided into two and bordered Lithuania  the Free City of Danzig  Poland  and Czechoslovakia  to the south  it bordered Austria and Switzerland  and to the west  it touched France  Luxembourg  Belgium  the Netherlands  and the Saarland  These borders changed after Germany regained control of the Saarland  transformed itself into Greater Germany by annexing Austria in the Anschluss  1938   and also gained control of the Sudetenland  the remainder of Bohemia and Moravia  and the Memel Territory before the war  Germany expanded further by seizing even more land during World War II  which began in September 1939  Administrative regions of Greater German Reich in 1944  Territorial expansion of Germany from 1933 to 1943  Administration Main article  Administrative divisions of Nazi Germany To consolidate Adolf Hitler s control of Germany  in 1935  the Nazi r gime de facto replaced the administration of the L nder  constituent states  with gaus  regional districts  headed by governors answerable to the central Reich government in Berlin  The reorganization politically weakened Prussia  which had historically dominated German politics  Moreover  despite having centralised and assumed the Gau governments  some Nazis still retained leadership title to the different L nder  Hermann G ring was and remained the Reichsstatthalter  Reich state governor  and Minister President of Prussia until 1945  and Ludwig Siebert remained as Minister President of Bavaria  Territorial changes Main article  Territorial changes of Germany In the years leading to war  in addition to the Weimar Republic proper  the Reich came to include areas with ethnic German populations  such as Austria  the Czechoslovak Sudetenland  and the Lithuanian territory of Memel  the Klaip da Region   Regions conquered after the war s start include Eupen Malmedy  Alsace Lorraine  Danzig  and territories of Poland  Second Polish Republic   From 1939 to 1945  the Third Reich ruled the ethnically Czech parts of Czechoslovakia as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia  with its own currency  Czech Silesia was incorporated into the province of Silesia  and Luxembourg was a wartime annexation in 1940  Central Poland and Polish Galicia were governed by the German administered General Government  Eventually  the Polish people were to be removed  and Poland proper then re populated with 5 million Germans  By late 1943  Nazi Germany had conquered South Tyrol and Istria  which had been parts of Austria Hungary before 1919  and seized Trieste after the  erstwhile Axis Ally  Italian Fascist government capitulated to the Allies  Two puppet districts were set up in their place  the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral and the Operational Zone of the Alpine Foothills  Reichskommissariate Main article  Reichskommissariat Beyond the territories incorporated into Germany were the Reichskommissariate  Reich Commissariats   quasi colonial regimes established in a number of occupied countries and regions that were ruled by Nazi civilian administrators  Reichskommissars   Although  outside  of the Reich in a legal sense these were intended for eventual incorporation into it  most notably as sources for future Lebensraum  Nazi occupied Soviet Russia included the Reichskommissariat Ostland  encompassing the Baltic states  eastern parts of Poland  and western parts of Belarus  and a Reichskommissariat Ukraine  More such districts  the Reichskommissariat Moskowien for much of Western Russia  the Reichskommissariat Kaukasus for the Caucasus  and the Reichskommissariat Turkestan for Central Asia were also proposed in the event that they were brought under German rule  In Northern and Western Europe  the Germans established a Reichskommissariat Norwegen  Norway   and a Reichskommissariat Niederlande  the Netherlands   In June 1944 a Franco Belgian Reichskommissariat  derived from the previous Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France was also established to  facilitate  the area s intended annexation into Germany  This subsequently happened in December 1944  when it was split into three new Reichsgaue of the Greater German Reich  Flanders  Wallonia  and Brussels  This meant little in reality however as the majority of Belgium had already been liberated by the Allied forces at this point  although the Wehrmacht did make some small gains in retaking Wallonia during the Ardennes offensive  Hitler and other leading Nazi politicians believed that the non German Germanic peoples of Europe  such as the Scandinavians  the Dutch  and the Flemish  were part of the  Aryan master race   Hitler stated that he wanted to undo the  unnatural division  of the Nordic race into many different countries   Kleinstaatenger mpel    This was expanded on by Nazi ideologists  who made the analogy that since the union with Austria had transformed the German Reich into a Greater German Reich  Grossdeutsches Reich   so too would its union with the rest of historically Germanic Europe create a Greater Germanic Reich  Grossgermanisches Reich   The United Kingdom however was expected to be accorded a somewhat higher status  as partners in the Nazis  New Order rather than subjects  Hitler professed an admiration for the British Empire and its people as proof of Aryan superiority in Zweites Buch  Post war changes Main article  Territorial changes of Germany after World War II The de facto borders of the Reich changed long before its vanquishment in May 1945  as the Red Army progressed westwards  colonist German populaces fled to Germany proper  and as the Western Allies advanced eastwards from France  At war s end  a small strip of land  from Austria to Bohemia and Moravia  and other isolated regions  was the only area not occupied by the Allies  Upon its defeat  some historians have proposed that the Reich was in debellation  France  the Soviet Union  the United Kingdom  and the United States  established occupation zones  The prewar German lands east of the Oder Neisse line and Stettin  and environs  nearly 25 per cent of pre war German territory  were under Polish and Soviet administration  sundered for Polish

of Nazi Germany See also  Forced labour under German rule during World War II  Extermination through labor  Hunger Plan  and Economics of fascism Political economy of Nazi Germany 20 Reichsmark note In keeping with the political syncretism of fascism  the Nazi war economy was a mixed economy of free market and central planning practices  historian Richard Overy reports   The German economy fell between two stools  It was not enough of a command economy to do what the Soviet system could do  yet it was not capitalist enough to rely  as America did  on the recruitment of private enterprise   67  When the Nazis assumed German government  their most pressing economic matter was a national unemployment rate of approximately 30 per cent  68  at the start  Third Reich economic policies were the brainchildren of the economist Dr  Hjalmar Schacht  President of the Reichsbank  1933  and Minister of Economics  1934   who helped Reichskanzler Adolf Hitler implement Nazi redevelopment  reindustrialization  and rearmament of Germany  formerly  he had been Weimar Republic currency commissioner and Reichsbank president   68  As Economics Minister  Schacht was one of few ministers who took advantage of the administrative freedom allowed by the removal of the Reichsmark from the gold standard to maintain low interest rates  and high government deficits  the extensive national public works such as the Autobahns  reducing the unemployment  were deficit funded policy   68  The consequence of Economics Minister Schacht s administration was the extremely rapid unemployment rate decline  the greatest of any country during the Great Depression   68  Eventually  this Keynesian economic policy was supplemented by the increased production demands of warfare  inflating military budgets  and increasing government spending  the Reichswehr  100 000 in the army  expanded to millions  and was renamed the Wehrmacht in 1935  68  69  OST Arbeiter badge While the strict state intervention into the economy  and the massive rearmament policy  almost led to full employment during the 1930s  statistics didn t include non citizens or women   real wages in Germany dropped by roughly 25  between 1933 and 1938  68  Trade unions were abolished  as well as collective bargaining and the right to strike  68  The right to quit also disappeared  Labour books were introduced in 1935  and required the consent of the previous employer in order to be hired for another job  68  Employment Record Book for the foreigners Nazi control of business retained a diminished investment profit incentive  controlled with economic regulation concording a company s functioning with the Reich s national production requirements  Government financing eventually dominated private investment  in the 1933 34 biennium  the proportion of private securities issued diminished from more than 50 per cent of the total  to approximately 10 per cent in the 1935 38 quadrennium  Heavy profit taxes limited self financing companies  and the largest companies  usually government contractors  mostly were exempted from paying taxes on profits in practice  Peter Temin writes that government control allowed  only the shell of private ownership  in the Third Reich economy  70  By contrast  Christoph Buchheim and Jonas Scherner counter that despite state control  business had much production and investment planning freedom   while the economy was still to a larger degree politically controlled it  does not necessarily mean that private property of enterprises was not of any significance       For despite extensive regulatory activity by an interventionist public administration  firms preserved a good deal of their autonomy even under the Nazi regime   71  In 1937  Hermann G ring replaced Schacht as Minister of Economics  and introduced the Four Year Plan that would establish German self sufficiency for war within four years by curtailing foreign importations  fixing wages and prices  violators merited concentration camp internment   stock dividends were restricted to six per cent on book capital  et cetera  Strategic goals were to be achieved regardless of cost  as in Soviet economics   thus the rapid construction of synthetic rubber factories  steel mills  automatic textile mills  et cetera   68  The Four Year Plan is discussed in the German expansion Hossbach Memorandum

Plan s expiry was not until 1940  to control the Reich economy  Economics Minister G ring had established the Office of the Four Year Plan  Wartime In 1942  after the death of Fritz Todt  Hitler named his favourite architect  Albert Speer  in charge of the domestic economy  72  Speer established a war economy in Nazi Germany  which reduced civilian consumptions and made the war economy more efficient  73  By 1944  the war was consuming 75  of German GDP  compared to 60  in the Soviet Union  55  in Britain  and 45  in the U S  74  The highest high priority went to the manufacture of warplanes  which had been poorly coordinated and relied too heavily on skilled workers  who were in short supply  Speer produced a dramatic rise in production after 1942  His methods included streamlined organization  the use of single purpose machines operated by unskilled workers  and the rationalization of production methods  and better coordination between the many different forms that made tens of thousands of components  Factories were relocated away from rail yards which were bombing targets  The system finally caught up with British production by 1944  but by then it was far too late and gasoline supplies meant the new warplanes had little flying time  75  76  The economy now relied heavily upon the large scale employment of forced labourers  To help operate the factories and farms  Germany took in some 12 million people  from some 20 European countries  approximately 75 per cent were Eastern European  77  They worked long hours  typically in munitions factories  many were assigned to clearing rubble after bombing raids  They received poor air raid protection  and many were casualties of Allied bombing  The very bad living conditions produced high rates of sickness  in jury and death  as well as sabotage and criminality  78  Women played an increasingly large role  Hagemann reports that in 1944 over a half million served as auxiliaries in the German armed forces  especially in anti aircraft units of the Luftwaffe  a half million worked in civil aerial defense  and 400 000 were volunteer nurses in hospitals  Large numbers replaced drafted men in the wartime economy  especially on farms and in small family owned shops  79  Very heavy strategic bombing by the U S  and Britain focused on the German transportation system  especially rail yards 80   canals  and refineries making synthetic oil and gasoline  The Luftwaffe tried to defend those targets but in turn was itself destroyed  Oil  diesel and gasoline supplies dried up by late 1944  and the railways were so disrupted that the economy went into a death spiral  81  Overy argues that the bombing created not only major social dislocation but a defensive response that strained the German war economy and forced it to divert up to one fourth of its manpower and industry into anti aircraft resources  Overy concludes the bombing campaign probably shortened the war  82  Politics Main article  Adolf Hitler The Nazi state idolized Hitler as its F hrer   Leader    centralizing all power in his hands  Nazi propaganda centered on Hitler and created what historians call the  Hitler Myth    that Hitler was all wise and that any mistakes or failures by others would be corrected when brought to his attention  In reality  Hitler had a narrow range of interests  and decision making was diffused among overlapping  feuding power centers  on some issues he was passive  simply assenting to pressures from whoever had his ear  Top officials reported to Hitler and followed his basic policies  but they had considerable autonomy on a daily basis  83  Through staffing of most government positions with Nazi Party members  by 1935 the German national government and the Nazi Party had become virtually one and the same  By 1938  through the policy of Gleichschaltung  local and state governments lost all legislative power and answered administratively to Nazi Party leaders  known as Gauleiters  who governed Gaue and Reichsgaue  Government See also  Hitler s subversion of the Weimar Constitution and Flensburg Government Nazi Germany was made up of various competing power structures  all trying to gain favor with the F hrer  Adolf Hitler  Thus many existing laws were stricken and replaced with interpretations of what Hitler wanted  Any high party government official could take one of Hitler s comments and turn it into a new law  of which Hitler would casually either approve or disapprove  This became known as  working towards the F hrer   as the government was not a coordinated  co operating body  but a collection of individuals each trying to gain more power and influence through the F hrer  This often made government very convoluted and divided  especially with Hitler s vague policy of creating similar posts with overlapping powers and authority  The process allowed the more unscrupulous and ambitious Nazis to get away with implementing the more radical and extreme elements of Hitler s ideology  such as anti Semitism  and in doing so win political favor  Protected by Goebbels  extremely effective propaganda machine  which portrayed the government as a dedicated  dutiful and efficient outfit  the dog eat dog competition and chaotic legislation was allowed to escalate  Historical opinion is divided between  intentionalists   who believe that Hitler created this system as the only means of ensuring both the total loyalty and dedication of his supporters and the impossibility of a conspiracy  and  structuralists   who believe that the system evolved by itself and was a limitation on Hitler s supposedly totalitarian power  Executive Cabinets Cabinet Hitler Cabinet Schwerin von Krosigk National authorities Office of the

Arthur Seyss Inquart  State ideology Main article  Nazism National Socialism had some of the key ideological elements of fascism which originally developed in Italy under Benito Mussolini  however  the Nazis never officially declared themselves fascists  Both ideologies involved the political use of militarism  nationalism  anti communism and paramilitary forces  and both intended to create a dictatorial state  citation needed  The Nazis  however  were far more racially oriented than the fascists in Italy  Portugal  and Spain  The Nazis were also intent on creating a completely totalitarian state  unlike Italian fascists who while promoting a totalitarian state  allowed a larger degree of private liberties for their citizens  These differences allowed the Italian monarchy to continue to exist and have some official powers  However the Nazis copied much of their symbolism from the Fascists in Italy  such as copying the Roman salute as the Nazi salute  use of mass rallies  both made use of uniformed paramilitaries devoted to the party  the SA in Germany and the Blackshirts in Italy   both Hitler and Mussolini were called the  Leader   F hrer in German  Duce in Italian   both were anti Communist  both wanted an ideologically driven state  and both advocated a middle way between capitalism and communism  commonly known as corporatism  The party itself rejected the fascist label  claiming National Socialism was an ideology unique to Germany  The totalitarian nature of the Nazi party was one of its principal tenets  The Nazis contended that all the great achievements in the past of the German nation and its people were associated with the ideals of National Socialism  even before the ideology officially existed  Propaganda accredited the consolidation of Nazi ideals and successes of the regime to the regime s F hrer   Leader    Adolf Hitler  who was portrayed as the genius behind the Nazi party s success and Germany s saviour  To secure their ability to create a totalitarian state  the Nazi party s paramilitary force  the Sturmabteilung  SA  or  Storm Detachment  used acts of violence against leftists  communists  democrats  Jews and other opposition or minority groups  The SA  storm troopers  violently clashed with the Communist Party of Germany  German Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands   KPD  which created a climate of lawlessness and fear  In the cities  people were anxious over punishment or even death  if they displayed opposition to the Nazis  Given the frustrations of the people  after World War I and during the Great Depression  it was easy for the SA to attract large numbers of alienated  and unemployed  youth and working class people for the party  The  German problem   as it is often referred to in English scholarship  focuses on the issue of administration of Germanic regions in Northern and Central Europe  an important theme throughout German history  84  The  logic  of keeping Germany small worked in the favor of its principal economic rivals  and had been a driving force in the recreation of a Polish state  citation needed  The goal was to create numerous counterweights in order to  balance out Germany s power   The Nazis endorsed the concept of Gro deutschland  or Greater Germany  and believed that the incorporation of the Germanic people into one nation was a vital step towards their national success  citation needed  It was the Nazis  passionate support of the Volk concept of Greater Germany that led to Germany s expansion  that gave legitimacy and the support needed for the Third Reich to proceed to conquer long lost territories with overwhelmingly non German population like former Prussian gains in Poland that it lost to Russia in the 19th century  or to acquire territories with German population like parts of Austria  The German concept of Lebensraum or more specifically its need for an expanding German population was also claimed by the Nazi regime for territorial expansion  Two important issues were administration of the Polish corridor and Danzig s incorporation into the Reich  As a further extension of racial policy  the Lebensraum program pertained to similar interests  the Nazis determined that Eastern Europe would be settled with ethnic Germans  and the Slavic population who met the Nazi racial standard would be absorbed into the Reich  Those not fitting the racial standard were to be used as cheap labour force or deported eastward  85  Racialism and racism were important aspects of society within the Third Reich  The Nazis combined anti Semitism with anti Communist ideology  regarding the leftist internationalist movement as well as international market capitalism as the work of  Conspiratorial Jewry   They referred to this so called movement with terminology such as the  Jewish Bolshevistic revolution of subhumans   86  This platform manifested itself in the displacement  internment  and systematic extermination of an estimated 11 million to 12 million people in the midst of World War II  roughly half of them being Jews targeted in what is historically remembered as the Holocaust  Shoah   3 million ethnic Poles that died as a result of warfare  genocide  reprisals  forced labor or famine  87  and another 100 000 1 000 000 being Roma  who were murdered in the Porajmos  Other victims of Nazi persecution included communists  various political opponents  social outcasts  homosexuals  freethinkers  religious dissidents such as Jehovah s Witnesses  Christadelphians  the Confessing Church and Freemasons  88  Foreign relations Foreign relations between Germany and the rest of Europe were riddled with political maneuvers and opportunistic decisions  Fearing a second world war  Britain and France sought a policy of appeasement towards Germany  and refused aggressive foreign policies to satisfy the newly empowered Nazis  Hitler s aims upon coming to power was threefold  destroy Versailles  re unite lost German territories under the decrees of Versailles  and Lebensraum  It is said that Hitler wanted Britain as an ally with wars with the USSR  and eventually the USA  Hitler used the Appeasement policies of Britain and France to his opportunistic advantage when he announced in March 1935 that he would conscript men into his army and create the Luftwaffe  both a direct violation of Versailles  His foreign policies were designed to test the nerve of Britain and France so he could see what else he was able to get away with  His other concern was Italy  whom under Mussolini had become a similarly fascist country  but had so much internal civil disruption Hitler wanted a more stable and powerful ally  Although Germany s relations with Italy improved with creation of the Rome Berlin Axis  tensions remained high because the Nazis wanted Austria to be incorporated into Germany  Italy was opposed to this  as were France and Britain  In 1938  an Austrian led Nazi coup took place in Austria and Germany sent in its troops  annexing the country  Italy and Britain no longer had common interests and  as Germany had stopped supporting the German speaking population under Italy s control in South Tyrol  Italy began to gravitate towards Germany  Hitler  center  with  from left to right  Neville Chamberlain   douard Daladier  Benito Mussolini  and Galeazzo Ciano pictured before signing the Munich Agreement  Germany s annexation of the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia in September 1938 came about during talks with British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain  in which Hitler  backed by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini  demanded that the German territories be ceded  Chamberlain and Hitler came to an agreement when Hitler signed a piece of paper which said that with the annexation of the Sudetenland  Germany would proceed with no further territorial aims  Chamberlain took this to be a success in that it avoided a potential war with Germany  However  the Nazis helped to promote Slovakian dissention and declaring that the country was no more  seized control of the Czech part  For quite some time  Germany had engaged in informal negotiations with Poland regarding the issue of territorial revision  but after the Munich Agreement and the reacquisition of Memel  the Nazis became increasingly vocal  Poland refused to allow the annexation of the Free City of Danzig  Germany and the Soviet Union began talks over planning an invasion of Poland  In August 1939  the Molotov Pact was signed and Germany and the Soviet Union agreed to divide Poland along a mutually agreed set boundary  The invasion was put into effect on 1 September 1939  Last minute Polish German diplomatic proceedings failed  and Germany invaded Poland as scheduled  Germany alleged that Polish operatives had attacked German positions  but the result was the outbreak of World War II in Europe  as Allied forces refused to accept Germany s claims on Poland and blamed Germany for the conflict  From 1939 1940  the so called  Phoney War  occurred  as German forces made no further advances but instead  both the Axis and Allies engaged in a propaganda campaign  However in early 1940  Germany began to concern that the British intended to stop trade between Sweden and Germany by bringing Norway into an alliance against Germany  with Norway in Allied hands  the Allies would be dangerously close to German territory  In response  Germany invaded Denmark and Norway ending the Phoney War  leapfrogging the British invasion troops bound towards Norway by just 24 hours   After sweeping through the Low Countries and occupying northern France  Germany allowed French nationalist and war hero Philippe Petain to form a fascist regime in southern France known as the  French State  but more commonly referred to as Vichy France named after its capital in Vichy  On 23 October 1940 Hitler and Francisco Franco  the dictator of Spain  met in Hendaye to discuss Spain entering the war  Franco asked too much from Hitler  Even though Spain would remain neutral during World War II Spain and Nazi Germany would remain allies during the war  Spain would send volunteer soldiers to fight for Germany but only against the Soviet Union  Spain was subsequently isolated following the war until re aligning towards economic liberalism and a pro Western foreign policy in the 1950s  citation needed  In 1941  Germany s invasion of Yugoslavia resulted in that state s splintering  In spite of Hitler s earlier view of inferiority of all Slavs  he supported Mussolini s agenda of creating a fascist puppet state of Croatia  called the Independent State of Croatia  Croatia was led by the extreme nationalist Ante Paveli  a long time Croatian exile in Rome  whose Ustashe movement formed a government in modern day Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina  The Ustashe were allowed to persecute Serbs  while Germany contributed to that goal in German occupied Serbia  From 1941 to the end of the war  Germany engaged in war with the Soviet Union in its attempt to create the Nazi colonial goal of Lebensraum for German citizens  The German occupation authorities set up occupation and colonial authorities called Reichskommissariats such as Reichskommissariat Ostland and Reichskommissariat Ukraine  The Slavic populations were to be destroyed along with Jews there to make way for German colonists  As the fortunes of war changed  Germany was forced to occupy Italy when Mussolini was thrown out as Prime Minister by Italy s king in 1943  German forces rescued Mussolini and instructed him to establish a fascist regime in Italy called the Italian Social Republic  This was the last major foreign policy delivered  The remainder of the war saw the decline of German power and desperate attempts by Nazi officials such as Heinrich Himmler to negotiate a peace with the western Allies against the wishes of Hitler  See also  German Japanese relations Law Main articles  Law of Germany  Reichstag  Weimar Republic   and Reichsrat  Germany  Most of the judicial structures and legal codes of the Weimar Republic remained in use during and after the Third Reich  but significant changes within the judicial codes occurred  as well as significant changes in court rulings  The Nazi party was the only legal political party in Germany and all other political parties were banned  Most human rights of the constitution of the Weimar Republic were disabled by several Reichsgesetze   Reich s laws    Several minorities such as the Jews  opposition politicians and prisoners of war were deprived of most of their rights and responsibilities  The Plan to pass a Volksstrafgesetzbuch   people s code of criminal justice   arose soon after 1933  but didn t come into reality until the end of World War II  As a new type of court  the Volksgerichtshof   people s court   was established in 1934  only dealing with cases of political importance  From 1934   September 1944  a total of 5 375 death sentences were spoken by the court  Not included in this numbers are the death sentences from 20 July 1944   April 1945  which are estimated at 2 000  Its most prominent jurist was Roland Freisler  who headed the court from August 1942   February 1945  Military Waffen SS troops in 1939 Main articles  Wehrmacht  Heer  1935 1945   Kriegsmarine  Luftwaffe  and Waffen SS The military of the Third Reich   the Wehrmacht   was the name of the unified armed forces of Germany from 1935 1945 with Heer  army   Kriegsmarine  navy   Luftwaffe  air force  and a military organization Waffen SS  military branch of the SS  which was  de facto  a fourth branch of the Wehrmacht   89  The German Army furthered concepts pioneered during World War I  combining Ground and Air Force assets into combined arms teams  Coupled with traditional war fighting methods such as encirclements and the  battle of annihilation   the German military managed many lightning quick victories in the first year of World War II  prompting foreign journalists to create a new word for what they witnessed  Blitzkrieg  The total number of soldiers who served in the Wehrmacht during its existence from 1935 1945 is believed to approach 18 2 million  Officially  roughly 5 3 million German soldiers died in the course of the war  90  Racial policy Jewish shops were vandalized to warn people not to buy there The aftermath of Kristallnacht  Jewish shops vandalized Naked Soviet POWs in Mauthausen concentration camp  Between June 1941 and January 1942  the Nazis killed an estimated 2 8 million Red Army POWs  whom they viewed as  subhuman   91  Senator Alben W  Barkley  a member of the US Congressional Nazi crimes committee visiting Buchenwald concentration camp shortly after its liberation Main articles  The Holocaust and Racial policy of Nazi Germany From the very earliest speeches and writings of Hitler  it was clear that the Jewish community in Germany were an object of hatred  92  Nazi ideology laid down strict rules about who was or was not a pure German  and actions were set into motion to purify the German race soon after the Nazi takeover  On 1 April 1933  Hitler declared a national boycott of Jewish places of business  93  Many Jewish families prepared to leave  but many others hoped that as they were German citizens  their livelihoods and property would be safe  In 1935 the Nuremberg Laws were enacted  depriving Jews of their German citizenship  Marriage between Jews and Aryans was forbidden  Further rights were lost over the next few years  Jews were excluded from many professions and from shopping at many stores  Many towns posted signs forbidding the entry of Jews  94  In November 1938  a young Jewish male in Paris requested an interview with the German ambassador and was shown in to a meeting with a legation secretary  whom he shot in protest against the treatment meted out to his family in Germany  By coincidence  both men were from Frankfurt and knew each other slightly  The attempt was used by the Nazi Party to stir up hatred against the Jewish communities in Germany  The SA was given the task of attacking synagogues and Jewish property throughout Germany  During Kristallnacht  the Night of Broken Glass  95  at least ninety one German Jews were killed and Jewish property throughout was destroyed  This phase of exclusion made it very clear that the Jews in Germany were to be targeted in the future  To further illustrate  the Jewish communities were fined one billion marks and told that they would not receive compensation for their losses  The effects of Nazi social policy in Germany was divided between those considered to be  Aryan  and those considered  non Aryan   Jewish  or part of other minority groups  For  Aryan  Germans  a number of social policies put through by the regime to benefit them were advanced for the time  including state opposition to the use of tobacco  an end to official stigmatization toward Aryan children who were born from parents outside of marriage  as well as giving financial assistance to Aryan German families who bore children  96  The Nazi Party pursued its racial and social policies through persecution and killing of those considered social undesirables or  enemies of the Reich   Especially targeted were minority groups such as Jews  Romani  also known as Gypsies   Jehovah s Witnesses  97  people with mental or physical disabilities and homosexuals  In the 1930s  plans to isolate and eventually eliminate Jews completely in Germany began with the construction of ghettos  concentration camps  and labour camps which began with the 1933 construction of the Dachau concentration camp  which Heinrich Himmler officially described as  the first concentration camp for political prisoners   98  In the years following the Nazi rise to power  many Jews were encouraged to leave the country and did so  By the time the Nuremberg Laws were passed in 1935  Jews were stripped of their German citizenship and denied government employment  Most Jews employed by Germans lost their jobs at this time  which were being taken by unemployed Germans  Notably  the government attempted to send 17 000 German Jews of Polish descent back to Poland  a decision which led to the assassination of Ernst vom Rath by Herschel Grynszpan  a German Jew living in France  This provided the pretext for a pogrom the Nazi Party incited against the Jews on 9 November 1938  which specifically targeted Jewish businesses  The event was called Kristallnacht  Night of Broken Glass  literally  Crystal Night    the euphemism was used because the numerous broken windows made the streets look as if covered with crystals  By September 1939  more than 200 000 Jews had left Germany  with the government seizing any property they left behind  The Nazis also undertook programs targeting  weak  or  unfit  people  such as the T 4 Euthanasia Program  killing tens of thousands of disabled and sick Germans in an effort to  maintain the purity of the German Master race   German  Herrenvolk  as described by Nazi propagandists  The techniques of mass killing developed in these efforts would later be used in the Holocaust  Under a law passed in 1933  the Nazi regime carried out the compulsory sterilization of over 400 000 individuals labeled as having hereditary defects  ranging from mental illness to alcoholism  Another component of the Nazi programme of creating racial purity was the Lebensborn  or  Fountain of Life  programme founded in 1935  The programme was aimed at encouraging German soldiers mainly SS to reproduce  This included offering SS families support services  including the adoption of racially pure children into suitable SS families  and accommodating racially valuable women  pregnant with mainly SS men s children  in care homes in Germany and throughout Occupied Europe  Lebensborn also expanded to encompass the placing of racially pure children forcibly seized from occupied countries such as Poland with German families  citation needed  In 1941 it was decided to destroy the Polish nation completely and the German leadership decided that in 10 to 20 years the Polish state under German occupation was to be fully cleared of any ethnic Poles and settled by German colonists  99  The Nazis considered Jews  Romani people  Poles along with other Slavic people like the Russians  Ukrainians  Czechs and anyone else who was not an  Aryan  according to the contemporary Nazi race terminology to be Untermenschen   subhumans    The Nazis rationalized that the  Aryan  Germans had a biological right to displace  eliminate and enslave inferiors  100  101  After the war  under the  Big Plan   Generalplan Ost foresaw the deportation of 45 million non Germanizable people from Eastern Europe  85  of Poles  Belorussians  75   and Ukrainians  65    to West Siberia  102  and about 14 millions were to remain  but were to be treated as slaves  103  104  In their place  Germans would be settled in an extended lebensraum of the 1000 Year Empire  105  Herbert Backe was one of the orchestrators of the Hunger Plan   the plan to starve tens of millions of Slavs in order to ensure steady food supplies for the German people and troops  106  In the longer term  107  the Nazis wanted to exterminate some 30 45 million Slavs  108  According to Michael Dorland   As Yale historian Timothy Snyder reminds us  had the Nazis succeeded in their war on Russia  the implementation of two further dimensions of the Holocaust  the Hunger Plan and Generalplan Ost  would have led to the elimination through starvation of an additional 80 million people in Belarus  northern Russia and the USSR   109  At the outset of World War II  the German authority in the General Government in occupied Poland ordered that all Jews face compulsory labour and that those who were physically incapable such as women and children were to be confined to ghettos  110  To the Nazis  a number of ideas appeared on how to answer the  Jewish Question   One method was a mass forced deportation of Jews  Adolf Eichmann suggested that Jews be forced to emigrate to Palestine  110 Franz Rademacher made the proposal that Jews be deported to Madagascar  this proposal was supported by Himmler and was discussed by Hitler and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini but was later dismissed as impractical in 1942  110  The idea of continuing deportations to occupied Poland was rejected by the governor  Hans Frank  of the General Government of occupied Poland as Frank refused to accept any more deportations of Jews to the territory which already had large numbers of Jews  110  In 1942  at the Wannsee Conference  Nazi officials decided to eliminate the Jews altogether  as discussed the  Final Solution of the Jewish Question   Concentration camps like Auschwitz were converted and used gas chambers to kill as many Jews as possible  By 1945  a number of concentration camps had been liberated by Allied forces and they found the survivors to be severely malnourished  The Allies also found evidence that the Nazis were profiteering from the mass murder of Jews not only by confiscating their property and personal valuables but also by extracting gold fillings from the bodies of some Jews held in concentration camps  Social policy Education Further information  University education in Nazi Germany Education under the Nazi regime focused on racial biology  population policy  culture  geography and especially physical fitness  111  Military education  Wehrerziehung  became the central component of physical education in order to prepare the Germans mentally  spiritually and physically for warfare  112  science textbooks presented natural selection in terms meant to underline the concept of racial purity  113  Anti Semitic policy led to the expulsion in 1933 all of Jewish teachers  professors and officials from the education system  Likewise  politically undesirable teachers  such as socialists  were expelled as part of the  Law for the Restoration of the Civil Service   Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufbeamtentums   Most teachers were required to belong to the National Socialist Teachers  Association  Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund   NSLB   114  All university professors were required to be a member in good standing of the National Socialist Association of University Lecturers  115  The teaching methods promoted under National Socialism were experiential and active in their orientation  This was largely an extension of the anti intellectual attitude of the Nazi leadership  however  and not primarily an attempt to experiment with new didactic methods  As Henrich Hansen  the head of the NS Teachers  Association  put it   The youth of Germany will no longer be  objectively  posed with the choice between an upbringing that is materialistic or idealistic  ethnic  V lkish  or international  religious or godless  rather it will be consciously formed according to principles that have shown themselves to be true  the principles of the national socialist worldview  116  In seeking a way to make education less abstract  less intellectual and less distant from children  educators called for a much expanded role for film  Reichsfilmintendant and Head of the Film Section in the Propaganda Ministry Fritz Hippler wrote that film affects people  primarily on the optical and emotional  that is to say  non intellectual  level  117  Film also appealed to the Nazi leadership as a medium through which they could speak directly to children  Dr  Bernhard Rust saw film as an essential tool  saying  The National Socialist State definitely and deliberately makes the film the transmitter of its ideology   118  Social welfare Recent research by academics such as G tz Aly has emphasized the role of the extensive Nazi social welfare programs that focused on providing employment for German citizens and insuring a minimal living standard for German citizens  Heavily focused on was the idea of a national German community or Volksgemeinschaft  119  To aid the fostering of a feeling of community  the German people s labour and entertainment experiences from festivals  to vacation trips and traveling cinemas were all made a part of the  Strength Through Joy   Kraft durch Freude  KdF  program  Also crucial to the building of loyalty and comradeship was the implementation of the National Labour Service and the Hitler Youth Organization  with compulsory membership  In addition to this  a number of architectural projects were undertaken  KdF created the KdF wagen  later known as the Volkswagen   People s Car    which was designed to be an automobile that every German citizen would be able to afford  With the outbreak of World War II the car was converted into a military vehicle and civilian production was stopped  Another national project undertaken was the construction of the Autobahn  which made it the first freeway system in the world  The Winter Relief campaigns not only collected charity for the unfortunate  but acted as a ritual to generate public feeling  120  As part of the centralization of Nazi Germany  posters urged people to donate rather to give directly to beggars  121  Health According to the research of Robert N  Proctor for his book The Nazi War on Cancer  122  123  Nazi Germany had arguably the most powerful anti tobacco movement in the world  Anti tobacco research received a strong backing from the government  and German scientists proved that cigarette smoke could cause cancer  German pioneering research on experimental epidemiology led to the 1939 paper by Franz H  M ller  and the 1943 paper by Eberhard Schairer and Erich Sch niger which convincingly demonstrated that tobacco smoking was a main culprit in lung cancer  The government urged German doctors to counsel patients against tobacco use  German research on the dangers of tobacco was silenced after the war  and the dangers of tobacco had to be rediscovered by American and English scientists in the early 1950s  with a medical consensus arising in the early 1960s  German scientists also proved that asbestos was a health hazard  and in 1943 as the first nation in the world to offer such a benefit Germany recognized the diseases caused by asbestos  e g   lung cancer  as occupational illnesses eligible for compensation  The German asbestos cancer research was later used by American lawyers doing battle against the Johns Manville Corporation  As part of the general public health campaign in Nazi Germany  water supplies were cleaned up  lead and mercury were removed from consumer products  and women were urged to undergo regular screenings for breast cancer  123  124  The Nazi health care system also held as a central idea the concept of Eugenics  Certain people were deemed  genetically inferior  and were targeted for elimination from the gene pool through sterilization  Hereditary Health Courts  or wholesale murder  Action T4   Medical information professionals used new processes and technology  like punch card systems  and cost analysis  to aid in the process and calculate the  benefit  to society of these killings  125  Women s rights Women in the Third Reich were a cornerstone of Nazi social policy  however  this meant a sharp curtailment of women s rights  The Nazis opposed the feminist movement  claiming that it had a left wing agenda  comparable to Communism  and was bad for both women and men  The Nazi regime advocated a patriarchal society in which German women would recognize the  world is her husband  her family  her children  and her home   126  Hitler claimed that women taking vital jobs away from men during the Great Depression was economically bad for families in that women were paid only 66 percent of what men earned  126  Simultaneously with calling for women to leave work outside the home  the regime called for women to be actively supportive of the state regarding women s affairs  In 1933  Hitler appointed Gertrud Scholtz Klink as the Reich Women s Leader  who instructed women that their primary role in society was to bear children and that women should be subservient to men  once saying  the mission of woman is to minister in the home and in her profession to the needs of life from the first to last moment of man s existence    126  The expectation even applied to Aryan women married to Jewish men a necessary ingredient in the 1943 Rosenstrasse protest in which 1800 German women  joined by 4200 relatives  obliged the Nazi state to release their Jewish husbands  This position was so strongly held as to make it extremely difficult to recruit women for war jobs during World War II  127  The Nazi regime discouraged women from seeking higher education in secondary schools  universities and colleges  The number of women allowed to enroll in universities dropped drastically under the Nazi regime  which shrank from approximately 128 000 women being enrolled in 1933 to 51 000 in 1938  Female enrollment in secondary schools dropped from 437 000 in 1926 to 205 000 in 1937  However with the requirement of men to be enlisted into the German armed forces during the war  women made up half of the enrollment in the education system by 1944  128  On the other hand  the women were expected to be strong  healthy  and vital  a photograph subtitled  Future Mothers  showed teenage girls dressed for sport and bearing javelins  129  A sturdy peasant woman  who worked the land and bore strong children  was an ideal  contributing to praise for athletic women tanned by outdoor work  130  Organizations were made for the indoctrination of Nazi values to German women  Such organizations included the Jungm del   Young Girls   section of the Hitler Youth for girls from the age 10 to 14  the Bund Deutscher M del  BDM   German Girls  League   for young women from 14 to 18  and the NS Frauenschaft  a woman s organization  The NS Frauenschaft put out the NS Frauen Warte  the only approved women s magazine in Nazi Germany  131  Despite its propaganda aspects  it was predominantly a woman s magazine  132  even including sewing patterns  133  The BDM s activities encompassed physical education  including running  the long jump  somersaulting  tightrope walking  rout marching  and swimming  134 Das deutsche M del was less adventure oriented than the boy s Der Pimpf  135  but far more emphasis was laid on strong and active German women than in NS Frauen Warte  132  Also  before entering any occupation or advanced studies  the girls  like the boys in Hitler Youth  had to complete a year of land service  136  Despite the somewhat official restrictions  some women forged highly visible  as well as officially praised  achievements  such as the aviatrix Hanna Reitsch and film director Leni Riefenstahl  On the issue of sexual affairs regarding women  Biddiscombe argues the Nazis differed greatly from the restrictive stances on women s role in society  The Nazi regime promoted a liberal code of conduct as regards sexual matters  and were sympathetic to women bearing children out of wedlock  96  The collapse of 19th century morals in Germany accelerated during the Third Reich  partly due to the Nazis  and greatly due to the effects of the war  Promiscuity increased greatly as the war progressed  with unmarried soldiers often involved intimately with several women simultaneously  Married women were often involved in multiple affairs simultaneously  with soldiers  civilians or slave labourers   Some farm wives in W rttemberg had already begun using sex as a commodity  employing carnal favours as a means of getting a full day s work from foreign labourers   96  Nevertheless  publically  Nazi propaganda opposed adultery and upheld the sancticity of marriage  137  Several films shot in this era altered their source material so that the woman  rather than the man  would suffer death for sexual transgressions  reflecting whose fault it was held to be  138  When attempts were made to destigmatize illegitimate births  Lebensborn homes were presented the public as for married women  139  Overtly anti marriage statements  such as Himmler s statements regarding the care of the illegimate children of dead soldiers  were greeted with protests  140  Ilsa McKee noted that the lectures of Hitler Youth and the BDM on the need to produce more children produced several illegitimate children  which neither the mothers nor the possible fathers regarded as problematic  141  Marriage or sexual relations between a person considered  Aryan  and one that was not were classified as Rassenschande and were forbidden and under penalty  Aryans found guilty could face incarceration in a concentration camp  while non Aryans could face the death penalty   Pamphlets enjoined all German women to avoid sexual intercourse with all foreign workers brought to Germany as a danger to their blood  142  Abortion was heavily penalized in Nazi Germany unless on the grounds of  racial health   from 1943 abortionists faced the death penalty  143  Display of contraceptives was not allowed  and Hitler himself described contraception as  violation of nature  as degradation of womanhood  motherhood and love   144  Environmentalism In 1935  the regime enacted the  Reich Nature Protection Act   While not a purely Nazi piece of legislation  as parts of its influences pre dated the Nazi rise to power  it nevertheless reflected Nazi ideology  The concept of the Dauerwald  best translated as the  perpetual forest   which included concepts such as forest management and protection was promoted and efforts were also made to curb air pollution  145  146  Hermann G ring was an avid hunter In practice  the enacted laws and policies met resistance from various ministries that sought to undermine them  and from the priority that the war effort took to environmental protection  Animal protection policy Main article  Animal welfare in Nazi Germany The Nazis had elements which were supportive of animal rights  zoos and wildlife  147  and took several measures to ensure their protection  148  In 1933 the government enacted a stringent animal protection law  149  150  Many NSDAP leaders  including Hitler and G ring  were supporters of animal protection  Several Nazis were environmentalists  notably Rudolf Hess   and species protection and animal welfare were significant issues in the regime  151  Himmler made efforts to ban the hunting of animals  152  G ring was an animal lover and conservationist  153  The current animal welfare laws in Germany are adapted from laws introduced by the National Socialist regime  154  Although enacting various laws for animal protection  there was a lack of enforcement  According to Pfugers Archiv f r die Gesamte Physiologie  Pfugers Archive for the Total Physiology   a science journal at that time  there were many animal experiments during the Nazi regime  155  The Nazi regime disbanded several unofficial organizations advocating environmentalism and animal protection  such as the Friends of Nature  156  Culture Main articles  Art of the Third Reich and List of authors banned during the Third Reich The regime sought to restore traditional values in German culture  The art and culture that came to define the Weimar Republic years was repressed  The visual arts were strictly monitored and traditional  focusing on exemplifying Germanic themes  racial purity  militarism  heroism  power  strength  and obedience  Modern abstract art and avant garde art was removed from museums and put on special display as  degenerate art   where it was to be ridiculed  In one notable example  on 31 March 1937  huge crowds stood in line to view a special display of  degenerate art  in Munich  Art forms considered to be degenerate included Dada  Cubism  Expressionism  Fauvism  Impressionism  New Objectivity  and Surrealism  Literature written by Jewish  other non Aryans  homosexual or authors opposed to the Nazis was destroyed by the regime  The most infamous destruction of literature was the book burnings by German students in 1933  In 1933  Nazis burned works considered  un German  in Berlin which included books by Jewish authors  political opponents  and other works which did not align with Nazi ideology  Nazi propaganda poster   Danzig is German   Despite the official attempt to forge a pure Germanic culture  one major area of the arts  architecture  under Hitler s personal guidance  was neoclassical  a style based on architecture of ancient Rome  157  This style stood out in stark contrast and opposition to newer  more liberal  and more popular architecture styles of the time such as Art Deco  Various Roman buildings were examined by state architect Albert Speer for architectural designs for state buildings  Speer constructed huge and imposing structures such as in the Nazi party rally grounds in Nuremberg and the new Reich Chancellery building in Berlin  One design that was pursued  but never built  was a gigantic version of the Pantheon in Rome  called the Volkshalle to be the semi religious centre of Nazism in a renamed Berlin called Germania  which was to be the  world capital   Welthauptstadt   Also to be constructed was a Triumphal arch  several times larger than that found in Paris  which was also based upon a classical styling  Many of the designs for Germania were impractical to construct because of their size and the marshy soil underneath Berlin  later the materials that were to be used for construction were diverted to the war effort  Cinema and media Main articles  Cinema of Germany  List of German films 1933 1945  Nazism and cinema  Panorama  German wartime newsreel   and Propagandaministerium The majority of German films of the period were intended principally as works of entertainment  The import of foreign films was legally restricted after 1936  and the German industry  which was effectively nationalised in 1937  had to make up for the missing foreign films  above all American productions   Entertainment also became increasingly important in the later years of World War II when the cinema provided a distraction from Allied bombing and a string of German defeats  In both 1943 and 1944 cinema admissions in Germany exceeded a billion  158  and the biggest box office hits of the war years were Die gro e Liebe  1942  and Wunschkonzert  1941   which both combine elements of the musical  wartime romance and patriotic propaganda  Frauen sind doch bessere Diplomaten  1941   a comic musical which was one of the earliest German films in colour  and Wiener Blut  1942   the adaptation of a Johann Strau  comic operetta  The importance of the cinema as a tool of the state  both for its propaganda value and its ability to keep the populace entertained  can be seen in the filming history of Veit Harlan s Kolberg  1945   the most expensive film of the era  for the shooting of which tens of thousands of soldiers were diverted from their military positions to appear as extras  159  Despite the emigration of many film makers and the political restrictions  the German film industry was not without technical and aesthetic innovations  the introduction of Agfacolor film production being a notable example  Technical and aesthetic achievement could also be turned to the specific ends of the Greater German Reich  most spectacularly in the work of Leni Riefenstahl  Riefenstahl s Triumph of the Will  1935   documenting the Nuremberg Rally  1934   and Olympia  1938   documenting the 1936 Summer Olympics  pioneered techniques of camera movement and editing that have influenced many later films  Both films  particularly Triumph of the Will  remain highly controversial  as their aesthetic merit is inseparable from their propagandizing of Nationalsocialism ideals  159  Irreplacable artists deemed fitting the National socialist ideals such as Marika Rokk and Johannes Heesters where placed on the Gottbegnadeten list by Goebbels during the war  160  Religion Main article  Religion in Nazi Germany The German census of May 1939 indicates that 54 percent of Germans considered themselves Protestant and 40 percent considered themselves Catholic  with only 3 5 percent claiming to be neo pagan  believers in God   and 1 5 percent unbelievers  This census came more than six years into the Nazi era  161  Sports Sports played a central role in the Nazi goal of building strong young athletes to create the  perfect  race and help build Germany into a sports power  The political symbolism of masses of virile near naked bodies occupying public spaces fit easily into the propaganda system  as typified by the 1938 film about the 1936 Berlin Olympics   Olympia   162  Established in 1934  the  Nationalsozialistischer Reichsbund f r Leibes bungen   known by the acronyms NSRL or NSRBL  was the umbrella organization for sports during the Third Reich  Two major displays of Nazi German art and culture were at the 1936 Summer Olympics and at the German pavilion at the 1937 International Exposition in Paris  The 1936 Olympics was meant to display to the world the Aryan superiority of Germany to other nations  German athletes were carefully chosen not only for strength but for Aryan appearance  163  Legacy Starting with the Nuremberg Trials of 1945 46  164  in which top Nazi leaders were tried for war crimes  and executed or given long prison terms   Hitler  Nazism  and  by the 1960s  the Holocaust became symbols of evil in the modern world  165  For the 21st century  Newman and Erber  2002  reported   The Nazis have become one of the most widely recognized images of modern evil  Throughout most of the world today  the concept of evil can readily be evoked by displaying almost any cue reminiscent of Nazism  such as the swastika  the name of any of the principal Nazis  or their garb or affectations      166  There is a high level of historical interest in the popular media as well as in academic world  Evans says it   exerts an almost universal appeal because its murderous racism stands as a warning to the whole of humanity   167  See also Germany portal Collaboration with
