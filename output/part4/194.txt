States located in the western Pacific Ocean  It is one of five U S  territories with an established civilian government  2  3  Guam is listed as one of 16 Non Self Governing Territories by the Special Committee on Decolonization of the United Nations  4  The island s capital is Hag t a  formerly Aga a   Guam is the largest and southernmost of the Mariana Islands  The Chamorros  Guam s indigenous people  first populated the island approximately 4 000 years ago  5  The island has a long history of European colonialism  Discovered by Ferdinand Magellan during a Spanish expedition on March 6  1521  the first colony was established in 1668 by Spain with the arrival of settlers including Padre San Vitores  a Catholic missionary  For more than two centuries Guam was an important stopover for the Spanish Manila Galleons that crossed the Pacific annually  The island was controlled by Spain until 1898  when it was surrendered to the United States during the Spanish American War and later formally ceded as part of the Treaty of Paris  As the largest island in Micronesia and the only U S  held island in the region before World War II  Guam was captured by the Japanese on December 8  1941  hours after the bombing of Pearl Harbor  and was occupied for two and a half years  During the occupation  the people of Guam were subjected to acts that included torture  beheadings and rape  6  and were forced to adopt the Japanese culture  7  Guam was subject to fierce fighting when U S  troops recaptured the island on July 21  1944  a date commemorated every year as Liberation Day  8  Today  Guam s economy is supported by its principal industry  tourism  which is composed primarily of visitors from Japan  Guam s second largest source of income is the United States military  9

from southeastern Indonesia around 2000 BC  Most of what is known about pre contact   Ancient   Chamorros comes from legends and myths  archaeological evidence  Jesuit missionary accounts  and observations from visiting scientists like Otto von Kotzebue and Louis de Freycinet  citation needed  When Europeans first arrived on Guam  Chamorro society had three classes  matua  upper class   achaot  middle class   and mana chang  lower class   The matua were located in the coastal villages  which meant they had the best access to fishing grounds  whereas the mana chang were located in the interior of the island  Matua and mana chang rarely communicated with each other  and matua often used achaot as an intermediary  There were also  mak hna   similar to shamans   skilled in healing and medicine  Belief in spirits of ancient Chamorros called  Taotao mo na  still persists as a remnant of pre European culture  When Magellan arrived on Guam  he was greeted by hundreds of small outrigger canoes that appeared to be flying over the water  due to their considerable speed  These outrigger canoes were called Proas  and resulted in Magellan naming Guam Islas de las Velas Latinas   Islands of the Lateen Sails    Guam  the only Spanish outpost in the Pacific Ocean east of the Philippines  became the regular port between Acapulco  Mexico  and Manila from 1565 to 1815  citation needed  and  since Philippine independence  the most western outpost of actual United States territory in the Pacific  It is the biggest single segment of Micronesia  the largest islands between the islands of Kyushu  Japan   New Guinea  the Philippines  and the Hawaiian Islands  Latte stones are stone pillars that are found only in the Mariana Islands and are a recent development in Pre Contact Chamorro society  The latte stone was used as a foundation on which thatched huts were built  Latte consist of a base shaped from limestone called the haligi and with a capstone  or t sa  made either from a large brain coral or limestone  placed on top  Using carbon dating  archaeologists have broken Pre Contact Guam  i e  Chamorro  history into three periods   Pre Latte   BC 2000  to AD 1   Transitional Pre Latte   AD 1 to AD 1000   and  Latte   AD 1000 to AD 1521   Archaeological evidence also suggests that Chamorro society was on the verge of another transition phase by 1521  as latte stones became bigger  Assuming the larger latte stones were used for chiefly houses  it can be argued that Chamorro society was becoming more stratified  either from population growth or the arrival of new people  citation needed  The theory remains tenuous  however  due to lack of evidence  but if proven correct  would support the idea that Pre Contact Chamorros were in a transitioning society  citation needed   edit  Spanish colonization and the Manila galleons Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan  sailing for the King of Spain  reached the island in 1521 during his fleet s circumnavigation of the globe  General Miguel L pez de Legazpi claimed Guam for Spain in 1565  Spanish colonization commenced in 1668 with the arrival of Padre San Vitores  who established the first Catholic mission  The islands were part of the Spanish East Indies governed from the Philippines  which were in turn part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain based in Mexico City  Between 1668 and 1815  Guam was an important resting stop for the Spanish Manila galleons  a fleet that covered the Pacific trade route between Acapulco  Mexico  and Manila  Philippines   To protect these Pacific fleets  Spain built a number of defensive structures such as Fort Nuestra Se ora de la Soledad in Umatac  which are still standing today  Other reminiscences of colonial times include the old Governor s Palace in Plaza de Espa a and the Spanish Bridge  both in Hagat a  Guam s Cathedral Dulce Nombre de Maria was also built during Spanish times in the 17th century  Guam  along with the rest of the Mariana and Caroline Islands  were treated as part of Spain s colony in the Philippines  While Guam s Chamorro culture has indigenous roots  the cultures of both Guam and the Northern Marianas have many similarities with Spanish and Mexican culture due to three centuries of Spanish rule  9   edit  The Spanish American War and World War II Philippine Spanish peso with commemorative stamp of the occupation of Guam by the U S  in 1899  First assault wave of Marines take cover prior to moving inland during the 1944 Battle of Guam  The United States took control of the island in the 1898 Spanish American War  as part of the Treaty of Paris  Guam came to serve as a station for American ships traveling to and from the Philippines  while the Northern Mariana Islands passed to Germany  and then to Japan  9  During World War II  Guam was attacked and invaded by the armed forces of Japan on December 8  1941  The Northern Mariana Islands had become a Japanese protectorate before the war  It was the Chamorros from the Northern Marianas who were brought to Guam to serve as interpreters and in other capacities for the occupying Japanese force  The Guamanian Chamorros were treated as an occupied enemy by the Japanese military  After the war  this would cause resentment between the Guamanian Chamorros and the Chamorros of the Northern Marianas  Guam s Chamorros believed their northern brethren should have been compassionate towards them  whereas having been occupied for over 30 years  the Northern Mariana Chamorros were loyal to Japan  Guam s Japanese occupation lasted for approximately thirty one months  During this period  the indigenous people of Guam were subjected to forced labor  family separation  incarceration  execution  concentration camps and forced prostitution  Approximately one thousand people died during the occupation  according to Congressional Testimony in 2004  Some historians estimate that war violence killed 10  of Guam s some 20 000 population  10  The United States returned and fought the Battle of Guam on July 21  1944  to recapture the island from Japanese military occupation  More than 18 000 Japanese were killed as only 485 surrendered  Sergeant Shoichi Yokoi  who surrendered in January 1972  appears to have been the last confirmed Japanese holdout in Guam  11  To this day  Guam remains the only U S  soil with a sizable population to have been occupied by a foreign military power  since the War of 1812  The United States also captured and occupied the Northern Marianas   edit  Post war After the war  the Guam Organic Act of 1950  established Guam as an unincorporated organized territory of the United States  provided for the structure of the island s civilian government  and granted the people U S  citizenship  Since Guam is not a U S  state  U S  citizens residing on Guam are not allowed to vote for president and their congressional representative is a non voting member  9   edit  Proposed name change The current flag spells out the island s English name in the Seal of Guam  The name  Guam  is an exonym  In his final State of the Island Address on February 15  2010  Governor Felix Camacho called for Guam to formally be henceforth referred to as Guahan  Gu h n   the name of the island in the indigenous Chamorro language  12  and issued an executive order to make it official  13  14  Camacho simultaneously began referring to himself as the  Governor of Guahan   15  According to historian Toni Ram rez of the Historic Preservation Office of the Guam Department of Parks and Recreation  the name Guahan means  we have  14  or  a place that has   12  in reference to the island s rivers and other natural resources  which were relatively rare on other neighboring Micronesian islands  14  Guahan or Guaj n was the name widely used on the island between 1521 and 1898  12  16  However  both the names Guam and Guahan appear in historic documents and maps dating back hundreds of years  according to Peter Onedera  a historian and Chamorro language professor at the University of Guam  15 Richard Leary  the first United States Naval Governor of the island  adopted the name Guam in 1900 when he called it  isle of Guam   14  15  Two term Governor Camacho  who could not seek a third term  left office in 2011  15  He explained in his final State of the Island Address that the name change will solidify his legacy as governor and cement his place in history  15  He argues that the change to Guahan will reaffirm the island s distinct identity and Chamorro cultural heritage  14  Camacho s order specifically states that the change  enhances the practice of the Chamorro language and promotes the historic and cultural connection to the island   15  The executive order will apply to only local Guamanian government institutions  official communications  business transactions and signs at this time  15  However  Camacho expressed interest in having community leaders  businesses and lawmakers adopt the Guahan name as well  15  He further announced that he would introduce Bill 331 in the Guam Legislature to change the name to Guahan in law  12  The executive order does not have a set deadline for agencies to adopt the change  in order to lessen any time or monetary burdens on the government during a prolonged economic recession  15  Changes should be made when it is most convenient for the government agency  such as ordering new office letterhead  15  Reaction to the proposed change was mixed among both lawmakers and residents  Speaker of the legislature Judith Won Pat noted that the change could help restore a perceived loss of identity in Guam  14  She told the media   This is the age where  throughout the world  people want to know who they are and find their identity  This is very important for Guam as well   14  Author and former senator Katherine Aguon  who recently published a Chamorro English dictionary  also supported the name change  but emphasized that any proposal should be approved by Guamanian voters  15  An official  sanctioned name change may have some economic repercussions on the island  Then senator  and later governor  Eddie Calvo  while supporting the order  noted that the costs of changing the name on signage  documents and advertising campaigns would have to be taken into account  14  The Guam Visitors Bureau  GVB   which has spent millions of dollars to brand Guam as a major tourist and business destination using the island s current name  recently launched a new marketing campaign called  We Are Guam   17  The economic costs of changing all road and welcome signs  as well as documents and tourism campaigns  would have to be evaluated  17   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of Guam Map of Guam An unobstructed view of the island of Guam from NASA s Earth Observing 1 satellite  Guam lies between 13 2 N and 13 7 N and between 144 6 E and 145 0 E  and has an area of 212 square miles  549 km2   making it the 32nd largest island of the United States  It is the southernmost and largest island in the Mariana island chain and is also the largest island in Micronesia  This island chain was created by the colliding Pacific and Philippine Sea tectonic plates  Guam is the closest land mass to the Mariana Trench  a deep subduction zone  that lies beside the island chain to the east  Challenger Deep  the deepest surveyed point in the Oceans  is southwest of Guam at 35 797 feet  10 911 m  deep  The highest point in Guam is Mount Lamlam  which is 1 332 feet  406 m   The island of Guam is 30 miles  48 km  long and 4 miles  6 km  to 12 miles  19 km  wide  The island experiences occasional earthquakes due to its location on the western edge of the Pacific Plate and near the Philippine Sea Plate  In recent years  earthquakes with epicenters near Guam have had magnitudes ranging from 5 0 to 8 7  Unlike the Anatahan volcano in the Northern Mariana Islands  Guam is not volcanically active  18  However  due to its proximity to Anatahan  vog does occasionally affect Guam  19  A coral table reef with deepwater channels surrounds most of Guam  Sandy beaches  rock cliff lines and mangroves characterize the coastline area  Sheer limestone coastal cliffs dominate the north  while the southern end of the island is mountainous  with lower hills in between  20   edit  Climate The climate is characterized as tropical marine  The weather is generally hot and very humid with little seasonal temperature variation  The mean high temperature is 86  F  30  C  and mean low is 76  F  24  C  with an average annual rainfall of 96 inches  2 180 mm   The dry season runs from December through June  The remaining months  July through November  constitute the rainy season  The months of January and February are considered the coolest months of the year with night time temperatures in the mid to low 70s and generally lower humidity levels  The highest risk of typhoons is during October and November  They can  however  occur year round  Guam is located in what has been nicknamed  Typhoon Alley  and it is common for the island to be threatened by tropical storms and possible typhoons during the wet season  The most intense typhoon to pass over Guam recently was Super Typhoon Pongsona  with sustained winds of 144 miles per hour  gusts to 173 miles per hour  which slammed Guam on December 8  2002  leaving massive destruction  Since Super Typhoon Pamela in 1976  wooden structures have been largely replaced by concrete structures  21  22  During the 1980s wooden utility poles began to be replaced by typhoon resistant concrete and steel poles  After the local Government enforced stricter construction codes  many home and business owners built their structures out of reinforced concrete with installed typhoon shutters   edit  Demographics Main article  Demographics of Guam See also  List of U S  states and territories by population Historical populations Census Pop     1910 11 806   1920 13 275 12

conducted in 2000  the population of Guam was 154 805  23  The 2008 population estimate for Guam is 175 000  20  As of 2005  the annual population growth is 1 76   24  The largest ethnic group are the native Chamorros  accounting for 37 1  of the total population  Other significant ethnic groups include those of Filipino  25 5    White  10    European  often of Spanish and European American ancestry  The rest are of Chinese  Japanese and Korean ancestry  Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion  with 85  of the population claiming an affiliation with it  The programmed U S  military buildup  2010 14  will cause an unprecedented population increase  approximately 40  or nearly 80 000 people at the peak of constructions 25   which will significantly impact Guam s very limited and aging infrastructure  This expected population increase would otherwise occur over a 20 year period  The official languages of the island are English and Chamorro   edit  Culture This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  See also  Music of Guam Dulce Nombre de Maria Cathedral Basilica in Hag t a  faced by a statue of Pope John Paul II  Roman Catholicism is the main religion in Guam  Traditional Chamorro culture is a combination of indigenous pre Hispanic customs and Spanish or Mexican traditions  It is manifested in Chamorro language  music  dance  sea navigation  unique cuisine  fishing  games  such as batu  chonka  estuleks  and bayogu   songs and fashion  During Spanish colonial rule  1668 1898  the majority of the population was converted to Roman Catholicism and religious festivities such as Easter and Christmas became widespread  Traditional Chamorro cuisine is largely based on corn  and includes tortillas  tamales  atole and chilaquiles  which are a clear influence from Mexico  The Chamorro language is a Malayo Polynesian language with much Spanish influence  Many Chamorros also have Spanish surnames because of their conversion to Roman Catholic Christianity and the adoption of names from the Cat logo alfab tico de apellidos  a phenomenon common to the Philippines  Due to foreign cultural influence from Spain and the United States  important aspects of the early indigenous culture have been lost over the years  though there has been a resurgence in preserving this pre Hispanic culture in the last few decades  Some scholars have traveled throughout the Pacific Islands conducting research to study what the original Chamorro cultural practices such as dance  language  and canoe building may have been like  Two aspects of indigenous pre Hispanic culture that withstood time are chenchule  and inafa maolek  Chenchule  is the intricate system of reciprocity at the heart of Chamorro society  It is rooted in the core value of inafa maolek  Historian Lawrence Cunningham in 1992 wrote   In a Chamorro sense  the land and its produce belong to everyone  Inafa maolek  or interdependence  is the key  or central value  in Chamorro culture     Inafa maolek depends on a spirit of cooperation and sharing  This is the armature  or core  that everything in Chamorro culture revolves around  It is a powerful concern for mutuality rather than individualism and private property rights   Chief Gadao is featured in many legends about Guam before European colonization  The core culture or Pengngan Chamorro is based on complex social protocol centered upon respect  From sniffing over the hands of the elders  called mangnginge in Chamorro   the passing down of legends  chants  and courtship rituals  to a person asking for permission from spiritual ancestors before entering a jungle or ancient battle grounds  Other practices predating Spanish conquest include galaide  canoe making  making of the belembaotuyan  a string musical instrument made from a gourd   fashioning of  cho  atupat slings and slingstones  tool manufacture  M tan Guma  burial rituals  and preparation of herbal medicines by Suruhanu  Master craftsmen and women specialize in weavings  including plaited work  niyok  and  kgak leaf baskets  mats  bags  hats  and food containments   loom woven material  kalachucha hibiscus and banana fiber skirts  belts and burial shrouds   and body ornamentation  bead and shell necklaces  bracelets  earrings  belts and combs made from tortoise shells  and Spondylus  The cosmopolitan nature of modern Guam poses challenges for Chamorros struggling to preserve their culture and identity amidst forces of acculturation  The increasing numbers of Chamorros  especially Chamorro youth  relocating to the U S  Mainland has further complicated both definition and preservation of Chamorro identity  citation needed  While only a few masters exist to continue traditional art forms  the resurgence of interest among the Chamorros to preserve the language and culture has resulted in a growing number of young Chamorros who seek to continue the ancient ways of the Chamorro people   edit  Government

has no real effect  However  in sending delegates to the Republican and Democratic national conventions  Guam does have influence in the national presidential race  These delegates are elected by local party conventions  9  In the 1980s and early 1990s  there was a significant movement in favor of the territory becoming a commonwealth  which would give it a level of self government similar to Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands  However  the federal government rejected the version of a commonwealth that the government of Guam proposed  due to it having clauses incompatible with the Territorial Clause  Art  IV  Sec  3  cl  2  of the U S  Constitution  Other movements are also in existence that advocate becoming a U S  state  union with the state of Hawaii  union with the

has proposed to build a new aircraft carrier berth on Guam and to move 8 600 Marines  and 9 000 of their dependents  to Guam from Okinawa  Japan  Including the required construction workers  this buildup would increase Guam s population by 45   In a February 2010 letter  the United States Environmental Protection Agency sharply criticized these plans because of a water shortfall  sewage problems and the impact on coral reefs  27  With the proposed increased military presence stemming from the upcoming preparation efforts and relocation efforts of U S  Marines from Okinawa  Japan to Guam slated to begin in 2010 and last for the next several years thereafter  the amounts of total land that the military will control or tenant may grow to or surpass 40  of the entire landmass of Guam  In January  2011  the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for FY2011 indicated that recent significant events will delay the deadline for realigning U S  Marine Corps service members and their families from Okinawa to Guam  The transfer may be as late as 2020  In addition  the Defense Authorization Act cut approximately  320 million from the 2011 budget request  Villagers and the

tourists  Its tourist hub  Tumon  features over 20 large hotels  a Duty Free Shoppers Galleria  Pleasure Island district  indoor aquarium  Sandcastle Las Vegas styled shows and other shopping and entertainment venues  It is a relatively short flight from Asia or Australia compared to Hawaii  with hotels and seven public golf courses accommodating over a million tourists per year  Although 75 percent of the tourists are Japanese  Guam receives a sizable number of tourists from South Korea  the U S   the Philippines  and Taiwan  28  Significant sources of revenue include duty free designer

attracted to Guam due to its proximity  environmental  and cultural familiarity  Over the years  it was claimed by some in Guam that the territory has had to bear the brunt of this agreement in the form of public assistance programs and public education for those from the regions involved  and the federal government should compensate the states and territories affected by this type of migration

between Guam and the states varies depending on size and time of year  Light  first class items generally take less than a week to or from the mainland  but larger first class or Priority items can take a week or two  Fourth class mail  such as magazines  are transported by sea after reaching Hawaii  Most residents use post office boxes or private mail boxes  although residential delivery is becoming increasingly available  Incoming mail not from the Americas should be addressed to  Guam  instead of  USA  to avoid being routed the long way through the U S  mainland and possibly charged a higher rate  especially from Asia   The Commercial Port of Guam is the island s lifeline because most products must be shipped into Guam for consumers  The port is also the regional transhipment hub

proceed directly to Guam Customs and Quarantine  However  due to the Guam and CNMI visa waiver program for certain countries  an eligibility pre clearance check is carried on Guam for flights to the

 no immigration check is performed  Traveling between Guam and the States through a foreign point  however  does require a passport  Most residents travel within Guam using personally owned vehicles  The local government currently outsources the only public bus system  Guam Regional Transit Authority   and some commercial companies operate buses between tourist frequented locations   edit  Ecological issues Guam exemplifies the effects of bioinvasion   edit  Brown tree snake Brown Tree Snake Believed to be a stowaway on a U S  military transport near the end of World War II  the brown tree snake  Boiga irregularis  came to Guam and nearly eliminated the native bird population of an island that previously had no native species of snake  this snake has no natural predators on the island  While slightly venomous  the brown tree snake is relatively harmless to human beings  Although some studies have suggested a high density of brown tree snakes on Guam  residents rarely see these nocturnal snakes  The United States Department of Agriculture has trained detector dogs to keep brown tree snakes out of the island s cargo flow  and the United States Geological Survey has dogs capable of detecting snakes in forested environments around the region s islands  34  35  The consequence of the introduction of the brown tree snake has been significant over the past several decades  The reduction of local bird populations has been attributed to the introduction and presence of brown tree snakes  who eat them  According to many elders  koko birds were common in Guam prior to World War II  they are no longer around largely due to predation by brown tree snakes  36   edit  Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle An infestation of the coconut rhinoceros beetle  CRB   Oryctes rhinoceros  was detected on Guam on September 12  2007  CRB is not known to occur in the United States except in American Samoa  Delimiting surveys performed September 13 25  2007 indicated that the infestation was limited to Tumon Bay and Faifai Beach  an area of approximately 900 acres  3 6 km2   Guam Department of Agriculture  GDA  placed quarantine on all properties within the Tumon area on October 5 and later expanded the quarantine to about 2 500 acres  10 km2  on October 25  approximately 0 5 miles  800 m  radius in all directions from all known locations of CRB infestation  CRB is native to Southern Asia and distributed throughout Asia and the Western Pacific including Sri Lanka  Upolu  Western Samoa  American Samoa  Palau Islands  New Britain  West Irian  New Ireland  Pak Island and Manus Island  New Guinea   Fiji  Cocos  Keeling  Islands  Mauritius  and Reunion  Adults are the injurious stage of the insect  They are generally night time fliers and when they alight on a host  they chew down into the folded  emerging fronds of coconut palms to feed on sap  V shaped cuts in the fronds and holes through the midrib are visible when the leaves grow out and unfold  If the growing tip is injured  the palm may be killed or severe loss of leaf tissue may cause decreased nut set  Feeding wounds may also serve as an infection pathway for pathogens or other pests  The effects of adult boring may be more severe on younger palms where spears are narrower  Mortality of young palms has already been observed on Guam  Oviposition and larval development typically occurs in decaying coconut logs or stumps  Control measures have been developed for CRB and the current strategy on Guam is to implement an integrated eradication program using pheromone baited  attractive traps to capture adults  various methods to eliminate infested and susceptible host material  and pesticides to kill larvae and adults  Pesticides may also be applied to uninfested trees as a preventive treatment  USDA APHIS has completed an Environmental Assessment for the coconut rhinoceros beetle eradication program on Guam  EA Number  GU 08 1  http   www guaminsects net uogces kbwiki images d dc CRB EA pdf   The eradication program is a cooperative effort between USDA  APHIS and Forest Service   GDA and the University of Guam  UOG   This document follows the Forest Service Pest Risk Assessment  Kliejunas et al  2001  format and is intended to provide information regarding the current status of CRB on Guam  its potential to spread to uninfested locales  and the consequences of establishment  The high  moderate or low riskvalues are based on available biological information and the subjective judgment of the authors  In 2010  GDA and UOG set out to introduce a virus in the adult population designed to kill the beetle through infection by beetles released from the labs  In June 2010  during a controlled release of infected adult beetles and in a joint venture with a team from New Zealand  they discovered     unusual rhino beetle behavior  the beetles were not breeding on the ground in decayed logs as normal  they were breeding in the detritus trapped in the tree branches  In cutting down 11 large coconut palms they found a complete ecosystem in the crowns including brown tree snakes  crabs  and  unfortunately  all life stages of rhinoceros beetles  from eggs to larva to young adults  This new discovery makes the release of the bio control virus even more vital  Moore thinks this arboreal breeding behavior  seen only on Guam  may be because the brown tree snake has wiped out most of Guam s rats  Elsewhere  rats love to live in coconut crowns  and they love to eat rhino beetle grubs  This never before seen rhino beetle behavior of breeding in the crowns of coconut trees underscores an important point of invasive species on small islands  Their impact is often severe because there are no natural enemies  such as predators  parasites  or diseases  to control their population growth   37  A joint initiative between Guam Customs  amp  Quarantine  which trains CRB detector dogs and CRB handlers   Guam Department of Agriculture  which employs CRB detector dog handlers   University of Guam College of Agriculture  which provides CRB Detector Dog program funding  and the U S  Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Station  the federal agency providing strategic direction and regulatory guidance  to form the nation s first Bio Security Task Force which features the nation s first CRB trained detector dogs  This program will provide enhanced capability and capacity for the invasive species interdiction and eradication program in order to mitigate these species on Guam and prevent it from spreading to other jurisdictions in the United States  This Task Force increases the island s capacity to handle the increased volume of invasive species associated with the unprecedented military buildup on Guam   edit  Other invasive animal species A Cane toad From the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries  the Spanish introduced pigs  dogs  chickens  the Philippine deer  Cervus mariannus   black francolins  and water buffalo  Water buffalo  known as carabao locally  have cultural significance  Herds of these animals obstruct military base operations and harm native ecosystems  After birth control and adoption efforts were ineffective  the U S  military began culling the herds in 2002 leading to organized protests from island residents  38  Other introduced species include cane toads imported in 1937  the giant African snail  an agricultural pest introduced during WWII by Japanese occupation troops  and more recently frog species which could threaten crops in addition to providing additional food for the brown tree snake population  Reports of loud chirping frogs native to Puerto Rico and known as coqu   that may have arrived from Hawaii  have led to fears that the noise could threaten Guam s tourism  39  Introduced feral pigs and deer  over hunting  and habitat loss from human development are also major factors in the decline and loss of Guam s native plants and animals   edit  Threats to indigenous plants Invading animal species are not the only threat to Guam s native flora  Tinangaja  a virus affecting coconut palms  was first observed on the island in 1917 when copra production was still a major part of Guam s economy  Though coconut plantations no longer exist on the island  the dead and infected trees that have resulted from the epidemic are seen throughout the forests of Guam  40  Also during the past century  the dense forests of northern Guam have been largely replaced by thick tangan tangan brush  Leucaena native to the Americas   Much of Guam s foliage was lost during World War II  In 1947  the U S  military is thought to have planted tangan tangan by seeding the island from the air to prevent erosion  Tangan tangan was present on the island before 1905  Stone Useful Plants of Guam  1905   In southern Guam  non native grass species also dominate much of the landscape   edit  Wildfires Guam s grassland Wildfires plague the forested   boonie  or  jungle   areas of Guam every dry season despite the island s humid climate  Most fires are man caused with 80 percent resulting from arson  41 Poachers often start fires to attract deer to the new growth  Invasive grass species that rely on fire as part of their natural life cycle grow in many regularly burned areas  Grasslands and  barrens  have replaced previously forested areas leading to greater soil erosion  During the rainy season sediment is carried by the heavy rains into the Fena Lake Reservoir and Ugum River  leading to water quality problems for southern Guam  Eroded silt also destroys the marine life in reefs around the island  Soil stabilization efforts by volunteers and forestry workers to plant trees have had little success in preserving natural habitats  42   edit  Aquatic preserves Tumon Bay  Currently a marine wildlife preserve after having gone through extensive dredging practices  As a vacation spot for scuba divers  efforts have been made to protect Guam s coral reef habitats from pollution  eroded silt  and overfishing that have led to decreased fish populations  In recent years the Department of Agriculture  Division of Aquatic and Wildlife Resources has established several new marine preserves where fish populations are monitored by biologists  43  Prior to adopting U S  Environmental Protection Agency  standards  portions of Tumon Bay were dredged by the hotel chains in order to provide a better experience for hotel guests  44  45  Tumon Bay has since been made into a preserve  A federal Guam National Wildlife Refuge in northern Guam protects the decimated sea turtle population in addition to a small colony of Mariana fruit bats  46  Harvest of sea turtle eggs was a common occurrence on Guam prior to World War II  The Green sea turtle  Chelonia mydas  was harvested legally on Guam prior to August 1978  when it was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act  The Hawksbill sea turtle  Eretmochelys imbricata  has been on the endangered list since 1970  In an effort to ensure protection of sea turtles on Guam  routine sightings are counted during aerial surveys and nest sites are recorded and monitored for hatchlings  Traditional harvests of sea turtles were primarily for local consumption at fiestas  weddings  funerals  and christenings  In recent times  poaching of sea turtles has been known to occur on Guam due to the traditional demand for its meat  Capture of the responsible parties has been difficult  although arrests have been made for unauthorized take  Effective conservation and enforcement will be critical to the recovery efforts of this project  DAWR will continue to give sea turtle presentations for community awareness  especially through the elementary secondary school system and University of Guam  In addition  the recommendation to produce and distribute sea turtle posters and pamphlets would help to enhance conservation and recovery awareness within the local community  Guam s Division of Aquatic and Wildlife Resources  DAWR  Sea Turtle Recovery Program  STRP  is funded in part by the NMFS Honolulu  PIAO to determine the extent of Guam s resident nesting sea turtle populations and nesting habitats by conducting beach surveys and satellite tracking  ComNavMarianas has funded part of the satellite telemetry portion of the project through the purchase of satellite tags and satellite time  The objectives of the project are  To collect baseline population size structure  age and size  and genetic information for sea turtles in and about Guam  To survey Guam s beaches for sea turtle nesting activity for both green turtle  Chelonia mydas  and hawksbill  Eretmochelys imbricata  throughout the nesting period in order to determine the size of the nesting population of sea turtles on Guam and to employ a variety of tagging techniques to determine movement  residency and further define population dynamics  To establish a Guam based sea turtle working group consisting of natural resource stakeholders and involve them in the refinement of the implementation plan  The acquisition of satellite tagging materials and training was completed in March and April 2000  On June 28  2000  an approximately 250 300 pound Green sea turtle  Chelonia mydas  was Argos satellite tagged and tracked after making a false crawl  i e   one in which no nest was made  on Explosive Ordnance Disposal Beach  Andersen Air Force Base  A poaching arrest was also made on the following morning concerning a 22 lb  C  mydas that was illegally speared in the Tumon Bay Marine Preserve Area  Whitespotted boxfish  Ostracion meleagris  Royal angelfish  Pygoplites diacanthus  Reef fish of Guam  edit  Education  edit  Colleges
