southeastern United States  The state borders South Carolina and Georgia to the south  Tennessee to the west and Virginia to the north  North Carolina is the 28th most extensive and the 10th most populous of the 50 United States  North Carolina comprises 100 counties  6  Its capital is Raleigh  and its largest city is Charlotte  In the past five decades  North Carolina s economy has undergone a transition from heavy reliance upon tobacco and furniture making to a more diversified economy with engineering  biotechnology  and finance sectors  7  8  North Carolina has a wide range of elevations  from sea level on the coast to 6 684 feet  2 037 m  at Mt  Mitchell  the highest point in the Eastern US  9  The climate of the coastal plains is strongly influenced by the Atlantic Ocean  Most of the state falls in the humid subtropical climate zone  More than 300 miles  500 km  from the coast  the western  mountainous part of the state has a subtropical highland climate  Contents 1

Tennessee on the west  Virginia on the north  and the Atlantic Ocean on the east  The United States Census Bureau classifies North Carolina as a southern state in the subcategory of being one of the South Atlantic States  North Carolina consists of three main geographic sections  the coastal plain  which occupies the eastern 45  of the state  the Piedmont region  which contains the middle 35   and the Appalachian Mountains and foothills  The extreme eastern section of the state contains the Outer Banks  a string of sandy  narrow islands which form a barrier between the Atlantic Ocean and two inland waterways or  sounds   Albemarle Sound in the north and Pamlico Sound in the south  They are the two largest landlocked sounds in the United States  So many ships have been lost off Cape Hatteras that the area is known as the  Graveyard of the Atlantic   More than 1 000 ships have sunk in these waters since records began in 1526  Cullasaja Falls in Macon County Immediately inland  the coastal plain is relatively flat  with rich soil ideal for growing tobacco  soybeans  melons  and cotton  The coastal plain is North Carolina s most rural section  with few large towns or cities  Agriculture remains an important industry  The coastal plain transitions to the Piedmont region along the  fall line   a line which marks the elevation at which waterfalls first appear on streams and rivers  The Piedmont region of central North Carolina is the state s most urbanized and densely populated section  It consists of gently rolling countryside frequently broken by hills or low mountain ridges  Small  isolated  and deeply eroded mountain ranges and peaks are located in the Piedmont  including the Sauratown Mountains  Pilot Mountain  the Uwharrie Mountains  Crowder s Mountain  King s Pinnacle  the Brushy Mountains  and the South Mountains  The Piedmont ranges from about 300 400 feet  90 120 m  elevation in the east to over 1 000 feet  300 m  in the west  Due to the rapid population growth in the Piedmont  a significant part of the rural area in this region is being transformed into suburbs with shopping centers  housing  and corporate offices  Agriculture is steadily declining in its importance  The major rivers of the Piedmont  such as the Yadkin and Catawba  tend to be fast flowing  shallow  and narrow  Snow in Old Fort  North Carolina caused by the 2009 Blizzard The western section of the state is part of the Appalachian Mountain range  Among the subranges of the Appalachians located in the state are the Great Smoky Mountains  Blue Ridge Mountains  Great Balsam Mountains  and the Black Mountains  The Black Mountains are the highest in the Eastern United States  and culminate in Mount Mitchell at 6 684 feet  2 037 m   10  It is the highest point east of the Mississippi River  Although agriculture still remains important  tourism has become a dominant industry in the mountains  Growing Christmas trees has recently been an important industry  Due to the higher altitude  the climate in the mountains often differs markedly from the rest of the state  Winter in western North Carolina typically features high snowfall and subfreezing temperatures more akin to those of a midwestern state than of a southern state  North Carolina has 17 major river basins  The basins west of the Blue Ridge Mountains flow to the Gulf of Mexico  via the Ohio and then the Mississippi River   All the others flow to the Atlantic Ocean  Of the 17 basins  11 originate within the state of North Carolina  but only four are contained entirely within the state s border   the Cape Fear  Neuse  White Oak and Tar Pamlico  11   edit  Climate Main article  Climate of North Carolina Bodie Island Lighthouse  one of the Outer Banks attractions  The geographical divisions of North Carolina are useful when discussing the climate of the state  The climate of the coastal plain is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean  which keeps temperatures mild in winter and moderate in summer  The highest temperature in the daytime average less than 89  F  31 6  C  on the coast in the summer  The coast has mild temperature in winter  with daytime temperature rarely dropping below 40  F  4 4  C   The average daytime temperature in the coastal plain is usually in the mid 60 s in winter  Temperature in the coastal plain rarely drops below the freezing point at night  The coastal plain usually receives only one inch  2 5 cm  of snow or ice annually  and in some years  there may be no snow or ice at all  Deer in the Eno River as it flows through the Piedmont region of North Carolina  The Atlantic Ocean has less influence on the climate of the Piedmont region  which has hotter summers and colder winters than in the coast  Daytime highs in the Piedmont often average over 90  F  32 2  C  in the summer  While it is not common for the temperature to reach over 100  F  37 8  C  in the state  such temperature  if it occurs  is found in the lower areas of the Piedmont  The weaker influence of the Atlantic Ocean also means that temperatures in the Piedmont often fluctuate more widely than in the coast  In winter  the Piedmont is colder than the coast  with temperatures usually averaging in the 40s during the day and often dropping below the freezing point at night  The region averages from 3 5 inches of snowfall annually in the Charlotte area  to 6 8 inches in the Raleigh Durham area  The Piedmont is especially notorious for sleet and freezing rain  Freezing rain can be heavy enough to slow town traffic and break down trees and power lines  Annual precipitation and humidity are lower in the Piedmont than in the mountains or the coast  but even at its lowest  the precipitation is 40 in  102 cm  per year  The Blue Ridge Mountains as seen from the Blue Ridge Parkway  The Appalachian Mountains are the coolest area of the state  with daytime temperatures averaging in the low 40s and upper 30s for highs in the winter and often falling into the teens   9  C  or lower on winter nights  Relatively cool summers have temperatures rarely rising above 80  F  26 7  C   Snowfall in the mountains is usually 14 30 in  36 51 cm  per year  but it is often greater in the higher elevations  For example  during the Blizzard of 1993 more than 60 inches  150 cm  of snow fell on Mount Mitchell over a period of three days  Additionally  Mount Mitchell has received snow in every month of the year  Severe weather occurs regularly in North Carolina  On average  a hurricane hits the state once a decade  Destructive hurricanes that have struck the state include Hurricane Hazel  Hurricane Fran  and Hurricane Floyd  Hurricane Isabel stands out as the most damaging of the 21st century  12  Tropical storms arrive every 3 or 4 years  In addition  many hurricanes and tropical storms graze the state  In some years  several hurricanes or tropical storms can directly strike the state or brush across the coastal areas  Only Florida and Louisiana are hit by hurricanes more often  Although many people believe that hurricanes menace only coastal areas  the rare hurricane which moves inland quickly enough can cause severe damage  In 1989 Hurricane Hugo caused heavy damage in Charlotte and even as far inland as the Blue Ridge Mountains in the northwestern part of the state  On average  North Carolina has 50 days of thunderstorm activity per year  with some storms becoming severe enough to produce hail  flash floods  and damaging winds  North Carolina averages fewer than 20 tornadoes per year  Many of these are produced by hurricanes or tropical storms along the coastal plain  Tornadoes from thunderstorms are a risk  especially in the eastern part of the state  The western Piedmont is often protected by the mountains breaking storms up as they try to cross over them  The storms will often reform farther east  Also a weather feature known as  cold air damming  occurs in the western part of the state  This can also weaken storms but can also lead to major ice events in winter   13  In April 2011  one of the worst tornado outbreaks in North Carolina s history occurred  25 confirmed tornadoes touched down  mainly in the Eastern Piedmont  killing at least 24 people  Damages in the capital of Raleigh alone were over  115 million  14  15  Monthly normal high and low temperatures  Fahrenheit  for various North

Expedition built Fort San Juan in 1567  This was sited at Joara  a Mississippian culture regional chiefdom near present day Morganton in the western interior  It lasted only 18 months as the natives killed all but one of the 120 men Pardo had stationed at a total of six forts in the area  17  North Carolina became one of the English Thirteen Colonies  and was originally known as Province of Carolina  along with South Carolina  The northern and southern parts of the original Province separated in 1729  Originally settled by small farmers  sometimes having a few slaves  who were oriented toward subsistence agriculture  the colony lacked cities or even towns  Pirates menaced the seacoast settlements  but by 1718 the pirates had been captured and executed  Growth was strong in the middle of the 18th century  as the economy attracted Scotch Irish  Quaker  English and German immigrants  The colonists supported the American Revolution  as the Loyalists were weak  North Carolina made the smallest per capita contribution to the war of any state  as only 7800 men joined the Continental Army under General George Washington  an additional 10 000 served in local militia units under such leaders as General Nathanael Greene  18  There was some military action  especially in 1780 81  Many Carolinian frontiersmen had moved west over the mountains into the Washington District  later known as Tennessee   but in 1789 the state relinquished its claim to the western lands  ceding them to the national government  After 1800  cotton and tobacco became important export crops  and the eastern half of the state developed a plantation system based on slavery  while the western areas were dominated by white families who operated small farms  In the early national period  the state became a center of Jeffersonian Democracy and Jacksonian Democracy with a strong Whig presence  especially in the West  On May 20  1861  North Carolina was the last of the Confederate states to declare secession from the Union  13 days after the Tennessee legislature voted for secession  Some 125 000 North Carolinians saw military service  20 000 were killed in battle and 21 000 died of disease  The state government was reluctant to support the demands of the national government in Richmond  and the state was the scene of only small battles  With the end of the war in 1865  the Reconstruction Era began  slavery was abolished without any compensation to the slave holders  or reparations to the freedmen  A coalition of black Freedmen  northern Carpetbaggers  and local Scalawags controlled state government for three years but the white conservatives were back in control by 1871  The system of Jim Crow and legal segregation made the blacks into second class citizens from the 1880s until 1964  Angry memories of Reconstruction helped make the Democratic Party dominant in state and national elections  By the 1960s  changing party politics  and the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  significantly reversed the role of Democrat and Republican parties in the South  North Carolina was impoverished by the Civil War  and became increasingly locked into a cotton economy  Towns and cities remained few in the east  but a major industrial base emerged in the late 19th century in the western counties based on cotton mills  The state was the site of the first successful controlled  powered and sustained heavier than air flight  by the Wright brothers  near Kitty Hawk on December 17  1903  North Carolina was hard hit by the Great Depression  but the New Deal s farm programs for cotton and tobacco significantly helped the farmers  After World War II  the state s economy grew rapidly  highlighted by the growth of such cities as Charlotte  Raleigh  and Durham  In the 1990s  Charlotte became a major regional and national banking center   edit  Native Americans  lost colonies  and permanent settlement See also  Native Americans in the United States  Joara  and Roanoke Island Map of the coast of Virginia and North Carolina  drawn 1585 1586 by Theodor de Bry  based on map by John White of the Roanoke Colony North Carolina was originally inhabited by many different prehistoric native cultures  Before 200 AD  they were building earthwork mounds  which were used for ceremonial and religious purposes  Succeeding peoples  including those of the ancient Mississippian culture established by 1000 AD in the Piedmont  continued to build or add on to such mounds  In the 500 700 years preceding European contact  the Mississippian culture built large  complex cities and maintained far flung regional trading networks  Historically documented tribes in the North Carolina region included the Carolina Algonquian speaking tribes of the coastal areas  such as the Chowanoke  Roanoke  Pamlico  Machapunga  Coree  Cape Fear Indians  and others  who were the first encountered by the English  Iroquoian speaking Meherrin  Cherokee and Tuscarora of the interior  and Southeastern Siouan tribes  such as the Cheraw  Waxhaw  Saponi  Waccamaw  and Catawba  Spanish explorers traveling inland in the 16th century met the Mississippian culture people at Joara  a regional chiefdom near present day Morganton  Records of Hernando de Soto attested to his meeting with them in 1540  In 1567 Captain Juan Pardo led an expedition into the interior to claim the area for the Spanish colony  as well as establish another route to protect silver mines in Mexico  Pardo made a winter base at Joara  which he renamed Cuenca  The expedition built Fort San Juan and left 30 men  while Pardo traveled further  and built and staffed five other forts  He returned by a different route to Santa Elena on Parris Island  South Carolina  then a center of Spanish Florida  In the spring of 1568  natives killed all but one of the soldiers and burned the six forts in the interior  including the one at Fort San Juan  Although the Spanish never returned to the interior  this marked the first European attempt at colonization of the interior of what became the United States  A 16th century journal by Pardo s scribe Bandera and archaeological findings since 1986 at Joara have confirmed the settlement  19  20  John White returns to find the colony abandoned In 1584  Elizabeth I  granted a charter to Sir Walter Raleigh  for whom the state capital is named  for land in present day North Carolina  then Virginia   21  Raleigh established two colonies on the coast in the late 1580s  both ending in failure  It was the second American territory the English attempted to colonize  The demise of one  the  Lost Colony  of Roanoke Island  remains one of the mysteries of American history  Virginia Dare  the first English child to be born in North America  was born on Roanoke Island on August 18  1587  Dare County is named for her  As early as 1650  colonists from the Virginia colony moved into the area of Albemarle Sound  By 1663  King Charles II of England granted a charter to start a new colony on the North American continent which generally established its borders  He named it Carolina in honor of his father Charles I  22  By 1665  a second charter was issued to attempt to resolve territorial questions  In 1710  due to disputes over governance  the Carolina colony began to split into North Carolina and South Carolina  The latter became a crown colony in 1729  A devastating series of smallpox epidemics swept the South  23  According to Russell Thornton   The 1738 epidemic was said to have killed one half of the Cherokee  with other tribes of the area suffering equally   24   edit  Colonial period and Revolutionary War See also  Province of Carolina  Province of North Carolina  and American Revolutionary War Reconstructed royal governor s mansion Tryon Palace in New Bern The first permanent European settlers of North Carolina after the Spanish in the 16th century were English colonists who migrated south from Virginia  following a rapid growth of the colony and the subsequent shortage of available farmland  Nathaniel Batts was documented as one of the first of these Virginian migrants  He settled south of the Chowan River and east of the Great Dismal Swamp in 1655  25  By 1663  this northeastern area of the Province of Carolina  known as the Albemarle Settlements  was undergoing full scale English settlement  26  During the same period  the English monarch Charles II gave the province to the Lords Proprietors  a group of noblemen who had helped restore Charles to the throne in 1660  The new province of  Carolina  was named in honor and memory of King Charles I  Latin  Carolus   In 1712  North Carolina became a separate colony  Except for the Earl Granville holdings  it became a royal colony seventeen years later  27  Differences in the settlement patterns of eastern and western North Carolina  or the low country and uplands  affected the political  economic  and social life of the state from the eighteenth until the 20th century  The Tidewater in eastern North Carolina was settled chiefly by immigrants from rural England and the Scottish Highlands  The upcountry of western North Carolina was settled chiefly by Scots Irish  English and German Protestants  the so called  cohee   Arriving during the mid to late 18th century  the Scots Irish from what is today Northern Ireland were the largest non English immigrant group before the Revolution and English indentured servants were overwhelmingly the largest immigrant group prior to the Revolution  28  29  30  29  30  31  During the American Revolutionary War  the English and Highland Scots of eastern North Carolina tended to remain loyal to the British Crown  because of longstanding business and personal connections with Great Britain  The English  Welsh  Scots Irish and German settlers of western North Carolina tended to favor American independence from Britain  Most of the English colonists arrived as indentured servants  hiring themselves out as laborers for a fixed period to pay for their passage  In the early years the line between indentured servants and African slaves or laborers was fluid  Some Africans were allowed to earn their freedom before slavery became a lifelong status  Most of the free colored families formed in North Carolina before the Revolution were descended from unions or marriages between free white women and enslaved or free African or African American men  Because the mothers were free  their children were born free  Many had migrated or were descendants of migrants from colonial Virginia  32  As the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in Great Britain  more slaves were imported and the state s restrictions on slavery hardened  The economy s growth and prosperity was based on slave labor  devoted first to the production of tobacco  On April 12  1776  the colony became the first to instruct its delegates to the Continental Congress to vote for independence from the British crown  through the Halifax Resolves passed by the North Carolina Provincial Congress  The dates of both of these events are memorialized on the state flag and state seal  33  Throughout the Revolutionary War  fierce guerrilla warfare erupted between bands of pro independence and pro British colonists  In some cases the war was also an excuse to settle private grudges and rivalries  A major American victory in the war took place at King s Mountain along the North Carolina South Carolina border  On October 7  1780 a force of 1000 mountain men from western North Carolina  including what is today the State of Tennessee  overwhelmed a force of some 1000 British troops led by Major Patrick Ferguson  Most of the British soldiers in this battle were Carolinians who had remained loyal to the British Crown  they were called  Tories    The American victory at Kings Mountain gave the advantage to colonists who favored American independence  and it prevented the British Army from recruiting new soldiers from the Tories  1st Maryland Regiment holding the line at the Battle of Guilford  The road to Yorktown and America s independence from Great Britain led through North Carolina  As the British Army moved north from victories in Charleston and Camden  South Carolina  the Southern Division of the Continental Army and local militia prepared to meet them  Following General Daniel Morgan s victory over the British Cavalry Commander Banastre Tarleton at the Battle of Cowpens on January 17  1781  southern commander Nathanael Greene led British Lord Charles Cornwallis across the heartland of North Carolina  and away from Cornwallis s base of supply in Charleston  South Carolina  This campaign is known as  The Race to the Dan  or  The Race for the River   27  Generals Greene and Cornwallis finally met at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse in present day Greensboro on March 15  1781  Although the British troops held the field at the end of the battle  their casualties at the hands of the numerically superior American Army were crippling  Following this  Pyrrhic victory   Cornwallis chose to move to the Virginia coastline to get reinforcements  and to allow the Royal Navy to protect his battered army  This decision would result in Cornwallis s eventual defeat at Yorktown  Virginia later in 1781  The Patriots  victory there guaranteed American independence   edit  Antebellum period On November 21  1789  North Carolina became the twelfth state to ratify the Constitution  In 1840  it completed the state capitol building in Raleigh  still standing today  Most of North Carolina s slave owners and large plantations were located in the eastern portion of the state  Although North Carolina s plantation system was smaller and less cohesive than those of Virginia  Georgia or South Carolina  there were significant numbers of planters concentrated in the counties around the port cities of Wilmington and Edenton  as well as suburban planters around the cities of Raleigh  Charlotte and Durham  Planters owning large estates wielded significant political and socio economic power in antebellum North Carolina  placing their interests above those of the generally non slave holding  yeoman  farmers of Western North Carolina  In mid century  the state s rural and commercial areas were connected by the construction of a 129 mile  208 km  wooden plank road  known as a  farmer s railroad   from Fayetteville in the east to Bethania  northwest of Winston Salem   27  Map of the roads and railroads of North Carolina  1854 Besides slaves  there were a number of free people of color in the state  Most were descended from free African Americans who had migrated along with neighbors from Virginia during the 18th century  After the Revolution  Quakers and Mennonites worked to persuade slaveholders to free their slaves  Some were inspired by their efforts and the language of men s rights  to arrange for manumission of their slaves  The number of free people of color rose markedly in the first couple of decades after the Revolution  34  On October 25  1836 construction began on the Wilmington and Raleigh Railroad 35  to connect the port city of Wilmington with the state capital of Raleigh  In 1849 the North Carolina Railroad was created by act of the legislature to extend that railroad west to Greensboro  High Point  and Charlotte  During the Civil War the Wilmington to Raleigh stretch of the railroad would be vital to the Confederate war effort  supplies shipped into Wilmington would be moved by rail through Raleigh to the Confederate capital of Richmond  Virginia  During the antebellum period  North Carolina was an overwhelmingly rural state  even by Southern standards  In 1860 only one North Carolina town  the port city of Wilmington  had a population of more than 10 000  Raleigh  the state capital  had barely more than 5 000 residents  While slaveholding was slightly less concentrated than in some Southern states  according to the 1860 census  more than 330 000 people  or 33  of the population of 992 622 were enslaved African Americans  They lived and worked chiefly on plantations in the eastern Tidewater  In addition  30 463 free people of color lived in the state  They were also concentrated in the eastern coastal plain  especially at port cities such as Wilmington and New Bern where they had access to a variety of jobs  Free African Americans were allowed to vote until 1835  when the state revoked their right to vote   edit  American Civil War Main article  North Carolina in the American Civil War Further information  American Civil War Union captures Fort Fisher  1865  In 1860  North Carolina was a slave state  in which about one third of the population of 992 622 were enslaved African Americans  This was a smaller proportion than many Southern states  In addition  the state had just over 30 000 Free Negroes  36  The state did not vote to join the Confederacy until President Abraham Lincoln called on it to invade its sister state  South Carolina  becoming the last or second to last state to officially join the Confederacy  The title of  last to join the Confederacy  has been disputed because Tennessee informally seceded on May 7  1861  making North Carolina the last to secede on May 20  1861  37  38  However  the Tennessee legislature did not formally vote to secede until June 8  1861  39  North Carolina was the site of few battles  but it provided at least 125 000 troops to the Confederacy  far more than any other state  Approximately 40 000 of those troops never returned home  dying of disease  battlefield wounds  and starvation  North Carolina also supplied about 15 000 Union troops  40  Elected in 1862  Governor Zebulon Baird Vance tried to maintain state autonomy against Confederate President Jefferson Davis in Richmond  Even after secession  some North Carolinians refused to support the Confederacy  This was particularly true of non slave owning farmers in the state s mountains and western Piedmont region  Some of these farmers remained neutral during the war  while some covertly supported the Union cause during the conflict  Approximately 2 000 North Carolinians from western North Carolina enlisted in the Union Army and fought for the North in the war  and two additional Union Army regiments were raised in the coastal areas of the state that were occupied by Union forces in 1862 and 1863  Even so  Confederate troops from all parts of North Carolina served in virtually all the major battles of the Army of Northern Virginia  the Confederacy s most famous army  The largest battle fought in North Carolina was at Bentonville  which was a futile attempt by Confederate General Joseph Johnston to slow Union General William Tecumseh Sherman s advance through the Carolinas in the spring of 1865  27  In April 1865  after losing the Battle of Morrisville  Johnston surrendered to Sherman at Bennett Place  in what is today Durham  North Carolina  This was the last major Confederate Army to surrender  North Carolina s port city of Wilmington was the last Confederate port to fall to the Union  It fell in the spring of 1865 after the nearby Second Battle of Fort Fisher  Bennett Place historic site in Durham  North Carolina  The first Confederate soldier to be killed in the Civil War was Private Henry Wyatt  a North Carolinian  He was killed in the Battle of Big Bethel in June 1861  At the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863  the 26th North Carolina Regiment participated in Pickett Pettigrew s Charge and advanced the farthest into the Northern lines of any Confederate regiment  During the Battle of Chickamauga the 58th North Carolina Regiment advanced farther than any other regiment on Snodgrass Hill to push back the remaining Union forces from the battlefield  At Appomattox Court House in Virginia in April 1865  the 75th North Carolina
