Year 2011 U S  Federal Spending   Cash or Budget Basis  Fiscal Year 2011 U S  Federal Receipts  The Budget of the United States Government is the President s proposal to the U S  Congress which recommends funding levels for the next fiscal year  beginning October 1  Congressional decisions are governed by rules and legislation regarding the federal budget process  Budget committees set spending limits for the House and Senate committees and for Appropriations subcommittees  which then approve individual appropriations bills to allocate funding to various federal programs  After Congress approves an appropriations bill  it is sent to the President  who may sign it into law  or may veto it  A vetoed bill is sent back to Congress  which can pass it into law with a two thirds majority in each chamber  Congress may also combine all or some appropriations bills into an omnibus reconciliation bill  In addition  the president may request and the Congress may pass supplemental appropriations bills or emergency supplemental appropriations bills  Several government agencies provide budget data and analysis  These include the Government Accountability Office  GAO   Congressional Budget Office  the Office of Management and Budget  OMB  and the U S  Treasury Department  These agencies have reported that the federal government is facing a series of important financing challenges  In the short run  tax revenues have declined significantly due to a severe recession and tax policy choices  while expenditures have expanded for wars  unemployment insurance and other safety net spending  1  2  In the long run  expenditures related to healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid are projected to grow faster than the economy overall as the population matures  3  4  Contents 1 Budget principles 1 1 Federal budget data 1 2 Federal budget projections 2 Major receipt categories 2 1 Tax policy 2 1 1 Tax descriptions 2 1 2 Tax expenditures 3 Major

3 Budget games and simulations  edit  Budget principles The U S  Constitution  Article I  section 9  clause 7  states that   n o money shall be drawn from the Treasury  but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law  and a regular Statement and Account of Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time   Each year  the President of the United States submits his budget request to Congress for the following fiscal year as required by the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921  Current law  31 U S C    1105 a   requires the president to submit a budget no earlier than the first Monday in January  and no later than the first Monday in February  Typically  presidents submit budgets on the first Monday in February  The budget submission has been delayed  however  in some new presidents  first year when previous president belonged to a different party  The federal budget is calculated largely on a cash basis  That is  revenues and outlays are recognized when transactions are made  Therefore  the full long term costs of entitlement programs such as Medicare  Social Security  and the federal portion of Medicaid are not reflected in the federal budget  By contrast  many businesses and some other national governments have adopted forms of accrual accounting  which recognizes obligations and revenues when they are incurred  The costs of some federal credit and loan programs  according to provisions of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990  are calculated on a net present value basis  5  Federal agencies cannot spend money unless funds are authorized and appropriated  Typically  separate Congressional committees have jurisdiction over authorization and appropriations  The House and Senate Appropriations Committees currently have 12 subcommittees  which are responsible for drafting the 12 regular appropriations bills that determine amounts of discretionary spending for various federal programs  Appropriations bills must pass both the House and Senate and then be signed by the president in order to give federal agencies legal authority to spend  6  In many recent years  regular appropriations bills have been combined into  omnibus  bills  Congress may also pass  special  or  emergency  appropriations  Spending that is deemed an  emergency  is exempt from certain Congressional budget enforcement rules  Funds for disaster relief have sometimes come from supplemental appropriations  such as after Hurricane Katrina  In other cases  funds included in emergency supplemental appropriations bills support activities not obviously related to actual emergencies  such as parts of the 2000 Census of Population and Housing  Special appropriations have been used to fund most of the costs of war and occupation in Iraq and Afghanistan so far  Budget resolutions and appropriations bills  which reflect spending priorities of Congress  will usually differ from funding levels in the president s budget  The president  however  retains substantial influence over the budget process through his veto power and through his congressional allies when his party has a majority in Congress  The amount of budget authority and outlays for a fiscal year usually differ because budget authority from a previous fiscal year in some cases can be used for outlays in the current fiscal year  Budget authority is the authority provided by federal law to enter into financial obligations that will result in immediate or future outlays involving federal government funds  Outlays refer to the issuance of checks  disbursement of cash  or electronic transfer of funds made to liquidate a federal obligation  and is usually synonymous with  expenditure  or  spending   The term  appropriations  refers to budget authority to incur obligations and to make payments from the Treasury for specified purposes  Some military and some housing programs have multi year appropriations  in which budget authority is specified for several coming fiscal years   edit  Federal budget data Several government agencies provide budget data  These include the Government Accountability Office  GAO   the Congressional Budget Office  the Office of Management and Budget  OMB  and the U S  Treasury Department  The CBO publishes The Budget and Economic Outlook in January  which is typically updated in August  It also publishes a Monthly Budget Review  The OMB  which is responsible for organizing the President s budget presented in February  typically issues a budget update in July  The GAO and the Treasury issue Financial Statements of the U S  Government  usually in the December following the close of the federal fiscal year  which occurs September 30  There is a corresponding Citizen s Guide  a short summary  The Treasury Department also produces a Combined Statement of Receipts  Outlays  and Balances each December for the preceding fiscal year  which provides detailed data on federal financial activities  Historical tables within the President s Budget  OMB  provide a wide range of data on federal government finances  Many of the data series begin in 1940 and include estimates of the President s Budget for 2009 2014  Additionally  Table 1 1 provides data on receipts  outlays  and surpluses or deficits for 1901 1939 and for earlier multi year periods  This document is composed of 17 sections  each of which has one or more tables  Each section covers a common theme  Section 1  for example  provides an overview of the budget and off budget totals  Section 2 provides tables on receipts by source  and Section 3 shows outlays by function  When a section contains several tables  the general rule is to start with tables showing the broadest overview data and then work down to more detailed tables  The purpose of these tables is to present a broad range of historical budgetary data in one convenient reference source and to provide relevant comparisons likely to be most useful  The most common comparisons are in terms of proportions  e g   each major receipt category as a percentage of total receipts and of the gross domestic product   7   edit  Federal budget projections The CBO calculates 35 year baseline projections  which are used extensively in the budget process  Baseline projections are intended to reflect spending under current law  and are not intended as predictions of the most likely path of the economy  During the George W  Bush Administration  the OMB presented five year projections  but presented 45 year projections in the FY2010 budget submission  The CBO and the GAO issue long term projections from time to time   edit  Major receipt categories Main article  Taxation in the United States During FY 2011  the federal government collected approximately  2 3 trillion in tax revenue or 15 4  GDP  Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes  47    Social Security Social Insurance taxes  36    and corporate taxes  8    8  Other types included excise  estate and gift taxes  Tax revenues have averaged approximately 18 3  of gross domestic product  GDP  over the 1970 2009 period  generally ranging plus or minus 2  from that level  Tax revenues are significantly affected by the economy  Recessions typically reduce government tax collections as economic activity slows  For example  tax revenues declined from  2 5 trillion in 2008 to  2 1 trillion in 2009  and remained at that level in 2010  During 2009  individual income taxes declined 20   while corporate taxes declined 50   At 15 1  of GDP  the 2009 and 2010 collections were the lowest level of the past 50 years  8  9   edit  Tax policy Revenue and Expense as   GDP   edit  Tax descriptions The federal personal income tax is progressive  meaning a higher marginal tax rate is applied to higher ranges of income  For example  in 2010 the tax rate that applied to the first  17 000 in taxable income for a couple filing jointly was 10   while the rate applied to income over  379 150 was 35   The top marginal tax rate has declined considerably since 1980  For example  the top tax rate was lowered from 70  to 50  in 1980 and reached as low as 28  in 1988  The most recent changes were the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003  extended by President Obama in 2010  which lowered the top rate from 39 6  to 35   10  There are numerous exemptions and deductions  that typically result in a range of 35 40  of U S  households owing no federal income tax  The recession and tax cut stimulus measures increased this to 51  for 2009  versus 38  in 2007  11  The federal payroll tax  FICA  is a flat tax used to fund Social Security and Medicare  For the Social Security portion  employers and employees each pay 6 2  of the workers gross pay  a total of 12 4   The Social Security portion is capped at  106 800  meaning income above this amount is not subject to the tax  The Medicare portion is also paid by employer and employee each at 1 45  and is not capped  12  The payroll tax is considered by some to be a form of social insurance rather than a tax  due to the benefits these programs pay to qualified recipients  For calendar year 2011  the employee s portion of the payroll tax was reduced to 4 2  as an economic stimulus measure  13   edit  Tax expenditures The term  tax expenditures  refers to income exemptions or deductions that reduce the tax collections that would be made applying a particular tax rate alone  According to the Center for American Progress  annual tax expenditures have increased from  526 billion in 1982 to  1 025 billion in 2010  adjusted for inflation  measured in 2010 dollars   14  Economist Mark Zandi wrote in July 2011 that tax expenditures should be considered a form of government spending  15  In November 2009  The Economist estimated the additional federal tax revenue generated from eliminating certain tax expenditures  for the 2013 2014 period  These included  income exemptions for employer provided health insurance   215 billion   and various income deductions such as mortgage interest   147B   state  amp  local taxes   65B   capital gains on homes   60B   property taxes   33B  and municipal bond interest   37B   These total  557 billion  All of these steps together would reduce the projected deficit at that time by nearly half  16  The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in 2008 the amount of federal tax expenditures for the five year  2008 2012  period  Examples include  Exclusions for healthcare insurance paid for by employers  680B  reduced tax rate on dividends and long term capital gains  668B  deduction for mortgage interest on owner occupied residences  444B  exclusions for pre tax defined benefit or defined contribution pension contributions such as to 401K plans  554B  deductions for non business state and local income taxes  242B  deductions for charitable contributions  205B  exclusion of benefits under healthcare insurance  cafeteria  plans  201B  exclusion for interest on state and local government bonds  147B  exclusion for Medicare benefits  134B  deduction for real property taxes  112B  dependent credit for children under 17 years of age  105B  exclusion for capital gains on sale of primary residence  90B  and deductions for long term care and other medical expenses  68B  17   edit  Major expenditure categories Main article  Expenditures in the United States federal budget During FY 2011  the federal government spent  3 60 trillion on a budget or cash basis  up 4  vs  FY 2010 spending of  3 46 trillion and up 20  versus FY2008 spend of  2 97 trillion  Major categories of FY 2011 spending included  Medicare  amp  Medicaid   835B or 24    Social Security   725B or 20    Defense Department   700B or 19    non defense discretionary   646B or 19    other   465B or 12   and interest   227B or 6    Expenditures are classified as mandatory  with payments required by specific laws  or discretionary  with payment amounts renewed annually as part of the budget process  Expenditures averaged 20 6  GDP from 1971 to 2008  generally ranging    2  GDP from that level  The 2011 and 2010 spend were both 24 1  GDP  versus 2008 spend of 20 8  GDP  8   edit  Mandatory spending and entitlements Social Security   Ratio of Covered Workers to Retirees Entitlement Spending Risks Social Security  Medicare  and Medicaid expenditures are funded by permanent appropriations and so are considered mandatory spending  Social Security and Medicare are sometimes called  entitlements   because people meeting relevant eligibility requirements are legally entitled to benefits  although most pay taxes into these programs throughout their working lives  Some programs  such as Food Stamps  are appropriated entitlements  Some mandatory spending  such as Congressional salaries  is not part of any entitlement program  Mandatory spending accounted for 53  of total federal outlays in FY2008  with net interest payments accounting for an additional 8 5   18  Mandatory spending is expected to increase as a share of GDP  This is due in part to demographic trends  as the number of workers continues declining relative to those receiving benefits  For example  the number of workers per retiree was 5 1 in 1960  this declined to 3 0 in 2010 and is projected to decline to 2 2 by 2030  19  20  These programs are also affected by per person costs  which are also expected to increase at a rate significantly higher than the economy  This unfavorable combination of demographics and per capita rate increases is expected to drive both Social Security and Medicare into large deficits during the 21st century  Unless these long term fiscal imbalances are addressed by reforms to these programs  raising taxes or drastic cuts in discretionary programs  the federal government will at some point be unable to pay its obligations without significant risk to the value of the dollar  inflation   21  22  Medicare was established in 1965 and expanded thereafter  In 2009  the program covered an estimated 45 million persons  38 million aged and 7 million disabled   It consists of four distinct parts which are funded differently  Hospital Insurance  mainly funded by a dedicated payroll tax of 2 9  of earnings  shared equally between employers and workers  Supplementary Medical Insurance  funded through beneficiary premiums  set at 25  of estimated program costs for the aged  and general revenues  the remaining amount  approximately 75    Medicare Advantage  a private plan option for beneficiaries  funded through the Hospital Insurance and Supplementary Medical Insurance trust funds  and the  Part D  prescription drug benefits  for which funding is included in the Supplementary Medical Insurance trust fund and is financed through beneficiary premiums  about 25   and general revenues  about 75    23  Spending on Medicare and Medicaid is projected to grow dramatically in coming decades  The number of persons enrolled in Medicare is expected to increase from 47 million in 2010 to 80 million by 2030  24  While the same demographic trends that affect Social Security also affect Medicare  rapidly rising medical prices appear to be a more important cause of projected spending increases  CBO expects Medicare and Medicaid to continue growing  rising from 5 3  GDP in 2009 to 10 0  in 2035 and 19 0  by 2082  CBO has indicated healthcare spending per beneficiary is the primary long term fiscal challenge  25  Various reform strategies were proposed for healthcare  26  and in March 2010  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted as a means of health care reform  Social Security is a social insurance program officially called  Old Age  Survivors  and Disability Insurance   OASDI   in reference to its three components  It is primarily funded through a dedicated payroll tax of 12 4   During 2009  total benefits of  686 billion were paid out versus income  taxes and interest  of  807 billion  a  121 billion annual surplus  An estimated 156 million people paid into the program and 53 million received benefits  roughly 2 94 workers per beneficiary  27  Since the Greenspan Commission in the early 1980s  Social Security has cumulatively collected far more in payroll taxes dedicated to the program than it has paid out to recipients nearly  2 4 trillion by 2008  This annual surplus is credited to Social Security trust funds that hold special non marketable Treasury securities  and this surplus amount is commonly referred to as the  Social Security Trust Fund   The proceeds are paid into the U S  Treasury where they may be used for other government purposes  Social Security spending will increase sharply over the next decades  largely due to the retirement of the baby boom generation  The number of program recipients is expected to increase from 44 million in 2010 to 73 million in 2030  24  Program spending is projected to rise from 4 8  of GDP in 2010 to 5 9  of GDP by 2030  where it will stabilize  28  The Social Security Administration projects that an increase in payroll taxes equivalent to 1 9  of the payroll tax base or 0 7  of GDP would be necessary to put the Social Security program in fiscal balance for the next 75 years  Over an infinite time horizon  these shortfalls average 3 4  of the payroll tax base and 1 2  of GDP  29  Various reforms have been debated for Social Security  Examples include reducing future annual cost of living adjustments  COLA  provided to recipients  raising the retirement age  and raising the income limit subject to the payroll tax   106 800 in 2009   30  31  Because of the mandatory nature of the program and large accumulated surplus in the Social Security Trust Fund  the Social Security system has the legal authority to compel the government to borrow to pay all promised benefits through 2037  when the Trust Fund is expected to be exhausted  Thereafter  the program under current law will pay approximately 75  78  of promised benefits for the remainder of the century  32   edit  Other spending Defense Spending 2000 2011  FY 2010 Estimated Federal Spending per 2011 Budget Military spending  The military budget of the United States during FY 2011 was approximately  740 billion in expenses for the Department of Defense  DoD    141 billion for veteran expenses  and  48 billion in expenses for the Department of Homeland Security  for a total of  929 billion  33  The U S  defense budget  excluding spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  Homeland Security  and Veteran s Affairs  is around 5  of GDP  Adding these other costs places defense spending between 6  and 7  of GDP  The DoD baseline budget  excluding supplemental funding for the wars  has grown from  297 billion in FY2001 to a budgeted  534 billion for FY2010  an 81  increase  34  According to the CBO  defense spending grew 9  annually on average from fiscal year 2000 2009  35  Much of the costs for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have not been funded through regular appropriations bills  but through emergency supplemental appropriations bills  As such  most of these expenses were not included in the budget deficit calculation prior to FY2010  Some budget experts argue that emergency supplemental appropriations bills do not receive the same level of legislative care as regular appropriations bills  36  Non defense discretionary spending is used to fund the executive departments  e g   the Department of Education  and independent agencies  e g   the Environmental Protection Agency   although these do receive a smaller amount of mandatory funding as well  Discretionary budget authority is established annually by Congress  as opposed to mandatory spending that is required by laws that span multiple years  such as Social Security or Medicare  The federal government spent approximately  660 billion during 2010 on the Cabinet Departments and Agencies  excluding the Department of Defense  representing 19  of budgeted expenditures 8  or about 4 5  of GDP  Several politicians and think tanks have proposed freezing non defense discretionary spending at particular levels and holding this spending constant for various periods of time  President Obama proposed freezing discretionary spending representing approximately 12  of the budget in his 2011 State of the Union address  37  Interest expense  Budgeted net interest on the public debt was approximately  189 billion in FY2009  5  of spending   During FY2009  the government also accrued a non cash interest expense of  192 billion for intra governmental debt  primarily the Social Security Trust Fund  for a total interest expense of  381 billion  38  Net interest costs paid on the public debt declined from  242 billion in 2008 to  189 billion in 2009 because of lower interest rates  39  Should these rates return to historical averages  the interest cost would increase dramatically  Historian Niall Ferguson described the risk that foreign investors would demand higher interest rates as the U S  debt levels increase over time in a November 2009 interview  40  Public debt owned by foreigners has increased to approximately 50  of the total or approximately  3 4 trillion  41  As a result  nearly 50  of the interest payments are now leaving the country  which is different from past years when interest was paid to U S  citizens holding the public debt  Interest expenses are projected to grow dramatically as the U S  debt increases and interest rates rise from very low levels in 2009 to more typical historical levels   edit  Understanding deficits and debt Deficit and Debt Increases 2001 2010  Main article  United States public debt The annual budget deficit is the difference between actual cash collections and budgeted spending  a partial measure of total spending  during a given fiscal year  which runs from October 1 to September 30  Since 1970  the U S  federal government has run deficits for all but four years  1998 2001  42  contributing to a total debt of  15 35 trillion as of January 2012  43  The fiscal year 2011  total budget  deficit was  1 296 trillion or 8 7  GDP  similar to the  1 294 trillion or 9 0  GDP in 2010  These deficits are considerably higher than pre crisis levels  which ranged from a  236 billion  2 4  GDP  surplus in 2000 to a  459 billion  3 2  GDP  deficit in 2008  8  The national debt increase during a given year is not the same as the  total budget  deficit commonly reported  due to a variety of accounting complexities involved  These differences can make it more challenging to determine how much the government actually spends relative to tax revenues  The increase in the national debt during a given year is a helpful measure to determine this amount  From FY 2003 2007  the national debt increased approximately  550 billion per year on average  For the first time in FY 2008  the U S  added  1 trillion to the national debt as the effects of a severe global financial crisis became apparent  Debt increases rose to  1 88 trillion in 2009 and  1 65 trillion in 2010 as the crisis continued  44  In relative terms  from 2003 2007 the government spent roughly  1 20 for each  1 00 it collected in taxes  This increased to  1 40 in FY2008 and  1 90 in FY2009  The total federal debt is divided into  debt held by the public  and  intra governmental debt   The debt held by the public refers to U S  government securities or other obligations held by investors  e g   bonds  bills and notes   while Social Security and other federal trust funds are part of the intra governmental debt  As of January 31  2012 the total debt was  15 4 trillion  with debt held by the public of  10 6 trillion and intragovernmental debt of  4 8 trillion  45  Debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP rose from 34 7  in 2000 to 40 3  in 2008 and 62 1  in 2010  46  U S  GDP was approximately  14 5 trillion during 2010 and an estimated  15 trillion for 2011 based on activity during the first two quarters  47  This means the total debt is roughly the size of GDP  Economists debate the level of debt relative to GDP that signals a  red line  or dangerous level  or if any such level exists  48  By comparison  China s budget deficit was 1 6  of its  10 trillion GDP in 2010  with a debt to GDP ratio of 16   49  The CBO reported several types of risk factors related to rising debt levels in a July 2010 publication  A growing portion of savings would go towards purchases of government debt  rather than investments in productive capital goods such as factories and computers  leading to lower output and incomes than would otherwise occur  If higher marginal tax rates were used to pay rising interest costs  savings would be reduced and work would be discouraged  Rising interest costs would force reductions in important government programs  Restrictions to the ability of policymakers to use fiscal policy to respond to economic challenges  and An increased risk of a sudden fiscal crisis  in which investors demand higher interest rates  50   edit  CBO scenarios CBO Public Debt Under  Extended  and  Alternate  Scenarios The CBO reported during June 2011 two scenarios for how debt held by the public will change during the 2010 2035 time period  The  extended baseline scenario  assumes that the Bush tax cuts  extended by Obama  will expire per current law in 2012  It also assumes the alternative minimum tax  AMT  will be allowed to affect more middle class families  reductions in Medicare reimbursement rates to doctors will occur  and that revenues reach 23  GDP by 2035  much higher than the historical average 18   Under this scenario  activities such as national defense and a wide variety of domestic programs  excluding Social Security  Medicare  and interest  would decline to the lowest percentage of GDP since before World War II  Under this scenario  public debt rises from 69  GDP in 2011 to 84  by 2035  with interest payments absorbing 4  of GDP vs  1  in 2011  51  CBO estimated in August 2011 that if laws currently  on the books  were enforced without changes  meaning the  extended baseline scenario  described above is implemented along with deficit reductions from the Budget Control Act of 2011  the deficit would decline from 8 5  GDP in 2011 to around 1  GDP by 2021  52  53  The  alternative fiscal scenario  more closely assumes the continuation of present trends  such as permanently extending the Bush tax cuts  restricting the reach of the AMT  and keeping Medicare reimbursement rates at the current level  the so called  doc fix   versus declining by one third as mandated under current law   Revenues are assumed to remain around the historical average 18  GDP  Under this scenario  public debt rises from 69  GDP in 2011 to 100  by 2021 and approaches 190  by 2035  51  The CBO reported in June 2011   Many budget analysts believe that the alternative fiscal scenario presents a more realistic picture of the nation s underlying fiscal policies than the extended baseline scenario does  The explosive path of federal debt under the alternative fiscal scenario underscores the need for large and rapid policy changes to put the nation on a sustainable fiscal course   51  CBO reported in September 2011   The nation cannot continue to sustain the spending programs and policies of the past with the tax revenues it has been accustomed to paying  Citizens will either have to pay more for their government  accept less in government services and benefits  or both   54   edit  Contemporary issues and debates Main article  Political debates about the United States federal budget See also  Social Security debate in the United States and Health care reform debate in the United States Topics frequently in the news in the 2010 2011 time period included  a  the effect of the Bush tax cuts and related extension  b  causes of deficit and debt increases  c  the effects of fraud  waste and earmarks  d  whether a  danger level  of debt exists  and e  the effects of globalization and free trade on employment  55  among others  Many of the debates surrounding the United States federal budget center around competing macroeconomic schools of thought  In general  Democrats favor the principles of Keynesian economics to encourage economic growth via a mixed economy of both private and public enterprise  a welfare state  and strong regulatory oversight  Conversely  Republicans generally support applying the principles of either laissez faire or supply side economics to grow the economy via small government  low taxes  limited regulation  and free enterprise  56  57  Debates have surrounded the appropriate size and role of the federal government since the founding of the country  These debates also deal with questions of morality  income equality and intergenerational equity  For example  Congress adding to the debt today may or may not enhance the quality of life for future generations  who must also bear the additional interest and taxation burden  58  Economic growth and employment are key factors driving recent deficits  The Congressional Budget Office  CBO  estimated in October 2011 that approximately one third of the deficit projected for fiscal year 2012 is due to economic factors  which have caused safety net expenditures to increase and tax revenues to decline with high unemployment  59  The U S  last balanced its budget in 2001  Between 2001 and 2010  spending increased by 5 6  GDP  from 18 2  GDP in 2001 to 23 8  GDP in 2010   while revenues declined by 4 6  GDP  from 19 5  GDP in 2001 to 14 9  GDP in 2010   resulting in a 9 4  GDP deficit  Medicare Medicaid spending increased by 1 9  GDP and defense spending increased by 1 7  GDP  Individual income tax revenues fell by 3 5  GDP and payroll taxes fell by 0 8  GDP  60  61  Economist Paul Krugman summarized these causes in May 2011   What happened to the budget surplus the federal government had in 2000  The answer is  three main things  First  there were the Bush tax cuts  which added roughly  2 trillion to the national debt over the last decade  Second  there were the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  which added an additional  1 1 trillion or so  And third was the Great Recession  which led both to a collapse in revenue and to a sharp rise in spending on unemployment insurance and other safety net programs   62  CBO has estimated that letting current laws take effect would significantly reduce future budget deficits  For example  the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003  extended by President Obama in 2009  are scheduled to expire at the end of 2012  Other deficit reducers per CBO include allowing other tax cuts enacted in 2009 and 2010 by President Obama to expire in 2012  allowing the alternative minimum tax  AMT  to affect more taxpayers  and reducing Medicare reimbursements to doctors  These and other current laws  if allowed to take effect  reduce the deficit from an estimated 4 7  GDP in 2021 to 1 2  GDP  63  Total deficit reduction could be as high as  7 1 trillion over a decade if current law is enforced and not overridden  53   edit  Solving the problem Report of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform Public Debt as   GDP Under Various Scenarios Main article  Deficit reduction in the United States  edit  Strategies Strategies for addressing the deficit problem may include policy choices regarding taxation and spending  along with policies designed to increase economic growth and reduce unemployment  These policy decisions may be evaluated in the context of a framework  64  Promote economic growth and employment  A fast growing economy offers the win win outcome of a larger proverbial economic pie to divide  with higher employment and tax revenues  lower safety net spending and a lower debt to GDP ratio  Make equitable trade offs  Many budget choices have win lose outcomes  reflecting how government revenues are divided  with some benefiting and others incurring costs  For example  taking away benefits from those in or near retirement may be considered inequitable  while phasing out retirement benefits for younger workers may be considered less so  Keep short  and long term issues in perspective  Healthcare cost inflation and an aging population are the primary long term deficit drivers  Unemployment and various tax and spending policy choices are the primary short term deficit drivers  Measures to encourage economic growth today can be implemented along with other measures to reduce future deficits  65  Limit or avoid future spending increases  Policy choices may focus on preventing future increases via freezes or reducing annual rates of increase  as federal spending has not declined year over year in nominal dollars since at least 1970  Annual growth rates since 2001 in the top three expenditure categories  Healthcare  Social Security  and Defense  are far above the economic growth rate  Invest productively  Some spending can be categorized as investments that lower future deficits  For example  if infrastructure  education or R amp D investments could make U S  workers and products more competitive or generate a revenue stream  these could reduce future deficits  Examples might include installing windows that reduce energy costs  toll roads and bridges  or power plants  64  Avoid uncertainty and unnecessary regulation  Complex legislation may create uncertainty regarding future costs of doing business  which affects investment decisions made by businesses and households  66  Implement budget process reforms  Budget rules could be implemented that require new legislation or programs to be funded by either cutting other spending or raising taxes  i e    Pay as you go  or PAYGO rules   67  The CBO reported in September 2011 that   Given the aging of the population and rising costs for health care  attaining a sustainable federal budget will require the United States to deviate from the policies of the past 40 years in at least one of the following ways  Raise federal revenues significantly above their average share of GDP  Make major changes to the sorts of benefits provided for Americans when they become older  or Substantially reduce the role of the rest of the federal government relative to the size of the economy   68  During testimony before the Congressional Joint Deficit Reduction Committee in September 2011  CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf counseled members of Congress to make decisions about the role of the federal government  then make policy choices to obtain the revenue necessary to fund those roles  to put the U S  on a sustainable fiscal path  69   edit  Specific proposals A variety of government task forces  expert panels  private institutions  politicians  and journalists have made recommendations for addressing the deficit and debt  President Obama established a budget reform commission  the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform  which released a draft report in December 2010  It included various tax and spend adjustments to bring long run government tax revenue and spending into line at approximately 21  of GDP  with  4 trillion debt avoidance over 10 years  70  President Obama announced a 10 year  2012 2021  plan in September 2011 called   Living Within Our Means and Investing in the Future  The President s Plan for Economic Growth and Deficit Reduction   The plan included tax increases on the wealthy  along with cuts in future spending on defense and Medicare  Social Security was excluded from the plan  The plan included a net debt avoidance of  3 2 trillion over 10 years  If the Budget Control Act of 2011 is included  this adds another  1 2 trillion in deficit reduction for a total of  4 4 trillion  71  The House of Representatives Committee on the Budget  chaired by Rep  Paul Ryan  R   released The Path to Prosperity  Restoring America s Promise  The Path focuses on tax reform  lowering income tax rates and reducing tax expenditures or loopholes   spending cuts and controls  and redesign of the Medicare and Medicaid programs  It does not propose significant changes to Social Security  72  The Congressional Progressive Caucus  CPC  proposed  The People s Budget  in April 2011  which it claimed would balance the budget by 2021 while maintaining debt as a   GDP under 65   It proposed reversing most of the Bush tax cuts  higher income tax rates on the wealthy and restoring the estate tax  investing in a jobs program  and reducing defense spending  73  The Peter G  Peterson Foundation solicited proposals from six organizations  which included the American Enterprise Institute  the Bipartisan Policy Center  the Center for American Progress  the Economic Policy Institute  The Heritage Foundation  and the Roosevelt Institute Campus Network  The recommendations of each group were reported in May 2011  74  The Bipartisan Policy Center sponsored a Debt Reduction Task Force  co chaired by Pete V  Domenici and Alice M  Rivlin  This panel created a report called  Restoring America s Future   which was published in November 2010  The plan claimed to stabilize the debt to GDP ratio at 60   with up to  6 trillion in debt avoidance over the 2011 2020 period  Specific plan elements included defense and non defense spending freezes for 4 5 years  income tax reform  elimination of tax expenditures  and a national sales tax or value added tax  VAT   75  76   edit  Timing of solutions How urgently should the U S  put plans in place to address its budget challenges  Fed Chair Ben Bernanke stated in January 2007   The longer we wait  the more severe  the more draconian  the more difficult the objectives are going to be  I think the right time to start was about 10 years ago   77   edit  Total outlays in recent budget submissions Annual U S  spending 1930 2014 alongside U
