March 1966   The comic s writer editor  Stan Lee  and its penciller and co plotter  Jack Kirby  had by the mid 1960s developed a collaborative technique known as the  Marvel Method   the two would discuss story ideas  Kirby would work from a brief synopsis to draw the individual scenes and plot details  and Lee would finally add the dialog and captions  When Kirby turned in his pencil art for the story  he included a new character he and Lee had not discussed  5  As Lee recalled in 1995   There  in the middle of the story we had so carefully worked out  was a nut on some sort of flying surfboard   6  He later expanded on this  recalling   I thought   Jack  this time you ve gone too far    7  Kirby explained that the story s agreed upon antagonist  a god like cosmic predator of planets named Galactus  should have some sort of herald  and that he created the surfboard  because I m tired of drawing spaceships   8  Taken by the noble features of the new character  who turned on his master to help defend Earth  Lee overcame his initial skepticism and began adding characterization  The Silver Surfer soon became a key part of the unfolding story  5  Following the Surfer s debut  Lee and Kirby brought him back as a recurring guest in Fantastic Four  55 61  72  and 74 77  ranging Oct  1966   Aug  1968   The character made his solo debut in the backup story of Fantastic Four Annual  5  Nov  1967   The following year  Lee launched the solo title The Silver Surfer  John Buscema was penciller for the first 17 issues of the series  with Kirby returning for the 18th and final issue  The first seven issues  which included anthological  Tales of the Watcher  backup stories  were 72 page  with advertising   25 cent  giants   as opposed to the typical 36 page  12 cent comics of the time  Thematically  the stories dealt with the Surfer s exile on Earth and the inhumanity of man as observed by this noble yet fallen hero  Though short lived  the series became known as one of Lee s most thoughtful and introspective works  9  Following his series  cancellation  the Surfer made sporadic appearances as a guest star or antagonist in such comic books as Thor  The Defenders  and Fantastic Four  Lee remained partial to the Surfer  and with Kirby collaborated on a seminal 1978 graphic novel starring the character  the only original story featured in the Marvel Fireside Books

reprinted in Marvel Fanfare  51  Englehart introduced many villains for Silver Surfer  as well as featured space politics involving Surfer s homeworld Zen La  which was caught in the middle of a renewed Kree Skrull War  However  issues regarding Englehart wanting to use his Avengers character Mantis as Silver Surfer s companion  as well as editorial refusing to let him use Thanos or other
