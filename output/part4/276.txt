Returns  3  He was joined by X2 screenwriters Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty  as well as John Ottman  composer and editor of the film  Though Singer  Harris and Dougherty did not produce a completed script  Singer revealed that at the time of his departure they had partially written a story treatment focusing on Jean Grey s resurrection  4  which would also introduce the villainness Emma Frost  a role intended for Sigourney Weaver  Gambit  a role intended for Keanu Reeves  and The Hellfire Club  5  Frost was an empath manipulating Jean s emotions in the treatment  and like the finished film Magneto desires to control her  Overwhelmed by her powers  Jean kills herself  but Jean s spirit survives and becomes a god like creature  which Dougherty compared to the star child in A Space Odyssey  6  New contracts for returning cast members were made  as the actors and actresses had signed for only two films  7  Hugh Jackman s contract included the approval of director  8  initially offering the position to Darren Aronofsky  with whom he had just finished filming on The Fountain  9  Joss Whedon  whose comic book  Gifted  having been integrated in the script s plot  turned down the offer because he was working on a Wonder Woman film  10 Rob Bowman 11  and Alex Proyas 12  were also rumored  though Proyas personally turned it down  citing feuds with Fox president Thomas Rothman on I  Robot  13 Zack Snyder was also approached  but he was already committed to 300  14  In February 2005  with still no director hired  Fox announced a May 5  2006 release date  with filming to start in July 2005  15  They later pushed the release date three weeks for Memorial Day weekend  and signed Matthew Vaughn to direct in March 2005  16  Vaughn cast Kelsey Grammer as The Beast  Dania Ramirez as Callisto  and Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut  but family issues led him to withdraw before filming began  17  18  Vaughn was also cautious of Fox wanting to rush production   I didn t have the time to make the movie that I wanted to make  I had a vision for how it should be   Vaughn reflected in a 2007 interview   and I wanted to make sure I was making a film as good as X Men 2  and I knew there was no way it could be   19  Brett Ratner  who was previously considered as the director for X Men in 1996  replaced Vaughn during pre production  18  On June 13  2005  a review of an incomplete early draft of the screenplay posted by Drew McWeeny from Ain t It Cool News sparked controversy from fans  due to certain main characters  storylines  20  however  that was the very first of over two dozen drafts of the script  Most notably the Golden Gate Bridge sequence was originally in the middle of the film  but Ratner decided it would create a more dramatic climax if moved to the end  21  which was originally to take place in Washington  D C  22  Mutants were initially held on Alcatraz as prisoners  but Ratner changed the bridge escape in the middle to highlight The Dark Phoenix rising scene in the climax  23  24  He also expanded Halle Berry s role as Storm  The actress stated during interviews for X2 that she would not return unless the character had a significant presence comparable to the comic book version  25 Maggie Grace was considered for Kitty Pryde Shadowcat 18  before Ratner cast Ellen Page  He was impressed with her performance in Hard Candy and did not require an audition  26   edit  Writing Simon Kinberg was hired as writer for X Men 3 in August 2004  and was joined by Zak Penn in January 2005  Kinberg wanted  The Dark Phoenix Saga  to be the emotional plot of the film  while  Gifted  would serve as the political focus  27  Killing Cyclops was Fox s decision  based on the availability of actor James Marsden  who was cast in Singer s Superman Returns  The studio considered killing him off screen with a dialogue reference  but Kinberg and Penn insisted that Jean kill him  emphasizing their relationship  Xavier s death was intended to match the impact of Spock s demise in Star Trek II  The Wrath of Khan  as Fox felt the script called for a dramatic turning point  Kinberg and Penn were originally cautious but grew to like the idea of killing off Xavier  They decided to write a post credits scene suggesting the character s return for a sequel  28  As the studio was simultaneously developing X Men Origins  Wolverine  limitations were set on which mutants could be used for cameo appearances in X Men 3 in an attempt to avoid risking character development for Wolverine  29 Gambit initially appeared in the Battle of Alcatraz climax with the X Men  but the writers did not want to introduce a fan favorite character and  not be able to do him justice   Kinberg reasoned  there just wasn t enough space   27 Alan Cumming had been uncomfortable with the long hours he had to take with the prosthetic makeup as Nightcrawler in X2 but still planned to return for the sequel  The part for Nightcrawler was so minimal  however  that the studio felt it was not worthwhile to go through the long and costly makeup process  and the character was cut  30  Kinberg felt that  there wasn t much left to do with the character  It also felt like he might tread a little bit on the terrain of Beast  in terms of similarities in the characters and their political standpoints in terms of dealing with their mutancy   Nightcrawler s absence was later explained in the tie in video game  27   edit  Filming X Men  The Last Stand began shooting in August 2005 and ended in January 2006  Much of the film was shot at Vancouver Film Studios in Vancouver  British Columbia  Canada  30  Locations included the Hatley Park National Historic Site and Royal Roads University  which doubled for the X Mansion  31  According to associate producer Dave Gordon   This is the biggest production ever filmed in Canada  It used to be X2  now it s X3   30  The  210 million budget also made The Last Stand the most expensive film to be made at the time  1  8  32  The film s record would be first broken by Pirates of the Caribbean  Dead Man s Chest s  225 million budget  33  Fox Filmed Entertainment co chairmen Thomas Rothman and Jim Gianopulos debated whether Rogue should give Iceman a passionate kiss at the film s end or simply hold his hand  The two executives screened The Last Stand for their daughters as well as the studio s female marketing executives  and the hand holding prevailed  Gianopulos stated that the kissing  was all about sex  and we didn t want that   34   edit  Visual effects Eleven companies were hired for the visual effects  35  which started in April 2005  before the director had even been announced  Special effects supervisor John Bruno estimates one sixth of the effects budget was spent on the Golden Gate Bridge scene  which employed both computer generated imagery and a miniature of the bridge  1  Another notable effect was  digital skin grafting   which rejuvenated the faces of senior actors Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen by complex keyframing  though CGI was not used  36  The film has extensive wirework  where many of the actors performed some of their own stunts  The whirlwind wire stunt performed by Halle Berry during one fight scene reportedly caused Berry to become sick   edit  Music X Men  The Last Stand  Original Motion Picture Soundtrack Film score by John Powell Released May 23  2006 Genre

collected by Rotten Tomatoes  57  of the critics enjoyed X Men  The Last Stand with an average score of 5 9 10  The film was more balanced with the 42 reviews in the websites  Top Critics  poll  receiving a 52  approval rating and a 5 6 10 score  53  By comparison  Metacritic calculated an average score of 58 100  based on 38 reviews  54  Ebert and Roeper gave the film a  two thumbs up  rating  with Ebert stating  I liked the action  I liked the absurdity  I liked the incongruous use and misuse of mutant powers  and I especially liked the way it introduces all of those political issues and lets them fight it out with the special effects   55 Salon com gave it a mixed review  noting that it was  only half a mess   and that Ratner  could have stuck a bit more closely to the  Dark Phoenix  narrative than he did   However  Salon did note that that third act captured some of the original story s  majesty   56  Justin Chang of Variety said the film is  a wham bam sequel noticeably lacking in the pop gravitas  moody atmospherics and emotional weight that made the first two Marvel comicbook adaptations so rousingly successful   57 Frank Lovece of Film Journal International said   A risk taking script with genuine consequences elevates this     above the lackluster direction of Brett Ratner  whose competent mechanics move the story efficiently but with very little soul   58  Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly called it a   diminished sequel  a brute force enterprise  and held it as an example of  what happens when movies are confused with sandwich shops as franchise opportunities   59  The Minneapolis Star Tribune characterized Ratner s approach as  Forget subtlety  Let s blow things up   60  David Edelstein of New York magazine called it  just another big budget B movie  It s a fast and enjoyable B movie  though   61  Foreshadowing X Men  First Class  Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said   Last stand  My ass  Billed as the climax of a trilogy  the third and weakest chapter in the X Men series is a blatant attempt to prove there is still life in the franchise  And there is  just enough to pull a Star Trek and spawn a Next Generation saga   62  Matthew Vaughn  who was attached as director before dropping out  criticized Ratner s direction   I could have done something with far more emotion and heart  I m probably going to be told off for saying that  but I genuinely believe it   19  Vaughn would later say that   I storyboarded the whole bloody film  did the script  My X3 would have been 40 minutes longer  They didn t let the emotions and the drama play in that film  It became wall to wall noise and drama  I would have let it breathe and far more dramatic elements to it   63   edit  Box office X Men  The Last Stand was released in the United States on May 26  2006 in 3 690 theaters  earning  102 750 665 in its opening weekend  64  which was a new Memorial day weekend record  65  The film s release was also a new

 edit  Accolades At the 2007 Saturn Awards  Famke Janssen won the Best Supporting Actress award for her portrayal of Jean Grey  73  Also impressed with Janssen s performance were Total Film  who said   playing the super freaky mind control goddess like GoldenEye s Xenia Onatopp s all powerful psycho sister  her scenes   particularly that one with the house   crackle with energy and tragedy  If only the rest of X3 had followed suit   74 Halle Berry received a People s Choice Award for  Favorite Female Action Star  for her role as Storm  During her acceptance speech  she asked all fans who wanted to see an  X Men 4  to write letters to producer Tom Rothman asking for another movie  75   edit  Home media The film was released on October 3  2006 in single disc DVD format  76  as well as a two
