formed in 1915 by the theater chain pioneer William Fox  who formed Fox Film Corporation by merging two companies he had established in 1913  Greater New York Film Rental  a distribution firm  which was part of the Independents  and Fox  or Box  depending on the source  Office Attractions Company  a production company  This merging of a distribution company and a production company was an early example of vertical integration  Only a year before  the latter company had distributed Winsor McCay s groundbreaking cartoon Gertie the Dinosaur  Always more of an entrepreneur than a showman  Fox concentrated on acquiring and building theaters  pictures were secondary  The company s first film studios were set up in Fort Lee  New Jersey where it and many other early film studios in America s first motion picture industry were based at the beginning of the 20th century  2  3  4  In 1917  William Fox sent Sol M  Wurtzel to Hollywood to oversee the studio s West Coast production facilities where a more hospitable and cost effective climate existed for filmmaking  Fox had purchased the Edendale studio of the failing Selig Polyscope Company  which had been making films in Los Angeles since 1909 and was the first motion picture studio in Los Angeles  With the introduction of sound technologies  Fox moved to acquire the rights to a sound on film process  In the years 1925 26  Fox purchased the rights to the work of Freeman Harrison Owens  the U S  rights to the Tri Ergon system invented by three German inventors  and the work of Theodore Case  This resulted in the Movietone sound system later known as  Fox Movietone   Later that year  the company began offering films with a music and effects track  and the following year Fox began the weekly Fox Movietone News feature  which ran until 1963  The growing company needed space  and in 1926 Fox acquired 300 acres  1 2 km2  in the open country west of Beverly Hills and built  Movietone City   the best equipped studio of its time  When rival Marcus Loew died in 1927  Fox offered to buy the Loew family s holdings  Loew s Inc  controlled more than 200 theaters  as well as the MGM studio  whose films are currently distributed internationally by Fox   When the family agreed to the sale  the merger of Fox and Loew s Inc  was announced in 1929  But MGM studio boss Louis B  Mayer  not included in the deal  fought back  Using political connections  Mayer called on the Justice Department s anti trust unit to block the merger despite that MGM itself coupled with Loews Theatres was considered being in violation of anti trust rules  Fortunately for Mayer  Fox was badly injured in a car crash in the summer of 1929  and by the time he recovered he had lost most of his fortune in the fall  1929 stock market crash  putting an end to the Loew s merger  Overextended and close to bankruptcy  Fox was stripped of his empire and ended up in jail  Fox Film  with more than 500 theatres  was placed in receivership  A bank mandated reorganization propped the company up for a time  but it was clear a merger was the only way Fox Film could survive  Under the new president Sidney Kent  the new owners began negotiating with the upstart but powerful independent Twentieth Century Pictures in the early spring of 1935   edit  Twentieth Century Pictures Twentieth Century Pictures was an independent Hollywood motion picture production company created in 1933 by Joseph Schenck  the former president of United Artists   Darryl F  Zanuck from Warner Brothers  William Goetz from Fox Films  and Raymond Griffith  Financial backing came from Schenck s younger brother Nicholas Schenck and the father in law of Goetz  Louis B  Mayer  the head of MGM Studios  Company product was distributed by United Artists  UA   and was filmed at various studios  Schenck was President of 20th Century while Zanuck was named Vice President in Charge of Production and Goetz served as vice president  Successful from the very beginning  their 1934 production  The House of Rothschild was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture  In 1935  they produced the classic film Les Mis rables  from Victor Hugo s novel  which was also nominated for Best Picture  Legend has it that the new independent took a detour straight into the major studio camp when Zanuck became outraged by United Artists  board including UA s co founder Mary Pickford s refusal to reward Twentieth Century with UA stock  fearing it would have diluted the value of holdings by another UA stockholder and co founder  D W  Griffith  Schenck  who had been a UA stockholder for over ten years  resigned from United Artists in protest of the shoddy treatment of Twentieth Century  and Zanuck began discussions with other distributors  which led to talks with the foundering giant  Fox  For a list of films produced by Twentieth Century Pictures  see List of 20th Century Pictures films   edit  Twentieth Century Fox merger Joe Schenck and Fox management agreed to a merger  Spyros Skouras  then manager of the Fox West Coast theaters  helped in the merger  and later became president of the new company   Although it was still much smaller than Fox  Twentieth Century was the senior partner in the merger  At first  it was expected that the new company would be called  Fox Twentieth Century   However  20th Century brought more to the bargaining table besides Schenck and Zanuck  as it was profitable and had more talent than Fox  The new company was called The Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation  and began trading on May 31  1935  the hyphen was dropped in 1985  Schenck became Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  while Kent remained as President  Zanuck became Vice President in Charge of Production  replacing Fox s longtime production chief Winfield Sheehan  For many years  20th Century Fox claimed to have been founded in 1915  the year Fox Film Corporation was founded  However  in recent years it has claimed the 1935 merger as its founding date  even though most film historians agree it was founded in 1915  Aside from the theater chain and a first rate studio lot  Zanuck and Schenck felt there wasn t much else to Fox  The studio s biggest star  Will Rogers  died in a plane crash weeks after the merger  Its leading female star  Janet Gaynor  was fading in popularity  Promising leading men James Dunn and Spencer Tracy had been dropped because of heavy drinking  Zanuck quickly signed young actors who would carry Twentieth Century Fox for years  Tyrone Power  Linda Darnell  Carmen Miranda  Don Ameche  Henry Fonda  Gene Tierney  Sonja Henie  and Betty Grable  Also on the Fox payroll he found two players who he built up into the studio s leading assets  Alice Faye and seven year old Shirley Temple  Favoring popular biographies and musicals  Zanuck built Fox back to profitability  Thanks to record attendance during World War II  Fox overtook RKO and mighty MGM to become the third most profitable studio  While Zanuck went off for eighteen months  war service  junior partner William Goetz kept profits high by emphasizing light entertainment  The studio s indeed the industry s biggest star was creamy blonde Betty Grable  In 1942 Spyros Skouras succeeded Schenck as president of the studio  Together with Zanuck  who returned in 1943  they intended to make Fox s output more serious minded  During the next few years  with pictures like The Razor s Edge  Wilson  Gentleman s Agreement  The Snake Pit  Boomerang  and Pinky  Zanuck established a reputation for provocative  adult films  Fox also specialized in adaptations of best selling books such as Ben Ames Williams  Leave Her to Heaven  1945   starring Gene Tierney  which was the highest grossing Fox film of the 1940s  Fox also produced Broadway musicals  including the Rodgers and Hammerstein films  beginning with the musical version of State Fair in 1945  and continuing years later with Carousel in 1956  The King and I  and The Sound of Music  They also distributed  but did not make  the CinemaScope version of Oklahoma  and the 1958 film version of South Pacific  After the war and with the advent of television audiences drifted away  Twentieth Century Fox held on to its theaters until a court mandated divorce  they were spun off as Fox National Theaters in 1953  That year  with attendance at half the 1946 level  Twentieth Century Fox gambled on an unproven gimmick  Noting that the two film sensations of 1952 had been Cinerama  which required three projectors to fill a giant curved screen  and  Natural Vision  3D  which got its effects of depth by requiring the use of polarized glasses  Fox mortgaged its studio to buy rights to a French anamorphic projection system which gave a slight illusion of depth without glasses  President Spyros Skouras struck a deal with the inventor Henri Chr tien  leaving the other filmstudios empty handed  and in 1953 introduced CinemaScope in the studio s ground breaking feature film The Robe  The success of The Robe was so massive that in February 1953 Zanuck announced that henceforth all Fox pictures would be made in CinemaScope  To convince theater owners to install this new process  Fox agreed to help pay conversion costs  about  25 000 per screen   and to ensure enough product  Fox gave access to CinemaScope to any rival studio choosing to use it  Seeing the box office for the first two CinemaScope features  The Robe and How to Marry a Millionaire  Warner Bros   MGM  Universal Pictures  then known as Universal International   Columbia Pictures and Disney quickly adopted the process  In 1956 Fox engaged Robert Lippert to establish a subsidiary company  Regal Pictures  later Associated Producers Incorporated to film B pictures in CinemaScope  CinemaScope brought a brief up turn in attendance  but by 1956 the numbers again began to slide  That year Darryl Zanuck announced his resignation as head of production  Officially attributed to burn out  rumors persisted that his wife had threatened divorce  in community property California  after discovering Zanuck s affair with actress Bella Darvi  Zanuck moved to Paris  setting up as an independent producer  he did not set foot in California again for twenty years   edit  Production and financial problems Zanuck s successor  producer Buddy Adler  died a year later  President Spyros Skouras brought in a series of production executives  but none had Zanuck s success  By the early 1960s Fox was in trouble  A remake of Theda Bara s Cleopatra had begun in 1959 with Joan Collins in the lead  As a publicity gimmick  producer Walter Wanger offered one million dollars to Elizabeth Taylor if she would star  she accepted  and costs for Cleopatra began to escalate  aggravated by Richard Burton s on set romance with Taylor and the surrounding media frenzy  Meanwhile  another remake   of the 1940 Cary Grant hit My Favorite Wife   was rushed into production in an attempt to turn over a quick profit to help keep Fox afloat  The romantic comedy entitled Something s Got to Give paired Marilyn Monroe  Fox s most bankable star of the 1950s  with Dean Martin  and director  George Cukor   The troubled Monroe caused delays on a daily basis  and it quickly descended into a costly debacle  As Cleopatra s budget passed the ten million dollar mark  settling somewhere around  40 million  Fox sold its back lot  now the site of Century City  to Alcoa in 1961 to raise cash  After several weeks of script rewrites on the Monroe picture and very little progress  mostly due to the director George Cukor s slow and repetitive filming  in addition to Monroe s chronic sinusitus  Marilyn Monroe was fired from Something s Got to Give and two months later she was found dead  although controversially to this day  According to Fox files she was rehired within weeks for a two picture deal totaling one million dollars   500K to finish Something s Got To Give  plus a bonus at completion  and  500K for What a Way to Go  Elizabeth Taylor s highly disruptive reign on the Cleopatra set continued unchallenged fron 1960 into 1962  though three Fox executives went to Rome in June 1962 to fire her  They learned that director Joseph L  Mankiewicz had filmed out of sequence and had only done interiors  so Fox was then forced to allow Taylor several more weeks of filming  In the meantime that summer of  62  Fox released nearly all of its contract stars  including Jayne Mansfield  With few pictures on the schedule  Skouras wanted to rush Zanuck s big budget war epic The Longest Day  a highly accurate account of the Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6  1944  with a huge international cast  into release as another source of quick cash  This offended Zanuck  still Fox s largest shareholder  for whom The Longest Day was a labor of love that he had dearly wanted to produce for years  After it became clear that Something s Got to Give would not be able to progress without Monroe in the lead  Martin had refused to work with anyone else   Skouras finally decided that something had to give and re signed her  But days before filming was due to resume  she was found dead at her Los Angeles home and the unfinished scenes from Something s Got to Give were shelved for nearly 40 years  Rather than being rushed into release as if it were a B picture  The Longest Day was lovingly and carefully produced under Zanuck s supervision  It was finally released at a length of three hours  and went on to be recognized as one of the great World War II films  At the next board meeting  Zanuck spoke for eight hours  convincing directors that Skouras was mismanaging the company and that he was the only possible successor  Zanuck was installed as chairman  and then named his son Richard Zanuck as president  This new management group seized Cleopatra and rushed it to completion  shut down the studio  laid off the entire staff to save money  axed the long running Movietone Newsreel and made a series of cheap  popular pictures that restored Fox as a major studio  The biggest boost to the studio s fortunes came from the tremendous success of The Sound of Music  1965   an expensive and handsomely produced adaptation of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway musical  which became one of the all time greatest box office hits  Fox also had two big science fiction hits in the 1960s  Fantastic Voyage  which introduced Racquel Welch to film audiences  in 1966  and the original Planet of the Apes  starring Charlton Heston  in 1968  Zanuck stayed on as chairman until 1971 but there were several expensive flops in his last years  resulting in Fox posting losses from 1969 to 1971  Following his removal  and after an uncertain period  new management brought Fox back to health  Under president Dennis Carothers Stanfill and production head Alan Ladd  Jr   Fox films connected with modern audiences  Stanfill used the profits to acquire resort properties  soft drink bottlers  Australian theaters  and other properties in an attempt to diversify enough to offset the boom or bust cycle of picture making  In 1977 Fox s success reached new heights and produced the most profitable film made up to that time  Star Wars  5   edit  Rupert Murdoch Main article  Rupert Murdoch Fox Plaza  Century City headquarters  completed in 1987 With financial stability came new owners  and in 1978 control passed to the investors Marc Rich and Marvin Davis  Fox s assets included Pebble Beach Golf Links  the Aspen Skiing Company  and a Century City property upon which Davis built and twice sold Fox Plaza  By 1985 Rich was a fugitive from US justice  and Davis bought out his interest in Fox for  116 million   6  Davis sold this interest to Rupert Murdoch for  250 million in March 1984  Davis later backed out of a deal with Murdoch to purchase John Kluge s Metromedia television stations   6  Murdoch went alone and bought the studios  and later bought out Davis remaining stake in Fox for  325 million   6  To gain FCC approval of Fox s purchase of Metromedia s television holdings  once the stations of the old DuMont network  Murdoch had to become a US citizen  He did so in 1985  the same year 20th Century Fox dropped the hyphen from its name   and in 1986 the new Fox Broadcasting Company took to the air  Over the next 20 odd years the network and owned stations group expanded to become extremely profitable for News Corp  Since January 2000 this company has been the international distributor for MGM UA releases  In the 1980s Fox  through a joint venture with CBS  called CBS Fox Video had distributed certain UA films on video  thus UA has come full circle by switching to Fox for video distribution  Fox also makes money distributing films for small independent film companies  In 2008 Fox announced an Asian subsidiary  Fox STAR Studios  a joint venture with STAR TV  also owned by News Corporation  It was reported that Fox STAR would start by producing films for the Bollywood market  then expand to several Asian markets  7  See also  List of 20th Century Fox films  edit  Television Main articles  20th Century Fox Television  20th

features were released to television in the hope that they would broaden sponsorship and help distribution of network programs  Blocks of one hour programming of feature films to national sponsors on 128 stations was organized by Twentieth Century Fox and National Telefilm Associates  Twentieth Century Fox received 50 percent interest in NTA Film network after it sold its library to National Telefilm Associates  This gave 90 minutes of cleared time a week and syndicated feature films to 110 non interconnected stations for sale to national sponsors  8   edit  Music Main article  20th

interest a specific audience  Please relocate any relevant information  and remove excessive detail that may be against Wikipedia inclusion policy   February 2012  20th Century Fox logo used from 1953 to 1987 created for the new CinemaScope process with the slanted  0  The Art Deco 20th Century Fox logo  designed by landscape artist Emil Kosa  Jr   originated as the 20th Century Pictures logo  with the name  Fox  substituted for  Pictures  Inc   in 1935  The logo was originally created as a painting on several layers of glass and animated frame by frame  Over the years the logo was modified several times  9  20th Century Fox CGI logo used from 1994 to 2010  still used on 20th Century Fox websites  In 1953  Rocky Longo  an artist at Pacific Title  was hired to recreate the original design for the new CinemaScope process  In order to give the design the required  width   Longo tilted the  0  in 20th  In 1981  after Longo repainted the eight layered glass panels  and straightened the  0    his revised logo became the official trademark   The 1953 logo  however  would be used in tandem with the newer logo until 1987   In 1994  after a few failed attempts  which even included trying to film the familiar monument as an actual three dimensional model   Fox in house television producer Kevin Burns was hired to produce new logo for the company   this time using the new process of computer generated imagery  CGI   With the help of graphics producer Steve Soffer and his company Studio Productions  which had recently given face lifts to the Paramount and Universal logos   Burns directed that the new logo contain more detail and animation  so that the longer  21 second  Fox fanfare with the  CinemaScope extension  could be used as the underscore  This required a virtual Los Angeles Cityscape to be designed around the monument  In the background can be seen the Hollywood sign  which would give the monument an actual location  approximating Fox s actual address in Century City   One final touch was the addition of store front signs each one bearing the name of Fox executives who were at the studio at the time  One of the signs reads   Murdoch s Department Store   another says  Chernin s  and a third reads   Burns Tri City Alarm   an homage to Burns  late father who owned a burglar and fire alarm company in Upstate New York   The 1994 CGI logo was also the first time that Twentieth Century Fox was recognized as  A News Corporation Company  in the logo  In 2009  a newly updated CGI logo  done by Blue Sky Studios  debuted in the film Avatar  A 75th Anniversary version of this new logo was used to coincide with 20th Century Fox s 75th anniversary  it made its official debut with Percy Jackson  amp  the Olympians  The Lightning Thief  and last appeared in Gulliver s Travels  10  The Fox fanfare was originally composed in 1933 by Alfred Newman  who became head of Twentieth Century Fox s music department from 1940 until the 1960s  It was re recorded in 1935 when 20th Century Fox was officially established  In 1953 an extended version was created for CinemaScope films  first used on the film How to Marry a Millionaire  released in the same year  The Robe  the first film released in CinemaScope  used the sound of a choir singing over the logo  instead of the regular fanfare  As television grew as a medium  the practice of placing production logos at the end of programs became commonplace  For Fox s television arm  a truncated version of the Newman fanfare has been used with a brief shot of the Fox logo  Syndicated programs would overlay  Television  over  Century  in an animation  resulting in the logo reading  20th Television Fox   Today  CGI logos are used  with 20th Century Fox Television primarily for Fox network programming  and 20th Television for other programming  such as cable and syndication   By the 1970s the Fox fanfare was only being used sporadically in films  George Lucas enjoyed the Alfred Newman music so much that he insisted it be used for Star Wars  1977   which features the CinemaScope version  Composer John Williams composed the Star Wars main theme in the same key  B  major  as the Fox fanfare as an extension to Newman s score  In 1980 Williams conducted a new version of the fanfare for The Empire Strikes Back  Williams  recording of the Fox fanfare has been used in every Star Wars film since  Since the introduction of the CGI Fox logo  Star Wars theatrical releases  beginning with the Special Editions of the original trilogy in 1997  have used a static angle version of the new logo  to allow for the animated Lucasfilm logo to appear during the extension  The Fox fanfare was re orchestrated in 1981  as Longo s revised logo was being introduced  As the CGI logo was being prepared to premiere at the beginning of James Cameron s True Lies  1994   Burns asked composer Bruce Broughton for a new version of the familiar fanfare  In 1997 Alfred s son  composer David Newman  recorded the new version of the fanfare in Anastasia  1997   This rendition is still in use as of 2010 update   Parodies of the fanfare have appeared at the start of the films The Cannonball Run  cars drive around the logo and knock out the searchlights   White Men Can t Jump  rap version of the fanfare   The Day After Tomorrow  thunderstorm on the set   Live Free or Die Hard  where the searchlights go out as a result of a power outage   The Rocky Horror Picture Show  featuring a piano rock version of the fanfare   The Simpsons Movie  Ralph Wiggum  sings along  with the fanfare  in trailers and commercials  the  0  in the tower is replaced by a pink  half bitten doughnut of the type Homer eats   Daredevil  the picture morphs into a negative image of the logo   as if perceived by the main character s radar sense   Ice Age  Dawn of the Dinosaurs  with snow and volcanoes covering the logo  but the regular 20th Century Fox logo was shown on the film s DVD and Blu rays release instead  and Minority Report  where the logo  alongside its DreamWorks counterpart  appears immersed in water  similar to the film s  precog  characters   A variant appears on most of the 2010 films  in which a 75 forms from lights  in recognition of the 75th anniversary of the merger  The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  the logo will become dark   In the X Men films of the 2000s  the  X  in  Fox  remains ghosted on the screen as the scene fades out  In Moulin Rouge  the logo appears on a stage behind a red curtain with a conductor directing an orchestra playing the fanfare  In the 2003 production of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen the logo appears as a huge unlit monument dominating the nighttime London skyline  In Diary of a Wimpy Kid  the studio placed a cartoon version of the 20th Century Fox structure on the main studio logo  20th Century Fox fanfare The fanfare from 1983 film Star Wars Episode VI  Return of the Jedi  conducted by John Williams  Problems listening to this file  See media help  At the end of Fox s Futurama  set in the 30th and 31st centuries  the logo is shown with the words  30th Century Fox   As a surprise twist  the opening fanfare for Alien3 has the music freeze on the penultimate melody tone  and then adds wailing French horns and bending strings  before continuing with a crash into the opening titles  thus setting the dark mood for the film  Also on The Simpsons  Season 10 DVD  each disc s opening shows Bart Simpson running around the logo while being chased by the squeaky voiced teenager  Fox Searchlight Pictures  Foxstar Productions  and Fox Studios Australia are just a few of the other corporate entities that have used variations on the original 1933 design   edit  See also List of 20th Century Fox films Related
