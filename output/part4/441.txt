is horseback riding with his Boy Scout troop in Utah  He discovers robbers in a cave who find an ornamental cross which belonged to Coronado and steals the cross from them  As they give chase  Indiana hides in a circus train  Although he escapes  the robbers bring the sheriff  and Indiana is forced to return it  Meanwhile  his oblivious father  Henry Jones  Sr   is working on his research into the Holy Grail  keeping meticulous notes in a diary  One of the robbers  dressed very similarly to the future Indiana and impressed by the young man s tenacity  gives him his fedora and some encouraging words  In 1938  after recovering the cross and donating it to Marcus Brody s museum  Indiana is introduced to Walter Donovan  who informs him that Indiana s estranged father has vanished while searching for the Holy Grail  using an incomplete inscription as his guide  Indiana then receives a package by post which turns out to be his father s Grail diary  containing his father s research  Understanding that his father would not have sent the diary unless he was in trouble  Indiana and Marcus travel to Venice  where they meet Henry s colleague  Dr  Elsa Schneider  Beneath the library where Henry was last seen  Indiana and Elsa discover catacombs and the tomb of a knight of the First Crusade  which also contains a complete version of the inscription that Henry had used  this one revealing the location of the Grail  They flee when the catacombs are set aflame by The Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword  a secret society that protects the Grail  Indiana and Elsa are pursued and escape on a speedboat  and a chase through Venice ensues in which they capture the secret society s leader  Kazim  After Indiana convinces him of their legitimate intentions  Kazim explains that The Brotherhood are protecting the Grail from those with evil intentions  and that Henry was abducted to Brunwald Castle on the Austrian German border  Indiana infiltrates the castle and finds his father  but learns that Elsa and Donovan are working with the Nazis  hoping that Indiana would discover the location of the Grail for them  The Nazis capture Marcus  who had traveled to Hatay  Turkey with a map that Henry had drawn to show the route to the Grail s hiding place  The Joneses are able to escape and recover the diary from Elsa at a Nazi rally in Berlin while barely escaping possible arrest by Adolf Hitler  On a Zeppelin and later a plane they escape from Germany  They then meet Sallah in Hatay  where they learn of Marcus  abduction and that the Nazis are already moving to the Grail s location  With the help of The Brotherhood  the Joneses ambush the Nazi convoy and rescue Marcus  Donovan and Elsa continue on to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon  the location of the Grail  Indiana  Henry  Marcus  and Sallah catch up and find that the Nazis are unable to pass through traps set before the Grail  After the four are discovered  Donovan shoots Henry  mortally wounding him  and thus forces Indiana to circumvent the traps by using the information in his father s diary in order to use the healing power of the Grail to save his father  with Donovan and Elsa following  Indiana succeeds and finds himself in a room with the last Knight  kept alive for seven hundred years with the power of the Grail  which has been hidden among dozens of other cups  Elsa selects a gilded cup encrusted in jewels for Donovan  when Donovan drinks from it  he rapidly decays and crumbles into dust  Indiana  recognizing that the Grail would be that of a humble carpenter instead of a wealthy king  selects the plainest looking cup in the group  which turns out to be the correct vessel  He fills it with water and quickly takes it to his father  pouring the holy water onto his chest and giving it to him to drink  which instantly heals his gunshot wound  As they prepare to leave  the Knight warns them to not take the Grail past the great seal in the temple s floor  but Elsa disobeys  causing the temple to collapse  Elsa falls to her death into an abyss while attempting to recover the Grail  Indiana nearly suffers the same fate until his father tells him to let it go  The Joneses  Marcus  and Sallah narrowly escape the collapsing temple  while the Knight watches them with his mission accomplished  The four then ride out of the canyon  and into the sunset   edit  Cast See also

Lost Ark to Spielberg in 1977  1  After the mixed critical and public reaction to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom  Spielberg decided to complete the trilogy to fulfill his promise to Lucas and  to apologize for the second one   2  The pair had the intention of revitalizing the series by evoking the spirit and tone of Raiders of the Lost Ark  3  Throughout development and pre production of The Last Crusade  Spielberg admitted he was  consciously regressing  in making the film  4  Due to his commitment to The Last Crusade  the director had to drop out of directing Big and Rain Man  1  Chris Columbus s script featured the Monkey King in Africa Lucas initially suggested making the film  a haunted mansion movie   for which Romancing the Stone writer Diane Thomas wrote a script  Spielberg rejected the idea because of the similarity to Poltergeist  which he had co written and produced  4  Lucas first introduced the Holy Grail in an idea for the film s prologue  which was to be set in Scotland  He intended the Grail to have a pagan basis  with the rest of the film revolving around a separate Christian artifact in Africa  Spielberg did not care for the Grail idea  which he found too esoteric  5  even after Lucas suggested giving it healing powers and the ability to grant immortality  In September 1984 Lucas completed an eight page treatment titled Indiana Jones and the Monkey King  which he soon followed with an 11 page outline  The story saw Indiana battling a ghost in Scotland before finding the Fountain of Youth in Africa  6  Chris Columbus who had written the Spielberg produced Gremlins  The Goonies  and Young Sherlock Holmes was hired to write the script  His first draft  dated May 3  1985  changed the main plot device to a Garden of Immortal Peaches  It begins in 1937  with Indiana battling the murderous ghost of Baron Seamus Seagrove III in Scotland  Indiana travels to Mozambique to aid Dr  Clare Clarke  a Katharine Hepburn type  according to Lucas  who has found a 200 year old pygmy  The pygmy is kidnapped by the Nazis during a boat chase  and Indiana  Clare and Scraggy Brier an old friend of Indiana travel up the Zambesi river to rescue him  Indiana is killed in the climactic battle but is resurrected by the Monkey King  Other characters include a cannibalistic African tribe  Nazi Sergeant Gutterbuhg  who has a mechanical arm  Betsy  a stowaway student who is suicidally in love with Indiana  and a pirate leader named Kezure  described as a Toshir  Mifune type   who dies eating a peach because he is not pure of heart  The tank is three stories high and requires Indiana to ride a rhinoceros to commandeer it  6  Columbus s second draft  dated August 6  1985  removed Betsy and featured Dash   an expatriate bar owner working for the Nazis   and the Monkey King as villains  The Monkey King forces Indiana and Dash to play chess with real people and disintegrates each person who is captured  Indiana subsequently battles the undead  destroys the Monkey King s rod  and marries Clare  6 Location scouting commenced in Africa but Spielberg and Lucas abandoned Monkey King because of its negative depiction of African natives  7  and because the script was unrealistic  6  Spielberg acknowledged that it made him     feel very old  too old to direct it   5  Columbus s script was leaked onto the Internet in 1997  and many believed it was an early draft for the fourth film because it was mistakenly dated to 1995  8  Unsatisfied  Spielberg suggested introducing Indiana s father  Henry Jones  Sr  Lucas was dubious  believing the Grail should be the focus of the story  but Spielberg convinced him that the father son relationship would serve as a great metaphor in Indiana s search for the artifact  4  Spielberg hired Menno Meyjes  who had worked on Spielberg s The Color Purple and Empire of the Sun  to begin a new script on January 1  1986  Meyjes completed his script ten months later  It depicted Indiana searching for his father in Monts gur  where he meets a nun named Chantal  Indiana travels to Venice  takes the Orient Express to Istanbul  and continues by train to Petra  where he meets Sallah and reunites with his father  In the denouement  the Nazis touch the Grail and explode  when Henry touches it  he ascends a staircase into Heaven  Chantal chooses to stay on Earth and marries Indiana  In a revised draft dated two months later  Indiana finds his father in Krak des Chevaliers  the Nazi leader is a woman named Greta von Grimm  and Indiana battles a demon at the Grail site  which he defeats with a dagger inscribed with  God is King   The prologue in both drafts has Indiana in Mexico battling for possession of Montezuma s mask with a man who owns gorillas as pets  6  Indiana Jones  River Phoenix  finds the Cross of Coronado as a 13 year old Boy Scout  Spielberg suggested making Indiana a Boy Scout as both he and Harrison Ford were former Scouts  Spielberg suggested Innerspace writer Jeffrey Boam perform the next rewrite  Boam spent two weeks reworking the story with Lucas  6  Boam told Lucas that Indiana should find his father in the middle of the story   Given the fact that it s the third film in the series  you couldn t just end with them obtaining the object  That s how the first two films ended   he said   So I thought  let them lose the Grail  and let the father son relationship be the main point  It s an archaeological search for Indy s own identity and coming to accept his father is more what it s about  than the quest for the Grail    4  Boam said he felt there was not enough character development in the previous films  5  In Boam s first draft  dated September 1987  the film is set in 1939  The prologue has Indiana retrieving an Aztec relic for a professor in Mexico and features the circus train  The leader of the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword is Kemal  a Hatayan secret agent who allies with the Nazis because he wants the Grail for the glory of his country  He shoots Henry and dies drinking from the wrong chalice  Henry and Elsa  who is described as having dark hair  were searching for the Grail on behalf of the Chandler Foundation  The Grail Knight battles Indiana on horseback  while Vogel is crushed by a boulder when stealing the Grail  6  Boam s February 1988 rewrite utilized many of Connery s comic suggestions  It included the prologue that was eventually filmed  Lucas had to convince Spielberg to show Indiana as a boy because of the mixed response to Empire of the Sun  which was about a young boy  5  Spielberg who was later awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award had the idea of making Indiana a Boy Scout  1 Indiana s mother  named Margaret in this version  dismisses Indiana when he returns home with the Cross of Coronado  while his father is on a long distance call  Walter Chandler of the Chandler Foundation features  but is not the main villain  he plunges to his death in the tank  Elsa shoots Henry  then dies drinking from the wrong Grail  and Indiana rescues his father from falling into the chasm while grasping for the Grail  Vogel is beheaded by the traps guarding the Grail  while Kemal tries to blow up the temple during a comic fight in which gunpowder is repeatedly lit and extinguished  Leni Riefenstahl appears at the Nazi rally  6  Boam s revision the following month showed Henry causing the seagulls to strike the plane  Tom Stoppard rewrote the script by May 8  1988 under the pen name Barry Watson  6  He polished much of the dialogue  9  and created the  Panama Hat  character to link the segments of the prologue featuring the young and adult Indianas  Stoppard also renamed Kemal to Kazim and Chandler to Donovan  and made Donovan shoot Henry  6   edit  Filming The tank chase was filmed in Almer a  Spain Principal photography began on May 16  1988 in the Tabernas Desert in the Almer a province of Spain  Spielberg originally had planned the chase to be a short sequence shot over two days  but he drew up storyboards to make the scene an action packed centerpiece  3  Thinking he would not surpass the truck chase from Raiders of the Lost Ark  because the truck was much faster than the tank   he felt this sequence should be more story based and needed to show Indiana and Henry helping each other  He later said he had more fun storyboarding the sequence than filming it  10  The second unit had begun filming two weeks before  11  After approximately ten days the production moved to Bellas Artes to film the scenes set in the Sultan of Hatay s palace  Cabo de Gata N jar Natural Park was used for the road  tunnel and beach sequence in which birds strike the plane  The Spanish portion of the shoot wrapped on June 2  1988 in Guadix  Granada with filming of Brody s capture at  skenderun train station  11  The filmmakers built a mosque near the station for atmosphere  rather than adding it as a visual effect  10  Filming for the castle interiors took place from June 5 to 10  1988 at Elstree Studios  England  The fire was filmed last  On June 16  the Royal Horticultural Society was used for the airport interiors  Filming returned to Elstree the next day to capture the motorcycle escape  continuing at the studio for interior scenes until July 18  One day was spent at North Weald Airfield on June 29 to film Indiana leaving for Venice  11  Ford and Connery acted much of the Zeppelin table conversation without trousers on because of the overheated set  12  Spielberg  Marshall and Kennedy interrupted the shoot to make a plea to the Parliament of the United Kingdom to support the economically  depressed  British studios  July 20 22 was spent filming the temple interiors  The temple set  which took six weeks to build  was supported on 80 feet of hydraulics and ten gimbals for use during the earthquake scene  Resetting between takes took twenty minutes while the hydraulics were put to their starting positions and the cracks filled with plaster  The shot of the Grail falling to the temple floor causing the first crack to appear was attempted on the full size set  but proved too difficult  Instead  crews built a separate floor section that incorporated a pre scored crack sealed with plaster  It took several takes to throw the Grail from six feet onto the right part of the crack  10  July 25 26 was spent on night shoots at Stowe School  Stowe  Buckinghamshire for the Nazi rally  11  Filming resumed two days later at Elstree  where Spielberg swiftly filmed the library  Portuguese freighter  and catacombs sequences  11  The steamship fight in the 1938 portion of the prologue was filmed in three days on a sixty by forty feet deck built on gimbals at Elstree  A dozen dump tanks each holding three hundred imperial gallons  360 U S  gallons  3000 lb  of water were used in the scene  10  Henry s house was filmed at Mill Hill  London  Indiana and Kazim s fight in Venice in front of a ship s propeller was filmed in a water tank at Elstree  Spielberg used a long focus lens to make it appear the actors were closer to the propeller than they really were  11  Two days later  on August 4  another portion of the boat chase using Hacker Craft sport boats  was filmed at Tilbury Docks in Essex  11  The shot of the boats passing between two ships was achieved by first cabling the ships off so they would be safe  The ships were moved together while the boats passed between  close enough that one of the boats scraped the sides of the ships  An empty speedboat containing dummies was launched from a floating platform between the ships amid fire and smoke that helped obscure the platform  The stunt was performed twice because the boat landed too short of the camera in the first attempt  10  The following day  filming in England wrapped at the Royal Masonic School in Rickmansworth  which doubled for Indiana s college  as it had in Raiders of the Lost Ark   11  Al Khazneh was used for the entrance to the temple housing the Holy Grail Shooting in Venice took place on August 8  11  For scenes such as Indiana and Brody greeting Elsa  shots of the boat chase  and Kazim telling Indiana where his father is  10 Robert Watts gained control of the Grand Canal from 7 am to 1 pm  sealing off tourists for as long as possible  Cinematographer Douglas Slocombe positioned the camera to ensure no satellite dishes would be visible  11 San Barnaba di Venezia served as the exterior to the library  3  The next day  filming moved to the ancient city of Petra  Jordan  which stood in for the temple housing the Grail  The cast and crew became guests of King Hussein and Queen Noor  The main cast completed their scenes that week  after 63 days of filming  11  The second unit filmed part of the 1912 segment of the prologue from August 29 to September 3  The main unit began two days later with the circus train sequence at Alamosa  Colorado  They filmed at Pagosa Springs on September 7  and then at Cortez on September 10  From September 14 to 16  filming of Indiana falling into the train carriages took place in Los Angeles  The production then moved to Arches National Park in Utah to shoot more of the opening  A house near the park was used for the Jones family home  11  The production had intended to film at Mesa Verde National Park  but Native American representatives had religious objections to its use  10  When Spielberg and editor Michael Kahn viewed a rough cut of the film in late 1988  they felt it suffered from a lack of action  The motorcycle chase was shot during post production at Mount Tamalpais and Fairfax near Skywalker Ranch  The closing shot of Indiana  Henry  Sallah and Brody riding into the sunset was filmed in Texas in early 1989  11  13   edit  Design Mechanical effects supervisor George Gibbs said The Last Crusade was the most difficult film of his career  10  He visited a museum to negotiate renting a small French World War I tank  but decided he wanted to make one  11  The tank was based on the Tank Mark VIII  which was 36 feet and 28 tons  Gibbs built the tank over the framework of a 28 ton excavator and added seven ton tracks that were driven by two automatic hydraulic pumps  each connected to a Range Rover V8 engine  Gibbs built the tank from steel rather than aluminum or fiberglass because it would allow the realistically suspensionless vehicle to endure the rocky surfaces  Unlike its historical counterpart which had only the two side guns the tank had a turret and two guns on its sides  It took four months to build and was transported to Almer a on a Short Belfast plane and then a low loader truck  10  Composite photograph of the tank on location The tank broke down twice  The rotor arm in the distributor broke and a replacement had to be sourced from Madrid  Then two of the valves in the device used to cool the oil exploded  due to solder melting and mixing with the oil  It was very hot in the tank  despite the installation of ten fans  and the lack of suspension meant the driver was unable to stop shaking during filming breaks  10  The tank only moved at ten to twelve miles per hour  which Vic Armstrong said made it difficult to film Indiana riding a horse against the tank while making it appear faster  11  A smaller section of the tank s top made from aluminum and which used rubber tracks was used for close ups  It was built from a searchlight trailer  weighed eight tons  and was towed by a four wheel drive truck  It had safety nets on each end to prevent injury to those falling off  10  A quarter scale model by Gibbs was driven over a 50 foot  15 m  cliff on location  Industrial Light  amp  Magic created further shots of the tank s destruction with models and miniatures  14  Michael Lantieri  mechanical effects supervisor for the 1912 scenes  noted the difficulty in shooting the train sequence   You can t just stop a train   he said   If it misses its mark  it takes blocks and blocks to stop it and back up   Lantieri hid handles for the actors and stuntmen to grab onto when leaping from carriage to carriage  The carriage interiors shot at Universal Studios Hollywood were built on tubes that inflated and deflated to create a rocking motion  10  For the close up of the rhinoceros that strikes at  and misses  Indiana  a foam and fiberglass animatronic was made in London  When Spielberg decided he wanted it to move  the prop was sent to John Carl Buechler in Los Angeles  who resculpted it over three days to blink  snarl  snort and wiggle its ears  The giraffes were also created in London  Because steam locomotives are very loud  Lantieri s crew would respond to first assistant director David Tomblin s radioed directions by making the giraffes nod or shake their heads to his questions  which amused the crew  14  For the villains  cars  Lantieri selected a 1912 Ford Model A and a 1914 Saxon  fitting each with a Ford Pinto V6 engine  Sacks of dust were hung under the cars to create a dustier environment  10  Spielberg used doves for the seagulls that Henry scares into striking the German plane because the real gulls used in the first take did not fly  3  In December 1988  Lucasfilm ordered 1000 disease free gray rats for the catacombs scenes from the company that supplied the snakes and bugs for the previous films  Within five months  5000 rats had been bred for the sequence  3  1000 mechanical rats stood in for those that were set on fire  Several thousand snakes of five breeds including a boa constrictor were used for the train scene  in addition to rubber ones onto which Phoenix could fall  The snakes would slither from their crates  requiring the crew to dig through sawdust after filming to find and return them  Two lions were used  which became nervous because of the rocking motion and flickering lights  10  Costume designer Anthony Powell found it a challenge to create Connery s costume because the script required the character to wear the same clothes throughout  Powell thought about his own grandfather and incorporated tweed suits and fishing hats  Powell felt it necessary for Henry to wear glasses  but did not want to hide Connery s eyes  so chose rimless ones  He could not find any suitable  so he had them specially made  The Nazi costumes were genuine and were found in Eastern Europe by Powell s co designer Joanna Johnston  to whom he gave research pictures and drawings for reference  11  Gibbs used Swiss army training planes for the German planes  He built a device based on an internal combustion engine to simulate gunfire  which was safer and less expensive than firing blanks  14  Baking soda was applied to Connery to create Henry s bullet wound  Vinegar was applied to create the foaming effect as the water from the Grail washes it away  14  At least one reproduction Kubelwagen was used during filming despite the film being set two years prior to manufacture of said vehicles   edit  Effects Industrial Light  amp  Magic  ILM  built an eight foot foam model of the Zeppelin to complement shots of Ford and Connery climbing into the biplane  A biplane model with a two foot wingspan was used for the shot of the biplane detaching  Stop motion animation was used for the shot of the German fighter s wings breaking off as it crashes through the tunnel  The tunnel was a 210 feet model that occupied 14 of ILM s parking spaces for two months  It was built in eight foot sections  with hinges allowing each section to be opened to film through  Ford and Connery were filmed against bluescreen  the sequence required their car to have a dirty windscreen  but to make the integration easier this was removed and later composited into the shot  Dust and shadows were animated onto shots of the plane miniature to make it appear as if it disturbed rocks and dirt before it exploded  Several hundred tim birds were used in the background shots of the seagulls striking the other plane  for the closer shots  ILM dropped feather coated crosses onto the camera  These only looked convincing because the scene s quick cuts merely required shapes that suggested gulls  14  Indiana discovers a bridge hidden by forced perspective  Ford was filmed in front of a bluescreen for the scene  which was completed by a model of the bridge filmed against a matte painting Spielberg devised the three trials that guard the Grail  5  For the first  the blades under which Indiana ducks like a penitent man were a mix of practical and miniature blades created by Gibbs and ILM  For the second trial  in which Indiana spells  Iehovah  on stable stepping stones  it was intended to have a tarantula crawl up Indiana after he mistakenly steps on  J   This was filmed and deemed unsatisfactory  so ILM filmed a stuntman hanging through a hole that appears in the floor  30 feet above a cavern  As this was dark  it did not matter that the matte painting and models were rushed late in production  The third trial  the leap of faith that Indiana makes over an apparently impassable ravine after discovering a bridge hidden by forced perspective  was created with a model bridge and painted backgrounds  This was cheaper than building a full size set  A puppet of Ford was used to create a shadow on the 9 foot tall  2 7 m  by 13 foot wide  4 0 m  model because Ford had filmed the scene against bluescreen  which did not incorporate the shaft of light from the entrance  14  Spielberg wanted Donovan s death shown in one shot  so it would not look like an actor having makeup applied between takes  Inflatable pads were applied to Julian Glover s forehead and cheeks that made his eyes seem to recede during the character s initial decomposing  as well as a mechanical wig that grew his hair  The shot of Donovan s death was created over three months by morphing together three puppets of Donovan in separate stages of decay  a technique ILM mastered on Willow  1988   12  A fourth puppet was used for the decaying clothes  because the puppet s torso mechanics had been exposed  Complications arose because Allison Doody s double had not been filmed for the latter two elements of the scene  so the background and hair from the first shot had to be used throughout  with the other faces mapped over it  Donovan s skeleton was hung on wires like a marionette  it required several takes to film it crashing against the wall because not all the pieces released upon impact  14  Ben Burtt designed the sound effects  He recorded chickens for the sounds of the rats  11  and digitally manipulated the noise made by a Styrofoam cup for the castle fire  He rode in a biplane to record the sounds for the dogfight sequence  and visited the demolition of a wind turbine for the plane crashes  14  Burtt wanted an echoing gunshot for Donovan wounding Henry  so he fired a  357 Magnum in Skywalker Ranch s underground car park  just as Lucas drove in  11  A rubber balloon was used for the earthquake tremors at the temple  15 The Last Crusade was released in selected theaters in the 70 mm Full Field Sound format  which allowed sounds to not only move from side to side  but also from the front to the rear of the theater  14  Matte paintings of the Austrian castle and German airport were based on real buildings  the Austrian castle was a small West German castle that was made to look larger  Rain was created by filming granulated Borax soap against black at high speed  It was only lightly double exposed into the shots so it would not resemble snow  The lightning was animated  The airport used was at San Francisco s Treasure Island  which already had appropriate art deco architecture  ILM added a control tower  Nazi banners  vintage automobiles and a sign stating  Berlin Flughafen   The establishing shot of the Hatayan city at dusk was created by filming silhouetted cutouts that were backlit and obscured by smoke  Matte paintings were used for the sky and to give the appearance of fill light in the shadows and rim light on the edges of the buildings  14   edit  Themes A son s relationship with his estranged father is a common theme in Spielberg s films  including E T  the Extra Terrestrial and Hook  4  The Last Crusade s exploration of fathers and sons coupled with its use of religious imagery is comparable to two other 1989 films  Star Trek V  The Final Frontier and Field of Dreams  Writing for The New York Times  Caryn James felt the combination in these films reflected New Age concerns  where the worship of God was equated to searching for fathers  James felt that neither Indiana or his father is preoccupied with finding the Grail or defeating the evil Nazis  but that  rather  both seek professional respect for one another in their boys  own adventure  James contrasted the biblically epic destruction of the temple with the more effective and quiet conversation between the Joneses at the end of the film  James noted that Indiana s mother does not appear in the prologue  being portrayed as already having died before the events in the film began  16   edit  Cultural references The 1912 prologue refers to events in the lives of Indiana s creators  When Indiana cracks the bullwhip to defend himself against a lion  he accidentally lashes and scars his chin  Ford gained this scar in a car accident as a young man  3  Indiana taking his nickname from his pet Alaskan Malamute is a reference to the character being named after Lucas s dog  12  The train carriage Indiana enters is named  Doctor Fantasy s Magic Caboose   which was the name producer Frank Marshall used when performing magic tricks  Spielberg suggested the idea  Marshall came up with the false bottomed box through which Indiana escapes  17  and production designer Elliott Scott suggested the trick be done in a single  uninterrupted shot  10  Spielberg intended the shot of Henry with his umbrella after he causes the bird strike on the German plane to evoke Ryan s Daughter  12   edit  Release  edit  Marketing See also  Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  soundtrack  The teaser trailer for The Last Crusade debuted in November 1988 with Scrooged and The Naked Gun  18 Rob MacGregor wrote the tie in novelization that was released in June 1989  19  it sold enough copies to be included on the New York Times Best Seller list  20  MacGregor went on to write the first six Indiana Jones prequel novels during the 1990s  Following the film s release  Ford donated Indiana s fedora and jacket to the Smithsonian Institution s National Museum of American History  21  No toys were made to promote The Last Crusade  Indiana Jones  never happened on the toy level   said Larry Carlat  senior editor of the journal Children s Business  Rather  Lucasfilm promoted Indiana as a lifestyle symbol  selling tie in fedoras  shirts  jackets and watches  22 Two video games based on the film were released by LucasArts in 1989  Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  The Graphic Adventure and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  The Action Game  A third game was produced by Taito and released in 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System  Ryder Windham wrote another novelization  released in April 2008 by Scholastic  to coincide with the release of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull  2008   Hasbro released toys based on The Last Crusade in July 2008  23   edit  Box office Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was released in North America on May 24  1989 in 2 327 theaters  earning  29 355 021 in its opening weekend  24  This was the third highest opening weekend of 1989  behind Ghostbusters II and Batman  25  Its opening day gross of  11 181 429 was the first time a film had made over  10 million on its first day  It broke the record for the best six day performance  with almost  47 million

the film broke a record by selling a million admissions within two and a half weeks  21  The film eventually grossed  197 171 806 in North America and  277 million internationally  for a worldwide total of  474 171 806  At the time of its release  The Last Crusade was the 11th highest grossing film of all time  24  Despite competition from Batman  The Last Crusade became the highest grossing film worldwide in 1989  26  In North America  Batman took top position  25  Behind Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and Raiders  The Last Crusade is the third highest grossing Indiana Jones film in North America  though it is also behind Temple of Doom when adjusting for inflation  27   edit  Reviews The Last Crusade opened to mixed reviews  It was panned by Andrew Sarris in The New York Observer  David Denby in New York magazine  Stanley Kauffmann in The New Republic and Georgia Brown in The Village Voice  11 Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader called the film  soulless   28 The Washington Post reviewed the film twice  Hal Hinson s review on the day of the film s release was negative  describing it as  nearly all chases and dull exposition   Although he praised Ford and Connery  he felt the film s exploration of Indiana s character took away his mystery and that Spielberg should not have tried to mature his storytelling  29  Two days later  Desson Thomson published a positive review praising the film s adventure and action  as well as the thematic depth of the father son relationship  30 Joseph McBride of Variety observed the  Cartoonlike Nazi villains of Raiders have been replaced by more genuinely frightening Nazis led by Julian Glover and Michael Byrne   and found the moment where Indiana meets Hitler  chilling   31  In his biography of Spielberg  McBride added the film was less  racist  than its predecessors  4  Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said the film was  the wildest and wittiest Indy of them all   Richard Corliss of Time and David Ansen of Newsweek praised it  as did Vincent Canby of The New York Times  11   Though it seems to have the manner of some magically reconstituted B movie of an earlier era  The Last Crusade is an endearing original   Canby wrote  deeming the revelation Indiana had a father he was not proud of to be a  comic surprise   Canby believed that while the film did not match the previous two in its pacing  it still had  hilariously off the wall sequences  such as the circus train chase  He also said that Spielberg was maturing by focusing on the father son relationship  32  a call echoed by McBride in Variety  31 Roger Ebert praised the scene depicting Indiana as a Boy Scout with the Cross of Coronado  he compared it to the  style of illustration that appeared in the boys  adventure magazines of the 1940s   saying that Spielberg  must have been paging through his old issues of Boys  Life magazine    the feeling that you can stumble over astounding adventures just by going on a hike with your Scout troop  Spielberg lights the scene in the strong  basic colors of old pulp magazines   33 The Hollywood Reporter felt Connery and Ford deserved Academy Award nominations  11  The film was evaluated positively after its release  Internet reviewer James Berardinelli wrote that while the film did not reach the heights of Raiders of the Lost Ark  it   avoided  the lows of The Temple of Doom  A fitting end to the original trilogy  Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade captures some of the sense of fun that infused the first movie while using the addition of Sean Connery to up the comedic ante and provide a father son dynamic   34  Neil Smith of the BBC praised the action  but said the drama and comedy between the Joneses was more memorable  He noted   The emphasis on the Jones boys means Julian Glover s venal villain and Alison Doody s treacherous beauty are sidelined  while the climax  becomes  one booby trapped tomb too many   35  Based on 55 reviews listed by Rotten Tomatoes  89  of critics praised The Last Crusade  giving it an average score of 8 10  36 Metacritic calculated an average rating of 65 100  based on 14 reviews  37   edit  Impact Sean Connery received Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations for his performance The film won the Academy Award for Best Sound Editing  it had also received nominations for Best Original Score and Best Sound  Ben Burtt  Gary Summers  Shawn Murphy and Tony Dawe   but lost to The Little Mermaid and Glory respectively  38  Sean Connery received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor  39  Connery and the visual and sound effects teams were also nominated at the 43rd British Academy Film Awards  40 The Last Crusade won the 1990 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation  41  and was nominated for Best Motion Picture Drama at the Young Artist Awards  42  John Williams  score won a BMI Award  and was nominated for a Grammy Award  43  The prologue depicting Indiana in his youth inspired Lucas to create The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles television show  which featured Sean Patrick Flanery as the young adult Indiana and Corey Carrier as the 8 10 year old Indiana  13  The 13 year old incarnation played by Phoenix in the film was the focus of a Young Indiana Jones series of young adult novels that began in 1990  44  by the ninth novel  the series had become a tie in to the television show  45  German author Wolfgang Hohlbein revisited the 1912 prologue in one of his novels  in which Indiana encounters the lead grave robber whom Hohlbein christens Jake in 1943  46  The film s ending begins the 1995 comic series Indiana Jones and the Spear of Destiny  which moves forward to depict Indiana and his father searching for the Holy Lance in Ireland in 1945  47  Spielberg intended to have Connery cameo as Henry in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull  2008   but Connery turned it down as he had retired  48   edit  References Rinzler  J W   Laurent Bouzereau  2008   The
