fan art rather than stuff you ve just found  unless it s with approval from the artist   but either way you will add it like any other image  here  and then tag the page in the dropdown as  fan art   Then add it to the page you want  If it is fan art  I would not add it to the article pages  but instead to either your user page or the character galleries and noted as fan art  Does that help    M1shawhan 18 15  January 1  2011  UTC  Wolverine 2099 Edit Why does wolverine 2099 have 1 arm   tootyfrooty8  18 45  December 31  2010  UTC  I am not sure if this was ever explained  He seemed to hold a true grudge against the Hulks  so I assume it was something to do with them    M1shawhan 18 15  January 1  2011  UTC  It was not explained in the comics  at least  not yet       Nathan  Peteparker   Earth 1218   talk   contribs   email  21 56  January 3  2011  UTC  In Marvel is there any left handed characters  Edit I always notice majority of the world is right handed  I wondered  if Marvel automatically makes everyone right handed    Or are there any characters that Marvel did make left handed  One person  I particularly wonder is Emma Frost  I can t say much for the comics but I notice in the animated series she uses her left hand quite often for holding weapons or to attack  Is she left handed in the comics or it s never stated  Is there anyone who s highly known as lefty  05 49  January 2  2011  UTC   TWQEmmaFrost There may be a handful of conversations where a character has admitted to being left handed  but I haven t run across any of them since I began editing on the site about four years ago  I m sure it s come up somewhere  but don t remember any of the conversations off hand      Nathan  Peteparker   Earth 1218   talk   contribs   email  21 56  January 3  2011  UTC

universe  or earth 616  is going to be after the events of m day  considering most of everyones favorite mutants have been de powered is marvel going to come up with some fancy way to give them all back their powers or what  i know a lot of them died after being de powered so obviously theyre not coming back  anyway any answer i can get would be great  speculation or otherwise Whatpain 04 50  January 17  2011  UTC  Current issues of the X Comics  X Men  Legacy  Uncanny X Men  etc     are all following up with this  The main one to keep an eye on this answer would be Generation Hope Vol 1  As for a flat answer on what they are going to do  I wouldn t hold my breath just yet  There were a LOT of characters who s whereabouts and current power levels are unknown  It could be anybody s guess  You might also check out Avengers  The Children s Crusade Vol 1 for more info on what happened to the Scarlet Witch since she was the cause of it all    M1shawhan 23 57  January 17  2011  UTC  Kevin Masterson Edit Hi  yeah  I was wondering what was the book and issue where Steve Rogers gives the Thunderstrike Mace to Kevin Masterson  and does anyone have any pictures of him changing into Thunderstrike  Thanks  GreenLanternPrime 20 35  January 31  2011  UTC  Thunderstrike Vol 2 1 is where he gets the Mace  Don t readily have any of him transforming  but I might try and hunt the issue

Amrica  Steve Rogers  His main page cites  Captain   citation 32  but a lot of appearances are being listed as  Commander Steve Rogers   So  which is correct   canon  and should we be fixing the main page s title to read  Commander   or changing the listed appearances to  Captain   The Overlord 06 47  February 12  2011  UTC  Two Lokis Edit I have never read any of the comics series  but I know Norse Mythology kinda well  PLEASE explain  how does Loki Laufeyson differ from Loki Odinsson  Who is the Loki from Elder Edda   Laufey is not Loki s dad  but mom Thanks  Loki Laufeyson 16 32  February 12  2011  UTC  Definitely not going to say that the comic series matches the mythology exactly  in fact  I can guarantee that it does not   I would say you can either read up on Loki  Thor  amp  Odin  But you might want to check with some of the site s more  Thor knowledgeable  admins  amp  users  Here are some of their talk pages  Eetmi  Farlstendoiro or Thor2000  and you might want to

characters  Some power grids are wrong even with the proper sources due to erroneous false editing  For instance  Beyonder  Iron Fist  Rand   Gorgon  Shisido  all according to the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Hardcovers are  6 s for Fighting Skills but have  7 s listed on their pages  Ultrabasurero 03 18  February 16  2011  UTC  Thank you for bringing this to our attention  Due to the incorrect false editing problem  official power grids have been locked so that only Administrators can change them  though Fan Based power grids can still be added by any user  I can personally correct any power grid you let me know about other than the ones listed in the hardcovers  since I don t own all of those  yet   For corrections based on hardcover power grids  please leave a message for GrnMarvl14   I went ahead and asked him to look into the three you suggested here this time   Again  thanks for your help       Nathan  Peteparker   Earth 1218   talk   contribs   email  16 07

have had their own ongoing series over the years  I know about Wolverine  Dazzler  Cable   Deadpool   Cable  amp  Deadpool  too   X Man  amp  X 23  But have there been any others to get the honor  I only care about the ongoing ones not limited series and one shots  Secondly one thing that has baffled me for a while  How can so many comics have a publication date that is after the release date  I mean if it hasn t been published how can it be released  What s the go bro  Limitlessness 01 19  February 21  2011  UTC  Some that come to mind would be Gambit and Bishop Vol 1  Bishop the Last X Man Vol 1  All the rest were mainly limited series and there are a BUNCH of those  Best thing to do would be to go through the entire list of comics and see them all  Or check out the One Shots  amp  limited series and you can find them all  Second question is an easy  yet complicated answer  The  release date  we use is the day the comic  hits the shelves   The  publication date  is the date you read on the cover index  which Marvel completely stopped doing in 1999 and the publication date was then moved to be solely inside the comic on the index   The reason that it differs is that the issues were being sent to the direct market  comic book stores  or newsstands  Because neither one of these vendors want to try to sell  older  comics  this date was originally intended to have the vendors keep them UNTIL that date and then allow them to take them down  This way people going to buy the comics see the current dates and believes that it is more current  The dates are normally a 2 3 month period  It s a kind of misnomer though to call it  Publication Date  as you pointed out  but it is the general practice for most magazines as well as comics  Good questions and I hope I answered them for ya       M1shawhan 01 43  February 21  2011  UTC  Profile Picture Edit How do you change your profile picture  Symbiote Sucker 23 30  March 1  2011  UTC  Click on your name in the

little more accurate and less wordy such as  Alternate Future Ultimate Universe  or something along those lines  Thank you  Balfro 18 21  March 6  2011  UTC  A template called the Number to Name

 I also wanted to mention that we try to be very specific with the reality descriptions  since it s likely multiple realities can fall under very similar circumstances   Alternate Future Ultimate

email  16 37  March 9  2011  UTC  I understand  However the Cable Earth you mention is listed as  Future Ultimate Universe  which is even more vague  This is why I offered up  ALTERNATE Future Ultimate Universe  as an example  Regardless of what it is labeled I do believe that it should be at least labeled with the words  Ultimate Universe  added to it as the description could easily be mistaken for an alternate future for the mainstream continuity with it s current description  Balfro 17 44  March 9  2011  UTC  Uploading a photo Edit for some reason all the photos i ve tried to

Hyborian Age  I d link to our page on this  but it needs to be completely revamped as it has no info on it   I would think that the  reality  of the Hyborian Age would be the same reality for the

It s really equivalent to the Transformers animated movie that was put out in the 80s  when Marvel was publishing the Transformers comics   Both are licensed properties  so it s unlikely that the

the story order  it depends on what you are really looking at  I think you mean directly from the storyline and the list that would probably best suit you  and the one that you probably are looking at is the Marvel Universe Reading Order   This was created based on storyline order  and it is by no means complete   It is well maintained by a contributor just like yourself named  Ryangut and he could probably shed more light on it  If you are talking about another list  please put a link up to it here or let us know and we will try to get you the answers to whatever you need    M1shawhan 01 57

reconstructed it and has healed a giant hole in his chest  Not ALL of those who possess these powers can do that  though  But Iceman HAS been shown capable of doing so  It really just comes down to the individual  2  Yes  someone with intangibility CAN phase specific body organs out  in X Men Forever  Shadowcat became melded with one of Wolverine s claws due to her powers being screwed up  phasing the claw out of his body and into hers  No reason this couldn t be extended to other bodily organs  Vision used to slide his hand into opponents organs to disrupt them  If he could have solidified around them  there s no reason he couldn t have removed it   3  It really depends on the individual  I don t believe Aqueduct was ever seen doing that  but it might just be that he was never seen doing it  not that he couldn t  4  Cannonball originally always made a sound when blasting off and flying  but learned how to control and lessen the noise  I m not entirely certain on his

Marvel Universe  I remember that during the beginning of the classic  Streets of Poison  arc  what s his name the former Mechano Marauder chewed Cap out for objecting to his use of crystal methe when Cap himself owed his powers and abilities to a drug  If he knew because he worked for the Avengers was one thing  but if it was because Operation Rebirth had become declassified  this would make Cap

am new to this site  I want to read the Civil War story line  I was wondering if I would be lost trying to read it without being up to date in the stories of the heroes that are involved in it  I know their basic story lines  and  for some people  the details of their story early on  but not really anything recent  Also  is this the correct and complete story line   http   www amazon com Civil War

War was a good self contained story on its own  There were no major plot points carried out in other books  with the POSSIBLE exceptions of Civil War  The Return Vol 1 1 and Iron Man Captain America  Casualties of War  1  one of which explained the  return  of Captain Marvel  if you care  and the other did a much more detailed explanation of the philosophies behind Captain America and Iron Man s viewpoints  But neither is remotely necessary to understand the plot or events    GrnMarvl14 01 40  January 16  2012  UTC  Thor  dead  Edit Is Thor dead in the 616 universe  If so  how did he die

Before he came the new Juggernaut you said he was a Class 100 A Class100 means a character can lift 100 tons or more over their heads I have the latest official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 and it even says he s a Class100 Now your e saying he can lift 70 tons when he was a teenager he can only lift 40 tons When Colossus was only a teenager he was capable of knocking down the Juggernaut and if he was only liting 40 tons at that time he wouldn t be able to do that to Juggernaut Colossus is one of my favorite characters Next to the Hulk and never trully gets his just due So my freinds

special in some other publication  The story contained Thor  Loki and Thjalfi and their journey into Jotunheim and encounter with the Jotun Utgard Loki  This would have been published in the late 60 s or early 70 s  I appreciate any information anyone can provide  This site says that the tale was published in 1978 but that is far too late for the original I m looking for  Spence the Elder hey there   i can only confirm what the site says  i checked other sources  Utgard Loki s first appearance was in 1978  It is of course possible  that he went unnamed in the issue in question  in which case it might not appear in his appearances  But I can pretty much guarantee you that it couldn t have been before 1974  since I have recently gone thruogh all those issues again and the story doesn t ring a bell  Do you have any further info you might remember   edkaufman  talk  08 46  March 6  2012  UTC  whats my rank mean  Edit Spidermanfan1945 00 31  March 6  2012  UTC  when i checked my message wall

for a new reader Edit Hi  I ve never read any Marvel Comics and I feel this is really a good time to start  I d like to follow all the well known major stories  Spider Man  X Men  Thor  Iron Man  Hulk  Avengers as the whole      What would you recommend me to start reading so I can catch up with all the major events in these comics  Oh  and I don t care about the whole Ultimate storylines  I d like to get into the primary canon  Thanks  Arutha Arutha 21 08  March 12  2012  UTC  Well  Arutha  a good method might be to check out the new X men Vs Avengers story  see what characters interest you  and look for their respective titles  and start following  Sometimes following a big story can tell you about major characters  By the way  Don t get discouraged by past years of continuity if you get interested in an older character  just jump in  learn from now and gradually find out more about the character  whether using this database or reading older comics  Also  if you re interested in the past few major events  look around for trade paper backs or graphic novels docuimenting the event  like Civil War  and others  Anway I hope this advice helps  and isn t too confusing  enjoy the reading   and God Bless  Tony Yinsen 05 11  March 13  2012  UTC  Also  any Marvel title which has a  1 after its number like this one or this one are good jumping on points  The  1 means a major story arc has started and they are doing a fill in issue before they start the next arc  They are stand alone stories which are good for introducing new people  Artful Dodger 01 31  March 14  2012  UTC
