Notes  Bendis continued the tradition of modernizing mainstream characters when introducing them into the Ultimate Universe  For example  Dazzler debuted in 1980 as a disco star in the regular Marvel continuity  In Ultimate Marvel continuity  she is a punk rocker  Brian K  Vaughan believed  Ultimate Dazzler   may very well be Bendis  single greatest contribution to the free world   which led to
