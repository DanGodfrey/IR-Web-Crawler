and one of its indigenous religions  Hinduism includes Shaivism  Vaishnavism and  rauta among numerous other traditions  It also includes historical groups  for example the Kapalikas  Among other practices and philosophies  Hinduism includes a wide spectrum of laws and prescriptions of  daily morality  based on the notion of karma  dharma  and societal norms  5  Hinduism is a conglomeration of distinct intellectual or philosophical points of view  rather than a rigid common set of beliefs  6  Hinduism is formed of diverse traditions and has no single founder  7  Among its direct roots is

References 13 Further reading 14 External links Etymology Valmiki  a contemporary of Rama  composes the Ramayana  The word Hindu is derived from the Sanskrit word Sindhu   the historic local appellation for the Indus River in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent and is first mentioned in the Rig Veda  12  13  14  The word Hindu was first used by Arab invaders and then went further west by the Arabic term al Hind referring to the land of the people who live across river Indus  15  and the Persian term Hind  referring to all Indians  By the 13th century  Hindust n emerged as a popular alternative name of India  meaning the  land of Hindus   16  The term Hinduism also occurs sporadically in Sanskrit texts such as the later Rajataranginis of Kashmir  Hinduka  c  1450   some 16th 18th century Bengali Gaudiya Vaishnava texts  including Chaitanya Charitamrita and Chaitanya Bhagavata  usually to contrast Hindus with Yavanas or Mlecchas  17  It was only towards the end of the 18th century that the European merchants and colonists referred collectively to the followers of Indian religions as Hindus  The term Hinduism was introduced into the English language in the 19th century to denote the religious  philosophical  and cultural traditions native to India  History Main article  History of Hinduism Sacred Mount Kailash in Tibet is regarded as the spiritual abode of Lord Shiva  The so called Shiva Pashupati seal Navy shoulderboard for Hindu military chaplain  South African military The earliest evidence for prehistoric religion in India date back to the late Neolithic in the early Harappan period  5500 2600 BCE   18  19  The beliefs and practices of the pre classical era  1500 500 BCE  are called the  historical Vedic religion   The Vedic religion shows influence from Proto Indo European religion  20  21  22  23  The oldest Veda is the Rigveda  dated to 1700 1100 BCE  24  The Vedas center on worship of deities such as Indra  Varuna and Agni  and on the Soma ritual  Fire sacrifices  called yaj a were performed  and Vedic mantras chanted but no temples or idols are known  25  The major Sanskrit epics  Ramayana and Mahabharata  were compiled over a protracted period during the late centuries BCE and the early centuries CE  26  They contain mythological stories about the rulers and wars of ancient India  and are interspersed with religious and philosophical treatises  The later Puranas recount tales about devas and devis  their interactions with humans and their battles against rakshasa  The Brahmanical tradition was paralleled by the non Vedic Shramana movement  The Buddha was a member of this movement  27  Shramana also gave rise to Jainism 28   yoga 29   the concept of the cycle of birth and death  the concept of samsara  and the concept of liberation  30  The Brahmanical ashrama system of life was an attempt to institutionalize Shramana ideals within the Brahmanical social structure  31  The Shramana movement also influenced the Aranyakas and Upanishads in the Brahmanical tradition  32  Buddhism was promoted by Asoka the Great of the Mauryan Empire  who unified the Indian subcontinent in the 3rd century BCE  After 200 CE several schools of thought were formally codified in Indian philosophy  including Samkhya  Yoga  Nyaya  Vaisheshika  Purva Mimamsa and Vedanta  33 Charvaka  the founder of an atheistic materialist school  came to the fore in North India in the sixth century BCE  34  Sanskritic culture went into decline after the end of the Gupta period  The early medieval Puranas helped establish a religious mainstream among the pre literate tribal societies undergoing acculturation  The tenets of Brahmanic Hinduism and of the Dharmashastras underwent a radical transformation at the hands of the Purana composers  resulting in the rise of a mainstream  Hinduism  that overshadowed all earlier traditions  35  In eighth century royal circles  the Buddha started to be replaced by Hindu gods in pujas  36  This also was the same period of time the Buddha was made into an avatar of Vishnu  37  Though Islam came to India in the early 7th century with the advent of Arab traders and the conquest of Sindh  it started to become a major religion during the later Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent  34  During this period Buddhism declined rapidly and many Hindus were forcibly converted to Islam  38  39  40  Numerous Muslim rulers or their army generals such as Aurangzeb and Malik Kafur destroyed Hindu temples 41  42  43  and persecuted non Muslims  however some  such as Akbar  were more tolerant  Hinduism underwent profound changes  in large part due to the influence of the prominent teachers Ramanuja  Madhva  and Chaitanya  34  Followers of the Bhakti movement moved away from the abstract concept of Brahman  which the philosopher Adi Shankara consolidated a few centuries before  with emotional  passionate devotion towards the more accessible Avatars  especially Krishna and Rama  44  The oldest Vedic traditions exhibit strong similarities to the pre Zoroastrian Proto Indo Iranian religion and other Indo European religions  For example  the  gvedic deity Dyaus  regarded as the father of the other deities  is linguistically cognate with Zeus the king of the gods in Greek mythology  Iovis  gen  of Jupiter   the king of the gods in Roman mythology  and Tiu Ziu in Germanic mythology  Other Vedic deities also have cognates with those found in other Indo European speaking peoples  mythologies  see Proto Indo European religion and Comparison of Greek and Hindu Gods  45  Indology as an academic discipline of studying Indian culture from a European perspective was established in the 19th century  led by scholars such as Max M ller and John Woodroffe  They brought Vedic  Puranic and Tantric literature and philosophy to Europe and the United States  At the same time  societies such as the Brahmo Samaj and the Theosophical Society attempted to reconcile and fuse Abrahamic and Dharmic philosophies  endeavouring to institute societal reform  This period saw the emergence of movements which  while highly innovative  were rooted in indigenous tradition  They were based on the personalities and teachings of individuals  as with Ramakrishna and Ramana Maharshi  Prominent Hindu philosophers  including Aurobindo and Prabhupada  founder of ISKCON   translated  reformulated and presented Hinduism s foundational texts for contemporary audiences in new iterations  attracting followers and attention in India and abroad  Others such as Vivekananda  Paramahansa Yogananda  B K S  Iyengar and Swami Rama have also been instrumental in raising the profiles of Yoga and Vedanta in the West  Typology Main article  Hindu denominations The Swaminarayan Akshardham Temple in Delhi  according the Guinness World Records is the World s Largest Comprehensive Hindu Temple 46  Hinduism as it is commonly known can be subdivided into a number of major currents  Of the historical division into six darsanas  only two schools  Vedanta and Yoga  survive  The main divisions of Hinduism today are Vaishnavism  Shaivism  Smartism and Shaktism  47  Hinduism also recognizes numerous divine beings subordinate to the Supreme Being or regards them as lower manifestations of it  48  Other notable characteristics include a belief in reincarnation and karma  as well as in personal duty  or dharma  McDaniel  2007  distinguishes six generic  types  of Hinduism  in an attempt to accommodate a variety of views on a rather complex subject  49  Folk Hinduism  as based on local traditions and cults of local deities at a communal level and spanning back to prehistoric times or at least prior to written Vedas   rauta or  Vedic  Hinduism as practiced by traditionalist brahmins   rautins   Vedantic Hinduism  for example Advaita Vedanta  Smartism   as based on the philosophical approach of the Upanishads  Yogic Hinduism  especially that based on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali   Dharmic  Hinduism or  daily morality   based on the notion of Karma  and upon societal norms such as Viv ha  Hindu marriage customs   Bhakti or devotionalist practices Definitions The Triveni Sangam  or the intersection of Yamuna River  Ganges River and mythical Saraswati river  Hinduism does not have a  unified system of belief encoded in declaration of faith or a creed   50  but is rather an umbrella term comprising the plurality of religious phenomena originating and based on the Vedic traditions  51  52  53  54  The characteristic of comprehensive tolerance to differences in belief  and Hinduism s openness  makes it difficult to define as a religion according to traditional Western conceptions  55  To its adherents  Hinduism is the traditional way of life  56  and because of the wide range of traditions and ideas incorporated within or covered by it  arriving at a comprehensive definition of the term is problematic  50  While sometimes referred to as a religion  Hinduism is more often defined as a religious tradition  4  It is therefore described as both the oldest of the world s religions  and the most diverse  3  57  58  59  Most Hindu traditions revere a body of religious or sacred literature  the Vedas  although there are exceptions  Some Hindu religious traditions regard particular rituals as essential for salvation  but a variety of views on this co exist  Some Hindu philosophies postulate a theistic ontology of creation  of sustenance  and of destruction of the universe  yet some Hindus are atheists  Hinduism is sometimes characterized by the belief in reincarnation  samsara   determined by the law of karma  and the idea that salvation is freedom from this cycle of repeated birth and death  However  other religions of the region  such as Buddhism  Jainism and Sikhism  also believe in karma  outside the scope of Hinduism  50  Hinduism is therefore viewed as the most complex of all of the living  historical world religions  60  Despite its complexity  Hinduism is not only one of the numerically largest faiths  but is also the oldest living major tradition on earth  with roots reaching back into prehistory  61  A definition of Hinduism  given by the first Vice President of India  who was also a prominent theologian  Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan  states that Hinduism is not  just a faith   but in itself is related to the union of reason and intuition  Radhakrishnan explicitly states that Hinduism cannot be defined  but is only to be experienced  62  Similarly some academics suggest that Hinduism can be seen as a category with  fuzzy edges   rather than as a well defined and rigid entity  Some forms of religious expression are central to Hinduism  while others are not as central but still remain within the category  Based on this  Ferro Luzzi has developed a  Prototype Theory approach  to the definition of Hinduism  63  Problems with the single definition of what is actually meant by the term  Hinduism  are often attributed to the fact that Hinduism does not have a single or common historical founder  Hinduism  or as some say  Hinduisms   does not have a single system of salvation and has different goals according to each sect or denomination  The forms of Vedic religion are seen not as an alternative to Hinduism  but as its earliest form  and there is little justification for the divisions found in much western scholarly writing between Vedism  Brahmanism  and Hinduism  11  64  A definition of Hinduism is further complicated by the frequent use of the term  faith  as a synonym for  religion   50  Some academics 65  and many practitioners refer to Hinduism using a native definition  as San tana Dharma  a Sanskrit phrase meaning  the eternal law   or the  eternal way   66  67  Beliefs Temple carving at Hoysaleswara temple representing the Trimurti  Brahma  Shiva and Vishnu  Hinduism refers to a religious mainstream which evolved organically and spread over a large territory marked by significant ethnic and cultural diversity  This mainstream evolved both by innovation from within  and by assimilation of external traditions or cults into the Hindu fold  The result is an enormous variety of religious traditions  ranging from innumerable small  unsophisticated cults to major religious movements with millions of adherents spread over the entire subcontinent  The identification of Hinduism as an independent religion separate from Buddhism or Jainism consequently hinges on the affirmation of its adherents that it is such  68  Hinduism grants absolute and complete freedom of belief and worship  69  70  71  Hinduism conceives the whole world as a single family that deifies the one truth  and therefore it accepts all forms of beliefs and dismisses labels of distinct religions which would imply a division of identity  72  Hence  Hinduism is devoid of the concepts of apostasy  heresy and blasphemy  73  74  75  76  Prominent themes in Hindu beliefs include  but are not restricted to   Dharma  ethics duties   Sams ra  The continuing cycle of birth  life  death and rebirth   Karma  action and subsequent reaction   Moksha  liberation from samsara   and the various Yogas  paths or practices   77  Concept of God Main article  God in Hinduism Krishna displays his Vishvarupa  Universal Form  to Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra  Hinduism is a diverse system of thought with beliefs spanning monotheism  polytheism  panentheism  pantheism  monism  and atheism among others  78  79  80  81  and its concept of God is complex and depends upon each individual and the tradition and philosophy followed  It is sometimes referred to as henotheistic  i e   involving devotion to a single god while accepting the existence of others   but any such term is an overgeneralization  82  The Rig Veda  the oldest scripture and the mainstay of Hindu philosophy does not take a restrictive view on the fundamental question of God and the creation of universe  It rather lets the individual seek and discover answers in the quest of life  Nasadiya Sukta  Creation Hymn  of the Rig Veda thus says 83  84   Who really knows  Who will here proclaim it  Whence was it produced  Whence is this creation  The gods came afterwards  with the creation of this universe  Who then knows whence it has arisen  Most Hindus believe that the spirit or soul   the true  self  of every person  called the  tman   is eternal  85  According to the monistic pantheistic theologies of Hinduism  such as Advaita Vedanta school   this Atman is ultimately indistinct from Brahman  the supreme spirit  Hence  these schools are called non dualist  86  The goal of life  according to the Advaita school  is to realize that one s  tman is identical to Brahman  the supreme soul  87  The Upanishads state that whoever becomes fully aware of the  tman as the innermost core of one s own self realizes an identity with Brahman and thereby reaches moksha  liberation or freedom   85  88  The schools of Vedanta and Nyaya states that karma itself proves the existence of God   89  90  Nyaya being the school of logic  makes the  logical  inference that the universe is an effect and it ought to have a creator  91  Dualistic schools  see Dvaita and Bhakti  understand Brahman as a Supreme Being who possesses personality  and they worship him or her thus  as Vishnu  Brahma  Shiva  or Shakti  depending upon the sect  The  tman is dependent on God  while moksha depends on love towards God and on God s grace  92  When God is viewed as the supreme personal being  rather than as the infinite principle   God is called Ishvara   The Lord    93 Bhagavan   The Auspicious One  93   or Parameshwara   The Supreme Lord  93    86  However interpretations of Ishvara vary  ranging from non belief in Ishvara by followers of Mimamsakas  to identifying Brahman and Ishvara as one  as in Advaita  86  In the majority of traditions of Vaishnavism he is Vishnu  God  and the text of Vaishnava scriptures identify this Being as Krishna  sometimes referred to as svayam bhagavan  In Bhaagawada Gita  for example  God is the sole repository of Gunas  attributes  also  as 94  His hands and feet are everywhere  He looks everywhere and all around  His eyes  ears and face point to all directions  and all the three worlds are surrounded by these  Atheistic doctrines dominate Hindu schools like Samkhya and Mimamsa  95  The S  khyapravacana S tra of Samkhya argues that the existence of God  Ishvara  cannot be proved and hence cannot be admitted to exist  96  Samkhya argue that an unchanging God cannot be the source of an ever changing world  It says God was a necessary metaphysical assumption demanded by circumstances  97  Proponents of the school of Mimamsa  which is based on rituals and orthopraxy states that the evidence allegedly proving the existence of God was insufficient  They argue that there is no need to postulate a maker for the world  just as there is no need for an author to compose the Vedas or a God to validate the rituals  98  Mimamsa considers the Gods named in the Vedas have no existence apart from the mantras that speak their names  To that regard  the power of the mantras is what is seen as the power of Gods  99  Devas and avatars Detail of the Phra Prang  the central tower of the Wat Arun   Temple of Dawn   in Bangkok  Thailand   showing Indra on his three headed elephant Erawan  Airavata  Krishna  the eighth incarnation  Avatar  of Vishnu or svayam bhagavan  worshiped across a number of traditions The Hindu scriptures refer to celestial entities called Devas  or dev  in feminine form  devat  used synonymously for Deva in Hindi    the shining ones   which may be translated into English as  gods  or  heavenly beings   100  The devas are an integral part of Hindu culture and are depicted in art  architecture and through icons  and mythological stories about them are related in the scriptures  particularly in Indian epic poetry and the Puranas  They are  however  often distinguished from Ishvara  a supreme personal god  with many Hindus worshiping Ishvara in one of its particular manifestations  ostensibly separate deities  as their i  a devat   or chosen ideal  101  102  The choice is a matter of individual preference  103  and of regional and family traditions  103  Hindu epics and the Puranas relate several episodes of the descent of God to Earth in corporeal form to restore dharma to society and to guide humans to moksha  Such an incarnation is called an Avatar  The most prominent avatars are of Vishnu and include Rama  the protagonist in Ramayana  and Krishna  a central figure in the epic Mahabharata   Karma and samsara Main article  Karma in Hinduism Karma translates literally as action  work  or deed  104  and can be described as the  moral law of cause and effect   105  According to the Upanishads an individual  known as the jiva atma  develops sanskaras  impressions  from actions  whether physical or mental  The linga sharira  a body more subtle than the physical one but less subtle than the soul  retains impressions  carrying them over into the next life  establishing a unique trajectory for the individual  106  Thus  the concept of a universal  neutral  and never failing karma intrinsically relates to reincarnation as well as to one s personality  characteristics  and family  Karma binds together the notions of free will and destiny  This cycle of action  reaction  birth  death and rebirth is a continuum called samsara  The notion of reincarnation and karma is a strong premise in Hindu thought  The Bhagavad Gita states    As a person puts on new clothes and discards old and torn clothes  similarly an embodied soul enters new material bodies  leaving the old bodies  B G  2 22  107    Samsara provides ephemeral pleasures  which lead people to desire rebirth so as to enjoy the pleasures of a perishable body  However  escaping the world of samsara through moksha is believed to ensure lasting happiness and peace  108  109  It is thought that after several reincarnations  an atman eventually seeks unity with the cosmic spirit  Brahman Paramatman   The ultimate goal of life  referred to as moksha  nirvana or samadhi  is understood in several different ways  as the realization of one s union with God  as the realization of one s eternal relationship with God  realization of the unity of all existence  perfect unselfishness and knowledge of the Self  as the attainment of perfect mental peace  and as detachment from worldly desires  Such realization liberates one from samsara and ends the cycle of rebirth  110  111  Due to belief in the indestructibility of the soul  112  death is deemed insignificant with respect to the cosmic self  113  Thence  a person who has no desire or ambition left and no responsibilities remaining in life or one affected by a terminal disease may embrace death by Prayopavesa  114  The exact conceptualization of moksha differs among the various Hindu schools of thought  For example  Advaita Vedanta holds that after attaining moksha an atman no longer identifies itself with an individual but as identical with Brahman in all respects  The followers of Dvaita  dualistic  schools identify themselves as part of Brahman  and after attaining moksha expect to spend eternity in a loka  heaven   115  in the company of their chosen form of Ishvara  Thus  it is said that the followers of dvaita wish to  taste sugar   while the followers of Advaita wish to  become sugar   116  Objectives of human life From Ramayana Main article  Purusharthas See also  Initiation  Dharma  Artha  K ma  and Mok a Classical Hindu thought accepts the following objectives of human life  that which is sought as human purpose  aim  or end  is known as the puru  rthas  117  118  Dharma  righteousness  ethikos  The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad views dharma as the universal principle of law  order  harmony  all in all truth  that sprang first from Brahman  It acts as the regulatory moral principle of the Universe  It is sat  truth   a major tenet of Hinduism  This hearkens back to the conception of the Rig Veda that  Ekam Sat    Truth Is One   of the idea that Brahman is  Sacchidananda   Truth Consciousness Bliss   Dharma is not just law  or harmony  it is pure Reality  In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad s own words  Verily  that which is Dharma is truth  Therefore they say of a man who speaks truth   He speaks the Dharma   or of a man who speaks the Dharma   He speaks the Truth    Verily  both these things are the same    Brh  Upanishad  1 4 14   2  In the Mahabharata  Krishna defines dharma as upholding both this worldly and other worldly affairs   Mbh 12 110 11   The word San tana means  eternal    perennial   or  forever   thus   San tana Dharma  signifies that it is the dharma that has neither beginning nor end  119  Artha  livelihood  wealth  Artha is objective  amp  virtuous pursuit of wealth for livelihood  obligations and economic prosperity  It is inclusive of political life  diplomacy and material well being  The doctrine of Artha is called Arthashastra  amongst the most famous of which is Kautilya Arthashastra  120  121  122  K ma  sensual pleasure  K ma  Sanskrit  Pali  Devanagari       means desire  wish  passion  longing  pleasure of the senses  the aesthetic enjoyment of life  affection  or love  123  124  Mok a  liberation  freedom from samsara  Moksha  Sanskrit        mok a  or mukti  Sanskrit           literally  release   both from a root muc  to let loose  let go    is the last goal of life  It is liberation from samsara and the concomitant suffering involved in being subject to the cycle of repeated death and reincarnation  125  Yoga Main article  Yoga A statue of Shiva in yogic meditation  In whatever way a Hindu defines the goal of life  there are several methods  yogas  that sages have taught for reaching that goal  Texts dedicated to Yoga include the Bhagavad Gita  the Yoga Sutras  the Hatha Yoga Pradipika  and  as their philosophical and historical basis  the Upanishads  Paths that one can follow to achieve the spiritual goal of life  moksha  samadhi or nirvana  include  Bhakti Yoga  the path of love and devotion  Karma Yoga  the path of right action  R ja Yoga  the path of meditation  J  na Yoga  the path of wisdom  126  An individual may prefer one or some yogas over others  according to his or her inclination and understanding  Some devotional schools teach that bhakti is the only practical path to achieve spiritual perfection for most people  based on their belief that the world is currently in the Kali Yuga  one of four epochs which are part of the Yuga cycle   127  Practice of one yoga does not exclude others  Many schools believe that the different yogas naturally blend into and aid other yogas  For example  the practice of jnana yoga  is thought to inevitably lead to pure love  the goal of bhakti yoga   and vice versa  128  Someone practicing deep meditation  such as in raja yoga  must embody the core principles of karma yoga  jnana yoga and bhakti yoga  whether directly or indirectly  126  129  Practices Main articles  Puja  Hinduism   Yajna  Murti  Mandir  Hindu iconography  Japa  and Mantra See also  Initiation The sacred Tulsi plant in front of the house  Hindu practices generally involve seeking awareness of God and sometimes also seeking blessings from Devas  Therefore  Hinduism has developed numerous practices meant to help one think of divinity in the midst of everyday life  Hindus can engage in p j   worship or veneration   93  either at home or at a temple  At home  Hindus often create a shrine with icons dedicated to their chosen form s  of God  Temples are usually dedicated to a primary deity along with associated subordinate deities though some commemorate multiple deities  Visiting temples is not obligatory  130  and many visit temples only during religious festivals  Hindus perform their worship through icons  murtis   The icon serves as a tangible link between the worshiper and God  131  The image is often considered a manifestation of God  since God is immanent  The Padma Purana states that the m rti is not to be thought of as mere stone or wood but as a manifest form of the Divinity  132  A few Hindu sects  such as the  rya Sam j  do not believe in worshiping God through icons  Hinduism has a developed system of symbolism and iconography to represent the sacred in art  architecture  literature and worship  These symbols gain their meaning from the scriptures  mythology  or cultural traditions  The syllable Om  which represents the Parabrahman  and the Swastika sign  which symbolizes auspiciousness  have grown to represent Hinduism itself  while other markings such as tilaka identify a follower of the faith  Hinduism associates many symbols  which include the lotus  chakra and veena  with particular deities  Mantras are invocations  praise and prayers that through their meaning  sound  and chanting style help a devotee focus the mind on holy thoughts or express devotion to God the deities  Many devotees perform morning ablutions at the bank of a sacred river while chanting the Gayatri Mantra or Mahamrityunjaya mantras  133  The epic Mahabharata extols Japa  ritualistic chanting  as the greatest duty in the Kali Yuga  what Hindus believe to be the current age   134  Many adopt Japa as their primary spiritual practice  134  Rituals Offerings to Agni during Vivah homa in a Hindu wedding The vast majority of Hindus engage in religious rituals on a daily basis  135  136  Most Hindus observe religious rituals at home  137  but observation of rituals greatly vary among regions  villages  and individuals  Devout Hindus perform daily chores such as worshiping at dawn after bathing  usually at a family shrine  and typically includes lighting a lamp and offering foodstuffs before the images of deities   recitation from religious scripts  singing devotional hymns  meditation  chanting mantras  reciting scriptures etc  137  A notable feature in religious ritual is the division between purity and pollution  Religious acts presuppose some degree of impurity or defilement for the practitioner  which must be overcome or neutralised before or during ritual procedures  Purification  usually with water  is thus a typical feature of most religious action  137  Other characteristics include a belief in the efficacy of sacrifice and concept of merit  gained through the performance of charity or good works  that will accumulate over time and reduce sufferings in the next world  137  Vedic rites of fire oblation  yajna  are now only occasional practices  although they are highly revered in theory  In Hindu wedding and burial ceremonies  however  the yaj a and chanting of Vedic mantras are still the norm  138  The rituals  upacharas  change with time  For instance  in the past few hundred years some rituals  such as sacred dance and music offerings in the standard Sodasa Upacharas set prescribed by the Agama Shastra  were replaced by the offerings of rice and sweets  Occasions like birth  marriage  and death involve what are often elaborate sets of religious customs  In Hinduism  life cycle rituals include Annaprashan  a baby s first intake of solid food   Upanayanam   sacred thread ceremony  undergone by upper caste children at their initiation into formal education  and  r ddha  ritual of treating people to a meal in return for prayers to  God  to give peace to the soul of the deceased   139  140  For most people in India  the betrothal of the young couple and the exact date and time of the wedding are matters decided by the parents in consultation with astrologers  139  On death  cremation is considered obligatory for all except sanyasis  hijra  and children under five  141  Cremation is typically performed by wrapping the corpse in cloth and burning it on a pyre  Pilgrimage

pilgrimages are the Shakti Peethas  where the Mother Goddess is worshipped  the two principal ones being Kalighat and Kamakhya  While there are different yet similar pilgrimage routes in different parts of India  all are respected equally well  according to the universality of Hinduism  Pilgrimage is not mandatory in Hinduism  though many adherents undertake them  142  Festivals Main article  Hindu festivals The festival of lights  Diwali  is celebrated by Hindus all over the world  Hindu festivals  Sanskrit  Utsava  literally   to lift higher   are considered as symbolic rituals that beautifully weave individual and social life to dharma  143  Hinduism has many festivals throughout the year  The Hindu calendar usually prescribe their dates  The festivals typically celebrate events from Hindu mythology  often coinciding with seasonal changes  There are festivals which are primarily celebrated by specific sects or in certain regions of the Indian subcontinent  Some widely observed Hindu festivals are   Maha Shivaratri Pongal Holi Vasant Panchami Thaipusam Ram Navami Krishna Janmastami Ganesh Chaturthi Shigmo Dussera Durga Puja Diwali Gudi Padwa Ugadi Bihu Bonalu Rath Yatra Guru Purnima Raksha Bandhan Onam Gowri Habba Chhath Vishu Some widely observed Hindu festivals The Jagannath Puri with the three chariots of the deities with the Jagannath Temple  Puri in the

Mumbai  Scriptures Main articles   ruti  Smriti  and List of Hindu scriptures Hinduism is based on  the accumulated treasury of spiritual laws discovered by different persons in different times   144  145  The scriptures were transmitted orally in verse form to aid memorization  for many centuries before they were written down  146  Over many centuries  sages refined the teachings and expanded the canon  In post Vedic and current Hindu belief  most Hindu scriptures are not typically interpreted literally  More importance is attached to the ethics and metaphorical meanings derived from them  18  Most sacred texts are in Sanskrit  The texts are classified into two classes  Shruti and Smriti  Shruti The Rig Veda is one of the oldest religious texts  This Rig Veda manuscript is in Devanagari Shruti  lit  that which is heard  147  primarily refers to the Vedas  which form the earliest record of the Hindu scriptures  While many Hindus revere the Vedas as eternal truths revealed to ancient sages    is   145  some devotees do not associate the creation of the Vedas with a god or person  They are thought of as the laws of the spiritual world  which would still exist even if they were not revealed to the sages  144  148  149  Hindus believe that because the spiritual truths of the Vedas are eternal  they continue to be expressed in new ways  150  There are four Vedas  called  g   S ma   Yajus  and Atharva    The Rigveda is the first and most important Veda  151  Each Veda is divided into four parts  the primary one  the Veda proper  being the Sa hit   which contains sacred mantras  The other three parts form a three tier ensemble of commentaries  usually in prose and are believed to be slightly later in age than the Sa hit   These are  the Br hma as   ra yakas  and the Upanishads  The first two parts were subsequently called the Karmak   a  ritualistic portion   while the last two form the J  nak   a  knowledge portion   152  While the Vedas focus on rituals  the Upanishads focus on spiritual insight and philosophical teachings  and discuss Brahman and reincarnation  18  153  154  A well known shloka from Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is                                                                                                                1 3 28  IAST  om asato m  sadgamaya   tamaso m  jyotirgamaya    m tyor m  am ta  gamaya   om   nti   nti   nti      b

Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1 3 28  Smritis Bhagavad Gita  a 19th century manuscript Hindu texts other than the Shrutis are collectively called the Smritis  memory   The most notable of the smritis are the epics  which consist of the Mah bh rata and the R m ya a  The Bhagavad G t  is an integral part of the Mahabharata and one of the most popular sacred texts of Hinduism  It contains philosophical teachings from Krishna  an incarnation of Vishnu  told to the prince Arjuna on the eve of a great war  The Bhagavad G t   spoken by Krishna  is described as the essence of the Vedas  155  However Gita  sometimes called Gitopanishad  is more often placed in the Shruti  category  being Upanishadic in content  156 Pur  as  which illustrate Hindu ideas through vivid narratives come under smritis  Other texts include Dev  Mah tmya  the Tantras  the Yoga Sutras  Tirumantiram  Shiva Sutras and the Hindu  gamas  A more controversial text  the Manusmriti  is a prescriptive lawbook which lays the societal codes of social stratification which later evolved into the Indian caste system  157  A well known verse from Bhagavad Gita describing a concept in Karma Yoga is explained as follows 158  159  To action alone hast thou a right and never at all to its fruits  let not the fruits of action be thy motive  neither let there be in thee any attachment to inaction   2 47  Order of precedence of authority The order of precedence regarding authority of Vedic Scriptures is as follows   ruti  literally  hearing  listening   are the sacred texts comprising the central canon of Hinduism and is one of the three main sources of dharma and therefore is also influential within Hindu Law  160  Sm ti  literally  that which is remembered or recollected    refers to a specific body of Hindu religious scripture  and is a codified component of Hindu customary law  Post Vedic scriptures such as Ramayana  Mahabharata and traditions of the rules on dharma such as Manu Smriti and Yaagnyavalkya Smriti  Smrti also denotes tradition in the sense that it portrays the traditions of the rules on dharma  especially those of lawful virtuous persons   Pur  a  literally  of ancient times   are post vedic scriptures notably consisting of narratives of the history of the universe from creation to destruction  genealogies of kings  heroes  sages  and demigods  and descriptions of Hindu cosmology  philosophy  and geography  161   i   ch ra  literally  that which is followed by good  in recent times    Atmatu  i  literally  that which satisfies oneself  or self validation    according to which one has to decide whether or not to do with bona fide  Initially this was not considered in the order of precedence but Manu and Y j avalkya considered it as last one  That means  if anyone of them contradicts the preceding one then it disqualified as an authority  There is a well known Indian saying that Sm ti follows  ruti  So it was considered that in order to establish any theistic philosophical theory  Astika Siddhanta  one ought not contradict  ruti  Vedas   Adi Sankara has chosen three standards and named as Prasth natray   literally  three points of departure  three standards   Later these were referred to as the three canonical texts of reference of Hindu philosophy by other Vedanta schools  They are  The Upanishads  known as Upadesha prasth na  injunctive texts    part of  ruti  The Bhagavad Gita  known as S dhana prasth na  practical text    part of Sm ti  The Brahma Sutras  known as Ny ya prasth na or Yukti prasthana  part of dar ana of Uttar  M m  s   The Upanishads consist of twelve or thirteen major texts  with many minor texts  The Bhagavad G t  is part of the Mahabh rata The Brahma S tras  also known as the Ved nta S tras   systematise the doctrines taught in the Upanishads and the G t   Demographics Hinduism   Percentage by country Part of a series on Hinduism by country Africa Algeria   Botswana   Cape Verde   Comoros   C te d Ivoire

Demographically  Hinduism is the world s third largest religion  after Christianity and Islam  Society Denominations Main article  Hindu denominations Padmanabhaswamy Temple  the richest temple in India and the world 173  Hinduism has no central doctrinal authority and many practising Hindus do not claim to belong to any particular denomination  174  However  academics categorize contemporary Hinduism into four major denominations  Vaishnavism  Shaivism  Shaktism and Smartism  The denominations differ primarily in the god worshipped as the Supreme One and in the traditions that accompany worship of that god  Vaishnavas worship Vishnu as the supreme God  Shaivites worship Shiva as the supreme  Shaktas worship Shakti  power  personified through a female divinity or Mother Goddess  Devi  while Smartas believe in the essential oneness of five  panchadeva  or six  Shanmata  as Tamil Hindus add Skanda  175  deities as personifications of the Supreme  The Western conception of what Hinduism is has been defined by the Smarta view  many Hindus  who may not understand or follow Advaita philosophy  in contemporary Hinduism  invariably follow the Shanmata belief worshiping many forms of God  One commentator  noting the influence of the Smarta tradition  remarked that although many Hindus may not strictly identify themselves as Smartas but  by adhering to Advaita Vedanta as a foundation for non sectarianism  are indirect followers  176  The Mother Temple of Besakih in Bali  Indonesia  Other denominations like Ganapatya  the cult of Ganesha  and Saura  Sun worship  are not so widespread  There are movements that are not easily placed in any of the above categories  such as Swami Dayananda Saraswati s Arya Samaj  which rejects image worship and veneration of multiple deities  It focuses on the Vedas and the Vedic fire sacrifices  yaj a   The Tantric traditions have various sects  as Banerji observes    Tantras are     also divided as  stika or Vedic and n stika or non Vedic  In accordance with the predominance of the deity the  stika works are again divided as   kta  Shakta    aiva  Shaiva   Saura  G  apatya and Vai  ava  Vaishnava   177    Ashramas Main article  Ashrama A Balmiki Ashram Traditionally the life of a Hindu is divided into four  shramas  phases or stages  unrelated meanings include monastery   The first part of one s life  Brahmacharya  the stage as a student  is spent in celibate  controlled  sober and pure contemplation under the guidance of a Guru  building up the mind for spiritual knowledge  Grihastha is the householder s stage  in which one marries and satisfies k ma and artha in one s married and professional life respectively  see the goals of life   The moral obligations of a Hindu householder include supporting one s parents  children  guests and holy figures  V naprastha  the retirement stage  is gradual detachment from the material world  This may involve giving over duties to one s children  spending more time in religious practices and embarking on holy pilgrimages  Finally  in Sanny sa  the stage of asceticism  one renounces all worldly attachments to secludedly find the Divine through detachment from worldly life and peacefully shed the body for Moksha  178  Monasticism Main article  Sannyasa A sadhu in Madurai  India  Some Hindus choose to live a monastic life  Sanny sa  in pursuit of liberation or another form of spiritual perfection  Monastics commit themselves to a life of simplicity  celibacy  detachment from worldly pursuits  and the contemplation of God  179  A Hindu monk is called a sany s   s dhu  or sw mi  A female renunciate is called a sany sini  Renunciates receive high respect in Hindu society because their outward renunciation of selfishness and worldliness serves as an inspiration to householders who strive for mental renunciation  Some monastics live in monasteries  while others wander from place to place  trusting in God alone to provide for their needs  180  It is considered a highly meritorious act for a householder to provide s dhus with food or other necessaries  S dhus strive to treat all with respect and compassion  whether a person may be poor or rich  good or wicked  and to be indifferent to praise  blame  pleasure  and pain  179  Varnas Main article  Varna in Hinduism Hindu society has traditionally been categorized into four classes  called Varnas  Sanskrit   colour  form  appearance    93  the Brahmins  teachers and priests  the Kshatriyas  warriors  nobles  and kings  the Vaishyas  farmers  merchants  and businessmen  and the Shudras  servants and labourers  Hindus and scholars debate whether the so called caste system is an integral part of Hinduism sanctioned by the scriptures or an outdated social custom  181  Among the scriptures  the Varna system is mentioned sparingly and descriptively  i e   not prescriptive   apart from a single mention in the late Rigvedic Purusha sukta  the rigid division into varnas appears to be post Vedic  appearing in classical texts from the Maurya period  The Bhagavad G t   4 13  states that the four var a divisions are created by God  and the Manusm iti categorizes the different castes  182  However  at the same time  the G t  says that one s var a is to be understood from one s personal qualities and one s work  not one s birth  183  Some mobility and flexibility within the varnas challenge allegations of social discrimination in the caste system  as has been pointed out by several sociologists  184  185  although some other scholars disagree  186  Many social reformers  including Mahatma Gandhi and B  R  Ambedkar  criticized caste discrimination  187  The religious teacher Sri Ramakrishna  1836 1886  taught that    Lovers of God do not belong to any caste         A brahmin without this love is no longer a brahmin  And a pariah with the love of God is no longer a pariah  Through bhakti  devotion to God  an untouchable becomes pure and elevated   188    Ahimsa  vegetarianism and other food customs Main articles  Ahimsa  Vegetarianism and religion  and Cattle in Religion Rajasthani thali  Hindus advocate the practice of ahi s   non violence  and respect for all life because divinity is believed to permeate all beings  including plants and non human animals  189  The term ahi s  appears in the Upanishads  190  the epic Mahabharata 191  and Ahi s  is the first of the five Yamas  vows of self restraint  in Patanjali s Yoga Sutras  192  and the first principle for all member of Varnashrama Dharma  brahmin  kshatriya  vaishya and shudra  in Law of Manu  book 10  sutra 63   Ahimsa  satya  asteya  shaucam and indrayanigraha  almost similar to main principles of jainism   193  194  In accordance with ahi s   many Hindus embrace vegetarianism to respect higher forms of life  Estimates of the number of lacto vegetarians in India  includes adherents of all religions  vary between 20  and 42   195  The food habits vary with the community and region  for example some castes having fewer vegetarians and coastal populations relying on seafood  196  197  Some avoid meat only on specific holy days  Observant Hindus who do eat meat almost always abstain from beef  The cow in Hindu society is traditionally identified as a caretaker and a maternal figure  198  and Hindu society honours the cow as a symbol of unselfish giving  199  Cow slaughter is legally banned in almost all states of India  200  There are many Hindu groups that have continued to abide by a strict vegetarian diet in modern times  One example is the movement known as ISKCON  International Society for Krishna Consciousness   whose followers  not only abstain from meat  fish  and fowl  but also avoid certain vegetables that are thought to have negative properties  such as onion and garlic   201  A second example is the Swaminarayan Movement  The followers of this Hindu group also staunchly adhere to a diet that is devoid of meat  eggs  and seafood  202  Vegetarianism is propagated by the Yajur Veda and it is recommended for a satvic  purifying  lifestyle  203  Thus  another reason that dietary purity is so eminent within Hinduism is because  the idea that food reflects the general qualities of nature  purity  energy  inertia  It follows  then  that a healthy diet should be one that promotes purity within an individual  201  Based on this reasoning  Hindus should avoid or minimize the intake of foods that do not promote purity  These foods include onion and garlic  which are regarded as rajasic  a state which is characterized by  tension and overbearing demeanor   foods  and meat  which is regarded as tamasic  a state which is characterized by  anger  greed  and jealousy    204  Some Hindus from certain sects   generally Shakta  205  certain Shudra and Kshatriya castes 206  207  and certain Eastern Indian 208  and East Asian regions  209  practise animal sacrifice  bali   210  Although most Hindus  including the majority of Vaishnava and Shaivite Hindus abhor it  211  Conversion See also  Conversion to Hinduism and Religious conversion Hinduism Concepts of conversion  evangelization  and proselytization are absent from Hindu texts and have never played a significant role in practice  though acceptance of willing converts is becoming more common  Early in its history  in the absence of other competing religions  Hindus considered everyone they came across as Hindus and expected everyone they met to be Hindus  212  213  Hindus today continue to be influenced by historical ideas of acceptability of conversion  Hence  many Hindus continue to believe that Hinduism is an identity that can only be had from birth  while many others continue to believe that anyone who follows Hindu beliefs and practices is a Hindu  and many believe in some form of both theories  However  as a reaction to perceived and actual threat of evangelization  proselytization  and conversion activities of other major religions most modern Hindus are opposed to the idea of conversion from  any  one religion to  any  other per se  214  Hindus in Western countries generally accept and welcome willing converts  whereas in India acceptance of willing converts is becoming more common  With the rise of Hindu revivalist movements  reconversions to Hinduism have also risen  215  Reconversions are well accepted since conversion out of Hinduism is not recognized  216  Conversion into Hinduism through marriage is well accepted and often expected to enable the non Hindu partner to fully participate in their spiritual  religious  and cultural roles within the larger Hindu family and society  citation needed  There is no formal process for converting to Hinduism  although in many traditions a ritual called d ksh    initiation   marks the beginning of spiritual life  A ritual called shuddhi   purification   sometimes marks the return to spiritual life after reconversion  Most Hindu sects do not seek converts  217  218  219  220  as they believe that the goals of spiritual life can be attained through any religion  as long as it is practiced sincerely  217  221  However  some Hindu sects and affiliates such as Arya Samaj  Saiva Siddhanta Church  BAPS  the International Society for Krishna Consciousness  Bishnoi accept those who have a desire to follow Hinduism  In general  Hindu view of religious freedom is not based on the freedom to proselytize  but the right to retain one s religion and not be subject to proselytization  Hindu leaders are advocating for changing the existing formulation of the freedom of religion clause in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights since it favours religions which proselytize  222  See also Hinduism Atheism in Hinduism Criticism of Hinduism Hindu Hindu calendar Hindu deities

pillars of Indian theologies  samsara   the belief that life in this world is one of suffering and subject to repeated deaths and births  rebirth   moksa nirvana   the goal of human existence

Delhi  Oxford University Press  1998  p 67  55 before the eighth century  the Buddha was accorded the position of universal deity and ceremonies by which a king attained to imperial status were elaborate donative ceremonies entailing gifts to Buddhist monks and the installation of a symbolic Buddha in a stupa    This pattern changed in the eighth century  The Buddha was replaced as the supreme  imperial deity by one of the Hindu gods  except under the Palas of eastern India  the Buddha s homeland    Previously the Buddha had been accorded imperial style worship  puja   Now as one of the Hindu gods replaced the Buddha at the imperial centre and pinnacle of the cosmo political system  the image or symbol of the Hindu god comes to be housed in a monumental temple and given increasingly elaborate imperial style puja worship     Holt  John  The Buddhist Visnu  Columbia University Press  2004  p 12 15  The replacement of the Buddha as the  cosmic person  within the mythic
