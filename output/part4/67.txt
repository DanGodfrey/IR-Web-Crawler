is uncertain  32  It is an ancient name and can be found in sources from the 2nd century  It is recorded c  121 as Londinium  which points to Romano British origin  32  The earliest attempted explanation  now disregarded  is attributed to Geoffrey of Monmouth in Historia Regum Britanniae  32  This had it that the name originated from a supposed King Lud  who had allegedly taken over the city and named it Kaerlud  33  From 1899 it was commonly accepted that the name was of Celtic origin and meant place belonging to a man called  Londinos  this explanation has since been rejected  32 Richard Coates put forward an explanation in 1998 that it is derived from the pre Celtic Old European   p lowonida  meaning  river too wide to ford   and suggested that this was a name given to the part of the River Thames which flows through London  from this  the settlement gained the Celtic form of its name   Lowonidonjon  34  Until 1889 the name  London  officially only applied to the City of London but since then it has also referred to the County of London and now Greater London  4  Prehistory and antiquity In 1300 the City was still confined within the Roman walls  Although there is evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area  the first major settlement was founded by the Romans in 43 AD  35  This lasted for just seventeen years and around 61  the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it  burning it to the ground  36  The next  heavily planned incarnation of the city prospered and superseded Colchester as the capital of the Roman province of Britannia in 100  At its height during the 2nd century  Roman London had a population of around 60 000  By the 7th century  the Anglo Saxons had created a new settlement called Lundenwic over a mile  2 km  upstream from the old Roman city  around what is now Covent Garden  37  It is likely that there was a harbour at the mouth of the River Fleet for fishing and trading  and this trading grew  until the city was overcome by the Vikings and forced to move east  back to the location of the Roman Londinium  in order to use its walls for protection  38  Viking attacks continued to increase  until 886 when Alfred the Great recaptured London and made peace with the Danish leader  Guthrum  39  The original Saxon city of Lundenwic became Ealdwic   old city    a name surviving to the present day as Aldwych  which is in the modern City of Westminster  40  Two recent discoveries indicate that London could be much older than previously thought  In 1999 the remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the foreshore north of Vauxhall Bridge  41  This bridge either crossed the Thames  or went to a  lost  island in the river  Dendrology dated the timbers to 1500BC  In 2010 the foundations of a large timber structure  dated to 4500BC  were found on the Thames foreshore  South of Vauxhall Bridge  42  The function of the mesolithic structure is not known  but it covers at least 50m x 10m  and numerous 30 cm posts are visible at low tides  Both structures are on South Bank  at a natural crossing point where the River Effra flows into the River Thames  and 4 km upstream from the Roman City of London  The effort required to construct these structures implies trade  stability  and a community size of several hundred people at least  Middle Ages The Lancastrian siege of London in 1471 is attacked by a Yorkist sally  With the collapse of Roman rule in the early 5th century  London was effectively abandoned  However  from the 6th century an Anglo Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed slightly to the west of the old Roman city  around what is now Covent Garden and the Strand  rising to a likely population of 10 12 000  37  In the 9th century London was repeatedly attacked by Vikings  leading to a relocation of the city back to the location of Roman Londinium  in order to use its walls for protection  38  Following the unification of England in the 10th century London  already the country s largest city and most important trading centre  became increasingly important as a political centre  although it still faced competition from Winchester  the traditional centre of the kingdom of Wessex  In the 11th century King Edward the Confessor re founded and rebuilt Westminster Abbey and Westminster  a short distance upstream from London became a favoured royal residence  From this point onward Westminster steadily supplanted the City of London itself as a venue for the business of national government  43  Westminster Abbey is a World Heritage Site and one of London s oldest and most important buildings as seen in this painting  Canaletto  1749 A D   Following his victory in the Battle of Hastings  William  Duke of Normandy  was crowned King of England in the newly finished Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066  44  William constructed the Tower of London  the first of the many Norman castles in England to be rebuilt in stone  in the southeastern corner of the city to intimidate the native inhabitants  45  In 1097  William II began the building of Westminster Hall  close by the abbey of the same name  The hall became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster  46  47  During the 12th century the institutions of central government  which had hitherto accompanied the royal court as it moved around the country  grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed in one place  In most cases this was Westminster  although the royal treasury  having been moved from Winchester  came to rest in the Tower  While the City of Westminster developed into a true capital in governmental terms  its distinct neighbour  the City of London  remained England s largest city and principal commercial centre and flourished under its own unique administration  the Corporation of London  In 1100 its population was around 18 000  by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100 000  48  Disaster struck during the Black Death in the mid 14th century  when London lost nearly a third of its population  49  London was the focus of the Peasants  Revolt in 1381  50  Early modern The Great Fire of London destroyed many parts of the city in 1666  London in 1806 During the Tudor period the Reformation produced a gradual shift to Protestantism  with much of London passing from church to private ownership  51 Mercantilism grew and monopoly trading companies such as the East India Company were established  with trade expanding to the New World  London became the principal North Sea port  with migrants arriving from England and abroad  The population rose from an estimated 50 000 in 1530 to about 225 000 in 1605  51  In the 16th century William Shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in London at a time of hostility to the development of the theatre  By the end of the Tudor period in 1603  London was still very compact  There was an assassination attempt on James I in Westminster  through the Gunpowder Plot on 5 November 1605  52  London was plagued by disease in the early 17th ref century  53  culminating in the Great Plague of 1665 1666  which killed up to 100 000 people  or a fifth of the population  54  The Great Fire of London broke out in 1666 in Pudding Lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden buildings  55  Rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by Robert Hooke 56  57  58  as Surveyor of London  59  In 1708 Christopher Wren s masterpiece  St Paul s Cathedral was completed  During the Georgian era new districts such as Mayfair were formed in the west  and new bridges over the Thames encouraged development in South London  In the east  the Port of London expanded downstream  In 1762 George III acquired Buckingham House and it was enlarged over the next 75 years  During the 18th century  London was dogged by crime and the Bow Street Runners were established in 1750 as a professional police force  60  In total  more than 200 offences were punishable by death  61  and women and children were hanged for petty theft  62  Over 74 per cent of children born in London died before they were five  63  The coffeehouse became a popular place to debate ideas  with growing literacy and the development of the printing press making news widely available  and Fleet Street became the centre of the British press    You find no man  at all intellectual  who is willing to leave London  No  Sir  when a man is tired of London  he is tired of life  for there is in London all that life can afford     Samuel Johnson  1777 64  Late modern and contemporary A London street hit during the Blitz of World War II London was the world s largest city from about 1831 to 1925  65  London s overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics  66  claiming 14 000 lives in 1848  and 6 000 in 1866  67  Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world s first local urban rail network  The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion  It was replaced in 1889 by the London County Council  London s first elected city wide administration  The Blitz and other bombing by the German Luftwaffe during World War II killed over 30 000 Londoners and destroyed large tracts of housing and other buildings across London  Immediately after the war  the 1948 Summer Olympics were held at the original Wembley Stadium  at a time when the city had barely recovered from the war  In 1951 the Festival of Britain was held on the South Bank  The Great Smog of 1952 led to the Clean Air Act 1956  which ended the  pea souper  fogs for which London had been notorious  From the 1940s onwards  London became home to a large number of immigrants  largely from Commonwealth countries such as Jamaica  India  Bangladesh and Pakistan  making London one of the most diverse cities in Europe  Primarily starting in the mid 1960s  London became a centre for the worldwide youth culture  exemplified by the Swinging London subculture associated with The King s Road  Chelsea and Carnaby Street  The role of trendsetter was revived during the punk era  In 1965 London s political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area and a new Greater London Council was created  During The Troubles in Northern Ireland  London was subjected to bombing attacks by the Provisional IRA  Racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 Brixton riot  Greater London s population declined steadily in the decades after World War II  from an estimated peak of 8 6 million in 1939 to around 6 8 million in the 1980s  The principal ports for London moved downstream to Felixstowe and Tilbury  with the London Docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration as the Canary Wharf development  This was borne out of London s ever increasing role as a major international financial centre during the 1980s  The Thames Barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the North Sea  The Greater London Council was abolished in 1986  which left London as the only large metropolis in the world without a central administration  In 2000  London wide government was restored  with the creation of the Greater London Authority  To celebrate the start of the 21st century  the Millennium Dome  London Eye and Millennium Bridge were constructed  On 7 July 2005  three London Underground trains and a double decker bus were bombed in a series of terrorist attacks  68  Government Local government Main articles  Local government in London  History of local government in London  and List of heads of London government The current sub regions as defined by the Greater London Authority The Greater London Authority is based in City Hall  Southwark The administration of London is formed of two tiers a city wide  strategic tier and a local tier  City wide administration is coordinated by the Greater London Authority  GLA   while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities  69  The GLA consists of two elected components  the Mayor of London  who has executive powers  and the London Assembly  who scrutinise the mayor s decisions and can accept or reject his budget proposals each year  The headquarters of the GLA is City Hall  Southwark  the current mayor is Boris Johnson  The mayor s statutory planning strategy is published as the London Plan  which as of mid 2009 update  is being revised  for final publication in 2011  The local authorities are the councils of the 32 London boroughs and the City of London Corporation  70  They are responsible for most local services  such as local planning  schools  social services  local roads and refuse collection  Certain functions  such as waste management  are provided through joint arrangements  In 2009 2010 the combined revenue expenditure by London councils and the GLA amounted to just over 22 billion    14 7 billion   for the boroughs and 7 4 billion   for the GLA  71  Policing in Greater London  with the exception of the City of London  is provided by the Metropolitan Police Force  overseen by the Metropolitan Police Authority  The City of London has its own police force   the City of London Police  72  The British Transport Police are responsible for police services on National Rail and London Underground services in the capital  73  The London Fire Brigade is the statutory fire and rescue service for Greater London  It is run by the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority and is the third largest fire service in the world  74 National Health Service ambulance services are provided by the London Ambulance Service  LAS  NHS Trust  the largest free at the point of use emergency ambulance service in the world  75  The London Air Ambulance charity operates in conjunction with the LAS where required  Her Majesty s Coastguard and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution operate on the River Thames  76  77  National government London is the seat of the Government of the United Kingdom  which is located around the Palace of Westminster  Many government departments are located close to Parliament  particularly along Whitehall  including the Prime Minister s residence at 10 Downing Street  78  The British Parliament is often referred to as the  Mother of Parliaments   although this sobriquet was first applied to England itself by John Bright  79  because it has been the model for most other parliamentary systems  and its Acts have created many other parliaments  Geography Main article  Geography of London Satellite view of London Scope Map of central London Greater London is the top level administrative subdivision covering London  The small  ancient City of London at its core once contained the whole settlement  but as the urban area grew the City Corporation resisted attempts to amalgamate it with its suburbs  causing  London  to be defined in a number ways for different purposes  and the situation was once open to legal debate  80  Forty per cent of Greater London is covered by the London post town  within which  LONDON  forms part of postal addresses  81  82  The London telephone area code  020  covers a larger area  similar in size to Greater London  although some outer districts are omitted and some places just outside are included  The area within the orbital M25 motorway is normally what is referred to as  London   83  and the Greater London boundary has been aligned to it in places  84  Outward urban expansion is now prevented by the Metropolitan Green Belt  85  although the built up area extends beyond the boundary in places  resulting in a separately defined Greater London Urban Area  Beyond this is the vast London commuter belt  86  Greater London is split for some purposes into Inner London and Outer London  87  The city is split by the River Thames into North and South  with an informal central London area in its interior  The coordinates of the nominal centre of London  traditionally considered to be the original Eleanor Cross at Charing Cross near the junction of Trafalgar Square and Whitehall  are approximately 51 30 26 N 00 07 39 W     51 50722 N 0 1275 W    51 50722   0 1275  88  Status Within London  both the City of London and the City of Westminster have city status and both the City of London and the remainder of Greater London are the ceremonial counties  89  The current area of Greater London has incorporated areas that were once part of the counties of Middlesex  Kent  Surrey  Essex and Hertfordshire  90  London s status as the capital of England  and later the United Kingdom  has never been granted or confirmed officially by statute or in written form  note 3  Its position was formed through constitutional convention  making its status as de facto capital a part of the UK s unwritten constitution  The capital of England was moved to London from Winchester as the Palace of Westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court  and thus the political capital of the nation  94  More recently  Greater London has been defined as a region of England and in this context known as London  5  Topography Primrose Hill Greater London covers an area of 1 583 square kilometres  611 sq mi   an area which had a population of 7 172 036 in 2001 and a population density of 4 542 inhabitants per square kilometre  11 760  sq mi   A larger area  referred to as the London Metropolitan Region or the London Metropolitan Agglomeration covers an area of 8 382 square kilometres  3 236 sq mi  has a population of 12 653 500 and a population density of 1 510 inhabitants per square kilometre  3 900  sq mi   95  Modern London stands on the Thames  its primary geographical feature  a navigable river which crosses the city from the south west to the east  The Thames Valley is a floodplain surrounded by gently rolling hills including Parliament Hill  Addington Hills  and Primrose Hill  The Thames was once a much broader  shallower river with extensive marshlands  at high tide  its shores reached five times their present width  96  Since the Victorian era the Thames has been extensively embanked  and many of its London tributaries now flow underground  The Thames is a tidal river  and London is vulnerable to flooding  97  The threat has increased over time due to a slow but continuous rise in high water level by the slow  tilting  of Britain  up in the north and down in the south  caused by post glacial rebound  98  In 1974  a decade of work began on the construction of the Thames Barrier across the Thames at Woolwich to deal with this threat  While the barrier is expected to function as designed until roughly 2070  concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being discussed  99  Climate London Climate chart  explanation  J F M A M J

in   do  100  Winters are generally chilly to cold with frost usually occurring in the suburbs on average twice a week from November to March  Snow usually occurs about 4 or 5 times a year mostly from December to February  Snowfall during March and April is rare but does occur every 2 3 years  Winter temperatures seldom fall below  4  C  24 8  F  or rise above 14  C  57 2  F   During the winter of 2010  London experienced its lowest temperature on record   14  C  6 8  F   in Northolt and the heaviest snow seen for almost two decades  a huge strain on London s transport infrastructure  Summers are generally warm and sometimes hot  the heat being boosted by the urban heat island effect making the centre of London at times 5 C  9 F  warmer than the suburbs and outskirts  London s summer average is 24  C  75 2  F   On average there are 7 days a year above 30  C  86 0  F  and 2 days a year above 32  C  89 6  F   Temperatures of 26 C  80 F  usually occur on a weekly basis from mid  June to late August  During the 2003 European heat wave there were 14 consecutive days above 30  C  86 0  F  and 2 consecutive days where temperatures soared up to 38  C  100 4  F   leading to hundreds of heat related deaths  Rain generally occurs on around 2 out of 10 summer days  Spring and Autumn are mixed seasons and can be pleasant  In 2011  October 1st reached 30  C  86 0  F  and in April 2011 it reached 28  C  82 4  F   However in recent years both of these months have also had snowfall  Temperature extremes range from  10  C  14 0  F  to 37 9  C  100 2  F   Climate data for London  Greenwich
