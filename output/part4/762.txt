American International Building in New York City  The British headquarters office is on Fenchurch Street in London  continental Europe operations are based in La D fense  Paris  and its Asian headquarters office is in Hong Kong  According to the 2011 Forbes Global 2000 list  AIG was the 29th largest public company in the world  4  5  It was listed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average from

International Building in Lower Manhattan  AIG history dates back to 1919  when Cornelius Vander Starr established an insurance agency in Shanghai  China  Starr was the first Westerner in Shanghai to sell insurance to the Chinese  which he continued to do until AIG left China in early 1949 as Mao Zedong led the advance of the Communist People s Liberation Army on Shanghai  8  9  Starr then moved the company headquarters to its current home in New York City  10  The company went on to expand  often through subsidiaries  into other markets  including other parts of Asia  Latin America  Europe  and the Middle East  11  In 1962  Starr gave management of the company s lagging U S  holdings to Maurice R   Hank  Greenberg  who shifted its focus from personal insurance to high margin corporate coverage  Greenberg focused on selling insurance through independent brokers rather than agents to eliminate agent salaries  Using brokers  AIG could price insurance according to its potential return even if it suffered decreased sales of certain products for great lengths of time with very little extra expense  In 1968  Starr named Greenberg his successor  The company went public in 1969  12  Beginning in 2005  AIG became embroiled in a series of fraud investigations conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission  U S  Justice Department  and New York State Attorney General s Office  Greenberg was ousted amid an accounting scandal in February 2005  he is still fighting civil charges being pursued by New York state  13  14  15  The New York Attorney General s investigation led to a  1 6 billion fine for AIG and criminal charges for some of its executives  16  Greenberg was succeeded as CEO by Martin J  Sullivan  who had begun his career at AIG as a clerk in its London office in 1970  17  On June 15  2008  after disclosure of financial losses and subsequent to a falling stock price  Sullivan resigned and was replaced by Robert B  Willumstad  Chairman of the AIG Board of Directors since 2006  Willumstad was forced by the US government to step down and was replaced by Edward M  Liddy on September 17  2008  18  AIG s board of directors named Robert Benmosche CEO on August 3  2009 to replace Mr  Liddy  who earlier in the year announced his retirement  19   edit  Business  edit  Holdings Further information  Holdings of American International Group In the United

crisis On September 16  2008  AIG suffered a liquidity crisis following the downgrade of its credit rating  Industry practice permits firms with the highest credit ratings to enter swaps without depositing collateral with their trading counter parties  When its credit rating was downgraded  the company was required to post additional collateral with its trading counter parties  and this led to an AIG liquidity crisis  AIG s London unit sold credit protection in the form of credit default swaps  CDSs  on collateralized debt obligations  CDOs  that had by that time declined in value  25  The United States Federal Reserve Bank announced the creation of a secured credit facility of up to US 85 billion  to prevent the company s collapse by enabling AIG to meet its obligations to deliver additional collateral to its credit default swap trading partners  The credit facility provided a structure to loan as much as US 85 billion  secured by the stock in AIG owned subsidiaries  in exchange for warrants for a 79 9  equity stake  and the right to suspend dividends to previously issued common and preferred stock  17  26  27  AIG announced the same day that its board accepted the terms of the Federal Reserve Bank s rescue package and secured credit facility  28  This was the largest government bailout of a private company in U S  history  though smaller than the bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac a week earlier  29  30  AIG s share prices had fallen over 95  to just  1 25 by September 16  2008  from a 52 week high of  70 13  citation needed  The company reported over  13 2 billion in losses in the first six months of the year  31  32  The AIG Financial Products division headed by Joseph Cassano  in London  had entered into credit default swaps to insure  441 billion worth of securities originally rated AAA  Of those securities   57 8 billion were structured debt securities backed by subprime loans  33 CNN named Cassano as one of the  Ten Most Wanted  Culprits  of the 2008 financial collapse in the United States  34  As Lehman Brothers  the largest bankruptcy in U S  history at that time  suffered a catastrophic decline in share price  investors began comparing the types of securities held by AIG and Lehman  and found that AIG had valued its Alt A and sub prime mortgage backed securities at 1 7 to 2 times the values used by Lehman which weakened investors  confidence in AIG  31  On September 14  2008  AIG announced it was considering selling its aircraft leasing division  International Lease Finance Corporation  to raise cash  31  The Federal Reserve hired Morgan Stanley to determine if there are systemic risks to a financial failure of AIG  and asked private entities to supply short term bridge loans to the company  In the meantime  New York regulators allowed AIG to borrow  20 billion from its subsidiaries  35  36  At the stock market s opening on September 16  2008  AIG s stock dropped 60 percent  37  The Federal Reserve continued to meet that day with major Wall Street investment firms  hoping to broker a deal for a non governmental  75 billion line of credit to the company  38  Rating agencies Moody s and Standard and Poor downgraded AIG s credit ratings on concerns over likely continuing losses on mortgage backed securities  The credit rating downgrade forced the company to deliver collateral of over  10 billion to certain creditors and CDS counter parties  39 The New York Times later reported that talks on Wall Street had broken down and AIG may file for bankruptcy protection on Wednesday  September 17  40  Just before the bailout by the US Federal Reserve  AIG former CEO Maurice  Hank  Greenberg sent an impassioned letter to AIG CEO Robert B  Willumstad offering his assistance in any way possible  ccing the Board of Directors  His offer was rebuffed  41   edit  Federal Reserve bailout On the evening of September 16  2008  the Federal Reserve Bank s Board of Governors announced that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had been authorized to create a 24 month credit liquidity facility from which AIG could draw up to  85 billion  The loan was collateralized by the assets of AIG  including its non regulated subsidiaries and the stock of  substantially all  of its regulated subsidiaries  and with an interest rate of 850 basis points over the three month London Interbank Offered Rate  LIBOR   i e   LIBOR plus 8 5    In exchange for the credit facility  the U S  government received warrants for a 79 9 percent equity stake in AIG  with the right to suspend the payment of dividends to AIG common and preferred shareholders  17  27  The credit facility was created under the auspices of Section 13 3  of the Federal Reserve Act  27  42  43  AIG s board of directors announced approval of the loan transaction in a press release the same day  The announcement did not comment on the issuance of a warrant for 79 9  of AIG s equity  but the AIG 8 K filing of September 18  2008  reporting the transaction to the Securities and Exchange Commission stated that a warrant for 79 9  of AIG shares had been issued to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  17  28  44  AIG drew down US  28 billion of the credit liquidity facility on September 17  2008  45  On September 22  2008  AIG was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average  46  An additional  37 8 billion credit facility was established in October  As of October 24  AIG had drawn a total of  90 3 billion from the emergency loan  of a total  122 8 billion  47  Maurice Greenberg  former CEO of AIG  on September 17  2008  characterized the bailout as a nationalization of AIG  He also stated that he was bewildered by the situation and was at a loss over how the entire situation got out of control as it did  48  On September 17  2008  Federal Reserve Board chair Ben Bernanke asked Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson join him  to call on members of Congress  to describe the need for a congressionally authorized bailout of the nation s banking system  Weeks later  Congress approved the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008  Bernanke said to Paulson on September 17   We can t keep doing this  Both because we at the Fed don t have the necessary resources and for reasons of democratic legitimacy  it s important that the Congress come in and take control of the situation   49   edit  Additional bailouts of 2008 From mid September till early November  AIG s credit default spreads were steadily rising  implying the company was heading for default  50  51  On November 10  2008  the U S  Treasury announced it would purchase  40 billion in newly issued AIG senior preferred stock  under the authority of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act s Troubled Asset Relief Program  52  53  54  The FRBNY announced that it would modify the September 16 secured credit facility  the Treasury investment would permit a reduction in its size from  85 billion to  60 billion  and that the FRBNY would extend the life of the facility from three to five years  and change the interest rate from 8 5  plus the three month London interbank offered rate  LIBOR  for the total credit facility  to 3  plus LIBOR for funds drawn down  and 0 75  plus LIBOR for funds not drawn  and that AIG would create two off  balance sheet Limited Liability Companies  LLC  to hold AIG assets  one to act as an AIG Residential Mortgage Backed Securities Facility and the second to act as an AIG Collateralized Debt Obligations Facility  52  54 Federal officials said the  40 billion investment would ultimately permit the government to reduce the total exposure to AIG to  112 billion from  152 billion  52  On December 15  2008  the Thomas More Law Center filed suit to challenge the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008  alleging that it unconstitutionally promotes Islamic law  Sharia  and religion  The lawsuit was filed because AIG provides Takaful Insurance Plans  which  according to the company  avoid investments and transactions that are un Islamic   55  56  As of January 2012  TARP had about  50 billion invested in AIG according to one report  Break even for the government was figured at  28 73 a share v  then current share price of about  25  57   edit  Counterparty controversy AIG was required to post additional collateral with many creditors and counter parties  touching off controversy when over  100 billion was paid out to major global financial institutions that had previously received TARP money  While this money was legally owed to the banks by AIG  under agreements made via credit default swaps purchased from AIG by the institutions   a number of Congressmen and media members expressed outrage that taxpayer money was going to these banks through AIG  58  In January  2010  a document known as  Schedule A   List of Derivative Transactions  was released to the public  against the wishes of the New York Fed  It listed many of the insurance deals that AIG had with various other parties  such as Goldman Sachs  Soci t  G n rale  Deutsche Bank  and Merrill Lynch  59  60  Had AIG been allowed to fail in a controlled manner through bankruptcy  bondholders and derivative counterparties  major banks  would have suffered significant losses  limiting the amount of taxpayer funds directly used  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke argued   If a federal agency had  appropriate authority  on September 16   2008   they could have been used to put AIG into conservatorship or receivership  unwind it slowly  protect policyholders  and impose haircuts on creditors and counterparties as appropriate  That outcome would have been far preferable to the situation we find ourselves in now   61   edit  Post bailout expenditures The week following the September bailout  AIG employees and distributors participated in a California retreat which cost  444 000 and featured spa treatments  banquets  and golf outings  62  63  It was reported that the trip was a reward for top performing life insurance agents planned before the bailout  64  Less than 24 hours after the news of the party was first reported by the media  it was reported that the Federal Reserve had agreed to give AIG an additional loan of up to  37 8 billion  65  AP reported on October 17 that AIG executives spent  86 000 on a previously scheduled English hunting trip  News of the lavish spending came just days after AIG received an additional  37 8 billion loan from the Federal Reserve  on top of a previous  85 billion emergency loan granted the month before  Regarding the hunting trip  the company responded   We regret that this event was not canceled   66  An October 30  2008 article from CNBC reported that AIG had already drawn upon  90 billion of the  123 billion allocated for loans  67  On November 10  2008  just a few days before renegotiating another bailout with the US Government for  40 billion  ABC News reported that AIG spent  343 000 on a trip to a lavish resort in Phoenix  Arizona   68   edit  Settlement of credit default swaps On October 22  2008  those creditors of Lehman Brothers who bought credit default swaps to hedge them against Lehman bankruptcy settled those accounts  The net payments were  5 2 billion 69  even though initial estimates of the amount of the settlement were between  100 billion and  400 billion  70  By December 2008  AIG had paid at least  18 7 billion to various financial institutions  including Goldman Sachs and Soci t  G n rale to retire obligations related to credit default swaps  CDS   As much as  53 5 billion related to swap payouts are part of the bailout  71  On March 15  2009  under mounting pressure from Congress and after consultation with the Federal Reserve  AIG disclosed a list of major recipients of collateral postings and payments under credit default swaps  guaranteed investment agreements  and securities lending agreements  72  Below is data from one of the charts AIG released  representing only a portion of the total payouts  over a period of a few months  AIG collateral postings to credit default swap counterparties  from the period September 16  2008 to December

the weakening financial condition of potential bidders  has challenged its efforts  If the U S  government decides to continue to protect the company from falling into bankruptcy  it may have to take the assets itself in exchange for the loans  or offer further direct financial support  75  As of September 6  2009  The Wall Street Journal reported that Pacific Century Group had agreed to pay  500 million for a part of American International Group s asset management business  and that they also expected to pay an additional  200 million to AIG in carried interest and other payments linked to future performance of the business  76  Also in 2009  AIG sold its operations in Colombia to Ecuador s Banco del Pichincha  On March 1  2010  insurance company Prudential confirmed that it was in advanced negotiations to buy the Asian operations of AIG  77  Prudential was to buy the pan Asian life insurance company  American International Assurance  AIA   for approximately  35 5 billion  78  On June 1  2010 the deal failed because AIG would not accept the  30 5 billion after Prudential lowered the amount by  5 billion from the originally planned  35 5 billion after Prudential shareholder discontent  79  AIG agreed on March 8  2010  to sell its American Life Insurance Co  unit  ALICO  to MetLife Inc  for  15 5 billion in cash and stock by November 1  2010  Alico has annuities  life and health insurance operations in Japan  Middle East  including Nepal  Bangladesh and Pakistan   Western and Eastern Europe  Latin America and the Caribbean  AIG said it will sell Alico for  6 8 billion in cash and the remainder in MetLife equity  The deal leaves AIG as the second largest shareholder of MetLife  with a stake of more than 20  in the company  On March 29  2010  Bloomberg L P  reported that after almost three months of delays  AIG had completed the  500 million sale of a portion of its asset management business  branded PineBridge Investments  to the Asia based Pacific Century Group  80  On September 30  2010  AIG announced an agreement to sell two of its life insurance companies in Japan  AIG Star and AIG Edison  to Prudential Financial for  4 2 billion in cash and  600 million in the assumption of third party debt to help repay some of the money owed to the U S  government  81  On November 1  2010  AIG announced it had raised  36 71 billion from the sale of ALICO and an initial public offering for AIA  The company will use the proceeds Federal Reserve Bank of New York credit facility and make payments on other interests owned by the government  82  On September 2  2011  AIG filed with the SEC to spin off their aircraft leasing firm  International Lease Finance Corporation  ILFC   in an initial public offering  83   edit  Record losses On March 2  2009  AIG reported a fourth quarter loss of  61 7bn   43bn  and revenue of   23 7bn    16 2bn  for the final three months of 2008  This was the largest quarterly loss in corporate history at that time  84  The announcement of the loss had an impact on morning trading in Europe and Asia  with the FTSE100  DAX and Nikkei all suffering sharp falls  In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell to below 7000 points  a twelve year low  85  86  The news of the loss came the day after the U S  Treasury Department had confirmed that AIG was to get an additional  30 billion in aid  on top of the  150 billion it has already received  87  The Treasury Department suggested that the potential losses to the US and global economy would be  extremely high  if it were to collapse 88  and has suggested that if in future there is no improvement  it will invest more money into the company  as it is unwilling to allow it to fail  89  The firm s position as not just a domestic insurer  but also one for small businesses and many listed firms  has prompted US officials to suggest its demise could be  disastrous  and the Federal Reserve said that AIG posed a  systemic risk  to the global economy  84  The fourth quarter result meant the company made a  99 29 billion loss for the whole of 2008  88  with five consecutive quarters of losses costing the company well over  100 billion  89  In a testimony before the Senate Budget Committee on March 3  2009  the Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke stated that  AIG exploited a huge gap in the regulatory system       and  to nobody s surprise  made irresponsible bets and took huge losses   90   edit  2009 employee bonus payments Main article  AIG bonus payments controversy In March 2009  AIG announced that they were paying  165 million in executive bonuses  Total bonuses for the financial unit could reach  450 million and bonuses for the entire company could reach  1 2 billion  91  President Barack Obama  who voted for the AIG bailout as a Senator 92  responded to the planned payments by saying   I t s hard to understand how derivative traders at AIG warranted any bonuses  much less  165 million in extra pay  How do they justify this outrage to the taxpayers who are keeping the company afloat   and  In the last six months  AIG has received substantial sums from the U S  Treasury  I ve asked Secretary Geithner to use that leverage and pursue every legal avenue to block these bonuses and make the American taxpayers whole   93  Protester outside 60 Wall Street Deutsche Bank s US main office in the wake of the bonus controversy is interviewed by news media  Politicians on both sides of the Congressional aisle reacted with outrage to the planned bonuses  Senator Chuck Grassley  R Iowa  said  I would suggest the first thing that would make me feel a little bit better toward them if they d follow the Japanese example and come before the American people and take that deep bow and say  I m sorry  and then either do one of two things  resign or go commit suicide   94  Senator Chuck Schumer  D New York  accused AIG of  Alice in Wonderland business practices  and said  It boggles the mind   He has threatened to tax the bonuses at up to 100   95  Senator Richard Shelby  R Alabama  said  These people brought this on themselves  Now you re rewarding failure  A lot of these people should be fired  not awarded bonuses  This is horrible  It s outrageous   96  Senator Mitch McConnell  R Kentucky  echoed his comments  saying  This is an outrage   97  Senator Jon Tester  D Montana  said  This is ridiculous   and AIG executives  need to understand that the only reason they even have a job is because of the taxpayers   98  Senator Dick Durbin  D Illinois  said  I ve had it   and  The fact that they continue to do it while we pour in billions of dollars is indefensible   99  Representative Barney Frank  D Massachusetts   Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee  said paying these bonuses would be  rewarding incompetence  98  and  These people may have a right to their bonuses  They don t have a right to their jobs forever   96  Representative Mark Kirk  R Illinois  said  AIG should not be on welfare from Uncle Sam  and yet paying bonuses and transferring a considerable amount of taxpayer funds to entities overseas   99 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said  It makes me angry  I slammed the phone more than a few times on discussing AIG   96 Lawrence Summers  Director of the National Economic Council  said  The easy thing would be to just say  you know   Off with their heads   and violate the contracts  but you have to think about the consequences of breaking contracts for the overall system of law   100 Austan Goolsbee  of the Council of Economic Advisers said  I don t know why they would follow a policy that s really not sensible  is obviously going to ignite the ire of millions of people   and  You worry about that backlash   101  Political commentators and journalists expressed an equally bipartisan outrage  94  102  103  104  104  105  106  107  108  109  110  On March 24  2009  The New York Times printed the resignation letter of Jake DeSantis  executive vice president of AIG s financial products unit  to Edward M  Liddy  the chief executive of AIG  DeSantis stated he had nothing to do with the credit default swaps  he lost much of his life savings in the form of deferred compensation invested in the capital of AIG Financial Products  he had agreed to work for an annual salary of  1 out of a sense of duty  that he was assured many times the bonuses would be paid in March 2009  and that he believed he and others were let down by Liddy s lack of support  He also stated he was going to donate his bonus to those suffering from the global economic downturn  111  It was reported that Senator Christopher Dodd  D Con   who first denied  then admitted to amending the legislation to allow the AIG bonuses   received  160 000 from employees of AIG  112  113  114  115  A memo issued in 2006 by Joseph Cassano  AIG Financial Products chief executive  urged AIG employees to donate to Dodd  saying that as  next in line to become chairman of

alleging fraud and other inproprieties which were approved by the office of its then chairman  Maurice Greenberg  These problems placed such a focus on AIG s activities that it created a level of required transparency and fear of getting caught  which many believe forced the company to be less active and willing to cheat its way out of these problems  A manner of doing business it learned with its core activity of denying legitimate insurance claims and then pressuring its insureds  their witnesses and anyone else coming to their support while trying to intimidate judges and insurance commissioners  So who began all this  In May 2001 an insurance claimant and shareholder  Cesar Balbin stepped into the annual shareholders meetings  For the first time ever in the company s history  AIG was publicly accused of criminal and civil racketeering activities including  extortion  blackmale  claims fraud  theft of company equity  it took with it the chairman  billions of dollars and led to a greater transparency and fear that possibly contributed to inaction by many at AIG to participate in its typically less than legal and proper activities required to keep the company afloat
