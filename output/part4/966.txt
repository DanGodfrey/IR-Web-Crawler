Nervous system From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Nervous system The Human Nervous System  Latin systema nervosum Neuroscience portal The nervous system is an organ system containing a network of specialized cells called neurons that coordinate the actions of an animal and transmit signals between different parts of its body  In most animals the nervous system consists of two parts  central and peripheral  The central nervous system of vertebrates  such as humans  contains the brain  spinal cord  and retina  The peripheral nervous system consists of sensory neurons  clusters of neurons called ganglia  and nerves connecting them to each other and to the central nervous system  These regions are all interconnected by means of complex neural pathways  The enteric nervous system  a subsystem of the peripheral nervous system  has the capacity  even when severed from the rest of the nervous system through its primary connection by the vagus nerve  to function independently in controlling the gastrointestinal system  Neurons send signals to other cells as electrochemical waves travelling along thin fibers called axons  which cause chemicals called neurotransmitters to be released at junctions called synapses  A cell that receives a synaptic signal may be excited  inhibited  or otherwise modulated  Sensory neurons are activated by physical stimuli impinging on them  and send signals that inform the central nervous system of the state of the body and the external environment  Motor neurons  situated either in the central nervous system or in peripheral ganglia  connect the nervous system to muscles or other effector organs  Central neurons  which in vertebrates greatly outnumber the other types  make all of their input and output connections with other neurons  The interactions of all these types of neurons form neural circuits that generate an organism s perception of the world and determine its behavior  Along with neurons  the nervous system contains other specialized cells called glial cells  or simply glia   which provide structural and metabolic support  Nervous systems are found in most multicellular animals  but vary greatly in complexity  1 Sponges have no nervous system  although they have homologs of many genes that play crucial roles in nervous system function  and are capable of several whole body responses  including a primitive form of locomotion  Placozoans and mesozoans other simple animals that are not classified as part of the subkingdom Eumetazoa also have no nervous system  In Radiata  radially symmetric animals such as jellyfish  the nervous system consists of a simple nerve net  Bilateria  which include the great majority of vertebrates and invertebrates  all have a nervous system containing a brain  one central cord  or two running in parallel   and nerves  The size of the bilaterian nervous system ranges from a few hundred cells in the simplest worms  to on the order of 100 billion cells in humans  Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system  Contents 1 Structure 1 1 Cells 1 1 1 Neurons 1 1 2 Glial cells 1 2 Anatomy in vertebrates 1 3 Comparative anatomy and

which are cylindrical bundles of fibers that emanate from the brain and central cord  and branch repeatedly to innervate every part of the body  2  Nerves are large enough to have been recognized by the ancient Egyptians  Greeks  and Romans  3  but their internal structure was not understood until it became possible to examine them using a microscope  4  A microscopic examination shows that nerves consist primarily of the axons of neurons  along with a variety of membranes that wrap around them and segregate them into fascicles  The neurons that give rise to nerves do not lie entirely within the nerves themselves their cell bodies reside within the brain  central cord  or peripheral ganglia  2  All animals more advanced than sponges have nervous systems  However  even sponges  unicellular animals  and non animals such as slime molds have cell to cell signalling mechanisms that are precursors to those of neurons  5  In radially symmetric animals such as the jellyfish and hydra  the nervous system consists of a diffuse network of isolated cells  6  In bilaterian animals  which make up the great majority of existing species  the nervous system has a common structure that originated early in the Cambrian period  over 500 million years ago  7  Cells The nervous system contains two main categories or types of cells  neurons and glial cells  Neurons Structure of a typical neuron Neuron Dendrite Soma Axon Nucleus Node of Ranvier Axon terminal Schwann cell Myelin sheath The nervous system is defined by the presence of a special type of cell the neuron  sometimes called  neurone  or  nerve cell    2  Neurons can be distinguished from other cells in a number of ways  but their most fundamental property is that they communicate with other cells via synapses  which are membrane to membrane junctions containing molecular machinery that allows rapid transmission of signals  either electrical or chemical  2  Many types of neuron possess an axon  a protoplasmic protrusion that can extend to distant parts of the body and make thousands of synaptic contacts  8  Axons frequently travel through the body in bundles called nerves  Even in the nervous system of a single species such as humans  hundreds of different types of neurons exist  with a wide variety of morphologies and functions  8  These include sensory neurons that transmute physical stimuli such as light and sound into neural signals  and motor neurons that transmute neural signals into activation of muscles or glands  however in many species the great majority of neurons receive all of their input from other neurons and send their output to other neurons  2  Glial cells Glial cells  named from the Greek for  glue   are non neuronal cells that provide support and nutrition  maintain homeostasis  form myelin  and participate in signal transmission in the nervous system  9  In the human brain  it is estimated that the total number of glia roughly equals the number of neurons  although the proportions vary in different brain areas  10  Among the most important functions of glial cells are to support neurons and hold them in place  to supply nutrients to neurons  to insulate neurons electrically  to destroy pathogens and remove dead neurons  and to provide guidance cues directing the axons of neurons to their targets  9  A very important type of glial cell  oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system  and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system  generates layers of a fatty substance called myelin that wraps around axons and provides electrical insulation which allows them to transmit action potentials much more rapidly and efficiently  Anatomy in vertebrates This section requires expansion  Diagram showing the major divisions of the vertebrate nervous system  The nervous system of vertebrate animals  including humans  is divided into the central nervous system  CNS  and peripheral nervous system  PNS   11  The central nervous system  CNS  is the largest part  and includes the brain and spinal cord  11  The spinal cavity contains the spinal cord  while the head contains the brain  The CNS is enclosed and protected by meninges  a three layered system of membranes  including a tough  leathery outer layer called the dura mater  The brain is also protected by the skull  and the spinal cord by the vertebrae  The peripheral nervous system  PNS  is a collective term for the nervous system structures that do not lie within the CNS  12  The large majority of the axon bundles called nerves are considered to belong to the PNS  even when the cell bodies of the neurons to which they belong reside within the brain or spinal cord  The PNS is divided into somatic and visceral parts  The somatic part consists of the nerves that innervate the skin  joints  and muscles  The cell bodies of somatic sensory neurons lie in dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord  The visceral part  also known as the autonomic nervous system  contains neurons that innervate the internal organs  blood vessels  and glands  The autonomic nervous system itself consists of two parts  the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system  Some authors also include sensory neurons whose cell bodies lie in the periphery  for senses such as hearing  as part of the PNS  others  however  omit them  13  Horizontal bisection of the head of an adult man  showing skin  skull  and brain with grey matter  brown in this image  and underlying white matter The vertebrate nervous system can also be divided into areas called grey matter   gray matter  in American spelling  and white matter  14  Grey matter  which is only grey in preserved tissue  and is better described as pink or light brown in living tissue  contains a high proportion of cell bodies of neurons  White matter is composed mainly of myelinated axons  and takes its color from the myelin  White matter includes all of the nerves  and much of the interior of the brain and spinal cord  Grey matter is found in clusters of neurons in the brain and spinal cord  and in cortical layers that line their surfaces  There is an anatomical convention that a cluster of neurons in the brain or spinal cord is called a nucleus  whereas a cluster of neurons in the periphery is called a ganglion  15  There are  however  a few exceptions to this rule  notably including the part of the forebrain called the basal ganglia  16  Comparative anatomy and evolution Main article  Evolution of nervous systems Neural precursors in sponges Sponges have no cells connected to each other by synaptic junctions  that is  no neurons  and therefore no nervous system  They do  however  have homologs of many genes that play key roles in synaptic function  Recent studies have shown that sponge cells express a group of proteins that cluster together to form a structure resembling a postsynaptic density  the signal receiving part of a synapse   5  However  the function of this structure is currently unclear  Although sponge cells do not show synaptic transmission  they do communicate with each other via calcium waves and other impulses  which mediate some simple actions such as whole body contraction  17  Radiata Jellyfish  comb jellies  and related animals have diffuse nerve nets rather than a central nervous system  In most jellyfish the nerve net is spread more or less evenly across the body  in comb jellies it is concentrated near the mouth  The nerve nets consist of sensory neurons that pick up chemical  tactile  and visual signals  motor neurons that can activate contractions of the body wall  and intermediate neurons that detect patterns of activity in the sensory neurons and send signals to groups of motor neurons as a result  In some cases groups of intermediate neurons are clustered into discrete ganglia  6  The development of the nervous system in radiata is relatively unstructured  Unlike bilaterians  radiata only have two primordial cell layers  endoderm and ectoderm  Neurons are generated from a special set of ectodermal precursor cells  which also serve as precursors for every other ectodermal cell type  18  Bilateria Nervous system of a bilaterian animal  in the form of a nerve cord with segmental enlargements  and a  brain  at the front The vast majority of existing animals are bilaterians  meaning animals with left and right sides that are approximate mirror images of each other  All bilateria are thought to have descended from a common wormlike ancestor that appeared in the Cambrian period  550 600 million years ago  7  The fundamental bilaterian body form is a tube with a hollow gut cavity running from mouth to anus  and a nerve cord with an enlargement  a  ganglion   for each body segment  with an especially large ganglion at the front  called the  brain   Area of the human body surface innervated by each spinal nerve Even mammals  including humans  show the segmented bilaterian body plan at the level of the nervous system  The spinal cord contains a series of segmental ganglia  each giving rise to motor and sensory nerves that innervate a portion of the body surface and underlying musculature  On the limbs  the layout of the innervation pattern is complex  but on the trunk it gives rise to a series of narrow bands  The top three segments belong to the brain  giving rise to the forebrain  midbrain  and hindbrain  19  Bilaterians can be divided  based on events that occur very early in embryonic development  into two groups  superphyla  called protostomes and deuterostomes  20  Deuterostomes include vertebrates as well as echinoderms  hemichordates  mainly acorn worms   and Xenoturbellidans  21  Protostomes  the more diverse group  include arthropods  molluscs  and numerous types of worms  There is a basic difference between the two groups in the placement of the nervous system within the body  protostomes possess a nerve cord on the ventral  usually bottom  side of the body  whereas in deuterostomes the nerve cord is on the dorsal  usually top  side  In fact  numerous aspects of the body are inverted between the two groups  including the expression patterns of several genes that show dorsal to ventral gradients  Most anatomists now consider that the bodies of protostomes and deuterostomes are  flipped over  with respect to each other  a hypothesis that was first proposed by Geoffroy Saint Hilaire for insects in comparison to vertebrates  Thus insects  for example  have nerve cords that run along the ventral midline of the body  while all vertebrates have spinal cords that run along the dorsal midline  22  Worms This section s factual accuracy is disputed  Please help to ensure that disputed facts are reliably sourced  See the relevant discussion on the talk page   May 2010  Earthworm nervous system  Top  side view of the front of the worm  Bottom  nervous system in isolation  viewed from above Worms are the simplest bilaterian animals  and reveal the basic structure of the bilaterian nervous system in the most straightforward way  As an example  earthworms have dual nerve cords running along the length of the body and merging at the tail and the mouth  These nerve cords are connected by transverse nerves like the rungs of a ladder  These transverse nerves help coordinate the two sides of the animal  Two ganglia at the head end function similar to a simple brain  Photoreceptors on the animal s eyespots provide sensory information on light and dark  23  The nervous system of one very small worm  the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans  has been mapped out down to the synaptic level  Every neuron and its cellular lineage has been recorded and most  if not all  of the neural connections are known  In this species  the nervous system is sexually dimorphic  the nervous systems of the two sexes  males and hermaphrodites  have different numbers of neurons and groups of neurons that perform sex specific functions  In C  elegans  males have exactly 383 neurons  while hermaphrodites have exactly 302 neurons  24  Arthropods Internal anatomy of a spider  showing the nervous system in blue Arthropods  such as insects and crustaceans  have a nervous system made up of a series of ganglia  connected by a ventral nerve cord made up of two parallel connectives running along the length of the belly  25  Typically  each body segment has one ganglion on each side  though some ganglia are fused to form the brain and other large ganglia  The head segment contains the brain  also known as the supraesophageal ganglion  In the insect nervous system  the brain is anatomically divided into the protocerebrum  deutocerebrum  and tritocerebrum  Immediately behind the brain is the subesophageal ganglion  which is composed of three pairs of fused ganglia  It controls the mouthparts  the salivary glands and certain muscles  Many arthropods have well developed sensory organs  including compound eyes for vision and antennae for olfaction and pheromone sensation  The sensory information from these organs is processed by the brain  In insects  many neurons have cell bodies that are positioned at the edge of the brain and are electrically passive the cell bodies serve only to provide metabolic support and do not participate in signalling  A protoplasmic fiber runs from the cell body and branches profusely  with some parts transmitting signals and other parts receiving signals  Thus  most parts of the insect brain have passive cell bodies arranged around the periphery  while the neural signal processing takes place in a tangle of protoplasmic fibers called neuropil  in the interior  26   Identified  neurons A neuron is called identified if it has properties that distinguish it from every other neuron in the same animal properties such as location  neurotransmitter  gene expression pattern  and connectivity and if every individual organism belonging to the same species has one and only one neuron with the same set of properties  27  In vertebrate nervous systems very few neurons are  identified  in this sense in humans  there are believed to be none but in simpler nervous systems  some or all neurons may be thus unique  In the roundworm C  elegans  whose nervous system is the most thoroughly described of any animal s  every neuron in the body is uniquely identifiable  with the same location and the same connections in every individual worm  One notable consequence of this fact is that the form of the C  elegans nervous system is completely specified by the genome  with no experience dependent plasticity  24  The brains of many molluscs and insects also contain substantial numbers of identified neurons  27  In vertebrates  the best known identified neurons are the gigantic Mauthner cells of fish  28  Every fish has two Mauthner cells  located in the bottom part of the brainstem  one on the left side and one on the right  Each Mauthner cell has an axon that crosses over  innervating neurons at the same brain level and then travelling down through the spinal cord  making numerous connections as it goes  The synapses generated by a Mauthner cell are so powerful that a single action potential gives rise to a major behavioral response  within milliseconds the fish curves its body into a C shape  then straightens  thereby propelling itself rapidly forward  Functionally this is a fast escape response  triggered most easily by a strong sound wave or pressure wave impinging on the lateral line organ of the fish  Mauthner cells are not the only identified neurons in fish there are about 20 more types  including pairs of  Mauthner cell analogs  in each spinal segmental nucleus  Although a Mauthner cell is capable of bringing about an escape response all by itself  in the context of ordinary behavior other types of cells usually contribute to shaping the amplitude and direction of the response  Mauthner cells have been described as command neurons  A command neuron is a special type of identified neuron  defined as a neuron that is capable of driving a specific behavior all by itself  29  Such neurons appear most commonly in the fast escape systems of various species the squid giant axon and squid giant synapse  used for pioneering experiments in neurophysiology because of their enormous size  both participate in the fast escape circuit of the squid  The concept of a command neuron has  however  become controversial  because of studies showing that some neurons that initially appeared to fit the description were really only capable of evoking a response in a limited set of circumstances  30  Function At the most basic level  the function of the nervous system is to send signals from one cell to others  or from one part of the body to others  There are multiple ways that a cell can send signals to other cells  One is by releasing chemicals called hormones into the internal circulation  so that they can diffuse to distant sites  In contrast to this  broadcast  mode of signaling  the nervous system provides  point to point  signals neurons project their axons to specific target areas and make synaptic connections with specific target cells  31  Thus  neural signaling is capable of a much higher level of specificity than hormonal signaling  It is also much faster  the fastest nerve signals travel at speeds that exceed 100 meters per second  At a more integrative level  the primary function of the nervous system is to control the body  2  It does this by extracting information from the environment using sensory receptors  sending signals that encode this information into the central nervous system  processing the information to determine an appropriate response  and sending output signals to muscles or glands to activate the response  The evolution of a complex nervous system has made it possible for various animal species to have advanced perception abilities such as vision  complex social interactions  rapid coordination of organ systems  and integrated processing of concurrent signals  In humans  the sophistication of the nervous system makes it possible to have language  abstract representation of concepts  transmission of culture  and many other features of human society that would not exist without the human brain  Neurons and synapses Major elements in synaptic transmission  An electrochemical wave called an action potential travels along the axon of a neuron  When the wave reaches a synapse  it provokes release of a small amount of neurotransmitter molecules  which bind to chemical receptor molecules located in the membrane of the target cell  Most neurons send signals via their axons  although some types are capable of dendrite to dendrite communication   In fact  the types of neurons called amacrine cells have no axons  and communicate only via their dendrites   Neural signals propagate along an axon in the form of electrochemical waves called action potentials  which produce cell to cell signals at points where axon terminals make synaptic contact with other cells  32  Synapses may be electrical or chemical  Electrical synapses make direct electrical connections between neurons  33  but chemical synapses are much more common  and much more diverse in function  34  At a chemical synapse  the cell that sends signals is called presynaptic  and the cell that receives signals is called postsynaptic  Both the presynaptic and postsynaptic areas are full of molecular machinery that carries out the signalling process  The presynaptic area contains large numbers of tiny spherical vessels called synaptic vesicles  packed with neurotransmitter chemicals  32  When the presynaptic terminal is electrically stimulated  an array of molecules embedded in the membrane are activated  and cause the contents of the vesicles to be released into the narrow space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes  called the synaptic cleft  The neurotransmitter then binds to receptors embedded in the postsynaptic membrane  causing them to enter an activated state  34  Depending on the type of receptor  the resulting effect on the postsynaptic cell may be excitatory  inhibitory  or modulatory in more complex ways  For example  release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at a synaptic contact between a motor neuron and a muscle cell induces rapid contraction of the muscle cell  35  The entire synaptic transmission process takes only a fraction of a millisecond  although the effects on the postsynaptic cell may last much longer  even indefinitely  in cases where the synaptic signal leads to the formation of a memory trace   8  Structure of a typical chemical synapse Postsynaptic density Voltage  gated Ca   channel Synaptic vesicle Reuptake pump Receptor Neurotransmitter Axon terminal Synaptic cleft Dendrite There are literally hundreds of different types of synapses  In fact  there are over a hundred known neurotransmitters  and many of them have multiple types of receptors  36  Many synapses use more than one neurotransmitter a common arrangement is for a synapse to use one fast acting small molecule neurotransmitter such as glutamate or GABA  along with one or more peptide neurotransmitters that play slower acting modulatory roles  Molecular neuroscientists generally divide receptors into two broad groups  chemically gated ion channels and second messenger systems  When a chemically gated ion channel is activated  it forms a passage that allow specific types of ion to flow across the membrane  Depending on the type of ion  the effect on the target cell may be excitatory or inhibitory  When a second messenger system is activated  it starts a cascade of molecular interactions inside the target cell  which may ultimately produce a wide variety of complex effects  such as increasing or decreasing the sensitivity of the cell to stimuli  or even altering gene transcription  According to a rule called Dale s principle  which has only a few known exceptions  a neuron releases the same neurotransmitters at all of its synapses  37  This does not mean  though  that a neuron exerts the same effect on all of its targets  because the effect of a synapse depends not on the neurotransmitter  but on the receptors that it activates  34  Because different targets can  and frequently do  use different types of receptors  it is possible for a neuron to have excitatory effects on one set of target cells  inhibitory effects on others  and complex modulatory effects on others still  Nevertheless  it happens that the two most widely used neurotransmitters  glutamate and GABA  each have largely consistent effects  Glutamate has several widely occurring types of receptors  but all of them are excitatory or modulatory  Similarly  GABA has several widely occurring receptor types  but all of them are inhibitory  38  Because of this consistency  glutamatergic cells are frequently referred to as  excitatory neurons   and GABAergic cells as  inhibitory neurons   Strictly speaking this is an abuse of terminology it is the receptors that are excitatory and inhibitory  not the neurons but it is commonly seen even in scholarly publications  One very important subset of synapses are capable of forming memory traces by means of long lasting activity dependent changes in synaptic strength  39  The best known form of neural memory is a process called long term potentiation  abbreviated LTP   which operates at synapses that use the neurotransmitter glutamate acting on a special type of receptor known as the NMDA receptor  40  The NMDA receptor has an  associative  property  if the two cells involved in the synapse are both activated at approximately the same time  a channel opens that permits calcium to flow into the target cell  41  The calcium entry initiates a second messenger cascade that ultimately leads to an increase in the number of glutamate receptors in the target cell  thereby increasing the effective strength of the synapse  This change in strength can last for weeks or longer  Since the discovery of LTP in 1973  many other types of synaptic memory traces have been found  involving increases or decreases in synaptic strength that are induced by varying conditions  and last for variable periods of time  40 Reward learning  for example  depends on a variant form of LTP that is conditioned on an extra input coming from a reward signalling pathway that uses dopamine as neurotransmitter  42  All these forms of synaptic modifiability  taken collectively  give rise to neural plasticity  that is  to a capability for the nervous system to adapt itself to variations in the environment  Neural circuits and systems The basic neuronal function of sending signals to other cells includes a capability for neurons to exchange signals with each other  Networks formed by interconnected groups of neurons are capable of a wide variety of functions  including feature detection  pattern generation  and timing  43  In fact  it is difficult to assign limits to the types of information processing that can be carried out by neural networks  Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts showed in 1943 that even networks formed from a greatly simplified mathematical abstraction of a neuron are capable of universal computation  44  Given that individual neurons can generate complex temporal patterns of activity all by themselves  the range of capabilities possible for even small groups of interconnected neurons are beyond current understanding  43  Illustration of pain pathway  from Ren  Descartes s Treatise of Man Historically  for many years the predominant view of the function of the nervous system was as a stimulus response associator  45  In this conception  neural processing begins with stimuli that activate sensory neurons  producing signals that propagate through chains of connections in the spinal cord and brain  giving rise eventually to activation of motor neurons and thereby to muscle contraction  i e   to overt responses  Descartes believed that all of the behaviors of animals  and most of the behaviors of humans  could be explained in terms of stimulus response circuits  although he also believed that higher cognitive functions such as language were not capable of being explained mechanistically  46 Charles Sherrington  in his influential 1906 book The Integrative Action of the Nervous System  45  developed the concept of stimulus response mechanisms in much more detail  and Behaviorism  the school of thought that dominated Psychology through the middle of the 20th century  attempted to explain every aspect of human behavior in stimulus response terms  47  However  experimental studies of electrophysiology  beginning in the early 20th century and reaching high productivity by the 1940s  showed that the nervous system contains many mechanisms for generating patterns of activity intrinsically  without requiring an external stimulus  48  Neurons were found to be capable of producing regular sequences of action potentials  or sequences of bursts  even in complete isolation  49  When intrinsically active neurons are connected to each other in complex circuits  the possibilities for generating intricate temporal patterns become far more extensive  43  A modern conception views the function of the nervous system partly in terms of stimulus response chains  and partly in terms of intrinsically generated activity patterns both types of activity interact with each other to generate the full repertoire of behavior  50  Reflexes and other stimulus response circuits Simplified schema of basic nervous system function  signals are picked up by sensory receptors and sent to the spinal cord and brain  where processing occurs that results in signals sent back to the spinal cord and then out to motor neurons The simplest type of neural circuit is a reflex arc  which begins with a sensory input and ends with a motor output  passing through a sequence of neurons in between  51  For example  consider the  withdrawal reflex  causing the hand to jerk back after a hot stove is touched  The circuit begins with sensory receptors in the skin that are activated by harmful levels of heat  a special type of molecular structure embedded in the membrane causes heat to change the electrical field across the membrane  If the change in electrical potential is large enough  it evokes an action potential  which is transmitted along the axon of the receptor cell  into the spinal cord  There the axon makes excitatory synaptic contacts with other cells  some of which project  send axonal output  to the same region of the spinal cord  others projecting into the brain  One target is a set of spinal interneurons that project to motor neurons controlling the arm muscles  The interneurons excite the motor neurons  and if the excitation is strong enough  some of the motor neurons generate action potentials  which travel down their axons to the point where they make excitatory synaptic contacts with muscle cells  The excitatory signals induce contraction of the muscle cells  which causes the joint angles in the arm to change  pulling the arm away  In reality  this straightfoward schema is subject to numerous complications  51  Although for the simplest reflexes there are short neural paths from sensory neuron to motor neuron  there are also other nearby neurons that participate in the circuit and modulate the response  Furthermore  there are projections from the brain to the spinal cord that are capable of enhancing or inhibiting the reflex  Although the simplest reflexes may be mediated by circuits lying entirely within the spinal cord  more complex responses rely on signal processing in the brain  52  Consider  for example  what happens when an object in the periphery of the visual field moves  and a person looks toward it  The initial sensory response  in the retina of the eye  and the final motor response  in the oculomotor nuclei of the brain stem  are not all that different from those in a simple reflex  but the intermediate stages are completely different  Instead of a one or two step chain of processing  the visual signals pass through perhaps a dozen stages of integration  involving the thalamus  cerebral cortex  basal ganglia  superior colliculus  cerebellum  and several brainstem nuclei  These areas perform signal processing functions that include feature detection  perceptual analysis  memory recall  decision making  and motor planning  53  Feature detection is the ability to extract biologically relevant information from combinations of sensory signals  54  In the visual system  for example  sensory receptors in the retina of the eye are only individually capable of detecting  points of light  in the outside world  55  Second level visual neurons receive input from groups of primary receptors  higher level neurons receive input from groups of second level neurons  and so on  forming a hierarchy of processing stages  At each stage  important information is extracted from the signal ensemble and unimportant information is discarded  By the end of the process  input signals representing  points of light  have been transformed into a neural representation of objects in the surrounding world and their properties  The most sophisticated sensory processing occurs inside the brain  but complex feature extraction also takes place in the spinal cord and in peripheral sensory organs such as the retina  Intrinsic pattern generation Although stimulus response mechanisms are the easiest to understand  the nervous system is also capable of controlling the body in ways that do not require an external stimulus  by means of internally generated rhythms of activity  Because of the variety of voltage sensitive ion channels that can be embedded in the membrane of a neuron  many types of neurons are capable  even in isolation  of generating rhythmic sequences of action potentials  or rhythmic alternations between high rate bursting and quiescence  When neurons that are intrinsically rhythmic are connected to each other by excitatory or inhibitory synapses  the resulting networks are capable of a wide variety of dynamical behaviors  including attractor dynamics  periodicity  and even chaos  A network of neurons that uses its internal structure to generate temporally structured output  without requiring a corresponding temporally structured stimulus  is called a central pattern generator  Internal pattern generation operates on a wide range of time scales  from milliseconds to hours or longer  One of the most important types of temporal pattern is circadian rhythmicity that is  rhythmicity with a period of approximately 24 hours  All animals that have been studied show circadian fluctuations in neural activity  which control circadian alternations in behavior such as the sleep wake cycle  Experimental studies dating from the 1990s have shown that circadian rhythms are generated by a  genetic clock  consisting of a special set of genes whose expression level rises and falls over the course of the day  Animals as diverse as insects and vertebrates share a similar genetic clock system  The circadian clock is influenced by light but continues to operate even when light levels are held constant and no other external time of day cues are available  The clock genes are expressed in many parts of the nervous system as well as many peripheral organs  but in mammals all of these  tissue clocks  are kept in synchrony by signals that emanate from a master timekeeper in a tiny part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus  Development In vertebrates  landmarks of embryonic neural development include the birth and differentiation of neurons from stem cell precursors  the migration of immature neurons from their birthplaces in the embryo to their final positions  outgrowth of axons from neurons and guidance of the motile growth cone through the embryo towards postsynaptic partners  the generation of synapses between these axons and their postsynaptic partners  and finally the lifelong changes in synapses which are thought to underlie learning and memory  56  All bilaterian animals at an early stage of development form a gastrula  which is polarized  with one end called the animal pole and the other the vegetal pole  The gastrula has the shape of a disk with three layers of cells  an inner layer called the endoderm  which gives rise to the lining of most internal organs  a middle layer called the mesoderm  which gives rise to the bones and muscles  and an outer layer called the ectoderm  which gives rise to the skin and nervous system  57  Human embryo  showing neural groove Four stages in the development of the neural tube in the human embryo In vertebrates  the first sign of the nervous system is the appearance of a thin strip of cells along the center of the back  called the neural plate  The inner portion of the neural plate  along the midline  is destined to become the central nervous system  CNS   the outer portion the peripheral nervous system  PNS   As development proceeds  a fold called the neural groove appears along the midline  This fold deepens  and then closes up at the top  At this point the future CNS appears as a cylindrical structure called the neural tube  whereas the future PNS appears as two strips of tissue called the neural crest  running lengthwise above the neural tube  The sequence of stages from neural plate to neural tube and neural crest is known as neurulation  In the early 20th century  a set of famous experiments by Hans Spemann and Hilde Mangold showed that the formation of nervous tissue is  induced  by signals from a group of mesodermal cells called the organizer region  56  For decades  though  the nature of the induction process defeated every attempt to figure it out  until finally it was resolved by genetic approaches in the 1990s  Induction of neural tissue requires inhibition of the gene for a so called bone morphogenetic protein  or BMP  Specifically the protein BMP4 appears to be involved  Two proteins called Noggin and Chordin  both secreted by the mesoderm  are capable of inhibiting BMP4 and thereby inducing ectoderm to turn into neural tissue  It appears that a similar molecular mechanism is involved for widely disparate types of animals  including arthropods as well as vertebrates  In some animals  however  another type of molecule called Fibroblast Growth Factor or FGF may also play an important role in induction  Induction of neural tissues causes formation of neural precursor cells  called neuroblasts  58  In drosophila  neuroblasts divide asymmetrically  so that one product is a  ganglion mother cell   GMC   and the other is a neuroblast  A GMC divides once  to give rise to either a pair of neurons or a pair of glial cells  In all  a neuroblast is capable of generating an indefinite number of neurons or glia  As shown in a 2008 study  one factor common to all bilateral organisms  including humans  is a family of secreted signaling molecules called neurotrophins which regulate the growth and survival of neurons  59  Zhu et al  identified DNT1  the first neurotrophin found in flies  DNT1 shares structural similarity with all known neurotrophins and is a key factor in the fate of neurons in Drosophila  Because neurotrophins have now been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrates  this evidence suggests that neurotrophins were present in an ancestor common to bilateral organisms and may represent a common mechanism for nervous system formation  Pathology Main article  Neurology See also  Psychiatry The nervous system is susceptible to malfunction in a wide variety of ways  as a result of genetic defects  physical damage due to trauma or poison  infection  or simply aging  The medical specialty of neurology studies the causes of nervous system malfunction  and looks for interventions that can alleviate it  The central nervous system is protected by major physical and chemical barriers  Physically  the brain and spinal cord are surrounded by tough meningeal membranes  and enclosed in the bones of the skull and spinal vertebrae  which combine to form a strong physical shield  Chemically  the brain and spinal cord are isolated by the so called blood brain barrier  which prevents most types of chemicals from moving from the bloodstream into the interior of the CNS  These protections make the CNS less susceptible in many ways than the PNS  the flip side  however  is that damage to the CNS tends to have more serious consequences  Although nerves tend to lie deep under the skin except in a few places such as the ulnar nerve near the elbow joint  they are still relatively exposed to physical damage  which can cause pain  loss of sensation  or loss of muscle control  Damage to nerves can also be caused by swelling or bruises at places where a nerve passes through a tight bony channel  as happens in carpal tunnel syndrome  If a nerve is completely transected  it will often regenerate  but for long nerves this process may take months to complete  In addition to physical damage  peripheral neuropathy may be caused by many other medical problems  including genetic conditions  metabolic conditions such as diabetes  inflammatory conditions such as Guillain Barr  syndrome  vitamin deficiency  infectious diseases such as leprosy or shingles  or poisoning by toxins such as heavy metals  Many cases have no cause that can be identified  and are referred to as idiopathic  It is also possible for nerves to lose function temporarily  resulting in numbness as stiffness common causes include mechanical pressure  a drop in temperature  or chemical interactions with local anesthetic drugs such as lidocaine  Physical damage to the spinal cord may result in loss of sensation or movement  If an injury to the spine produces nothing worse than swelling  the symptoms may be transient  but if nerve fibers in the spine are actually destroyed  the loss of function is usually permanent  Experimental studies have shown that spinal nerve fibers attempt to regrow in the same way as nerve fibers  but in the spinal cord  tissue destruction usually produces scar tissue that cannot be penetrated by the regrowing nerves  References    Nervous System   Columbia Encyclopedia
