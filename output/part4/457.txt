mi  in length and as much as 23 kilometres  14 mi  in width  amounting to 431 square kilometres  166 sq mi   It is situated in the western area of the North Atlantic and 100 kilometres  62 mi  east of the Windward Islands and the Caribbean Sea  6  therein  it is about 168 kilometres  104 mi  east of the islands of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  and 400 kilometres  250 mi  north east of Trinidad and Tobago  Barbados is outside of the principal Atlantic hurricane belt  Barbados was initially visited by the Spanish around the late 1400s to early 1500s and first appears on a Spanish map from 1511  7  The Spanish explorers may have plundered the island of whatever native peoples resided therein to become slaves  7  Thereafter  the Portuguese in 1536 then visited  but they too left it unclaimed  with their only remnants being an introduction of wild hogs for a good supply of meat whenever the island was visited  The first English ship  the Olive Blossom  arrived in Barbados in 1624  They took possession of it in the name of  James I  King of England   Two years later in 1627 the first permanent settlers arrived from England and it became an English and later British colony  8

Videography 16 External links  edit  Etymology According to accounts by descendants of the indigenous Arawakan speaking tribes in other regional areas  the original name for Barbados was Ichirouganaim  with possible translations including  Red Land with White Teeth   13   Redstone island with teeth outside  reefs    14  or simply  Teeth   15  16  17  The reason for the later name Barbados is controversial  According to some sources The Portuguese  en route to Brazil  18  19  were the first Europeans to come upon the island  while others say it was the Spanish which gave the Spanish name  Los Barbudos   The word Barbados means  bearded ones   but it is a matter of conjecture whether  bearded  refers to the long  hanging roots of the bearded fig tree  Ficus citrifolia   indigenous to the island  to allegedly bearded Caribs once inhabiting the island  or  more fancifully  to the foam spraying over the outlying reefs giving the impression of a beard  In 1519  a map produced by the Genoese mapmaker Visconte Maggiolo showed and named Barbados in its correct position  Furthermore  an island in the Leewards which is very close in name to Barbados is Barbuda and was once named Las Barbudas by the Spanish  Other names or nicknames associated with Barbados include  Bim  and  Bimshire   The origin is uncertain but several theories exist  The National Cultural Foundation of Barbados says that  Bim  was a word commonly used by slaves and that it derives from the phrase  bi mu  or either   bem    Ndi bem    Nwanyi ibem  or  Nwoke ibem   20  from an Igbo phrase meaning  my people   In colloquial or literary contexts   Bim  can also take a more deific tone  referring to the  goddess  Barbados  citation needed  The word Bim and Bimshire are recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary and Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionaries  Another possible source for  Bim  is reported to be in the Agricultural Reporter of 25 April 1868  The Rev  N Greenidge  father of one of the island s most famous scholars  Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge  suggested the listing of Bimshire as a county of England  Expressly named were  Wiltshire  Hampshire  Berkshire and Bimshire   20  Lastly in the Daily Argosy  of Demerara  i e  Guyana  of 1652 it referred to Bim as a possible corruption of the word  Byam   who was a Royalist leader against the Parliamentarians  That source suggested the followers of Byam became known as Bims and became a word for all Barbadians  20   edit  History Main articles  History of Barbados and Timeline of Barbadian history Amerindian settlement of Barbados dates to about the 4th to 7th century AD  by a group known as the Saladoid Barrancoid  21  In the 13th century  the Caribs arrived from South America  22  The Spanish and Portuguese briefly claimed Barbados from the late 16th to the 17th centuries  and may have seized the Arawaks on Barbados and used them as slave labour  Other Arawaks are believed to have fled to neighbouring islands  Apart from possibly displacing the Caribs  the Spanish and Portuguese left little impact and left the island uninhabited  Some Arawaks migrated from Guyana in the 1800s and continue to live in Barbados  22  23  24  From the arrival of the first English settlers in 1627 1628 until independence in 1966  Barbados was under uninterrupted British governance  and was the only Caribbean island that did not change hands during the colonial period   In the very early years  the majority of the population was white and male  with African slaves providing little of the workforce  Cultivation of tobacco  cotton  ginger and indigo was handled primarily by European indentured labour until the start of the sugar cane industry in the 1640s  As Barbados  economy grew  Barbados developed a large measure of local autonomy through its founding as a proprietary colony  Its House of Assembly began meeting in 1639  Among the initial important figures was Anglo Dutchman Sir William Courten   edit  Government and politics Parliament Building  Main articles  Government of Barbados and Politics of Barbados Barbados has been an independent country since 30 November 1966  It functions as a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy  modelled on the British Westminster system  with Elizabeth II  Queen of Barbados  as head of state represented locally by the Governor General  Elliot Belgrave and the Prime Minister as the head of the government  The number of representatives within the House of Assembly has gradually increased from twenty four at independence  to its present composition of thirty seats  During the 1990s  at the suggestion of Trinidad and Tobago s Patrick Manning  Barbados attempted a political union with Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana  The project stalled after the then Prime Minister of Barbados Lloyd Erskine Sandiford became ill and his party  the Democratic Labour Party  lost the next general election  25  26  Barbados continues to share close ties with Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana  claiming the highest number of Guyanese immigrants after the United States  Canada and the United Kingdom  Barbados functions as a two party system  the two dominant parties being the ruling Democratic Labour Party and the opposition  Barbados Labour Party  Until 2003  each party had served two terms in office alternately  27  The election of 2003 gave the BLP a third term victory  at which time the Barbados Labour Party  BLP  achieved being in government for 14 years   1994 until the 2008 elections   Under that administration  the former Prime Minister  The Right Honourable Owen S  Arthur acted as the Regional Leader of the CSM  Caribbean Single Market   The Honourable David Thompson  who was elected Prime Minister of Barbados in 2008  died of pancreatic cancer on 23 October 2010  He was succeeded by Deputy Prime Minister Freundel Stuart  who was sworn in the same day  28  29  Barbados has had several third parties over a period of time since independence  The People s Pressure Movement formed in the early 1970s and contested the 1976 elections  The National Democratic Party  which contested the 1994 elections  and the People s Democratic Congress  which contested the 2008 elections  Apart from these there were several independents who contested the elections  but independents are yet to win a seat in Parliament   edit  Law The Constitution of Barbados is the supreme law of the nation  30  The Attorney General heads the independent judiciary  Historically  Barbadian law was based entirely on English common law with a few local adaptations  At the time of independence  the British Parliament ceased having the ability to change local legislation at its own discretion  British law and various legal statutes within British law at this time  and other prior measures adopted by the Barbadian parliament became the basis of the modern day law system  More recently  however  local Barbadian legislation may be shaped or influenced by such organisations as the United Nations  the Organization of American States  or other international fora to which Barbados has obligatory commitments by treaty  Additionally  through international cooperation  other institutions may supply the Barbados Parliament with key sample legislation to be adapted to meet local circumstances before crafting it as local law  Laws are passed by the Barbadian Parliament  whereby upon their passage  are given official vice regal assent by the Governor General to become law  In Barbados  camouflage clothing is reserved for military use and forbidden for civilians to wear  including children  5  As of October 2010  it is illegal for persons to smoke in public areas   edit  Judiciary Main article  Judiciary of Barbados The local court system of Barbados is made up of  Magistrates  Courts  Covering Criminal  Civil  Domestic  Domestic Violence  and Juvenile matters  But can also take up matters dealing with Corornor s Inquests  Liquor Licences  and civil marriages  Further  the Magistrates  Courts deal with Contract and Tort law where claims do not exceed  10 000 00  31  The Supreme Court  is made up of High Court and Court

in Port Of Spain  Trinidad and Tobago   is the court of last resort  final jurisdiction  over Barbadian law  It replaced the London based Judicial Committee of the Privy Council  JCPC   The CCJ may resolve other disputed matters dealing with the Caribbean  CARICOM  Single Market and Economy  CSME    edit  Foreign relations Main article  Foreign relations of Barbados Barbados is a full and participating member of the Caribbean Community  CARICOM   Caribbean Single Market and Economy  CSME   and the Association of Caribbean States  ACS   32 Organization of American States  OAS   Commonwealth of Nations  and the Caribbean Court of Justice  CCJ   which currently pertains only to Barbados  Belize and Guyana  In 2001 the Caribbean Community heads of government voted on a measure declaring that the region should work towards replacing the UK s Judicial Committee of the Privy Council with the Caribbean Court of Justice  Barbados is an original Member  1995  of the World Trade Organisation  WTO   and participates actively in its work  It grants at least MFN treatment to all its trading partners  As of December 2007  Barbados is linked by an Economic Partnership Agreement with the European Commission  The pact involves the Caribbean Forum  CARIFORUM  subgroup of the Group of African  Caribbean  and Pacific states  ACP   CARIFORUM presently the only part of the wider ACP bloc that has concluded the full regional trade pact with the European Union  Trade policy has also sought to protect a small number of domestic activities  mostly food production  from foreign competition  while recognising that most domestic needs are best met by imports   edit  Military This section requires expansion  The Barbados Defence Force has roughly 600 members  within it  12 to 18 year old youngsters make up the Barbados Cadet Corps   edit  Geography and climate Main article  Geography and climate of Barbados Map of Barbados Beach near Bridgetown  Barbados  Barbados is the easternmost island in the Lesser Antilles  It is flat in comparison to its island neighbours to the west  the Windward Islands  The island rises gently to the central highland region  with the highpoint of the nation being Mount Hillaby  in the Scotland District  340 metres  1 120 ft  above sea level  The island is situated in the Atlantic Ocean  east of the other West Indies Islands  In the parish of Saint Michael lies Barbados  capital and main city  Bridgetown  Other major towns scattered across the island include Holetown  in the parish of Saint James  Oistins  in the parish of Christ Church  and Speightstown  in the parish of Saint Peter   edit  Geology Barbados lies on the boundary of the South American and the Caribbean Plates  33  The shift of the South American plate beneath the Caribbean plate scrapes sediment from the South American plate and deposits it above the subduction zone forming an accretionary prism  The rate of this depositing of material allows Barbados to rise at a rate of about 25 millimetres  0 98 in  per 1 000 years  34  This subduction means geologically the island is composed of coral roughly  90 m 300 ft thick   where reefs formed above the sediment  The land slopes in a series of  terraces  in the west and goes into an incline in the east  A large proportion of the island is circled by coral reefs  The erosion of limestone rock in the North East of the island  in the Scotland District has resulted in the formation of various caves and gullys  some of which have become popular tourist attractions such as Harrison s Cave and Welchman Hall Gully  On the Atlantic East coast of the island coastal landforms including stacks have been created due to the limestone composition of the area   edit  Climate The country is generally split into a period of two seasons one of which includes noticeably higher rainfall  Known as the  wet season   this period runs from March November  In contrast  the  dry season  runs December May  The annual precipitation ranges between 40 inches  1 000 mm  and 90 inches  2 300 mm   From December May the average temperatures range from 21 to 31  C  70 to 88  F   while between June November  they range from 23 to 31  C  73 to 88  F   35  On the K ppen climate classification scale  much of Barbados is regarded as a Tropical monsoon climate  Am   However  gentle breezes of 12 16 kilometres per hour  8 10 mph  abound throughout the year and give Barbados a warm climate which is moderately tropical  Infrequent natural hazards include  earthquakes  landslips  and hurricanes  Barbados is often spared the worst effects of the region s tropical storms and hurricanes during the rainy season  The far eastern location in the Atlantic Ocean puts the country just outside the principal hurricane strike zone  On average  a major hurricane strikes about once every 26 years  The last significant hit from a hurricane to cause severe damage to Barbados was Hurricane Janet in 1955  and more recently in 2010 the island was struck by Hurricane Tomas  but this only caused minor damage across the country  36   edit  Environmental issues The island is susceptible to environmental pressures  As one of the world s most densely populated isles  the government worked during the 1990s 37  to aggressively integrate the growing south coast of the island into the Bridgetown Sewage Treatment Plant to reduce contamination of offshore coral reefs  38  39  As of the 2000s  a second treatment plant has been proposed along the islands  west coast  With such a dense populus  Barbados has placed large efforts on protecting its underground aquifers  As a coral limestone island  Barbados is highly permeable to seepage of surface water into the earth  As such  a major emphasis by the government has been placed on protecting the catchment areas  in specific surface areas known as buffer zones  that lead directly into the huge network of underground aquifers and streams  40  On occasion illegal squatters have breached these areas  and the government has removed squatters in order to preserve the cleanliness of the underground springs for islands drinking water  41  The government has placed a huge emphasis on keeping Barbados clean with the aim of protecting the environment and preserving offshore coral reefs which surround the island  Many initiatives to mitigate human pressures on the coastal regions of Barbados and seas is the Coastal Zone Management Unit  CZMU   42  Barbados has nearly 90 km of coral reefs just offshore and two protected marine parks have been established off the west coast  43  Over fishing is another threat which faces Barbados  44  Barbados is host to four species of nesting turtles  green turtles  loggerheads  and leatherbacks  and has the second largest hawksbill turtle breeding population in the Caribbean  45  The driving of vehicles on beaches can crush nests buried in the sand and such activity should be avoided in nesting areas  46  Though on the opposite side of the Atlantic  and some 3000 miles west of Africa  Barbados is one of many places in the American continent which experiences heightened levels of mineral dust from the Sahara Desert  47  Some particularly intense dust episodes have been blamed partly for the impacts on the health of coral reefs 48  surrounding Barbados or asthmatic episodes  49  but evidence has not wholly supported the former such claim  50   edit  Administrative divisions Main article  Parishes of Barbados Map of the parishes of Barbados Barbados is divided into 11 parishes  Christ Church Saint Andrew Saint George Saint James Saint John Saint Joseph Saint Lucy Saint Michael Saint Peter Saint Philip Saint Thomas St  George and St  Thomas located in the middle of the country are the only two parishes without coastlines   edit  Economy Main article  Economy of Barbados Barbados is the 51st richest country in the world in terms of

High income economies of the world  51  Historically  the economy of Barbados had been dependent on sugarcane cultivation and related activities  but in the late 1970s and early 1980s it has diversified into the manufacturing and tourism sectors  Offshore finance and information services have become important foreign exchange earners  and there is a healthy light manufacturing sector  Since the 1990s the Barbados Government has been seen as business friendly and economically sound  citation needed  The island has seen a construction boom  with the development and redevelopment of hotels  office complexes  and homes  citation needed  Recent government administrations have continued efforts to reduce unemployment  encourage foreign direct investment  and privatise remaining state owned enterprises  Unemployment has been reduced to 10 7 in 2003  2  The economy contracted in 2001 and 2002 due to slowdowns in tourism  consumer spending and the impact of the 11 September 2001 attacks  but rebounded in 2003 and has shown growth since 2004  2  Traditional trading partners include Canada  the Caribbean Community  especially Trinidad and Tobago   the United Kingdom and the United States  Business links and investment flows have become substantial  as of 2003 the island saw from Canada CA  25 billion in investment holdings  placing it as one of Canada s top five destinations for Canadian foreign direct investment  FDI   Businessman Eugene Melnyk of Toronto  Canada  is said to be Barbados  richest permanent resident  citation needed  It has been reported that the year 2006 would have been one of the busiest years for building construction ever in Barbados  as the building boom on the island entered the final stages for several multi million dollar commercial projects  52  The European Union is presently assisting Barbados with a  10 million programme of modernisation of the country s International Business and Financial Services Sector  53

Bajans  and refer to each other as such  The biggest communities outside the Afro Caribbean community are  The Indo Guyanese  an important part of the economy due to the increase of immigrants from partner country Guyana  There are reports of a growing Indo Bajan diaspora originating from Guyana and India  They introduced roti and other Indian dishes to Barbados  culture  Mostly from southern India and Hindu states  they are growing in size but smaller than the equivalent communities in Trinidad  amp  Guyana  Euro Bajans  4  of the population  2  have settled in Barbados since the 16th

regional variant of English  referred to locally as Bajan  is spoken by most Barbadians in everyday life  especially in informal settings  In its full fledged form  Bajan sounds markedly different from the Standard English heard on the island  The degree of intelligibility between Bajan and general English changes depending on the speakers  origins and the  rawness  of one s accent  In rare instances  a Bajan speaker may be completely unintelligible to an outside English speaker if sufficient slang terminology is present in a sentence  Bajan is somewhat differentiated from  but highly influenced by other Caribbean English dialects  it is a fusion of British English and elements borrowed from the languages of West Africa  Hindi and Bhojpuri are also spoken on the island by a small

example of this is the island s national sport  cricket  Barbados has brought forth several great cricketers  including Sir Garfield Sobers and Frank Worrell  Citizens are officially called Barbadians  The term  Bajan   pronounced  beijan  may have come from a localised pronunciation of the word Barbadian which at times can sound more like  Bar bajan   The largest carnival like cultural event which takes place on the island is the Crop Over festival  As in many other Caribbean and Latin American countries  Crop Over is an important event for many people on the island  as well as the thousands of

Geographical Institute  and visitors can see a  map  of the dating work in the bar and restaurant  The cave now stands some six feet above the high tide mark even though it was formed at sea level
