Telepresence From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search A Teliris VL Executive telepresence system in 2007 Telepresence refers to a set of technologies which allow a person to feel as if they were present  to give the appearance of being present  or to have an effect  via telerobotics  at a place other than their true location  Telepresence requires that the users  senses be provided with such stimuli as to give the feeling of being in that other location  Additionally  users may be given the ability to affect the remote location  In this case  the user s position  movements  actions  voice  etc  may be sensed  transmitted and duplicated in the remote location to bring about this effect  Therefore information may be traveling in both directions between the user and the remote location  A popular application is found in telepresence videoconferencing  the highest possible level of videotelephony  Telepresence via video deploys greater technical sophistication and improved fidelity of both sight and sound than in traditional videoconferencing  Technical advancements in mobile collaboration have also extended the capabilities of videoconferencing beyond the boardroom for use with hand held mobile devices  enabling collaboration independent of location  Contents 1 History 2 Benefits 3 Implementation 3 1 Implementation of human sensory elements 3 1 1

article by Marvin Minsky  who outlined his vision for an adapted version of the older concept of teleoperation that focused on giving the remote participation a feeling of actually being present  1  A science fiction entitled Waldo by Robert A  Heinlein proposed a primitive telepresence master slave manipulator system in 1942  In his pioneering paper  Minsky wrote   My first vision of a remote controlled economy came from Robert A  Heinlein s prophetic 1948 novel  Waldo   The year of the publication of Waldo in Minsky s comment in the paper was incorrect  The Brother Assassin  written by Fred Saberhagen in 1969  introduced the complete concept for a telepresence master slave humanoid system  In the novel  the concept is described as follows   And a moment later it seemed to all his senses that he had been transported from the master down into the body of the slave unit standing beneath it on the floor  As the control of its movements passed over to him  the slave started gradually to lean to one side  and he moved its foot to maintain balance as naturally as he moved his own  Tilting back his head  he could look up through the slave s eyes to see the master unit  with himself inside  maintaining the same attitude on its complex suspension   The first commercially successful telepresence company  Teleport  which was later renamed TeleSuite   was founded in 1993 by David Allen and Harold Williams  2  Before TeleSuite  they ran a resort business from which the original concept emerged  because they often found businesspeople would have to cut their stays short to participate in important meetings  Their idea was to develop a technology that would allow businesspeople to attend their meetings without leaving the resorts so that they could lengthen their hotel stays  Hilton Hotels had originally licensed to install them in their hotels throughout the United States and other countries  but use was low  The idea lost momentum  with Hilton eventually backing out  TeleSuite later began to focus less on the hospitality industry and more on business oriented telepresence systems  Shareholders eventually held enough stock to replace the company s original leadership  which ultimately led to its collapse  citation needed  David Allen purchased all of the assets of TeleSuite and appointed Scott Allen as president of the new company called Destiny Conferencing  Destiny Conferencing licensed its patent portfolio to HP which became the first large company to join the telepresence industry  soon followed by others such as Cisco and Polycom   3  After forming a distribution agreement with Pleasanton based Polycom  Destiny Conferencing sold on January 5  2007 to Polycom for  60 million  An important research project in telepresence began in 1990  Headquartered at the University of Toronto  the Ontario Telepresence Project  was a three year   4 8 million pre competitive research project whose mandate was to design and field trial advanced media space systems in a variety of workplaces in order to gain insights into key sociological and engineering issues  The OTP  which ended December  1994  was part of the International Telepresence Project which linked Ontario researchers to counterparts in four European nations  The Project s major sponsor was the Province of Ontario through two of its Centres of Excellence the Information Technology Research Centre  ITRC  and the Telecommunications Research Institute of Ontario  TRIO     quoting from the project s final report 4   The Project was an interdisciplinary effort involving social sciences and engineering   edit  Benefits A Teliris Unified VirtuaLive telepresence room in use  2007  An industry expert described some benefits of telepresence   There were four drivers for our decision to do more business over video and telepresence  We wanted to reduce our travel spend  reduce our carbon footprint and environmental impact  improve our employees  work life balance  and improve employee productivity    5  Rather than traveling great distances in order to have a face face meeting  it is now commonplace to instead use a telepresence system  which uses a multiple codec video system  which is what the word  telepresence  most currently represents   Each member party of the meeting uses a telepresence room to  dial in  and can see talk to every other member on a screen screens as if they were in the same room  This brings enormous time and cost benefits  It is also superior to phone conferencing  except in cost   as the visual aspect greatly enhances communications  allowing for perceptions of facial expressions and other body language  Mobile collaboration systems combine the use of video  audio and on screen drawing capabilities using newest generation hand held mobile devices to enable multi party conferencing in real time  independent of location  Benefits include cost efficiencies resulting from accelerated problem resolution  reductions in downtimes and travel  improvements in customer service and increased productivity  6   edit  Implementation Telepresence today  this particular room  a 210 Series owned by Pangeair  was built by Destiny Conferencing  later bought out by Polycom  Telepresence has been described as the human experience of being fully present at a live real world location remote from one s own physical location  Someone experiencing video telepresence would therefore be able to behave  and receive stimuli  as though part of a meeting at the remote site  The aforementioned would result in interactive participation of group activities that would bring benefits to a wide range of users  7   edit  Implementation of human sensory elements To provide a telepresence experience  technologies are required that implement the human sensory elements of vision  sound  and manipulation   edit  Vision A minimum system usually includes visual feedback  Ideally  the entire field of view of the user is filled with a view of the remote location  and the viewpoint corresponds to the movement and orientation of the user s head  In this way  it differs from television or cinema  where the viewpoint is out of the control of the viewer  In order to achieve this  the user may be provided with either a very large  or wraparound  screen  or small displays mounted directly in front of the eyes  The latter provides a particularly convincing 3D sensation  The movements of the user s head must be sensed  and the camera must mimic those movements accurately and in real time  This is important to prevent unintended motion sickness  Another source of future improvement to telepresence displays  compared by some to holograms  is a projected display technology featuring life sized imagery  8   edit  Sound Sound is generally the easiest sensation to implement with high fidelity  based on the foundational telephone technology dating back more than 130 years  Very high fidelity sound equipment has also been available for a considerable period of time  with stereophonic sound being more convincing than monaural sound   edit  Manipulation The ability to manipulate a remote object or environment is an important aspect for some telepresence users  and can be implemented in large number of ways depending on the needs of the user  Typically  the movements of the user s hands  position in space  and posture of the fingers  are sensed by wired gloves  inertial sensors  or absolute spatial position sensors  A robot in the remote location then copies those movements as closely as possible  This ability is also known as teleoperation  The more closely the robot re creates the form factor of the human hand  the greater the sense of telepresence  Complexity of robotic effectors varies greatly  from simple one axis grippers  to fully anthropomorphic robot hands  Haptic teleoperation refers to a system that provides some sort of tactile force feedback to the user  so the user feels some approximation of the weight  firmness  size  and or texture of the remote objects manipulated by the robot   edit  Degree of implementation  immersive vs  adaptive  or lite Telepresence s effectiveness varies by degree of fidelity  Research has noted that telepresence solutions differ in degree of implementation  from  immersive  through  adaptive  to  lite  solutions   9  At the top are immersive solutions where the environments at both ends are highly controlled  and often the same  with respect to lighting  acoustics  decor and furniture  thereby giving all the participants the impression they are together at the same table in the same room  thus engendering the  immersive  label  Adaptive telepresence solutions may use the same technology  but the environments at both ends are not highly controlled and hence often differ  Adaptive solutions differ from telepresence lite solutions not in terms of control of environments  but in terms of integration of technology  Adaptive solutions use a managed service  whereas telepresence lite solutions use components that someone must integrate   edit  Transparency of implementation A good telepresence strategy puts the human factors first  focusing on visual collaboration configurations that closely replicate the brain s innate preferences for interpersonal communications  separating from the unnatural  talking heads  experience of traditional videoconferencing  These cues include life size participants  fluid motion  accurate flesh tones and the appearance of true eye contact  10  This is already a well established technology  used by many businesses today  The chief executive officer of Cisco Systems  John Chambers in June 2006 at the Networkers Conference compared telepresence to teleporting from Star Trek  and said that he saw the technology as a potential billion dollar market for Cisco  11  Rarely will a telepresence system provide such a transparent implementation with such comprehensive and convincing stimuli that the user perceives no differences from actual presence  But the user may set aside such differences  depending on the application  The fairly simple telephone achieves a limited form of telepresence using just the human sensory element of hearing  in that users consider themselves to be talking to each other rather than talking to the telephone itself  Watching television  for example  although it stimulates our primary senses of vision and hearing  rarely gives the impression that the watcher is no longer at home  However  television sometimes engages the senses sufficiently to trigger emotional responses from viewers somewhat like those experienced by people who directly witness or experience events  Televised depictions of sports events  or disasters such as the September 11 terrorist attacks  can elicit strong emotions from viewers  As the screen size increases  so does the sense of immersion  as well as the range of subjective mental experiences available to viewers  Some viewers have reported a sensation of genuine vertigo or motion sickness while watching IMAX movies of flying or outdoor sequences  Because most currently feasible telepresence gear leaves something to be desired  the user must suspend disbelief to some degree  and choose to act in a natural way  appropriate to the remote location  perhaps using some skill to operate the equipment  In contrast  a telephone user does not see herself as  operating  the telephone  but merely talking to another person with it   edit  Related technologies  edit  Videocalls and videoconferencing Videophone calls  also  videocalls and video chat   12  differ from videoconferencing in that they expect to serve individuals  not groups  13  However that distinction has become increasingly blurred with technology improvements such as increased bandwidth and sophisticated software clients that can allow for multiple parties on a call  In general everyday usage the term videoconferencing is now frequently used instead of videocall for point to point calls between two units  Both videophone calls and videoconferencing are also now commonly referred to as a video link  Webcams are popular  relatively low cost devices which can provide live video and audio streams via personal computers  and can be used with many software clients for both video calls and videoconferencing  14  A videoconference system is generally higher cost than a videophone and deploys greater capabilities  A videoconference  also known as a videoteleconference  allows two or more locations to communicate via live  simultaneous two way video and audio transmissions  This is often accomplished by the use of a multipoint control unit  a centralized distribution and call management system  or by a similar non centralized multipoint capability embedded in each videoconferencing unit  Again  technology improvements have circumvented traditional definitions by allowing multiple party videoconferencing via web based applications  15  16  A separate webpage article is devoted to videoconferencing  A telepresence system is a high end videoconferencing system and service usually employed by enterprise level corporate offices  Telepresence conference rooms use state of the art room designs  video cameras  displays  sound systems and processors  coupled with high to very high capacity bandwidth transmissions  Typical uses of the various technologies described above include videocalling or videoconferencing on a one to one  one to many or many to many basis for personal  business  educational  deaf Video Relay Service and tele medical  diagnostic and rehabilitative use or services  New services utilizing videocalling and videoconferencing  such as teachers and psychologists conducting online sessions  17  personal videocalls to inmates incarcerated in penitentiaries  and videoconferencing to resolve airline engineering issues at maintenance facilities  are being created or evolving on an on going basis   edit  Virtual presence  virtual reality  Telepresence refers to a user interacting with another live  real place  and is distinct from virtual presence  where the user is given the impression of being in a simulated environment  Telepresence and virtual presence rely on similar user interface equipment  and they share the common feature that the relevant portions of the user s experience at some point in the process will be transmitted in an abstract  usually digital  representation  The main functional difference is the entity on the other end  a real environment in the case of telepresence  vs  a computer in the case of immersive virtual reality   edit  The cooperative web The Cooperative web or Co Web refers to a browser based platform that promises to replicate the power of face to face communications via web touch without sacrificing the quality of human interactions  using the human sensory elements of vision  sound and manipulation   edit  Applications Application examples could be cited within emergency management and security services  B amp I  and the entertainment and education industries  7   edit  Connecting communities Telepresence can be used to establish a sense of shared presence or shared space among geographically separated members of a group  citation needed   edit  Hazardous environments Many other applications in situations where humans are exposed to hazardous situations are readily recognised as suitable candidates for telepresence  Mining  bomb disposal  military operations  rescue of victims from fire  toxic atmospheres  deep sea exploration  or even hostage situations  are some examples  Telepresence also plays a critical role in the exploration of other worlds  such as with the Mars Exploration Rovers  which are teleoperated from Earth   edit  Pipeline inspection Small diameter pipes otherwise inaccessible for examination can now be viewed using pipeline video inspection   edit  Remote surgery The possibility of being able to project the knowledge and the physical skill of a surgeon over long distances has many attractions  Thus  again there is considerable research underway in the subject   Locally controlled robots are currently being used for joint replacement surgery as they are more precise in milling bone to receive the joints   The armed forces have an obvious interest since the combination of telepresence  teleoperation  and telerobotics can potentially save the lives of battle casualties by allowing them prompt attention in mobile operating theatres by remote surgeons  Recently  teleconferencing has been used in medicine  telemedicine or telematics   mainly employing audio visual exchange  for the performance of real time remote surgical operations   as demonstrated in Regensburg  Germany in 2002  18  In addition to audio visual data  the transfer of haptic  tactile  information has also been demonstrated in telemedicine  19   edit  Sign language communications via videotelephony Video Interpreter sign used at VRS VRI service locations Main articles  Video Relay Service  a telecommunication service for deaf  hard of hearing and speech impaired  mute  individuals communicating with hearing persons  and also Video Remote Interpreting  used when both parties are at the same location  One of the first demonstrations of the ability for telecommunications to help sign language users communicate with each other occurred when AT amp T s videophone  trademarked as the  Picturephone   was introduced to the public at the 1964 New York World s Fair  two deaf users were able to communicate freely with each other between the fair and another city  20  Various other organizations  including British Telecom s Martlesham facility and several universities have also conducted extensive research on signing via videotelephony  21  The use of sign language via videotelephony was hampered for many years due to the difficulty of its use over slow analogue copper phone lines coupled with the high cost of better quality ISDN  data  phone lines  21  Those factors largely disappeared with the introduction of more efficient video codecs and the advent of lower cost high speed ISDN data and IP  Internet  services in the 1990s   edit  21st century improvements Significant improvements in video call quality of service for the deaf occurred in the United States in 2003 when Sorenson Media Inc   formerly Sorenson Vision Inc    a video compression software coding company  developed its VP 100 model stand alone videophone specifically for the deaf community  It was designed to output its video to the user s television in order to lower the cost of acquisition  and to offer remote control and a powerful video compression codec for unequaled video quality and ease of use with video relay services  Favourable reviews quickly led to its popular usage at educational facilities for the deaf  and from there to the greater deaf community  22  Coupled with similar high quality videophones introduced by other electronics manufacturers  the availability of high speed Internet  and sponsored video relay services authorized by the U S  Federal Communications Commission in 2002  VRS services for the deaf underwent rapid growth in that country  22  A deaf or hard of hearing person at his workplace using a VRS to communicate with a hearing person in London   Courtesy  SignVideo   edit  Present day usage Using such video equipment in the present day  the deaf  hard of hearing and speech impaired can communicate between themselves and with hearing individuals using sign language  The United States and several other countries compensate companies to provide  Video Relay Services   VRS   Telecommunication equipment can be used to talk to others via a sign language interpreter  who uses a conventional telephone at the same time to communicate with the deaf person s party  Video equipment is also used to do on site sign language translation via Video Remote Interpreting  VRI   The relative low cost and widespread availability of 3G mobile phone technology with video calling capabilities have given deaf and speech impaired users a greater ability to communicate with the same ease as others  Some wireless operators have even started free sign language gateways  Sign language interpretation services via VRS or by VRI are useful in the present day where one of the parties is deaf  hard of hearing or speech impaired  mute   In such cases the interpretation flow is normally within the same principal language  such as French Sign Language  LSF  to spoken French  Spanish Sign Language  LSE  to spoken Spanish  British Sign Language  BSL  to spoken English  and American Sign Language  ASL  also to spoken English  since BSL and ASL are completely distinct to each other   and so on  A Video Interpreter  V I   assisting an on screen client   Courtesy  SignVideo  Multilingual sign language interpreters  who can also translate as well across principal languages  such as to and from SSL  to and from spoken English   are also available  albeit less frequently  Such activities involve considerable effort on the part of the translator  since sign languages are distinct natural languages with their own construction  semantics and syntax  different from the aural version of the same principal language  With video interpreting  sign language interpreters work remotely with live video and audio feeds  so that the interpreter can see the deaf or mute party  and converse with the hearing party  and vice versa  Much like telephone interpreting  video interpreting can be used for situations in which no on site interpreters are available  However  video interpreting cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone  VRS and VRI interpretation requires all parties to have the necessary equipment  Some advanced equipment enables interpreters to control the video camera remotely  in order to zoom in and out or to point the camera toward the party that is signing  Further information  Language interpretation  Sign language  edit  Education A professional development expert in Denver uses telepresence to coach a teacher in Utah during the initial research of Project ThereNow  by Shawn Edmondson  Ph D  Research has been conducted on the use of telepresence to provide professional development to teachers  Research has shown that one of the most effective forms of teacher professional development is coaching  or cognitive apprenticeship  The application of telepresence shows promise for making this approach to teacher professional development practical  23  The benefits of enabling schoolchildren to take an active part in exploration have also been shown by the JASON and the NASA Ames Research Center programs  The ability of a pupil  student  or researcher to explore an otherwise inaccessible location is a very attractive proposition  For example  locations where the passage of too many people is harming the immediate environment or the artifacts themselves  e g  undersea exploration of coral reefs  ancient Egyptian tombs  and more recent works of art   edit  Telepresence art A soap opera for iMacs True telepresence is a multidisciplinary art and science that foundationally integrates engineering  psychology  and the art of television broadcast  In 1998  Diller and Scofidio created the  Refresh   an Internet based art installation that juxtaposed a live web camera with recorded videos staged by professional actors  Each image was accompanied with a fictional narrative which made it difficult to distinguish which was the live web camera  In 1993  Eduardo Kac and Ed Bennett created a telepresence installation  Ornitorrinco on the Moon   for the international telecommunication arts festival  Blurred Boundaries   Entgrenzte Grenzen II   It was coordinated by Kulturdata  in Graz  Austria  and was connected around the world  From 1997 to the present Ghislaine Boddington of shinkansen and body gt data gt space has explored  in a multi group process called The Weave 24  using performing arts techniques  the extended us of telepresence into festivals  arts centres and clubs and has directed numerous workshops leading to exploration of telepresence by many artists worldwide  This work has been most recently applied to extending skills in tele intuition for young people in preparation for the future world of work through the body gt data gt space   NESTA project  Robots and Avatars  an innovative project explores how young people will work and play with new representational forms of themselves and others in virtual and physical life in the next
