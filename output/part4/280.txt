credits sequence  General Thaddeus  Thunderbolt  Ross  William Hurt  meets with Dr  Bruce Banner  Edward Norton   the colleague and lover of his daughter Betty  Liv Tyler   regarding an experiment  Ross says  to make humans immune to gamma radiation  The experiment  which in truth is part of an operation Ross hopes will create a  super soldier   fails  transforming Banner into the Hulk  voiced by Lou Ferrigno  whenever Banner becomes angry  As the Hulk  he destroys the lab and injures Betty  Afterwards  he flees  becoming a fugitive from the United States Army  Five years later  Banner works at a bottling factory in Rocinha  Rio de Janeiro  while searching for a cure for his condition  On the Internet  he collaborates with a colleague he knows only as  Mr  Blue   and to whom he is  Mr  Green   He is also learning meditative breathing techniques from a martial arts expert  Rickson Gracie  to help keep control  and has not transformed in 158 days  After Banner cuts his finger  a drop of his blood falls into a bottle  and is eventually ingested by a consumer  Stan Lee  in Milwaukee  Wisconsin  creating medical complications  Using the bottle to trace Banner s location  Ross sends a team  led by British Royal Marine Emil Blonsky  Tim Roth  to capture him  Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky s team  After Ross explains how Banner became the Hulk  Blonsky agrees to be injected with a small amount of a serum developed as part of the same operation  which gives him enhanced physical attributes and the side effect of making him arrogant and overconfident  Banner returns to Culver University in Virginia  where he first became the Hulk  and reunites with Betty  who is dating psychiatrist Leonard Samson  Ty Burrell   Banner is attacked by Ross and Blonsky s forces  tipped off by the suspicious Samson  The Hulk dispatches Ross and Blonsky s team and flees with Betty  After the Hulk reverts to Banner  he and Betty go on the run  Banner makes contact with Mr  Blue  who urges them to meet him in New York City  He turns out to be cellular biologist Dr  Samuel Sterns  Tim Blake Nelson   who tells Banner he has developed a possible antidote to Banner s condition  After a successful test  though he warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse each individual transformation  Sterns reveals he has synthesized Banner s blood samples  which Banner sent from Brazil  into a large supply  with the intention of using it to bring humans to the next evolutionary level  Appalled by what Sterns has done  and fearful of the Hulk s power falling into the wrong hands  Banner attempts to convince Sterns to destroy the blood supply  Ross  forces attack and take Banner into custody with Betty  Blonsky forces Sterns to inject him with Banner s blood  as he covets the Hulk s power  Sterns warns that the combination of the super soldier formula and Banner s blood may turn him into an  abomination   Unconcerned  Blonsky forces Sterns to administer the blood and a gamma charge  The experiment goes wrong and Blonsky mutates into a creature with strength surpassing that of the Hulk  but cannot change back  Blonsky then attacks Sterns and gets some of the blood on his forehead causing it to bulge and mutate him  which  in the comics  leads to his becoming The Leader   Blonsky rampages through Harlem to draw the Hulk out  Realizing that the Hulk is the only one who can stop Blonsky  Banner convinces Ross to release him  He jumps from Ross  helicopter as it hovers over the city  the adrenaline surge of the act transforming him into the Hulk  After a long and brutal battle through Harlem  the Hulk defeats Blonsky by choking him with a huge chain  relenting only after Betty s plea  After having a small  peaceful moment with Betty  the Hulk flees  Thirty one days later  Banner is in Bella Coola  British Columbia  Instead of trying to suppress his transformation  he is attempting to transform in a controlled manner  As his eyes turn green  a grin appears on his face  In a short scene before the credits  while General Ross is drinking in a bar he is approached by industrialist Tony Stark  Robert Downey  Jr    who reveals that a  team  is being formed   edit  Cast Edward Norton as Dr  Bruce Banner   Hulk  A genius scientist who  because of exposure to gamma radiation  transforms into the Hulk when stressed  enraged  or excited  David Duchovny was a front runner for the film before Norton s casting  7 Gale Anne Hurd recalled Norton s portrayals of duality in Primal Fear and Fight Club  8  while Norton reminded Kevin Feige of Bill Bixby  who played Banner in the TV series  9  Lou Ferrigno  who played the Hulk with Bixby  remarked Norton  has a similar physique  and a  similar personality   10  Norton was a Hulk fan  citing the first comic appearances  the Bixby TV show  and Bruce Jones  run on the comic  as his favorite depictions of the character  11  He had expressed interest in the role for the first film  12  He initially turned down the part for this film  recalling  there  was  the wince factor or the defensive part of you that recoils at what the bad version of what that would be   as he felt the previous film  strayed far afield from a story that was familiar to people        which is a fugitive story   When he met Leterrier and Marvel  however  he liked their vision  and believed they were looking to him to guide the project  Thus  Norton rewrote the script  13   Edward s script has given Bruce s story real gravitas   Leterrier said   Admittedly I m not the most adult director  but just because we re making a superhero movie it doesn t have to just appeal to 13 year old boys  Ed and I both see superheroes as the new Greek gods   14  Lou Ferrigno voices The Hulk  During the 2008 New York Comic Con Leterrier publicly offered Ferrigno the chance to voice the Hulk for the film  15  This marks the third time Ferrigno portrayed the Hulk  having also voiced the character in the 1996 animated series  Originally  the Hulk s only line was  Betty  at the film s ending  which would have been his first word  Leterrier was aware that fans wanted him to speak normally  and added  leave me alone  and  Hulk smash   The latter line received cheers during a screening he attended  16  Ferrigno also has a cameo in the film as a security guard who is bribed by Banner with a pizza  17  Liv Tyler as Dr  Elizabeth  Betty  Ross  Bruce s girlfriend  whom he is separated from due to his condition  and a cellular biologist  Tyler replaced actress Jennifer Connelly  who portrayed Betty Ross in the 2003 film Hulk  Tyler and Connelly had previously played sisters in the 1997 film Inventing the Abbotts  Tyler was attracted to the love story in the script  and was a fan of the TV show  because of the  humanity and what  Banner  is going through   11  She was called about the role while driving to her home  and she accepted the part after a day without reading the script  18  Tyler and Norton spent hours discussing Bruce and Betty s life before he became the Hulk  19  She said filming the part  was very physical  which was fun   20  and compared her performance to  a deer caught in the headlights   because of Betty s shock at Bruce s unexpected return into her life  19  Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky  A Russian born officer from the United Kingdom s Royal Marines Commandos loaned to General Ross  Recognizing he is past his prime  he lusts after the Hulk s power  Roth said he took the part to please his sons  who are comic book superhero fans  As a teenager  Roth was a fan of the 1970s TV series  and he also found Leterrier s ideas  very dark and very interesting   Roth started watching the 2003 film to prepare for the part  but stopped as he did not want to be caught up in the controversy over its quality  and to compare himself to it  21  It was Roth who suggested Blonsky be a soldier  whereas in the comics he was a KGB agent  22  Leterrier is a fan of Roth s work  and felt  it s great watching a normal Cockney boy become a superhero    14  but Marvel and Norton were initially reluctant to cast him  23  Before he was cast in Punisher  War Zone  Ray Stevenson was in discussions for the role  24  Roth prepared for the part by learning to fire guns and break into rooms with two experts  22  Roth found it tough shooting the chases  because he could not work out to show Blonsky s aging  19  He especially found it difficult to run while pulled with a harness  which was used to show the injected Blonsky s 30 40 mile per hour running abilities  25 Cyril Raffaelli performed some of Roth s stunts  8  Roth enjoyed the motion capture  which reminded him of fringe theatre  and he hired his trainer from Planet of the Apes to aid him in portraying the monster s movement  19  William Hurt as General Thaddeus  Thunderbolt  Ross  Betty s father  who has dedicated himself to capturing the Hulk  Leterrier cast Hurt because  Ross is more physical  more explosive in this movie  and no actor goes from zero to 100 as well as William   14  He compared Ross to Captain Ahab  23  The Hulk is Hurt s favorite superhero  and his son is also a big fan of the character  Hurt found production very different from the typical  pure anxiety  of a studio movie  finding it more akin to an independent movie  26  He described Ross as  humiliated by Hulk s conscience  he actually sees and recognizes that it s more developed than his own  even though he s a patriot and a warrior for his country  He s sacrificed  much  for that purpose  but at the expense at times of his humanity   which he occasionally recovers   27 Sam Elliott  who played Ross in the first film  would have liked to reprise the role  noting it was odd seeing someone take his part   but I ll be looking forward to seeing this one   28  Ty Burrell as Dr  Leonard Samson  The psychiatrist in a relationship with Betty during Bruce s absence  Burrell had performed with Norton in the off Broadway play Burn This in 2003  and when Leterrier met him  he recognized Burrell as the  jerk  from the 2004 Dawn of the Dead remake  29  which was how Samson was characterized in the script before Norton rewrote it  30  He is presented as a mostly sympathetic character  Additional cast members include Tim Blake Nelson as the scientist Samuel Sterns  and Robert Downey  Jr  cameos as Tony Stark at the end of the film  As The Incredible Hulk takes place during and after both Iron Man films  Stark has therefore already announced that he is Iron Man  He did it as a favor to Marvel Studios  which he acknowledged as a smart move on Marvel s part  because when he was promoting his film he would also have to mention their other production  31  Hulk co creator Stan Lee cameos as a man who becomes ill when drinking the soda poisoned by Banner s blood  Michael K  Williams appears in the film  in a role that was written for him by Norton  who is a fan of The Wire  32 Paul Soles  who voiced Banner in the 1966 The Marvel Superheroes cartoon  cameos as Stanley  a kindly pizza restaurant owner who helps Banner  Additionally  the late Bill Bixby appears  when a scene featuring Bixby on his TV comedy drama The Courtship of Eddie s Father plays on a television Banner is watching at the beginning of the film  Rickson Gracie has a small role as Bruce Banner s martial arts instructor  despite his Brazilian Jiu Jitsu background  he is credited as an Aikido instructor  Martin Starr cameos as a computer nerd college lab student  The novelization changes his role to Amadeus Cho  Captain America appears in a deleted scene frozen in ice  but is so far in the background that the actor cannot be identified  This scene was also drawn and included in the 2010 animated series  The Avengers  Earth s Mightiest Heroes in the episode  Assembly Required    edit  Production  edit  Development The Incredible Hulk is influenced by the TV series of the same name  Above is Edward Norton  and below is Bill Bixby  both sitting in a similar machine  At the time of the release of Ang Lee s Hulk  screenwriter James Schamus was planning a sequel  featuring the Gray Hulk  He was also considering the Leader and the Abomination as villains  33  Marvel wanted the Abomination because he was the most famous enemy  and because he would be an actual threat to the Hulk  unlike General Ross  34  During the filming of Hulk  producer Avi Arad had a target May 2005 theatrical release date  35  On January 18  2006 Arad confirmed Marvel Studios would be providing the money for The Incredible Hulk s production budget  with Universal distributing  36  because Universal did not meet the deadline for filming a sequel  7  Marvel felt it would be better to deviate from Ang Lee s style to continue the franchise  arguing his film was like a parallel universe one shot comic book  and their next film needed to be  in Kevin Feige s words   really starting the Marvel Hulk franchise   Producer Gale Anne Hurd also felt the film had to meet what  everyone expects to see from having read the comics and seen the TV series   19  Louis Leterrier  who enjoyed the TV series as a child and liked the first film  8  19  had expressed interest in directing the Iron Man film adaptation  Jon Favreau had taken that project  so Marvel offered him the Hulk  Leterrier was reluctant as he was unsure if he could replicate Lee s style  but Marvel explained that was not their intent  37  Leterrier s primary inspiration was Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale s Hulk  Gray  a retelling of his first appearance   He replicated every comic book panel that he pinned up during pre production  from the many comics he browsed  in the final film  8  Leterrier said that he planned to show Bruce Banner s struggle with the monster within him  38  while Feige added the film would explore  that element of wish fulfillment  of overcoming an injustice or a bully and tapping into a strength that you didn t quite realize you had in yourself   39  Arad also said the film would be  a lot more of a love story between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross   40  Zak Penn  who wrote a draft of the first film in 1996  said the film would follow up Hulk  but stressed it would be more tonally similar to the TV show and Bruce Jones  run on the comic  He compared his script to Aliens  which was a very different film to Alien  but still in the same continuity  41  He included two scenes from his 1996 script  Banner jumping from a helicopter to trigger a transformation  and realizing he is unable to have sex with Betty  42  Penn wrote three drafts  before departing in early 2007 to direct The Grand  Norton  who had rewritten previous films he starred in  wrote a new draft  which pleased the director and the studio in establishing the film as a reboot  43  Leterrier acknowledged the only remaining similarity between the two films was Bruce hiding in South America  8  and that the film was a unique reboot  as generally audiences would have expected another forty minute origin story  44  There were previous discussions to set the first act in Thailand  45  Leterrier felt audiences were left restless waiting for the character to arrive in Ang Lee s film  44  Gale Anne Hurd noted fans dubbed the film a  requel   a portmanteau of reboot and sequel  46  Norton explained of his decision to ignore Lee s origin story   I don t even like the phrase origin story  and I don t think in great literature and great films that explaining the roots of the story doesn t mean it comes in the beginning   11   Audiences know this story   he added    so  deal with it artfully   He wanted to  have revelations even in the third act about what set this whole thing in motion   13  The new origin story references Ultimate Marvel s take on the Hulk  which also had him created in an attempt to create super soldiers  47  Norton deleted Rick Jones and toned down S H I E L D  s presence  19  He also added the scene where Banner attempts to extract a cure from a flower and his e mailing with Samuel Sterns  42  which references Bruce Jones  story  48  Norton rewrote scenes every day  21  Ultimately  the Writers Guild of America decided to credit the script solely to Penn  49  who argued Norton had not dramatically changed his script  Journalist Anne Thompson explained  The Guild tends to favor plot  structure and pre existing characters over dialogue   Before either Penn and Norton joined the project  an anonymous screenwriter wrote a draft and lobbied for credit  42   edit  Filming Leterrier had to direct four units with a broken foot  14  Filming began on July 9  2007  Shooting primarily took place in Toronto  because mayor David Miller is a Hulk fan and promised to be very helpful to the crew when closing Yonge Street for four nights in September to shoot the Hulk and Blonsky s clash at 125th Street  Despite messing the street with explosives and overturned burning vehicles  the crew would clean up within twenty minutes so business could continue as normal each day  50  The first action sequence shot was the Culver University battle  which was filmed at the University of Toronto and Morningside Park  The filmmakers built a glass wall over a walkway at the University for when the soldiers trap him inside to smoke out the Hulk  25  There was also shooting in the Financial District  29  A factory in Hamilton  Ontario  which was due for demolition  was the interior of the Brazilian factory  The site s underground floors were used for Ross  military command center  50  The crew also shot part of the Hulk and Blonsky s fight on a backlot in Hamilton  51  Other Canadian locations included CFB Trenton and a glacier in Bella Coola  British Columbia  29  Afterwards  there was a week long shoot in New York City and two weeks in Rio de Janeiro  52  While there  the crew shot at Rocinha  Lapa  Tijuca Forest and Santa Teresa  Filming concluded in November after eighty eight days of filming  29  The Incredible Hulk joined Toronto s Green Screen initiative  to help cut carbon emissions and waste created during filming  53  Producer Gale Anne Hurd acknowledged the Hulk  being green  was a popular environmental analogy  and Norton himself was an environmentalist  Hybrid and fuel efficient vehicles were used  with low sulfur diesel as their energy source  The construction department used a sustainably harvested  locally sourced yellow pine instead of lauan for the sets  and also used zero or low VOC paint  The wood was generally recycled or given to environmental organizations  and paint cans were handed to waste management  In addition  they used  cloth bags  biodegradable food containers  china and silverware food utensils  a stainless steel mug for each production crew member  a contractor who removed bins  recycled paper  biodegradable soap and cleaners in the trailers and production offices  and the sound department used rechargeable batteries  29 The Incredible Hulk became the first blockbuster film to receive the Environmental Media Association s Green Seal  which is displayed during the end credits  54   edit  Effects The Hulk faces down Emil Blonsky  Tim Roth   Leterrier cited the motion capture portrayals of Gollum and King Kong by Andy Serkis  from The Lord of the Rings and King Kong  as the standard he was aiming for  37  Norton and Roth filmed 2500 takes of different movements the monsters would make  such as the Hulk s  thunder claps    29 Phosphorescent face paint applied to the actors  faces and strobe lighting would help record the most subtle mannerisms into the computer  55  Others including Cyril Raffaelli provided motion capture for stunts and fights  22  after the main actors had done video referencing  56  Leterrier hired Rhythm and Hues to provide the CGI  rather than Industrial Light  amp  Magic who created the visual effects for Ang Lee s Hulk  Visual effect company  Image Engine  spent over a year working on a shot where Banner s gamma irradiated blood falls through three factory floors into a bottle  57  Overall 700 effects shots were created  Motion capture aided in placing and timing of movements  but overall key frame animation by Rhythm and Hues provided the necessary  finesse  and  superhero quality   58  Many of the animators and Leterrier himself provided video reference for the climactic fight  25  Dale Keown s comic book artwork of the Hulk was an inspiration for his design  37  Leterrier felt the first Hulk had  too much fat  and  the proportions were a little off   He explained   The Hulk is beyond perfect so there is zero grams of fat  all chiseled  and his muscle and strength defines this creature so he s like a tank   37 Visual effects supervisor Kurt Williams envisioned the Hulk s physique as a linebacker rather than a bodybuilder  A height of nine feet was chosen for the character as they did not want him to be too inhuman  To make him more expressive  computer programs controlling the inflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created  Williams cited flushing as an example of humans  skin color being influenced by their emotions  29  The animators felt green blood would make his skin become darker rather than lighter  and his skin tones  depending on lighting  either resemble an olive or even gray slate  55  His animation model was completed without the effects company s full knowledge of what he would be required to do  he was rigged to do whatever they imagined  in case the model was to be used for The Avengers film  58  The Hulk s medium length hair was modeled on Mike Deodato s art  58  He originally had a crew cut  but Leterrier decided flopping hair imbued him with more character  56  Leterrier cited An American Werewolf in London as the inspiration for Banner s transformation  wanting to show how painful it was for him to change  59  As a nod to the live action TV series  Banner s eyes change color first when he transforms  60  Bruce Banner s eyes turn green as he transforms into the Hulk  Leterrier changed the Abomination s design from the comics because he felt the audience would question why he resembled a fish or a reptile  instead of  an  ber human  like the Hulk  Rather  his hideousness is derived from being injected multiple times into his skin  muscles and bones  creating a creature with a protruding spine and sharp bones that he can use to stab  His green skin is pale  and reflects light  so it appears orange because of surrounding fire during the climactic battle  23  The motion capture performers  including Roth  tried to make the character behave less gracefully than the Hulk  They modeled his posture and the way he turns his head on a shark  34  The character also shares Roth s tattoos  61  A height of eleven feet was chosen for the character  29  Leterrier tried to work in the character s pointed ears  but realized the Hulk would bite them off  using the example of Mike Tyson when he fought Evander Holyfield   and felt ignoring that would make the Hulk come across as stupid  62  Leterrier had planned to use prosthetic makeup and animatronics to complement the computer generated imagery that was solely used in the previous film  63  The make up artists who worked on X Men  The Last Stand were set to portray Blonsky s gradual transformation  21  which Zak Penn said would portray Blonsky  not  being  used to having these properties  Like he s much heavier  and we talked about how when he walks down the sidewalk  his weight destroys the sidewalk and he s tripping   It s all about  the humanization of these kinds of superhero characters  showing the effects physics may actually have on  them    64  Tom Woodruff  Jr  of Amalgamated Dynamics  who created all the costumes for the Alien films since Alien 3  was in negotiations  and created two busts of the Hulk and prosthetic hands to act as stand ins for the character  However  a full animatronic was never created as it was decided it would complicate production to set up shots for a puppet and then a computer graphic  65  An animatronic was used for Sterns  mutating head though  51  Destruction was mostly done practically  A model of a bottling machine was smashed through a wall for when the Hulk escapes with the factory  The filmmakers used steam and dry ice for the gas used to smoke out the Hulk  and they destroyed a real Humvee by dropping a weight on it when shooting the Culver University battle  Pipes blew fire for when the Hulk strikes down the computer generated helicopter  When Banner falls from the helicopter to trigger the Hulk into fighting the Abomination  Norton was attached to a surface held by a bar which turned 90 degrees while the camera was pulled to the ceiling to simulate falling  Leterrier felt making Norton fall that distance would obviously render him unable to act  25   edit  Music See also  The Incredible Hulk  Original Motion Picture Score Craig Armstrong was the arranger for Massive Attack  a band Leterrier was fond of and had collaborated with on Unleashed  2005   Armstrong was his first choice  which surprised Marvel  not knowing if he had scored an action film  he did compose 2001 s Kiss of the Dragon   66  Even the temp track consisted of Armstrong s work and similar music by others  The Hulk  alongside the Green Lantern  was one of Armstrong s favorite comics as a child  although he did not see Ang Lee s Hulk  67  Armstrong began composing in his home in Glasgow  Scotland with three sequences  the Hulk and Betty in the cave  the Abomination and the Hulk s alley fight  and Bruce and Betty s reunion  The majority was composed in a few weeks in Los Angeles  California  which was very intense for the director and composer  The score was recorded over four days during late April 2008 in a chapel in Bastyr University  located in Kenmore  Washington  Pete Lockett played ethnic instruments in the score  which were recorded in London and mixed together with the orchestra and electronics  67  The score was orchestrated by Matt Dunkley and Tony Blondal The Hulk and the Abomination both have two themes  representing their human and monstrous forms  The Hulk s theme was meant to be iconic and simple  like Jaws  1975   with string glissandos on a base C note  Banner s theme is tragic and includes parts of Joe Harnell s  The Lonely Man  theme from the television series  Armstrong played the piano for one scene featuring that piece  Blonsky has a dark theme  which becomes aggressive when he transforms  Armstrong inter played the Hulk and the Abomination s themes during their battle  and found scoring the action sequences similar to a dance  There is also a suspenseful theme  and a love theme  67  Leterrier suggested the score be released on two discs  which Armstrong believed to be a joke  Only when he compiled the album   and Marvel asked why they were only given one disc   did he realize they were serious  67   edit  Release  edit  Editing Seventy minutes of footage  mostly dealing with the origin  were not included in the final cut  30  Much of this back story was unscripted and the filmmakers were never sure of including it into the final cut  and had considered releasing some of these clips on the internet  17  Editor Kyle Cooper  creator of the Marvel logo  with the flipping pages  and the montage detailing Iron Man s biography in that film  edited together much of this footage into the opening credits  17  Leterrier explained a negative test screening  where flashbacks were placed across the film that the audience found too similar to Hulk  had resulted in compressing these to the film s start  30  This replaced the original opening  where Banner comes to the Arctic to commit suicide  When the scene ends  in an instant the frozen body of Captain America is partially seen in the ice  Leterrier said he did not want this scene to be lost amid the opening montage  30  Norton and Leterrier disputed with the producers over the final running time  they wanted it to be near 135 minutes  while the producers wanted the film to be under two hours  This was made public  and rumors spread that Norton  made it clear he won t cooperate with publicity plans if he s not happy with the final product   68  Norton dismissed this   Our healthy process  of collaboration   which is and should be a private matter  was misrepresented publicly as a  dispute   seized on by people looking for a good story  and has been distorted to such a degree that it risks distracting from the film itself  which Marvel  Universal and I refuse to let happen  It has always been my firm conviction that films should speak for themselves and that knowing too much about how they are made diminishes the magic of watching them   69   edit  Marketing  We know the Hulk from 2003 didn t satisfy the fans  and we had to acknowledge that  We emphasized the passion that fans still have for this character and that this is the movie people have always wanted    Stephanie Sperber  executive vice president of Universal Studios Partnerships 70  Universal and its promotional partners have tried to position The Incredible Hulk as a franchise reboot similar to Batman Begins  Effort was made to promote the story as having a romance and a physical antagonist  and the title was used for promotional puns  such as 7 Eleven s  Incredible Gulp  slurpees  and  Incredible Dad  themed Father s Day gifts at Kmart   Burger King also promoted the film  and General Nutrition Centers used the title character as a role model for strength training  70 Hasbro created the toy line  which they released on May 3  2008  71  while Sega released a video game on June 5  2008  72  The film was promoted in an episode of American Gladiators on June 9  2008  which was hosted by Hulk Hogan and featured Lou Ferrigno  73  Following the edit dispute  Universal s Adam Fogleson and Norton planned a promotional tour which would avoid constant media interviews and therefore uncomfortable questions  He attended the premiere  took part in a Jimmy Kimmel Live  sketch and would also promote the film in Japan  42  However  during the film s release he chose to do charity work in Africa  74   edit  Box office Louis Leterrier promoting the film in Paris in July 2008  The film was released on June 13  2008  and in its opening weekend  grossed  55 4 million in 3 505 theaters in the United States and Canada  ranking  1 at the box office  75  The previous film earned  62 1 million in its opening weekend  but dropped 70  in its second weekend  The second film by comparison  dropped 60  in its second weekend  76  Behind Fantastic Four  Rise of the Silver Surfer  it was the second highest gross for a film released over a Father s Day weekend  77  This surpassed the Los Angeles Times s report of expectations of a  45 million opening  following the disappointing response to the 2003 film  Universal believed word of mouth will contribute to the film eventually breaking even  2  A CinemaScore poll indicated the majority of viewers were male and graded the film an A   and 82  of them had seen the 2003 film  78  It also opened in thirty eight other countries  which added  31 million to the total opening  The film outgrossed the 2003 film in South Korea  while its openings in Mexico and Russia created records for Universal  79  The film grossed 24 million yuan  roughly  3 4 million  in its Chinese opening on August 26  outgrossing the previous film s overall gross of ten million yuan  80  As of March 11  2009  the film grossed  134 806 913 in the United States  as well as  128 620 638 internationally  bringing its worldwide gross to  263 427 551  3  The film  even though it barely passed its predecessor  and equalled if the smaller budget of the first film is taken in to account  is still considered successful  Entertainment analyst David Davis told The Hollywood Reporter   The first Hulk had such high expectations after the NBC Universal merger and was supposed to be critical favorite Ang Lee s breakout commercial blockbuster  Then with the new Hulk film  Marvel was able to underplay the importance of the success after the great success of Iron Man this summer  So the new one overdelivered  relative to its underpromise   81   edit  Reception The Incredible Hulk received generally positive reviews from film critics  Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 66  of 214 critics gave the film positive reviews  82 Metacritic reported the film received an average score of 61 out of 100  based on 38 reviews  The site characterized reviews as  generally favorable   83  Todd McCarthy of Variety said   what seemed  in theory  the least necessary revival of a big screen superhero emerges as perfectly solid summer action fare in The Incredible Hulk   He emphasized  it s all par for the course cinematic demolition and destruction  staged efficiently and with a hint of enthusiasm   and  penned with sporadic wit       Visuals lean toward the dark and murky  but editing by three actually six hands is fleet  and Craig Armstrong s ever present score is simultaneously bombastic and helpfully supportive of the action  Effects are in line with pic s generally pro but not inspired achievements   84  Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald applauded that the film  does a lot of things  Ang  Lee s Hulk didn t  It s lighter and faster paced  it s funnier and it embraces  instead of ignoring  the 1970s TV series that furthered the character s popularity   85  Mark Rahner of The Seattle Times wrote that   The relaunch of Marvel s green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee s ponderous 2003 Hulk in nearly every way   except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game  and he still barely talks   86 Lou Lumenick of The New York Post said   What lingers in my memory     is the lengthy  essentially animated climactic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination on the streets and rooftops of Harlem  and an earlier showdown between the title creature and the U S  Army  which is deploying high tech weapons including sound wave cannons  These are expertly staged by director Louis Leterrier  who disposes of the backstory under the opening credits and wraps up the whole thing in twenty four minutes less than  Ang  Lee took   87 Roger Ebert was not a fan of the film stating    The Incredible Hulk  is no doubt an ideal version of the Hulk saga for those who found Ang Lee s  Hulk   2003  too talky  or dare I say  too thoughtful  But not for me  It sidesteps the intriguing aspects of Hulkdom and spends way too much time in  dare I say  noisy and mindless action sequences   88  Conversely  Christy Lemire of the Associated Press found that  the inevitable comparisons to Iron Man  Marvel Studios  first blockbuster this summer  serve as a glaring reminder of what this Hulk lacks  wit and heart  Despite the presence of Edward Norton  an actor capable of going just as deep as Robert Downey Jr   we don t feel a strong sense of Bruce Banner s inner conflict   89 A O  Scott of The New York Times opined    The Adequate Hulk  would have been a more suitable title  There are some big  thumping fights and a few bright shards of pop cultural wit  but for the most part this movie seems content to aim for the generic mean   90 David Ansen of Newsweek wrote   Leterrier has style  he s good with action and he s eager to give the audience its money s worth of bone crunching battles  Still  once the movie leaves the atmospheric Brazilian settings  nothing in this  Hulk  sinks in deeply  its familiar genre pleasures are all on the surface      The movie s scene stealer is Tim Blake Nelson  making a comically welcome third act appearance as the unethical but madly enthusiastic scientist Samuel Sterns   91  The film was nominated for best superhero film at the 2008 National Movie Awards and for Best Science Fiction Film at the Saturn Awards  92  93   edit  Home media The film was number one in sales when released on DVD and Blu ray on October 21  2008  in the United States  having been available in the United Kingdom since October 13   There are widescreen and fullscreen single disc editions  a three disc special edition  and a two disc Blu ray package  The first disc contains an audio commentary by Leterrier and Roth  while the second comes with special features and deleted scenes  and the third with a digital copy of the film  94  The Blu ray edition compresses the content of the first two DVDs onto one  while the second disc contains the digital copy  95  The package features a green border  marking the first time the Blu ray case for a film is not blue  96  So far  it made  58 448 280 in home video sales  bringing its total film gross to  321 875 831  6   edit  Sequel Samuel Sterns  played by Tim Blake Nelson  was introduced to set him up as a villain in a future film  where he would become the Leader  19  97  Aaron Sims  the lead designer on The Incredible Hulk  also took time to work on concepts for the Leader  98  Nelson is signed on to reprise the role  99 Gale Anne Hurd noted because the Leader is a cerebral villain  it would allow them to reinterpret the Hulk himself  100 Ty Burrell wants to portray the superpowered Doc Samson faithfully to the comics  99  Norton said   The whole thing was to envision it in multiple parts  We left a lot out on purpose  The Incredible Hulk is definitely intended as chapter one   13  Leterrier made the film s final shot of Banner ambiguous  the thought being if there is a sequel  it would mean Banner finally masters control over his anger  if there is not a sequel  the shot indicates instead that in the scheduled 2012 feature The Avengers  he becomes a menace  101  Leterrier had also intended for a scene in the credits showing Blonsky  human once more  imprisoned and chained in a box  102  Leterrier and Roth are contracted to return  Leterrier also stated Norton was not signed on  103  but in October 2008  Hurd stated that Norton was contracted to reprise the role  100  The film has outgrossed its predecessor and Universal indicated interest in a sequel  104  However  by July 21  Leterrier believed a sequel would not be made because of the film s box office return  Leterrier is confident that the character will appear in The Avengers  even if Marvel does not ask Norton to fulfill his contract  105  Kevin Feige said the film met Marvel s expectations and that Hulk will return  but after the crossover  106  Hurd is not concerned that a sequel may not be produced until at least 2012  citing the positive reception to the film and having produced the Terminator series  the second and third film of which had a 12 year gap  100  Tim Roth confirmed that Marvel has signed him for three more films  107  Leterrier  after having previously said he did not want to direct a sequel  said in late 2009 he had changed his mind and was now amenable  108  In 2012 s The Avengers  Mark Ruffalo begins his role as Banner Hulk  The short film The Consultant elaborates on Tony Stark s meeting with General Ross which took place in The Incredible Hulk   edit  References    The Incredible Hulk  Release date  13 06 2008   British Board of Film Classification  http   www bbfc co uk
