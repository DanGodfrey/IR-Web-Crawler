Jury From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search This article is about the sworn body of people  For the term referring to  coroner s jury   see inquest  For other uses  see Jury  disambiguation    Jury box  redirects here  For the 1930s parlor game  see Jury Box  game   An empty jury box in a US courtroom A jury is a sworn body of people convened to render an impartial verdict  a finding of fact on a question  officially submitted to them by a court  or to set a penalty or judgment  Modern juries tend to be found in courts to ascertain the guilt  or lack thereof  in a crime  In Anglophone jurisdictions  the verdict may be guilty  not guilty  or  in Scotland  not proven  Juries are composed of jurors  also sometimes known as jurymen   who are by definition layman finders of fact  not professionals  The old institution of grand juries still exist in some places  particularly the United States  to investigate whether enough evidence of a crime exists to bring someone to trial  The jury arrangement has evolved out of the earliest juries  which were found in early medieval England  Members were supposed to inform themselves of crimes and then of the details of the crimes  Their function was therefore closer to that of a grand jury than that of a jury in a trial  Contents 1 Etymology 2 Types of jury 3 Composition 4 Historical roots 4 1 18th century

derives from  Norman  French   jur   sworn    Juries are most common in common law adversarial system jurisdictions  In the modern system  juries act as triers of fact  while judges act as triers of law  A trial without a jury  in which both questions of fact and questions of law are decided by a judge  is known as a bench trial   edit  Types of jury The  petit jury   or  trial jury   hears the evidence in a trial as presented by both the plaintiff  petitioner  and the defendant  respondent   After hearing the evidence and often jury instructions from the judge  the group retires for deliberation  to consider a verdict  The majority required for a verdict varies  In some cases it must be unanimous  while in other jurisdictions it may be a majority or supermajority  A jury that is unable to come to a verdict is referred to as a hung jury  The size of the jury varies  in criminal cases there are usually 12 jurors  although Scotland uses 15  A number of countries that are not in the English common law tradition have quasi juries on which lay judges or jurors and professional judges deliberate together regarding criminal cases  In civil cases many trials require only eight  Juries are almost never used in civil cases outside the United States and Canada  Other states with a common law tradition sometimes use them in defamation cases  in cases involving a governmental eminent domain power  and in cases involving alleged wrongful conviction  Civil law countries generally do not use civil juries  Civil juries are available in theory in the United States and Canada in almost all cases where the only remedy sought is money damages  although in practice they are sought only in large dollar cases  A grand jury  a type of jury now confined almost exclusively to federal courts and some state jurisdictions in the United States  determines whether there is enough evidence for a criminal trial to go forward  Grand juries carry out this duty by examining evidence presented to them by a prosecutor and issuing indictments  or by investigating alleged crimes and issuing presentments  A grand jury is traditionally larger than and distinguishable from the petit jury used during a trial  with at least 12 jurors  A grand jury does not require a suspect be notified of the proceedings  and grand juries can be used for filing charges in the form of a sealed indictment against unaware suspects to be arrested later by a surprise police visit   edit  Composition Serving on a jury is normally compulsory for those individuals who are qualified for jury service  Since a jury is intended to be an impartial panel capable of reaching a verdict  there are often procedures and requirements  for instance  fluent understanding of the language  or the ability to test jurors or otherwise exclude jurors who might be perceived as less than neutral or more partial to hear one side or the other  Juries are initially chosen randomly from the eligible population residing in the court s jurisdictional area  unless a change of venue has occurred   Jury selection varies widely  in the United States  some form of organized questioning of the prospective jurors  jury pool  occurs voir dire before the jury is selected impaneled  A head juror is called the  foreman  or  presiding juror   The foreman is often chosen before the trial begins or upon the beginning of deliberations  The role of the foreman is to ask questions on behalf of the jury  facilitate jury discussions  and sometimes to read the verdict of the jury  Since there is always the possibility of jurors not completing the trial for health or other reasons  often one or more alternate jurors are nominated  Alternates hear the trial but do not take part in deciding the verdict unless a juror is unable to deliberate  In Connecticut  alternate jurors are dismissed before the panel of sworn jurors begin deliberation  Connecticut General Statutes 51 243 e  and 54 82h do not allow alternate jurors to be segregated from the regular sworn jurors  In civil cases in Connecticut  C G S  51 243 e  declares that alternate jurors  shall be dismissed   This differs from the power given to the Court in criminal trials under C G S  54 82h  permitting the Court to not dismiss the alternate jurors  and have the regular jury panel begin deliberations   edit  Historical roots The Jury an 1861 painting of a British jury The modern jury evolved out of the ancient custom of many ancient Germanic tribes whereby a group of men of good character was used to investigate crimes and or judge the accused  The same custom evolved into the vehmic court system in medieval Germany  In Anglo Saxon England  juries investigated crimes  After the Norman Conquest  some parts of the country preserved juries as the means of investigating crimes  The use of ordinary members of the community to consider crimes was unusual in ancient cultures  but was nonetheless also found in ancient Greece  The modern jury trial evolved out of this custom in the mid 12th century during the reign of Henry II  1  Juries  usually 6 or 12 men  were an  ancient institution  in some parts of England    Henry II  286  Members consisted of representatives of the basic units of local government hundreds  an administrative sub division of the shire  embracing several vills  and villages  Called juries of presentment  these men testified under oath to crimes committed in their neighborhood and indicted  The Assize of Clarendon in 1166 caused these juries to be adopted systematically throughout the country  The jury in this period was  self informing   meaning it heard very little evidence or testimony in court  Instead  jurors were recruited from the locality of the dispute and were expected to know the facts before coming to court  The source of juror knowledge could include first hand knowledge  investigation  and less reliable sources such as rumor and hearsay  2  Between 1166 and 1179 new procedures including a division of functions between the sheriff  the jury of local men  and the royal justices ushered in the era of the English Common Law  Sheriffs prepared cases for trial and found jurors with relevant knowledge and testimony  Jurors  found  a verdict by witnessing as to fact  even assessing and apply information from their own and community memory   little was written at this time and what was  deeds  writs  were subject to fraud  Royal justices supervised trials  answered questions as to law and announced the court s decision which was subject to appeal  Sheriffs executed the decision  These procedures enabled Henry II to delegate authority without endowing his subordinates with too much power    Henry II  293  In 1215 the Roman Catholic Church removed its sanction from all forms of ordeal   procedures by which suspects were  tested  as to guilt  e g   the ordeal of hot metal was applied to a suspected thief by pouring molten metal into his hand  if the wound healed rapidly and well  it was believed God found the suspect innocent  if not then guilty   With the ordeals banned  establishing guilt would have been problematic  had England not had forty years of judicial experience  Justices were accustomed to asking jurors of presentment about points of fact in assessing indictments  it was a short step to ask jurors if the accused was guilty as charged    Henry II  358  An early reference to a jury type group in England is in a decree issued by Aethelred at Wantage  997   which enacted that in every Hundred  the twelve leading thegns together with the reeve shall go out and swear on the relics which are given into their hands  that they will not accuse any innocent man nor shield a guilty one   3  The resulting Wantage Code code formally recognized legal customs that were part of the Danelaw  4  The testimonial concept can also be traced to Normandy before 1066  when a jury of nobles was established to decide land disputes  In this manner  the Duke  being the largest land owner  could not act as a judge in his own case  5  One of the earliest antecedents of modern jury systems are juries in ancient Greece  including the city state of Athens  where records of jury courts date back to 500 BCE  These voted by secret ballot and were eventually granted the power to annul unconstitutional laws  thus introducing judicial review  In modern systems  law is  self contained  and  distinct from other coercive forces  and perceived as separate from the political life of the community   but  all these barriers are absent in the context of classical Athens  In practice and in conception the law and its administration are in some important respects indistinguishable from the life of the community in general   6   edit  18th century England In 1730  the British Parliament passed the Bill for Better Regulation of Juries  7  The Act stipulated that the list of all those liable for jury service was to be posted in each parish and that jury panels would be selected by lot  also known as sortition  from these lists  Its aim was to prevent middle class citizens from evading their responsibilities by financially putting into question the neutrality of the under sheriff  the official entrusted with impanelling juries  Prior to the Act  the main means of ensuring impartiality was by allowing legal challenges to the sheriff s choices  The new provisions did not specifically aim at establishing impartiality  but had the effect of reinforcing the authority of the jury by guaranteeing impartiality at the point of selection  The example of early 18th century England legal reform shows how civic lotteries can be used to organize the duties and responsibilities of the citizen body in relation to the state  It established the impartiality and neutrality of juries as well as reiterating the dual nature of the citizen state relationship     edit  Trial jury size About 50 prospective jurors awaiting jury selection The size of the jury is to provide a  cross section  of the public  In Williams v  Florida  399 U S  78  1970   the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that a Florida state jury of six was sufficient  and that  the 12 man panel is not a necessary ingredient of  trial by jury   and that respondent s refusal to impanel more than the six members provided for by Florida law did not violate petitioner s Sixth Amendment rights as applied to the States through the Fourteenth   8  In Brownlee v The Queen  2001  207 CLR 278  the High Court of Australia unanimously held that a jury of 12 members was not an essential feature of  trial by jury  in section 80 of the Australian Constitution  In Scotland  a jury in a criminal trial consists of 15 jurors  which is thought to be the largest in the world  In 2009 a review by the Scottish Government regarding the possibility of reduction  9  led to the decision to retain 15 jurors  with the Secretary for Justice stating that after extensive consultation  he had decided that Scotland had got it  uniquely right   10  For juries to fulfill their role to analyze the facts of the case  there are strict rules about their use of information during the trial  Juries are often instructed to avoid learning about the case from any source other than the trial  such as from media accounts  and to not attempt to conduct their own investigations  such as independently visiting a crime scene   Parties  lawyers  and witnesses are not allowed to speak with a member of the jury  Doing these things may constitute reversible error  In very rare  high profile cases  juries may be sequestered for the deliberation phase or for the entire trial  Conversely  jurors are generally required to keep their deliberations in strict confidence during the trial and deliberations  and in some jurisdictions even after a verdict is rendered  In English law  the jury s deliberations must never be disclosed outside the jury  even years after the case  to repeat parts of the trial or verdict  is considered to be contempt of court  a criminal offense  In the United States  this rule usually does not apply  and sometimes jurors have made remarks that called into question whether a verdict was properly arrived at  In Australia  academics are permitted to scrutinize the jury process only after obtaining a certificate or approval from the Attorney General  Because of the desire to prevent undue influence on a jury  jury tampering  like witness tampering  is a serious crime  whether attempted through bribery  threat of violence  or other means  Jurors themselves can also be held liable if they deliberately compromise their impartiality  A study by the University of Glasgow showed that a jury of 12 people was ineffective because a few jurors ended up dominating the discussion  and that seven was a better number because more people feel comfortable speaking  and they have an easier time reaching a unanimous decision  11   edit  Role The role of the jury is seemingly accurate to a finder of fact  while the judge is seen as having the sole responsibility of interpreting the appropriate law and instructing the jury accordingly  The jury will render a verdict on the defendant s guilt  or civil liability  Sometimes a jury will also make specific findings of fact in what is called a  special verdict   A verdict without specific findings of fact that includes only findings of guilt  civil liability and an overall amount of civil damages  if awarded  is called a  general verdict   Juries are often justified because they leaven the law with community norms  12  Jury trial verdicts are not  however  legally binding precedents in other cases  For example  it would be possible for one jury to find that particular conduct is negligent  and another jury to find that it is not negligent  without either verdict being legally invalid  on precisely the same factual evidence  Occasionally  if jurors find the law to be invalid or unfair  they may acquit the defendant  regardless of the evidence that the defendant violated the law  This is commonly referred to as  jury nullification of law  or simply jury nullification  When there is no jury   bench trial    the judge makes rulings on both questions of law and of fact  In most continental European jurisdictions  the judges have more power in a trial and the role and powers of a jury are often restricted  Actual jury law and trial procedures differ between countries  The collective knowledge and deliberate nature of juries are also given as reasons in their favor  Detailed interviews with jurors after they rendered verdicts in trials involving complex expert testimony have demonstrated careful and critical analysis  The interviewed jurors clearly recognized that the experts were selected within an adversary process  They employed sensible techniques to evaluate the experts  testimony  such as assessing the completeness and consistency of the testimony  comparing it with other evidence at the trial  and evaluating it against their own knowledge and life experience  Moreover  the research shows that in deliberations jurors combine their individual perspectives on the evidence and debate its relative merits before arriving at a verdict  13  In the United States  juries are also entitled  when asked to do so by a judge in their jury instructions  to make factual findings on particular aggravating circumstances which will be used to elevate the defendant s sentence  if the defendant is convicted  This practice was required in all death penalty cases in Blakely v  Washington  542 U S  296  2004   where the Supreme Court ruled that allowing judges to make such findings unilaterally violates the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial  A similar Sixth Amendment argument in Apprendi v  New Jersey  530 U S  466  2000  expanded the requirement to all cases  holding that  any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt   14  Many U S  jurisdictions permit the seating of an advisory jury in a civil case in which there is no right to trial by jury to provide non binding advice to the trial judge  15  although this procedural tool is rarely used  For example  a judge might seat an advisory jury to guide the judge in awarding non economic damages in a case where there is no right to a jury trial  such as a personal injury suit brought against a state government  In Canada  juries are also allowed to make suggestions for sentencing periods and at the time of sentencing  the suggestions of the jury are presented before the judge by the Crown prosecutor s  before the sentence is handed down  A small number of U S  jurisdictions  including Texas  give juries the right to set sentences as well as to find guilt or innocence  However  this is not the practice in most other legal systems based on the English tradition  in which judges retain sole responsibility for deciding sentences according to law  The exception is the award of damages in English law libel cases  although a judge is now obliged to make a recommendation to the jury as to the appropriate amount  In legal systems based on English tradition  findings of fact by a jury and jury conclusions that could be supported by jury findings of fact when the specific factual basis for the verdict is not known  are entitled to great deference on appeal  In other legal systems  it is generally possible to reconsidered both findings of fact and findings of law made at the trial court level and evidence may be presented to appellate courts in what amounts to a trial de novo of appealled findings of fact made by the court of first instance in a case  The finality of trial court findings of fact in legal systems based on the English tradition has major impact on court procedure in these systems  This finality makes it imperative that lawyers be highly prepared for trial in the first instance in high stakes cases with jury trials based on the English tradition  because errors and misjudgments related to the presentation of evidence at trial to a jury cannot generally be corrected later on appeal  Surprises at trial are much more consequential in jury trials in systems based on the English tradition than they are in other legal systems as a result  so in these systems trial preparation to avoid any possibility of surprise is more important than it might be otherwise   edit  Jury nullification Main article  Jury nullification Jury nullification means making a law void by jury decision  in other words  the process whereby a jury in a criminal case effectively nullifies a law by acquitting a defendant regardless of the weight of evidence against him or her   16  In the 17th and 18th centuries there were a series of cases starting in 1670 with the trial of the Quaker William Penn which asserted the  de facto  right of a jury to pass a verdict contrary to the facts or law  A good example is the case of one Carnegie of Finhaven who in 1728 accidentally killed the Scottish Earl of Strathmore  As the defendant had undoubtedly killed the Earl  the law  as it stood  required the jury to pass the verdict that the case had been  proven  and cause Carnegie of Finhaven to die for an accidental killing  Instead the jury asserted what it believed to be their  ancient right  to judge the whole case and not just the facts and brought in the verdict of  not guilty   This led to the development of the not proven verdict in Scots law  Today in the United States  juries are instructed by the judge to follow his or her instructions concerning what is the  law   in his or her opinion  and to render a verdict solely on the evidence presented in court  If it reaches a conclusion contrary to those instructions  but based on its own beliefs as to what the law is  whether it has been properly applied  or whether it should be the law  this is known as jury nullification  It finds its most common expression when verdicts are rendered based on passion  prejudice  sympathy or bias  It has been asserted that the jury has the power to  nullify  a law it believes is unjust  by  for example  refusing to find the defendant guilty  in spite of the evidence  if it believes that a guilty verdict would be unjust  Important past exercises of this de facto power include cases involving slavery  see Fugitive Slave Act of 1850   freedom of the press  see John Peter Zenger   and freedom of religion  see William Penn   In United States v  Moylan  417 F 2d 1002  4th  Cir  1969   Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal unanimously ruled   If the jury feels that the law under which the defendant is accused is unjust  or exigent circumstances justified the actions of the accused  or for any reason which appeals to their logic or passion  the jury has the right to acquit  and the courts must abide that decision   The Fully Informed Jury Association is a non profit educational organization dedicated to informing jurors of their rights and seeks laws to force judges to inform jurors that they can and should judge the law  In Sparf v  United States  156 U S  51  1895   the Supreme Court  in a 5 4 decision  held that a trial judge has no responsibility to inform the jury of the right to nullify laws  Modern American jurisprudence is generally intolerant of the practice  and a juror can be removed from a case if the judge believes that the juror is aware of the power of nullification  17   edit  Jury equity In the United Kingdom  a similar power exists  often called  jury equity   This enables a jury to reach a decision in direct contradiction with the law if they feel the law is unjust  This can create a persuasive precedent for future cases  or render prosecutors reluctant to bring a charge   thus a jury has the power to influence the law  Perhaps the best example of modern day jury equity in England and Wales was the acquittal of Clive Ponting  on a charge of revealing secret information  under section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 in 1985  Mr Ponting s defence was that the revelation was in the public interest  The trial judge directed the jury that  the public interest is what the government of the day says it is    effectively a direction to the jury to convict  Nevertheless  the jury returned a verdict of not guilty  Another example is the acquittal in 1989 of Michael Randle and Pat Pottle  who confessed in open court to charges of springing the Soviet spy George Blake from Wormwood Scrubs Prison and smuggling him to East Germany in 1966  Pottle successfully appealed to the jury to disregard the judge s instruction that they consider only whether the defendants were guilty in law  and assert a jury s ancient right to throw out a politically motivated prosecution  in this case compounded by its cynical untimeliness  18  In Scotland  with a separate legal system from that of England and Wales  although technically the  not guilty  verdict was originally a form of jury nullification  over time the interpretation has changed so that now the  not guilty  verdict has become the normal one when a jury is not persuaded of guilt and the  not proven  verdict is only used when the jury is not certain of innocence or guilt  19  It is absolutely central to Scottish and English law that there is a presumption of innocence  It is not a trivial distinction since any shift in the burden of proof is a significant change which undermines the safeguard for the citizen  20   edit  Advantages and Disadvantages of a jury system  edit  Advantages of a jury system As there are many persons from different backgrounds  any individual prejudices are likely to cancel out  Juries represent the common public and therefore are more likely to judge in line with generally accepted values of the society  Discussions among juries are likely to lead to more thorough consideration of all aspects of the case  It is more difficult to corrupt 12 jurors though than one  or three  judge s    edit  Disadvantages of a jury system The jury members are with a few exceptions not knowledgeable about the law and are unfamiliar with court procedure  decisions might be based on emotions rather than rationale arguing  Complex cases tend to require special expertise to judge the case which a jury do not have  The jury members are more susceptible to the rhetoric impressions and mesmerised by the eloquence of a lawyer than a judge  they tend to be over awed by the whole experience  Since the decision by jury is a group decision  individual members of the jury may not feel that responsible about their duties and therefore neglect it  Group pressure might be influential on the decision  Juries may be swayed by the current prejudices in the society  which are not supported by law  A jury system is very costly   edit  Non trial juries A wine jury Besides petit juries for jury trials and grand juries for issuing indictments  juries are sometimes used in non legal or quasi legal contexts  Blue ribbon juries attend to civic matters as an ad hoc body in the executive branch of a government  Outside government  a jury or panel of judges may make determinations in competition  such as at a wine tasting  art exhibition  or talent contest  These types of contests are juried competitions  Blue ribbon juries are juries selected from prominent  well educated citizens  sometimes to investigate a particular problem such as civic corruption  Blue ribbon juries cannot be used in real trials  which require constitutional safeguards to produce a jury of one s peers  The blue ribbon jury is intended to overcome the problems of ordinary juries in interpreting complex technical or commercial questions  In the United States blue ribbon juries were provided for by statutes  the terms varying by jurisdiction   edit  Trial procedures  edit  Australia  edit  States Each State may determine the extent to which the use of a Jury is used  The use of a Jury is optional for civil trials in any Australian State  citation needed  The use of a Jury in criminal trials is generally by unanimous verdict of 12 lay members of the public  Some States provide exceptions such as majority  11 to 1 or 10 to 2  verdicts where a jury cannot otherwise reach a verdict  Sometimes a State law may allow an accused person to elect to use a Judge only trial rather than the default Jury provision   edit  Commonwealth  Federal  The Constitution of Australia provides in section 80 that  the trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury   The Commonwealth can determine which offences are  on indictment   Cheng v The Queen  2000  203 CLR 248  McHugh and Callinan JJ  Kirby J dissenting   It would be entirely consistent with the Constitution that a Homicide offence could be tried not  on indictment   or conversely that a simple Assault could be tried  on indictment   This interpretation has been criticised a  mockery  of the section  rendering it useless  R v Federal Court of Bankruptcy  Ex parte Lowenstein  1939  59 CLR 556  Dixon and Evatt JJ dissenting   Where a trial  on indictment  has been prescribed  it is an essential element that it be found by a unanimous verdict of guilty by 12 lay members of the public  This requirement stems from the  historical  meaning of  jury  at the time that the Constitution was written and is  in principle  thus an integral element of trial by jury Cheatle v The Queen  1993  177 CLR 541  per curiam   Unlike States  an accused person cannot elect a Judge only trial   edit  Belgium The Belgian Constitution provides that all cases involving the most serious crimes be judged by juries  As a safeguard against libel cases  press crimes can also only be tried by jury  Racism is excluded from this safeguard  Twelve jurors decide by majority whether the defendant is guilty or not  A tied vote results in  not guilty   a  7 guilty   5 not guilty  vote is transferred to the 3 professional judges who can  by unanimity  reverse the majority to  not guilty   The sentence is delivered by a majority of the 12 jurors and the 3 professional judges  21  As a result of the Taxquet ruling the juries give nowadays the most important motives that lead them to their verdict  The procedural codification has been altered to meet the demands formulated by the European Court of Human Rights   edit  Brazil The Constitution of Brazil provides that only willful crimes against life  namely full or attempted murder  abortion  infanticide and suicide instigation  be judged by juries  Seven jurors vote in secret to decide whether the defendant is guilty or not  and decisions are taken by majority  Manslaughter and other crimes in which the killing was committed without intent  however  are judged by a professional judge instead   edit  Canada In Canada  juries are used for some criminal trials but not others  For summary conviction offences 22  or offences found under section 553 of the Criminal Code of Canada  the trial is before a judge alone  For most indictable offences  the accused person can elect to be tried by either a judge alone or a judge and jury  23  In the most serious offences  found in section 469 of the Criminal Code of Canada  such as murder or treason   a judge and a jury are always used  unless both the accused and the prosecutor agree that the trial should not be in front of a jury  24  The jury s verdict on the ultimate disposition of guilt or innocence must be unanimous  25  but can disagree on the evidentiary route that leads to that disposition  26  27  Juries do not make a recommendation as to the length of sentence  except for parole ineligibility for second degree murder  but the judge is not bound by the jury s recommendation  and the jury is not required to make a recommendation   25  Jury selection is in accordance with specific criteria  Prospective jurors may only be asked certain questions  selected for direct pertinence to impartiality or other relevant matters  Any other questions must be approved by the judge  A jury in a criminal trial is initially composed of 12 jurors  There are no substitute jurors  Instead  if a juror is discharged during the course of the trial  the trial will continue unless the number of jurors goes below 10  25  The Canadian constitution guarantees that anyone tried for an offence that has a maximum sentence of five or more years has the right to be tried by a jury  except for an offence under military law   The names of jurors are protected by a publication ban  There is a specific criminal offence for disclosing anything that takes place during jury deliberations  25  Juries are infrequently used in civil trials in Canada  Because juries have no power to award damages  as they do in the United States  there is less incentive to call for a trial with a jury  For further reading  Jury Trial in Canada  edit  England and Wales Main article  Juries in England and Wales In England and Wales jury trials are used for criminal cases  requiring 12  between the ages of 18 and 70  jurors  The right to a jury trial has been enshrined in English law since Magna Carta in 1215  and is most common in the serious cases  although the defendant can insist on a jury trial for most criminal matters  Jury trials have been described as expensive and time consuming in complex fraud cases by some members and appointees of the Labour Party  28  In contrast  the Bar Council  Liberty and other political parties have supported the idea that trial by jury is at the heart of the judicial system and placed the blame for a few complicated jury trials failing on inadequate preparation by the prosecution  29  On 18 June 2009 the Lord Chief Justice  Lord Judge  sitting in the Court of Appeal  made English legal history by ruling that a criminal trial in the Crown Court could take place without a jury  30  Jury trials are also available for some few areas of civil law  for example cases involving police conduct   which require 10 jurors not 12  but less than one percent of civil trials involve juries  31  At the new Manchester Civil Justice Centre  constructed in 2008  of the 48 courtrooms  fewer than 10 had jury facilities   edit  France  edit  In the Cour d assises Nine  in first instance proceedings  or twelve  in appeal proceedings  jurors sit around three judges  The judges  opinion adds up to the one of the jury to definitely convict the defendant  with a majority of seven  in first instance  or nine  in appeal  needed in order to convict the defendant  During these procedures  judges and jurors have equal positions on questions of facts  while judges decide on questions of procedure  Judges and jurors have also equal positions on sentencing   edit  Germany Trial by jury was introduced in most German states after the revolutionary events of 1848  however  it remained controversial and early in the 20th century there were moves to abolish it  32  The Emminger Reform of January 4  1924  during an Article 48 state of emergency  abolished the jury system and replaced it with a mixed system including bench trials and lay judges  In 1925 the Social Democrats called for the restitution of the jury  and a special meeting of the German Bar demanded revocation of the decrees  but  on the whole the abolition of the jury caused little commotion   33  Their verdicts were widely perceived as unjust and inconsistent  Today  most misdemeanors are tried by a Strafrichter  meaning a single judge at an Amtsgericht  felonys and more severe misdemeanors are tried by a Sch ffengericht  also located at the Amtsgericht  composed of 1 judge and 2 lay judges  some felonies are heard by Erweitertes Sch ffengericht  or extended Sch ffengericht  composed of 2 judges and 2 lay judges  severe felonies and other  special  crimes are tried by the gro e Strafkammer  composed of 3 judges and 2 lay judges at the Landgericht  with specially assigned courts for some crimes called Sonderstrafkammer  felonies resulting in the death of a human being are tried by the Schwurgericht  composed of 3 judges and 2 lay judges  located at the Landgericht  and serious crimes against the state are tried by the Strafsenat  composed of 5 judges  at an Oberlandesgericht  34  In some civil cases  such as commercial law or patent law  there are also lay judges  who have to meet certain criteria  e g  being a merchant    edit  Hong Kong Main article  Jury system in Hong Kong The Hong Kong Basic Law  Article 86  assures the practice of jury trials  Most serious criminal cases and some civil cases are tried by jury in Hong Kong  In addition  from time to time  the Coroner s Court may summon a jury to decide the cause of death in an inquest  Criminal cases are normally tried by a 7 person jury and sometimes  at the discretion of the court  a 9 person jury  Nevertheless  the Jury Ordinance requires that a jury in any proceedings should be composed of at least 5 jurors  Although Article 86 of the Basic Law states that  the principle of trial by jury previously practised in Hong Kong shall be maintained   it does not guarantee that every case is to be tried by jury  In Chiang Lily v  Secretary for Justice  2010   the Court of Final Appeal agreed that  there is no right to trial by jury in Hong Kong    edit  India Juries were formerly used in India up until the famous KM Nanavati v State of Maharashtra  1959   which led to the abolition of jury trials  although minor issues in rural areas are still handled by the panchayat raj system of village assemblies  In the Nanavati case  Kawas Manekshaw Nanavati was tried for the murder of his wife Sylvia s paramour  Prem Ahuja  The incident shocked the nation  got unprecedented media coverage  and inspired several books and movies  The case was the last jury trial held in India  The central question of the case was whether the gun went off accidentally or whether it was a premeditated murder  In the former scenario  Nanavati would be charged under the Indian penal code  for culpable homicide  with a maximum punishment of 10 years  In the latter  he would be charged with murder  with the sentence being death or life imprisonment  Nanavati pleaded not guilty  His defence team argued it was a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder  while the prosecution argued it was premeditated murder  The jury in the Greater Bombay sessions court pronounced Nanavati not guilty with an 8 1 verdict  The sessions judge considered the acquittal as perverse and referred the case to the high court  The prosecution argued that the jury had been misled by the presiding judge on four crucial points  One  the onus of proving that it was an accident and not premeditated murder was on Nanavati  Two  was Sylvia s confession of the grave provocation for Nanavati  or any specific incident in Ahuja s bedroom or both  Three  the judge wrongly told the jury that the provocation can also come from a third person  And four  the jury was not instructed that Nanavati s defence had to be proved  to the extent that there is no reasonable doubt in the mind of a reasonable person  The court accepted the arguments  dismissed the jury s verdict and the case was freshly heard in the high court  Since the jury had also been influenced by media and public support for Nanavati and was also open to being misled  the Indian government abolished jury trials after the case   edit  Ireland  edit  History of juries in Ireland Juries were introduced into Ireland as part of the transplantation of common law   edit  Modern Irish juries In Ireland  a common law jurisdiction jury trials are available for criminal before the Circuit Court  Central Criminal Court and defamation cases  Consisting of twelve persons  juries are selected from a jury panel which is picked at random by the county registrar from the electoral register  Juries only decide questions of fact  They have no role in criminal sentencing or awarding damages in libel cases  It is not necessary that a jury be unanimous in its verdict  In civil cases  a verdict may be reached by a majority of nine of the twelve members  In a criminal case  a verdict need not be unanimous where there are not fewer than eleven jurors if ten of them agree on a verdict after considering the case for a  reasonable time   For certain terrorist and organised crime offences the Director of Public Prosecutions may issue a certificate that the accused be tried by the Special Criminal Court  Instead of a jury the Special Criminal Court consists of three judges  one from the District Court  Circuit Court and High Court  The constitutional provisions regulating the Trial of Offences are set out in article 37 of the Irish Constitution  DPP v McNally sets out that a jury has the right to reach a not guilty verdict even in direct contradiction of the evidence  The principal statute regulating the selection  obligations and conduct of juries is the Juries Act 1976 as amended by the Civil Law  Miscellaneous Provisions  Act 2008  which scrapped the upper age limit of 70  Juries are not paid  nor do they receive travel expenses  however they do receive lunch for the days that they are serving  In 2010  the Irish Law Reform Commission published a Consultation Paper on Jury Service  and proposed reforms are expected by 2011   edit  Italy In Italy  a Civil law jurisdiction  untrained judges are present only in the Corte d Assise  where two career magistrates are supported by six so called Lay Judges  who are raffled from the registrar of voters  Any Italian citizen  with no distinction of sex or religion  between 30 and 65 years of age  can be appointed as a lay judge  in order to be eligible as a lay judge for the Corte d Assise  however  there is a minimum educational requirement  as the lay judge must have completed his her education at the Scuola Media  junior high school  level  while said level is raised for the Corte d Assise d Appello  appeal level of the Corte d Assise  to the Scuola Superiore  senior high school  degree  In the Corte d Assise  decisions both fact and law matters are taken by the stipendiary judges and  Lay Judges  together at a special meeting behind closed doors  named Camera di Consiglio   Counsel Chamber    and the Court is subsequently required to publish written explanations of its decisions within 90 days from the verdict  Errors of law or inconsistencies in the explanation of a decision can and usually will lead to the annulment of the decision  A Court d Assise and a Court d  Assise d Appello decides on a majority of votes  and therefore predominantly on the votes of the lay judges  who are a majority of six to two  but in actual fact lay judges  who are not trained to write such explanation and must rely on one or the other stipendiary judge to do it  are effectively prevented from overruling both of them  The Corte d Assise has jurisdiction to try crimes carrying a maximum penalty of 24 years in prison or life imprisonment  and other serious crimes  felonies that fall under its jurisdiction include terrorism  murder  manslaughter  severe attempts against State personalities  as well as some matters of law requiring ethical and professional evaluations  ex  assisted suicide   while it generally has no jurisdiction over cases whose evaluation requires knowledges of Law which the  Lay Judges  generally don t have  Penalties imposed by the court can include life sentences   edit  New Zealand Juries are used in trials for all indictable offences and  at the option of the defendant  summary offences that can be punished with more than 3 months in prison  In civil cases juries are usually only used in cases of defamation  Previously requiring unanimous support  New Zealand now permits majority results of 10 1 or 11 1  35   edit  Northern Ireland During the Troubles in Northern Ireland  jury trials were suspended and trials took place before Diplock Courts  These were essentially trials before judges only  This was to combat the intimidation of juries  citation needed   edit  Norway The jury was introduced in 1887  and is solely used in criminal cases on the second tier of the three tier Norwegian court system   Lagmannsretten    The jury consists of 10 people  and has to reach a majority verdict consisting of seven or more of the jurors  36  The jury never gives a reason for its verdict  rather it simply gives a  guilty  or  non guilty  verdict  In a sense  the concept of being judged by one s peers exists on both the first and second tier of the Norwegian court system  In Tingretten  one judge and two lay judges preside  and in Lagmannsretten three judges and four lay judges preside  if a jury is not used   The lay judges do not hold any legal qualification  and represent the peers of the person on trial  as members of the general public  As a guarantee against any abuse of power by the educated elite  the number of lay judges always exceeds the number of appointed judges  In the Supreme Court  only trained lawyers are seated   edit  Scotland Scottish trials are based on an adversarial approach  First the prosecution leads evidence from witnesses and after each witness the defence has an opportunity to cross examine  Following the Prosecution case  the defence may move a motion of no case to answer if the worst the prosecution has been able to lead in evidence would be insufficient to convict of any crime  If there remains a case to answer  the defence leads evidence from witnesses in an attempt to refute previous evidence led by the prosecution  with cross examination being permitted after each witness  Once both prosecution and defence have concluded leading evidence  the case goes to summing up where firstly the prosecution and then the defence get to sum up their case based on the evidence that has been heard  The jury is given guidance on points of law and then sent out to consider its verdict  Juries are composed of fifteen residents  37   edit  Spain Spain had no established tradition of using juries in trials  but the Constitution of 1978  legislates the right to a trial by jury  called  popular jury  as opposed to a  magistrates jury   The provision is arguably somewhat vague   Section 125   Citizens may engage in popular action and take part in the administration of justice through the institution of the jury  in the manner and with respect to those criminal trials as may be determined by law  as well as in customary and traditional courts   Jury trials have been very slowly introduced in Spain and have often produced less than desirable results  citation needed  One of the first cases was that of Mikel Otegi who was tried in 1997 for the murder of two police officers  After a confused clarification needed  trial  five jury members of a total of nine voted to acquit and the judge ordered the accused set free  This verdict shocked the nation  38  Another alleged miscarriage of justice by jury trial was the Wanninkhof murder case   edit  Sweden Sweden has no tradition of using juries in most types of criminal or civil trial  The sole exception  since 1815  is in cases involving freedom of the press  prosecuted under Chapter 7 of the Freedom of the Press Act  part of Sweden s constitution  39   The most frequently prosecuted offence under this act is defamation  although in total eighteen offences  including high treason and espionage  are covered  These cases are tried in district courts  first tier courts  by a jury of nine laymen  The jury in press freedom cases rules only on the facts of the case and the question of guilt or innocence  The trial judge may overrule a jury s guilty verdict  but may not overrule an acquittal  A conviction requires a majority verdict of 6 3  Sentencing is the sole prerogative of judges  Jury members must be Swedish citizens and resident in the county in which the case is being heard  They must be of sound judgement  independent and upstanding  They are appointed by each county council for a period of four years  and may serve in multiple cases during that period  40    Juries are not used in other criminal and civil cases  For most other cases in the first and second tier courts lay judges sit alongside professional judges  Lay judges participate in deciding both the facts of the case and sentencing  Lay judges are appointed by local authorities  or in practice by the political parties represented on the authorities 41   Lay judges are therefore usually selected from among political activists   edit  United States Main article  Juries in the United States In criminal law in United States  in federal courts and in a minority of state court systems  a grand jury is convened to hear only testimony and evidence to determine whether there is a case to be answered and hence whether the accused should be indicted and sent for trial  In each court district where a grand jury is required  a group of 16 23 citizens holds an inquiry on criminal complaints brought by the prosecutor and decides if a trial is warranted  based on the standard that probable cause that a crime was committed exists   in which case an indictment is issued  In general  the size of juries tends to be larger if the crime alleged is more serious  If a grand jury rejects a proposed indictment it is known as a  no bill   if they accept to endorse a proposed indictment it is known as a  true bill   Grand jury proceedings are ex parte  only the prosecutor may present evidence to the grand jury and defendants are not allowed to present mitigating evidence or even to know the testimony that was presented to the grand jury  and hearsay evidence is permitted  Grand juries vote to indict in the overwhelming majority of cases  and prosecutors are not prohibited from presenting the same case to a new grand jury if a  no bill  was returned by a previous grand jury  A typical grand jury considers a new criminal case every fifteen minutes  In some jurisdictions  in addition to indicting people for crimes  a grand jury may also issue reports on matters that they investigate apart from the criminal indictments that it produces  particularly when the grand jury investigation involves a public scandal  Historically  grand juries were sometimes used in American law to serve a purpose similar to an investigatory commission  Both Article III of the U S  Constitution and the Sixth Amendment require that criminal cases be tried by a jury  42  and the Fourteenth Amendment applies this mandate to the states  Although the initial draft did not require a jury for civil cases  this led to an uproar which was followed by the Seventh Amendment  which requires a civil jury in cases where the value in dispute is greater than twenty dollars  43  However  the Seventh Amendment right to a civil jury trial does not apply in state courts  where the right to a jury is strictly a matter of state law  44  But  in practice  all states but Louisiana  preserve the right to a jury trial in almost all civil cases where the sole remedy sought is money damages to the same extent as jury trials are permitted by the 7th Amendment  although sometimes jury trials are not allowed in small claims cases  The civil jury in the United States is a defining element of the process by which personal injury trials are handled in the United States  In practice most criminal actions in the U S  are resolved by plea bargain  45  and only about 2  of civil cases go to trial  with only about half of those trials being conducted before juries  In 1898 the Supreme Court held that the jury must be composed of at least twelve persons  although this was not necessarily extended to state civil jury trials  43  In 1970  however  the Supreme Court held that the twelve persons requirement was a  historical accident   and upheld six person juries in both criminal and civil cases  There is controversy over smaller juries  with proponents arguing that they are more efficient and opponents arguing that they lead to fluctuating verdicts  43  In later case  however  the court rejected the use of 5 person juries in criminal cases  43  Juries go through a selection process called voir dire in which the lawyers question the jurors and then make  peremptory strikes   remove jurors   Traditionally the removal of jurors required no justification or explanation  but the tradition has been challenged by the Supreme Court  Since the 1970s  scientific jury selection  has become popular  43  Unanimous jury verdicts have been standard in Western law  This standard was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1897  but it was rejected in 1972 in two criminal cases  As of 1999 over thirty states had laws allowing less than unanimity in civil cases  but Oregon and Louisiana are the only states which have laws allowing less than unanimous jury verdicts for criminal cases  43  When the required number of jurors cannot agree on a verdict  a situation sometimes referred to as a hung jury   a mistrial is declared  and the case may be retried with a newly constituted jury  The practice generally was that the jury rules only on questions of facts on guilt  setting the penalty was reserved for the judge  This has not been changed by rulings of the U S  Supreme Court such as in Ring v  Arizona  536 U S  284  2002   which found Arizona s practice  having the judge decide on aggravating factors making a defendant eligible for the death penalty  to be unconstitutional  and reserved that decision for the jury  However  in some states  such as Alabama or Florida   the ultimate decision on the punishment is made by the judge  and the jury gives only a non binding recommendation  The judge can impose the death penalty even if the jury recommends life without parole  46  There is no set format for jury deliberations  and the jury will take a period of time to settle into discussing the evidence  Electing a foreman is usually the first step  although for a particularly short or straightforward case  this may not happen until the delivery of the verdict  If a foreman is elected at the beginning  he or she will chair the discussions  The first step will typically be to find out the initial feeling or reaction to the case  which may be by a show of hands  or via secret ballot  The jury will then attempt to arrive at a consensus verdict  The exchanges of views caused by people whose opinions differ from the emerging consensus will air the issues involved in the case  and consequently points will often arise from the trial that were not specifically discussed during it  The result of these discussions is likely to be that one interpretation is shown to be the most reasonable  and a verdict is thus achieved  In civil cases  a petit jury determines liability and damages based upon jury instructions provided by the judge  In criminal cases  after it is determined that a case will proceed to trial  a separate petit jury  formed of petit jurors  is then convened to hear the trial  In a few states and in death penalty cases  depending upon the law  a third jury or more often the same jury  will determine what the penalty should be or recommend what the penalty should be in the penalty phase  Usually  however  sentencing will be handled by the judge at a separate hearing  At a sentencing hearing  the burden of proof is now preponderance of the evidence  not proof beyond a reasonable doubt and hearsay is allowed  This practice gives the judge the power to change the finding of the jury when deciding on a sentence  47  When used alone the term jury usually refers to a petit jury  rather than a grand jury   edit  Jury selection Main article  Jury selection Jurors are selected from a jury pool formed for a specified period of time usually from one day to two weeks from lists of citizens living in the jurisdiction of the court  The lists may be electoral rolls  i e   a list of registered voters in the locale   people who have driver s licenses or other relevant data bases  When selected  being a member of a jury pool is  in principle  compulsory  Prospective jurors are sent a summons and are obligated to appear in a specified jury pool room on a specified date  However  jurors can be released from the pool for several reasons including illness  prior commitments that can t be abandoned without hardship  change of address to outside the court s jurisdiction  travel or employment outside the jurisdiction at the time of duty  and others  Often jurisdictions pay token amounts for jury duty and many issue stipends to cover transportation expenses for jurors  Work places cannot penalize employees who serve jury duty  Payments to jurors varies by jurisdiction  48  In the United States jurors for grand juries are selected from jury pools  Selection of jurors from a jury pool occurs when a trial is announced and juror names are randomly selected and called out by the jury pool clerk  Depending on the type of trial whether a 6 person or 12 person jury is needed  in the United States anywhere from 15 to 30 prospective jurors are sent to the courtroom to participate in voir dire  pronounced  vwa  di   in French  and defined as the oath to speak the truth in the examination testing competence of a juror  or in another application  a witness  Once the list of prospective jurors has assembled in the courtroom the court clerk assigns them seats in the order their names were originally drawn  At this point the judge often will ask each prospective juror to answer a list of general questions such as name  occupation  education  family relationships  time conflicts for the anticipated length of the trial  The list is usually written up and clearly visible to assist nervous prospective jurors and may include several questions uniquely pertinent to the particular trial  These questions are to familiarize the judge and attorneys with the jurors and glean biases  experiences  or relationships that could jeopardize the proper course of the trial  After each prospective juror has answered the general slate of questions the attorneys may ask followup questions of some or all prospective jurors  Each side in the trial is allotted a certain number of challenges to remove prospective jurors from consideration  Some challenges are issued during voir dire while others are presented to the judge at the end of voir dire  The judge calls out the names of the anonymously challenged prospective jurors and those return to the pool for consideration in other trials  A jury is formed  then  of the remaining prospective jurors in the order that their names were originally chosen  Any prospective jurors not thusly impaneled return to the jury pool room   edit  Jury behavior Scholarly research on jury behavior in American non capital criminal felony trials reveals that juror outcomes appear to track the opinions of the median juror  rather than the opinions of the extreme juror on the panel  although juries were required to render unanimous verdicts in the jurisdictions studied  49  Thus  although juries must render unanimous verdicts  in run of the mill criminal trials they behave in practice as if they were operating using a majority rules voting system   edit  Jury effectiveness As much of the research on social conformity suggests  individuals tend to lose their sense of individuality when faced with powerful group forces  i e   normative influence  informational influence  interpersonal influence   50  This seemingly stark realization raises the question  Is the effectiveness of jury decision making compromised by individuals  tendencies to conform to the normative transmissions of a group  Since a clear archetype for determining guilt does not exist  the criminal justice system must rely on rulings handed down by juries  Even after a decision has been made  it is virtually impossible to know whether a jury has been correct or incorrect in freeing or accusing a defendant of a crime  Although establishing the effectiveness of juries is an arduous task  contemporary research has provided partial support for the proficiency of juries as decision makers  50   edit  The role of a Juror Evidence has shown that jurors typically take their roles very seriously  51  According to Simon  1980   jurors approach their responsibilities as decision makers much in the same way as a court judge   with great seriousness  a lawful mind  and a concern for consistency that is evidence based  By actively processing evidence  making inferences  using common sense and personal experiences to inform their decision making  research has indicated that jurors are effective decision makers that seek thorough understanding  rather than passive  apathetic participants unfit to serve on a jury  52   edit  Judge jury agreement Evidence supporting jury effectiveness has also been illustrated in studies that investigate the parallels between judge and jury decision making  53  According to Kalven and Zeisel  1966   it is not uncommon to find that the verdicts passed down by juries following a trial match the verdicts held by the appointed judges  Upon surveying judges and jurors of approximately 8000 criminal and civil trials  it was discovered that the verdicts handed down by both parties were in agreement 80  of the time  53  Such unpremeditated judge jury agreement supports the notion that juries are effective decision making bodies   edit  Buffering effects Jurors  like most individuals  are not free from holding social and cognitive biases  Oftentimes people negatively judge individuals who do not adhere to established social norms  e g   individuals who dress  freakishly   or do not meet societal standards of success  Although these biases tend to influence jurors  individual decisions during a trial  54  while working as part of a group  i e   jury   these biases are typically controlled  55  Groups tend to exert buffering effects that allow jurors to disregard their initial personal biases when forming a credible group decision   edit  Notes Wikiquote has a collection of quotations related to  Jury   W L  Warren   Henry II  University of California Press
