Military history of the United States during World War II From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search American B 17 Flying Fortresses in flight over Europe Key American military officials in Europe  1945 See also  United States Navy in World War II  and Air warfare of World War II The military history of the United States during World War II covers the World War II against Japan  Germany and Italy starting with the 7 December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor  Until that time  the United States had maintained formal neutrality  while supplying Britain  the Soviet Union and China with war material through Lend Lease  During the war over 16 million Americans served in the United States military  with 290 000 killed in action and 670 000 wounded  1  Key civilian advisors to President Franklin D  Roosevelt included Secretary of War Henry Stimson  who mobilized the nation s industries and induction centers to supply the Army  commanded by Gen  George C  Marshall and the Air Force under Gen  Hap Arnold  The Navy  led by Admiral Ernest King  proved more autonomous  Overall priorities were set by Roosevelt and the Joint Chiefs  chaired by William D  Leahy  Highest priority went to the defeat of Germany in Europe  but first the war against Japan in the Pacific was more urgent after the sinking of the main battleship fleet at Pearl Harbor  Adm  King put Adm  Chester W  Nimitz  based in Hawaii  in charge of the Central Pacific war against Japan  The result was a series of some of the most famous naval battles in history  The Imperial Japanese Navy had the advantage  taking the Philippines as well as British and Dutch possessions and threatening Australia  In June 1942  its main carriers were sunk at Midway  and the Americans seized the initiative  The Pacific war became one of island hopping  so as to move air bases closer and closer to Japan  The Army  based in Australia under Gen  Douglas MacArthur  steadily advanced across New Guinea to the Philippines  with plans to invade the home islands in late 1945  With its merchant fleet sunk by American submarines  Japan ran short of aviation gasoline and fuel oil  as the U S  Navy in June 1944 captured islands within bombing range of Tokyo  Strategic bombing directed by Gen  Curtis Lemay destroyed all the major cities  as the U S  captured Okinawa after heavy losses in spring 1945  With conventional and atomic bombs falling  an invasion imminent  and an unexpected Russian attack in August  Japan surrendered  The war against Germany involved collaboration with Britain and the Soviet Union  with the U S  supplying munitions until it could ready an invasion army  Working closely with Britain  the U S  invaded North Africa and Italy in 1942 43  but then bogged down after Italy surrendered and the Germans took over Italy  Finally the main invasion of France took place in June 1944  under Gen  Dwight D  Eisenhower  Meanwhile the Air Force systematically targeted German transportation links and synthetic oil plants  as it knocked out the Luftwaffe in 1944  With the Soviets unstoppable in the east  and the Allies unstoppable in the west  Germany was squeezed to death  Berlin fell to the Soviets in May 1945  and with Hitler dead the Germans surrendered  The military effort was strongly supported by civilians on the home front  who provided the soldiers  the munitions  the money and the morale to fight the war to victory  Contents 1 Origins 1 1 Command system 2 Lend Lease 3 Pacific Theater 3 1 The Battle of Pearl Harbor 3 2 Fall of the Philippines and

opinion was even more hostile to Japan  and there was little opposition to increased support for China  By 1940 the U S   while still neutral  was becoming the  Arsenal of Democracy  for the Allies  supplying money and war materials  The sudden defeat of France in spring 1940 caused the nation to begin to greatly grow its armed forces  including the first peacetime draft  After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941  America began sending Lend Lease aid to Russia as well as Britain and China  2   edit  Command system In 1942 President Franklin D  Roosevelt set up a new command structure with Admiral Ernest J  King as Chief of Naval Operations in complete control of the Navy and Marines  General George C  Marshall in charge of the Army  and in nominal control of the Air Force  which in practice was commanded by General Hap Arnold  Roosevelt formed a new body  the Joint Chiefs of Staff  which made the final decisions on American military strategy  The Joint Chiefs was a White House agency chaired by Admiral William D  Leahy  who became FDR s chief military advisor  3  As the war progressed Marshall became the dominant voice in the JCS in the shaping of strategy  4  When dealing with Europe  the Joint Chiefs met with their British counterparts and formed the Combined Chiefs of Staff  5  Unlike the political leaders of the other major powers  Roosevelt rarely overrode his military advisors  6  The civilians handled the draft and procurement of men and equipment  but no civilians not even the secretaries of War or Navy  had a voice in strategy  7  Roosevelt avoided the State Department and conducted high level diplomacy through his aides  especially Harry Hopkins  Since Hopkins also controlled  50 billion in Lend Lease funds given to the Allies  they paid attention to him   edit  Lend Lease Main articles  Lend Lease and First American shots fired in World War II   Without American production the United Nations could never have won the war      Joseph Stalin during a dinner at the Tehran Conference  1943 8  The year 1940 marked a change in attitude in the United States  The German victories in France  Poland and elsewhere  combined with the Battle of Britain  led many Americans to believe that the United States would be forced to fight soon  In March 1941  the Lend Lease program began shipping money  munitions  and food to Britain  China  and  by that fall  Russia  By 1941 the United States was taking an active part in the war  despite its nominal neutrality  In spring U boats began their  wolf pack  tactics which threatened to sever the trans  Atlantic supply line  Roosevelt extended the Pan American Security Zone east almost as far as Iceland  American warships escorting Allied convoys in the western Atlantic had several hostile encounters with U boats  On September 4  a German U Boat attacked the destroyer USS Greer off Iceland  A week later Roosevelt ordered American warships to shoot U boats on sight  A U boat shot up the USS Kearny as it escorted a British merchant convoy  The USS Reuben James was sunk by U 552 on October 31  1941  9   edit  Pacific Theater Main article  Pacific War See also  Pacific Theater of Operations  edit  The Battle of Pearl Harbor Explosion of the battleship USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor  Main article  Attack on Pearl Harbor Because of Japanese advances in French Indochina and China  the United States  in coordination with the British and Dutch  cut off all oil supplies to Japan  which had imported 90  of its oil  The oil embargo threatened to grind the Japanese military machine to a halt  Japan refused American demands to leave China and decided that war with the United States was inevitable  its only hope was to strike first  President Roosevelt had months earlier transferred the American fleet to Hawaii from California in order to deter the Japanese  The Battle of Pearl Harbor on December 7  1941 was the worst naval defeat in American history  The fight was completely one sided  Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto argued the only way to win the war was to knock out the main American fleet immediately  His elaborately trained fleet approached within 200 miles of Hawaii without being detected  Admiral Ch ichi Nagumo held tactical command  Over a five hour period his six carriers sent two waves of 360 dive bombers  torpedo planes and fighters  They destroyed or severely damaged eight battleships  ten smaller warships  and 230 aircraft  2 400 American soldiers and sailors were killed  Japanese losses were negligible 29 planes shot down  several American planes were also shot down by anti aircraft fire   Commander Minoru Genda  the chief planner of the raid  begged Nagumo to strike again at the shore facilities  oil storage tanks  and submarines  and to hunt down the American carriers that were supposedly nearby  But Nagumo  having just smashed the Americans in one of the greatest victories of naval history  decided not to risk further action  Japanese success was due to courage  good equipment  excellent pilots  total surprise  and above all  a daring and imaginative plan  To even reach Pearl Harbor they had to learn how to refuel at sea  a technique the US Navy already had worked out   to sink all those ships they used their superb electric torpedoes and perfected shallow water bombing tactics  Surprise was decisive  While everyone knew that war was imminent  no one at Pearl expected an attack  Despite later rumors  thee was no advance knowledge of the Japanese plan  The commanders had been complacent about routine defensive measures  Even if the defense had been more alert  the surprise and overwhelming power of the Japanese strike probably would have been decisive  In broader perspective  the attack was a failure  The lost battleships reflected obsolete doctrine and were not needed  the lost planes were soon replaced  the casualty list was short by World War II standards  Tokyo s calculation that the Americans would lose heart and seek a compromise peace proved wildly wrong the  sneak attack  electrified public opinion  committing America with near unanimity to a war to the death against the Japanese Empire  10  11  Following the attack on Pearl Harbor  President Roosevelt officially asked for a declaration of war on Japan before a joint session of Congress on 8 December 1941  The motion passed with only one vote against it  in both chambers   edit  Fall of the Philippines and Dutch East Indies Main article  Battle of the Philippines  1941 42  Within hours of Pearl harbor Japanese air forces from Formosa destroyed much of the U S  Far East Air Force  based near Manila  The Japanese army invaded and trapped the American and Filipino forces on the Bataan peninsula  Roosevelt evacuated General Douglas MacArthur and the nurses  but there was no way to save the trapped men against overwhelming Japanese naval power  MacArthur flew to Australia  vowing  I came out of Bataan and I shall return   Major General Jonathan M  Wainwright surrendered on 8 May  the prisoners died by the thousands in the Bataan Death March and in disease ridden Japanese prison camps where food and medicine were in very short supply  12  The Japanese Navy seemed unstoppable as they seized the Dutch East Indies to gain its rich oil resources  The American  British  Dutch  and Australian forces were combined under the ABDA command but its fleet was quickly sunk in several naval battles around Java   edit  Solomon Islands and New Guinea Campaign Main article  Solomon Islands Campaign Following their rapid advance  the Japanese started the Solomon Islands Campaign from their newly conquested main base at Rabaul in January 1942  The Japanese seized several islands including Tulagi and Guadalcanal  before they were halted by further events leading to the Guadalcanal Campaign  This campaign also converged with the New Guinea campaign   edit  Battle of the Coral Sea Main article  Battle of the Coral Sea See also  Coral Sea order of battle In May 1942  the United States fleet engaged the Japanese fleet during the first battle in history in which neither fleet fired directly on the other  nor did the ships of both fleets actually see each other  It was also the first time that aircraft carriers were used in battle  While indecisive  it was nevertheless a turning point because American commanders learned the tactics that would serve them later in the war   edit  Battle of the Aleutian Islands Main article  Battle of the Aleutian Islands The Battle of the Aleutian Islands was the last battle between sovereign nations to be fought on American soil  As part of a diversionary plan for the Battle of Midway  the Japanese took control of two of the Aleutian Islands  Their hope was that strong American naval forces would be drawn away from Midway  enabling a Japanese victory  Because their ciphers were broken  the American forces only drove the Japanese out after Midway   edit  Battle of Midway Main article  Battle of Midway See also  Midway order of battle The Japanese carrier Hiryu under attack during the battle of Midway Having learned important lessons at Coral Sea  the United States Navy was prepared when the Japanese navy under Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto launched an offensive aimed at destroying the American Pacific Fleet at Midway Island  The Japanese hoped to embarrass the Americans after the humiliation of the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo  Midway was a strategic island that both sides wished to use as an air base  Yamamoto hoped to achieve complete surprise and a quick capture of the island  followed by a decisive carrier battle with which he could completely destroy the American carrier fleet  Before the battle began  however  American intelligence intercepted his plan  allowing Admiral Chester Nimitz to formulate an effective defensive ambush of the Japanese fleet  13  The battle began on 4 June 1942  By the time it was over  the Japanese had lost four carriers  as opposed to one American carrier lost  The Battle of Midway was the turning point of the war in the Pacific because the United States had seized the initiative and was on the offensive for the duration of the war   edit  Island hopping Following the resounding victory at Midway  the United States began a major land offensive  The Allies came up with a strategy known as Island hopping  or the bypassing of islands that served little or no strategic importance  14  Because air power was crucial to any operation  only islands that could support airstrips were targeted by the Allies  The fighting for each island in the Pacific Theater would be savage  as the Americans faced a determined and battle hardened enemy who had known little defeat on the ground   edit  Air strategy General George Kenney  in charge of tactical air power under MacArthur  never had enough planes  pilots or supplies  15   He was not allowed any authority whatever over the Navy s carriers   But the Japanese were always in worse shape their equipment deteriorated rapidly because of poor airfields and incompetent maintenance  The Japanese had excellent planes and pilots in 1942  but ground commanders dictated their missions and ignored the need for air superiority before any other mission could be attempted  Theoretically  Japanese doctrine stressed the need to gain air superiority  but the infantry commanders repeatedly wasted air assets defending minor positions  When Arnold  echoing the official Army line  stated the Pacific was a  defensive  theater  Kenney retorted that the Japanese pilot was always on the offensive   He attacks all the time and persists in acting that way  To defend against him you not only have to attack him but to beat him to the punch   16  P 38 Lightning Key to Kenney s strategy was the neutralization of bypassed Japanese strongpoints like Rabaul and Truk through repeated bombings  He said a major shortfall was  the kids coming here from the States were green as grass  They were not getting enough gunnery  acrobatics  formation flying  or night flying   17  So he set up extensive retraining programs  The arrival of superior fighters  especially the twin tailed Lockheed P 38 Lightning  gave the Americans an edge in range and performance  Occasionally a ripe target appeared  as in the Battle of the Bismark Sea  March 1943  when bombers sank a major convoy bringing troops and supplies to New Guinea  That success was no fluke  High flying bombers almost never could hit moving ships  Kenney solved that weakness by teaching pilots the effective new tactic of flying in close to the water then pulling up and lobbing bombs that skipped across the water and into the target  18   edit  Building airfields The goal of island hopping was to build forward air fields  AAF commander General Hap Arnold correctly anticipated that he would have to build forward airfields in inhospitable places  Working closely with the Army Corps of Engineers  he created Aviation Engineer Battalions that by 1945 included 118 000 men  it operated in all theatres  Runways  hangars  radar stations  power generators  barracks  gasoline storage tanks and ordnance dumps had to be built hurriedly on tiny coral islands  mud flats  featureless deserts  dense jungles  or exposed locations still under enemy artillery fire  The heavy construction gear had to be imported  along with the engineers  blueprints  steel mesh landing mats  prefabricated hangars  aviation fuel  bombs and ammunition  and all necessary supplies  As soon as one project was finished the battalion would load up its gear and move forward to the next challenge  while headquarters inked in a new airfield on the maps  Heavy rains often reduced the capacity of old airfields  so new ones were built  Often engineers had to repair and use a captured enemy airfield  Unlike the well built German air fields in Europe  the Japanese installations were ramshackle affairs with poor siting  poor drainage  scant protection  and narrow  bumpy runways  Engineering was a low priority for the offense minded Japanese  who chronically lacked adequate equipment and imagination  19   edit  Combat experience Airmen flew far more often in the Southwest Pacific than in Europe  and although rest time in Australia was scheduled  there was no fixed number of missions that would produce transfer out of combat  as was the case in Europe  coupled with the monotonous  hot  sickly environment  the result was bad morale that jaded veterans quickly passed along to newcomers  After a few months  epidemics of combat fatigue  now called Combat stress reaction  would drastically reduce the efficiency of units  The men who had been at jungle airfields longest  the flight surgeons reported  were in bad shape  Many have chronic dysentery or other disease  and almost all show chronic fatigue states       They appear listless  unkempt  careless  and apathetic with almost masklike facial expression  Speech is slow  thought content is poor  they complain of chronic headaches  insomnia  memory defect  feel forgotten  worry about themselves  are afraid of new assignments  have no sense of responsibility  and are hopeless about the future   20   edit  Marine Aviation and the issue of ground support Chance Vought F4U Corsair The Marines had their own land based aviation  built around the excellent Chance Vought F4U Corsair  an unusually large fighter bomber  By 1944 10 000 Marine pilots operated 126 combat squadrons  Marine Aviation originally had the mission of close support for ground troops  but it dropped that role in the 1920s and 1930s and became a junior component of naval aviation  The new mission was to protect the fleet from enemy air attacks  Marine pilots  like all aviators  fiercely believed in the prime importance of air superiority  they did not wish to be tied down to supporting ground troops  On the other hand  the ground Marines needed close air support because they lacked heavy firepower of their own  Mobility was a basic mission of Marine ground forces  they were too lightly armed to employ the sort of heavy artillery barrages and massed tank movements the Army used to clear the battlefield  The Japanese were so well dug in that Marines often needed air strikes on positions 300 to 1 500 yards ahead  In 1944  after considerable internal acrimony  Marine Aviation was forced to start helping out  At Iwo Jima ex pilots in the air liaison party  ALP  not only requested air support  but actually directed it in tactical detail  The Marine formula increased responsiveness  reduced  friendly  casualties  and  flying weather permitting  substituted well for the missing armor and artillery  For the next half century close air support would remain central to the mission of Marine Aviation  provoking eternal jealousy from the Army which was never allowed to operate fixed wing fighters or bombers  although the Army was allowed to have some unarmed transports and spotter planes  21   edit  Guadalcanal Main article  Battle of Guadalcanal See also  Battle of Guadalcanal order of battle Guadalcanal  fought from August 1942 to February 1943  was the first major Allied offensive of the war in the Pacific Theater  This campaign pitted American air  naval and ground forces  later augmented by Australians and New Zealanders  against determined Japanese resistance  Guadalcanal was the key to control the Solomon Islands  which both sides as strategically essential  Both sides won some battles but both sides were overextended in terms of supply lines  Logistical failures in a hostile physical environment hampered everyone  As happened time and again in the Pacific  the Japanese logistical support system failed  as only 20  of the supplies dispatched from Rabaul to Guadalcanal ever reached there  Consequently the 30 000 Japanese troops lacked heavy equipment  adequate ammunition and even enough food  10 000 were killed  10 000 starved to death  and the remaining 10 000 were evacuated in February 1943  In the end Guadalcanal was a major American victory as the Japanese inability to keep pace with the rate of American reinforcements proved decisive  Guadalcanal is an iconic episode in the annals of American military history  underscoring heroic bravery of underequipped individuals in fierce combat with a determined foe  22  Marines from the 1st Marine Division and soldiers from the Army XIV Corps landed on 7 August 1942  They quickly captured Henderson Field  and prepared defenses  In the Battle of Bloody Ridge  the Americans held off wave after wave of Japanese counterattacks before charging what was left of the Japanese  After more than six months of combat the island was firmly in control of the Allies on 8 February 1943  Meanwhile the rival navies fought seven battles  with the two sides diving the victories  23  They were  Battle of Savo Island  Battle of the Eastern Solomons  Battle of Cape Esperance  Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands  Naval Battle of Guadalcanal  Battle of Tassafaronga and Battle of Rennell Island   edit  Tarawa Main article  Battle of Tarawa An M4 Sherman tank equipped with a flamethrower clearing a Japanese bunker  Guadalcanal made it clear to the Americans that the Japanese would fight to the bitter end  After brutal fighting in which few prisoners were taken on either side  the United States and the Allies pressed on the offensive  The landings at Tarawa on 20 November 1943  by the Americans became bogged down as armor attempting to break through the Japanese lines of defense either sank  were disabled or took on too much water to be of use  The Americans were eventually able to land a limited number of tanks and drive inland  After days of fighting the Allies took control of Tarawa on 23 November  Of the original 2 600 Japanese soldiers on the island  only 17 were still alive   edit  Operations in Central Pacific In preparation of the recapture of the Philippines  the Allies started the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign to retake the Gilbert and Marshall Islands from the Japanese in summer 1943  Moving closer to Japan  the U S  Navy decisively won the Battle of the Philippine Sea and landing forces captured the Mariana and Palau Islands in summer 1944  The goal was building airbases within range of the new B 29 bomber aimed at Japan s industrial cities   edit  Liberation of the Philippines Main articles  Battle of Leyte Gulf and Philippines Campaign  1944 45  Admiral William F   Bull  Halsey   Commander U S  Third Fleet at Leyte Gulf The Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 23 26  1944  was a decisive American victory that sank virtually the entire remaining Japanese fleet in the largest naval battle in history  Although the Japanese came surprisingly close to inflicting a major defeat on the Americans  at the last minute the Japanese panicked and lost  The battle was a complex overlapping series of engagements fought off the Philippine island of Leyte  which the U S  Army had just invaded  The army forces were highly vulnerable to naval attack  and the Japanese goal was to inflict massive destruction  Two American fleets were involved  the Seventh and Third  but they were independent and did not communicate well so the Japanese with a trick maneuver slipped between the two American fleets and almost reached the beaches  However the Japanese communication system was even worse  and the Japanese army and navy did not cooperate  and the three Japanese fleets were each destroyed  24  General MacArthur fulfilled his promise to return to the Philippines by landing at Leyte on 20 October 1944  The grueling re capture of the Philippines took place from 1944 to 1945 and included the battles of Leyte  Luzon  and Mindanao   edit  Iwo Jima Main article  Battle of Iwo Jima The Americans did not bypass the small island of Iwo Jima because it wanted bases for fighter escorts  it was actually used as an emergency landing base for B 29s  The Japanese knew they could not win  but the devised a strategy to maximize American casualties  Learning from the Battle of Saipan they prepared many fortified positions on the island  including pillboxes and underground tunnels  The Marines attack began on 19 February 1945  Initially the Japanese put up no resistance  letting the Americans mass  creating more targets before the Americans took intense fire from Mount Suribachi and fought throughout the night until the hill was surrounded  Even as the Japanese were pressed into an ever shrinking pocket  they chose to fight to the end  leaving only 1 000 of the original 21 000 alive  The Marines suffered as well  losing 7 000 men  The battle became iconic in America as the epitome of heroism in desperate hand to hand combat  25   edit  Okinawa Main article  Battle of Okinawa Okinawa became the last major battle of the Pacific Theater and the Second World War  The island was to become a staging area for the eventual invasion of Japan since it was just 350 miles  550 km  south of the Japanese mainland  Marines and soldiers landed unopposed on 1 April 1945  to begin an 82 day campaign which became the largest land sea air battle in history and was noted for the ferocity of the fighting and the high civilian casualties with over 150 000 Okinawans losing their lives  Japanese kamikaze pilots caused the largest loss of ships in U S  naval history with the sinking of 38 and the damaging of another 368  Total U S  casualties were over 12 500 dead and 38 000 wounded  while the Japanese lost over 110 000 men  The fierce combat and high American losses led the Navy to oppose an invasion of the main islands  An alternative strategy was chosen  using the atomic bomb to induce surrender  26   edit  Strategic Bombing of Japan Main article  Air raids on Japan The flammability of Japan s large cities  and the concentration of munitions production there  made strategic bombing the favorite strategy of the Americans from 1941 onward  The first efforts were made from bases in China  where massive efforts to establish B 29 bases there and supply them over the Hump  the Himalayas  failed in 1944 the Japanese Army simply moved overland and captured the bases  Saipan and Tinian   captured by the U S  in June 1944  gave secure bases for the very long range B 29  The Boeing B 29 Superfortress boasted four 2 200 horsepower Wright R 3350 supercharged engines that could lift four tons of bombs 33 000 feet  high above Japanese flak or fighters   and make 3 500 mile round trips  However  the systematic raids that began in June 1944  were unsatisfactory  because the AAF had learned too much in Europe  it overemphasized self defense  Arnold  in personal charge of the campaign  bypassing the theater commanders  brought in a new leader  brilliant  indefatigable  hard charging General Curtis LeMay  In early 1945  LeMay ordered a radical change in tactics  remove the machine guns and gunners  fly in low at night   Much fuel was used to get to 30 000 feet  it could now be replaced with more bombs   The Japanese radar  fighter  and anti aircraft systems were so ineffective that they could not hit the bombers  Fires raged through the cities  and millions of civilians fled to the mountains  27  Tokyo was hit repeatedly  and suffered a fire storm in March that killed 83 000  On June 5  51 000 buildings in four miles of Kobe were burned out by 473 B 29s  the Japanese were learning to fight back  as 11 B 29s went down and 176 were damaged  28  Osaka  where one sixth of the Empire s munitions were made  was hit by 1 733 tons of incendiaries dropped by 247 B 29s  A firestorm burned out 8 1 square miles  including 135 000 houses  4 000 died  29  30  The Japanese local officials reported  Although damage to big factories was slight  approximately one fourth of some 4 000 lesser factories  which operated hand in hand with the big factories  were completely destroyed by fire     Moreover  owing to the rising fear of air attacks  workers in general were reluctant to work in the factories  and the attendance fluctuated as much as 50 percent  The Japanese army  which was not based in the cities  was largely undamaged by the raids  The Army was short of food and gasoline  but  as Iwo Jima and Okinawa proved  it was capable of ferocious resistance  The Japanese also had a new tactic that it hoped would provide the bargaining power to get a satisfactory peace  the Kamikaze   edit  Kamikaze In late 1944 the Japanese invented an unexpected and highly effective new tactic  the Kamikaze suicide plane aimed like a guided missile at American ships  The attacks began in October 1944 and continued to the end of the war  Experienced pilots were used to lead a mission because they could navigate  they were not Kamikazes  and they returned to base for another mission  The Kamikaze pilots were inexperienced and had minimal training  however most were well educated and intensely committed to the Emperor  31  32  A  Judy  in a suicide dive against USS Essex  The dive brakes are extended and the port wing tank is trailing fuel vapor and smoke November 25  1944  Kamikaze attacks were highly effective at the Battle of Okinawa as 4000 kamikaze sorties sank 38 US ships and damaged 368 more  killing 4 900 sailors  33  Task Force 58 analyzed the Japanese technique at Okinawa in April 1945   Rarely have the enemy attacks been so cleverly executed and made with such reckless determination  These attacks were generally by single or few aircraft making their approaches with radical changes in course and altitude  dispersing when intercepted and using cloud cover to every advantage  They tailed our friendlies home  used decoy planes  and came in at any altitude or on the water   34  The Americans decided best defense against Kamikazes was to knock them out on the ground  or else in the air long before they approached the fleet  The Navy called for more fighters  and more warning  which meant combat air patrols circling the big ships  more radar picket ships  which themselves became prime targets   and more attacks on airbases and gasoline supplies  Japan suspended Kamikaze attacks in May 1945  because it was now hoarding gasoline and hiding planes in preparation for new suicide attacks if the Allies dared to invade their home islands  The Kamikaze strategy allowed the use of untrained pilots and obsolete planes  and since evasive maneuvering was dropped and there was no return trip  the scarce gasoline reserves could be stretched further  Since pilots guided their airplane like a guided missile all the way to the target  the proportion of hits was much higher than in ordinary bombing  Japan s industry was manufacturing 1 500 new planes a month in 1945  However  the quality of construction was very poor  and many new planes crashed during training or before reaching targets  Expecting increased resistance  including far more Kamikaze attacks once the main islands of Japan were invaded  the U S  high command rethought its strategy and used atomic bombs to end the war  hoping it would make a costly invasion unnecessary  35   edit  Hiroshima and Nagasaki Main article  Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki See also  Operation Downfall As victory for the United States slowly approached  casualties mounted  A fear in the American high command was that an invasion of mainland Japan would lead to enormous losses on the part of the Allies  as casualty estimates for the planned Operation Downfall demonstrate  President Harry Truman gave the order to drop the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima on 6 August 1945  hoping that the destruction of the city would break Japanese resolve and end the war  A second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki on 9 August  after it appeared that the Japanese high command was not planning to surrender  Approximately 140 000 people died in Hiroshima from the bomb and its aftereffects by the end of 1945  and approximately 74 000 in Nagasaki  in both cases mostly civilians  15 August 1945  or V J Day  marked the end of the United States  war with the Empire of Japan  Since Japan was the last remaining Axis Power  V J Day also marked the end of World War II   edit  Minor American front Main article  China Burma India Theater of World War II The United States contributed several forces to the China Burma India theater  such as a volunteer air squadron  later incorporated into the Army Air Force   and Merrill s

commanded the assault on North Africa  and Major General George Patton struck at Casablanca   edit  Allied victory in North Africa Main article  North African Campaign The United States did not have a smooth entry into the war against Nazi Germany  Early in 1943  the U S  Army suffered a near disastrous defeat at the Battle of the Kasserine Pass in February  The senior Allied leadership was primarily to blame for the loss as internal bickering between American General Lloyd Fredendall and the British led to mistrust and little communication  causing inadequate troop placements  37  The defeat could be considered a major turning point  however  because General Eisenhower replaced Fredendall with General Patton  Slowly the Allies stopped the German advance in Tunisia and by March were pushing back  In mid April  under British General Bernard Montgomery  the Allies smashed through the Mareth Line and broke the Axis defense in North Africa  On 13 May 1943  Axis troops in North Africa surrendered  leaving behind 275 000 men  Allied efforts turned towards Sicily and Italy   edit  Invasion of Sicily and Italy Main articles  Allied invasion of Sicily and Allied invasion of Italy The first stepping stone for the Allied liberation of Europe was  in Prime Minister Winston Churchill s words  the  soft underbelly  of Europe on the Italian island of Sicily  Launched on 9 July 1943  Operation Husky was  at the time  the largest amphibious operation ever undertaken  The operation was a success  and on 17 August the Allies were in control of the island  Following the Allied victory in Sicily  Italian public sentiment swung against the war and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini  He was deposed in a coup  and the Allies struck quickly  hoping resistance would be slight  The first American troops landed on the Italian peninsula in September 1943  and Italy surrendered on 8 September  German troops in Italy were prepared  however  and took up the defensive positions  As winter approached  the Allies made slow progress against the heavily defended German Winter Line  until the victory at Monte Cassino  Rome fell to the Allies on 4 June 1944   edit  Strategic bombing B 17s in flight General Eisenhower speaks with members of the 101st Airborne Division on the evening of 5 June 1944 American troops approaching Omaha Beach Reinforcements of men and equipment moving inland from Omaha Main articles  Strategic bombing during World War II and Air warfare of World War II Numerous bombing runs were launched by the United States aimed at the industrial heart of Germany  Using the high altitude B 17  it was necessary for the raids to be conducted in daylight for the drops to be accurate  As adequate fighter escort was rarely available  the bombers would fly in tight  box formations  allowing each bomber to provide overlapping machine gun fire for defense  The tight formations made it impossible to evade fire from Luftwaffe fighters  however  and American bomber crew losses were high  One such example was the Schweinfurt Regensburg mission  which resulted in staggering losses of men and equipment  The introduction of the revered P 51 Mustang  which had enough fuel to make a round trip to Germany s heartland  helped to reduce losses later in the war   edit  Operation Overlord Main article  Operation Overlord The second European front that the Soviets had pressed for was finally opened on 6 June 1944  when the Allies attacked the heavily fortified Atlantic Wall  Supreme Allied commander General Dwight D  Eisenhower had delayed the attack because of bad weather  but finally the largest amphibious assault in history began  After prolonged bombing runs on the French coast by the U S  Army Air Force  225 U S  Army Rangers scaled the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc under intense enemy fire and destroyed the German gun emplacements that could have threatened the amphibious landings  Also prior to the main amphibious assault  the American 82nd and 101st Airborne divisions dropped behind the beaches into Nazi occupied France  in an effort to protect the coming landings  Many of the paratroopers had not been dropped on their intended landing zones and were scattered throughout Normandy  As the paratroops fought their way through the hedgerows  the main amphibious landings began  The Americans came ashore at the beaches codenamed  Omaha  and  Utah   The landing craft bound for Utah  as with so many other units  went off course  coming ashore two kilometers off target  The 4th Infantry Division faced weak resistance during the landings and by the afternoon were linked up with paratroopers fighting their way towards the coast  However  at Omaha the Germans had prepared the beaches with land mines  Czech hedgehogs and Belgian Gates in anticipation of the invasion  Intelligence prior to the landings had placed the less experienced German 714th Division in charge of the defense of the beach  However  the highly trained and experienced 352nd moved in days before the invasion  As a result  the soldiers from the 1st and 29th Infantry Divisions became pinned down by superior enemy fire immediately after leaving their landing craft  In some instances  entire landing craft full of men were mowed down by the well positioned German defenses  As the casualties mounted  the soldiers formed impromptu units and advanced inland  The small units then fought their way through the minefields that were in between the Nazi machine gun bunkers  After squeezing through  they then attacked the bunkers from the rear  allowing more men to come safely ashore  By the end of the day  the Americans suffered over 6 000 casualties   edit  Operation Cobra Main article  Operation Cobra After the amphibious assault  the Allied forces remained stalled in Normandy for some time  advancing much more slowly than expected with close fought infantry battles in the dense hedgerows  However  with Operation Cobra  launched on 24 July with mostly American troops  the Allies succeeded in breaking the German lines and sweeping out into France with fast moving armored divisions  This led to a major defeat for the Germans  with 400 000 soldiers trapped in the Falaise pocket  and the capture of Paris on 25 August   edit  Operation Market Garden Main article  Operation Market Garden See also  Operation Market Garden order of battle Paratroopers landing in Holland  The next major Allied operation came on 17 September  Devised by British General Bernard Montgomery  its primary objective was the capture of several bridges in the Netherlands  Fresh off of their successes in Normandy  the Allies were optimistic that an attack on the Nazi occupied Netherlands would force open a route across the Rhine and onto the North German Plain  Such an opening would allow Allied forces to break out northward and advance toward Denmark and  ultimately  Berlin  The plan involved a daylight drop of the American 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions  The 101st was to capture the bridges at Eindhoven  with the 82nd taking the bridges at Grave and Nijmegen  After the bridges had been captured  the ground force  also known as XXX Corps or  Garden   would drive up a single road and link up with the paratroops  The operation failed because the Allies were unable to capture the bridge furthest to the north at Arnhem  There  the British 1st Airborne had been dropped to secure the bridges  but upon landing they discovered that a highly experienced German SS Panzer unit was garrisoning the town  The paratroopers were only lightly equipped in respect to anti tank weaponry and quickly lost ground  Failure to quickly relieve those members of the 1st who had managed to seize the bridge at Arnhem on the part of the balance of the 6th  as well as the armored XXX Corps  meant that the Germans were able to stymie the entire operation  In the end  the operation s ambitious nature  the fickle state of war  and failures on the part of Allied intelligence  as well as tenacious German defense  can be blamed for Market Garden s ultimate failure  This operation also signaled the last time that either the 82nd or 101st would make a combat jump during the war   edit  Battle of the Bulge Main articles  Battle of the Bulge  Battle of Bastogne  and Battle of Hurtgen Forest The  bulge  created by the German offensive  Unable to push north into the Netherlands  the Allies in western Europe were forced to consider other options to get into Germany  However  in December 1944  the Germans launched a massive attack westward in the Ardennes forest  hoping to punch a hole in the Allied lines and capture the Belgian city of Antwerp  The Allies responded slowly  allowing the German attack to create a large  bulge  in the Allied lines  In the initial stages of the offensive  American POW s from the 285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion were executed at the Malmedy massacre by Nazi SS and Fallschirmj ger  As the Germans pushed westward  General Eisenhower ordered the 101st Airborne and elements of the U S  10th Armored Division into the road junction town of Bastogne to prepare a defense  The town quickly became cut off and surrounded  The winter weather slowed Allied air support  and the defenders were outnumbered and low on supplies  When given a request for their surrender from the Germans  General Anthony McAuliffe  acting commander of the 101st  replied   Nuts    contributing to the stubborn American defense  38  On 19 December  General Patton told Eisenhower that he could have his army in Bastogne in 48 hours  Patton then turned his army  at the time on the front in Luxembourg  north to break through to Bastogne  Patton s armor pushed north  and by 26 December was in Bastogne  effectively ending the siege  By the time it was over  more American soldiers had served in the battle than in any engagement in American history  39   edit  Race to Berlin Following the defeat of the German army in the Ardennes  the Allies pushed back towards the Rhine and the heart of Germany  With the capture of the Ludendorff bridge at Remagen  the Allies crossed the Rhine in March 1945  The Americans then executed a pincer movement  setting up the Ninth Army north  and the First Army south  When the Allies closed the pincer  300 000 Germans were captured in the Ruhr Pocket  The Americans then turned east  meeting up with the Soviets at the Elbe River in April  The Germans surrendered Berlin to the Soviets on 2 May 1945  The war in Europe came to an official end on V E Day  8 May 1945   edit
