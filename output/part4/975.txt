cyborg  short for  cybernetic organism   is a being with both biological and artificial  e g  electronic  mechanical or robotic  parts  The term was coined in 1960 when Manfred Clynes and Nathan S  Kline used it in an article about the advantages of self regulating human machine systems in outer space  1  D  S  Halacy s Cyborg  Evolution of the Superman in 1965 featured an introduction which spoke of a  new frontier  that was  not merely space  but more profoundly the relationship between  inner space  to  outer space    a bridge   between mind and matter   2  The term cyborg is often applied to an organism that has enhanced abilities due to technology  3  though this perhaps oversimplifies the necessity of feedback for regulating the subsystem  The more strict definition of Cyborg is almost always considered as increasing or enhancing normal capabilities  While cyborgs are commonly thought of as mammals  they might also conceivably be any kind of organism and the term  Cybernetic organism  has been applied to networks  such as road systems  corporations and governments  which have been classed as such  The term can also apply to micro organisms which are modified to perform at higher levels than their unmodified counterparts  Fictional cyborgs are portrayed as a synthesis of organic and synthetic parts  and frequently pose the question of difference between human and machine as one concerned with morality  free will  and empathy  Fictional cyborgs may be represented as visibly mechanical  e g  the Cybermen in the Doctor Who franchise or The Borg from Star Trek   or as almost indistinguishable from humans  e g  the Terminators from the Terminator films  the  Human  Cylons from the re imagining of Battlestar Galactica etc   The 1970s television series The Six Million Dollar Man featured one of the most famous fictional cyborgs  referred to as a bionic man  Cyborgs in fiction often play up a human contempt for over dependence on technology  particularly when used for war  and when used in ways that seem to threaten free will  Cyborgs are also often portrayed with physical or mental abilities far exceeding a human counterpart  military forms may have inbuilt weapons  among other things   Contents 1 Overview 2 Origins 3 Individual cyborgs 4 Social cyborgs 5 Cyborg proliferation in society 5 1 In medicine 5 2 In the military 5 3 In art 5 4 Artists

some definitions of the term  the metaphysical and physical attachments humanity has with even the most basic technologies have already made them cyborgs  4  In a typical example  a human fitted with a heart pacemaker or an insulin pump  if the person has diabetes  might be considered a cyborg  since these mechanical parts enhance the body s  natural  mechanisms through synthetic feedback mechanisms  Some theorists cite such modifications as contact lenses  hearing aids  or intraocular lenses as examples of fitting humans with technology to enhance their biological capabilities  however  these modifications are as cybernetic as a pen or a wooden leg  Cochlear implants that combine mechanical modification with any kind of feedback response are more accurately cyborg enhancements  The term is also used to address human technology mixtures in the abstract  This includes artifacts that may not popularly be considered technology  for example  pen and paper  and speech and language  Augmented with these technologies  and connected in communication with people in other times and places  a person becomes capable of much more than they were before  This is like computers  which gain power by using Internet protocols to connect with other computers  Cybernetic technologies include highways  pipes  electrical wiring  buildings  electrical plants  libraries  and other infrastructure that we hardly notice  but which are critical parts of the cybernetics that we work within  Bruce Sterling in his universe of Shaper Mechanist suggested an idea of alternative cyborg called Lobster  which is made not by using internal implants  but by using an external shell  e g  a Powered Exoskeleton   5  Unlike human cyborgs that appear human externally while being synthetic internally  a Lobster looks inhuman externally but contains a human internally  The computer game Deus Ex  Invisible War prominently featured cyborgs called Omar  where  Omar  is a Russian translation of the word  Lobster   since the Omar are of Russian origin in the game    edit  Origins The concept of a man machine mixture was widespread in science fiction before World War II  As early as 1843  Edgar Allan Poe described a man with extensive prostheses in the short story  The Man That Was Used Up   In 1908  Jean de la Hire introduced Nyctalope  perhaps the first true superhero was also the first literary cyborg  in the novel L Homme Qui Peut Vivre Dans L eau  The Man Who Can Live in the Water   Edmond Hamilton presented space explorers with a mixture of organic and machine parts in his novel The Comet Doom in 1928  He later featured the talking  living brain of an old scientist  Simon Wright  floating around in a transparent case  in all the adventures of his famous hero  Captain Future  He uses the term explicitly in the 1962 short story   After a Judgment Day   to describe the  mechanical analogs  called  Charlies   explaining that   c yborgs  they had been called from the first one in the 1960 s   cybernetic organisms   In the short story  No Woman Born  in 1944  C  L  Moore wrote of Deirdre  a dancer  whose body was burned completely and whose brain was placed in a faceless but beautiful and supple mechanical body  The term was coined by Manfred E  Clynes and Nathan S  Kline in 1960 to refer to their conception of an enhanced human being who could survive in extraterrestrial environments  For the exogenously extended organizational complex functioning as an integrated homeostatic system unconsciously  we propose the term  Cyborg   Manfred E  Clynes and Nathan S  Kline 6  Their concept was the outcome of thinking about the need for an intimate relationship between human and machine as the new frontier of space exploration was beginning to take place  A designer of physiological instrumentation and electronic data processing systems  Clynes was the chief research scientist in the Dynamic Simulation Laboratory at Rockland State Hospital in New York  The term first appears in print five months earlier when The New York Times reported on the Psychophysiological Aspects of Space Flight Symposium where Clynes and Kline first presented their paper  A cyborg is essentially a man machine system in which the control mechanisms of the human portion are modified externally by drugs or regulatory devices so that the being can live in an environment different from the normal one  7  A book titled Cyborg  Digital Destiny and Human Possibility in the Age of the Wearable computer was published by Doubleday in 2001  Some of the ideas in the book were incorporated into the 35mm motion picture film Cyberman   edit  Individual cyborgs Jens Naumann  a man with acquired blindness  being interviewed about his vision BCI on CBS s The Early Show Neil Harbisson is sometimes claimed to be a cyborg  8  Generally  the term  cyborg  is used to refer to a human with bionic  or robotic  implants  In current prosthetic applications  the C Leg system developed by Otto Bock HealthCare is used to replace a human leg that has been amputated because of injury or illness  The use of sensors in the artificial C Leg aids in walking significantly by attempting to replicate the user s natural gait  as it would be prior to amputation  9  Prostheses like the C Leg and the more advanced iLimb are considered by some to be the first real steps towards the next generation of real world cyborg applications  Additionally cochlear implants and magnetic implants which provide people with a sense that they would not otherwise have had can additionally be thought of as creating cyborgs  In vision science  direct brain implants have been used to treat non congenital  acquired  blindness  One of the first scientists to come up with a working brain interface to restore sight was private researcher William Dobelle  Dobelle s first prototype was implanted into  Jerry   a man blinded in adulthood  in 1978  A single array BCI containing 68 electrodes was implanted onto Jerry s visual cortex and succeeded in producing phosphenes  the sensation of seeing light  The system included cameras mounted on glasses to send signals to the implant  Initially  the implant allowed Jerry to see shades of grey in a limited field of vision at a low frame rate  This also required him to be hooked up to a two ton mainframe  but shrinking electronics and faster computers made his artificial eye more portable and now enable him to perform simple tasks unassisted  10  In 2002  Canadian Jens Naumann  also blinded in adulthood  became the first in a series of 16 paying patients to receive Dobelle s second generation implant  marking one of the earliest commercial uses of BCIs  The second generation device used a more sophisticated implant enabling better mapping of phosphenes into coherent vision  Phosphenes are spread out across the visual field in what researchers call the starry night effect  Immediately after his implant  Jens was able to use his imperfectly restored vision to drive slowly around the parking area of the research institute  11  In 2002  under the heading Project Cyborg  a British scientist  Kevin Warwick  had an array of 100 electrodes fired in to his nervous system in order to link his nervous system into the Internet  With this in place he successfully carried out a series of experiments including extending his nervous system over the Internet to control a robotic hand  a loudspeaker and amplifier  This is a form of extended sensory input and the first direct electronic communication between the nervous systems of two humans  12  13  In 2004  under the heading Bridging the Island of the Colourblind Project  a British and completely color blind artist  Neil Harbisson  started wearing an eyeborg on his head in order to hear colors  14  His prosthetic device was included within his 2004 passport photograph which has been claimed to confirm his cyborg status  15   edit  Social cyborgs More broadly  the full term  cybernetic organism  is used to describe larger networks of communication and control  For example  cities  networks of roads  networks of software  corporations  markets  governments  and the collection of these things together  A corporation can be considered as an artificial intelligence that makes use of replaceable human components to function  People at all ranks can be considered replaceable agents of their functionally intelligent government institutions  whether such a view is desirable or not  The example above is reminiscent of the  organic paradigm  popular in the late 19th century due to the era s breakthroughs in understanding of cellular biology  Jaap van Till tries to quantify this effect with his Synthecracy Network Law  V   N    where V is value and N is number of connected people  This factorial growth is what he claims leads to a herd or hive like thinking between large  electronically connected groups   edit  Cyborg proliferation in society This section may contain original research  Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding references  Statements consisting only of original research may be removed  More details may be available on the talk page   November 2007   edit  In medicine In medicine  there are two important and different types of cyborgs  the restorative and the enhanced  Restorative technologies  restore lost function  organs  and limbs   16  The key aspect of restorative cyborgization is the repair of broken or missing processes to revert to a healthy or average level of function  There is no enhancement to the original faculties and processes that were lost  On the contrary  the enhanced cyborg  follows a principle  and it is the principle of optimal performance  maximising output  the information or modifications obtained  and minimising input  the energy expended in the process    17  Thus  the enhanced cyborg intends to exceed normal processes or even gain new functions that were not originally present  Although prostheses in general supplement lost or damaged body parts with the integration of a mechanical artifice  bionic implants in medicine allow model organs or body parts to mimic the original function more closely  Michael Chorost wrote a memoir of his experience with cochlear implants  or bionic ear  titled  Rebuilt  How Becoming Part Computer Made Me More Human   18 Jesse Sullivan became one of the first people to operate a fully robotic limb through a nerve muscle graft  enabling him a complex range of motions beyond that of previous prosthetics  19  By 2004  a fully functioning artificial heart was developed  20  The continued technological development of bionic and nanotechnologies begins to raise the question of enhancement  and of the future possibilities for cyborgs which surpass the original functionality of the biological model  The ethics and desirability of  enhancement prosthetics  have been debated  their proponents include the transhumanist movement  with its belief that new technologies can assist the human race in developing beyond its present  normative limitations such as aging and disease  as well as other  more general incapacities  such as limitations on speed  strength  endurance  and intelligence  Opponents of the concept describe what they believe to be biases which propel the development and acceptance of such technologies  namely  a bias towards functionality and efficiency that may compel assent to a view of human people which de emphasizes as defining characteristics actual manifestations of humanity and personhood  in favor of definition in terms of upgrades  versions  and utility  21  A brain computer interface  or BCI  provides a direct path of communication from the brain to an external device  effectively creating a cyborg  Research of Invasive BCIs  which utilize electrodes implanted directly into the grey matter of the brain  has focused on restoring damaged eyesight in the blind and providing functionality to paralyzed people  most notably those with severe cases  such as Locked In syndrome  This technology could enable people who are missing a limb or are in a wheelchair the power to control the devices that aide them through neural signals sent from the brain implants directly to computers or the devices  It is possible that this technology will also eventually be used with healthy people  22  Deep brain stimulation is a neurological surgical procedure used for therapeutic purposes  This process has aided in treating patients diagnosed with Parkinson s disease  Alzheimer s disease  Tourette syndrome  epilepsy  chronic headaches  and mental disorders  After the patient is unconscious  through anesthesia  brain pacemakers or electrodes  are implanted into the region of the brain where the cause of the disease is present  The region of the brain is then stimulated by bursts of electrical current to disrupt the oncoming surge of seizures  Like all invasive procedures  deep brain stimulation may put the patient at a higher risk  However  there has been more improvements in recent years with deep brain stimulation than any available drug treatment  23  Retinal implants are another form of cyborgization in medicine  The theory behind retinal stimulation to restore vision to people suffering from retinitis pigmentosa and vision loss due to aging  conditions in which people have an abnormally low amount of ganglion cells  is that the retinal implant and electrical stimulation would act as a substitute for the missing ganglion cells  cells which connect the eye to the brain   While work to perfect this technology is still being done  there have already been major advances in the use of electronic stimulation of the retina to allow the eye to sense patterns of light  A specialized camera is worn by the subject  such as on the frames of their glasses  which converts the image into a pattern of electrical stimulation  A chip located in the user s eye would then electrically stimulate the retina with this pattern by exciting certain nerve endings which transmit the image to the optic centers of the brain and the image would then appear to the user  If technological advances proceed as planned this technology may be used by thousands of blind people and restore vision to most of them  A similar process has been created to aide people who have lost their vocal cords  This experimental device would do away with previously used robotic sounding voice simulators  The transmission of sound would start with a surgery to redirect the nerve that controls the voice and sound production to a muscle in the neck  where a nearby sensor would be able to pick up its electrical signals  The signals would then move to a processor which would control the timing and pitch of a voice simulator  That simulator would then vibrate producing a multitonal sound which could be shaped into words by the mouth  24   edit  In the military Military organizations  research has recently focused on the utilisation of cyborg animals for the purposes of a supposed tactical advantage  DARPA has announced its interest in developing  cyborg insects  to transmit data from sensors implanted into the insect during the pupal stage  The insect s motion would be controlled from a Micro Electro Mechanical System  MEMS  and could conceivably survey an environment or detect explosives and gas  25  Similarly  DARPA is developing a neural implant to remotely control the movement of sharks  The shark s unique senses would then be exploited to provide data feedback in relation to enemy ship movement or underwater explosives  26  In 2006  researchers at Cornell University invented 27  a new surgical procedure to implant artificial structures into insects during their metamorphic development  28  29  The first insect cyborgs  moths with integrated electronics in their thorax  were demonstrated by the same researchers  30  31  The initial success of the techniques has resulted in increased research and the creation of a program called Hybrid Insect MEMS  HI MEMS  Its goal  according to DARPA s Microsystems Technology Office  is to develop  tightly coupled machine insect interfaces by placing micro mechanical systems inside the insects during the early stages of metamorphosis   32  In 2009 at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  IEEE  Micro electronic mechanical systems  MEMS  conference in Italy  researchers demonstrated the first  wireless  flying beetle cyborg  33  Engineers at the University of California at Berkeley have pioneered the design of a  remote controlled beetle   funded by the DARPA HI MEMS Program  Filmed evidence of this can be viewed here  34  This was followed later that year by the demonstration of wireless control of a  lift assisted  moth cyborg  35  Eventually researchers plan to develop HI MEMS for dragonflies  bees  rats and pigeons  36  37  For the HI MEMS cybernetic bug to be considered a success  it must fly 100 meters from a starting point  guided via computer into a controlled landing within 5 meters of a specific end point  Once landed  the cybernetic bug must remain in place  36   edit  In art The concept of the cyborg is often associated with science fiction  However  many artists have tried to create public awareness of cybernetic organisms  these can range from paintings to installations  Some artists who create such works are Neil Harbisson  Patricia Piccinini  I igo Manglano Ovalle  Steve Mann  Orlan  H R  Giger  Lee Bul  Wafaa Bilal  Tim Hawkinson and Stelarc  Stelarc is a performance artist who has visually probed and acoustically amplified his body  He uses medical instruments  prosthetics  robotics  virtual reality systems  the Internet and biotechnology to explore alternate  intimate and involuntary interfaces with the body  He has made three films of the inside of his body and has performed with a third hand and a virtual arm  Between 1976 1988 he completed 25 body suspension performances with hooks into the skin  For  Third Ear  he surgically constructed an extra ear within his arm that was internet enabled  making it an publicly accessible acoustical organ for people in other places  38  He is presently performing as his avatar from his second life site  39  Tim Hawkinson promotes the idea that bodies and machines are coming together as one  where human features are combined with technology to create the Cyborg  Hawkinson s piece Emoter presented how society is now dependent on technology  40  Wafaa Bilal is an Iraqi American performance artist who had a small 10 megapixel digital camera surgically implanted into the back of his head  part of a project entitled 3rd I  41  For one year  beginning 15 December 2010  an image is captured once per minute 24 hours a day and streamed live to www 3rdi me and the Mathaf  Arab Museum of Modern Art  The site also displays Bilal s location via GPS  Bilal says that the reason why he put the camera in the back of the head was to make an  allegorical statement about the things we don t see and leave behind   42  As a professor at NYU  this project has raised privacy issues  and so Bilal has been asked to ensure that his camera does not take photographs in NYU buildings  42  Machines are becoming more ubiquitous in the artistic process itself  with computerized drawing pads replacing pen and paper  and drum machines becoming nearly as popular as human drummers  This is perhaps most notable in generative art and music  Composers such as Brian Eno have developed and utilized software which can build entire musical scores from a few basic mathematical parameters  43   edit  Artists as cyborgs Artists have explored the term cyborg from a perspective involving imagination  Some work to make an abstract idea of technological and human bodily union apparent to reality in an art form utilizing varying mediums  from sculptures and drawings to digital renderings  Artists that seek to make cyborg based fantasies a reality often call themselves cyborg artists  or may consider their artwork  cyborg   How an artists and work may be considered cyborg will vary depending upon the interpreter s flexibility with the term  Scholars that rely upon a strict  technical description of cyborg  often going by Norbert Weiner s cybernetic theory and Manfred E  Clynes and Nathan S  Kline s first use of the term  would likely argue that most cyborg artists do not qualify to be considered cyborgs   44  Scholars considering a more flexible description of cyborgs may argue it incorporates more then cybernetics   45  Others may speak of defining subcategories  or specialized cyborg types  that qualify different levels of cyborg at which technology influences an individual  This may rang from technological instruments being external  temporary  and removable to being fully integrated and permanent   46  Nonetheless  cyborg artists are artists  Being so  it can be expected for them to incorporate the cyborg idea rather then a strict  technical representation of the term   47  seeing how their work will sometimes revolve around other purposes outside of cyborgism   44   edit  In body modification As medical technology becomes more advanced  some techniques and innovations are adopted by the body modification community  While not yet cyborgs in the strict definition of Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline  technological developments like implantable silicon silk electronics 48   augmented reality 49  and QR codes 50  are bridging the disconnect between technology and the body  Hypothetical technologies such as digital tattoo interfaces 51  52  would blend body modification aesthetics with interactivity and functionality  bringing transhumanist discourse into present day reality   edit  In popular culture Main article  Cyborgs in fiction See also  List of fictional cyborgs Cyborgs have become a well known part of science fiction literature and other media  Examples of fictional biologically based cyborgs include Spartans from Halo  RoboCop  Deus Ex  Replicants  Doctor Who s Daleks and Cybermen  Star Trek s Borg  Star Wars s  Darth Vader  Luke Skywalker  and General Grievous  and Steve Austin s The Six Million Dollar Man  Mechanically based cyborgs include Cylons  Terminators  Grox  Snatchers  and various manga and anime characters such as 8 Man  Kamen Rider  Motoko Kusanagi from Ghost in The Shell franchise  many Fullmetal Alchemist characters such as Edward Elric  Automail is not a form of Cybernetics   along with several Dragon Ball characters including Dr  Gero  Android 17  Android 18 and Android 20  From the comic book universes Tony Stark is a cyborg  after his Extremis and Bleeding Edge armor  and Victor  Cyborg  Stone  who was rebuilt with metallic limbs and implants   edit  Cyborgization in critical deaf studies Joseph Michael Valente  describes  cyborgization  as an attempt to codify  normalization  through cochlear implantation in young deaf children  Drawing from Paddy Ladd s work on Deaf epistemology and Donna Haraway s Cyborg ontology  Valente  use s  the concept of the cyborg as a way of agitating constructions of cyborg perfection  for the deaf child that would be to become fully hearing    He claims that cochlear implant manufacturers advertise and sell cochlear implants as a mechanical device as well as an uncomplicated medical  miracle cure   Valente criticizes cochlear implant researchers whose studies largely to date do not include cochlear implant recipients  despite cochlear implants having been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration  FDA  since 1984  53   edit  Cyborg Foundation In 2010  the Cyborg Foundation became the world s first international organization dedicated to help humans become cyborgs  54  The foundation was created by cyborg Neil Harbisson and Moon Ribas as a response to the growing amount of letters and emails received from people around the world interested in becoming a cyborg  55  The foundation s main aims are to extend human senses and abilities by creating and applying cybernetic extensions to the body  56  to promote the use of cybernetics in cultural events and to defend cyborg rights  57  In 2010  the foundation  based in Matar   Barcelona   was the overall winner of the Cre tic Awards  organized by Tecnocampus Matar   58   edit  References    Cyborgs and Space  1    in Astronautics  September 1960
