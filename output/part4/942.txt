often referred to as The Christian Church  The Disciples of Christ  or more simply as The Disciples  The Christian Church was a charter participant in the formation of both the World Council of Churches and the Federal Council of Churches  now the National Council of Churches   and it continues to be engaged in ecumenical conversations  The Disciples  local churches are congregationally governed  In 2008 there were 679 563 members in 3 714 congregations in North America  1  As of 2011  their website claims 661 544 members in 3 646 congregations  This difference indicates a decline of 18 019 members and a loss of 68 congregations across those three years  2  Contents 1 History 1 1 Stone 1 2 Campbells 1 3 Merging 1 4 Naming 1 5 First national convention and missionary movement 1 6

Christ  is shared by two groups  The Churches of Christ and the independent Christian churches and churches of Christ  They emerged from the same roots  3  The Stone Campbell movement began as two separate threads  each without knowledge of the other  during the Second Great Awakening in the early 19th century  The first of these two groups  led by Barton W  Stone began at Cane Ridge  Bourbon County  Kentucky  The group called themselves simply Christians  The second  began in western Pennsylvania and Virginia  now West Virginia   led by Thomas Campbell and his son  Alexander Campbell  Because the founders wanted to abandon all denominational labels  they used the biblical names for the followers of Jesus that they found in the Bible  4   edit  Stone Barton W  Stone Wikisource has original text related to this article  Last Will and Testament of The Springfield Presbytery Main article  Christians  Stone Movement  In 1801  the Cane Ridge Revival in Kentucky planted the seed for a movement in Kentucky and the Ohio River Valley to disassociate from denominationalism  In 1803 Stone and others withdrew from the Kentucky Presbytery and formed the Springfield Presbytery  The defining event of the Stone wing of the movement was the publication of the Last Will and Testament of The Springfield Presbytery  at Cane Ridge  Kentucky  in 1804   The Last Will  is a brief document in which Stone and five others announced their withdrawal from Presbyterianism and their intention to be solely part of the body of Christ  5  The writers appealed for the unity of all who follow Jesus  suggested the value of congregational self governance  and lifted the Bible as the source for understanding the will of God  They denounced the divisive use of the Augsburg Confession  6  Soon  they adopted the name  Christian  to identify their group  Thus  the remnants of the Springfield Presbytery became the Christian Church  7  It is estimated that the Christian Church numbered about 12 000 by 1830  8   edit  Campbells Thomas Campbell Main article  Disciples of Christ  Campbell Movement  Independently of Stone  the Campbell wing of the movement was launched when Thomas Campbell published the Declaration and Address of the Christian Association of Washington  in 1809  The Presbyterian Synod had suspended his ministerial credentials  In The Declaration and Address he set forth some of his convictions about the church of Jesus Christ  as he organized the Christian Association of Washington  not as a church but as an association of persons seeking to grow in faith  9  On May 4  1811  however  the Christian Association constituted itself as a congregationally governed church  With the building it then constructed at Brush Run  it became known as Brush Run Church  10  Young Alexander Campbell When their study of the New Testament led the reformers to begin to practice Baptism by Immersion  the nearby Redstone Baptist Association invited Brush Run Church to join with them for the purpose of fellowship  The reformers agreed provided that they would be  allowed to preach and to teach whatever they learned from the Scriptures   11  Thus began a sojourn for the reformers among the Baptists within the Redstone Baptist Association  1815 1824   While the reformers and the Baptists shared the same beliefs in baptism by immersion and congregational polity  it was soon clear that the reformers were not traditional Baptists  Within the Redstone Association  the differences became intolerable to some of the Baptist leaders  when Alexander Campbell began publishing a journal  The Christian Baptist  promoting reform  Campbell anticipated the conflict and moved his membership to a congregation of the Mahoning Baptist Association in 1824  12  Walter Scott In 1827  the Mahoning Association appointed reformer Walter Scott as an Evangelist  Through Scott s efforts  the Mahoning Association grew rapidly  In 1828  Thomas Campbell visited several of the congregations formed by Scott and heard him preach  The elder Campbell realized that Scott was bringing an important new dimension to the movement with his approach to evangelism  13  Several Baptist associations began disassociating congregations that refused to subscribe to the Philadelphia Confession  The Mahoning Association itself came under attack  In 1830  The Mahoning Baptist Association disbanded  Alexander ceased publication of The Christian Baptist  In January 1831  he began publication of the Millennial Harbinger  14   edit  Merging  Raccoon  John Smith The two groups united at High Street Meeting House  Lexington  Kentucky  with a handshake between Barton W  Stone and  Raccoon  John Smith  on Saturday  December 31  1831  15  Smith had been chosen  by those present  to speak on behalf of the followers of the Campbells  16  While contemporaneous accounts are clear that the handshake took place on Saturday  some historians have changed the date of the merger to Sunday  January 1  1832  17  The 1832 date has become generally accepted  The actual difference is about 20 hours  Two representatives of those assembled were appointed to carry the news of the union to all the churches  John Rogers  for the Christians and  Raccoon  John Smith for the reformers  Despite some challenges  the merger succeeded  18   edit  Naming With the merger  there was the challenge of what to call the new movement  Clearly  finding a Biblical  non sectarian name was important  Stone wanted to continue to use the name  Christians   Alexander Campbell insisted upon  Disciples of Christ   Walter Scott and Thomas Campbell sided with Stone  but the younger Campbell had strong reasons and would not yield  As a result  both names were used  The confusion over names has been present ever since  19  Prior to the 1906 separation  congregations would typically be named  Disciples of Christ    Christian Church   and  Church of Christ   However there are different practices by each  More than the name separates each church example  Independent Christian Church  will not accept a woman as a minister when some of the  Disciples of Christ  congregation will  These different congregations  Disciples of Christ  Church of Christ  and Independent Church  share many of the same beliefs and practices but there are  in fact  differences   edit  First national convention and missionary movement Alexander Campbell  Age 65 This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   December 2009  In 1849  the first National Convention was held at Cincinnati  Ohio  20  Alexander Campbell had concerns that holding conventions would lead the movement into divisive denominationalism  He did not attend the gathering  21  Among its actions  the convention elected Alexander Campbell its President and created the American Christian Missionary Society  ACMS   22  The formation of a missionary society set the stage for further  co operative  efforts  By the end of the century  the Foreign Christian Missionary Society and the Christian Women s Board of Missions were also engaged in missionary activities  Forming the ACMS did not reflect a consensus of the entire movement  Sponsorship of missionary activities became a divisive issue  In the succeeding decades  for some congregations and their leaders  co operative work through missionary societies and the adoption of instrumental music in church worship was straying too far from their conception of the early church  After the American Civil War  the schism grew   edit  Journals From the beginning of the movement  the free exchange of ideas among the people was fostered by the journals published by its leaders  Alexander Campbell published The Christian Baptist and The Millennial Harbinger  Barton W  Stone published The Christian Messenger  23  In a respectful way  both men routinely published the contributions of others whose positions were radically different from their own  Following Campbell s death in 1866  journals continued to keep the discussion and conversation alive  Between 1870 and 1900  two journals emerged as the most prominent  The Christian Standard was edited and published by Isaac Errett of Cincinnati  The Christian Evangelist was edited and published by J  H  Garrison from St  Louis  The two men enjoyed a friendly rivalry  and kept the dialog going within the movement  24  A third journal became part of the conversation with the publication in 1884 of The Christian Oracle  later to become The Christian Century  with an interdenominational appeal  25  In 1914  Garrison s Christian Publishing company was purchased by R  A  Long  who then established a non profit corporation   The Christian Board of Publication  as the Brotherhood publishing house  26   edit  Division In 1906  the U S  Religious Census listed Churches of Christ for the first time as a group which was separate and distinct from the Disciples of Christ  27  However  the division had been growing for years  with published reports as early as 1883  28  The most obvious distinction between the two groups was the Churches of Christ rejecting the use of musical instruments in worship  The controversy over musical instruments began in 1860  when some congregations introduced organs  traditionally associated with wealthier  denominational churches  More basic were the underlying approaches to Biblical interpretation  The Churches of Christ permitted only those practices found in accounts of New Testament worship  They could find no New Testament documentation of the use of instrumental music in worship  The Disciples  by contrast  considered permissible any practices that the New Testament did not expressly forbid  29  After the division  Disciples churches used  Christian Church  as the dominant designation for congregations  While music and the approach to missionary work were the most visible issues  there were also some deeper ones  The process that led to the separation had begun prior to the American Civil War  30  Following the 1906 separation by the Churches of Christ  additional controversies arose  Should missionary efforts be cooperative or should they be independently sponsored by congregations  Should new methods of Biblical analysis  developed in the late 19th century  be embraced in the study and interpretation of the Bible  31  The  cooperative  churches were generally more likely to adopt the new biblical study methods  During the first half of the 20th century  these opposing factions among the Christian Churches coexisted but with growing discomfort and tension  Among the cooperative churches  the three Missionary Societies merged into the United Christian Missionary Society in 1920  32  Human service ministries grew through the National Benevolent Association and provided assistance to orphans  the elderly and the disabled  By mid century  the cooperative Christian Churches and the independent Christian Churches were following different paths   edit  Restructure Following World War II  it became obvious that the organizations that had been developed in previous decades no longer effectively met the needs of the postwar era  33  After a number of discussions throughout the 1950s  the 1960 International Convention of Christian Churches adopted a process to  restructure  the entire organization  34  The Commission on Restructure  chaired by Granville T  Walker  held its first meeting on October 30  amp  November 1  1962  35  In 1968  the International Convention of Christian Churches  Disciples of Christ  adopted the Commission s proposed

December 2009  As an integral part of worship in most Christian Church  Disciples of Christ  congregations members celebrate the Lord s Supper  Most congregations also sing hymns  read from the Old and New Testaments of Christian Scripture  hear the word of God proclaimed through sermon or other medium and extend an invitation to become Christ s Disciples  As a congregational church  each congregation determines the nature of its worship  study  Christian service  and witness to the world  At the Lord s table  individuals are invited to acknowledge their faults and sins  to remember the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ  to remember their baptism  and to give thanks for God s redeeming love  38  The Christian Church  Disciples of Christ  believes that it is in the local congregations where people come  find  and know God as they gather in Christ s name  39  Because Disciples believe that the invitation to the table comes from Jesus Christ  communion is open to all who confess that Jesus Christ is Lord  regardless of their denominational affiliation  40  Baptism by immersion For most Disciples  communion is understood as the symbolic presence of Jesus within the gathered community  Most Disciple congregations practice believer s baptism in the form of immersion  believing it to be the form used in the New Testament  The experiences of yielding to Christ in being buried with him in the waters of baptism and rising to a new life  have profound meaning for the church  41   In essentials  Unity  In non essentials  Liberty  and in all things  Charity   19th Century slogan of the Stone Campbell Movement For modern Disciples the one essential is the acceptance of Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior  and obedience to him in baptism  42  There is no requirement to give assent to any other statement of belief or creed  Nor is there any  official  interpretation of the Bible  43  Hierarchical doctrine was traditionally rejected by Disciples as human made and divisive  and subsequently  freedom of belief and scriptural interpretation allows many Disciples to question or even deny beliefs common in doctrinal churches such as the Incarnation  the Trinity  and the Atonement  Beyond the essential commitment to follow Jesus there is a tremendous freedom of belief and interpretation  As the basic teachings of Jesus are studied and applied to life  there is the freedom to interpret Jesus  teaching in different ways  As would be expected from such an approach  there is a wide diversity among Disciples in what individuals and congregations believe  It is not uncommon to find individuals who seemingly hold diametrically opposed beliefs within the same congregation affirming one another s journeys of faith as sisters and brothers in Christ  Members and seekers are encouraged to take being disciples seriously  meaning that they are student followers of Jesus  Often the best teaching comes in the form   I ll tell you what I think  but read the Bible for yourself  and then study and pray about it  Decide in what ways God is calling you to be a follower of Jesus   Modern Disciples reject the use of creeds as  tests of faith   that is  as required beliefs  necessary to be accepted as a follower of Jesus  Although Disciples respect the great creeds of the church as informative affirmations of faith  they are never seen as binding  Since the adoption of The Design of the Christian Church  Disciples of Christ   44  in 1968  Disciples have celebrated a sense of unity in reading the preamble to the Design publicly  It is as a meaningful affirmation of faith  not binding upon any member  It was originally intended to remind readers that this Church seeks God through Jesus Christ  even when it adopts a design for its business affairs        the church of Christ upon earth is essentially  intentionally  and constitutionally one  consisting of all those in every place that profess their faith in Christ and obedience to him in all things       Thomas Campbell   Proposition 1 of the Declaration and Address The Disciples celebrate their oneness with all who seek God through Jesus Christ  throughout time and regardless of location  That oneness is symbolized in the open invitation to communion for all who have professed faith in Christ without regard to church affiliation  45  In local communities  congregations share with churches of other denominations in joint worship and in community Christian service  Ecumenical cooperation and collaboration with other Christian Communions has long been practiced  by the Regions  At the General Church level  the Council on Christian Unity 46  coordinates the ecumenical activities of the church  The Disciples continues to relate to the National Council of Churches  of which it was a founding member  It shares in the dialog and in the theological endeavors of the World Council of Churches  The Disciples has been a full participant in the Consultation on Church Union since it began in the sixties  It continues to support those ongoing conversations which have taken on the title Churches Uniting in Christ  The goal of these endeavors is not the merger into some  Super Church   but rather to discover ways to celebrate and proclaim the unity and oneness that is Christ s gift to his church   edit  Congregations Congregations of the Christian Church are self governing in the tradition of congregational polity  They select their own leadership  own their own property  and manage their own affairs  In Disciples congregations  the priesthood of all believers finds its expression in worship and Christian service  Typically  Lay Elders  rather than ordained ministers  preside at the Lord s Table in celebration of Communion  The lay Elders and called Pastors provide spiritual oversight and care for members in partnership with one another  47   edit  Regional ministries This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   December 2009  The Regional Churches of the Christian Church provide resources for leadership development and opportunities for Christian fellowship beyond the local congregation  They have taken responsibility for the nurture and support of those individuals seeking to discern God s call to service as ordained or licensed ministers  Typically  they organize summer camping experiences for children and youth  48  Regional churches assist congregations who are seeking ministers and ministers who are seeking congregations  Regional leadership is available on request to assist congregations that face conflict  Though they have no authority to direct the life of any congregation  the Regional Churches are analogous to the middle judicatories of other denominations   edit  General Ministries This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   December 2009  The Christian Church  Disciples of Christ  at the  General Church  level consists of a number of self governing agencies  which focus upon specific Christian witnesses to the world that have emerged in the dialog within the movement since before the first convention in 1849  Typically  these ministries have a scope that is larger than Regional Ministries  and often have a global perspective  The church agencies report to the General Assembly  which meets biennially in odd numbered years  The General Minister and President  GMP  is the designated leader for the General Church  but does not have the administrative authority to direct any of the general church agencies other than  The Office of General Minister and President   The GMP has influence that derives from the respect of the church much as the pastor of a local church leads a local congregation  The General Ministries are

development agency  50  It works closely with Church World Service and church related organizations in countries around the world where disasters strike  providing emergency aid  The General Church has challenged the entire denomination to work for a 2020 Vision 51  for the first two decades of the 21st Century  Together the denomination is well on the way to achieving its four foci  Seeking racial justice  which it describes as becoming a pro reconciling anti racist church  52  Forming 1 000 new congregations across the United States and Canada by 2020  53  Seeking God s transformation

regions and the general church are detailed in The Design of the Christian Church  Disciples of Christ   56  57  At the 2005 General Assembly  over 3000 delegates voted nearly unanimously to elect the Sharon E  Watkins as General Minister and President of the denomination  58  Watkins was the first woman to be elected as the presiding minister of a mainline Protestant denomination  59   edit  Chalice The logo of the Christian Church  Disciples of Christ  is a red chalice with a white St  Andrew s Cross  The chalice represents the centrality of Communion to the life of the church  The cross of Saint Andrew is a reminder of the ministry of each person and the importance of evangelism  and recalls the denomination s Scottish Presbyterian ancestry  After the 1968 General Assembly  the Administrative Committee charged a sub committee with the task of proposing a symbol for the church  Hundreds of designs were submitted  but none seemed right  By November the Deputy General Minister and President  William Howland  suggested that the committee s staff consultant and chairperson agree on a specific proposal and bring it back to the committee  that meant Robert L  Friedly of the Office of Interpretation and Ronald E  Osborn  citation needed  On January 20  1970  the two men sat down for lunch  With a red felt tip pen  Osborn began to scrawl a Saint Andrew s cross circumscribed inside a chalice on his placemat  citation needed  Immediately  Friedly dispatched the crude drawing to Bruce Tilsley  a commercial artist and member of Central Christian Church of Denver  with the plea that he prepare an artistic version of the ideas  Tilsley responded with two or three sketches  from which was selected the now familiar red chalice  Use of the proposed symbol became so prevalent that there was little debate when official adoption was considered at the 1971 General Assembly  citation needed  The chalice is a registered trademark of the Christian Church  Disciples of Christ   Congregations and ministries of the Christian Church  Disciples of Christ  are free to use the chalice in publications  web sites and other media  Organizations not affiliated with the Christian Church  Disciples of Christ  are asked to obtain permission  60  Because most congregations call themselves  Christian Churches   the chalice has become a simple way to identify Disciples of Christ Churches through signage  letterhead  and other forms of publicity   edit  Membership trends Like many other mainline Protestant denominations  the Christian Church  Disciples of Christ  has experienced a significant loss of membership since the middle of the 20th century  Membership peaked in 1958 at just under 2 million  61  In the early 1990s  membership dropped below 1 million  In 2006  the denomination reported 3 774 churches and 698 686 members  62  Members are concentrated in the lower Midwest and parts of the South  The states with the highest rates of membership are Kansas  Missouri  Iowa  Kentucky  and Oklahoma  63  Texas has the largest number of members  with over 100 000   edit  Affiliated academic institutions This section needs additional
