the United States of America is the head of state and head of government of the United States  The president leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander in chief of the United States Armed Forces  Article II of the U S  Constitution vests the executive power of the United States in the president and charges him with the execution of federal law  alongside the responsibility of appointing federal executive  diplomatic  regulatory  and judicial officers  and concluding treaties with foreign powers  with the advice and consent of the Senate  The president is further empowered to grant federal pardons and reprieves  and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of Congress under extraordinary circumstances  5  Since the founding of the United States  the power of the president and the federal government have grown substantially 6  and each modern president  despite possessing no formal legislative powers beyond signing or vetoing congressionally passed bills  is largely responsible for dictating the legislative agenda of his party and the foreign and domestic policy of the United States  7  The president is frequently described as the most powerful person in the world  8  9  10  11  12  13  The president is indirectly elected by the people through the Electoral College to a four year term  and is one of only two nationally elected federal officers  the other being the Vice President of the United States  14  The Twenty second Amendment  adopted in 1951  prohibits anyone from ever being elected to the presidency for a third full term  It also prohibits a person from being elected to the presidency more than once if that person previously had served as president  or acting president  for more than two years of another person s term as president  In all  43 individuals have served 55 four year terms  15  On January 20  2009  Barack Obama became the 44th and current president  Contents 1 Origin 2 Powers and duties 2 1 Article

1776  the Thirteen Colonies  acting through the Second Continental Congress  declared political independence from Great Britain during the American Revolution  The new states  though also independent of each other  16  recognized the necessity of coordinating their efforts against the British  17  Desiring to avoid anything that remotely resembled a monarchy  Congress negotiated the Articles of Confederation to establish a weak alliance between the states  16  As a central authority  Congress under the Articles was without any legislative power  it could make its own resolutions  determinations  and regulations  but not any laws  nor any taxes or local commercial regulations enforceable upon citizens  17  This institutional design reflected the conception of how Americans believed the deposed British system of Crown and Parliament ought to have functioned with respect to the royal dominion  a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire  17  Out from under any monarchy  the states assigned some formerly royal prerogatives  e g   making war  receiving ambassadors  etc   to Congress  while keeping the rest for themselves  The Articles took effect on March 1  1781  when Maryland became the final state to ratify them  In 1783  the Treaty of Paris secured independence for the former colonies  With peace at hand  the states each turned toward their own internal affairs  16  By 1786  Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak  their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another  witnessed their hard currency pouring into foreign markets to pay for imports  their Mediterranean commerce preyed upon by North African pirates  and their foreign financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest  16  Civil and political unrest loomed  Aiming toward a first step of resolving interstate commercial antagonisms  Virginia called for a trade conference in Annapolis  Maryland  set for September 1786  When the convention failed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states  the Annapolis delegates called for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles  to be held the next spring in Philadelphia  Prospects for the next convention appeared bleak until James Madison and Edmund Randolph succeeded in securing George Washington s attendance as a delegate to Philadelphia  16  18  When the Constitutional Convention convened in May 1787  the 12 state delegations in attendance  Rhode Island was absent  brought with them an accumulated experience over a diverse set of institutional arrangements between legislative and executive branches from within their respective state governments  Most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers  elected annually by the legislature to a single term only  sharing power with an executive council  and countered by a strong legislature  16 New York offered the greatest exception  having a strong  unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three year term  and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter  16  It was through the closed door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the U S  Constitution emerged  Powers and duties Article I legislative role Obama signing legislation at the Resolute desk  The first power the Constitution confers upon the president is the veto  The Presentment Clause requires any bill passed by Congress to be presented to the president before it can become law  Once the legislation has been presented  the president has three options  Sign the legislation  the bill then becomes law  Veto the legislation and return it to Congress  expressing any objections  the bill does not become law  unless each house of Congress votes to override the veto by a two thirds vote  Take no action  In this instance  the president neither signs nor vetoes the legislation  After 10 days  not counting Sundays  two possible outcomes emerge  If Congress is still convened  the bill becomes law  If Congress has adjourned  thus preventing the return of the legislation  the bill does not become law  This latter outcome is known as the pocket veto  In 1996  Congress attempted to enhance the president s veto power with the Line Item Veto Act  The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill  particularly any new spending  any amount of discretionary spending  or any new limited tax benefit  Once a president had stricken the item  Congress could pass that particular item again  If the president then vetoed the new legislation  Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means  a two thirds vote in both houses  In Clinton v  City of New York  524 U S  417  1998   the U S  Supreme Court ruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional  Article II executive powers War and foreign affairs powers Abraham Lincoln  the 16th President of the United States  successfully preserved the Union during the American Civil War  Perhaps the most important of all presidential powers is command of the United States armed forces as commander in chief  While the power to declare war is constitutionally vested in Congress  the president commands and directs the military and is responsible for planning military strategy  The framers of the Constitution took care to limit the president s powers regarding the military  Alexander Hamilton explains this in Federalist No  69  The President is to be commander in chief of the army and navy of the United States      It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces     while that  the power  of the British king extends to the DECLARING of war and to the RAISING and REGULATING of fleets and armies  all  of  which     would appertain to the legislature  19   Emphasis in the original   Congress  pursuant to the War Powers Resolution  must authorize any troop deployments longer than 60 days  although that process relies on triggering mechanisms that have never been employed  rendering it ineffectual  20  Additionally  Congress provides a check to presidential military power through its control over military spending and regulation  While historically presidents initiated the process for going to war  21  22  critics have charged that there have been several conflicts in which presidents did not get official declarations  including Theodore Roosevelt s military move into Panama in 1903  21  the Korean War  21  the Vietnam War  21  the invasions of Grenada in 1983 23  and Panama in 1990  24  Along with the armed forces  the president also directs U S  foreign policy  Through the Department of State and the Department of Defense  the president is responsible for the protection of Americans abroad and of foreign nationals in the United States  The president decides whether to recognize new nations and new governments  and negotiates treaties with other nations  which become binding on the United States when approved by two thirds vote of the Senate  Although not constitutionally provided  presidents also sometimes employ  executive agreements  in foreign relations  These agreements frequently regard administrative policy choices germane to executive power  for example  the extent to which either country presents an armed presence in a given area  how each country will enforce copyright treaties  or how each country will process foreign mail  However  the 20th century witnessed a vast expansion of the use of executive agreements  and critics have challenged the extent of that use as supplanting the treaty process and removing constitutionally prescribed checks and balances over the executive in foreign relations  Supporters counter that the agreements offer a pragmatic solution when the need for swift  secret  and or concerted action arises  Administrative powers The president is the head of the executive branch of the federal government and is constitutionally obligated to  take care that the laws be faithfully executed   The executive branch has over four million employees  including members of the military  25  Presidents make numerous executive branch appointments  an incoming president may make up to 6 000 before he takes office and 8 000 more during his term  Ambassadors  members of the Cabinet  and other federal officers  are all appointed by a president with the  advice and consent  of a majority of the Senate  Appointments made while the Senate is in recess are temporary and expire at the end of the next session of the Senate  The power of a president to fire executive officials has long been a contentious political issue  Generally  a president may remove purely executive officials at his discretion  26  However  Congress can curtail and constrain a president s authority to fire commissioners of independent regulatory agencies and certain inferior executive officers by statute  27  The president possesses the ability to direct much of the executive branch through executive orders that are grounded in federal law or constitutionally granted executive power  Executive orders are reviewable by federal courts and can be repealed by federal legislation  To manage the growing federal bureaucracy  Presidents have gradually surrounded themselves with many layers of staff  who were eventually organized into the Executive Office of the President of the United States  Within the Executive Office  the President s innermost layer of aides  and their assistants  are located in the White House Office  Juridical powers The president also has the power to nominate federal judges  including members of the United States courts of appeals and the Supreme Court of the United States  However  these nominations do require Senate confirmation  Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance  When nominating judges to U S  district courts  presidents often respect the long standing tradition of Senatorial courtesy  Presidents may also grant pardons and reprieves  as is often done just before the end of a presidential term  not without controversy  28  29  30  Historically  two doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy  The first is executive privilege  which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties  George Washington first claimed privilege when Congress requested to see Chief Justice John Jay s notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with Great Britain  While not enshrined in the Constitution  or any other law  Washington s action created the precedent for the privilege  When Richard Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the Watergate scandal  the Supreme Court ruled in United States v  Nixon  418 U S  683  1974   that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution  When President Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the Lewinsky scandal  the Supreme Court ruled in Clinton v  Jones  520 U S  681  1997   that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits  These cases established the legal precedent that executive privilege is valid  although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined  Additionally  federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees  but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president  31  President George W  Bush delivering the 2007 State of the Union Address  with Vice President Cheney and Speaker of the House Pelosi behind him  The state secrets privilege allows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from discovery in legal proceedings if such release would harm national security  Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when Thomas Jefferson refused to release military documents in the treason trial of Aaron Burr and again in 1876 in Totten v  United States  when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy  32  However  the privilege was not formally recognized by the U S  Supreme Court until United States v  Reynolds  1953  where it was held to be a common law evidentiary privilege  33  Before the September 11 attacks  use of the privilege had been rare  but increasing in frequency  34  Since 2001  the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation  thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims  as in the Ninth Circuit s ruling in Mohamed v  Jeppesen Dataplan  33  35  36  Critics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions  37  38  Legislative facilitator Representing the executive branch of government  the president cannot simultaneously hold a seat in Congress  Therefore  the president cannot directly introduce legislative proposals for consideration in Congress  The president  however  can take an indirect role in shaping legislation  especially if the president s political party has a majority in one or both houses of Congress  For example  the president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress  The president can further influence the legislative branch through constitutionally mandated  periodic reports to Congress  These reports may be either written or oral  but today are given as the State of the Union address  which often outlines the president s legislative proposals for the coming year  In the 20th century critics began charging that too many legislative and budgetary powers have slid into the hands of presidents that should belong to Congress  As the head of the executive branch  presidents control a vast array of agencies that can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress  One critic charged that presidents could appoint a  virtual army of  czars    each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House   39  Presidents have been criticized for making signing statements when signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it  40  This practice has been criticized by the American Bar Association as unconstitutional  41  Conservative commentator George Will wrote of an  increasingly swollen executive branch  and  the eclipse of Congress   42  According to Article II  Section 3  Clause 2 of the Constitution  the president may convene either or both houses of Congress  If both houses cannot agree on a date of adjournment  the president may appoint a date for Congress to adjourn  Ceremonial roles President Woodrow Wilson throwing out the ceremonial first ball on Opening Day  1916 As head of state  the president can fulfill traditions established by previous presidents  William Howard Taft started the tradition of throwing out the ceremonial first pitch in 1910 at Griffith Stadium  Washington  D C   on the Washington Senators  Opening Day  Every president since Taft  except for Jimmy Carter  threw out at least one ceremonial first ball or pitch for Opening Day  the All Star Game  or the World Series  usually with much fanfare  43  Other presidential traditions are associated with American holidays  Rutherford B  Hayes began in 1878 the first White House egg rolling for local children  44  Beginning in 1947 during the Harry S  Truman administration  every Thanksgiving the president is presented with a live domestic turkey during the annual national thanksgiving turkey presentation held at the White House  Since 1989  when the custom of  pardoning  the turkey was formalized by George H  W  Bush  the turkey has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural life  45  Presidential traditions also involve the president s role as head of government  Many outgoing presidents since James Buchanan traditionally give advice to their successor during the presidential transition  46  Ronald Reagan and his successors have also left a private message on the desk of the Oval Office on Inauguration Day for the incoming president  47  Four ruffles and flourishes and  Hail to the Chief   long version  Problems listening to this file  See media help  During a state visit by a foreign head of state  the president typically hosts a State Arrival Ceremony held on the South Lawn  a custom begun by John F  Kennedy in 1961  48  This is followed by a state dinner given by the president which is held in the State Dining Room later in the evening  49  The modern presidency holds the president as one of the nation s premier celebrities  Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration public relations officials as well as by presidents themselves  One critic described the presidency as  propagandized leadership  which has a  mesmerizing power surrounding the office   50  Administration public relations managers staged carefully crafted photo ops of smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras  51  One critic wrote the image of John F  Kennedy was described as carefully framed  in rich detail  which  drew on the power of myth  regarding the incident of PT 109 52  and wrote that Kennedy understood how to use images to further his presidential ambitions  53  As a result  some political commentators have opined that American voters have unrealistic expectations of presidents  voters expect a president to  drive the economy  vanquish enemies  lead the free world  comfort tornado victims  heal the national soul and protect borrowers from hidden credit card fees   54  Evolution of power and duties Most of the nation s Founding Fathers expected the Congress  which was the first branch of government described in the Constitution  to be the dominant branch of government  they did not expect a strong executive  55  However  the power of the presidency has shifted over time  and some today would describe the modern presidency as too powerful  56  57  unchecked  unbalanced  58  and  monarchist  in nature  59  Critic Dana D  Nelson believes presidents over the past thirty years have worked towards  undivided presidential control of the executive branch and its agencies   60  She criticizes proponents of the unitary executive for expanding  the many existing uncheckable executive powers   such as executive orders  decrees  memorandums  proclamations  national security directives and legislative signing statements   that already allow presidents to enact a good deal of foreign and domestic policy without aid  interference or consent from Congress   60  Scott Shane wrote that the expanded presidency was  the greatest threat ever to individual freedom and democratic rule   61  Selection process George Washington  the first President of the United States Eligibility Article II  Section 1  Clause 5 of the Constitution sets the principal qualifications one must meet to be eligible to the office of president  A president must  be a natural born citizen of the United States  note 1  be at least thirty five years old  have been a permanent resident in the United States for at least fourteen years  A person who meets the above qualifications is still disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions  Under the Twenty second Amendment  no person can be elected president more than twice  The amendment also specifies that if any eligible person who serves as president or acting president for more than two years of a term for which some other eligible person was elected president  the former can only be elected president once  Scholars disagree whether anyone no longer eligible to be elected president could be elected vice president  pursuant to the qualifications set out under the Twelfth Amendment  62  Under Article I  Section 3  Clause 7  upon conviction in impeachment cases  the Senate has the option of disqualifying convicted individuals from holding other federal offices  including the presidency  63  Under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment  no person who swore an oath to support the Constitution  and later rebelled against the United States  can become president  However  this disqualification can be lifted by a two thirds vote of each house of Congress  Campaigns and nomination Main articles  United States presidential primary  United States presidential nominating convention  United States presidential election debates  and United States presidential election The modern presidential campaign begins before the primary elections  which the two major political parties use to clear the field of candidates before their national nominating conventions  where the most successful candidate is made the party s nominee for president  Typically  the party s presidential candidate chooses a vice presidential nominee  and this choice is rubber stamped by the convention  Nominees participate in nationally televised debates  and while the debates are usually restricted to the Democratic and Republican nominees  third party candidates may be invited  such as Ross Perot in the 1992 debates  Nominees campaign across the country to explain their views  convince voters and solicit contributions  Much of the modern electoral process is concerned with winning swing states through frequent visits and mass media advertising drives  Election and oath Main articles  Electoral College  United States  and Oath of office of the President of the United States A map of the United States showing the number of electoral votes allocated to each state  270 electoral votes are required for a majority out of 538 overall  Presidents are elected indirectly in the United States  A number of electors  collectively known as the Electoral College  officially select the president  On Election Day  voters in each of the states and the District of Columbia cast ballots for these electors  Each state is allocated a number of electors  equal to the size of its delegation in both Houses of Congress combined  Generally  the ticket that wins the most votes in a state wins all of that state s electoral votes and thus has its slate of electors chosen to vote in the Electoral College  The winning slate of electors meet at its state s capital on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December  about six weeks after the election  to vote  They then send a record of that vote to Congress  The vote of the electors is opened by the sitting vice president  acting in his capacity as President of the Senate and read aloud to a joint session of the incoming Congress  which was elected at the same time as the president  Pursuant to the Twentieth Amendment  the president s term of office begins at noon on January 20 of the year following the election  This date  known as Inauguration Day  marks the beginning of the four year terms of both the president and the vice president  Before executing the powers of the office  a president is constitutionally required to take the presidential oath  I do solemnly swear  or affirm  that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States  and will to the best of my Ability  preserve  protect and defend the Constitution of the United States  64  Although not required  presidents have traditionally palmed a Bible while swearing the oath and have added   So help me God   to the end of the oath  Further  though no law requires that the oath of office be administered by any specific person  presidents are traditionally sworn in by the Chief Justice of the United States  Tenure and term limits Franklin D  Roosevelt was elected to four terms before the adoption of the Twenty second Amendment  The term of office for president and vice president is four years  George Washington  the first president  set an unofficial precedent of serving only two terms  which subsequent presidents followed until 1940  Before Franklin D  Roosevelt  attempts at a third term were encouraged by supporters of Ulysses S  Grant and Theodore Roosevelt  neither of these attempts succeeded  In 1940  Franklin D  Roosevelt declined to seek a third term  but allowed his political party to  draft  him as its presidential candidate and was subsequently elected to a third term  In 1941  the United States entered World War II  leading voters to elect Roosevelt to a fourth term in 1944  After the war  and in response to Roosevelt being elected to third and fourth terms  the Twenty second Amendment was adopted  The amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice  or once if that person served more than half of another president s term  Harry S  Truman  who was president when the amendment was adopted  and so by the amendment s provisions exempt from its limitation  also briefly sought a third  a second full  term before withdrawing from the 1952 election  Since the amendment s adoption  four presidents have served two full terms  Dwight D  Eisenhower  Ronald Reagan  Bill Clinton and George W  Bush  Jimmy Carter and George H  W  Bush sought a second term  but were defeated  Richard Nixon was elected to a second term  but resigned before completing it  Lyndon B  Johnson was the only president under the amendment to be eligible to serve more than two terms in total  having served for only fourteen months following John F  Kennedy s assassination  However  Johnson withdrew from the 1968 Democratic Primary  surprising many Americans  Gerald Ford sought a full term  after serving out the last two years and five months of Nixon s second term  but was not elected  Vacancy or disability See also  Twenty fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution  United States presidential line of succession  Presidential Succession Act  and Impeachment in the United States Vacancies in the office of president may arise under several possible circumstances  death  resignation and removal from office  Article II  Section 4 of the Constitution allows the House of Representatives to impeach high federal officials  including the president  for  treason  bribery  or other high crimes and misdemeanors   Article I  Section 3  Clause 6 gives the Senate the power to remove impeached officials from office  given a two thirds vote to convict  The House has thus far impeached two presidents  Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998  Neither was subsequently convicted by the Senate  however  Johnson was acquitted by just one vote  Under Section 3 of the Twenty fifth Amendment  the president may transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president  who then becomes acting president  by transmitting a statement to the Speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate stating the reasons for the transfer  The president resumes the discharge of the presidential powers and duties when he transmits  to those two officials  a written declaration stating that resumption  This transfer of power may occur for any reason the president considers appropriate  in 2002 and again in 2007  President George W  Bush briefly transferred presidential authority to Vice President Dick Cheney  In both cases  this was done to accommodate a medical procedure which required Bush to be sedated  both times  Bush returned to duty later the same day  65  Under Section 4 of the Twenty fifth Amendment  the vice president  in conjunction with a majority of the Cabinet  may transfer the presidential powers and duties from the president to the vice president by transmitting a written declaration to the Speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate that the president is unable to discharge the presidential powers and duties  If this occurs  then the vice president will assume the presidential powers and duties as acting president  however  the president can declare that no such inability exists and resume the discharge of the presidential powers and duties  If the vice president and Cabinet contest this claim  it is up to Congress  which must meet within two days if not already in session  to decide the merit of the claim  The United States Constitution mentions the resignation of the president but does not regulate the form of such a resignation or the conditions for its validity  Pursuant to federal law  the only valid evidence of the president s resignation is a written instrument to that effect  signed by the president and delivered to the office of the Secretary of State  66  This has only occurred once  when Richard Nixon delivered a letter to Henry Kissinger to that effect  The Constitution states that the vice president becomes president upon the removal from office  death or resignation of the preceding president  If the offices of president and vice president both are either vacant or have a disabled holder of that office  the next officer in the presidential line of succession  the Speaker of the House  becomes acting president  The line then extends to the president pro tempore of the Senate  followed by every member of the Cabinet in a set order  Compensation Presidential pay history Date established Salary Salary in 2009 dollars

significant careers after leaving office  Prominent examples include William Howard Taft s tenure as Chief Justice of the United States and Herbert Hoover s work on government reorganization after World War II  Grover Cleveland  whose bid for reelection failed in 1888  was elected president again four years later in 1892  Two former presidents served in Congress after leaving the White House

Each president since Herbert Hoover has created a repository known as a presidential library for preserving and making available his papers  records and other documents and materials  Completed libraries are deeded to and maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration  NARA   the initial funding for building and equipping each library must come from private  non federal sources  citation needed  There are currently thirteen presidential libraries in the NARA system  There are also a number of presidential libraries maintained by state governments and private foundations  such as the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum  which is run by the State of Illinois  As many presidents live for many years after leaving office  several of them have personally overseen the building and opening of their own presidential libraries  some even making arrangements for their own burial at the site  Several presidential libraries therefore contain the graves of the president they document  such as the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda  California and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley  California  The graves are viewable by the general public visiting these libraries  See also Government of the United States portal Categories Category Lists relating to the United States presidency Category United States

act to disapprove the conflict  the cessation of all hostilities is required in 60 to 90 days merely if Congress fails to act  Many have criticized this aspect of the Resolution as unwise and

1953  and the election of Jimmy Carter  in 1976  there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege  Between 1977 and 2001  there were a total of fifty one reported cases in
