extensive  the 7th most populous  and the 10th most densely populated of the 50 United States  The state s capital is Columbus  The name  Ohio  originated from Iroquois word ohi yo   meaning  great river   16  17  18  19  20  The state  originally partitioned from the Northwest Territory  was admitted to the Union as the 17th state  and the first under the Northwest Ordinance  on March 1  1803  8  21  Although there are conflicting narratives regarding the origin of the nickname  Ohio is historically known as the  Buckeye State   relating to the Ohio buckeye tree  and Ohioans are also known as  Buckeyes   1  The government of Ohio is composed of the executive branch  led by the Governor  the legislative branch  which comprises the Ohio General Assembly  and the judicial branch  which is led by the Supreme Court  Currently  Ohio occupies 18 seats in the United States House of Representatives  22  Ohio is known for its status as both a swing state 23  and a bellwether 23  in national elections  Contents 1 Geography 1 1 Climate 1 1 1 Records 1 2 Earthquakes 2 Major cities 3 History 3 1 Native Americans 3 2 Colonial and Revolutionary eras 3 3 Northwest Territory  1787 1803 3 4

an asset for economic growth and expansion  Because Ohio links the Northeast to the Midwest  much cargo and business traffic passes through its borders along its well developed highways  Ohio has the nation s 10th largest highway network  and is within a one day drive of 50  of North America s population and 70  of North America s manufacturing capacity  24  To the north  Lake Erie gives Ohio 312 miles  502 km  of coastline  25  which allows for numerous seaports  Ohio s southern border is defined by the Ohio River  with the border being at the 1793 low water mark on the north side of the river   and much of the northern border is defined by Lake Erie  Ohio s neighbors are Pennsylvania to the east  Michigan to the northwest  Ontario Canada  to the north  Indiana to the west  Kentucky on the south  and West Virginia on the southeast  Ohio s borders were defined by metes and bounds in the Enabling Act of 1802 as follows  Bounded on the east by the Pennsylvania line  on the south by the Ohio River  to the mouth of the Great Miami River  on the west by the line drawn due north from the mouth of the Great Miami aforesaid  and on the north by an east and west line drawn through the southerly extreme of Lake Michigan  running east after intersecting the due north line aforesaid  from the mouth of the Great Miami until it shall intersect Lake Erie or the territorial line  and thence with the same through Lake Erie to the Pennsylvania line aforesaid  The Ohio coast of Lake Erie  Note that Ohio is bounded by the Ohio River  but nearly all of the river itself belongs to Kentucky and West Virginia  In 1980  the U S  Supreme Court held that  based on the wording of the cessation of territory by Virginia  which  at that time included what is now Kentucky and West Virginia   the boundary between Ohio and Kentucky  and by implication  West Virginia  is the northern low water mark of the river as it existed in 1792  26  Ohio has only that portion of the river between the river s 1792 low water mark and the present high water mark  The border with Michigan has also changed  as a result of the Toledo War  to angle slightly northeast to the north shore of the mouth of the Maumee River  Much of Ohio features glaciated plains  with an exceptionally flat area in the northwest being known as the Great Black Swamp  This glaciated region in the northwest and central state is bordered to the east and southeast first by a belt known as the glaciated Allegheny Plateau  and then by another belt known as the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau  Most of Ohio is of low relief  but the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau features rugged hills and forests  Physical geography of Ohio  The rugged southeastern quadrant of Ohio  stretching in an outward bow like arc along the Ohio River from the West Virginia Panhandle to the outskirts of Cincinnati  forms a distinct socio economic unit  Geologically similar to parts of West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania  this area s coal mining legacy  dependence on small pockets of old manufacturing establishments  and distinctive regional dialect set this section off from the rest of the state  In 1965 the United States Congress passed the Appalachian Regional Development Act  at attempt to  address the persistent poverty and growing economic despair of the Appalachian Region   27  This act defines 29 Ohio counties as part of Appalachia  28  While 1 3 of Ohio s land mass is part of the federally defined Appalachian region  only 12 8  of Ohioans live there  1 476 million people   29  Map of Ohio  Significant rivers within the state include the Cuyahoga River  Great Miami River  Maumee River  Muskingum River  and Scioto River  The rivers in the northern part of the state drain into the northern Atlantic Ocean via Lake Erie and the St  Lawrence River  and the rivers in the southern part of the state drain into the Gulf of Mexico via the Ohio River and then the Mississippi  The worst weather disaster in Ohio history occurred along the Great Miami River in 1913  Known as the Great Dayton Flood  the entire Miami River watershed flooded  including the downtown business district of Dayton  As a result  the Miami Conservancy District was created as the first major flood plain engineering project in Ohio and the United States  30  Grand Lake St  Marys in the west central part of the state was constructed as a supply of water for canals in the canal building era of 1820 1850  For many years this body of water  over 20 square miles  52 km2   was the largest artificial lake in the world  It should be noted that Ohio s canal building projects were not the economic fiasco that similar efforts were in other states  Some cities  such as Dayton  owe their industrial emergence to location on canals  and as late as 1910 interior canals carried much of the bulk freight of the state  Climate The climate of Ohio is a humid continental climate  Koppen climate classification Dfa  throughout most of the state except in the extreme southern counties of Ohio s Bluegrass region section which are located on the northern periphery of the humid subtropical climate and Upland South region of the United States  Summers are typically hot and humid throughout the state  while winters generally range from cool to cold  Precipitation in Ohio is moderate year round  Severe weather is not uncommon in the state  although there are typically fewer tornado reports in Ohio than in states located in what is known as the Tornado Alley  Severe lake effect snowstorms are also not uncommon on the southeast shore of Lake Erie  which is located in an area designated as the Snowbelt  Although predominantly not in a subtropical climate  some warmer climate flora and fauna does reach well into Ohio  For instance  a number of trees with more southern ranges  such as the blackjack oak  Quercus marilandica  are found at their northernmost in Ohio just north of the Ohio River  Also evidencing this climatic transition from a subtropical to continental climate  several plants such as the Southern magnolia  Magnolia grandiflora   Albizia julibrissin  mimosa   Crape Myrtle  and even the occasional Needle Palm are hardy landscape materials regularly used as street  yard  and garden plantings in the Bluegrass region of Ohio  but these same plants will simply not thrive in much of the rest of the State  This interesting change may be observed while traveling through Ohio on Interstate 75 from Cincinnati to Toledo  the observant traveler of this diverse state may even catch a glimpse of Cincinnati s common wall lizard  one of the few examples of permanent  subtropical  fauna in Ohio  Records The highest recorded temperature was 113  F  45  C   near Gallipolis on July 21  1934  31  The lowest recorded temperature was  39  F   39  C   at Milligan on February 10  1899  32  Earthquakes Although few have registered as noticeable to the average citizen  more than 30 earthquakes occurred in Ohio between 2002 and 2007  and more than 200 quakes with a magnitude of 2 0 or higher have occurred since 1776  33  The most substantial known earthquake in Ohio history was the Anna  Shelby County  earthquake  34  which occurred on March 9  1937  It was centered in western Ohio  and had a magnitude of 5 4  and was of intensity VIII  35  Other significant earthquakes in Ohio include  36  one of magnitude 4 8 near Lima on September 19  1884  37  one of magnitude 4 2 near Portsmouth on May 17  1901  38  and one of 5 0 in LeRoy Township in Lake County on January 31  1986  which continued to trigger 13 aftershocks of magnitude 0 5 to 2 4 for two months  39  40  The most recent earthquake in Ohio of any appreciable magnitude occurred on December 31  2011  at 3 05pm EST  It had a magnitude of 4 0  and its epicenter was located approximately 4 kilometres northwest of Youngstown  41 7 19 1994 N 80 41 2 3994 W     41 121999833 N 80 683999833 W    41 121999833   80

History Main article  History of Ohio Native Americans Archeological evidence suggests that the Ohio Valley was inhabited by nomadic people as early as 13 000 BC  46  These early nomads disappeared from Ohio by 1 000 BC   but their material culture provided a base for those who followed them   46  Between 1 000 and 800 BC  the sedentary Adena culture emerged  As Ohio historian George W  Knepper notes  this sophisticated culture was  so named because evidences of their culture were excavated in 1902 on the grounds of Adena  Thomas Worthington s estate located near Chillicothe   47  The Adena were able to establish  semi permanent  villages because they domesticated plants  which included squash  sunflowers  and perhaps corn  Cultivation of these in addition to hunting and gathering supported more settled  complex villages  47  The most spectacular remnant of the Adena culture is the Great Serpent Mound  located in Adams County  Ohio  47  Around 100 BC  the Adena were joined in Ohio Country by the Hopewell people  who were named for the farm owned by Captain M  C  Hopewell  where evidence of their unique culture was discovered  48  Like the Adena  the Hopewell people participated in a mound building culture  Their complex  large and technologically sophisticated earthworks can be found in modern day Marietta  Newark  and Circleville  48  The Hopewell  however  disappeared from the Ohio Valley in about 600 AD  Little is known about the people who replaced them  49  Researchers have identified two additional  distinct prehistoric cultures  the Fort Ancient people and the Whittlesey Focus people  49  Both cultures apparently disappeared in the 17th century  perhaps decimated by infectious diseases spread in epidemics from early European contact  The Native Americans had no immunity to common European diseases  Some scholars believe that the Fort Ancient people  were ancestors of the historic Shawnee people  or that  at the very least  the historic Shawnees absorbed remnants of these older peoples   49  American Indians in the Ohio Valley were greatly affected by the aggressive tactics of the Iroquois Confederation  based in central and western New York  50  After the so called Beaver Wars in the mid 17th century  the Iroquois claimed much of the Ohio country as hunting and  more importantly  beaver trapping ground  After the devastation of epidemics and war in the mid 17th century  which largely emptied the Ohio country of indigenous people by the mid to late 17th century  the land gradually became repopulated by the mostly Algonquian speaking descendants of its ancient inhabitants  that is  descendants of the Adena  Hopewell  and Mississippian cultures  Many of these Ohio country nations were multi ethnic  sometimes multi linguistic  societies born out of the earlier devastation brought about by disease  war  and subsequent social instability  They subsisted on agriculture  corn  sunflowers  beans  etc   supplemented by seasonal hunts  By the 18th century  they were part of a larger global economy brought about by European entry into the fur trade  51  The indigenous nations to inhabit Ohio in the historical period included the Miamis  a large confederation   Wyandots  made up of refugees  especially from the fractured Huron confederacy   Delawares  pushed west from their historic homeland in New Jersey   Shawnees  also pushed west  although they may have been descended from the Fort Ancient people of Ohio   Ottawas  more commonly associated with the upper Great Lakes region   Mingos  like the Wyandot  a group recently formed of refugees from Iroquois   and Eries  gradually absorbed into the new  multi ethnic  republics   namely the Wyandot   52 Ohio country was also the site of Indian massacres  such as the Yellow Creek Massacre  Gnadenhutten and Pontiac s Rebellion school massacre  53  Colonial and Revolutionary eras During the 18th century  the French set up a system of trading posts to control the fur trade in the region  In 1754  France and Great Britain fought a war that was known in North America as the French and Indian War and in Europe as the Seven Years War  As a result of the Treaty of Paris  the French ceded control of Ohio and the remainder of the Old Northwest to Great Britain  Pontiac s Rebellion in the 1760s  however  posed a challenge to British military control  54  This came to an end with the colonists  victory in the American Revolution  In the Treaty of Paris in 1783  Britain ceded all claims to Ohio country to the United States  Northwest Territory  1787 1803 Plaque commemorating the Northwest Ordinance outside Federal Hall in lower Manhattan The United States created the Northwest Territory under the Northwest Ordinance of 1787  55  Slavery was not permitted in the new territory  Settlement began with the founding of Marietta by the Ohio Company of Associates  which had been formed by a group of American Revolutionary War veterans  Following the Ohio Company  the Miami Company  also referred to as the  Symmes Purchase   claimed the southwestern section  and the Connecticut Land Company surveyed and settled the Connecticut Western Reserve in present day Northeast Ohio  The old Northwest Territory originally included areas previously known as Ohio Country and Illinois Country  As Ohio prepared for statehood  the Indiana Territory was created  reducing the Northwest Territory to approximately the size of present day Ohio plus the eastern half of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan and the eastern tip of the Upper Peninsula  Under the Northwest Ordinance  areas of the territory could be defined and admitted as states once their population reached 60 000  Although Ohio s population numbered only 45 000 in December 1801  Congress determined that the population was growing rapidly and Ohio could begin the path to statehood  The assumption was that it would exceed 60 000 residents by the time it was admitted as a state  Statehood  1803 present On February 19  1803  President Jefferson signed an act of Congress that approved Ohio s boundaries and constitution  However  Congress had never passed a resolution formally admitting Ohio as the 17th state  The current custom of Congress declaring an official date of statehood did not begin until 1812  with Louisiana s admission as the 18th state  Although no formal resolution of admission was required  when the oversight was discovered in 1953  Ohio congressman George H  Bender introduced a bill in Congress to admit Ohio to the Union retroactive to March 1  1803  At a special session at the old state capital in Chillicothe  the Ohio state legislature approved a new petition for statehood that was delivered to Washington  D C  on horseback  On August 7  1953  the year of Ohio s 150th anniversary   President Eisenhower signed an act that officially declared March 1  1803 the date of Ohio s admittance into the Union  56  57  Although many Native Americans had migrated west to evade American encroachment  others remained settled in the state  sometimes assimilating in part  In 1830 under President Andrew Jackson  the US government forced Indian Removal of most tribes to the Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River  In 1835  Ohio fought with Michigan in the Toledo War  a mostly bloodless boundary war over the Toledo Strip  Congress intervened  making Michigan s admittance as a state conditional on ending the conflict  In exchange for giving up its claim to the Toledo Strip  Michigan was given the western two thirds of the Upper Peninsula  in addition to the eastern third that was already considered part of the state  Ohio state welcome sign  in an older  1990s  style Ohio s central position and its population gave it an important place during the Civil War  The Ohio River was a vital artery for troop and supply movements  as were Ohio s railroads  Ohio contributed more soldiers per capita than any other state in the Union  In 1862  the state s morale was badly shaken in the aftermath of the battle of Shiloh  a costly victory in which Ohio forces suffered 2 000 casualties  58  Later that year  when Confederate troops under the leadership of Stonewall Jackson threatened Washington  D C   Ohio governor David Tod still could recruit 5 000 volunteers to provide three months of service  59  Ohio historian Andrew R  L  Cayton writes that almost 35 000 Ohioans died in the conflict   and some thirty thousand carried battle scars with them for the rest of their lives   60  By the end of the Civil War  the Union s top three generals Ulysses S  Grant  William Tecumseh Sherman  and Philip Sheridan were all from Ohio  61  62  In 1912 a Constitutional Convention was held with Charles B  Galbreath as secretary  The result reflected the concerns of the Progressive Era  It introduced the initiative and the referendum  In addition  it allowed the General Assembly to put questions on the ballot for the people to ratify laws and constitutional amendments originating in the Legislature  Under the Jeffersonian principle that laws should be reviewed once a generation  the constitution provided for a recurring question to appear on Ohio s general election ballots every 20 years  The question asks whether a new convention is required  Although the question has appeared in 1932  1952  1972  and 1992  it has never been approved  Instead constitutional amendments have been proposed by petition to the legislature hundreds of times and adopted in a majority of cases  Eight U S  presidents hailed from Ohio at the time of their elections  giving rise to its nickname  Mother of Presidents   a sobriquet it shares with Virginia  It is also termed  Modern Mother of Presidents   63  in contrast to Virginia s status as the origin of presidents earlier in American history  Seven presidents were born in Ohio  making it second to Virginia s eight  Virginia born William Henry Harrison lived most of his life in Ohio and is also buried there  Harrison conducted his political career while living on the family compound  founded by his father in law  John Cleves Symmes  in North Bend  Ohio  The seven presidents born in Ohio were Ulysses S  Grant  Rutherford B  Hayes  James A  Garfield  Benjamin Harrison  grandson of William Henry Harrison   William McKinley  William
