firm now known as Kraft Foods has its origin as National Dairy Products Corporation  formed on December 10  1923 by Thomas H  McInnerney  11  The firm was initially set up to execute on a rollup strategy in the then fragmented United States ice cream industry  Through acquisitions it expanded into a full range of dairy products  By 1930  eight years after it was founded  it was the largest dairy company in the United States and the world  exceeding Borden  McInnerney operated the Hydrox Corporation  an ice cream company located in Chicago  Illinois  In 1923 he went to Wall Street to convince investment bankers there to finance his scheme for consolidating the United States ice cream industry  He initially found  hard sledding  with one banker saying the dairy industry  lacked dignity   He persevered and convinced a consortium including Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers to finance a roll up strategy  12  As a result of his efforts  National Dairy Products Corporation was formed in 1923 in a merger of McInnerney s Hydrox with Rieck McJunkin Dairy Co of Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  The resulting firm was then listed on the New York Stock Exchange with the offer of 125 000 shares having been oversubscribed  11  The firm grew quickly through a large number of acquisitions  As is typical in a roll up strategy  acquisitions were primarily for stock in National rather than cash  Examples of firms acquired include   list is not complete   National acquired more than 55 firms between 1923 and 1931  Year Firm Sector Location 1924 W E  Hoffman Ice cream Pennsylvania 1924

Consolidated Dairy Products Ice cream  other dairy New York  New Jersey  edit  Beginnings for Kraft The old Kraft logo  still used today on Kraft branded products Canadian born and of German origin  James L  Kraft started a wholesale door to door cheese business in Chicago in 1903  its first year of operations was  dismal   losing US 3 000 and a horse  However  the business took hold and Kraft was joined by his four brothers to form J L  Kraft and Bros  Company in 1909  As early as 1911  circulars and advertisements were in use by the company  In 1912  the company established its New York City  New York  headquarters to prepare for its international expansion  By 1914  thirty one varieties of cheeses were being sold around the U S  because of heavy product development  expansion by marketing  and opening a wholly owned cheese factory in Illinois  13  In 1915  the company had invented pasteurized processed cheese that did not need refrigeration  thus giving a longer shelf life than conventional cheese  13  The process was patented in 1916 and about six million pounds of the product were sold to the U S  Army for military rations during World War I  In 1916  the company began national advertising and had made its first acquisition   a Canadian cheese company  13  In 1924  the company changed its name to Kraft Cheese Company and listed on the Chicago Stock Exchange  13  In 1926  it was listed on the NYSE  The firm then began to consolidate the United States dairy industry through acquisition  in competition with National and Borden  Firms acquired included  Year

Hamburg  Germany  sales offices   its first forays outside North America  Sales for 1927 were  60 4m  In 1928  it acquired Phenix Cheese Company  the maker of a cream cheese branded as Philadelphia cream cheese  and the company changed its name to Kraft Phenix Cheese Company  In 1929  The New York Times reported that Kraft Phenix  The Hershey Company and Colgate were looking at merging  14  In the same year  it was reported that National  Borden and Standard Brands  a firm that is now part of Kraft Foods  were all looking at acquiring the firm  By 1930  it had captured forty percent of the cheese market in the U S  and was the third largest dairy company in the United States after National Dairy and Borden  In 1930  the company also began operating in Australia following a merger with Fred Walker  amp  Co  13   edit  Post National acquisition of Kraft Phenix At the time of the acquisition  National Dairy had sales of  315m compared with  85m for Kraft Phenix  National Dairy management ran the combined business  Following the Kraft Phenix acquisition  the firm continued to be called National Dairy until 1969 when it changed its name to Kraftco  15  Historically  all of the firm s sales came from dairy products  However  the firm s product lines began to diversify away from dairy products to caramel candies  macaroni and cheese dinners and margarines  From the 1950s onward  the firm began to move away from low value added commodity dairy products  such as fluid milk  16  This trend would continue for the firm  through neglect and divestiture  until the primary remaining dairy product produced by the firm would be cheese  As a result  the modern history of the firm emphasizes the cheese history  In 1933  the company began marketing by radio sponsorship  In 1935  the Sealtest brand of ice cream was launched as a unified national brand to replace the firm s numerous regional brands  17  During World War II  the company sent four million pounds of cheese to Britain weekly  17  Product development and advertising helped the company to grow during the postwar years  launching sliced process cheese and Cheez Whiz  a brand of process cheese sauce  in the 1950s  During these years  Thomas McInnerney  National Dairy s founder  and James L  Kraft  Kraft s founder  died  and at the end of the decade  the divisions became less autonomous and even diversified to the glass packaging business with the acquisition of Metro Glass in 1956  17  In 1947  the company tested the marketing power of the emerging medium of television by producing an hour long drama anthology series  the Kraft Television Theatre  The product advertised on the program  MacLaren s Imperial Cheese  was selected because       it had  not only had no advertising appropriation whatsoever  but had not even been distributed for several years   As described by internal documents of J  Walter Thompson   the advertising firm which conceived of the marketing test   the result was  although there was no other advertising support for it whatsoever  still grocery stores could not keep up with the demand   18  In the 1960s  product development became intense  launching fruit jellies  fruit preserves  marshmallows  barbecue sauces and Kraft Singles  a brand of individually wrapped cheese slices  17  During this decade  the company also expanded in many markets worldwide  In 1961  the firm acquired Dominion Dairies of Canada  marking the first effort by the firm to expand into fluid milk and ice cream outside the United States  19  In the same year it also acquired The Southern Oil Company in Manchester  England   edit  National Dairy becomes Kraft In 1969  the firm changed its name from National Dairy to Kraftco Corporation  The reason for the name change was given at the time   Expansion and innovation have taken us far afield from the regional milk and ice cream business we started with in 1923  Dollar sales of these original products have remained relatively static over the past ten years and  in 1969 accounted for approximately 25  of our sales   20  At the same time  the firm transferred to Glenview  Illinois  in 1972  13  In 1976  its name changed to Kraft  Inc  to emphasize the trademark the company had been known for and as a result of the fact that dairy  other than cheese  was now only a minor part of the company s sales  Reorganization also occurred after the name change  13   edit  Dart merger In 1980  Kraft merged with Dart Industries   makers of the Duracell brand of batteries  Tupperware brand of plastic containers  West Bend brand of home appliances  Wilsonart brand of plastics and Thatcher glass   to form Dart  amp  Kraft  13  During the 1980s  Dart  amp  Kraft offered mixed results to its shareholders  as new acquisitions in the food business   such as Churny premium cheeses  Lender s Bagels  Frusen Gladje ice cream and Celestial Seasonings tea   slightly offset the lagging nonfood business   Tupperware s decrease in sales and KitchenAid s  acquired soon after the merger  slide in market share   leading Dart  amp  Kraft to spin off its nonfood business  except Duracell batteries  into a new entity  Premark International  Inc   while changing its name back to Kraft  Inc  Premark was bought by Illinois Tool Works in 1999  In 1988  Kraft sold Duracell to private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  who then put it into an initial public offering in 1989  Gillette 13  bought Duracell in 1996  and itself was acquired by Procter and Gamble in 2005   edit  Philip Morris acquisition and merger with General Foods The Kraft Foods factory in Banbury s Ruscote estate  It has been a major employer in the town since 1965  21  At the end of 1988  Philip Morris Companies purchased Kraft for  12 9 billion  In 1989  Kraft merged with Philip Morris s General Foods unit   makers of Oscar Mayer meats  Maxwell House coffee  Jell O gelatin  Budget Gourmet frozen dinners  Entenmann s baked goods  Kool Aid  Crystal Light and Tang powdered beverage mixes  Post Cereals  Shake  n Bake flavored coatings and numerous other packaged foods   as Kraft General Foods  Its aggressive product development was reversed after the merger  as it became slow in addressing issues on its product lines due to its size  and also company politics  13  In 1990  the company acquired Jacobs Suchard  a European coffee and confectionery giant  and Freia Marabou  a Scandinavian confectionery maker  to expand overseas as its business was heavily dependent on the U S  In 1993  it acquired RJR Nabisco s cold cereal business  mainly Shredded Wheat and Shreddies cereals  while selling its Breyers ice cream division to Unilever and its Birds Eye unit to Dean Foods  In 1994  it sold its frozen dinners unit to H J  Heinz and in 1995  it sold its foodservice unit  13  In 1995  it changed its name to the present name  Kraft Foods  The same year  it sold its bakery division  except Lender s Bagels  which was sold in 1996 to CPC International   its candy division and its tablespreads division  Log Cabin syrup was sold in 1997  13   edit  Financial expansion In 2000  Philip Morris  renamed Altria in 2003  acquired Nabisco Holdings for  18 9 billion and merged the company with Kraft Foods the same year  13  In 2001  Philip Morris sold 280 million Kraft shares via the third largest IPO of all time  retaining an 88 1  stake in the company  In 2004  it sold its sugar confectionery division to Wrigley  while doing minor divestitures   including its hot cereals division  Cream of Wheat  in 2007  its pet snacks division  Milk Bone  in 2006  juice drinks and Fruit2o in 2007 and some grocery brands in 2006  clarification needed  Altria announced on January 31  2007  that it would spin off all the remaining Kraft Foods shares to Altria s shareholders  each will be given approximately 0 7 share of Kraft for every Altria share they owned  Investor Nelson Peltz bought a three percent stake at Kraft Foods and was talking with the executives on revitalizing the business  22  with options such as buying Wendy s fast food chain or selling off Post cereals and Maxwell House coffee  22  On January 31  2007  after months of speculation  the company announced that its 88 1  stake would be spun off to Altria shareholders at the end of March 2007  Kraft became an independent publicly held company  In July 2007  the company bought Groupe Danone s biscuit  cookie  and cereal division for  7 2 billion  including iconic French biscuit brand Lef vre Utile  22  23  While two years earlier firestorms of protest had arisen over plans for American PepsiCo s hostile takeover of the French company  Kraft s announcement was not met with the same protests  in part because Kraft agreed not to close French factories and keep the new merged divisions headquarters near Paris for at least three years  22  In November 2007  Kraft agreed to sell its cereal unit to Ralcorp Holdings  a major private label food maker  for  2 6 billion in a form of a spin off merger  This would add 50  to Ralcorp s sales  to  3 3 billion  and will be used for Kraft s debt payment  which was at  13 4 billion  in danger of a downgrade by Standard and Poor s  24  clarification needed  In February 2008  Berkshire Hathaway run by billionaire investor Warren E  Buffett announced that it had acquired an 8  stake in Kraft then worth over  4 billion  Buffett s business partner Charles Munger had also invested over  300 million in Kraft  Berkshire Hathaway owned 5 6  of the outstanding stock of Kraft Foods  as reported in the holding company s 2010 annual report  25  On September 22  2008  the company replaced the troubled insurance company  American International Group in the Dow Jones Industrial Average  7   edit  Purchase of Cadbury On September 7  2009  Kraft made a  10 2 billion takeover offer for the long established British confectionery group Cadbury  makers of Dairy Milk and Bournville chocolate  26  On November 9  2009 Kraft s  9 8bn takeover bid was rejected by Cadbury  Cadbury stated that the takeover bid was a  derisory  offer  27  Kraft renewed the offer under the same terms on December 4  2009  28  The offer generated significant political and public opposition in the United Kingdom and abroad  even leading to calls for the government to implement a policy of economic protectionism in cases of takeovers of large companies  29  On January 19  2010  Cadbury finally approved a revised offer from Kraft  valuing the confectionery business at  19 5 billion   11 5 billion   The funding for the takeover was partially provided by the Royal Bank of Scotland  the British part state owned bank  30  The Cadbury purchase was part of the long term strategy of Irene Rosenfeld  CEO and Kraft Chairman since March 2007  who developed a three year turnaround plan designed to drive the profitable growth of Kraft Foods  31  Known as a driven and decisive leader  she wanted to develop new markets and expand product range when assumed the role of chairman  The acquisition made sense and fit under Kraft s overall strategy at the time  It was assumed that it would help Kraft products develop in new markets such as Brazil and India because of Cadbury s current strong presence in those markets  32  India is one of its most resilient markets with sales growth of 20  and profits growing at 30  in a competitive market  33  Kraft believed the Cadbury purchase was also necessary because of the likelihood of Nestle and Hershey joining together  citation needed  Kraft also believed it could squeeze savings of at least  675m annually by the end of the third year  34  Irene Rosenfeld saw the Kraft Cadbury merger as the  logical next step in our transformation toward a high growth  higher margin company   She also justified the merger in order to build a  global powerhouse in snacks  confectionery and quick meals   35  Following the purchase of Cadbury  Kraft commanded 14 8  of the global candy and gum market  Kraft argued that it could take advantage of the Cadbury distribution in developing markets of India  Brazil and Mexico  36  As incomes rise in these developing nations  Kraft hopes that products such as Oreo will become impulse buys for children  36 Mars  Inc  is second in the confectionery market with 14 6  share  followed by Nestle with 7 8   37  At the time of the purchase  the chocolate and sugar industry had been growing rapidly at 15  over the previous three years and was valued at  113 billion  38  The purchase of Cadbury was considered strange because they did not have a strong foothold on the confectionery market  but at the time Kraft noted their production of confectionery foods like Toblerone and candy foods like Oreo  Cadbury also owned popular gum brands such as Stride  Trident  Dentyne  and Chiclets  39 Roger Carr  chairman of Cadbury  discussed his approval of the takeover by Kraft by saying   We believe the offer represents good value for Cadbury shareholders and are pleased with the commitment that Kraft Foods has made to our heritage  values and people throughout the world   40   edit  Acquisition fallout Cadbury sales were flat after Kraft s acquisition  Despite the Cadbury takeover helping to boost sales by 30   Kraft s net profit for the fourth quarter fell 24  to  540m due to costs associated with integrating the UK business after the acquisition  41  Kraft suffered from  1 3billion of implementation costs to achieve just  675 million in cost synergies by the end of 2012  estimated   42  Kraft was forced to increase prices to offset rising commodity costs in North America and Europe  Kraft has had to contend with the higher cost of ingredients such as corn  sugar and cocoa  Kraft chief executive Irene Rosenfeld said   We expect it will remain weak for the foreseeable future   Taking into account integration costs  the acquisition knocked about 33  off Kraft s earnings per share immediately after the purchase of Cadbury  41  In March 2011  Kraft caused local outrage when they sold the site of an historic Cadbury factory it vowed not to close for  50million  The Somerdale Factory was closed just days after the takeover by Kraft Foods  Former Cadbury workers demanded an apology for the abrupt selling of the plant  but Kraft s CEO Irene Rosenfeld refused to explain her actions   43  Kraft continues to use Cadbury brands in emerging markets to expand all of its products  In April 2011  Kraft set to invest  150 million in South Africa s manufacturing plants over three years  President Sanjay Khosla said   South Africa is a priority market for us  where we focus on power brands like Cadbury chocolate   44   edit  Sale of Frozen Pizza Division to Nestl  On March 1  2010  Nestle concluded the purchase of Kraft s North American frozen pizza business for  3 7 billion  Kraft left the door open to repurchase with a buyback option not before one year and not after three years for the original sale price of  3 7 billion  Although not likely if Kraft were to want to repurchase they would have to come up with cash only and no stocks  The sale included DiGiorno  Tombstone and Jack s brands in the United States  the Delissio brand in Canada and the California Pizza Kitchen trademark license  It also includes two Wisconsin manufacturing facilities in Medford and Little Chute  The business generated 2009 net revenues of  1 6 billion  with 3 400 employees  45   edit  Proposed split After a period of poor share performance and investor criticism  Rosenfeld was forced to announce in 2011 the proposed split of the company into two new entities  Both listed on the New York Stock Exchange  the first would retain the Kraft foods names and brands  and focus on the North American foods business  The second  later proposed to be named Mondelez International  would focus on the global snacks business  and would include the former Cadbury businesses  plus global brands including Dairylea and Philadelphia  46   edit  Sponsorships Kraft is an official partner and sponsor of Major League Soccer and sponsors the Kraft Nabisco
