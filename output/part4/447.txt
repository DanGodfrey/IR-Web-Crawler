Knight finally defeats Bushman by carving off his face with a crescent moon dart  The series highlights Spector s supposed spiritual connection to the moon god as well as his own psychologically damaged state of mind  After returning to his role as Moon Knight  Spector continually receives guidance by what he believes to be Khonshu in the form of a faceless Bushman  This storyline also

applies for registration after much prodding from Khonshu  not wanting the law to keep him from his work  The law requires him to submit to a psychiatric exam  The psychiatrist controlling the exam  along with the government and Tony Stark  have no intention of granting Marc Spector approval for registration  After speaking with Spector s repressed alter egos Jake Lockley and Steven Grant  the psychiatrist begins the process of officially turning him down  suggesting possible future imprisonment  Spector breaks the doctor s will by speaking in the voice of Khonshu and pointing out the doctor s own antisocial tendencies  told to him by the Profile  The psychiatrist not only approves his application  but bows to worship him as well  However  later on  Marc meets the Profile with their dialogue suggesting that the personalities above were just an act to be approved for registration  39  In the subsequent arc   God and Country   writer Mike Benson and artist Mark Texeira take over the series  with Charlie Huston still co plotting  This arc centers itself on Moon Knight s ability  or lack thereof  as a  registered hero  and Marc Spector s ability  or lack thereof  to hold

the people of New York begin to see him as a hero and not a murderous vigilante much to Norman Osborn s disdain  Jake s personality has been one of struggle against the inner demon trying to get him

launch of Moon Knight  attempted to answer the criticism that Moon Knight is an ersatz Batman in an interview with Comixfan  50  The interviewer noted that the comparison is not baseless  as both Moon Knight and the Dark Knight are wealthy   normal  humans that use gadgetry to fight crime  Huston accepted that the two characters had their similarities  but went on to contrast the two by noting in particular differences in origin  motives  and personality   Bruce Wayne   he said   fights crime to avenge the murders of his parents   whereas Moon Knight  beats up whoever has it coming because he believes he is the avatar of the Egyptian god of vengeance and it helps him to feel better about all the people he killed when he was a mercenary   Thus  while Batman is motivated by vengeance for wrong done to his parents  Marc Spector is motivated by vengeance as a concept  Huston further notes that Bruce Wayne  Batman s alter ego  takes on other personalities merely to aid in his fight  However  Moon Knight has three alter egos which aid him as much in dealing with personal demons as fighting law breakers  and which have taken a further psychological toll of causing dissociative identity disorder  In the question of his sanity  Spider Man remarked  Moony  Rhymes with looney    edit  Powers and abilities Over the course of his life as a boxer  U S  Marine  C I A  operative  mercenary  and costumed superhero  Marc Spector has become an expert at commando hand to hand combat techniques and various martial arts  He is an Olympic level athlete and a skilled acrobat and gymnast  and excels as a combat strategist  He employs a variety of weapons over the course of his career  including throwing darts  nunchaku  and a truncheon  He is skilled with most weapons  and an expert with throwing weapons  He is a superb driver and can pilot a helicopter  Taskmaster  who has the ability to copy and replicate anyone s fighting style  has stated that he prefers not to copy Moon Knight s style  as Moon Knight would rather take a punch than block it  After his first appearance  but before the beginning of his first ongoing series  Moon Knight is said to have superhuman strength derived from the bite of a werewolf interacting with the silver in his armor  although characters in the story express some disbelief at this story   He is said to be as strong as ten men under the full moon  though his strength is normal under a new moon or an eclipse  Promotional art of Moon Knight descending from the Mooncopter  Art by David Finch  Spector gained his superhuman powers as a result of a visitation by the Egyptian moon god Khonshu  Moon Knight s strength  endurance  and reflexes are enhanced depending upon the phases of the moon  51  The fuller the moon  the more strength Moon Knight derives from it  though even during a new moon  he can lift several hundred pounds  He has some degree of superhuman strength during the peak of a lunar cycle  It s not known how much of this strength is mystical and how much is simply the result of self hypnosis due to his psychological instability  Due to his multiple personalities  he is also resistant to some psychic attacks and sometimes receives prophetic visions  During the 2008 run of the Moon Knight series Spector states that he no longer has any superpowers  At one point  Moon Knight is given special weapons by the cult of Khonshu  including bolas  golden throwing crescent darts shaped like scarabs  an ivory boomerang  throwing irons  and a golden club in the shape of an ankh that glowed in the presence of danger that can be used as a throwing weapon or bludgeon  These items are replaced with duplicate weapons crafted by Hawkeye  He later retires these items to his personal museum after abandoning the  Egyptian  motif in favor of updated versions of his original styled gear  including a truncheon staff nunchucks combo  and a compound bow  He has also used an axe shaped lasso grapple  During the third series  Moon Knight s silver white costume includes adamantium  and he acquires an array of high tech weaponry including an adamantium staff  a truncheon capable of firing a cable line  and gauntlets that fire crescent darts  He has also been depicted using spiked knuckles  worn on the left hand  Later on  Moon Knight s costume uses carbonadium as armor  and has joint locking functions  allowing him to support weights far greater than what he can normally lift  volume  amp  issue needed  Moon Knight makes use of this at one point to leave his costume supporting a building while defending himself in his underwear  Additionally  Moon Knight can  suit up  by use of a remote control device which assembles the individual pieces of his armor onto his body  similar in fashion to Iron Man  52  For transportation  Moon Knight employs a variety of sophisticated aircraft  These include the Mooncopter and Angelwing  featuring VTOL  vertical take off and landing   a rope ladder  and 20 mm cannons   edit  Enemies While Moon Knight fights villains such as Bullseye and Taskmaster which are enemies of other heroes as well  he has also accumulated his own rogues gallery  Villains include  Black Spectre Bluebeard Bora Raoul Bushman The Committee Midnight Man Morpheus The Profile Shadow Knight Stained Glass Scarlet The Werewolf  edit  Reception Moon Knight was ranked by Wizard magazine as the 149th greatest comic book character of all time  53 IGN also listed Moon Knight as the 89th greatest comic book character stating that the Moon Knight is more or less the concept of what would happen if the Batman would suffer a multiple personality disorder  54   edit  Other versions  edit  2099 The one shot 2099  Manifest Destiny  March 1998  introduced a female Marvel 2099

Resistance against Earth s rulers  the House of Magnus  Magneto and his children  Quicksilver  Polaris  and the Scarlet Witch   although he is not wearing his costume in this timeline  He also appears

Bagley  A former Navy SEAL  Ultimate Moon Knight is the product of a Super Soldier experiment gone wrong  Prior to becoming Moon Knight  he worked for the Roxxon Corporation as Paladin  It is also noted that he has a form of dissociative identity disorder  Within the comic  the  personalities  of Steven Grant  Marc Spector  Moon Knight  an unnamed red headed little girl  and Ronin interact through internal monologue  He lives with his girlfriend Marlene  She displays knowledge of his Moon Knight identity  Ultimate Moon Knight first appears in Ultimate Spider Man  79 during the Warriors story arc  He is an active participant of a gang war waged by the Kingpin and newcomer Hammerhead  During the battle  he is impaled by the assassin Elektra  Although gravely wounded  Moon Knight subdues Elektra with a moon blade to her head before slipping into a coma  Upon waking up  Moon Knight escapes from custody and engages in a fight with the Punisher  Spider Man  and Daredevil  After the battle  Daredevil invites Moon Knight to join an organization of superheroes with the goal of bringing down the Kingpin  As part of this group  Spector adopts the identity of Ronin to infiltrate the Kingpin s ranks  The idea of turning  Ronin  into the main persona is made by the Steven Grant and Marc Spector personalities  who oppose the Moon Knight persona and the concerns of the small girl persona  In doing so  they create a far more ruthless personality who the Kingpin would find suitable  Moon Knight himself is angered by this decision  but is seemingly destroyed by the Ronin personality  The Kingpin discovers that Ronin is working for Daredevil and orders his execution  He survives  however  and after regaining consciousness goes to the police claiming that the Kingpin ordered his execution  This provides a charge for the police to arrest the Kingpin  but he has to reveal his secret identity for a charge to be placed  It also seems that the Moon Knight persona is still alive after the Ronin persona decides to wake him up   edit  Universe X In Universe X  Moon Knight is locked in a never ending battle with the Sons of Set  over the statue of Khonshu  It s
