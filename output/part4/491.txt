External links  edit  Early life Rand was born Alisa Zinov yevna Rosenbaum  Russian                              on February 2  1905  to a bourgeois family living in Saint Petersburg  She was the eldest of the three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum and Anna Borisovna Rosenbaum  largely non observant Jews  Rand s father was a successful pharmacist  eventually owning his own pharmacy and the building in which it was located  4  Rand was twelve at the time of the Russian Revolution of 1917  during which her sympathies were with Alexander Kerensky  Rand s family life was disrupted by the rise of the Bolshevik party under Vladimir Lenin  Her father s pharmacy was confiscated by the Bolsheviks  and the family fled to the Crimea  which was initially under the control of the White Army during the Russian Civil War  She later recalled that while in high school she determined that she was an atheist and that she valued reason above any other human attribute  After graduating from high school in the Crimea  at 16 Rand returned with her family to Petrograd  the new name for Saint Petersburg   where they faced desperate conditions  on occasion nearly starving  5  6  Rand completed a three year program at Petrograd State University  After the Russian Revolution  universities were opened to women  including Jews  allowing Rand to be in the first group of women to enroll at Petrograd State University  7  where she studied in the department of social pedagogy  majoring in history  8  At the university she was introduced to the writings of Aristotle and Plato  9  who would form two of her greatest influences and counter influences  respectively  10  A third figure whose philosophical works she studied heavily was Friedrich Nietzsche  11  Able to read French  German and Russian  Rand also discovered the writers Fyodor Dostoevsky  Victor Hugo  Edmond Rostand  and Friedrich Schiller  who became her perennial favorites  12  Along with many other  bourgeois  students  Rand was purged from the university shortly before graduating  However  after complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists  many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate  13  which Rand did in October 1924  14  She subsequently studied for a year at the State Technicum for Screen Arts in Leningrad  For one of her assignments  she wrote an essay about the actress Pola Negri  which became her first published work  15  By this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be Rand  16  possibly as a Cyrillic contraction of her birth surname  17  and she adopted the first name Ayn  either from a Finnish name or from the Hebrew word      ayin  meaning  eye    18  Cover of Rand s first published work  a 2 500 word monograph on the Polish femme fatale Pola Negri published in 1925  15  In the fall of 1925  Rand was granted a visa to visit American relatives  Rand was so impressed with the skyline of Manhattan upon her arrival in New York Harbor that she cried what she later called  tears of splendor   19  Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter  she lived for a few months with relatives in Chicago  one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films for free  She then set out for Hollywood  California  20  Initially  Rand struggled in Hollywood and took odd jobs to pay her basic living expenses  A chance meeting with famed director Cecil B  DeMille led to a job as an extra in his film  The King of Kings  and to subsequent work as a junior screenwriter  21  While working on The King of Kings  she met an aspiring young actor  Frank O Connor  the two were married on April 15  1929  Rand became an American citizen in 1931  Taking various jobs during the 1930s to support her writing  Rand worked for a time as the head of the costume department at RKO Studios  22  She made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the United States  but they were unable to acquire permission to emigrate  23   edit  Career  edit  Early fiction See also  Night of January 16th  We the Living  and Anthem  novella  Rand s first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay Red Pawn to Universal Studios in 1932  although it was never produced  24  This was followed by the courtroom drama Night of January 16th  first produced by E E  Clive in Hollywood in 1934 and then successfully reopened on Broadway in 1935  Each night the  jury  was selected from members of the audience  and one of the two different endings  depending on the jury s  verdict   would then be performed  25  In 1941  Paramount Pictures produced a movie version of the play  Rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result  26  Rand s first novel  the semi autobiographical We the Living  was published in 1936  Set in Soviet Russia  it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state  In a 1959 foreword to the novel  Rand stated that We the Living  is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write  It is not an autobiography in the literal  but only in the intellectual sense  The plot is invented  the background is not     27  Initial sales were slow and the American publisher let it go out of print  28  although European editions continued to sell  29  After the success of her later novels  Rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies  30  Without Rand s knowledge or permission  the novel was made into a pair of Italian films  Noi vivi and Addio  Kira  in 1942  Rediscovered in the 1960s  these films were re edited into a new version which was approved by Rand and re released as We the Living in 1986  31  Her novella Anthem was written during a break from the writing of her next major novel  The Fountainhead  It presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word  I  has been forgotten and replaced with  we   32  It was published in England in 1938  but Rand initially could not find an American publisher  As with We the Living  Rand s later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946  which has sold more than 3 5 million copies  33   edit  The Fountainhead and political activism See also  The Fountainhead and The Fountainhead  film  During the 1940s  Rand became politically active  Both she and her husband worked full time in volunteer positions for the 1940 Presidential campaign of Republican Wendell Willkie  This work led to Rand s first public speaking experiences  including fielding the sometimes hostile questions from New York City audiences who had just viewed pro Willkie newsreels  an experience she greatly enjoyed  34  This activity also brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free market capitalism  She became friends with journalist Henry Hazlitt and his wife  and Hazlitt introduced her to the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises  Despite her philosophical differences with them  Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career  and both of them expressed admiration for her  Once von Mises referred to Rand as  the most courageous man in America   a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said  man  instead of  woman   35  Rand also developed a friendship with libertarian writer Isabel Paterson  Rand questioned the well informed Paterson about American history and politics long into the night during their numerous meetings and gave Paterson ideas for her only nonfiction book  The God of the Machine  36  Rand s first major success as a writer came with The Fountainhead in 1943  a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years  37  The novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named Howard Roark and his struggle against what Rand described as  second handers  those who attempt to live through others  placing others above self  It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the Bobbs Merrill Company on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden  who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it  38  While completing the novel  Rand was prescribed the amphetamine Benzedrine to fight fatigue  39  The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the finished novel  but when the book was done  she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks  rest  40  Her continued use of the drug for a number of years may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings  41  The Fountainhead eventually became a worldwide success  bringing Rand fame and financial security  42  In 1943  Rand sold the rights for a film version to Warner Bros   and she returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay  Finishing her work on that screenplay  she was hired by producer Hal Wallis as a screenwriter and script doctor  Her work for Wallis included the screenplays for the Oscar nominated Love Letters and You Came Along  43  This role gave Rand time to work on other projects  including a planned nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called The Moral Basis of Individualism  Although the planned book was never completed  a condensed version was published as an essay titled  The Only Path to Tomorrow   in the January 1944 edition of Reader s Digest magazine  44  Wikisource has original text related to this article  Ayn Rand s testimony before the House of Representatives Committee on Un American Activities While working in Hollywood  Rand extended her involvement with free market and anti communist activism  She became involved with the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals  a Hollywood anti Communist group  and wrote articles on the group s behalf  She also joined the anti Communist American Writers Association  45  A visit by Isabel Paterson to meet with Rand s California associates led to a final falling out between the two when Paterson made comments that Rand saw as rude to valued political allies  46  In 1947  during the Second Red Scare  Rand testified as a  friendly witness  before the United States House Un American Activities Committee  Her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the Soviet Union and the portrayal of it in the 1944 film Song of Russia  47  Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union  portraying life there as being much better and happier than it actually was  48  When asked about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations after the hearings  Rand described the process as  futile   49  After several delays  the film version of The Fountainhead was released in 1949  Although it used Rand s screenplay with minimal alterations  she  disliked the movie from beginning to end   complaining about its editing  acting and other elements  50   edit  Atlas Shrugged and Objectivism See also  Atlas Shrugged  Objectivism  Ayn Rand   and Objectivist movement After the publication of The Fountainhead  Rand received numerous letters from readers  some of whom it had profoundly influenced  In 1951 Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City  where she gathered a group of these admirers around her  This group  jokingly designated  The Collective   included future Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan  a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal  later Nathaniel Branden  and his wife Barbara  and Barbara s cousin Leonard Peikoff  At first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy  Later she began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel  Atlas Shrugged  as the manuscript pages were written  In 1954 Rand s close relationship with the much younger Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair  with the consent of their spouses  51  Atlas Shrugged  published in 1957  was Rand s magnum opus  52  Rand described the theme of the novel as  the role of the mind in man s existence and  as a corollary  the demonstration of a new moral philosophy  the morality of rational self interest   53  It advocates the core tenets of Rand s philosophy of Objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement  The plot involves a dystopian United States in which the most creative industrialists  scientists and artists go on strike and retreat to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy  The novel s hero and leader of the strike  John Galt  describes the strike as  stopping the motor of the world  by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nation s wealth and achievement  With this fictional strike  Rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive  the economy would collapse and society would fall apart  The novel includes elements of mystery and science fiction  54  and it contains Rand s most extensive statement of Objectivism in any of her works of fiction  a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt  Atlas Shrugged became an international bestseller  and in an interview with Mike Wallace  Rand declared herself  the most creative thinker alive   55 Atlas Shrugged was to be Rand s last work of fiction  a turning point in her life  it marked the end of Rand s career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher  56  After completing the novel of more than one thousand pages  however  Rand fell into a severe depression that may have been aggravated by her use of prescription amphetamines  57  In 1958 Nathaniel Branden established Nathaniel Branden Lectures  later incorporated as the Nathaniel Branden Institute  NBI   to promote Rand s philosophy  Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for Objectivist periodicals that she edited  Rand later published some of these articles in book form  Critics  including some former NBI students and Branden himself  have described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand  with some describing NBI or the entire Objectivist movement as a cult or religion  58  Rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics  including literature  music  sexuality  even facial hair  and some of her followers mimicked all her preferences  wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers  59  Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students 60  and held them to strict standards  sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her  61  However  some former NBI students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated  with the problem being concentrated among Rand s closest followers in New York  62   edit  Later years Throughout the 1960s and 1970s  Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as Yale University  Princeton University  Columbia University  63 Harvard University and MIT  64  She received an honorary doctorate from Lewis  amp  Clark College in 1963  65  She also began delivering annual lectures at the Ford Hall Forum  responding afterward to questions from the audience  66  During these speeches and Q amp A sessions  she often took controversial stances on political and social issues of the day  These included supporting abortion rights  67  opposing the Vietnam War and the military draft  but condemning many draft dodgers as  bums    68  supporting Israel in the Arab Israeli War of 1973 as  civilized men fighting savages   69  saying European colonists had the right to take land from American Indians  70  and calling homosexuality  immoral  and  disgusting   while also advocating the repeal of all laws against it  71  She also endorsed several Republican candidates for President of the United States  most strongly Barry Goldwater in 1964  whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for The Objectivist Newsletter  72  Grave marker for Rand and her husband at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla  New York In 1964 Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the young actress Patrecia Scott  whom he later married  Nathaniel and Barbara Branden kept the affair hidden from Rand  When she learned of it in 1968  though her romantic relationship with Branden had already ended  73  Rand terminated her relationship with both Brandens  which led to the closure of NBI  74  Rand published an article in The Objectivist repudiating Nathaniel Branden for dishonesty and other  irrational behavior in his private life   75  Branden later apologized in an interview to  every student of Objectivism  for  perpetuating the Ayn Rand mystique  and for  contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repressiveness that pervades the Objectivist movement   76  A heavy smoker  Rand underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974  77  78  Several more of her closest associates parted company with her 79  and during the late 1970s her activities within the Objectivist movement declined  especially after the death of her husband  on November 9  1979  80  One of her final projects was work on a never completed television adaptation of Atlas Shrugged  81  Rand died of heart failure on March 6  1982  at her home in New York City  82  and was interred in the Kensico Cemetery  Valhalla  New York  83  Rand s funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers  including Alan Greenspan  A six foot floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket  84  In her will  Rand named Leonard Peikoff the heir to her estate  85   edit  Philosophy Objectivist movement Philosophy ObjectivismRational egoismIndividualismCapitalismRomantic realism Organizations Ayn Rand InstituteAtlas

ObjectivismObjectivism and homosexualityObjectivist movement in IndiaRandian heroPhilosophical movement   Philosophy portal v t e Main article  Objectivism  Ayn Rand  Rand called her philosophy  Objectivism   describing its essence as  the concept of man as a heroic being  with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life  with productive achievement as his noblest activity  and reason as his only absolute   86  She considered Objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics  epistemology  ethics  political philosophy and esthetics  87  In metaphysics  Rand supported philosophical realism and atheism  and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism  including all forms of religion  88  In epistemology  she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception  the validity of which she considered axiomatic  89  and reason  which she described as  the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man s senses   90  She rejected all claims of non perceptual or a priori knowledge  including   instinct    intuition    revelation   or any form of  just knowing    91  In her Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology  Rand presented a theory of concept formation and endorsed the rejection of the analytic synthetic dichotomy  92  In ethics  Rand argued for rational egoism  rational self interest   as the guiding moral principle  She said the individual should  exist for his own sake  neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself   93  She referred to egoism as  the virtue of selfishness  in her book of that title  94  in which she presented her solution to the is ought problem by describing a meta ethical theory that based morality in the needs of  man s survival qua man   95  She condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness  96  and held that the initiation of force was evil and irrational  writing in Atlas Shrugged that  Force and mind are opposites   97  Rand s political philosophy emphasized individual rights  including property rights   98  and she considered laissez faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights  99  She opposed statism  which she understood to include theocracy  absolute monarchy  Nazism  fascism  communism  democratic socialism  and dictatorship  100  Rand believed that rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government  101  Although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian  she preferred the term  radical for capitalism   She worked with conservatives on political projects  but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics  102  She denounced libertarianism  which she associated with anarchism  103  She rejected anarchism as a na ve theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice  104  Rand s esthetics defined art as a  selective re creation of reality according to an artist s metaphysical value judgments   According to Rand  art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped  thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness  105  As a writer  the art form Rand focused on most closely was literature  where she considered Romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will  106  She described her own approach to literature as  romantic realism   107  Rand acknowledged Aristotle as her greatest influence 108  and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend  three A s  Aristotle  Aquinas  and Ayn Rand  109  She also found early inspiration in Friedrich Nietzsche  110  and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from Rand s journals  111  in passages from the first edition of We the Living  which Rand later revised   112  and in her overall writing style  113  However  by the time she wrote The Fountainhead  Rand had turned against Nietzsche s ideas  114  and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed  115  Among the philosophers Rand held in particular disdain was Immanuel Kant  whom she referred to as a  monster  and  the most evil man in history   116  although Objectivist philosophers George Walsh 117  and Fred Seddon 118  have argued that she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences  Rand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her  theory of concepts   her  ethics  and  her  discovery in politics that evil the violation of rights consists of the initiation of force   119  She believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy  120  stating   I am not primarily an advocate of capitalism  but of egoism  and I am not primarily an advocate of egoism  but of reason  If one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently  all the rest follows   121   edit  Reception and legacy  edit  Reviews During Rand s lifetime  her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation  Rand s first novel  We the Living  was admired by the literary critic H L  Mencken  122  her Broadway play Night of January 16th was both a critical and popular success  123  and The Fountainhead was hailed by a reviewer in The New York Times as  masterful   124  Rand s novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as being long and melodramatic  125  However  they became bestsellers largely through word of mouth  126  The first reviews Rand received were for Night of January 16th  Reviews of the production were largely positive  but Rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer  123  Rand believed that her first novel  We the Living  was not widely reviewed  but Rand scholar Michael S  Berliner says  it was the most reviewed of any of her works   with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications  Overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work  127  Her 1938 novella Anthem received little attention from reviewers  both for its first publication in England and for subsequent re issues  128  Rand s first bestseller  The Fountainhead  received far fewer reviews than We the Living  and reviewers  opinions were mixed  129  There was a positive review in The New York Times that Rand greatly appreciated  130  The reviewer called Rand  a writer of great power  who wrote  brilliantly  beautifully and bitterly   and stated that  you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time   124  There were other positive reviews  but Rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications  129  Some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel  125  such as one that called it  a whale of a book  and another that said  anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper rationing   Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rand s style  offensively pedestrian   129  Rand s 1957 novel Atlas Shrugged was widely reviewed  and many of the reviews were strongly negative  125  131  In the National Review  conservative author Whittaker Chambers called the book  sophomoric  and  remarkably silly   He described the tone of the book as  shrillness without reprieve  and accused Rand of supporting a Godless system  which he related to that of the Soviets   claiming  From almost any page of Atlas Shrugged  a voice can be heard  from painful necessity  commanding   To a gas chamber go    132 Atlas Shrugged received positive reviews from a few publications  including praise from the noted book reviewer John Chamberlain  131  but Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein later wrote that  reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put downs   calling it  execrable claptrap  and  a nightmare   they said it was  written out of hate  and showed  remorseless hectoring and prolixity   125  Author Flannery O Connor wrote in a letter to a friend that  The fiction of Ayn Rand is as low as you can get re fiction  I hope you picked it up off the floor of the subway and threw it in the nearest garbage pail   133  Rand s nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had  The tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book  For the New Intellectual  was similar to that for Atlas Shrugged  134  135  with philosopher Sidney Hook likening her certainty to  the way philosophy is written in the Soviet Union   136  and author Gore Vidal calling her viewpoint  nearly perfect in its immorality   137  Her subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers  134  On the 100th anniversary of Rand s birth in 2005  Edward Rothstein  writing for The New York Times  referred to her fictional writing as quaint utopian  retro fantasy  and programmatic neo Romanticism of the misunderstood artist  while criticizing her characters   isolated rejection of democratic society   138  In 2007  book critic Leslie Clark described her fiction as  romance novels with a patina of pseudo philosophy   139  In 2009  GQ s critic columnist Tom Carson described her books as  capitalism s version of middlebrow religious novels  such as Ben Hur and the Left Behind series  140   edit  Popular interest A quote from Rand s book The Fountainhead  on the wall directly across from the entrance to The American Adventure rotunda at Walt Disney World s Epcot In 1991  a survey conducted for the Library of Congress and the Book of the Month Club asked club members what the most influential book in the respondent s life was  Rand s Atlas Shrugged was the second most popular choice  after the Bible  141  Rand s books continue to be widely sold and read  with 25 million copies sold as of 2007 142  and another 800 000 sold in 2008   This includes approximately 300 000 copies distributed for free by the Ayn Rand Institute   143  Although Rand s influence has been greatest in the United States  there has been international interest in her work  144  Rand s contemporary admirers included fellow novelists  such as Ira Levin  Kay Nolte Smith and L  Neil Smith  and later writers such as Erika Holzer and Terry Goodkind have been influenced by her  145  Other artists who have cited Rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include comic book artist Steve Ditko 146  and musician Neil Peart of Rush  147  Rand provided a positive view of business  and in response business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work  148 John Allison of BB amp T and Ed Snider of Comcast Spectacor have funded the promotion of Rand s ideas  149  while Mark Cuban  owner of the Dallas Mavericks  and John P  Mackey  CEO of Whole Foods  among others  have said they consider Rand crucial to their success  150  Rand and her works have been referred to in a variety of media  References to her have appeared on television shows including animated sitcoms  live action comedies  dramas  and game shows  151  She  or characters based on her  figure prominently  in positive and negative lights  in literary and science fiction novels by prominent American authors  152 Nick Gillespie  editor in chief of Reason  has remarked that  Rand s is a tortured immortality  one in which she s as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist     and that  jibes at Rand as cold and inhuman  run through the popular culture   153  Two movies have been made about Rand s life  A 1997 documentary film  Ayn Rand  A Sense of Life  was nominated for the Academy Award for Documentary Feature  154 The Passion of Ayn Rand  a 1999 television adaptation of the book of the same name  won several awards  142  Rand s image also appears on a U S  postage stamp designed by artist Nick Gaetano  155   edit  Political influence

conservative  and  libertarian   156  Rand has had continuing influence on right wing politics and libertarianism  157 Jim Powell  a senior fellow at the Cato Institute  considers Rand one of the three most important women  along with Rose Wilder Lane and Isabel Paterson  of modern American libertarianism  158  and David Nolan  one of the founders of the Libertarian Party  stated that  without Ayn Rand  the libertarian movement would not exist   159  In his history of the libertarian movement  journalist Brian Doherty described her as  the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large   141  and biographer Jennifer Burns referred to her as  the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right   160  Despite Rand s untraditionally Republican stance as a pro choice atheist  161  the political figures who cite Rand as an influence are most often conservative or libertarian members of the United States Republican Party  162  A 1987 article in The New York Times referred to her as the Reagan administration s  novelist laureate   163  Republican Congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and recommended her novels  164  The late 2000s financial crisis spurred renewed interest in her works  especially Atlas Shrugged  which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis  165  and opinion articles compared real world events with the plot of the novel  166  During this time  signs mentioning Rand and her fictional hero John Galt appeared at Tea Party protests  167  There was also increased criticism of her ideas  especially from the political left  with critics blaming the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets  particularly through her influence on Alan Greenspan  168  For example  Mother Jones remarked that  Rand s particular genius has always been her ability to turn upside down traditional hierarchies and recast the wealthy  the talented  and the powerful as the oppressed   161  while The Nation alleged similarities between the  moral syntax of Randianism  and fascism  169   edit  Academic reaction During Rand s lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars  3  When the first academic book about Rand s philosophy appeared in 1971  its author declared writing about Rand  a treacherous undertaking  that could lead to  guilt by association  for taking her seriously  170  A few articles about Rand s ideas appeared in academic journals prior to her death in 1982  many of them in The Personalist  171  One of these was  On the Randian Argument  by respected libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick  who argued that her meta ethical argument is unsound and fails to solve the is ought problem posed by David Hume  172  Some responses to Nozick by other academic philosophers were also published in The Personalist arguing that Nozick misstated Rand s case  171  Academic consideration of Rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited  Gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about Rand s novels when she began researching her in 1973  and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s  173  Since Rand s death in 1982  interest in her work has gradually increased  174  Historian Jennifer Burns has identified  three overlapping waves  of scholarly interest in Rand  the most recent of which is  an explosion of scholarship  since the year 2000  175  However  few universities currently include Rand or Objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area  with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study  176  Academics Mimi Gladstein  Chris Sciabarra  Allan Gotthelf  Edwin A  Locke and Tara Smith have taught her work in academic institutions  Sciabarra co edits the Journal of Ayn Rand Studies  a nonpartisan peer reviewed journal dedicated to the study of Rand s philosophical and literary work  177  In 1987 Gotthelf helped found the Ayn Rand Society  and has been active in sponsoring seminars about Rand and her ideas  178  Smith has written several academic books and papers on Rand s ideas  including Ayn Rand s Normative Ethics  The Virtuous Egoist  a volume on Rand s ethical theory published by Cambridge University Press  Rand s ideas have also been made subjects of study at Clemson and Duke universities  179  Scholars of English and American literature have largely ignored her work  180  although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s  181  Some academic philosophers have criticized Rand for what they consider her lack of rigor and limited understanding of philosophical subject matter  3  94 The Philosophical Lexicon  a satirical web site maintained by philosophers Daniel Dennett and Asbj rn Steglich Petersen  defines a  rand  as   An angry tirade occasioned by mistaking philosophical disagreement for a personal attack and or evidence of unspeakable moral corruption   182 Chris Matthew Sciabarra has called into question the motives of some of Rand s critics because of what he calls the unusual hostility of their criticisms  183  Sciabarra writes   The left was infuriated by her anti communist  pro capitalist politics  whereas the right was disgusted with her atheism and civil libertarianism   3  Rand scholars Douglas Den Uyl and Douglas B  Rasmussen  while stressing the importance and originality of her thought  describe her style as  literary  hyperbolic and emotional   184  Philosopher Jack Wheeler says that despite  the incessant bombast and continuous venting of Randian rage   Rand s ethics are  a most immense achievement  the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought   185  In the Literary Encyclopedia entry for Rand written in 2001  John Lewis declared that  Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation   186  In a 1999 interview in the Chronicle of Higher Education  Rand scholar Chris Matthew Sciabarra commented   I know they laugh at Rand   while forecasting a growth of interest in her work in the academic community  187   edit  Objectivist movement Main article  Objectivist movement In 1985  Rand s heir Leonard Peikoff established the Ayn Rand Institute  a nonprofit organization dedicated to spreading Rand s ideas and promoting her works  In 1990  philosopher David Kelley founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies  now known as The Atlas Society  188  In 2001 historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship  which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia  189  The charitable foundation of BB amp T Corporation has also given grants for teaching Rand s ideas or works  The University of Texas at Austin  the University of Pittsburgh  and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are among the schools that have received grants  In some cases these grants have been controversial due to their requiring research or teaching related to Rand  190   edit  Selected works Wikisource has original works written by or about  Ayn Rand Main article
