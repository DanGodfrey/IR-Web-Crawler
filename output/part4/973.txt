materials  The magnetic field at any given point is specified by both a direction and a magnitude  or strength   as such it is a vector field  nb 1  The magnetic field is most commonly defined in terms of the Lorentz force it exerts on moving electric charges  There are two separate but closely related fields to which the name  magnetic field  can refer  a magnetic B field and a magnetic H field  Magnetic fields are produced by moving electric charges and the intrinsic magnetic moments of elementary particles associated with a fundamental quantum property  their spin  In special relativity  electric and magnetic fields are two interrelated aspects of a single object  called the electromagnetic field tensor  the aspect of the electromagnetic field that is seen as a magnetic field is dependent on the reference frame of the observer  In quantum physics  the electromagnetic field is quantized and electromagnetic interactions result from the exchange of photons  Magnetic fields have had many uses in ancient and modern society  The Earth produces its own magnetic field  which is important in navigation  Rotating magnetic fields are utilized in both electric motors and generators  Magnetic forces give information about the charge carriers in a material through the Hall effect  The interaction of magnetic fields in electric devices such as transformers is studied in

field  by Ren  Descartes  1644  It illustrated his theory that magnetism was caused by the circulation of tiny helical particles   threaded parts   through threaded pores in magnets  Although magnets and magnetism were known much earlier  one of the first descriptions of the magnetic field was produced in 1269 by the French scholar Petrus Peregrinus nb 2  who mapped out the magnetic field on the surface of a spherical magnet using iron needles  Noting that the resulting field lines crossed at two points he named those points  poles  in analogy to Earth s poles  Almost three centuries later  William Gilbert of Colchester replicated Petrus Peregrinus  work and was the first to state explicitly that Earth itself was a magnet  1  Gilbert s great work De Magnete was published in 1600 and helped to establish the study of magnetism as a science  In 1750  John Michell published 2  that magnetic poles attract and repel with an inverse square law  3  Later  in 1785  Charles Augustin de Coulomb verified Michell s law and stated explicitly that the North and South poles cannot be separated  4  One of the first successful models of the magnetic field was developed in 1824 by Sim on Denis Poisson  1781 1840   5  His model was built on the inverse square law force between magnetic poles and is exactly analogous to modern electrostatics with a magnetic H field being produced by  magnetic poles  in the same way that an electric field E field is produced by electric charges  Poisson s model also introduced the magnetic scalar potential  Three remarkable discoveries though  would challenge Poisson s model  First  in 1819  Hans Christian Oersted discovered that an electric current generates a magnetic field encircling it  Then  Andr  Marie Amp re showed that parallel wires having currents in the same direction attract one another  Finally Jean Baptiste Biot and F lix Savart discovered the Biot Savart law which correctly predicts the magnetic field around any current carrying wire  In 1825  Ampere published the results of his comprehensive study of the magnetic properties of currents for which he coined the term electrodynamics  In it he showed the equivalence of electrical currents to magnets  6  With this equivalence  Amp re viewed the current loops as being the more fundamental and imagined that magnetic molecules contained perpetually flowing loops of current  In this model  later called the Amp rian loop model  current loops  called magnetic dipoles  would replace the dipoles of charge of the Poisson s model  nb 3  No magnetic charges are needed which has the additional benefit of explaining why magnetic charge can not be isolated  In this work as well  Amp re derived his Amp re s force law which describes the force between two currents  Finally it included his Amp re s law which like the Biot Savart law correctly described the magnetic field generated by a steady current but was more general  In 1831  Michael Faraday showed that a changing magnetic field generates an encircling electric field and thereby demonstrated that electricity and magnetism are even more tightly knitted  Between 1861 and 1865  James Clerk Maxwell developed and published a set of Maxwell s equations which explained and united all of classical electricity and magnetism  The first set of these equations was published in a paper entitled On Physical Lines of Force in 1861  The mechanism that Maxwell proposed to underlie these equations in this paper was fundamentally incorrect  which is not surprising since it predated the modern understanding even of the atom  Yet  the equations were valid although incomplete  He completed the set of Maxwell s equations in his later 1865 paper A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field and demonstrated the fact that light is an electromagnetic wave  Thus  he theoretically unified not only electricity and magnetism but light as well  This fact was then later confirmed experimentally by Heinrich Hertz in 1887  Even though the classical theory of electrodynamics was essentially complete with Maxwell s equations  the twentieth century saw a number of improvements and extensions to the theory  Albert Einstein  in his great paper of 1905 that established relativity  showed that both the electric and magnetic fields are part of the same phenomena viewed from different reference frames   See moving magnet and conductor problem for details about the thought experiment that eventually helped Albert Einstein to develop special relativity   Finally  the emergent field of quantum mechanics was merged with electrodynamics to form quantum electrodynamics or QED   edit  Definitions  units  and measurement Magnetic field can be defined in many equivalent ways based on the effects it has on its environment  For instance  a particle having an electric charge  q  and moving in a magnetic field with a velocity  v  experiences a force  F  called the Lorentz force  See force on a charged particle below  Alternatively  the magnetic field can be defined in terms of the torque it produces on a magnetic dipole  See magnetic torque on permanent magnets below  Devices used to measure the local magnetic field are called magnetometers  Important classes of magnetometers include using a rotating coil  Hall effect magnetometers  NMR magnetometers  SQUID magnetometers  and fluxgate magnetometers  The magnetic fields of distant astronomical objects are measured through their effects on local charged particles  For instance  electrons spiraling around a field line produce synchrotron radiation which is detectable in radio waves  Alternative names for B 7  Magnetic flux density Magnetic induction Magnetic field Alternative names for H 7  8  Magnetic field intensity Magnetic field strength Magnetic field Magnetizing field There are two magnetic fields  H and B  In a vacuum they are indistinguishable  differing only by a multiplicative constant that depends on the physical units  Inside a material they are different  see H and B inside and outside of magnetic materials   The term magnetic field is historically reserved for H while using other terms for B  Informally  though  and formally for some recent textbooks mostly in physics  the term  magnetic field  is used to describe B as well as or in place of H  nb 4  There are many alternative names for both  see sidebar to right   The B field is measured in teslas in SI units and in gauss in cgs units   1 tesla   10 000 gauss   The SI unit of tesla is equivalent to  newton second   coulomb metre   nb 5  The H field is measured in ampere turn per metre  A m  in SI units  and in oersteds  Oe  in cgs units  9  The smallest precision level for a magnetic field measurement 10  is on the order of attoteslas  10 18 tesla   the largest magnetic field produced in a laboratory is 2 8 kT  VNIIEF in Sarov  Russia  1998   11  The magnetic field of some astronomical objects such as magnetars are much higher  magnetars range from 0 1 to 100 GT  108 to 1011 T   12  See orders of magnitude  magnetic field    edit  Magnetic field lines Main article  Field line Compasses reveal the direction of the local magnetic field  As seen here  the magnetic field points towards a magnet s south pole and away from its north pole  Mapping the magnetic field of an object is simple in principle  First  measure the strength and direction of the magnetic field at a large number of locations  Then  mark each location with an arrow  called a vector  pointing in the direction of the local magnetic field with a length proportional to the strength of the magnetic field  A simpler way to visualize the magnetic field is to  connect  the arrows to form  magnetic field lines   Magnetic field lines make it much easier to visualize and understand the complex mathematical relationships underlying magnetic field  If done carefully  a field line diagram contains the same information as the vector field it represents  The magnetic field can be estimated at any point on a magnetic field line diagram  whether on a field line or not  using the direction and density of nearby magnetic field lines  nb 6  A higher density of nearby field lines indicates a stronger magnetic field  The direction of magnetic field lines represented by the alignment of iron filings sprinkled on paper placed above a bar magnet  The mutual attraction of opposite poles of the iron filings results in the formation of elongated clusters of filings along  field lines   The field is not precisely the same as around the isolated magnet  the magnetization of the filings alters the field somewhat  citation needed  Various phenomena have the effect of  displaying  magnetic field lines as though the field lines are physical phenomena  For example  iron filings placed in a magnetic field line up to form lines that correspond to  field lines   Magnetic fields  lines  are also visually displayed in polar auroras  in which plasma particle dipole interactions create visible streaks of light that line up with the local direction of Earth s magnetic field  However  field lines are a visual and conceptual aid only and are no more real than  for example  the contour lines  constant altitude  on a topographic map  They do not exist in the actual field  a different choice of mapping scale could show twice as many  lines  or half as many  Field lines can be used as a qualitative tool to visualize magnetic forces  In ferromagnetic substances like iron and in plasmas  magnetic forces can be understood by imagining that the field lines exert a tension   like a rubber band  along their length  and a pressure perpendicular to their length on neighboring field lines   Unlike  poles of magnets attract because they are linked by many field lines   like  poles repel because their field lines do not meet  but run parallel  pushing on each other  Most physical phenomena that  display  magnetic field lines do not include which direction along the lines that the magnetic field is in  A compass  though  reveals that magnetic field lines outside of a magnet point from the north pole  compass points away from north pole  to the south  compass points toward the south pole   The magnetic field of a straight current carrying wire encircles the wire with a direction that depends on the direction of the current and that can be measured with a compass as well   edit  Magnetic field and permanent magnets Main article  Magnet Permanent magnets are objects that produce their own persistent magnetic fields  They are made of ferromagnetic materials  such as iron and nickel  that have been magnetized  and they have both a north and a south pole   edit  Magnetic field of permanent magnets Main articles  Magnetic moment and Two definitions of moment The magnetic field of permanent magnets can be quite complicated  especially near the magnet  The magnetic field of a small nb 7  straight magnet is proportional to the magnet s strength  called its magnetic dipole moment m   The equations are non trivial and also depend on the distance from the magnet and the orientation of the magnet  For simple magnets  m points in the direction of a line drawn from the south to the north pole of the magnet  Flipping a bar magnet is equivalent to rotating its m by 180 degrees  The magnetic field of larger magnets can be obtained by modelling them as a collection of a large number of small magnets called dipoles each having their own m  The magnetic field produced by the magnet then is the net magnetic field of these dipoles  And  any net force on the magnet is a result of adding up the forces on the individual dipoles  There are two competing models for the nature of these dipoles  These two models produce two different magnetic fields  H and B  Outside a material  though  the two are identical  to a multiplicative constant  so that in many cases the distinction can be ignored  This is particularly true for magnetic fields  such as those due to electric currents  that are not generated by magnetic materials   edit  Magnetic pole model and the H field The magnetic pole model  two opposing poles  North     and South      separated by a distance d produce an H field  lines   It is sometimes useful to model the force and torques between two magnets as due to magnetic poles repelling or attracting each other in the same manner as the Coulomb force between electric charges  In this model  a magnetic H field is produced by magnetic charges that are  smeared  around each pole  The H field  therefore  is analogous to the electric field E which starts at a positive electric charge and ends at a negative electric charge  Near the north pole  therefore  all H field lines point away from the north pole  whether inside the magnet or out  while near the south pole  whether inside the magnet or out  all H field lines point toward the south pole  A north pole  then  feels a force in the direction of the H field while the force on the south pole is opposite to the H field  In the magnetic pole model  the elementary magnetic dipole m is formed by two opposite magnetic poles of pole strength qm separated by a very small distance d  such that m   qm d  Unfortunately  magnetic poles cannot exist apart from each other  all magnets have north south pairs which cannot be separated without creating two magnets each having a north south pair  Further  magnetic poles do not account for magnetism that is produced by electric currents nor the force that a magnetic field applies to moving electric charges   edit  Amperian loop model and the B field See also  Gauss s law for magnetism The Amperian loop model  A current loop  ring  which goes into the page at the x and comes out at the dot produces a B field  lines   The north pole is to the right and the south to the left  After Oersted discovered that electric currents produce a magnetic field and Ampere discovered that electric currents attracted and repelled each other similar to magnets  it was natural to hypothesize that all magnetic fields are due to electric current loops  In this model developed by Ampere  the elementary magnetic dipole that makes up all magnets is a sufficiently small Amperian loop of current I  The dipole moment of this loop is m   I A where A is the area of the loop  These magnetic dipoles produce a magnetic B field  One important property of the B field produced this way is that magnetic B field lines neither start nor end  mathematically  B is a solenoidal vector field   a field line either extends to infinity or wraps around to form a closed curve  nb 8  To date no exception to this rule has been found   See magnetic monopole below   Magnetic field lines exit a magnet near its north pole and enter near its south pole  but inside the magnet B field lines continue through the magnet from the south pole back to the north  nb 9  If a B field line enters a magnet somewhere it has to leave somewhere else  it is not allowed to have an end point  Magnetic poles  therefore  always come in N and S pairs  More formally  since all the magnetic field lines that enter any given region must also leave that region  subtracting the  number  nb 10  of field lines that enter the region from the number that exit gives identically zero  Mathematically this is equivalent to    where the integral is a surface integral over the closed surface S  a closed surface is one that completely surrounds a region with no holes to let any field lines escape   Since dA points outward  the dot product in the integral is positive for B field pointing out and negative for B field pointing in  There is also a corresponding differential form of this equation covered in Maxwell s equations below   edit  Force between magnets Main article  Force between magnets The force between two small magnets is quite complicated and depends on the strength and orientation of both magnets and the distance and direction of the magnets relative to each other  The force is particularly sensitive to rotations of the magnets due to magnetic torque  The force on each magnet depends on its magnetic moment and the magnetic field nb 11  of the other  To understand the force between magnets  it is useful to examine the magnetic pole model given above  In this model  the H field of one magnet pushes and pulls on both poles of a second magnet  If this H field is the same at both poles of the second magnet then there is no net force on that magnet since the force is opposite for opposite poles  If  however  the magnetic field of the first magnet is nonuniform  such as the H near one of its poles   each pole of the second magnet sees a different field and is subject to a different force  This difference in the two forces moves the magnet in the direction of increasing magnetic field and may also cause a net torque  This is a specific example of a general rule that magnets are attracted  or repulsed depending on the orientation of the magnet  into regions of higher magnetic field  Any non uniform magnetic field whether caused by permanent magnets or by electric currents will exert a force on a small magnet in this way  The details of the Amperian loop model are different and more complicated but yield the same result  that magnetic dipoles are attracted repelled into regions of higher magnetic field  Mathematically  the force on a small magnet having a magnetic moment m due to a magnetic field B is  13  where the gradient   is the change of the quantity m   B per unit distance and the direction is that of maximum increase of m   B  To understand this equation  note that the dot product m   B   mBcos     where m and B represent the magnitude of the m and B vectors and   is the angle between them  If m is in the same direction as B then the dot product is positive and the gradient points  uphill  pulling the magnet into regions of higher B field  more strictly larger m   B   This equation is strictly only valid for magnets of zero size  but is often a good approximation for not too large magnets  The magnetic force on larger magnets is determined by dividing them into smaller regions having their own m then summing up the forces on each of these regions   edit  Magnetic torque on permanent magnets Main article  Magnetic torque If two like poles of two separate magnets are brought near each other and one of the magnets is allowed to turn it will promptly rotate to align itself with the first  In this example  the magnetic field of the stationary magnet creates a magnetic torque on the magnet that is free to rotate  This magnetic torque   tends to align a magnet s poles with the magnetic field lines  A compass  therefore  will turn to align itself with earth s magnetic field  Magnetic torque is used to drive electric motors  In one simple motor design  a magnet is fixed to a freely rotating shaft and subjected to a magnetic field from an array of electromagnets  By continuously switching the electric current through each of the electromagnets  thereby flipping the polarity of their magnetic fields  like poles are kept next to the rotor  the resultant torque is transferred to the shaft  See Rotating magnetic fields below  torque on a dipole  An H field  to right  causes equal but opposite forces on a N pole   q  and a S pole   q  creating a torque  As is the case for the force between magnets  the magnetic pole model leads more readily to the correct equation  Here  two equal and opposite magnetic charges experiencing the same H also experience equal and opposite forces  Since these equal and opposite forces are in different locations  this produces a torque proportional to the distance  perpendicular to the force  between them  With the definition of m as the pole strength times the distance between the poles  this leads to      0mHsin   where  0 is a constant called the magnetic constant and   is the angle between H and m  The Amperian loop model also predicts the same magnetic torque  Here  it is the B field interacting with the Amperian current loop through a Lorentz force described below  Again  the results are the same although the models are completely different  Cross product   a   b    a b sin   Mathematically  the torque   on a small magnet is proportional both to the applied magnetic field and to the magnetic moment m of the magnet  where   represents the vector cross product  Note that this equation includes all of the qualitative information included above  There is no torque on a magnet if m is in the same direction as the magnetic field   The cross product is zero for two vectors that are in the same direction   Further  all other orientations feel a torque that twists them toward the direction of magnetic field   edit  Magnetic field and electric currents Currents of electric charges both generate a magnetic field and feel a force due to magnetic B fields   edit  Magnetic field due to moving charges and electric currents Main articles  Electromagnet  Biot Savart law  and Amp re s law Right hand grip rule  a current flowing in the direction of the white arrow produces a magnetic field shown by the red arrows  All moving charged particles produce magnetic fields  Moving point charges  such as electrons  produce complicated but well known magnetic fields that depend on the charge  velocity  and acceleration of the particles  14  Magnetic field lines form in concentric circles around a cylindrical current carrying conductor  such as a length of wire  The direction of such a magnetic field can be determined by using the  right hand grip rule   see figure at right   The strength of the magnetic field decreases with distance from the wire   For an infinite length wire the strength decreases inversely proportional to the distance   Solenoid Bending a current carrying wire into a loop concentrates the magnetic field inside the loop while weakening it outside  Bending a wire into multiple closely spaced loops to form a coil or  solenoid  enhances this effect  A device so formed around an iron core may act as an electromagnet  generating a strong  well controlled magnetic field  An infinitely long cylindrical electromagnet has a uniform magnetic field inside  and no magnetic field outside  A finite length electromagnet produces a magnetic field that looks similar to that produced by a uniform permanent magnet  with its strength and polarity determined by the current flowing through the coil  The magnetic field generated by a steady current  a constant flow of electric charges in which charge is neither accumulating nor depleting at any point  nb 12  is described by the Biot Savart law  where the integral sums over the wire length where vector d  is the direction of the current   0 is the magnetic constant  r is the distance between the location of d  and the location at which the magnetic field is being calculated  and r  is a unit vector in the direction of r  A slightly more general 15  nb 13  way of relating the current to the B field is through Amp re s law  where the line integral is over any arbitrary loop and enc is the current enclosed by that loop  Amp re s law is always valid for steady currents and can be used to calculate the B field for certain highly symmetric situations such as an infinite wire or an infinite solenoid  In a modified form that accounts for time varying electric fields  Amp re s law is one of four Maxwell s equations that describe electricity and magnetism

inhomogeneous magnetic field  grad H  Magnetic force on charged particles and currents  shown in 3d  The electric current shown here is conventional  the real current would be a charge of  q flowing in exactly the opposite direction  Only one charge carrier is shown to prevent cluttering the diagram  r1 is the position of entry into the field B  r2 is the exit  The vector l is the integral  sum  of all infinitesimal vectors dr from r1 to r2   edit  Force on a charged particle Main article  Lorentz force A charged particle moving in a B field experiences a sideways force that is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field  the component of the velocity that is perpendicular to the magnetic field and the charge of the particle  This force is known as the Lorentz force  and is given by where F is the force  q is the electric charge of the particle  v is the instantaneous velocity of the particle  and B is the magnetic field  in teslas   The Lorentz force is always perpendicular to both the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field that created it  When a charged particle moves in a static magnetic field it will trace out a helical path in which the helix axis is parallel to the magnetic field and in which the speed of the particle will remain constant  Because the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the motion  the magnetic field can do no work on an isolated charge  It can only do work indirectly  via the electric field generated by a changing magnetic field  It is often claimed that the magnetic force can do work to a non elementary magnetic dipole  or to charged particles whose motion is constrained by other forces  but this is incorrect 16  because the work in those cases is performed by the electric forces of the charges deflected by the magnetic field   edit  Force on current carrying wire Main article  Laplace force The force on a current carrying wire is similar to that of a moving charge as expected since a charge carrying wire is a collection of moving charges  A current carrying wire feels a force in the presence of a magnetic field  The Lorentz force on a macroscopic current is often referred to as the Laplace force  Consider a conductor of length l  cross section A  and charge q which is due to electric current i  If this conductor is placed in a magnetic field of induction B which makes an angle    theta  with the velocity of charges in the conductor  the force exerted on a single charge q is   so  for N charges where   the force exerted on the conductor is     where   The right hand rule  Pointing the thumb of the right hand in the direction of the conventional current and the fingers in the direction of the B field the force on the current points out of the palm  The force is reversed for a negative charge   edit  Direction of force See also  Right hand rule The direction of force on a charge or a current can be determined by a mnemonic known as the right hand rule  See the figure on the left  Using the right hand and pointing the thumb in the direction of the moving positive charge or positive current and the fingers in the direction of the magnetic field the resulting force on the charge points outwards from the palm  The force on a negatively charged particle is in the opposite direction  If both the speed and the charge are reversed then the direction of the force remains the same  For that reason a magnetic field measurement  by itself  cannot distinguish whether there is a positive charge moving to the right or a negative charge moving to the left   Both of these cases produce the same current   On the other hand  a magnetic field combined with an electric field can distinguish between these  see Hall effect below  An alternative mnemonic to the right hand rule is Fleming s left hand rule   edit  Relation between H and B The formulas derived for the magnetic field above are correct when dealing with the entire current  A magnetic material placed inside a magnetic field  though  generates its own bound current which can be a challenge to calculate   This bound current is due to the sum of atomic sized current loops and the spin of the subatomic particles such as electrons that make up the material   The H field as defined above helps factor out this bound current  but in order to see how  it helps to introduce the concept of magnetization first   edit  Magnetization Main article  Magnetization The magnetization field M represents how strongly a region of material is magnetized  It is defined as the net magnetic dipole moment per unit volume of that region  The magnetization of a uniform magnet  therefore  is a constant in the material equal to its magnetic moment  m  divided by its volume  Since the SI unit of magnetic moment is ampere turn meter2  the SI unit of magnetization M is ampere turn per meter which is identical to that of the H field  The magnetization M field of a region points in the direction of the average magnetic dipole moment in that region  Magnetization field lines  therefore  begin near the magnetic south pole and ends near the magnetic north pole   Magnetization does not exist outside of the magnet   In the Amperian loop model  the magnetization is due to combining many tiny Amperian loops to form a resultant current called bound current  This bound current  then  is the source of the magnetic B field due to the magnet   See Magnetic dipoles below and magnetic poles vs  atomic currents for more information   Given the definition of the magnetic dipole  the magnetization field follows a similar law to that of Ampere s law  17  where the integral is a line integral over any closed loop and Ib is the  bound current  enclosed by that closed loop  In the magnetic pole model  magnetization begins at and ends at magnetic poles  If a given region  therefore  has a net positive  magnetic pole strength   corresponding to a north pole  then it will have more magnetization field lines entering it than leaving it  Mathematically this is equivalent to    where the integral is a closed surface integral over the closed surface S and qM is the  magnetic charge   in units of magnetic flux  enclosed by S   A closed surface completely surrounds a region with no holes to let any field lines escape   The negative sign occurs because the magnetization field moves from south to north   edit  H field and magnetic materials See also  demagnetizing field The H field is defined as   definition of H in SI units  With this definition  Ampere s law becomes  where If represents the  free current  enclosed by the loop so that the line integral of H does not depend at all on the bound currents  18  For the differential equivalent of this equation see Maxwell s equations  Ampere s law leads to the boundary condition where Kf is the surface free current density  19  Similarly  a surface integral of H over any closed surface is independent of the free currents and picks out the  magnetic charges  within that closed surface  which does not depend on the free currents  The H field  therefore  can be separated into two nb 14  independent parts  where H0 is the applied magnetic field due only to the free currents and Hd is the demagnetizing field due only to the bound currents  The magnetic H field  therefore  re factors the bound current in terms of  magnetic charges   The H field lines loop only around  free current  and  unlike the magnetic B field  begins and ends at near magnetic poles as well   edit  Magnetism Main article  Magnetism Most materials respond to an applied B field by producing their own magnetization M and therefore their own B field  Typically  the response is very weak and exists only when the magnetic field is applied  The term  magnetism  describes how materials respond on the microscopic level to an applied magnetic field and is used to categorize the magnetic phase of a material  Materials are divided into groups based upon their magnetic behavior  Diamagnetic materials 20  produce a magnetization that opposes the magnetic field  Paramagnetic materials 20  produce a magnetization in the same direction as the applied magnetic field  Ferromagnetic materials and the closely related ferrimagnetic materials and antiferromagnetic materials 21  22  can have a magnetization independent of an applied B field with a complex relationship between the two fields  Superconductors  and ferromagnetic superconductors  23  24  are materials that are characterized by perfect conductivity below a critical temperature and magnetic field  They also are highly magnetic and can be perfect diamagnets below a lower critical magnetic field  Superconductors often have a broad range of temperatures and magnetic fields  the so named mixed state  for which they exhibit a complex hysteretic dependence of M on B  In the case of paramagnetism and diamagnetism  the magnetization M is often proportional to the applied magnetic field such that  where   is a material dependent parameter called the permeability  In some cases the permeability may be a second rank tensor so that H may not point in the same direction as B  These relations between B and H are examples of constitutive equations  However  superconductors and ferromagnets have a more complex B to H relation  see magnetic hysteresis   edit  Energy stored in magnetic fields Main article  Magnetic energy See also  Magnetic hysteresis Energy is needed to generate a magnetic field both to work against the electric field that a changing magnetic field creates and to change the magnetization of any material within the magnetic field  For non dispersive materials this same energy is released when the magnetic field is destroyed so that this energy can be modeled as being stored in the magnetic field  For linear  non dispersive  materials  such that B    H where   is frequency independent   the energy density is  If there are no magnetic materials around then   can be replaced by  0  The above equation cannot be used for nonlinear materials  though  a more general expression given below must be used  In general  the incremental amount of work per unit volume  W needed to cause a small change of magnetic field  B is  Once the relationship between H and B is known this equation is used to determine the work needed to reach a given magnetic state  For hysteretic materials such as ferromagnets and superconductors the work needed will also depend on how the magnetic field is created  For linear non dispersive materials  though  the general equation leads directly to the simpler energy density equation given above   edit  Electromagnetism  the relationship between magnetic and electric fields Main article  Electromagnetism  edit  Faraday s Law  Electric force due to a changing B field Main articles  Faraday s law and Magnetic flux A changing magnetic field  such as a magnet moving through a conducting coil  generates an electric field  and therefore tends to drive a current in the coil   This is known as Faraday s law and forms the basis of many electrical generators and electric motors  Mathematically  Faraday s law is  where is the electromotive force  or EMF  the voltage generated around a closed loop  and  m is the magnetic flux the product of the area times the magnetic field normal to that area   This definition of magnetic flux is why B is often referred to as magnetic flux density   The negative sign is necessary and represents the fact that any current generated by a changing magnetic field in a coil produces a magnetic field that opposes the change in the magnetic field that induced it  This phenomenon is known as Lenz s Law  This integral formulation of Faraday s law can be converted nb 15  into a differential form  which applies under slightly different conditions  This form is covered as one of Maxwell s equations below   edit  Maxwell s correction to Amp re s Law  The magnetic field due to a changing electric field Main article  Maxwell s correction to Amp re s law Similar to the way that a changing magnetic field generates an electric field  a changing electric field generates a magnetic field  This fact is known as  Maxwell s correction to Amp re s law   Maxwell s correction to Amp re s Law bootstrap together with Faraday s law of induction to form electromagnetic waves  such as light  Thus  a changing electric field generates a changing magnetic field which generates a changing electric field again  Maxwell s correction to Amp re law is applied as an additive term to Ampere s law given above  This additive term is proportional to the time rate of change of the electric flux and is similar to Faraday s law above but with a different and positive constant out front   The electric flux through an area is proportional to the area times the perpendicular part of the electric field   This full Amp re law including the correction term is known as the Maxwell Amp re equation  It is not commonly given in integral form because the effect is so small that it can typically be ignored in most cases where the integral form is used  The Maxwell term is critically important in the creation and propagation of electromagnetic waves  These  though  are usually described using the differential form of this equation given below   edit  Maxwell s equations Main article  Maxwell s equations Like all vector fields  magnetic field has two important mathematical properties that relates it to its sources   For the B field the sources are currents and changing electric fields   These two properties  along with the two corresponding properties of the electric field  make up Maxwell s Equations  Maxwell s Equations together with the Lorentz force law form a complete description of classical electrodynamics including both electricity and magnetism  The first property is the divergence of a vector field A      A which represents how A  flows  outward from a given point  As discussed above  a B field line never starts or ends at a point but instead forms a complete loop  This is mathematically equivalent to saying that the divergence of B is zero   Such vector fields are called solenoidal vector fields   This property is called Gauss s law for magnetism and is equivalent to the statement that there are no isolated magnetic poles or magnetic monopoles  The electric field on the other hand begins and ends at electric charges so that its divergence is non zero and proportional to the charge density  See Gauss s law   The second mathematical property is called the curl  such that     A represents how A curls or  circulates  around a given point  The result of the curl is called a  circulation source   The equations for the curl of B and of E are called the Amp re Maxwell equation and Faraday s law respectively  They represent the differential forms of the integral equations given above  The complete set of Maxwell s equations then are  where J   complete microscopic current density and   is the charge density  Magnetic field  like all pseudovectors  changes sign when reflected in a mirror  When a current carrying loop  black  is reflected in a mirror  dotted line   its magnetic field  blue  is reflected and reversed  Technically  B is a pseudovector  also called an axial vector  due to being defined by a vector cross product   See diagram to right   As discussed above  materials respond to an applied electric E field and an applied magnetic B field by producing their own internal  bound  charge and current distributions that contribute to E and B but are difficult to calculate  To circumvent this problem  H and D fields are used to re factor Maxwell s equations in terms of the free current density Jf and free charge density  f  These equations are not any more general than the original equations  if the  bound  charges and currents in the material are known    They also need to be supplemented by the relationship between B and H as well as that between E and D  On the other hand  for simple relationships between these quantities this form of Maxwell s equations can circumvent the need to calculate the bound charges and currents   edit  Electric and magnetic fields  different aspects of the same phenomenon Main article  Relativistic electromagnetism According to the special theory of relativity  the partition of the electromagnetic force into separate electric and magnetic components is not fundamental  but varies with the observational frame of reference  An electric force perceived by one observer may be perceived by another  in a different frame of reference  as a magnetic force  or a mixture of electric and magnetic forces  Formally  special relativity combines the electric and magnetic fields into a rank 2 tensor  called the electromagnetic tensor  Changing reference frames mixes these components  This is analogous to the way that special relativity mixes space and time into spacetime  and mass  momentum and energy into four momentum   edit  Magnetic vector potential Main article  vector potential In advanced topics such as quantum mechanics and relativity it is often easier to work with a potential formulation of electrodynamics rather than in terms of the electric and magnetic fields  In this representation  the vector potential  A  and the scalar potential     are defined such that  The vector potential A may be interpreted as a generalized potential momentum per unit charge 25  just as   is interpreted as a generalized potential energy per unit charge  Maxwell s equations when expressed in terms of the potentials can be cast into a form that agrees with special relativity with little effort  26  In relativity A together with   forms the four potential analogous to the four momentum which combines the momentum and energy of a particle  Using the four potential instead of the electromagnetic tensor has the advantage of being much simpler  further it can be easily modified to work with quantum mechanics   edit  Quantum electrodynamics See also  Standard Model and quantum electrodynamics In modern physics  the electromagnetic field is understood to be not a classical field  but rather a quantum field  it is represented not as a vector of three numbers at each point  but as a vector of three quantum operators at each point  The most accurate modern description of the electromagnetic interaction  and much else  is Quantum electrodynamics  QED   27  which is incorporated into a more complete theory known as the  Standard Model of particle physics   In QED  the magnitude of the electromagnetic interactions between charged particles  and their antiparticles  is computed using perturbation theory  these rather complex formulas have a remarkable pictorial representation as Feynman diagrams in which virtual photons are exchanged  Predictions of QED agree with experiments to an extremely high degree of accuracy  currently about 10 12  and limited by experimental errors   for details see precision tests of QED  This makes QED one of the most accurate physical theories constructed thus far  All equations in this article are in the classical approximation  which is less accurate than the quantum description mentioned here  However  under most everyday circumstances  the difference between the two theories is negligible   edit  Important uses and examples of magnetic field  edit  Earth s magnetic field Main article  Earth s magnetic field A sketch of Earth s magnetic field representing the source of the field as a magnet  The geographic north pole of Earth is near the top of the diagram  the south pole near the bottom  The south pole of that magnet is deep in Earth s interior below Earth s North Magnetic Pole  The Earth s magnetic field is thought to be produced by convection currents in the outer liquid of Earth s core  The Dynamo theory proposes that these movements produce electric currents which  in turn  produce the magnetic field  28  The presence of this field causes a compass  placed anywhere within it  to rotate so that the  north pole  of the magnet in the compass points roughly north  toward Earth s north magnetic pole  This is the traditional definition of the  north pole  of a magnet  although other equivalent definitions are also possible  One confusion that arises from this definition is that  if Earth itself is considered as a magnet  the south pole of that magnet would be the one nearer the north magnetic pole  and vice versa 29   opposite poles attract  so the north pole of the compass magnet is attracted to the south pole of Earth s interior magnet   The north magnetic pole is so named not because of the polarity of the field there but because of its geographical location  The north and south poles of a permanent magnet are so called because they are  north seeking  and  south seeking   respectively  30  The figure to the right is a sketch of Earth s magnetic field represented by field lines  For most locations  the magnetic field has a significant up down component in addition to the North South component   There is also an East West component  Earth s magnetic poles do not coincide exactly with Earth s geological pole   The magnetic field can be visualised as a bar magnet buried deep in Earth s interior  Earth s magnetic field is not constant the strength of the field and the location of its poles vary  Moreover  the poles periodically reverse their orientation in a process called geomagnetic reversal  The most recent reversal occurred 780 000 years ago   edit  Rotating magnetic fields Main articles  Rotating magnetic field and Alternator The rotating magnetic field is a key principle in the operation of alternating current motors  A permanent magnet in such a field rotates so as to maintain its alignment with the external field  This effect was conceptualized by Nikola Tesla  and later utilized in his  and others   early AC  alternating current  electric motors  A rotating magnetic field can be constructed using two orthogonal coils with 90 degrees phase difference in their AC currents  However  in practice such a system would be supplied through a three wire arrangement with unequal currents  This inequality would cause serious problems in standardization of the conductor size and so  in order to overcome it  three phase systems are used where the three currents are equal in magnitude and have 120 degrees phase difference  Three similar coils having mutual geometrical angles of 120 degrees create the rotating magnetic field in this case  The ability of the three phase system to create a rotating field  utilized in electric motors  is one of the main reasons why three phase systems dominate the world s electrical power supply systems  Because magnets degrade with time  synchronous motors use DC voltage fed rotor windings which allows the excitation of the machine to be controlled and induction motors use short circuited rotors  instead of a magnet  following the rotating magnetic field of a multicoiled stator  The short circuited turns of the rotor develop eddy currents in the rotating field of the stator  and these currents in turn move the rotor by the Lorentz force  In 1882  Nikola Tesla identified the concept of the rotating magnetic field  In 1885  Galileo Ferraris independently researched the concept  In 1888  Tesla gained U S  Patent 381 968 for his work  Also in 1888  Ferraris published his research in a paper to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Turin   edit  Hall effect Main article  Hall effect The charge carriers of a current carrying conductor placed in a transverse magnetic field experience a sideways Lorentz force  this results in a charge separation in a direction perpendicular to the current and to the magnetic field  The resultant voltage in that direction is proportional to the applied magnetic field  This is known as the  Hall effect   The Hall effect is often used to measure the magnitude of a magnetic field  It is used as well to find the sign of the dominant charge carriers in materials such as semiconductors  negative electrons or positive holes    edit  Magnetic circuits Main article  Magnetic circuit An important use of H is in magnetic circuits where inside a linear material B     H  Here    is the magnetic permeability of the material  This result is similar in form to Ohm s law J     E  where J is the current density    is the conductance and E is the electric field  Extending this analogy  the counterpart to the macroscopic Ohm s law   I   V   R   is  where is the magnetic flux in the circuit  is the magnetomotive force applied to the circuit  and is the reluctance of the circuit  Here the reluctance is a quantity similar in nature to resistance for the flux  Using this analogy it is straightforward to calculate the magnetic flux of complicated magnetic field geometries  by using all the available techniques of circuit theory   edit  Magnetic field shape descriptions Schematic quadrupole magnet   four pole   magnetic field  There are four steel pole tips  two opposing magnetic north poles and two opposing magnetic south poles  An azimuthal magnetic field is one that runs east west  A meridional magnetic field is one that runs north south  In the solar dynamo model of the Sun  differential rotation of the solar plasma causes the meridional magnetic field to stretch into an azimuthal magnetic field  a process called the omega effect  The reverse process is called the alpha effect  31  A dipole magnetic field is one seen around a bar magnet or around a charged elementary particle with nonzero spin  A quadrupole magnetic field is one seen  for example  between the poles of four bar magnets  The field strength grows linearly with the radial distance from its longitudinal axis  A solenoidal magnetic field is similar to a dipole magnetic field  except that a solid bar magnet is replaced by a hollow electromagnetic coil magnet  A toroidal magnetic field occurs in a doughnut shaped coil  the electric current spiraling around the tube like surface  and is found  for example  in a tokamak  A poloidal magnetic field is generated by a current flowing in a ring  and is found  for example  in a tokamak  A radial magnetic field is one in which the field lines are directed from the center outwards  similar to the spokes in a bicycle wheel  An example can be found in a loudspeaker transducers  driver   32  A helical magnetic field is corkscrew shaped  and sometimes seen in space plasmas such as the Orion Molecular Cloud  33   edit  Magnetic dipoles Magnetic field lines around a  magnetostatic dipole  pointing to the right  Main article  Magnetic dipole See also  Spin magnetic moment and Micromagnetism The magnetic field of a magnetic dipole is depicted on the right  From outside  the ideal magnetic dipole is identical to that of an ideal electric dipole of the same strength  Unlike the electric dipole  a magnetic dipole is properly modeled as a current loop having a current I and an area a  Such a current loop has a magnetic moment of  where the direction of m is perpendicular to the area of the loop and depends on the direction of the current using the right hand rule  An ideal magnetic dipole is modeled as a real magnetic dipole whose area a has been reduced to zero and its current I increased to infinity such that the product m   Ia is finite  In this model it is easy to see the connection between angular momentum and magnetic moment which is the basis of the Einstein de Haas effect  rotation by magnetization  and its inverse  the Barnett effect or  magnetization by rotation   34  Rotating the loop faster  in the same direction  increases the current and therefore the magnetic moment  for example  It is sometimes useful to model the magnetic dipole similar to the electric dipole with two equal but opposite magnetic charges  one south the other north  separated by distance d  This model produces an H field not a B field  Such a model is deficient  though  both in that there are no magnetic charges and in that it obscures the link between electricity and magnetism  Further  as discussed above it fails to explain the inherent connection between angular momentum and magnetism   edit  Magnetic monopole  hypothetical  Main article  Magnetic monopole A magnetic monopole is a hypothetical particle  or class of particles  that has  as its name suggests  only one magnetic pole  either a north pole or a south pole   In other words  it would possess a  magnetic charge  analogous to an electric charge  Magnetic field lines would start or end on magnetic monopoles  so if they exist  they would give exceptions to the rule that magnetic field lines neither start nor end  Modern interest in this concept stems from particle theories  notably Grand Unified Theories and superstring theories  that predict either the existence  or the possibility  of magnetic monopoles  These theories and others have inspired extensive efforts to search for monopoles  Despite these efforts  no magnetic monopole has been observed to date  nb 16  In recent research  materials known as spin ices can simulate monopoles  but do not contain actual monopoles  citation needed   edit  See also General

unchanged when the coordinates are inverted    His Epistola Petri Peregrini de Maricourt ad Sygerum de Foucaucourt Militem de Magnete  which is often shortened to Epistola de magnete  is dated 1269 C E    It is a remarkable fact that from the  outside  the field of a dipole of magnetic charge has the exact same form as that of an elementary current loop called a magnetic dipole  It is therefore only for the physics of magnetism  inside  of magnetic material that the two models differ    Edward Purcell  in Electricity and Magnetism  McGraw Hill  1963  writes  Even some modern writers who treat B as the primary field feel obliged to call it the magnetic induction because the name magnetic field was historically preempted by H  This seems clumsy and pedantic  If you go into the laboratory and ask a physicist what causes the pion trajectories in his bubble chamber to curve  he ll probably answer  magnetic field   not  magnetic induction   You will seldom hear a geophysicist refer to the Earth s magnetic induction  or an astrophysicist talk about the magnetic induction of the galaxy  We propose to keep on calling B the magnetic field  As for H  although other names have been invented for it  we shall call it  the field H  or even  the magnetic field H   In a similar vein  M Gerloch  1983   Magnetism and Ligand field Analysis  Cambridge University Press  p  110  ISBN 0521249392  http   books google com  id Ovo8AAAAIAAJ amp pg PA110   says   So we may think of both B and H as magnetic fields  but drop the word  magnetic  from H so as to maintain the distinction     As Purcell points out   it is only the names that give trouble  not the symbols      This can be seen from the magnetic part of the Lorentz force law Fmag    qvB     The use of iron filings to display a field presents something of an exception to this picture  the filings alter the magnetic field so that it is much larger along the  lines  of iron  due to the large permeability of iron relative to air    Here  small  means that the observer is sufficiently far away that it can be treated as being infinitesimally small   Larger  magnets need to include more complicated terms in the expression and depend on the entire geometry of the magnet not just m    Magnetic field lines may also wrap around and around without closing but also without ending  These more complicated non closing non ending magnetic field lines are moot  though  since the magnetic field of objects that produce them are calculated by adding the magnetic fields of  elementary parts  having magnetic field lines that do form closed curves or extend to infinity    To see that this must be true imagine placing a compass inside a magnet  There  the north pole of the compass points toward the north pole of the magnet since magnets stacked on each other point in the same direction    As discussed above  magnetic field lines are primarily a conceptual tool used to represent the mathematics behind magnetic fields  The total  number  of field lines is dependent on how the field lines are drawn  In practice  integral equations such as the one that follows in the main text are used instead    Either B or H may be used for the magnetic field outside of the magnet    In practice  the Biot Savart law and other laws of magnetostatics are often used even when the currents are changing in time as long as it is not changing too quickly  It is often used  for instance  for standard household currents which oscillate sixty times per second    The Biot Savart law contains the additional restriction  boundary condition  that the B field must go to zero fast enough at infinity  It also depends on the divergence of B being zero  which is always valid   There are no magnetic charges     A third term is needed for changing electric fields and polarization currents  this displacement current term is covered in Maxwell s equations below    A complete expression for Faraday s law of induction in terms of the electric E and magnetic fields can be written as      where    t  is the moving closed path bounding the moving surface   t   and dA is an element of surface area of   t   The first integral calculates the work done moving a charge a distance d  based upon the Lorentz force law  In the case where the bounding surface is stationary  the Kelvin Stokes theorem can be used to show this equation is equivalent to the Maxwell Faraday equation    Two experiments produced candidate events that were initially interpreted as monopoles  but these are now regarded to be inconclusive  For
