autonomous government in Oregon Country in 1843  The Oregon Territory was created in 1848  and Oregon became the 33rd state on February 14  1859  Oregon is the 9th most extensive and the 27th most populous of the 50 United States  Salem is the state s capital and third most populous city  Portland is the most populous  Portland is the 29th largest U S  city  with a population of 583 776  2010 US Census  and a metro population of 2 241 841  2009 estimate   the 23rd largest U S  metro area  The valley of the Willamette River in western Oregon is the state s most densely populated area and is home to eight of the ten most populous cities  Oregon contains a diverse landscape including the windswept Pacific coastline  the volcanoes of the rugged and glaciated Cascade Mountain Range  many waterfalls  including Multnomah Falls   dense evergreen forests  mixed forests and deciduous forests at lower elevations  and high desert across much of the eastern portion of the state  extending into the Great Basin  The tall Douglas firs and redwoods along the rainy Western Oregon coast contrast with the lower density and fire prone pine tree and juniper forests covering portions of the eastern half of the state  Alder trees are common in the west and fix nitrogen for the conifers and aspen groves is common in eastern Oregon  Stretching east from Central Oregon  the state also includes semi arid shrublands  prairies  deserts  steppes  and meadows  Mount Hood is the highest point in the state at 11 249 feet  3 429 m   Crater Lake National Park is the only national park in

for at least 15 000 years  In recorded history  mentions of the land date to as early as the 16th century  During the 18th and 19th centuries  European powers   and later the United States   quarreled over possession of the region until 1846 when the U S  and Great Britain finalized division of the region  Oregon became a state in 1859 and is now home to over 3 8 million residents   edit  Earliest inhabitants This section requires expansion  Human habitation of the Pacific Northwest began at least 15 000 years ago  with the oldest evidence of habitation in Oregon found at Fort Rock Cave and the Paisley Caves in Lake County  Archaeologist Luther Cressman dated material from Fort Rock to 13 200 years ago  8  By 8000 B C  there were settlements throughout the state  with populations concentrated along the lower Columbia River  in the western valleys  and around coastal estuaries   edit  European exploration This section requires expansion  By the 16th century  Oregon was home to many Native American groups  including the Coquille  Ko Kwell   Bannock  Chasta  Chinook  Kalapuya  Klamath  Molalla  Nez Perce  Takelma  and Umpqua  9  10  11  12  The first Europeans to visit Oregon were Spanish explorers who sighted southern Oregon off the Pacific Coast in 1543  No Europeans returned to Oregon until 1778  when British captain James Cook explored the coast  13  French Canadian and metis trappers and missionaries arrived in the eastern part of the state in the late 18th century and early 19th century  many having travelled as members of Lewis and Clark and the 1811 Astor expeditions  Some stayed permanently  including  tienne Lussier  believed to be the first European farmer in the state of Oregon  The evidence of this French Canadian presence can be found in the numerous names of French origin in that part of the state  Charbonneau  Malheur Lake and River  Grande Ronde and Des Chutes Rivers  cities of La Grande  Ontario  etc   edit  During U S  westward expansion See also  History of the United States  1789 1849  and Oregon pioneer history The Lewis and Clark Expedition traveled through the region also in search of the Northwest Passage  They built their winter fort at Fort Clatsop  near the mouth of the Columbia River  British explorer David Thompson also conducted overland exploration  In 1811  David Thompson  of the North West Company  became the first European to navigate the entire Columbia River  Stopping on the way  at the junction of the Snake River  he posted a claim to the region for Great Britain and the North West Company  Upon returning to Montreal  he publicized the abundance of fur bearing animals in the area  Also in 1811  New Yorker John Jacob Astor financed the establishment of Fort Astoria at the mouth of the Columbia River as a western outpost to his Pacific Fur Company  14  this was the first permanent European settlement in Oregon  In the War of 1812  the British gained control of all Pacific Fur Company posts  The Treaty of 1818 established joint British and American occupancy of the region west of the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean  By the 1820s and 1830s  the Hudson s Bay Company dominated the Pacific Northwest from its Columbia District headquarters at Fort Vancouver  built in 1825 by the District s Chief Factor John McLoughlin across the Columbia from present day Portland   Map of Oregon

which a probate government was proposed  Doctor Ira Babcock of Jason Lee s Methodist Mission was elected Supreme Judge  Babcock chaired two meetings in 1842 at Champoeg   half way between Lee s mission and Oregon City   to discuss wolves and other animals of contemporary concern  These meetings were precursors to an all citizen meeting in 1843  which instituted a provisional government headed by an executive committee made up of David Hill  Alanson Beers  and Joseph Gale  This government was the first acting public government of the Oregon Country before annexation by the government of the United States  Also in 1841  Sir George Simpson  Governor of the Hudson s Bay Company  reversed the Hudson s Bay Company s long standing policy of discouraging settlement because it interfered with the lucrative fur trade  He directed that some 200 Red River Colony settlers be relocated to HBC farms near Fort Vancouver   the James Sinclair expedition   in an attempt to hold Columbia District  Starting in 1842 1843  the Oregon Trail brought many new American settlers to Oregon Country  For some time  it seemed that Britain and the United States would go to war for a third time in 75 years  see Oregon boundary dispute   but the border was defined peacefully in 1846 by the Oregon Treaty  The border between the United States and British North America was set at the 49th parallel  The Oregon Territory was officially organized in 1848  Settlement increased with the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850 and the forced relocation of the native population to Indian reservations in Oregon   edit  After statehood Oregon was admitted to the Union on February 14  1859  Founded as a refuge from disputes over slavery  Oregon had a  whites only  clause in its original state Constitution  15  At the outbreak of the American Civil War  regular U S  troops were withdrawn and sent east  Volunteer cavalry recruited in California were sent north to Oregon to keep peace and protect the populace  The First Oregon Cavalry served until June 1865  In the 1880s  the growth of railroads helped market the state s lumber  wheat  and the rapid growth of its cities   edit  20th and 21st centuries See

Industrial expansion began in earnest following the 1933 1937 construction of the Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River  Hydroelectric power  food  and lumber provided by Oregon helped fuel the development of the West  although the periodic fluctuations in the U S  building industry have hurt the state s economy on multiple occasions   edit  Name Main article  Oregon  toponym  Oregon welcome sign at Hells Canyon  The earliest known use of the name  spelled Ouragon  was in a 1765 petition by Major Robert Rogers to the Kingdom of Great Britain  The term referred to the then mythical River of the West  the Columbia River   By 1778 the spelling had shifted to Oregon  16  In his 1765 petition  Rogers wrote  17   The rout  sic    is from the Great Lakes towards the Head of the Mississippi  and from thence to the River called by the Indians Ouragon     One theory is the name comes from the French word ouragan   windstorm  or  hurricane    which was applied to the River of the West based on Native American tales of powerful Chinook winds of the lower Columbia River  or perhaps from firsthand French experience with the chinook winds of the Great Plains  At the time  the River of the West was thought to rise in western Minnesota and flow west through the Great Plains  18  Joaquin Miller explained in Sunset  magazine  in 1904 how Oregon s name was derived  19   The name  Oregon  is rounded down phonetically  from Aure il agua Oragua  Or a gon  Oregon given probably by the same Portuguese navigator that named the Farallones after his first officer  and it literally  in a large way  means cascades   Hear the waters   You should steam up the Columbia and hear and feel the waters falling out of the clouds of Mount Hood to understand entirely the full meaning of the name Aure il agua  Oregon   Another account  endorsed as the  most plausible explanation  in the book Oregon Geographic Names  was advanced by George R  Stewart in a 1944 article in American Speech  According to Stewart  the name came from an engraver s error in a French map published in the early 18th century  on which the Ouisiconsink  Wisconsin  River was spelled  Ouaricon sint   broken on two lines with the  sint below  so there appeared to be a river flowing to the west named  Ouaricon   According to the Oregon Tourism Commission  also known as Travel Oregon   present day Oregonians    r   o ni

to members of the media as a reminder of how to pronounce the name of his home state  21  22  The stickers are sold by the University of Oregon Bookstore  which credits the spelling as a joke that is meant  for Oregonians and Oregon fans everywhere who get a kick out of this hilarious mispronunciation of our state   23   edit  Geography See also  List of counties in Oregon  List of cities and

Mount Hood  were formed by the volcanic activity of Juan de Fuca Plate  a tectonic plate that poses a continued threat of volcanic activity and earthquakes in the region  The most recent major activity was the 1700 Cascadia earthquake   Washington s Mount St  Helens erupted in 1980  an event which was visible from Oregon   The Columbia River  which forms much of the northern border of Oregon  also played a major role in the region s geological evolution  as well as its economic and cultural development  The Columbia is one of North America s largest rivers  and one of two rivers to cut through the Cascades  the Klamath River in Southern Oregon is the other   About 15 000 years ago  the Columbia repeatedly flooded much of Oregon during the Missoula Floods  the modern fertility of the Willamette Valley is largely a result of those floods  Plentiful salmon made parts of the river  such as Celilo Falls  hubs of economic activity for thousands of years  In the 20th century  numerous hydroelectric dams were constructed along the Columbia  with major impacts on salmon  transportation and commerce  electric power  and flood control  Today  Oregon s landscape varies from rain forest in the Coast Range to barren desert in the southeast  which still meets the technical definition of a frontier  Oregon is 295 miles  475 km  north to south at longest distance  and 395 miles  636 km  east to west at longest distance  In land and water area  Oregon is the ninth largest state  covering 98 381 square miles  254 810 km2   24  The highest point in Oregon is the summit of Mount Hood  at 11 239 feet  3 426 m   and its lowest point is sea level of the Pacific Ocean along the Oregon coast  25  Its mean elevation is 3 300 feet  1 006 m   Crater Lake National Park is the

heavily influenced by the Pacific Ocean  The climate is mild  but periods of extreme hot and cold can affect parts of the state  Oregon s population centers  which lie mostly in the western part of the state  are moist and mild  while the lightly populated high deserts of Central and Eastern Oregon are much drier  Oregon s highest recorded temperature is 119  F  48  C  at Pendleton on August 10  1898  and the lowest recorded temperature is  54  F   48  C  at Seneca on February 10  1933   edit  Law and government The flags of the United States and Oregon flown side by side in downtown Portland  A writer in the Oregon Country book A Pacific Republic  written in 1839  predicted the territory was to become an independent republic  Four years later  in 1843  settlers of the Willamette Valley voted in majority for a republic government  34  The Oregon Country functioned in this way until August 13  1848  when Oregon was annexed by the United States and a territorial government was established  Oregon maintained a territorial government until February 14  1859  when it was granted statehood  35   edit  State See also  Government of Oregon Oregon state government has a separation of powers similar to the federal government  It has three branches  called departments by the state s constitution  a legislative department  the bicameral Oregon Legislative Assembly   an executive department which includes an  administrative department  and Oregon s governor serving as chief executive  and a judicial department  headed by the Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court  Governors in Oregon serve four year terms and are limited to two consecutive terms  but an unlimited number of total terms  Oregon has no lieutenant governor  in the event that the office of governor is vacated  Article V  Section 8a of the Oregon Constitution specifies that the Secretary of State is first in line for succession  36  The other statewide officers are Treasurer  Attorney General  Superintendent  and Labor Commissioner  The biennial Oregon Legislative Assembly consists of a thirty member Senate and a sixty member House  The state supreme court has seven elected justices  currently including the only two openly gay state supreme court justices in the nation  They choose one of their own to serve a six year term as Chief Justice  The only court that may reverse or modify a decision of the Oregon Supreme Court is the Supreme Court of the United States  The debate over whether to move to annual sessions is a long standing battle in Oregon politics  but the voters have resisted the move from citizen legislators to professional lawmakers  Because Oregon s state budget is written in two year increments and  having no sales tax  its revenue is based largely on income taxes  it is often significantly over  or under budget  Recent legislatures have had to be called into special session repeatedly to address revenue shortfalls resulting from economic downturns  bringing to a head the need for more frequent legislative sessions  Oregon Initiative 71  passed in 2010  mandates the Legislature to begin meeting every year  for 160 days in odd numbered years  and

Indian Tribe Oregonians have voted for the Democratic Presidential candidate in every election since 1988  In 2004 and 2006  Democrats won control of the state Senate and then the House  Since the late 1990s  Oregon has been represented by four Democrats and one Republican in the U S  House of Representatives  Since 2009  the state has had two Democratic Senators  Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley  Oregon voters have elected Democratic governors in every election since 1986  most recently electing John Kitzhaber over Republican Chris Dudley in 2010  The base of Democratic support is largely concentrated in the urban centers of the Willamette Valley  The eastern two thirds of the state beyond the Cascade Mountains typically votes Republican  in 2000 and 2004  George W  Bush carried every county east of the Cascades  However  the region s sparse population means that the more populous counties in the Willamette Valley usually outweigh the eastern counties in statewide elections  Oregon s politics are largely similar to those of neighboring Washington   for instance  in the contrast between urban and rural issues  In the 2002 general election  Oregon voters approved a ballot measure to increase the state minimum wage automatically each year according to inflationary changes  which are measured by the consumer price index  CPI   37  In the 2004 general election  Oregon voters passed ballot measures banning same sex marriage  38  and restricting land use regulation  39  In the 2006 general election  voters restricted the use of eminent domain and extended the state s discount prescription drug coverage  40  The distribution  sales and consumption of alcoholic beverages are regulated in the state by the Oregon Liquor Control Commission  Thus  Oregon is an Alcoholic beverage control state  While wine and beer are available in most grocery stores  few stores sell hard liquor  In March 2011  Oregon ranked amongst the top seven  Best  states in the American State

analysis of the 2004 presidential election  a political analyst found that according to the application of a Likert scale  Oregon boasted both the most liberal voters and the most conservative voters  making it the most politically polarized state in the country  44  During Oregon s history it has adopted many electoral reforms proposed during the Progressive Era  through the efforts of William S  U Ren and his Direct Legislation League  Under his leadership  the state overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure in 1902 that created the initiative and referendum for citizens to introduce or approve proposed laws or amendments to the state constitution directly  making Oregon the first state to adopt such a system  Today  roughly half of U S  states do so  45  In following years  the primary election to select party candidates was adopted in 1904  and in 1908 the Oregon Constitution was amended to include recall of public officials  More recent amendments include the nation s first doctor assisted suicide law  46  called the Death with Dignity law  which was challenged  unsuccessfully  in 2005 by the Bush administration in a case heard by the U S  Supreme Court   legalization of medical cannabis  and among the nation s strongest anti urban sprawl and pro environment laws  More recently  2004 s Measure 37 reflects a backlash against such land use laws  However  a further ballot measure in 2007  Measure 49  curtailed many of the provisions of 37  Of the measures placed on the ballot since 1902  the people have passed 99 of the 288 initiatives and 25 of the 61 referendums on the ballot  though not all of them survived challenges in courts  see Pierce v  Society of Sisters  for an example   During the same period  the legislature has referred 363 measures to the people  of which 206 have passed  Oregon pioneered the American use of postal voting  beginning with experimentation approved by the Oregon Legislative Assembly in 1981 and culminating with a 1998 ballot measure mandating that all counties conduct elections by mail  It remains the only state where voting by mail is the only method of voting  47  Under the leadership of Governor John Kitzhaber in 1994  Oregon was the first state in the US to set up effective health care programs with the Oregon Health Plan  which made health care available to most of its citizens without private health insurance  In the U S  Electoral College  Oregon casts seven votes  Oregon has supported Democratic candidates in the last six elections  Democrat Barack Obama won the state in 2008 by a margin of sixteen percentage points  with over 56  of the popular vote   edit  Economy Main article  Economy of Oregon A grain elevator in Halsey storing grass seed  one of the state s largest crops  The Gross

Land in the Willamette Valley owes its fertility to the Missoula Floods  which deposited lake sediment from Glacial Lake Missoula in western Montana onto the valley floor  49  Oregon is also one of four major world hazelnut growing regions  and produces 95  of the domestic hazelnuts in the United States  While the history of the wine production in Oregon can be traced to before Prohibition  it became a significant industry beginning in the 1970s  In 2005  Oregon ranked third among U S  states with 303 wineries  50  Due to regional similarities in climate and soil  the grapes planted in Oregon are often the same varieties found in the French regions of Alsace and Burgundy  In the Southern Oregon coast commercially cultivated cranberries account for about 7 percent of U S  production  and the cranberry ranks twenty third among Oregon s top fifty agricultural commodities  From 2006 to 2008  Oregon growers harvested between forty and forty nine million pounds of berries every year  Cranberry cultivation in Oregon uses about 27 000 acres in southern Coos and northern Curry counties  centered around the coastal city of Bandon  Oregon  In the northeastern region of the state  particularly around Pendleton  both irrigated and dry land wheat is grown  Oregon farmers and ranchers also produce cattle  sheep  dairy products  eggs and poultry   edit  Forestry and fisheries Vast forests have historically made Oregon one of the nation s major timber production and logging states  but forest fires  such as the Tillamook Burn   over harvesting  and lawsuits over the proper management of the extensive federal forest holdings have reduced the timber produced  According to the Oregon Forest Resources Institute  between 1989 and 2001 the amount of timber harvested from
