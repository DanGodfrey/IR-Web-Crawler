with dense forest and wetlands in floodplains and protected river valleys  and pothole wetlands in northern prairie areas  18  Most of Iowa is used for agriculture  crops cover 60  of the state  grasslands  mostly pasture and hay with some prairie and wetland  cover 30   and forests cover 7   urban areas and water cover another 1  each  19  The explosion in the number of high density livestock facilities in Iowa has led to increased risk of rural water contamination and a perceived decline in air quality  20  Other factors negatively affecting Iowa s environment include the extensive use of older coal fired power plants  21  fertilizer and pesticide runoff from crop production  22  and diminishment of the Jordan Aquifer  23  There is a dearth of natural areas in Iowa  less than 1  of the tallgrass prairie that once covered most of Iowa remain intact  only about 5  of the state s prairie pothole wetlands remain  and most of the original forest has been lost  24

common during the spring and summer months  with an average of 37 tornadoes in a single year  29  In 2008  twelve people were killed by tornadoes in Iowa  making it the deadliest year since 1968 and also the second most tornadoes in a year with 105  matching the total from 2001  30  Iowa summers are known for heat and humidity  with daytime temperatures often near 90  F  32  C  and sometimes

the state  with areas in the southeast of the state receiving an average of over 38 inches  97 cm  of rain annually  and the northwest of the state receiving less than 28 inches  71 cm   36  The pattern of precipitation across Iowa is seasonal  with more rain falling in the summer months  In Des Moines  roughly in the center of the state  over two thirds of the 34 72 inches  88 2 cm  of rain falls from April through September  and about half of the average annual precipitation falls from May through August  37   edit  Prehistory Excavation of the 3 800 year old Edgewater Park Site  Main articles  Iowa archaeology and Indians of Iowa When American Indians first arrived in what is now Iowa more than 13 000 years ago  they were hunters and gatherers living in a Pleistocene glacial landscape  By the time European explorers visited Iowa  American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic  social  and political systems  This transformation happened gradually  During the Archaic period  10 500 2 800 years ago   American Indians adapted to local environments and ecosystems  slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased  More than 3 000 years ago  during the Late Archaic period  American Indians in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants  The subsequent Woodland period saw an increased reliance on agriculture and social complexity  with increased use of mounds  ceramics  and specialized subsistence  During the Late Prehistoric period  beginning about AD 900  increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements  The arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval  with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders  There were numerous Indian tribes living in Iowa at the time of early European exploration  Tribes which were probably descendants of the prehistoric Oneota include the Dakota  Ho Chunk  Ioway  and Otoe  Tribes which arrived in Iowa in the late prehistoric or protohistoric periods include the Illiniwek  Meskwaki  Omaha  and Sauk  38   edit  History Main article  History of Iowa  edit  Early exploration and trade  1673 1808 Iowa in 1718  Modern state area highlighted  The first known European explorers to document Iowa were Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet who traveled the Mississippi River in 1673 documenting several Indian villages on the Iowa side  39  40  The area of Iowa was claimed for France and remained a French territory until 1763  The French  prior to their impending defeat in the French and Indian War  transferred ownership to their ally  Spain  41  Spain practiced very loose control over the Iowa region  granting trading licenses to French and British traders  who established trading posts along the Mississippi and Des Moines Rivers  39  Iowa was part of a territory known as La Louisiane or Louisiana  and European traders were interested in lead and furs obtained by Indians  The Sauk and Meskwaki effectively controlled trade on the Mississippi in the late 18th century and early 19th century  Among the early traders on the Mississippi were Julien Dubuque  Robert La Salle  and Paul Marin  39  Along the Missouri River at least five French and English trading houses were built prior to 1808  42  In 1800  Napoleon Bonaparte took control of Louisiana from Spain in a treaty  After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase  Iowa was placed under United States control  Much of Iowa was mapped by Zebulon Pike in 1805  43  but it was not until the construction of Fort Madison in 1808 that the U S  established tenuous military control over the region  44   edit  War of 1812 and unstable U S  control Plan of Fort Madison  1810  Fort Madison was built to control trade and establish U S  dominance over the Upper Mississippi  but it was poorly designed and disliked by the Sauk and Ho Chunk  many of whom allied with the British  who had not abandoned claims to the territory  44  45  Fort Madison was defeated by British supported Indians in 1813 during the War of 1812  and Fort Shelby in Prairie du Chien  Wisconsin  also fell to the British  Black Hawk took part in the siege of Fort Madison  46  47  After the war  the U S  reestablished control of the region through the construction of Fort Armstrong  Fort Snelling in Minnesota  and Fort Atkinson in Nebraska  48   edit  Trade and Indian removal  1814 1832 Map of Iowa Indian Territory Accessions The U S  encouraged settlement of the east side of the Mississippi and removal of Indians to the west  Trade continued in furs and lead  but disease and forced population movement decimated Indian cultures and economies  A disputed 1804 treaty between Quashquame and William Henry Harrison that surrendered much of Illinois to the U S  enraged many Sauk and led to the 1832 Black Hawk War  As punishment for the uprising  and as part of a larger settlement strategy  treaties were subsequently designed to remove all Indians from Iowa  The Sauk and Meskwaki were pushed out of the Mississippi valley in 1832  out of the Iowa River valley in 1843  and out of Iowa altogether in 1846  Many Meskwaki later returned to Iowa and settled near Tama  Iowa  the Meskwaki Settlement remains to this day  In 1856 the Iowa Legislature passed an unprecedented act allowing the Meskawki to purchase the land  Indians were not usually permitted to do so  The Ho Chunk were removed from Iowa in 1850  and the Dakota were removed by the late 1850s  Western Iowa around modern Council Bluffs was used as a way station for other tribes being moved west  including the Potawatomi   edit  U S  settlement and statehood  1832 1860 Iowa Territorial Seal  The first American settlers officially moved to Iowa in June 1833  49  Primarily  they were families from Ohio  Pennsylvania  New York  Indiana  Kentucky  and Virginia  49  On July 4  1838  the U S  Congress established the Territory of Iowa  President Martin Van Buren appointed Robert Lucas governor of the territory  which at the time had 22 counties and a population of 23 242  50  Almost immediately after achieving territorial status  a clamor arose for statehood  On December 28  1846  Iowa became the 29th state in the Union when President James K  Polk signed Iowa s admission bill into law  Once admitted to the Union  the state s boundary issues resolved  and most of its land purchased from the Indians  Iowa set its direction to development and organized campaigns for settlers and investors  boasting the young frontier state s rich farmlands  fine citizens  free and open society  and good government  51  Iowa has a long tradition of state and county fairs  The first and second Iowa State Fairs were held in the more developed eastern part of the state at Fairfield  The first fair was held October 25 27  1854  at a cost of around  323  Thereafter  the fair moved to locations closer to the center of the state and in 1886 found a permanent home in Des Moines  The State Fair has been held every year since except for the year 1898 due to the Spanish American War and the World s Fair being held in nearby Omaha  Nebraska  The fair was also a World War II wartime casualty from 1942 1945  52   edit  Civil War  1861 1865 Jane and Samuel Kirkwood  1852  Iowa supported the Union during the Civil War  voting heavily for Abraham Lincoln  though there was a strong antiwar  Copperhead  movement among settlers of southern origins and among Catholics  citation needed  There were no battles in the state  but Iowa sent large supplies of food to the armies and the eastern cities  Much of Iowa s support for the Union can be attributed to Samuel J  Kirkwood  its wartime governor  Of a total population of 675 000  about 116 000 men were subjected to military duty  Iowa contributed proportionately more men to Civil War military service than did any other state  north or south  sending more than 75 000 volunteers to the armed forces  over one sixth of whom were in their graves before the South surrendered at Appomattox  53  Most fought in the great campaigns in the Mississippi Valley and in the South  54  Iowa troops fought at Wilson s Creek in Missouri  Pea Ridge in Arkansas  Forts Henry and Donelson  Shiloh  Chattanooga  Chickamauga  Missionary Ridge  and Rossville Gap as well as Vicksburg  Iuka  and Corinth  They served with the Army of the Potomoc in Virginia and fought under Union General Philip Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley  Many died and were buried at Andersonville  They marched on General Nathaniel Banks  ill starred expedition to the Red River  Twenty seven Iowans have been awarded the Medal of Honor  the highest military decoration awarded by the United States government  which was first awarded in the Civil War  55  Iowa had several brigadier generals and four major generals Grenville Mellen Dodge  Samuel R  Curtis  Francis J  Herron  and Frederick Steele and saw many of its generals go on to state and national prominence following the war  53   edit  Agricultural expansion  1865 1930 Iowa farm  1875  Following the Civil War  Iowa s population continued to grow dramatically  from 674 913 people in 1860 to 1 194 020 in 1870  The introduction of railroads in the 1850s and 1860s transformed Iowa into a major agricultural producer  In 1917  the United States entered World War I and farmers as well as all Iowans experienced a wartime economy  For farmers  the change was significant  Since the beginning of the war in 1914  Iowa farmers had experienced economic prosperity  In the economic sector  Iowa also has undergone considerable change  Beginning with the first farm related industries developed in the 1870s  Iowa has experienced a gradual increase in the number of business and manufacturing operations   edit  Depression  World War II  and the rise of manufacturing  1930 1985 The transition from an agricultural economy to a mixed economy happened slowly  The Great Depression and World War II accelerated the shift away from smallholder farming to larger farms  and began a trend of urbanization that continues  The period since World War II has witnessed a particular increase in manufacturing operations  While agriculture continued to be the state s dominant industry  Iowans also produce a wide variety of products including refrigerators  washing machines  fountain pens  farm implements  and food products  The Farm Crisis of the 1980s caused a major recession in Iowa  causing poverty not seen since the Depression  56  The crisis spurred a major population decline in Iowa that lasted a decade  57   edit  Reemergence as a mixed economy  1985 present After bottoming out in the 1980s  Iowa s economy began to become increasingly less dependent on agriculture  and now has a mix of manufacturing  biotechnology  finance and insurance services  and government services  58  The population of Iowa has increased at a faster rate than the U S  as a whole  57  and Iowa now has a predominantly urban population  59   edit  Demographics  edit  Major Cities Iowa Population Density Map See also  List of

demographic information available shows that the state had a natural increase of 53 706 people in population from the last census  that is 197 163 births minus 143 457 deaths  and a decrease of 11 754 due to net migration of people out of the state  Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 29 386 people  while migration within the country produced a net loss of 41

began in the early 20th century  59  Urban counties in Iowa grew 8 5  from 2000 to 2008  while rural counties declined by 4 2   70  The shift from rural to urban has caused population increases in more urbanized counties such as Dallas  Johnson  Linn  and Polk  Scott  at the expense of more rural counties  71  Iowa  in common with other Midwestern states  especially Kansas  Nebraska  North Dakota  and South Dakota   is feeling the brunt of rural flight  although Iowa has been gaining population since approximately 1990  Some smaller communities  such as Denison and Storm Lake  have mitigated this population loss through gains in immigrant laborers  72  Another demographic problem for Iowa is the brain drain  in which educated young adults leave the state in search of better prospects in higher education or employment  During the 1990s  Iowa had the second highest exodus rate for single  educated young adults  second only to North Dakota  73  Significant loss of educated young people contributes to economic stagnation and the loss of services for remaining citizens   edit  Religion Amana Colonies were founded by German Pietists  A 2001 survey from the City University of New York found that 52  of Iowans are Protestant  while 23  are Catholic  and other religions made up 6   13  responded with non religious  and 5  did not answer  74  An ARDA survey of 2000 found that the largest Protestant denominations were the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America with 268 543 adherents  15 5  of those whose religious membership was known  and the United Methodist Church with 248 211  14 5    75  The study Religious Congregations  amp  Membership  2000 76  found that in the southernmost two tiers of Iowa counties and in other counties in the center of the state  the largest religious group was the United Methodist Church  in the northeast part of the state  including Dubuque and Linn counties  where Cedar Rapids is located   the Catholic Church was the largest  and in ten counties  including three in the northern tier  the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America was the largest  The study also found rapid growth in Evangelical Christian denominations  Dubuque is home to a Catholic archdiocese  which spans the northeastern section of Iowa  Historically  religious sects and orders who desired to live apart from the rest of society established themselves in

discrimination  especially in education  but was slow to achieve full integration in the 20th century  In the very first decision of the Iowa Supreme Court   In Re the Matter of Ralph  112  decided July 1839   the Court rejected slavery in a decision that found that a slave named Ralph became free when he stepped on Iowa soil  26 years before the end of the Civil War  113  The state did away with racial barriers to marriage in 1851  more than 100 years before the U S  Supreme Court would ban miscegenation statutes nationwide  114  The Iowa Supreme Court decided Clark v  The Board of Directors 115  in 1868  ruling that racially segregated  separate but equal  schools had no place in Iowa  85 years before Brown v  Board of Education  113  By 1875 a number of additional court

Full racial civil rights were codified under the Iowa Civil Rights Act of 1965  121  As with racial equality  Iowa was a vanguard in women s rights in the mid 19th century  but was slow to give women

admit women to the practice of law  with the Court ruling that women may not be denied the right to practice law in Iowa and admitting Arabella A  Mansfield to the practice of law  113  Several attempts to grant full voting rights to Iowa women were defeated between 1870 and 1919  In 1894 women were given  partial suffrage   which allowed them to vote on issues  but not for candidates  It was not until the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1920 that women had full suffrage in Iowa  123  Although Iowa supported the Federal Equal Rights Amendment  in 1980 and 1992 Iowa voters rejected an Equal Rights Amendment to the state constitution  124  Post Civil Rights era court decisions in Iowa clarified and expanded citizens  rights  The landmark U S  Supreme Court case Tinker v  Des Moines  1969  confirmed the right of students to express political views  The state s law criminalizing same sex sexual activity was repealed in June 1976  27 years
