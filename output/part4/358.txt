his first appearance in the pages of New Mutants  98 published in February 1991  Rob Liefeld  a fan of the Teen Titans comics  showed his new character to then writer Fabian Nicieza  Upon seeing the costume and noting his characteristics  killer with super agility   Nicieza contacted Liefeld  saying  this is Deathstroke from Teen Titans   Nicieza gave Deadpool the real name of  Wade Wilson  as an in joke to being  related  to  Slade Wilson   Deathstroke  5  In his first appearance  Deadpool was hired by Tolliver to attack Cable and the New Mutants  After subsequently appearing in X Force as a recurring character  Deadpool began making guest appearances in a number of different Marvel Comics titles such as the Avengers  Daredevil  and Heroes for Hire  In 1993  the character received his own miniseries  titled The Circle Chase  written by Fabian Nicieza and pencilled by Joe Madureira  It was a relative success and Deadpool starred in a second  self titled miniseries written in 1994 by Mark Waid  pencilled by Ian Churchill  and inked by Jason Temujin Minor and Bud LaRosa  Cover to the Harvey Award nominated Deadpool  11  Art by Pete Woods  in homage to cover of Amazing Fantasy  15 featuring Spider Man  In 1997  Deadpool was given his own ongoing title  initially written by Joe Kelly  with then newcomer Ed McGuinness as an artist  The series firmly established his supporting cast  including his prisoner den mother Blind Al and his best friend Weasel  Deadpool became an action comedy parody of the cosmic drama  antihero heavy comics of the time  The ongoing series gained cult popularity for its unorthodox main character and its balance of angst and pop culture slapstick and the character became less of a villain  though the element of his moral ambiguity remained  The writer Joe Kelly noted   With Deadpool  we could do anything we wanted because everybody just expected the book to be cancelled every five seconds  so nobody was paying attention  And we could get away with it   6  The series was taken over by Christopher Priest who noted that he found Kelly s issues to be  complex and a little hostile to new readers like me  and that by issue 37  he realized that  it was okay to make Deadpool look stupid   7   edit  2000s Deadpool lasted until issue  69  at which point it was relaunched as a new title by Gail Simone with a similar character called Agent X in 2002  This occurred during a line wide revamp of X Men related comics  with Cable becoming Soldier X and X Force becoming X Statix  Simone notes that  When I took the Deadpool job  the revamp hadn t been planned  so it was a complete surprise  Thankfully  we heard about it in time to make adjustments to the early scripts   8  It appeared that Deadpool was killed in an explosion fighting the aristocratic  and telepathic  villain known as the Black Swan  Weeks later  a mysterious figure showed up at the apartment of Deadpool s manager  Sandi Brandenberg  The man took the name Alex Hayden and together they started  Agency X   with Hayden dubbed Agent X after the company  Most believed that Hayden was Deadpool suffering from amnesia  The title character of Agent X was eventually revealed not to be Deadpool and the climax of that series saw the original character restored  Simone left the title after seven issues due to creative differences with the series editor  9  Deadpool s next starring appearance came in 2004 with the launch of Cable  amp  Deadpool written by Fabian Nicieza  where Deadpool became partnered with his former enemy  Cable  teaming up in various adventures  This title was canceled with issue  50 and replaced by a new Cable series in March 2008  10  Deadpool then appeared briefly in the Wolverine  Origins title by writer Daniel Way before Way and Paco Medina launched another Deadpool title in September 2008  11  Medina was the main series artist  with Carlo Barberi filling in on the first issue after the Secret Invasion tie in  12  A new Deadpool ongoing series written by Daniel Way with artist Paco Medina began as a Secret Invasion tie in  In the first arc  the character is seen working with Nick Fury to steal data on how to kill the Skrull queen Veranke  13  14 Norman Osborn steals the information that Deadpool had stolen from the Skrulls  and subsequent stories deal with the fallout from that  Writer Daniel Way explained   the first thing Osborn does to try and take care of the situation is to bring in a hired gun to take Deadpool down  which would be Tiger Shark  That would be the standard thing to do  but of course everything about Deadpool is non standard  So it goes completely awry and Norman has to get more serious about things   15  The story also sees the return of Bob  Agent of HYDRA   I don t want the book to become  Deadpool and Friends  so characters will drift in and out  but Bob was someone I definitely wanted to bring in  It just had to be at the perfect moment and when I was putting this storyline together that moment presented itself    15  This all led directly to a confrontation with the new Thunderbolts in  Magnum Opus  which crossed over between Deadpool vol  4  8 9 and Thunderbolts  130 131  15 Thunderbolts writer Andy Diggle said   it s a natural progression for Deadpool to go after Norman  and for Norman to send his personal hit squad after Deadpool   16  In Deadpool  15  Deadpool decides to become a hero resulting in conflicts with proper heroes like Spider Man 17   who he had recently encountered in The Amazing Spider Man  611 as part of  The Gauntlet  18   and leading to a 3 issue arc where he takes on Hit Monkey  19  a character who debuted in the same month in a digital  then print  one shot  20  21  Another ongoing Deadpool series  Deadpool  Merc with a Mouth launched in July 2009  written by Victor Gischler  with art by Bong Dazo  In it Deadpool teams up with the head of the zombie Deadpool from Marvel Zombies 3 and 4  22  23  24  A special anniversary issue titled Deadpool  900 was released in October 2009  It features stories written by several authors  with the main feature written by the original Deadpool series writer Joe Kelly and drawn by Deadpool s creator Rob Liefeld  A third Deadpool ongoing series  Deadpool Team Up  launched in November 2009  with issue numbers counting in reverse starting with issue  899   written by Fred Van Lente  with art by Dalibor Talajic  This series features Deadpool teaming up with different heroes from the Marvel Universe in each issue  such as Hercules  25  Deadpool also joined the cast of the new X Force team  26   edit  2010s Another Deadpool series  titled Deadpool Corps also by Gischler  was released in April 2010  Besides Deadpool himself  this series featured alternate versions of Deadpool  including Lady Deadpool  who debuted in Deadpool  Merc with a Mouth  7   Headpool  the zombie Deadpool head   and two new characters  Kidpool  a child  and Dogpool  a dog  27  28  The series lasted twelve issues  Marvel also published Deadpool titles through the Marvel Knights and MAX imprints  Deadpool  Wade Wilson s War  by Duane Swierczynski and Jason Pearson  29  30  31  and Deadpool MAX by David Lapham and Kyle Baker 32  respectively  Deadpool when   is written by Daniel Way and drawn by Al  Garza   edit  Powers and abilities This section relies on references to primary sources or sources affiliated with the subject  rather than references from independent authors and third party publications  Please add citations from reliable sources   November 2009  Deadpool s primary power is an accelerated healing factor  depicted by various artists and writers with varying levels of efficiency  Artificially endowed by the Weapon X program  this enables him to regenerate any destroyed tissues or organs at a super human rate as well as making him immune to known diseases and infections  An unanticipated side effect was a rapid acceleration of the cancerous tumors he was suffering from at the time  causing them to quickly spread across his entire body as soon as his powers fully activated  Because of this  his healing factor super charged his cancer  resulting in massive scar tissue causing his appearance to be severely disfigured  Deadpool s brain cells are similarly affected  with dying brain cells being rejuvenated at a super accelerated rate  This allows Deadpool to recover from any and all head wounds  and it renders him nearly invulnerable to psychic and telepathic powers  as the altered or damaged brain cells quickly regenerate to their original state  It is also the cause of his psychosis and mental instability  Deadpool s healing factor is strong enough that he has previously survived complete incineration and decapitation more than once  though in each of these occurrences  his head had to be reunited with his body to heal the wound instead of his body growing a new head  or vice versa   33  34  35  Unlike Wolverine s natural healing factor  Deadpool s is mentally driven to a partial extent  Similar to Wolverine  his healing factor also affects a number of his physical attributes by increasing them to superhuman levels heightening at least his endurance and stamina  Though it had been said in earlier years that he also had super human strength  that detail has apparently been glossed over  if not forgotten  as of late  36  Deadpool s body is highly resistant to most drugs and toxins  For example  it is extremely difficult  though not impossible  for him to become intoxicated  37  He can  however  be affected by certain drugs such as tranquilizers  if he is exposed to a massive enough dosage  Deadpool s healing factor also provides him with an extended lifespan by slowing the effects of the aging process to an unknown degree which cannot be measured as of yet  since he is not old enough to see any effect  However  his life span is extended to such a degree that he is still alive as Deadpool 800 years from the present as shown when the new X Force encountered him in the future  38  Aside from his physical advantages  Deadpool is a superb assassin and mercenary  an expert in multiple forms of martial arts  an expert swordsman and marksman  It has also been discussed that  while his psychosis and dissociative identity disorder is a handicap  it is also one of his greatest attributes as it makes him an extremely unpredictable opponent  Taskmaster  who has photo reflexive memory which allows him to copy anyone s fighting skills by observation  thus making him their equal in battle  was unable to defeat Deadpool due to his chaotic and improvised fighting style  39  It has also given him some protection from the effects of the Penance Stare  as all it did was show him what led to him becoming what he was  or as he put it  a  highlight  reel  and Ghost Rider turning back into Johnny Blaze  40  Over the years  Deadpool has owned a number of personal teleportation devices  Also  during Deadpool s first ongoing comic  he possessed a device which projected holographic disguises  allowing him to go undercover or conceal his appearance  In addition  Deadpool is multilingual and has demonstrated the ability to speak German  Spanish  and Japanese  Occasionally  Deadpool has also been shown as having a magic satchel  often pulling weapons out of nowhere  41   edit  Identity The character s back story has been presented as vague and subject to change  and within the narrative he is unable to remember his personal history due to his mental condition  Whether or not his name was even Wade Wilson is subject to speculation since one of his nemeses  T Ray  claims in Deadpool  33 that he is the real Wade Wilson and that Deadpool is a vicious murderer who stole his identity  42  There have been other dubious stories about his history   at one point the supervillain Loki claimed to be his father  43  Frequently  revelations are later retconned or ignored altogether  and in one issue  Deadpool himself joked that whether he is actually Wade Wilson depends on which writer the reader prefers best  44   edit  Other versions  edit  Ultimate Marvel A version of the character appears in Ultimate Spider Man  Depicted as an anti mutant extremist  he is a cyborg and leader of the Reavers who hunt mutants for sport on a reality TV show  Beneath the mask  this incarnation of Deadpool appears to be a skull with exposed brain  his skin formed by a transparent shell  He also has the ability to mimic an individual s appearance and voice  though not their powers  His real name is Sergeant  Wadey  Wilson  and he s a Gulf War veteran  45   edit  Age of Apocalypse In the Age of Apocalypse timeline  Deadpool was redubbed Dead Man Wade and reimagined as a bitter  humorless member of Apocalypse s Pale Riders  having received his flawed healing factor from Apocalypse s eugenics program  Sent with his team to invade the Savage Land  he attempted to unleash chaos upon the sanctuary  but was killed by Nightcrawler  who teleported his head off his body and hid it in a crater  46   edit  Marvel Zombies In the first Marvel Zombies limited series  a zombie version of Deadpool is seen fighting the Silver Surfer  The zombie Deadpool eventually loses his body and appears as a disembodied head beginning in Marvel Zombies 3  This incarnation of Deadpool  frequently referred to as Headpool  entered the mainstream Marvel continuity when he is encountered and captured by the original Deadpool in Deadpool  Merc with a Mouth  47  Along with several other alternate versions of Deadpool  Headpool went on to appear in Deadpool Corps with a propeller beanie mounted to his head  allowing him to fly and fight  48   edit  Deadpool  Merc with a Mouth Several alternate incarnations of Deadpool are introduced in the series Deadpool  Merc with a Mouth  Attempting to return Headpool to the Marvel Zombies universe  Deadpool encounters multiple versions of himself as they exist in other universes  including a female version of himself named Lady Deadpool  Major Wade Wilson  a militant but sane version of Deadpool  and The Deadpool Kid  a cowboy version of Deadpool who exists within a universe resembling the Wild West  49   edit  Deadpool Corps In the twelve issue series Deadpool Corps and prequel series Prelude to Deadpool Corps  Deadpool is joined by several alternate versions of himself from different universes to create a super group  Lady Deadpool and Headpool return from their previous appearances in Deadpool  Merc with a Mouth  joined by newcomers Kidpool  a child version of Deadpool who attends Professor X s school  50  and Dogpool  a dog endowed with Deadpool s familiar healing factor  51   edit  Marvel 2997 In Messiah War Deadpool helps Cable to get Hope Summers back from Stryfe who is later revealed to be inside this version of Deadpool s head  After seemingly defeating Stryfe  this version of Deadpool is quickly ripped in half and appears to die shortly after  his last words being a joke on  severance  pay  52   edit  Weapon X  Days of Future Present In the alternate Earth ending of the Weapon X comic  Deadpool is recruited by Wolverine to be part of a new team of X Men after the old team is killed  He joins  claiming Wolverine only wants him as the  token human   This version of Deadpool is killed by Agent Zero s Anti Healing Factor corrosive acid  This version of Deadpool speaks in white text boxes  53   edit  Hulked Out Heroes Main article  Hulked Out Heroes Appearing first in Hulk  21  Deadpool is  hulked out  near the end of the Fall of the Hulks storyline  A two part mini series called  World War Hulks  Hulked Out Heroes will follow Hulkpool as he travels back in time to kill himself  54   edit  Captain America  Who Won t Wield the Shield A World War II era version of Deadpool is introduced in the one shot parody issue Captain America  Who Won t Wield the Shield  Frederick  Wheezy  Wilson  nephew of President Woodrow Wilson  is a soldier who is experimented on by the Nazis to become  Veapon X   Despite the nature of the story as a period piece  Wilson peppers his speech with anachronistic slang from the 1990s  55  56   edit  Superman Batman The first Superman Batman annual published by DC comics features the appearance of an alternate reality version of Deathstroke the Terminator who bears the mannerisms of Deadpool  and his attempts to identify himself by name are continually interrupted violently  57   edit  Deadpool Pulp Deadpool Pulp is a four issue limited series from writers Mike Benson and Adam Glass and artist Laurence Campbell  with Deadpool set in the 1950s drawing on pulp fiction  similar to the Marvel Noir fictional universe   58   edit  In other media  edit  Television While Deadpool never had a speaking role in the X Men animated series  he made several cameo appearances throughout the series in various episodes  He appears in a flashback sequence alongside Wolverine in one of Sabretooth s mental sessions with Professor Xavier in the episode  Deadly Reunions   In the episode  Whatever it Takes   Morph shape shifts into Deadpool s form  and the character makes a similar appearance by proxy when Xavier s dark side projected an image of Deadpool to attack Wolverine in the episode  Dark Shroud   At the time before the cancellation of Wolverine and the X Men was announced  a proposed season two was in the works which would have included Deadpool being sent by Weapon X to bring in Wolverine  Nolan North was cast for his voice  59  Deadpool has a brief cameo in the Marvel Anime  X Men episode  Destiny   60   edit  Film Deadpool appears in the animated film Hulk Vs Wolverine 61  voiced by Nolan North  62  Deadpool acts as one of Professor Thorton s henchmen  alongside Lady Deathstrike  Omega Red  and Sabretooth  in the Weapon X program  seeking to capture Wolverine and the Hulk in order to brainwash them and convert them into the ultimate weapons  63  Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson Deadpool in X Men Origins  Wolverine  Deadpool is one of the primary antagonists of the film X Men Origins  Wolverine  portrayed by Ryan Reynolds  64  He is a highly skilled  wisecracking but greatly amoral mercenary who wields a pair of katanas with superhuman speed and skill sufficient to deflect fully automatic weapons fire  He is supposedly killed by Sabretooth  but is later revealed to have been transformed by Colonel William Stryker into Weapon XI  stunts portrayed by Scott Adkins   a mutant killer who possesses other mutants  powers  including Scott Summers  optic blasts  John Wraith s teleportation  Chris Bradley s technopathy  Wolverine s healing factor  and a pair of extendable blades resembling Wilson s prized swords  He is referred to by Stryker as  the Deadpool  because the compatible powers of the other mutants have been  pooled  together into one being  Wolverine and Sabretooth fight Deadpool in the film s climax and manage to defeat him by decapitating him and sending him falling into a cooling tower of a nuclear power plant  although a post credits scene appearing in DVD releases and some theatrical presentations of the film implies Deadpool is still alive  65  A spin off of X Men Origins  Wolverine starring Deadpool is in development  and Reynolds is attached to reprise his role  66  According to Empire  a script is in development  and Deadpool will  break the fourth wall  during the film  67 Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese have been attached to write the script for the film  68  On April 8  2011  Tim Miller was hired to direct the film  69  Originally the film was set to be rated PG 13  but the rating was later reconsidered with the possible addition of gore  70   edit  Video games Deadpool appears in X Men Legends II  Rise of Apocalypse voiced by John Kassir  Deadpool initially appears as a boss  having been hired and brainwashed by Mister Sinister  He fights the united X Men and Brotherhood in the New York City s North Side during Act 4  Deadpool is also unlocked as a playable character once the game is completed for the first time  As in the comics  Deadpool breaks the fourth wall if the player stalls enough  If the enemy Deadpool is fought using the playable Deadpool  they will argue about which one is the real Deadpool  71  In Marvel  Ultimate Alliance  Deadpool is a playable character from the beginning of the game with John Kassir reprising speaking role from X Men Legends II  He can take on multiple costumes  including outfits based on his classic appearance  his appearance in the Ultimate Universe  his appearance from the Deadpool  Agent of Weapon X arc  and an updated version of the costume used in Cable and Deadpool  Deadpool frequently breaks the fourth wall referencing the game itself and parodying other Marvel Comics heroes  He recounts his origin story in a briefing for his simulator mission  initially as a humorous pastiche of the origins of Thor  Blade  Daredevil  Storm  and the Hulk before proceeding to tell his real origin  72  Deadpool appears in the video game adaptation of X Men Origins  Wolverine voiced by Steven Blum  Deadpool appears as a playable character in Marvel  Ultimate Alliance 2 again voiced by John Kassir  His unmasked Ultimate Marvel appearance serves as an alternative costume  In the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions  he appears as a boss in the game s third stage  but will join the party upon his defeat when he realizes that the heroes aren t part of Titanium Man s terrorist attack  In keeping with his previous appearance  Deadpool has been written so that he is fully aware of his presence in a video game  and his dialogue throughout the title reflects this insight  for example  if the player chooses to enlist him in the Anti Registration team  he quips to Maria Hill the possibility of being Pro Registration  in the next playthrough    73  74  75  76  Also during the credits  Deadpool confronts one of the writers with a complaint about the game not starring him  In the Wii  PSP  and PS2 versions  he is playable from the start and appears during the credit sequence and load screens watching television while sitting in a recliner  Ultimate Deadpool appears as a villain in Spider Man  Shattered Dimensions voiced by Nolan North  reprising his speaking role from Hulk vs Wolverine  77  This version of Deadpool incorporates traits from his mainstream counterpart such as breaking the fourth wall  a teleportation device  and an implied healing factor  Instead of leading an army of Reavers as he does in the Ultimate universe he uses an army of weapon wielding fanboys and robots  He lures and fights Ultimate Spider Man on an oil platform as part of his newest game show called Pain Factor when he learns what the tablet actually is and uses it to make two copies of himself  78  Deadpool appears as a playable fighter in Marvel vs  Capcom 3  Fate of Two Worlds  voiced again by Nolan North  His abilities include use of his guns  swords  and teleporter  which will malfunction if used excessively  He performs his own anomalous version of the Shoryuken  and again breaks the fourth wall  with a special move in which he beats his opponent with his health bar and his hyper combo bar  79  He is frequently featured opposite of Capcom s Dante from the Devil May Cry series  80  His victory sequences have him approach the camera and say various things to the player  In Deadpool s ending sequence  he throws a party to celebrate his defeat of Galactus  but his actions inadvertently cause the destruction of Cleveland  Ohio  for which he implicates the player  Deadpool later appears as a playable character in the standalone updated version of the game  Ultimate Marvel vs  Capcom 3  Deadpool is a playable character in Marvel Super Hero Squad Online  81   edit  Collected editions See also  Cable  amp  Deadpool Collected editions The stories have been collected in a number of trade
