Hebrew         HaShoah   catastrophe   Yiddish         Churben or Hurban  3  from the Hebrew for  destruction    was the genocide of approximately six million European Jews during World War II  a programme of systematic state sponsored murder by Nazi Germany  led by Adolf Hitler  throughout Nazi occupied territory  4  Of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe before the Holocaust  approximately two thirds perished  5  In particular  over one million Jewish children were killed in the Holocaust  as were approximately two million Jewish women and three million Jewish men  6  7  Some scholars maintain that the definition of the Holocaust should also include the Nazis  genocide of millions of people in other groups  including Romani  Soviet prisoners of war  Polish and Soviet civilians  homosexuals  people with disabilities  Jehovah s Witnesses and other political and religious opponents  which occurred regardless of whether they were of German or non German ethnic origin  8  Using this definition  the total number of Holocaust victims is between 11 million and 17 million people  9  The persecution and genocide were carried out in stages  Various legislation to remove the Jews from civil society  predominantly the Nuremberg Laws  was enacted in Nazi Germany years before the outbreak of World War II  Concentration camps were established in which inmates were used as slave labor until they died of exhaustion or disease  Where the Third Reich conquered new territory in eastern Europe  specialized units called Einsatzgruppen murdered Jews and political opponents in mass shootings  The Third Reich required Jews and Romani to be confined in overcrowded ghettos before being transported by freight train to extermination camps where  if they survived the journey  the majority of them were systematically killed in gas chambers  Every arm of Nazi Germany s bureaucracy was involved in the logistics that led to the genocides  turning the Third Reich into what one Holocaust scholar has called  a genocidal state   10  Opinions differ on how much the civilian population of Germany knew about the government conspiracy against the Jewish population  Most historians claim that the civilian population was unaware of the atrocities that were carried out  especially in the extermination camps  which were located outside of Germany in Nazi occupied Europe  The historian Robert Gellately  however  claims that the government openly announced the conspiracy through the media  and that civilians were aware of its every aspect except for the use of gas chambers  11  Significant historical evidence points to the idea that the vast majority of Holocaust victims  prior to their deportation to concentration camps  were either unaware of the fate that awaited them  or were in disbelief  they honestly believed that they were to be resettled  12  Contents 1 Etymology and use of the term 2 Distinctive features 2 1 Institutional collaboration 2 2 Ideology and scale

Miscellaneous 6 6 Related links 7 References 8 External links Etymology and use of the term Main article  Names of the Holocaust The term holocaust comes from the Greek word hol kauston  an animal sacrifice offered to a god in which the whole  holos  animal is completely burnt  kaustos   13  For hundreds of years  the word  holocaust  was used in English to denote great massacres  but since the 1960s  the term has come to be used by scholars and popular writers to refer exclusively to the genocide of Jews  4  The mini series Holocaust is credited with introducing the term into common parlance after 1978  14  The biblical word Shoah         also spelled Sho ah and Shoa   meaning  calamity   became the standard Hebrew term for the Holocaust as early as the 1940s  especially in Europe and Israel  15 Shoah is preferred by many Jews for a number of reasons  including the theologically offensive nature of the word  holocaust   which they take to refer to the Greek pagan custom  16  The Nazis used a euphemistic phrase  the  Final Solution to the Jewish Question   German  Endl sung der Judenfrage   and the phrase  Final Solution  has been widely used as a term for the genocide of the Jews subsequently  Nazis also used the phrase  Leben unwertes Leben   Life unworthy of life  in an attempt to justify the killings philosophically  Distinctive features Institutional collaboration Ghettos were established in Europe in which Jews were confined before being shipped to extermination camps  Michael Berenbaum writes that Germany became a  genocidal state   10   Every arm of the country s sophisticated bureaucracy was involved in the killing process  Parish churches and the Interior Ministry supplied birth records showing who was Jewish  the Post Office delivered the deportation and denaturalization orders  the Finance Ministry confiscated Jewish property  German firms fired Jewish workers and disenfranchised Jewish stockholders   The universities refused to admit Jews  denied degrees to those already studying  and fired Jewish academics  government transport offices arranged the trains for deportation to the camps  German pharmaceutical companies tested drugs on camp prisoners  companies bid for the contracts to build the crematoria  detailed lists of victims were drawn up using the Dehomag  IBM Germany  company s punch card machines  producing meticulous records of the killings  As prisoners entered the death camps  they were made to surrender all personal property  which was carefully catalogued and tagged before being sent to Germany to be reused or recycled  Berenbaum writes that the Final Solution of the Jewish question was  in the eyes of the perpetrators     Germany s greatest achievement   17  Saul Friedl nder writes that   Not one social group  not one religious community  not one scholarly institution or professional association in Germany and throughout Europe declared its solidarity with the Jews   18  He writes that some Christian churches declared that converted Jews should be regarded as part of the flock  but even then only up to a point  Friedl nder argues that this makes the Holocaust distinctive because antisemitic policies were able to unfold without the interference of countervailing forces of the kind normally found in advanced societies  such as industry  small businesses  churches  and other vested interests and lobby groups  18  Ideology and scale In other genocides  pragmatic considerations such as control of territory and resources were central to the genocide policy  Yehuda Bauer argues that  The basic motivation  of the Holocaust  was purely ideological  rooted in an illusionary world of Nazi imagination  where an international Jewish conspiracy to control the world was opposed to a parallel Aryan quest  No genocide to date had been based so completely on myths  on hallucinations  on abstract  nonpragmatic ideology   which was then executed by very rational  pragmatic means   19  Responding to the German philosopher Ernst Nolte  who claimed that the Holocaust was not unique  the German historian Eberhard J ckel wrote in 1986 that the Holocaust was unique because  the National Socialist killing of the Jews was unique in that never before had a state with the authority of its responsible leader decided and announced that a specific human group  including its aged  its women and its children and infants  would be killed as quickly as possible  and then carried through this resolution using every possible means of state power  20  The slaughter was systematically conducted in virtually all areas of Nazi occupied territory in what are now 35 separate European countries  21  It was at its worst in Central and Eastern Europe  which had more than seven million Jews in 1939  About five million Jews were killed there  including three million in occupied Poland and over one million in the Soviet Union  Hundreds of thousands also died in the Netherlands  France  Belgium  Yugoslavia and Greece  The Wannsee Protocol makes it clear that the Nazis intended to carry their  final solution of the Jewish question  to Britain and all the other neutral states in Europe  such as Ireland  Switzerland  Turkey  Sweden  Portugal and Spain  22  Anyone with three or four Jewish grandparents was to be exterminated without exception  In other genocides  people were able to escape death by converting to another religion or in some other way assimilating  This option was not available to the Jews of occupied Europe  23  unless their grandparents had converted before January 18  1871  All persons of recent Jewish ancestry were to be exterminated in lands controlled by Germany  24  Extermination camps Main article  Extermination camp The use of camps equipped with gas chambers for the purpose of systematic mass extermination of peoples was a unique feature of the Holocaust and unprecedented in history  Never before in history had there existed places with the express purpose of killing people en masse  Medical experiments Further information  Nazi human experimentation Romani children in Auschwitz  victims of medical experiments Another distinctive feature of the Holocaust was the extensive use of human subjects in medical experiments  German physicians carried out such experiments at Auschwitz  Dachau  Buchenwald  Ravensbr ck  Sachsenhausen and Natzweiler concentration camps  25  The most notorious of these physicians was Dr  Josef Mengele  who worked in Auschwitz  His experiments included placing subjects in pressure chambers  testing drugs on them  freezing them  attempting to change eye color by injecting chemicals into children s eyes and various amputations and other brutal surgeries  25  The full extent of his work will never be known because the truckload of records he sent to Dr  Otmar von Verschuer at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute was destroyed by von Verschuer  26  Subjects who survived Mengele s experiments were almost always killed and dissected shortly afterwards  He seemed particularly keen on working with Romani children  He would bring them sweets and toys  and personally take them to the gas chamber  They would call him  Onkel Mengele   27  Vera Alexander was a Jewish inmate at Auschwitz who looked after 50 sets of Romani twins  I remember one set of twins in particular  Guido and Ina  aged about four  One day  Mengele took them away  When they returned  they were in a terrible state  they had been sewn together  back to back  like Siamese twins  Their wounds were infected and oozing pus  They screamed day and night  Then their parents   I remember the mother s name was Stella   managed to get some morphine and they killed the children in order to end their suffering  27  Development and execution Origins See also  Antisemitism  Christianity and antisemitism  Martin Luther and antisemitism  and Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses At 10 a m  on April 1  1933  members of the Sturmabteilung moved into place all over Germany  positioning themselves outside Jewish owned businesses to deter customers  These stormtroopers are outside Israel s Department Store in Berlin  The signs read   Germans  Defend yourselves  Don t buy from Jews     Deutsche  Wehrt Euch  Kauft nicht bei Juden    28  The store was ransacked during Kristallnacht in 1938  then handed over to a non Jewish family  Yehuda Bauer  Raul Hilberg and Lucy Dawidowicz maintained that from the Middle Ages onward  German society and culture were suffused with anti Semitism  and that there was a direct link from medieval pogroms to the Nazi death camps  29  30  31  The second half of the 19th century saw the emergence in Germany and Austria Hungary of the so called V lkisch movement  which as developed by such thinkers as Houston Stewart Chamberlain and Paul de Lagarde  presented a pseudo scientific  biologically based racism that saw Jews as a  race  locked into mortal combat with the  Aryan  race for world domination  32 V lkisch anti Semitism  though drawing upon stereotypes from Christian anti Semitism  differed from the latter in that Jews were considered to be a  race  rather than a religion  33  In 1895  one of the v lkisch leaders  Hermann Ahlwardt  in a speech before the Reichstag  called Jews  predators  and  cholera bacilli  who should be  exterminated  for the good of the German people  34  In his best selling 1912 book Wenn ich der Kaiser w r  If I were the Kaiser   Heinrich Class  the leader of one of the more powerful v lkisch groups  the Alldeutscher Verband  urged that all German Jews be stripped of their German citizenship and be reduced to Fremdenrecht  alien status   35  Class also urged that Jews be excluded from all aspects of German life  forbidden to own land  hold public office  or participate in journalism  banking  and the liberal professions  35  Class defined a Jew as anyone  regardless of their religion  whose grandparents or parents were Jews in 1871  35  The British historian of modern Germany Richard J  Evans wrote that during the Imperial period in German history  v lkisch and scientific racist ideas had become very common and accepted in many quarters in Germany  36  Though the v lkisch parties suffered a crushing defeat in the 1912 Reichstag elections  being all but wiped out  this had less to do with the unpopularity of their anti Semitism than the way the mainstream German parties had incorporated it into their own platforms which helps to explain why Nazi anti Semitism created so little opposition during the Weimar Republic  37  The National Socialist German Workers  Party was founded in 1919 as an offshoot of the v lkisch movement  and adopted their anti Semitism  38  In a 1986 essay  the German historian Hans Mommsen wrote about the situation in post World War I Germany that  If one emphasizes the indisputably important connection in isolation  one should not then force a connection with Hitler s weltanschauung  worldview   which was in no ways original itself  in order to deprive from it the existence of Auschwitz     Thoughts about the extermination of the Jews had long been current  and not only for Hitler and his satraps  Many of these found their way to the NSDAP from the Deutschv lkisch Schutz und Trutzbund  German Racial Union for Protection and Defiance   which itself had been called into life by the Pan German Union  39  The tremendous scientific and technological changes in Germany of the late 19th and early 20th centuries  together with the growth of the welfare state  created widespread hopes that  utopia  was at hand and that soon all social problems could be solved  40  At the same time  owing to the great prestige of science  a scientific racist  social Darwinist and eugenicist world view which declared some people to be more biologically  valuable  than others was common amongst German elites  41  The historian Detlev Peukert in his 1989 essay  The Genesis of the  Final Solution  from the Spirit of Science  declared that the Shoah was not the result solely of anti Semitism  but was instead a product of the  cumulative radicalization  in which  numerous smaller currents  fed into the  broad current  that led to genocide  42  After the First World War  the pre war mood of optimism gave way to disillusionment as German bureaucrats found social problems to be more insoluble than previously thought  which in turn led them to place increasing emphasis on saving the biologically  fit  while the biologically  unfit  were to be written off  43  The economic strains caused by the Great Depression had led to many in the German medical establishment to advocate with increasing vigor the idea of selective killings of the  incurable  mentally and physically disabled as a cost saving measure in order to free up money to care for the curable  44  Thus by the time the Nazis had come to power in 1933  a huge boost was given to the already existing tendency in German social policy to save the racially  valuable  while seeking to rid society of the racially  undesirable   45  The persecution and exodus of Germany s 525 000 Jews began almost as soon as the Nazis came to power on January 30  1933  In Mein Kampf  Hitler had been open about his hatred of Jews  and gave ample warning of his intention to drive them from Germany s political  intellectual  and cultural life  He did not write that he would attempt to exterminate them  but he is reported to have been more explicit in private  As early as 1922  he allegedly told Major Joseph Hell  at the time a journalist  Once I really am in power  my first and foremost task will be the annihilation of the Jews  As soon as I have the power to do so  I will have gallows built in rows   at the Marienplatz in Munich  for example   as many as traffic allows  Then the Jews will be hanged indiscriminately  and they will remain hanging until they stink  they will hang there as long as the principles of hygiene permit  As soon as they have been untied  the next batch will be strung up  and so on down the line  until the last Jew in Munich has been exterminated  Other cities will follow suit  precisely in this fashion  until all Germany has been completely cleansed of Jews  46  The German historian Hans Mommsen claimed that there were three types of anti Semitism in Germany  One should differentiate between the cultural antisemitism symptomatic of the German conservatives   found especially in the German officer corps and the high civil administration   and mainly directed against the Eastern Jews on the one hand  and v lkisch antisemitism on the other  The conservative variety functions  as Shulamit Volkov has pointed out  as something of a  cultural code   This variety of German antisemitism later on played a significant role insofar as it prevented the functional elite from distancing itself from the repercussions of racial antisemitism  Thus  there was almost no relevant protest against the Jewish persecution on the part of the generals or the leading groups within the Reich government  This is especially true with respect to Hitler s proclamation of the  racial annihilation war  against the Soviet Union  Besides conservative antisemitism  there existed in Germany a rather silent anti Judaism within the Catholic Church  which had a certain impact on immunising the Catholic population against the escalating persecution  The famous protest of the Catholic Church against the euthanasia program was  therefore  not accompanied by any protest against the Holocaust  The third and most vitriolic variety of antisemitism in Germany  and elsewhere  is the so called v lkisch antisemitism or racism  and this is the foremost advocate of using violence  Anyhow  one has to be aware that even Hitler until 1938 and possibly 1939 still relied on enforced emigration to get rid of German Jewry  and there did not yet exist any clear cut concept of killing them  This  however  does not mean that the Nazis elsewhere on all levels did not hesitate to use violent methods  and the inroads against Jews  Jewish shops  and institutions show that very clearly  But there did not exist any formal annihilation program until the second year of the war  It came into being after the  reservation  projects had failed  That  however  does not mean that those methods did not include a lethal component  47  Legal repression and emigration Further information  Anti Jewish legislation in prewar Nazi Germany  Racial policy of Nazi Germany  Nuremberg Laws  and Haavara Agreement Right from the beginning of the Third Reich  Nazi leaders had proclaimed the existence of a Volksgemeinschaft  People s Community   Nazi policies divided the population into two categories  the Volksgenossen   National Comrades   who belonged to the Volksgemeinschaft and the Gemeinschaftsfremde   Community Aliens   who did not  Nazi policies about repression divided into three types of enemies  the  racial  enemies such as the Jews and the Gypsies who were viewed as enemies because of their  blood   political opponents such as Marxists  liberals  Christians and the  reactionaries  who were viewed as wayward  National Comrades   and moral opponents such as homosexuals  the  work shy  and habitual criminals  also seen as wayward  National Comrades   48  The last two groups were to be sent to concentration camps for  re education   with the aim of eventual absorption into the Volksgemeinschaft  though some of the moral opponents were to be sterilized as they were regarded as  genetically inferior    48  Racial  enemies such as the Jews could  by definition  never belong to the Volksgemeinschaft  thus requiring their total removal from society  48  The German historian Detlev Peukert wrote that the National Socialists   goal was an utopian Volksgemeinschaft  totally under police surveillance  in which any attempt at nonconformist behaviour  or even any hint or intention of such behaviour  would be visited with terror   49  In support of this  Peukert quoted policy documents on the  Treatment of Community Aliens  from 1944  which  though never implemented  showed the full intentions of Nazi social policy   persons who     show themselves  to be  unable to comply by their own efforts with the minimum requirements of the national community  were to be placed under police supervision  and if this did not reform them  they were to be taken to a concentration camp  50  Jewish refugees from Czechoslovakia being marched away by British police at Croydon airport in March 1939  They were put on a flight to Warsaw  Leading up to the March 1933 Reichstag elections  the Nazis intensified their campaign of violence against the opposition  With the co operation of local authorities  they set up concentration camps for extrajudicial imprisonment of their opponents  One of the first was Dachau  which opened in March 1933  These early camps were meant for political prisoners only  such as Communists and Social Democrats  and were not killing centres like the latter death camps  51  Other early prisons   for example  basements and storehouses run by the SA and less commonly by SS    were consolidated by mid 1934 into purpose built camps outside the cities  exclusively run by the SS  The main purposes of the concentration camps was to serve as a deterrent by terrorizing those Germans who were unable or unwilling to join the Volksgemeinschaft in conformity 52  Those sent to the concentration camps were in turn divided into the  educable  whose wills could be broken into becoming  National Comrades  and the  biologically depraved  were to be sterilized  were to be held permanently  and over time were increasingly subject to  annihilation through labour   i e  being worked to death  52  Throughout the 1930s  the legal  economic  and social rights of Jews were steadily restricted  In legally defining who is Jew  the Nazis considered anyone of Jewish descent  even the descendants of converts who converted from Judaism after January 18  1871   the founding of the German Empire  were still considered Jews  The Israeli historian Saul Friedl nder writes that  for the Nazis  Germany drew its strength for its  purity of blood  and its  rootedness in the sacred German earth   53  On April 1  1933  there occurred boycott of Jewish businesses  which was the first national anti Semitic campaign  initially planned for a week  but called off after one day owing to lack of popular support  In 1933  a series of laws were passed which contained  Aryan paragraphs  to exclude Jews from key areas  the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service  the first anti Semitic law passed in the Third Reich  the Physicians  Law  and the Farm Law  forbidding Jews from owning farms or taking part in agriculture  Jewish lawyers were disbarred  and in Dresden  Jewish lawyers and judges were dragged out of their offices and courtrooms  and beaten  54  At the insistence of then president Hindenburg  Hitler added an exemption allowing Jewish civil servants who were veterans of the First World War  or whose fathers or sons had served  to remain in office  Hitler revoked this exemption in 1937  Jews were excluded from schools and universities  the Law to Prevent Overcrowding in Schools   from belonging to the Journalists  Association  and from being owners or editors of newspapers  53  The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung of April 27  1933 wrote  A self respecting nation cannot  on a scale accepted up to now  leave its higher activities in the hands of people of racially foreign origin     Allowing the presence of too high a percentage of people of foreign origin in relation to their percentage in the general population could be interpreted as an acceptance of the superiority of other races  something decidedly to be rejected  55  In July 1933  the Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring calling for compulsory sterilization of the  inferior  was passed  This major eugenic policy led to over 200 Hereditary Health Courts  Erbgesundheitsgerichte  being set up  under whose rulings over 400 000 people were sterilized against their will during the Nazi period  56  1935  Nazi definition of Jew  Mischling  and German and legal consequences as per the Nuremberg Laws  simplified in a 1935 chart In 1935  Hitler introduced the Nuremberg Laws  which  prohibited Jews from marrying or having sex with  Aryans   the Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honor   stripped German Jews of their citizenship and deprived them of all civil rights  In his speech introducing the laws  Hitler said that if the  Jewish problem  cannot be solved by these laws  it  must then be handed over by law to the National Socialist Party for a final solution  Endl sung    57  The expression  Endl sung  became the standard Nazi euphemism for the extermination of the Jews  In January 1939  he said in a public speech   If international finance Jewry inside and outside Europe should succeed once more in plunging the nations into yet another world war  the consequences will not be the Bolshevization of the earth and thereby the victory of Jewry  but the annihilation  vernichtung  of the Jewish race in Europe   58  Footage from this speech was used to conclude the 1940 Nazi propaganda movie The Eternal Jew  Der ewige Jude   whose purpose was to provide a rationale and blueprint for eliminating the Jews from Europe  59  Jewish intellectuals were among the first to leave  The philosopher Walter Benjamin left for Paris on March 18  1933  Novelist Leon Feuchtwanger went to Switzerland  The conductor Bruno Walter fled after being told that the hall of the Berlin Philharmonic would be burned down if he conducted a concert there  the Frankfurter Zeitung explained on April 6 that Walter and fellow conductor Otto Klemperer had been forced to flee because the government was unable to protect them against the mood of the German public  which had been provoked by  Jewish artistic liquidators   60 Albert Einstein was visiting the U S  on January 30  1933  He returned to Ostende in Belgium  never to set foot in Germany again  and calling events there a  psychic illness of the masses   he was expelled from the Kaiser Wilhelm Society and the Prussian Academy of Sciences  and his citizenship was rescinded  61  When the Nazis annexed Austria in 1938  Sigmund Freud and his family fled from Vienna to England  Saul Friedl nder writes that when Max Liebermann  honorary president of the Prussian Academy of Arts  resigned his position  not one of his colleagues expressed a word of sympathy  and he was still ostracized at his death two years later  When the police arrived in 1943 with a stretcher to deport his 85 year old bedridden widow  she committed suicide with an overdose of barbiturates rather than be taken  61  Kristallnacht  1938  Main article  Kristallnacht On November 7  1938  Jewish minor Herschel Gr nspan assassinated Nazi German diplomat Ernst vom Rath in Paris  62  This incident was used by the Nazis as a pretext to go beyond legal repression to large scale physical violence against Jewish Germans  What the Nazis claimed to be spontaneous  public outrage  was in fact a wave of pogroms instigated by the Nazi party  and carried out by SA members and affiliates throughout Nazi Germany  at the time consisting of Germany proper  Austria and Sudetenland  62  These pogroms became known as Reichskristallnacht   the Night of Broken Glass   literally  Crystal Night    or November pogroms  Jews were attacked and Jewish property was vandalized  over 7 000 Jewish shops and 1 668 synagogues  almost every synagogue in Germany  were damaged or destroyed  The death toll is assumed to be much higher than the official number of 91 dead  62  30 000 were sent to concentration camps  including Dachau  Sachsenhausen  Buchenwald  and Oranienburg concentration camp  63  where they were kept for several weeks  and released when they could either prove that they were about to emigrate in the near future  or transferred their property to the Nazis  64  Coinciding with Kristallnacht was the November 11  1938 passage of Regulations Against Jews  Possession of Weapons  which made it illegal for Jews to possess firearms or other weapons  see The 1938 German Weapons Act   65  German Jewry was collectively made responsible for restitution of the material damage of the pogroms  amounting to several hundred thousand Reichsmarks  and furthermore had to pay an  atonement tax  of more than a billion Reichsmarks  62  After these pogroms  Jewish emigration from Nazi Germany accelerated  while public Jewish life in Germany ceased to exist  62  Resettlement and deportation Before the war  the Nazis considered mass exportation of German  and subsequently the European  Jewry from Europe  Plans to reclaim former German colonies such as Tanganyika and South West Africa for Jewish resettlement were halted by Hitler  who argued that no place where  so much blood of heroic Germans had been spilled  should be made available as a residence for the  worst enemies of the Germans   66  Diplomatic efforts were undertaken to convince the other former colonial powers  primarily the United Kingdom and France  to accept expelled Jews in their colonies  67  Areas considered for possible resettlement included British Palestine  68  Italian Abyssinia  68  British Rhodesia  69  French Madagascar  68  and Australia  70  Of these areas  Madagascar was the most seriously discussed  Heydrich called the Madagascar Plan a  territorial final solution   it was a remote location  and the island s unfavorable conditions would hasten deaths  71  In retrospect  although futile  this plan did constitute an important psychological step on the path to the Holocaust  72  Approved by Hitler in 1938  the resettlement planning was carried out by Eichmann s office  only being abandoned once the mass killing of Jews began in 1941  The end of the Madagascar Plan was announced on February 10  1942  The German Foreign Office was given the official explanation that  due to the war with the Soviet Union  Jews were to be  sent to the east   73  Palestine was the only location to which any Nazi relocation plan succeeded in producing significant results  by means of an agreement begun in 1933 between the Zionist Federation of Germany  die Zionistische Vereinigung f r Deutschland  and the Nazi government  the Haavara Agreement  This agreement resulted in the transfer of about 60 000 German Jews and  100 million from Germany to Palestine  up until the outbreak of World War II  74  Early

Germany 1941  including areas annexed from Poland and the General Government area  The question of the treatment of the Jews became an urgent one for the Nazis after September 1939  when they invaded the western half of Poland  home to about two million Jews  The pre war Second Polish Republic had been divided between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union  in the preceding Molotov Ribbentrop Pact  Of the German share of Poland  the north western parts were annexed  while the south eastern parts were made the General Government  administered by Hans Frank  The invasion led Britain  Australia  New Zealand  Canada  South Africa  and France to declare war World War II had started  Himmler s right hand man  Reinhard Heydrich  recommended concentrating all the Polish Jews in ghettos in major cities  where they would be put to work for the German war industry  The ghettos would be in cities located on railway junctions  so that  in Heydrich s words   future measures can be accomplished more easily   75  During his interrogation in 1961  Adolf Eichmann testified that the expression  future measures  was understood to mean  physical extermination   75    I ask nothing of the Jews except that they should disappear     Hans Frank  Nazi governor of Poland  76  German policemen tormenting a Jew in Rzesz w  Poland  In September  Himmler appointed Heydrich head of the Reich Main Security Office  Reichssicherheitshauptamt or RSHA  not be to confused with the RuSHA   This body was to oversee the work of the SS  the Security Police  SD   and the Gestapo in occupied Poland  and carry out the policy towards the Jews described in Heydrich s report  The first organized murders of Jews by German forces occurred during Operation Tannenberg and through Selbstschutz units  Later  the Jews were herded into ghettos  mostly in the General Government area of central Poland  where they were put to work under the Reich Labor Office headed by Fritz Sauckel  Here many thousands died from maltreatment  disease  starvation  and exhaustion  but there was still no program of systematic killing  There is no doubt  however  that the Nazis saw forced labor as a form of extermination  The expression Vernichtung durch Arbeit   destruction through work   was frequently used  Further information  Jewish ghettos in German occupied Poland Although it was clear by 1941 that the SS hierarchy was determined to embark on a policy of killing all the Jews under German control  there was still opposition to this policy within the Nazi regime  although the motive was economic  not humanitarian  Hermann G ring  who had overall control of the German war industry  and the German army s Economics Department  argued that the enormous Jewish labor force assembled in the General Government area  more than a million able bodied workers  was an asset too valuable to waste while Germany was preparing to invade the Soviet Union  In other occupied countries When Nazi Germany occupied Norway  the Netherlands  Luxembourg  Belgium  and France in 1940  and Yugoslavia and Greece in 1941  anti Semitic measures were also introduced into these countries  although the pace and severity varied greatly from country to country according to local political circumstances  Jews were removed from economic and cultural life and were subject to various restrictive laws  but physical deportation did not occur in most places before 1942  The Vichy regime in occupied France actively collaborated in persecuting French Jews  Germany s allies Italy  Hungary  Romania  Bulgaria and Finland were pressured to introduce antisemitic measures  but for the most part they did not comply until compelled to do so  During the course of the war some 900 Jews and 300 Roma passed through the concentration camp Banjica in Belgrade  intended primarily for Serbian communists  royalists and other patriots who resisted occupation  The German puppet regime in Croatia  on the other hand  began actively persecuting Jews on its own initiative  so the Legal Decree on the Nationalization of the Property of Jews and Jewish Companies was declared on October 10  1941 in the Independent State of Croatia  General Government and Lublin reservation  Nisko plan  Main articles  Nisko Plan and General Government  The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland   report by the Republic of Poland addressed to United Nations  1942 On September 28  1939  Germany gained control over the Lublin area through the German Soviet agreement in exchange for Lithuania  77  According to the Nisko Plan  they set up the Lublin Lipowa Reservation in the area  The reservation was designated by Adolf Eichmann  who was assigned the task of removing all Jews from Germany  Austria and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia  78  They shipped the first Jews to Lublin less than three weeks later on October 18  1939  The first train loads consisted of Jews deported from Austria and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia  79  By January 30  1940  a total of 78 000 Jews had been deported to Lublin from Germany  Austria and Czechoslovakia  80  On 12 and February 13  1940  the Pomeranian Jews were deported to the Lublin reservation  resulting in Pomeranian Gauleiter Franz Schwede Coburg to be the first to declare his Gau  judenrein    free of Jews    81  On March 24  1940 Hermann G ring put the Nisko Plan on hold  and abandoned it entirely by the end of April  82  By the time the Nisko Plan was stopped  the total number of Jews who had been transported to Nisko had reached 95 000  many of whom had died from starvation  83  In July 1940  due to the difficulties of supporting the increased population in the General Government  Hitler had the deportations temporarily halted  84  In October 1940  Gauleiters Josef B rckel and Robert Heinrich Wagner oversaw Operation B rckel  the expulsion of the Jews into unoccupied France from their Gaues and the parts of Alsace Lorraine that had been annexed that summer to the Reich  85  Only those Jews in mixed marriages were not expelled  85  The 6 500 Jews affected by Operation B rckel were given at most two hours warning on the night of October 22 23  1940  before being rounded up  The nine trains carrying the deported Jews crossed over into France  without any warning to the French authorities   who were not happy to receive them  85  The deportees had not been allowed to take any of their possessions with them  these being confiscated by the German authorities  85  The German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop treated the ensuing complaints by the Vichy government over the expulsions in a  most dilatory fashion   85  As a result  the Jews expelled in Operation B rckel were interned in harsh conditions by the Vichy authorities at the camps in Gurs  Rivesaltes and Les Milles while awaiting a chance to return them to Germany  85  During 1940 and 1941  murder of large numbers of Jews in German occupied Poland continued  and the deportation of Jews to the General Government was undertaken  The deportation of Jews from Germany  particularly Berlin  was not officially completed until 1943   Many Berlin Jews were able to survive in hiding   By December 1939  3 5 million Jews were crowded into the General Government area  Concentration and labor camps  1933 1945  Further information  Nazi concentration camps  List of Nazi concentration camps  and Extermination through labor April 12  1945  Lager Nordhausen  where 20 000 inmates are believed to have died  From the beginning of the Third Reich concentration camps were founded  initially as places of incarceration  Though the death rate in the concentration camps was high  with a mortality rate of 50   they were not designed to be killing centres   By 1942  six large extermination camps had been established in Nazi occupied Poland  51  which were built solely for mass killings   After 1939  the camps increasingly became places where Jews and POWs were either killed or made to work as slave laborers  undernourished and tortured  86  It is estimated that the Germans established 15 000 camps and subcamps in the occupied countries  mostly in eastern Europe  87  88  New camps were founded in areas with large Jewish  Polish intelligentsia  communist  or Roma and Sinti populations  including inside Germany  The transportation of prisoners was often carried out under horrifying conditions using rail freight cars  in which many died before reaching their destination  Extermination through labour was a policy of systematic extermination   camp inmates would literally be worked to death  or worked to physical exhaustion  when they would be gassed or shot  Slave labour was used in war production  for example producing V 2 rockets at Mittelbau Dora  and various armaments around the Mauthausen Gusen concentration camp complex  Upon admission  some camps tattooed prisoners with a prisoner ID  89  Those fit for work were dispatched for 12 to 14 hour shifts  Before and after  there were roll calls that could sometimes last for hours  with prisoners regularly dying of exposure  90  Ghettos  1940 1945  Main articles  Ghettos in occupied Europe 1939

Nazis established ghettos in which Jews and some Romani were confined  until they were eventually shipped to extermination camps to be murdered  The Warsaw Ghetto was the largest  with 380 000 people  and the   d  Ghetto the second largest  holding 160 000  They were  in effect  immensely crowded prisons  described by Michael Berenbaum as instruments of  slow  passive murder   91  Though the Warsaw Ghetto contained 400 000 people 30  of the population of Warsaw it occupied only 2 4  of the city s area  averaging 9 2 people per room  92  From 1940 through 1942  starvation and disease  especially typhoid  killed hundreds of thousands  Over 43 000 residents of the Warsaw ghetto died there in 1941  92  more than one in ten  in Theresienstadt  more than half the residents died in 1942  91    The Germans came  the police  and they started banging houses   Raus  raus  raus  Juden raus        O ne baby started to cry     The other baby started crying  So the mother urinated in her hand and gave

his experience in the Kovno Ghetto  93  Each ghetto was run by a Judenrat  Jewish council  of German appointed Jewish community leaders  who were responsible for the day to day running of the ghetto  including the distribution of food  water  heat  medicine  and shelter  and who were also expected to make arrangements for deportations to extermination camps  Himmler ordered the start of the deportations on July 19  1942  and three days later  on July 22  the deportations from the Warsaw Ghetto began  over the next 52 days  until September 12  300 000 people from Warsaw alone were transported in freight trains to the Treblinka extermination camp  Many other ghettos were completely depopulated  Berenbaum writes that the defining moment that tested the courage and character of each Judenrat came when they were asked to provide a list of names of the next group to be deported  The Judenrat members went through the tried and tested methods of delay  bribery  stonewalling  pleading  and argumentation  until finally a decision had to be made  Some  like Chaim Rumkowski  argued that their responsibility was to save the Jews who could be saved  and that therefore others had to be sacrificed  others argued  following Maimonides  that not a single individual should be handed over who had not committed a capital crime  Judenrat leaders such as Dr  Joseph Parnas in Lviv  who refused to compile a list  were shot  On October 14  1942  the entire Judenrat of Byaroza committed suicide rather than cooperate with the deportations  94  The first ghetto uprising occurred in September 1942 in the small town of  achwa in south east Poland  Though there were armed resistance attempts in the larger ghettos in 1943  such as the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the Bia ystok Ghetto Uprising  in every case they failed against the overwhelming Nazi military force  and the remaining Jews were either killed or deported to the death camps  95  Pogroms  1939 1942  Main articles

the Nazis occupied Lithuania  where close to 80  of Lithuanian Jews were exterminated before the end of the year  97  98  The Soviet territories occupied by early 1942  including all of Belarus  Estonia  Latvia  Lithuania  Ukraine  and Moldova and most Russian territory west of the line Leningrad Moscow Rostov  contained about three million Jews  including hundreds of thousands who had fled Poland in 1939  Executions of Kiev Jews by German army mobile killing units  Einsatzgruppen  near Ivangorod in Ukraine  The photo was mailed from the Eastern Front to Germany and intercepted by a member of the Polish resistance  Members of the local populations in certain occupied Soviet territories participated actively in the killings of Jews and others  99  In Lithuania  Latvia and western Ukraine  locals were deeply involved in the murder of Jews from the very beginning of the German occupation  99  The Latvian Arajs Kommando was an example of an auxiliary unit involved in these killings  99  To the south  Ukrainians killed approximately 24 000 Jews  99  In addition  Latvian and Lithuanian units left their own countries  and committed murders of Jews in Belarus  and Ukrainians served as concentration and death camp guards in Poland  99 Usta e militia in Croatian areas also carried out acts of persecution and murder  Ultimately it was the Germans who organized and channelled these local participants in the Holocaust  99  Many of the mass killings were carried out in public  a change from previous practice  99  German witnesses to these killings emphasized the participation of the locals  99  The massacres committed by the Einsatzgruppen were usually justified under the grounds of anti partisan or anti bandit operations  but the German historian Andreas Hillgruber wrote that this was merely an excuse for the German Army s considerable involvement in the Holocaust in Russia and the terms  war crimes  and  crimes against humanity  were indeed correct labels for what happened  100  Hillgruber maintained that the slaughter of about 2 2 million defenceless men  women and children for the reasons of racist ideology cannot possibly be justified for any reason  and that those German generals who claimed that the Einsatzgruppen were a necessary anti partisan response were lying  101  An Einsatzgruppe D member about to shoot a Jew kneeling at a mass grave in Vinnitsa  Ukrainian SSR  Soviet Union  in 1942  The photograph is inscribed  The last Jew in Vinnitsa  Army co operation with the SS in anti partisan and anti Jewish operations was close and intensive  102  In the summer of 1941  the SS Cavalry Brigade commanded by Hermann Fegelein during the course of  anti partisan  operations in the Pripyat Marshes killed 699 Red Army soldiers  1 100 partisans and 14 178 Jews  102  Before the operation  Fegelein had been ordered to shoot all adult Jews while driving the women and children into the marshes  After the operation  General Max von Schenckendorff  who commanded the rear areas of Army Group Centre ordered on August 10  1941 that all Wehrmacht security divisions when on anti partisan duty to emulate Fegelein s example  and organized in Mogilev between September 24 26  1941 a joint SS Wehrmacht seminar on how best to murder Jews  102  The seminar ended with the 7th Company of Police Battalion 322 shooting 32 Jews at village called Knjashizy before the assembled officers as an example of how to  screen  the population for partisans  103  As the war diary of the Battalion 322 read  The action  first scheduled as a training exercise was carried out under real life conditions  ernstfallm ssig  in the village itself  Strangers  especially partisans could not be found  The screening of the population  however resulted in 13 Jews  27 Jewish women and 11 Jewish children  of which 13 Jews and 19 Jewish women were shot in co operation with the Security Service 103  Based on what they had learned during the Mogilev seminar  one Wehrmacht officer told his men  Where the partisan is  there is the Jew and where the Jew is  there is the partisan   103  In Order  24 of November 24  1941  the commander of the 707th division declared  Jews and Gypsies    As already has been ordered  the Jews have to vanish from the flat country and the Gypsies have to be annihilated too  The carrying out of larger Jewish actions is not the task of the divisional units  They are carried out by civilian or police authorities  if necessary ordered by the commandant of White Ruthenia  if he has special units at his disposal  or for security reasons and in the case of collective punishments  When smaller or larger groups of Jews are met in the flat country  they can be liquidated by divisional units or be massed in the ghettos near bigger villages designated for that purpose  where they can be handed over to the civilian authority or the SD  104  The German historian J rgen F rster  a leading expert on the subject of Wehrmacht war crimes argued the Wehrmacht played a key role in the Holocaust  and it is wrong to describe the Shoah as solely the work of the SS with the Wehrmacht as a passive and disapproving bystander  105  The mass murder of 2 749 Jews on the beach near the city of Liep ja  in Latvia  on December 15 through 17  1941  Raul Hilberg writes that the German Einsatzgruppen commanders were ordinary citizens  the great majority were university educated professionals  106  They used their skills to become efficient killers  according to Michael Berenbaum  107  The large scale killings of Jews in the occupied Soviet territories was assigned to SS formations called Einsatzgruppen   task groups    under the overall command of Heydrich  These had been used on a limited scale in Poland in 1939  but were now organized on a much larger scale  Einsatzgruppe A was assigned to the Baltic area  Einsatzgruppe B to Belarus  Einsatzgruppe C to north and central Ukraine  and Einsatzgruppe D to Moldova  south Ukraine  the Crimea  and  during 1942  the north Caucasus  108  According to Ohlendorf at his trial   the Einsatzgruppen had the mission to protect the rear of the troops by killing the Jews  Gypsies  Communist functionaries  active Communists  and all persons who would endanger the security   In practice  their victims were nearly all defenseless Jewish civilians  not a single Einsatzgruppe member was killed in action during these operations   By December 1941  the four Einsatzgruppen listed above had killed  respectively  125 000  45 000  75 000  and 55 000 people a total of 300 000 people mainly by shooting or with hand grenades at mass killing sites outside the major towns  The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum tells the story of one survivor of the Einsatzgruppen in Piryatin  Ukraine  when they killed 1 600 Jews on April 6  1942  the second day of Passover  I saw them do the killing  At 5 00 p m  they gave the command   Fill in the pits   Screams and groans were coming from the pits  Suddenly I saw my neighbor Ruderman rise from under the soil     His eyes were bloody and he was screaming   Finish me off       A murdered woman lay at my feet  A boy of five years crawled out from under her body and began to scream desperately   Mommy   That was all I saw  since I fell unconscious  107  The most notorious massacre of Jews in the Soviet Union was at a ravine called Babi Yar outside Kiev  where 33 771 Jews were killed in a single operation on September 29 30  1941  The killing of all the Jews in Kiev was decided on by the military governor  Major General Friedrich Eberhardt   the Police Commander for Army Group South  SS Obergruppenf hrer Friedrich Jeckeln  and the Einsatzgruppe C Commander Otto Rasch  It was carried out by a mixture of SS  SD and Security Police  assisted by Ukrainian police  On Monday the Jews of Kiev gathered by the cemetery  expecting to be loaded onto trains  The crowd was large enough that most of the men  women  and children could not have known what was happening until it was too late  by the time they heard the machine gun fire  there was no chance to escape  All were driven down a corridor of soldiers  in groups of ten  and then shot  A truck driver described the scene  as one after the other  they had to remove their luggage  then their coats  shoes  and outer garments and also underwear     Once undressed  they were led into the ravine which was about 150 meters long and 30 meters wide and a good 15 meters deep     When they reached the bottom of the ravine they were seized by members of the Schutzpolizei and made to lie down on top of Jews who had already been shot     The corpses were literally in layers  A police marksman came along and shot each Jew in the neck with a submachine gun     I saw these marksmen stand on layers of corpses and shoot one after the other     The marksman would walk across the bodies of the executed Jews to the next Jew  who had meanwhile lain down  and shoot him  109  From left to right  Heinrich Himmler  Reinhard Heydrich  and Karl Wolff  second from the right  at the Obersalzberg  May 1939  Wolff wrote in his diary that Himmler had vomited after witnessing the mass shooting of 100 Jews  110  In August 1941 Himmler travelled to Minsk  where he personally witnessed 100 Jews being shot in a ditch outside the town  an event described by Karl Wolff in his diary   Himmler s face was green  He took out his handkerchief and wiped his cheek where a piece of brain had squirted up onto it  Then he vomited   After recovering his composure  he lectured the SS men on the need to follow the  highest moral law of the Party  in carrying out their tasks  New methods of mass murder Starting in December 1939  the Nazis introduced new methods of mass murder by using gas  111  First  experimental gas vans equipped with gas cylinders and a sealed trunk compartment  were used to kill mental care clients of sanatoria in Pomerania  East Prussia  and occupied Poland  as part of an operation termed Action T4  111  In the Sachsenhausen concentration camp  larger vans holding up to 100 people were used from November 1941  using the engine s exhaust rather than a cylinder  111  These vans were introduced to the Che mno concentration camp in December 1941  and another 15 of them were used by the Einsatzgruppen in the occupied Soviet Union  111  These gas vans were developed and run under supervision of the Reich Main Security Office  and were used to kill about 500 000 people  primarily Jews  but also Romani and others  111  The vans were carefully monitored and after a month of observation a report stated that  ninety seven thousand have been processed using three vans  without any defects showing up in the machines   112  A need for new mass murder techniques was also expressed by Hans Frank  governor of the General Government  who noted that this many people could not be simply shot   We shall have to take steps  however  designed in some way to eliminate them   It was this problem which led the SS to experiment with large scale killings using poison gas  Finally  Christian Wirth seems to have been the inventor of the gas chamber  Wannsee Conference and the Final Solution  1942 1945  Further information  Operation Reinhard and Wannsee Conference The dining room

methodically tracked the progress of the Holocaust in thousands of reports and documents  Pictured is the H fle Telegram sent to Adolf Eichmann in January  1943  that reported that 1 274 166 Jews had been killed in the four Aktion Reinhard camps during 1942  The Wannsee Conference was convened by Reinhard Heydrich on January 20  1942 in the Berlin suburb of Wannsee and brought together some 15 Nazi leaders which included a number of state secretaries  senior officials  party leaders  SS officers and other leaders of government departments who were responsible for policies which were linked to Jewish issues  The initial purpose of the meeting was to discuss plans for a comprehensive solution to the  Jewish question in Europe   Heydrich intended to  outline the mass murders in the various occupied territories    as part of a solution to the European Jewish question ordered by Hitler  to ensure that they  and especially the ministerial bureaucracy  would share both knowledge and responsibility for this policy    116  A copy of the minutes which were drawn up by Eichmann has survived  but on Heydrich s instructions  they were written up in  euphemistic language   Thus the exact words used at the meeting are not known   117  However  Heydrich addressed the meeting indicating the the policy of emigration was superseded by a policy of evacuating Jews to the east  This was seen to be only a temporary solution leading up to a final solution which would involve some 11 million Jews living not only in territories controlled then by the Germans  but to major countries in the rest of the world including the UK  and the US   118  There was little doubt what the solution was   Heydrich also made it clear what was understood by the phrase  Final Solution   the Jews were to be annihilated by a combination of forced labour and mass murder    119  The officials were told there were 2 3 million Jews in the General Government  850 000 in Hungary  1 1 million in the other occupied countries  and up to 5 million in the USSR  although 2 million of these were in areas still under Soviet control   a total of about 6 5 million  These would all be transported by train to extermination camps  Vernichtungslager  in Poland  where almost all of them would be gassed at once  In some camps  such as Auschwitz  those fit for work would be kept alive for a while  but eventually all would be killed  G ring s representative  Dr  Erich Neumann  gained a limited exemption for some classes of industrial workers  120  German public reaction In his 1983 book  Popular Opinion and Political Dissent in the Third Reich  Ian Kershaw examined the Alltagsgeschichte  history of everyday life  in Bavaria during the Nazi period  121  Describing the attitudes of most Bavarians  Kershaw argued that the most common viewpoint was indifference towards what was happening to the Jews  122  Kershaw argued that most Bavarians were vaguely aware of the Shoah  but were vastly more concerned about the war than about the  Final Solution to the Jewish Question   122  Kershaw made the claim that  the road to Auschwitz was built by hate  but paved with indifference   123  124  Kershaw s assessment that most Bavarians  and by implication most Germans  were indifferent to the Shoah faced criticism from the Israeli historian Otto Dov Kulka  an expert on public opinion in Nazi Germany  and the Canadian historian Michael Kater  Kater contended that Kershaw downplayed the extent of popular antisemitism  and that though admitting that most of the  spontaneous  antisemitic actions of Nazi Germany were staged  argued that because these actions involved substantial numbers of Germans  it is wrong to see the extreme antisemitism of the Nazis as coming solely from above  125  Kulka argued that most Germans were more anti Semitic than Kershaw portrayed them in Popular Opinion and Political Dissent  and that rather than  indifference    passive complicity  would be a better term to describe the reaction of the German people  126  In a study focusing only on the views about Jews of Germans opposed to the Nazi regime  the German historian Christof Dipper in his 1983 essay  Der Deutsche Widerstand und die Juden   translated into English as  The German Resistance and the Jews  in Yad Vashem Studies  Volume 16  1984  argued that the majority of the anti Nazi national conservatives were antisemitic  127  Dipper wrote that for the majority of the national conservatives  the bureaucratic  pseudo legal deprivation of the Jews practiced until 1938 was still considered acceptable   127  Though Dipper noted no one in the German resistance supported the Holocaust  he also commented that the national conservatives did not intend to restore civil rights to the Jews after the planned overthrow of Hitler  127  Dipper went on to argue that  based on such views held by opponents of the regime   a large part of the German people   believed that a  Jewish Question  existed and had to be solved      127  Motivation In his 1965 essay  Command and Compliance   which originated in his work as an expert witness for the prosecution at the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials  the German historian Hans Buchheim wrote there was no coercion to murder Jews and others  and all who committed such actions did so out of free will  128  Buchheim wrote that chances to avoid executing criminal orders     were both more numerous and more real than those concerned are generally prepared to admit      128  and that he found no evidence that SS men who refused to carry out criminal orders were sent to a concentration camps or executed  129  Moreover  SS rules prohibited acts of gratuitous sadism  as Himmler wished for his men to remain  decent   and that acts of sadism were taken on the individual initiative of those who were either especially cruel or who wished to prove themselves ardent National Socialists  128  Finally  he argued that those of a non criminal bent who committed crimes did so because they wished to conform to the values of the group they had joined and were afraid of being branded  weak  by their by colleagues if they refused  130  In his 1992 book Ordinary Men  Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland  Christopher Browning examined the German Ordnungspolizei Reserve Battalion 101  used to massacre and round up Jews for deportation to the Nazi death camps  The men of the battalion were middle aged men of working class background from Hamburg  who were unfit for military duty and were given no special training for genocide  The commander of the unit gave his men the choice of opting out of direct participation if they found it too unpleasant  for example  by being part of a passive cordon round the area of the killing   The majority chose not to exercise that option  fewer than 15 men out of a battalion of 500 did so  131  Much influenced by the work of Stanley Milgram  Browning argued that the men of the battalion killed out of obedience to authority and peer pressure  not blood lust or hatred  The general implication of the book is that when placed in a cohesive group setting  most people will obey commands given by an authority figure seen as legitimate  even if they find them morally reprehensible  a hypothesis studied in the Milgram Experiment  The Russian historian Sergei Kudryashov studied the guards trained at the Trawniki concentration camp  who provided the bulk of personnel for the Operation Reinhard death camps  Some Trawniki guards were Red Army POWs who volunteered to join the SS in order to get out of the POW camps  132  The majority of the Trawniki men were Ukrainians or Volksdeutche  though there were also Russians  Poles  Latvians  Lithuanians  Tartars  Georgians  Armenians and Azerbaijanis amongst them  133  Kudryashov reported that he found there was little sign of antisemitism or any attraction to National Socialism among the Trawniki men  many of whom prior to their capture had been Communists  134  Despite the generally apathetic views of the Trawniki guards  the vast majority faithfully carried out the SS s expectations of how to mistreat Jews  the mistreatment of Jews by the Trawniki guards was  systematic and without any particular cause   134  Many  through not all of the Trawniki men executed Jews  and almost all of them while working as guards in the Operation Reinhard camps personally killed dozens of Jews  135  Following Christopher Browning  Kudryashov argued that the Trawniki men were examples of ordinary people becoming willing killers out of peer pressure and obedience to authority  136  Extermination camps Main article  Extermination camp Approx  number killed at each extermination camp 137  Camp name

 154  During 1942  in addition to Auschwitz  five other camps were designated as extermination camps  Vernichtungslager  for the carrying out of the Reinhard plan  155  156  Two of these  Che mno  also known as Kulmhof  and Majdanek were already functioning as labor camps  these now had extermination facilities added to them  Three new camps were built for the sole purpose of killing large numbers of Jews as quickly as possible  at Belzec  Sobibor and Treblinka  A seventh camp  at Maly Trostinets in Belarus  was also used for this purpose  Jasenovac was an extermination camp where mostly ethnic Serbs were killed  Extermination camps are frequently confused with concentration camps such as Dachau and Belsen  which were mostly located in Germany and intended as places of incarceration and forced labor for a variety of enemies of the Nazi regime  such as Communists and homosexuals   They should also be distinguished from slave labor camps  which were set up in all German occupied countries to exploit the labor of prisoners of various kinds  including prisoners of war  In all Nazi camps there were very high death rates as a result of starvation  disease and exhaustion  but only the extermination camps were designed specifically for mass killing    There was a place called the ramp where the trains with the Jews were coming in  They were coming in day and night  and sometimes one per day and sometimes five per day     Constantly  people from the heart of Europe were disappearing  and they were arriving to the same place with the same ignorance of the fate of the previous transport  And the people in this mass     I knew that within a couple of hours     ninety percent would be gassed     Rudolf Vrba  who worked on the Judenrampe in Auschwitz from August 18  1942 to June 7  1943  157  The extermination camps were run by SS officers  but most of the guards were Ukrainian or Baltic auxiliaries  Regular German soldiers were kept well away  Gas chambers At the extermination camps with gas chambers all the prisoners arrived by train  Sometimes entire trainloads were sent straight to the gas chambers  but usually the camp doctor on duty subjected individuals to selections  where a small percentage were deemed fit to work in the slave labor camps  the majority were taken directly from the platforms to a reception area where all their clothes and other possessions were seized by the Nazis to help fund the war  They were then herded naked into the gas chambers  Usually they were told these were showers or delousing chambers  and there were signs outside saying  baths  and  sauna   They were sometimes given a small piece of soap and a towel so as to avoid panic  and were told to remember where they had put their belongings for the same reason  When they asked for water because they were thirsty after the long journey in the cattle trains  they were told to hurry up  because coffee was waiting for them in the camp  and it was getting cold  158  Picture of Auschwitz Birkenau taken by an American surveillance plane  September 13  1944  According to Rudolf H    commandant of Auschwitz  bunker 1 held 800 people  and bunker 2 held 1 200  159  Once the chamber was full  the doors were screwed shut and solid pellets of Zyklon B were dropped into the chambers through vents in the side walls  releasing toxic HCN  or hydrogen cyanide  Those inside died within 20 minutes  the speed of death depended on how close the inmate was standing to a gas vent  according to H    who estimated that about one third of the victims died immediately  160  Joann Kremer  an SS doctor who oversaw the gassings  testified that   Shouting and screaming of the victims could be heard through the opening and it was clear that they fought for their lives   161  When they were removed  if the chamber had been very congested  as they often were  the victims were found half squatting  their skin colored pink with red and green spots  some foaming at the mouth or bleeding from the ears  160  The gas was then pumped out  the bodies were removed  which would take up to four hours   gold fillings in their teeth were extracted with pliers by dentist prisoners  and women s hair was cut  162  The floor of the gas chamber was cleaned  and the walls whitewashed  161  The work was done by the Sonderkommando  which were work units of Jewish prisoners  In crematoria 1 and 2  the Sonderkommando lived in an attic above the crematoria  in crematoria 3 and 4  they lived inside the gas chambers  163  When the Sonderkommando had finished with the bodies  the SS conducted spot checks to make sure all the gold had been removed from the victims  mouths  If a check revealed that gold had been missed  the Sonderkommando prisoner responsible was thrown into the furnace alive as punishment  164  At first  the bodies were buried in deep pits and covered with lime  but between September and November 1942  on the orders of Himmler  they were dug up and burned  In the spring of 1943  new gas chambers and crematoria were built to accommodate the numbers  165  Another improvement we made over Treblinka was that we built our gas chambers to accommodate 2 000 people at one time  whereas at Treblinka their 10 gas chambers only accommodated 200 people each  The way we selected our victims was as follows  we had two SS doctors on duty at Auschwitz to examine the incoming transports of prisoners  The prisoners would be marched by one of the doctors who would make spot decisions as they walked by  Those who were fit for work were sent into the Camp  Others were sent immediately to the extermination plants  Children of tender years were invariably exterminated  since by reason of their youth they were unable to work  Still another improvement we made over Treblinka was that at Treblinka the victims almost always knew that they were to be exterminated and at Auschwitz we endeavored to fool the victims into thinking that they were to go through a delousing process  Of course  frequently they realized our true intentions and we sometimes had riots and difficulties due to that fact  Very frequently women would hide their children under the clothes but of course when we found them we would send the children in to be exterminated  We were required to carry out these exterminations in secrecy but of course the foul and nauseating stench from the continuous burning of bodies permeated the entire area and all of the people living in the surrounding communities knew that exterminations were going on at Auschwitz    Rudolf H    Auschwitz camp commandant  Nuremberg testimony  166  Jewish resistance Jews captured and forcibly pulled out from dugouts by the Germans during the Warsaw Ghetto uprising  The photo is from Jurgen Stroop s report to Heinrich Himmler Warsaw Ghetto uprising Main article  Jewish resistance during the Holocaust Yehuda Bauer and other historians argue that resistance consisted not only of physical opposition  but of any activity that gave the Jews dignity and humanity in humiliating and inhumane conditions  167  In every ghetto  in every deportation train  in every labor camp  even in the death camps  the will to resist was strong  and took many forms  Fighting with the few weapons that would be found  individual acts of defiance and protest  the courage of obtaining food and water under the threat of death  the superiority of refusing to allow the Germans their final wish to gloat over panic and despair  Even passivity was a form of resistance  To die with dignity was a form of resistance  To resist the demoralizing  brutalizing force of evil  to refuse to be reduced to the level of animals  to live through the torment  to outlive the tormentors  these too were acts of resistance  Merely to give a witness of these events in testimony was  in the end  a contribution to victory  Simply to survive was a victory of the human spirit     Martin Gilbert  The Holocaust  The Jewish Tragedy  168  There are many examples of Jewish resistance  most notably the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of January 1943  when thousands of poorly armed Jewish fighters held the SS at bay for four weeks before being crushed by overwhelmingly superior forces  According to Jewish accounts  several hundred Germans were killed  while the Germans claimed to have lost 17 dead and 93 wounded  13 000 Jews were killed during the uprising  and 57 885 were deported and gassed according to German figures  This uprising was followed by the uprising in the Treblinka extermination camp in May 1943  when about 200 inmates escaped from the camp after overpowering the guards  They killed a number of German guards and set the camp buildings ablaze  but 900 inmates were also killed  and out of the 600 who successfully escaped  only 40 survived the war  Two weeks later  there was an uprising in the Bia ystok ghetto  In September  there was a short lived uprising in the Vilnius ghetto  In October  600 Jewish prisoners  including Jewish Soviet prisoners of war  attempted an escape at the Sobibor death camp  The prisoners killed 11 German SS officers and a number of camp guards  However  the killings were discovered  and the inmates were forced to run for their lives under heavy fire  300 of the prisoners were killed during the escape  Most of the survivors either died in the minefields surrounding the camp or were recaptured and executed  About 60 survived and joined the Soviet partisans  On October 7  1944  250 Jewish Sonderkommandos  laborers  at Auschwitz attacked their guards and blew up Crematorium IV with explosives female prisoners had smuggled in from a nearby factory  Three German guards were killed during the uprising  one of whom was stuffed into an oven  The Sonderkommandos attempted a mass breakout  but all 250 were killed soon after  An estimated 20 000 to 30 000 Jewish partisans  see the list at the top of this section  actively fought the Nazis and their collaborators in Eastern Europe  169  170  They engaged in guerilla warfare and sabotage against the Nazis  instigated Ghetto uprisings  and freed prisoners  In Lithuania alone  they killed approximately 3 000 German soldiers  As many as 1 4 million Jewish soldiers fought in the Allied armies  171  Of these  approximately 40  served in the Red Army  171  About 200 000 Jewish soldiers serving in the Red Army died in the war  172  The Jewish Brigade  a unit of 5 000 Jewish volunteers from the British Mandate of Palestine  fought in the British Army  German speaking Jewish volunteers from the Special Interrogation Group performed commando and sabotage operations against the Nazis behind front lines in the Western Desert Campaign  In occupied Poland and Soviet territories  thousands of Jews fled into the swamps or forests and joined the partisans  although the partisan movements did not always welcome them  In Lithuania and Belarus  an area with a heavy concentration of Jews  and also an area which suited partisan operations  Jewish partisan groups saved thousands of Jewish civilians from extermination  No such opportunities existed for the Jewish populations of cities such as Budapest  However in Amsterdam  and other parts of the Netherlands  many Jews were active in the Dutch Resistance  173 Timothy Snyder wrote that  Other combatants in the Warsaw Uprising were veterans of the ghetto uprising of 1943  Most of these Jews joined the Home Army  others found the People s Army  or even the anti Semitic National Armed Forces  Some Jews  or Poles of Jewish origin  were already enlisted in the Home Army and the People s Army  Almost certainly  more Jews fought in the Warsaw Uprising of August 1944 than in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of April 1943   174  Joining the partisans was an option only for the young and the fit who were willing to leave their families  Many Jewish families preferred to die together rather than be separated  French Jews were also highly active in the French Resistance  which conducted a massive guerilla campaign against the Nazis and Vichy French authorities  assisted the Allies in their sweep across France  and supported Allied including Free French forces in the liberation of many occupied French cities  Although Jews made up only one percent of the French population  they made up fifteen to twenty percent of the French Resistance  175  The Jewish youth movement EEIF  which had originally shown support for the Vichy regime  was banned in 1943  and many of its older members formed armed resistance units  Zionist Jews also formed the Armee Juive  Jewish Army   which participated in armed resistance under a Zionist flag  and smuggled Jews out of the country  Both organizations merged in 1944  and participated in the liberation of Paris  Lyon  Toulouse  Grenoble  and Nice  176   Many people think the Jews went to their deaths like sheep to the slaughter  and that s not true it s absolutely not true  I worked closely with many Jewish people in the Resistance  and I can tell you  they took much greater risks than I did     Pieter Meerburg  The Heart Has Reasons  Holocaust Rescuers and Their Stories of Courage  177  For the great majority of Jews resistance could take only the passive forms of delay  evasion  negotiation  bargaining and  where possible  bribery of German officials  The Nazis encouraged this by forcing the Jewish communities to police themselves  through bodies such as the Reich Association of Jews  Reichsvereinigung der Juden  in Germany and the Jewish Councils  Judenr te  in the urban ghettos in occupied Poland  They held out the promise of concessions in exchange for each surrender  enmeshing the Jewish leadership so deeply in well intentioned compromise that a decision to stand and fight was never possible  Holocaust survivor Alexander Kimel wrote   The youth in the Ghettos dreamed about fighting  I believe that although there were many factors that inhibited our responses  the most important factors were isolation and historical conditioning to accepting martyrdom   178  The historical conditioning of the Jewish communities of Europe to accept persecution and avert disaster through compromise and negotiation was the most important factor in the failure to resist until the very end  The Warsaw Ghetto uprising took place only when the Jewish population had been reduced from 500 000 to 100 000  and it was obvious that no further compromise was possible  Paul Johnson writes   The Jews had been persecuted for a millennium and a half and had learned from long experience that resistance cost lives rather than saved them  Their history  their theology  their folklore  their social structure  even their vocabulary trained them to negotiate  to pay  to plead  to protest  not to fight   179  The Jewish communities were also systematically deceived about German intentions  and were cut off from most sources of news from the outside world  The Germans told the Jews that they were being deported to work camps   euphemistically calling it  resettlement in the East    and maintained this illusion through elaborate deceptions all the way to the gas chamber doors  which were marked with labels stating that the chambers were for removal of lice  to avoid uprisings  As photographs testify  Jews disembarked at the railway stations at Auschwitz and other extermination camps carrying sacks and suitcases  clearly having no idea of the fate that awaited them  Rumours of the reality of the extermination camps filtered back only slowly to the ghettos  and were usually not believed  just as they were not believed when couriers such as Jan Karski  the Polish resistance fighter  conveyed them to the western Allies  180  Climax This

was assassinated in Prague in June 1942  He was succeeded as head of the RSHA by Ernst Kaltenbrunner  Kaltenbrunner and Eichmann  under Himmler s close supervision  oversaw the climax of the Final Solution  During 1943 and 1944  the extermination camps worked at a furious rate to kill the hundreds of thousands of people shipped to them by rail from almost every country within the German sphere of influence  By the spring of 1944  up to 8 000 people were being gassed every day at Auschwitz  181  Despite the high productivity of the war industries based in the Jewish ghettos in the General Government  during 1943 they were liquidated  and their populations shipped to the camps for extermination  The largest of these operations  the deportation of 100 000 people from the Warsaw Ghetto in early 1943  provoked the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising  which was suppressed with great brutality  Approximately 42 000 Jews were shot during the Operation Harvest Festival on November 3 4  1943  182  At the same time  rail shipments arrived regularly from western and southern Europe  Few Jews were shipped from the occupied Soviet territories to the camps  the killing of Jews in this zone was left in the hands of the SS  aided by locally recruited auxiliaries  In any case  by the end of 1943 the Germans had been driven from most Soviet territory  Shipments of Jews to the camps had priority on the German railways  and continued even in the face of the increasingly dire military situation after the Battle of Stalingrad at the end of 1942 and the escalating Allied air attacks on German industry and transport  Army leaders and economic managers complained at this diversion of resources and at the killing of irreplaceable skilled Jewish workers  By 1944  moreover  it was evident to most Germans not blinded by Nazi fanaticism that Germany was losing the war  Many senior officials began to fear the retribution that might await Germany and them personally for the crimes being committed in their name  But the power of Himmler and the SS within the German Reich was too great to resist  and Himmler could always evoke Hitler s authority for his demands  Budapest  Hungary   Captured Jewish women in Wessel nyi Street  October 20 22  1944 Budapest  Hungary   Hungarian and German soldiers drive arrested Jews into the municipal theatre  October 1944  In October 1943  Himmler gave a speech to senior Nazi Party officials gathered in Posen  now Pozna  in western Poland   Here he came closer than ever before to stating explicitly that he was intent on exterminating the Jews of Europe  I may here in this closest of circles allude to a question which you  my party comrades  have all taken for granted  but which has become for me the most difficult question of my life  the Jewish question     I ask of you that what I say in this circle you really only hear and never speak of     We come to the question  how is it with the women and children  I have resolved even here on a completely clear solution  I do not consider myself justified in eradicating the men so to speak killing them or ordering them to be killed and allowing the avengers in the shape of the children to grow up     The difficult decision had to be taken  to cause this people to disappear from the earth  The audience for this speech included Admiral Karl D nitz and Armaments Minister Albert Speer  both of whom successfully claimed at the Nuremberg trials that they had had no knowledge of the Final Solution  The text of this speech was not known at the time of their trials  The scale of extermination slackened somewhat at the beginning of 1944 once the ghettos in occupied Poland were emptied  but on March 19  1944  Hitler ordered the military occupation of Hungary  and Eichmann was dispatched to Budapest to supervise the deportation of Hungary s 800 000 Jews  Hitler had personally complained to the Hungarian regent Admiral Mikl s Horthy on the previous day  March 18  1944  that  Hungary did nothing in the matter of the Jewish problem  and was not prepared to settle accounts with the large Jewish population in Hungary  183  More than half of them were shipped to Auschwitz in the course of the year  The commandant  Rudolf H    said at his trial that he killed 400 000 Hungarian Jews in three months   Blood for Goods  The operation to kill Hungarian Jews met strong opposition within the Nazi hierarchy  and there were some suggestions that Hitler should offer the Allies a deal where they would be spared in exchange for a favorable peace settlement  There were unofficial negotiations in Istanbul between Himmler s agents  British agents  and representatives of Jewish organizations  at one point an attempt by Eichmann to exchange one million Jews for 10 000 trucks the so called  blood for goods  proposal but there was no real possibility of such a deal being struck  Escapes  publication of existence  April June 1944  Bratislava  June July 1944  Rudolf Vrba  right  escaped from Auschwitz on April 7  1944  bringing the first credible news to the world of the mass murder that was taking place there  Arnost Rosin  left   escaped on May 27  1944  184   The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland   note of Republic of Poland addressed to United Nations  1942 Escapes from the camps were few  but not unknown  The few Auschwitz escapes that succeeded were made possible by the Polish underground inside the camp and local people outside  185  In 1940  the Auschwitz commandant reported that  the local population is fanatically Polish and     prepared to take any action against the hated SS camp personnel  Every prisoner who managed to escape can count on help the moment he reaches the wall of a first Polish farmstead   186  In February 1942  an escaped inmate from the Che mno extermination camp  Jacob Grojanowski  reached the Warsaw Ghetto  where he gave detailed information about the Che mno camp to the Oneg Shabbat group  His report  which became known as the Grojanowski Report  was smuggled out of the ghetto through the channels of the Polish underground to the Delegatura  and reached London by June 1942  It is unclear what was done with the report at that point  143  187  188  189  In the meantime  by February 1  the United States Office of War Information had decided not to release information about the extermination of the Jews because it was felt that it would mislead the public into thinking the war was simply a Jewish problem  190  By at least October 9  1942  British radio had broadcast news of gassing of Jews to the Netherlands  191  In December 1942  the western Allies released the Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations  that described how  Hitler s oft repeated intention to exterminate the Jewish people in Europe  was being carried out and which declared that they  condemn in the strongest possible terms this bestial policy of cold blooded extermination   192  193  In 1942  Jan Karski reported to the Polish  British and U S  governments on the situation in Poland  especially the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto and the Holocaust of the Jews  He met with Polish politicians in exile including the prime minister  as well as members of political parties such as the PPS  SN  SP  SL  Jewish Bund and Poalei Zion  He also spoke to Anthony Eden  the British foreign secretary  and included a detailed statement on what he had seen in Warsaw and Be  ec  194  In 1943 in London he met the then well known journalist Arthur Koestler  He then traveled to the United States and reported to President Franklin D  Roosevelt  His report was a major factor in informing the West  In July 1943  Karski again personally reported to Roosevelt about the situation in Poland  During their meeting Roosevelt suddenly interrupted his report and asked about the condition of horses in occupied Poland  195  196  197  He also met with many other government and civic leaders in the United States  including Felix Frankfurter  Cordell Hull  William Joseph Donovan  and Stephen Wise  Karski also presented his report to media  bishops of various denominations  including Cardinal Samuel Stritch   members of the Hollywood film industry and artists  but without success  Many of those he spoke to did not believe him  or supposed that his testimony was much exaggerated or was propaganda from the Polish government in exile  198  News about gassing Jews was also published in illegal newspapers of the Dutch resistance  like in the issue of Het Parool of September 27  1943  However  the news was so unbelievable that many assumed it was merely war propaganda  The publications were halted because they were counter productive for the Dutch resistance  Nevertheless  many Jews were warned that they would be murdered  but as escape was impossible for most of them  they preferred to believe that the warnings were false  199  200  Auschwitz concentration camp photos of Pilecki  1941  In September 1940  Captain Witold Pilecki  a member of the Polish underground and a soldier of the Home Army  worked out a plan to enter Auschwitz and volunteered to be sent there  the only known person to volunteer to be imprisoned at Auschwitz  He organized an underground network Zwi zek Organizacji Wojskowej  translation   Union of Military Organizations   that was ready to initiate an uprising but it was decided that the probability of success was too low for the uprising to succeed  UMO s numerous and detailed reports became later a principal source of intelligence on Auschwitz for the Western Allies  Pilecki escaped from Auschwitz with information that became the basis of a two part report in August 1943 that was sent to the Office of Strategic Services  OSS  in London  The report included details about the gas chambers  about  selection   and about the sterilization experiments  It stated that there were three crematoria in Birkenau able to burn 10 000 people daily  and that 30 000 people had been gassed in one day  The author wrote   History knows no parallel of such destruction of human life   Raul Hilberg writes that the report was filed away with a note that there was no indication as to the reliability of the source  201  When Pilecki returned to Poland after the war the communist authorities arrested and accused him of spying for the Polish government in exile  He was sentenced to death in a show trial and was executed on May 25  1948  Before Pilecki escaped from Auschwitz the most spectacular escape took place on June 20  1942  when Ukrainian Eugeniusz Bendera and three Poles  Kazimierz Piechowski  Stanis aw Gustaw Jaster and J zef Lempart made a daring escape  202  The escapees were dressed as members of the SS Totenkopfverb nde  fully armed and in an SS staff car  They drove out the main gate in a stolen Rudolf Hoss automobile Steyr 220 with a smuggled first report from Witold Pilecki to Polish resistance about the Holocaust  The Germans never recaptured any of them  203  Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler  Jewish inmates  escaped from Auschwitz in April 1944  eventually reaching Slovakia  The 32 page document they dictated to Jewish officials about the mass murder at Auschwitz became known as the Vrba Wetzler report  Vrba had an eidetic memory and had worked on the Judenrampe  where Jews disembarked from the trains to be  selected  either for the gas chamber or slave labor  The level of detail with which he described the transports allowed Slovakian officials to compare his account with their own deportation records  and the corroboration convinced the Allies to take the report seriously  184  204  Two other Auschwitz inmates  Arnost Rosin and Czes aw Mordowicz escaped on May 27  1944  arriving in Slovakia on June 6  the day of the Normandy landing  D Day   Hearing about Normandy  they believed the war was over and got drunk to celebrate  using dollars they d smuggled out of the camp  They were arrested for violating currency laws  and spent eight days in prison  before the Judenrat paid their fines  The additional information they offered the Judenrat was added to Vrba and Wetzler s report and became known as the Auschwitz Protocols  They reported that  between May 15 and May 27  1944  100 000 Hungarian Jews had arrived at Birkenau  and had been killed at an unprecedented rate  with human fat being used to accelerate the burning  205  The BBC and The New York Times published material from the Vrba Wetzler report on June 15 206  June 20  July 3 207  and July 6 208  1944  The subsequent pressure from world leaders persuaded Mikl s Horthy to bring the mass deportations of Jews from Hungary to Auschwitz to a halt on July 9  saving up to 200 000 Jews from the extermination camps  205  On November 14  2001  in the 150th anniversary issue  The New York Times ran an article by former editor Max Frankel reporting that before and during World War II  the Times had maintained a strict policy in their news reporting and editorials to minimize reports on the Holocaust  209  The Times accepted the detailed analysis and findings of journalism professor Laurel Leff  who had published an article the year before in the Harvard International Journal of the Press and Politics  that The New York Times had deliberately suppressed news of the Third Reich s persecution and murder of Jews  210  Leff concluded that New York Times reporting and editorial policies made it virtually impossible for American Jews to impress Congress  church or government leaders with the importance of helping Europe s Jews  211  Further information  The New York Times and the Holocaust Death marches  1944 1945  Main article  Death marches  Holocaust  Although most children were immediately killed upon arrival at Auschwitz  this group includes Jewish twins kept alive to be used in Mengele s medical experiments  These children from Auschwitz were liberated by the Red Army in January  1945  By mid 1944  the Final Solution had largely run its course  Those Jewish communities within easy reach of the Nazi regime had been largely exterminated  in proportions ranging from about 25 percent in France to more than 90 percent in Poland  In May  Himmler claimed in a speech that  The Jewish question in Germany and the occupied countries has been solved   212  During 1944  in any case  the task became steadily more difficult  German armies were evicted from the Soviet Union  the Balkans and Italy  and German allies were either defeated or were switching sides to the Allies  In June  the western Allies landed in France  Allied air attacks and the operations of partisans made rail transport increasingly difficult  and the objections of the military to the diversion of rail transport for carrying Jews to Poland more urgent and harder to ignore  At this time  as the Soviet armed forces approached  the camps in eastern Poland were closed down  any surviving inmates being shipped west to camps closer to Germany  first to Auschwitz and later to Gross Rosen in Silesia  Auschwitz itself was closed as the Soviets advanced through Poland  The last 13 prisoners  all women  were killed in Auschwitz II on November 25  1944  records show they were  unmittelbar get tet    killed outright    leaving open whether they were gassed or otherwise disposed of  213  Despite the desperate military situation  great efforts were made to conceal evidence of what had happened in the camps  The gas chambers were dismantled  the crematoria dynamited  mass graves dug up and the corpses cremated  and Polish farmers were induced to plant crops on the sites to give the impression that they had never existed  Local commanders continued to kill Jews  and to shuttle them from camp to camp by forced  death marches  until the last weeks of the war  214  Already sick after months or years of violence and starvation  prisoners were forced to march for tens of miles in the snow to train stations  then transported for days at a time without food or shelter in freight trains with open carriages  and forced to march again at the other end to the new camp  Those who lagged behind or fell were shot  Around 250 000 Jews died during these marches  215  The largest and best known of the death marches took place in January 1945  when the Soviet army advanced on Poland  Nine days before the Soviets arrived at Auschwitz  the SS marched 60 000 prisoners out of the camp toward Wodzislaw  56 km  35 mi  away  where they were put on freight trains to other camps  Around 15 000 died on the way  Elie Wiesel and his father  Shlomo  were among the marchers  An icy wind blew in violent gusts  But we marched without faltering  Pitch darkness  Every now and then  an explosion in the night  They had orders to fire on any who could not keep up  Their fingers on the triggers  they did not deprive themselves of this pleasure  If one of us had stopped for a second  a sharp shot finished off another filthy son of a bitch  Near me  men were collapsing in the dirty snow  Shots  216  Liberation A grave inside Bergen Belsen Starving prisoners in Mauthausen camp

destroyed by the Nazis in 1943  Colonel William W  Quinn of the U S  7th Army said of Dachau   There our troops found sights  sounds  and stenches horrible beyond belief  cruelties so enormous as to be incomprehensible to the normal mind   218  219  In most of the camps discovered by the Soviets  almost all the prisoners had already been removed  leaving only a few thousand alive 7 000 inmates were found in Auschwitz  including 180 children who had been experimented on by doctors  220  Some 60 000 prisoners were discovered at Bergen Belsen by the British 11th Armoured Division  221  13 000 corpses lay unburied  and another 10 000 died from typhus or malnutrition over the following weeks  222  The British forced the remaining SS guards to gather up the corpses and place them in mass graves  223  The BBC s Richard Dimbleby described the scenes that greeted him and the British Army at Belsen  224  Here over an acre of ground lay dead and dying people  You could not see which was which     The living lay with their heads against the corpses and around them moved the awful  ghostly procession of emaciated  aimless people  with nothing to do and with no hope of life  unable to move out of your way  unable to look at the terrible sights around them     Babies had been born here  tiny wizened things that could not live     A mother  driven mad  screamed at a British sentry to give her milk for her child  and thrust the tiny mite into his arms     He opened the bundle and found the baby had been dead for days  This day at Belsen was the most horrible of my life  Victims and

the Holocaust  is used  Donald Niewyk and Francis Nicosia write in The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust that the term is commonly defined 8  as the mass murder  and attempt to wipe out  European Jewry  which would bring the total number of victims to just under six million around 78 percent of the 7 3 million Jews in occupied Europe at the time  237  Broader definitions include approximately 2 to 3 million Soviet POWs  2 million ethnic Poles  up to 1 500 000 Romani  200 000 handicapped  political and religious dissenters  15 000 homosexuals and 5 000 Jehovah s Witnesses  bringing the death toll to around 11 million  The broadest definition would include 6 million Soviet civilians  raising the death toll to 17 million  8 R J  Rummel estimates the total democide death toll of Nazi Germany to be 21 million  Other estimates put total casualties of Soviet Union s citizens alone to about 26 million  238  Jewish Since 1945  the most commonly cited figure for the total number of Jews killed has been six million  The Yad Vashem Holocaust Martyrs  and Heroes  Remembrance Authority in Jerusalem  writes that there is no precise figure for the number of Jews killed  The figure most commonly used is the six million attributed to Adolf Eichmann  a senior SS official  239  Early calculations range from 5 1 million from Raul Hilberg  to 5 95 million from Jacob Leschinsky  Yisrael Gutman and Robert Rozett in the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust estimate 5 59 5 86 million  240  A study led by Wolfgang Benz of the Technical University of Berlin suggests 5 29 6 2 million  241  242  Yad Vashem writes that the main sources for these statistics are comparisons of prewar and postwar censuses and population estimates  and Nazi documentation on deportations and murders  241  Its Central Database of Shoah Victims  Names currently holds close to 3 million names of Holocaust victims  all accessible online  Yad Vashem continues its project of collecting names of Jewish victims from historical documents and individual memories  243  Entrance to Auschwitz Birkenau  1945 Hilberg s estimate of 5 1 million  in the third edition of The Destruction of the European Jews  includes over 800 000 who died from  ghettoization and general privation   1 400 000 killed in open air shootings  and up to 2 900 000 who perished in camps  Hilberg estimates the death toll of Jews in Poland as up to 3 000 000  244  Hilberg s numbers are generally considered to be a conservative estimate  as they typically include only those deaths for which records are available  avoiding statistical adjustment  245  British historian Martin Gilbert arrived at a  minimum estimate  of over 5 75 million Jewish victims  246 Lucy S  Dawidowicz used pre war census figures to estimate that 5 934 million Jews died  see table below   247  There were about 8 to 10 million Jews in the territories controlled directly or indirectly by the Nazis  the uncertainty arises from the lack of knowledge about how many Jews there were in the Soviet Union   The six million killed in the Holocaust thus represent 60 to 75 percent of these Jews  Of Poland s 3 3 million Jews  over 90 percent were killed  The same proportion were killed in Latvia and Lithuania  but most of Estonia s Jews were evacuated in time  Of the 750 000 Jews in Germany and Austria in 1933  only about a quarter survived  Although many German Jews emigrated before 1939  the majority of these fled to Czechoslovakia  France or the Netherlands  from where they were later deported to their deaths  In Czechoslovakia  Greece  the Netherlands  and Yugoslavia  over 70 percent were killed  50 to 70 percent were killed in Romania  Belgium and Hungary  It is likely that a similar proportion were killed in Belarus and Ukraine  but these figures are less certain  Countries with notably lower proportions of deaths include Bulgaria  Denmark  France  Italy  and Norway  Albania was the only country occupied by the Nazis that had a significantly larger Jewish population in 1945 than in 1939  About two hundred native Jews and over a thousand refugees were provided with false documents  hidden when necessary  and generally treated as honored guests in a country whose population was roughly 60  Muslim  248  Additionally  Japan  as an Axis member  had its own unique response to Nazi policies regarding Jews  see Shanghai Ghetto  Year Jews

These seven camps thus accounted for half the total number of Jews killed in the entire Nazi Holocaust  Virtually the entire Jewish population of Poland died in these camps  226  In addition to those who died in the above extermination camps  at least half a million Jews died in other camps  including the major concentration camps in Germany  These were not extermination camps  but had large numbers of Jewish prisoners at various times  particularly in the last year of the war as the Nazis withdrew from Poland  About a million people died in these camps  and although the proportion of Jews is not known with certainty  it was estimated to be at least 50 percent  citation needed  Another 800 000 to one million Jews were killed by the Einsatzgruppen in the occupied Soviet territories  an approximate figure  since the Einsatzgruppen killings were frequently undocumented   251  Many more died through execution or of disease and malnutrition in the ghettos of Poland before they could be deported  By country The following figures from Lucy Dawidowicz show the annihilation of the Jewish population of Europe by  pre war  country  226  Country Estimated Pre War Jewish population

Eastern Europe resulted in the adjustment of the death tolls published in the pioneering work by Hilberg  Dawidowicz and Gilbert  e g  compare Gilbert s estimation of 2 million deaths in Auschwitz Birkenau with the updated figure of 1 million in the Extermination Camp data box   As pointed out above  Wolfgang Benz has been carrying out work on the more recent data  He concluded in 1999   The goal of annihilating all of the Jews of Europe  as it was proclaimed at the conference in the villa Am Grossen Wannsee in January 1942  was not reached  Yet the six million murder victims make the holocaust a unique crime in the history of mankind  The number of victims and with certainty the following represent the minimum number in each case cannot express that adequately  Numbers are just too abstract  However they must be stated in order to make clear the dimension of the genocide  165 000 Jews from Germany  65 000 from Austria  32 000 from France and Belgium  more than 100 000 from the Netherlands  60 000 from Greece  the same number from Yugoslavia  more than 140 000 from Czechoslovakia  half a million from Hungary  2 2 million from the Soviet Union  and 2 7 million from Poland  To these numbers must be added all those killed in the pogroms and massacres in Romania and Transitrien  over 200 000  and the deported and murdered Jews from Albania and Norway  Denmark and Italy  from Luxembourg and Bulgaria   252  Effect on Yiddish speaking population of Europe As the significant majority of the Jewish victims of the Holocaust were speakers of Yiddish  the Holocaust had a profound and permanent effect on the fate of Yiddish language and culture  see Yiddish Renaissance   On the eve of World War II  there were 11 to 13 million Yiddish speakers in the world  253  The Holocaust  however  led to a dramatic  sudden decline in the use of Yiddish  as the extensive Jewish communities  both secular and religious  that used Yiddish in their day to day life were largely destroyed  Around 5 million  or 85   of the victims of the Holocaust  were speakers of Yiddish  254  Of the remaining non Yiddish population  the Ladino speaking populations of Greece and the Balkans were also destroyed  which contributed to the extinction of this Judaeo Spanish language  Non Jewish Slavs Main articles  Generalplan Ost and Hunger Plan One of Hitler s ambitions at the start of the war was to exterminate  expel  or enslave most or all Slavs from their native lands so as to make living space for German settlers  This plan of genocide 255  was to be carried into effect gradually over a period of 25 30 years  256  It is a question of existence  thus it will be a racial struggle of pitiless severity  in the course of which 20 to 30 million Slavs and Jews will perish through military actions and crises of food supply    Heinrich Himmler spoke about Operation Barbarossa  June 1941 257  Ethnic Poles Execution of Poles by Einsatzkommando  Leszno  October 1939 Announcement of

Of the Poles  by 1952 only about 3 4 million of them were to be left in the former Poland  and only to serve as slaves for German settlers  They were to be forbidden to marry  the existing ban on any medical help to Poles in Germany would be extended  and eventually Poles would cease to exist  On August 22  1939  about one week before the onset of the war  Hitler had  prepared  for the moment only in the East  my  Death s Head  formations with orders to kill without pity or mercy all men  women and children of Polish descent or language  Only in this way can we obtain the living space we need   260  Nazi planners decided against a genocide of ethnic Poles on the same scale as against ethnic Jews  it could not proceed in the short run since  such a solution to the Polish question would represent a burden to the German people into the distant future  and everywhere rob us of all understanding  not least in that neighbouring peoples would have to reckon at some appropriate time  with a similar fate   258  The actions taken against ethnic Poles were not on the scale of the genocide of the Jews  Most Polish Jews  perhaps 90  of their antebellum population  perished during the Holocaust  while most Christian Poles survived the brutal German occupation  261  Between 1 8 and 2 1 million non Jewish Polish citizens perished in German hands during the course of the war  about four fifths of whom were ethnic Poles with the remaining fifth being ethnic minorities of Ukrainians and Belarusians  the vast majority of them civilians  228  229  At least 200 000 of these victims died in concentration camps with about 146 000 being killed in Auschwitz  Many others died as a result of general massacres such as in the Warsaw Uprising where between 120 000 and 200 000 civilians were killed  262  The policy of the Germans in Poland included diminishing food rations  conscious lowering of the state of hygiene and depriving the population of medical services  The general mortality rate rose from 13 to 18 per thousand  263  Overall  about 5 6 million of the victims World War II were Polish citizens  229  both Jewish and non Jewish  and over the course of the war Poland lost 16 percent of its pre war population  approximately 3 1 million of the 3 3 million Polish Jews and approximately 2 million of the 31 7 million non Jewish Polish citizens died at German hands during the war  264  According to recent  2009  estimates by IPN  over 2 5 million non Jewish Polish citizens died as a result of the German occupation  265  Over 90 percent of the death toll came through non military losses  as most of the civilians were targeted by various deliberate actions by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union  262  A few days before the invasion of Poland  on August 22  1939  Adolf Hitler said to his generals  Genghis Khan led millions of women and children to slaughter with premeditation and a happy heart  History sees in him solely the founder of a state      Our war aim does not consist in reaching certain lines  but in the physical destruction of the enemy  Accordingly  I have placed my death head formations in readiness for the present only in the East with orders to them to send to death mercilessly and without compassion  men  women  and children of Polish derivation and language  Only thus shall we gain the living space  Lebensraum  which we need  Who  after all  speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians      Poland will be depopulated and settled with Germans      As for the rest  gentlemen  the fate of Russia will be exactly the same as I am now going through with in the case of Poland  266  267  Ethnic Slovenes After the invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941  Slovenia was occupied by German Nazis  Italian Fascists and their Hungarian collaborators  On February 25  1942  two days after Italian Fascist regime established Gonars concentration camp  and the first transport of 5 343 internees  1 643 of whom were children  arrived from the Province of Ljubljana and from the Rab concentration camp and the camp in Monigo near Treviso  Mario Roatta was the commander of the 2nd Italian Army in occupied Yugoslavia and to suppress the mounting resistance led by the Partisans adopted tactics of  summary executions  hostage taking  reprisals  internments and the burning of houses and villages   268  Ethnic Slovenes from the western part of nowadays Slovenia  who were subjected to Fascist Italianization since the Treaty of Rapallo  experienced increase in Fascist brutality personified by the fate of Lojze Bratu   a Slovene choirmaster who led several Slovene language church choirs  being tortured and forced to drink petrol and engine oil because he resisted the italianization of Slovenian names and surnames by Fascist Italy  269  which begun as early as 1926 270  271  There was no exception for first names  Excluding Slovenes under Italian rule  between 20 000 and 25 000 thousand Slovenes were killed by Nazis or fascists  counting only civilian victims   272  The overall number of Slovene civilians killed by the Nazis  Italian Fascists and their allies is estimated at around 33 000  this number does not include killed prisoners of war   272  The majority of these victims were from Slovenian regions occupied by the German Nazis  and annexed to the Reich soon after  i e  Lower Styria  Upper Carniola  Zasavje and Slovenian Carinthia  Ethnic Serbs and other South Slavs Main article  World War II persecution of Serbs Usta e soldiers sawing off the head of Branko Jungi   an ethnic Serb from Bosnia  In the Balkans  up to 581 000 Yugoslavs were killed by the Nazis and their Croatian fascist allies in Yugoslavia  273  274  German forces  under express orders from Hitler  fought with a special vengeance against the Serbs  who were considered Untermensch  275  The Usta e collaborators conducted a systematic extermination of large numbers of people for political  religious or racial reasons  The most numerous victims were Serbs  Bosniaks  Croats and others were also victims of the Jasenovac concentration camp  According to the U S  Holocaust Museum   The Usta a authorities established numerous concentration camps in Croatia between 1941 and 1945  These camps were used to isolate and murder Serbs  Jews  Roma  Muslims  Bosniaks   and other non Catholic minorities  as well as Croatian political and religious opponents of the regime   The USHMM and Jewish Virtual Library report between 56 000 and 97 000 persons were killed at the Jasenovac concentration camp  276  277  278  Yad Vashem reports an overall number of over 500 000 murders of Serbs  in horribly sadistic ways  at the hands of the Usta a  279  As per the most recent study  Bosnjaci u Jasenovackom logoru   Bosniaks in Jasenovac concentration camp   by the author Nihad Halilbegovic  at least 103 000 Bosniaks  Bosnian Muslim Slavs  perished during Holocaust at the hands of the Nazi regime and Croatian Usta e  According to the study  unknown is the full number of Bosniaks who were murdered under Serb or Croat alias or national name  and  large numbers of Bosniaks were killed and listed under Roma populations   therefore in advance sentenced to death and extermination  280  281  The Nazi and Albanian cooperation entity was followed by extensive persecution of non Albanians  mostly Serbs  by Albanian fascists  Most of the war crimes were perpetrated by the Skenderbeg SS Division and the Balli Komb tar  Albanian Fascists killed 40 000 to 60 000 Serbs and another 200 000 were driven out  282  283  East Slavs Main articles  Occupation of Belarus by Nazi Germany and Reichskommissariat Ukraine Soviet civilian populations in the occupied areas were also heavily persecuted  in addition to the barbarity of the Eastern Front frontline warfare manifesting itself in episodes such as the siege of Leningrad in which more than 1 million civilians died   284  Thousands of peasant villages across Russia  Belarus and Ukraine were annihilated by German troops  Bohdan Wytwycky has estimated that as many as one quarter of all Soviet civilian deaths at the hands of the Nazis and their allies were racially motivated  8  The Russian Academy of Sciences in 1995 reported civilian victims in the USSR at German hands  including Jews  totaled 13 7 million dead  20  of the 68 million persons in the occupied USSR  This included 7 4 million victims of Nazi genocide and reprisals  285  In Belarus  Nazi Germany imposed a regime in the country that was responsible for burning down some 9 000 villages  deporting some 380 000 people for slave labour  and killing hundreds of thousands of civilians  More than 600 villages  like Khatyn  were burned along with their entire population and at least 5 295 Belarusian settlements were destroyed by the Nazis and some or all of their inhabitants killed  Altogether  1 670 000 civilians  18 percent of the population  were killed during the three years of German occupation  286  including 245 000 Jews killed by the Einsatzgruppen  247  The German racists assigned the Slavs to the lowest rank of human life  from which the Jews were altogether excluded  The Germans thus looked upon Slavs as people not fit to be educated  not able to govern themselves  worthy only as slaves whose existence would be justified because they served their German masters  Hitler s racial policy with regard to the Slavs  to the extent that it was formulated  was  depopulation   The Slavs were to be prevented from procreating  except to provide the necessary continuing supply of slave laborers    Lucy Dawidowicz  The Holocaust and the historians 287  Naked Soviet POWs in Mauthausen concentration camp  Unknown date Soviet POWs Main article  Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs According to Michael Berenbaum  between two and three million Soviet prisoners of war or around 57 percent of all Soviet POWs died of starvation  mistreatment  or executions between June 1941 and May 1945  and most those during their first year of captivity  According to other estimates by Daniel Goldhagen  an estimated 2 8 million Soviet POWs died in eight months in 1941 42  with a total of 3 5 million by mid 1944  288  The USHMM has estimated that 3 3 million of the 5 7 million Soviet POWs died in German custody compared to 8 300 of 231 000 British and American prisoners  289  The death rates decreased as the POWs were needed to work as slaves to help the German war effort  by 1943  half a million of them had been deployed as slave labor  227  Romani people Main article  Porajmos       they wish to toss into the Ghetto everything that is characteristically dirty  shabby  bizarre  of which one ought to be frightened and which anyway had to be destroyed     Emmanuel Ringelblum on the Roma  290  Because the Roma and Sinti are traditionally a secretive people with a culture based on oral history  less is known about their experience of the genocide than about that of any other group  291  292 Yehuda Bauer writes that the lack of information can be attributed to the Roma s distrust and suspicion  and to their humiliation  because some of the basic taboos of Romani culture regarding hygiene and sexual contact were violated at Auschwitz  Bauer writes that  most  Roma  could not relate their stories involving these tortures  as a result  most kept silent and thus increased the effects of the massive trauma they had undergone   293  Map of persecution of the Roma The treatment of Romanis was not consistent in the different areas that Nazi Germany conquered  In some areas  e g  Luxembourg and the Baltic countries   the Nazis killed virtually the entire Romani population  In other areas  e g  Denmark  Greece   there is no record of Romanis being subjected to mass killings  294  Donald Niewyk and Frances Nicosia write that the death toll was at least 130 000 of the nearly one million Roma and Sinti in Nazi controlled Europe  291  Michael Berenbaum writes that serious scholarly estimates lie between 90 000 and 220 000  295  A study by Sybil Milton  senior historian at the U S  Holocaust Memorial Museum  calculated a death toll of at least 220 000 and possibly closer to 500 000  but this study explicitly excluded the Independent State of Croatia where the genocide of Romanies was intense  296  297  Martin Gilbert estimates a total of more than 220 000 of the 700 000 Romani in Europe  298 Ian Hancock  Director of the Program of Romani Studies and the Romani Archives and Documentation Center at the University of Texas at Austin  has argued in favour of a higher figure of between 500 000 and 1 500 000  299  Hancock writes that  proportionately  the death toll equaled  and almost certainly exceed ed   that of Jewish victims   300  Romani arrivals in the Belzec extermination camp  1940 Before being sent to the camps  the victims were herded into ghettos  including several hundred into the Warsaw Ghetto  92  Further east  teams of Einsatzgruppen tracked down Romani encampments and murdered the inhabitants on the spot  leaving no records of the victims  They were also targeted by the puppet regimes that cooperated with the Nazis  e g  the Usta e regime in Croatia  where a large number of Romani were killed in the Jasenovac concentration camp  The genocide analyst Helen Fein has stated that the Ustashe killed virtually every Romani in Croatia  301  In May 1942  the Romani were placed under the same labor and social laws as the Jews  On December 16  1942  Heinrich Himmler  Commander of the SS and regarded as the  architect  of the Nazi genocide  302  issued a decree that  Gypsy Mischlinge  mixed breeds   Romani  and members of the clans of Balkan origins who are not of German blood  should be sent to Auschwitz  unless they had served in the Wehrmacht  303  On January 29  1943  another decree ordered the deportation of all German Romani to Auschwitz  This was adjusted on November 15  1943  when Himmler ordered that  in the occupied Soviet areas   sedentary Gypsies and part Gypsies  Mischlinge  are to be treated as citizens of the country  Nomadic Gypsies and part Gypsies are to be placed on the same level as Jews and placed in concentration camps   304  Bauer argues that this adjustment reflected Nazi ideology that the Roma  originally an Aryan population  had been  spoiled  by non Romani blood  305  Persons of color Main articles  Black people in Nazi Germany and Racial policy of Nazi Germany Other  non Aryans  The number of black people in Germany when the Nazis came to power is variously estimated at 5 000 25 000  306  307  It is not clear whether these figures included Asians  According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum  Washington  D C    The fate of black people from 1933 to 1945 in Nazi Germany and in German occupied territories ranged from isolation to persecution  sterilization  medical experimentation  incarceration  brutality  and murder  However  there was no systematic program for their elimination as there was for Jews and other groups   307  Meanwhile  Afrikaaners  Berbers  Iranians and Pre Partition Indians were classified as Aryans  so not persecuted  see main article   Disabled and mentally ill  60 000 RM is what this person with genetic defects costs the community during his lifetime  Fellow German  308  that s your

the individual  We do not subscribe to the view that one should feed the hungry  give drink to the thirsty  or clothe the naked     Our objectives are different  We must have a healthy people in order to prevail in the world     Joseph Goebbels  1938  310  Action T4 was a program established in 1939 to maintain the genetic purity of the German population by killing or sterilizing German and Austrian citizens who were judged to be disabled or suffering from mental disorder  311  Between 1939 and 1941  80 000 to 100 000 mentally ill adults in institutions were killed  5 000 children in institutions  and 1 000 Jews in institutions  312  Outside the mental health institutions  the figures are estimated as 20 000  according to Dr  Georg Renno  the deputy director of Schloss Hartheim  one of the euthanasia centers  or 400 000  according to Frank Zeireis  the commandant of Mauthausen concentration camp   312  Another 300 000 were forcibly sterilized  313  Overall it has been estimated that over 200 000 individuals with mental disorders of all kinds were put to death  although their mass murder has received relatively little historical attention  Despite not being formally ordered to take part  psychiatrists and psychiatric institutions were at the center of justifying  planning and carrying out the atrocities at every stage  and  constituted the connection  to the later annihilation of Jews and other  undesirables  in the Holocaust  314  After strong protests by the German Catholic and Protestant churches on August 24  1941 Hitler ordered the cancellation of the T4 program  315  The program was named after Tiergartenstra e 4  the address of a villa in the Berlin borough of Tiergarten  the headquarters of the Gemeinn tzige Stiftung f r Heil und Anstaltspflege  General Foundation for Welfare and Institutional Care   316  led by Philipp Bouhler  head of Hitler s private chancellery  Kanzlei des F hrer der NSDAP  and Karl Brandt  Hitler s personal physician  Brandt was tried in December 1946 at Nuremberg  along with 22 others  in a case known as United States of America vs  Karl Brandt et al   also known as the Doctors  Trial  He was hanged at Landsberg Prison on June 2  1948  Homosexuals Main articles  Institut f r Sexualwissenschaft  Pink triangle  and Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust The Homomonument in Amsterdam  a memorial to the homosexual victims of Nazi Germany  Between 5 000 and 15 000 homosexuals of German nationality are estimated to have been sent to concentration camps  235  James D  Steakley writes that what mattered in Germany was criminal intent or character  rather than criminal acts  and the  gesundes Volksempfinden    healthy sensibility of the people   became the leading normative legal principle  317  In 1936  Himmler created the  Reichszentrale zur Bek mpfung der Homosexualit t und Abtreibung    Reich Central Office for the Combating of Homosexuality and Abortion    318  Homosexuality was declared contrary to  wholesome popular sentiment   235  and homosexuals were consequently regarded as  defilers of German blood   The Gestapo raided gay bars  tracked individuals using the address books of those they arrested  used the subscription lists of gay magazines to find others  and encouraged people to report suspected homosexual behavior and to scrutinize the behavior of their neighbours  235  317  Tens of thousands were convicted between 1933 and 1944 and sent to camps for  rehabilitation   where they were identified by yellow armbands 319  and later pink triangles worn on the left side of the jacket and the right trouser leg  which singled them out for sexual abuse  317  Hundreds were castrated by court order  320  They were humiliated  tortured  used in hormone experiments conducted by SS doctors  and killed  235  Steakley writes that the full extent of gay suffering was slow to emerge after the war  Many victims kept their stories to themselves because homosexuality remained criminalized in postwar Germany  Around two percent of German homosexuals were persecuted by Nazis  317  The political left German communists  socialists and trade unionists were among the earliest domestic opponents of Nazism 321  and were also among the first to be sent to concentration camps  Hitler claimed that communism was a Jewish ideology which the Nazis termed  Judeo Bolshevism   Fear of communist agitation was used as justification for the Enabling Act of 1933  the law which gave Hitler his original dictatorial powers  Hermann G ring later testified at the Nuremberg Trials that the Nazis  willingness to repress German communists prompted President Paul von Hindenburg and the German elite to cooperate with the Nazis  The first concentration camp was built at Dachau  in March 1933  to imprison German communists  socialists  trade unionists and others opposed to the Nazis  322  Communists  social democrats and other political prisoners were forced to wear a red triangle  Hitler and the Nazis also hated German leftists because of their resistance to the party s racism  Many leaders of German leftist groups were Jews  and Jews were especially prominent among the leaders of the Spartacist uprising in 1919  Hitler already referred to Marxism and  Bolshevism  as a means of  the international Jew  to undermine  racial purity  and survival of the Nordics or Aryans  as well to stir up socioeconomic class tension and labor unions against the government or state owned businesses  Within the concentration camps such as Buchenwald  German communists were privileged in comparison to Jews because of their  racial purity   323  Whenever the Nazis occupied a new territory  members of communist  socialist  or anarchist groups were normally to be the first persons detained or executed  Evidence of this is found in Hitler s infamous Commissar Order  in which he ordered the summary execution of all political commissars captured among Soviet soldiers  as well as the execution of all Communist Party members in German held territory  324  325 Einsatzgruppen carried out these executions in the east  326  Nacht und Nebel  German for  Night and Fog   was a directive  German  Erlass  of Hitler on December 7  1941 signed and implemented by Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces Wilhelm Keitel  resulting in kidnapping and disappearance of many political activists throughout Nazi Germany s occupied territories  Freemasons Main articles  Suppression of Freemasonry Nazi Germany and Occupied Europe and Nacht und Nebel A memorial for Loge Libert  ch rie  founded in November 1943 in Hut 6 of Emslandlager VII  KZ Esterwegen   one of two Masonic Lodges founded in a Nazi concentration camp  In Mein Kampf  Hitler wrote that Freemasonry had  succumbed  to the Jews   The general pacifistic paralysis of the national instinct of self preservation begun by Freemasonry is then transmitted to the masses of society by the Jewish press   327  Freemasons were sent to concentration camps as political prisoners  and forced to wear an inverted red triangle  328  The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum believes  because many of the Freemasons who were arrested were also Jews and or members of the political opposition  it is not known how many individuals were placed in Nazi concentration camps and or were targeted only because they were Freemasons   329  However  the Grand Lodge of Scotland estimates the number of Freemasons executed between 80 000 and 200 000  233  Jehovah s Witnesses Main article  Persecution of Jehovah s Witnesses in Nazi Germany Refusing to pledge allegiance to the Nazi party or to serve in the military  roughly 12 000 Jehovah s Witnesses were forced to wear a purple triangle and were placed in camps where they were given the option of renouncing their faith and submitting to the state s authority  Between 2 500 and 5 000 were killed  236  Historian Detlef Garbe  director at the Neuengamme  Hamburg  Memorial  writes that  no other religious movement resisted the pressure to conform to National Socialism with comparable unanimity and steadfastness   330  Uniqueness Dr  Shimon Samuels  director for International Liaison of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre  describes the acrimonious debate that exists between  specifists  and  universalists   The former fear debasement of the Holocaust by invidious comparisons  while the latter places the Holocaust alongside non Jewish experiences of mass extermination as part and parcel of the global context of genocide  Dr  Samuels considers the debate  ipso facto  to dishonour the memory of the respective victims of each genocide  In his words   Each case is specific as a threshold phenomenon  while each also adds its unique memory as signposts along an incremental continuum of horror   331 Adam Jones  professor at the University of British Columbia Okanagan  believes that claims of uniqueness for the Holocaust have become less common since the 1994 Rwandan genocide  332  In 1997  the publication of The Black Book of Communism led to further debate on the comparison between Soviet and Nazi crimes  the book argued that Nazi crimes were not very different from the Soviet ones  and that Nazi methods were to a significant extent adopted from Soviet methods  333  in the course of the debate  the term  Red Holocaust  appeared in discourse  334  335  In The Holocaust Industry  Norman Finkelstein writes that the uniqueness theory first appeared in public discourse in 1967  but that it does not figure in scholarship of the Nazi Holocaust  336  See also Related articles The Holocaust in Poland The Holocaust in Ukraine The Holocaust in Lithuania The Holocaust in Latvia The Holocaust in Estonia The Holocaust in
