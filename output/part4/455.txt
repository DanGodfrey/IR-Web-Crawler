sq mi   making it the 42nd most populous and 41st largest nation in the world  It is bordered by Pakistan in the south and the east  Iran in the west  Turkmenistan  Uzbekistan and Tajikistan in the north  and China in the far northeast  The territory of Afghanistan has been an ancient focal point of the Silk Road and human migration  Archaeologists have found evidence of human habitation from as far back as 50 000 BC  10  Urban civilization may have begun in the area as early as 3 000 to 2 000 BC  11  The country sits at an important geostrategic location that connects the Middle East with Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent  12  which has been home to various peoples through the ages  13  The land has witnessed many military campaigns since antiquity  notably by Alexander the Great  Chandragupta Maurya  Genghis Khan  the Soviet Union  and NATO  10  11  It has also served as a source from which local dynasties such as the Greco Bactrians  Kushans  Saffarids  Ghaznavids  Ghorids  Timurids  Mughals and many others have established empires of their own  14  The political history of modern Afghanistan begins in 1709 with the rise of the Pashtuns  when the Hotaki dynasty was established in Kandahar followed by Ahmad Shah Durrani s rise to power in 1747  2  15  16  The capital of Afghanistan was shifted in 1776 from Kandahar to Kabul and part of the Afghan Empire was ceded to neighboring empires by 1893  In the late 19th century  Afghanistan became a buffer state in the  Great Game  between the British and Russian empires  17  Following the third Anglo Afghan war and the signing of the Treaty of Rawalpindi in 1919  the nation regained control over its foreign policy from the British  After the 1978 Marxist revolution and 1979 Soviet invasion  a 9 year war took place between the US backed mujahideen rebel forces and the Soviet backed Afghan government in which over a million Afghans lost their lives mainly due to land mines  18  19  20  This was followed by the 1990s Afghan civil war  the rise and fall of the extremist Taliban government and the 2001 present war  21  In December 2001  the United Nations Security Council authorized the creation of the International Security Assistance Force  ISAF  to help maintain security in Afghanistan and assist the Karzai administration  22  The decades of war made Afghanistan the world s most dangerous country  23  including the largest producer of refugees and asylum seekers  While the international community is rebuilding war torn Afghanistan  terrorist groups such as the Haqqani network and Hezbi Islami 24  are actively involved in a nationwide Taliban led insurgency  25  which includes hundreds of assassinations and suicide attacks  26  According to the United Nations  the insurgents were responsible for 75  of civilian casualties in 2010 and 80  in 2011  27  28  Contents 1 Etymology 2 Geography 3 History 3 1 Pre Islamic period 3 2 Islamization and Mongol invasion 3 3 Afghan nation

mentioned several times in a 10th century geography book  Hudud al  alam  particularly where a reference is made to a village  Saul  a pleasant village on a mountain  In it live Afghans  33  Al Biruni referred to them in the 11th century as various tribes living on the western frontier mountains of the Indus River  which would be the Sulaiman Mountains  34 Ibn Battuta  a famous Moroccan scholar visiting the region in 1333  writes   We travelled on to Kabul  formerly a vast town  the site of which is now occupied by a village inhabited by a tribe of Persians called Afghans  They hold mountains and defiles and possess considerable strength  and are mostly highwaymen  Their principle mountain is called Kuh Sulayman   35  Afghan soldiers of the Durrani Empire  The name  Afghaunistan  is written on this 1847 Lithograph by James Rattray  One prominent 16th century Persian scholar explains extensively about the Afghans  For example  he writes  The men of K bul and Khilj also went home  and whenever they were ques tioned about the Musulm ns of the Kohist n  the mountains   and how matters stood there  they said   Don t call it Kohist n  but Afgh nist n  for there is nothing there but Afgh ns and dis turbances   Thus it is clear that for this reason the people of the country call their home in their own language Afgh nist n  and themselves Afgh ns  36   Firishta  1560 1620 AD It is widely accepted that the terms  Pashtun  and Afghan are synonyms  In the writings of the 17th century Pashto poet Khushal Khan Khattak it is mentioned  Pull out your sword and slay any one  that says Pashtun and Afghan are not one  Arabs know this and so do Romans  Afghans are Pashtuns  Pashtuns are Afghans  37  The last part of the name   st n is a Persian suffix for  place   prominent in many languages of the region  The name  Afghanistan  is described by the 16th century Mughal Emperor Babur in his memoirs as well as by the later Persian scholar Firishta and Babur s descendants  referring to the traditional ethnic Afghan  Pashtun  territories between the Hindu Kush mountains and the Indus River  38  In the early 19th century  Afghan politicians decided to adopt the name Afghanistan for the entire Afghan Empire after its English translation had already appeared in various treaties with Qajarid Persia and British India  39  In 1857  in his review of J W  Kaye s The Afghan War  Friedrich Engels describes  Afghanistan  as        an extensive country of Asia       between Persia and the Indies  and in the other direction between the Hindu Kush and the Indian Ocean  It formerly included the Persian provinces of Khorassan and Kohistan  together with Herat  Beluchistan  Cashmere  and Sinde  and a considerable part of the Punjab       Its principal cities are Kabul  the capital  Ghuznee  Peshawer  and Kandahar  40  The Afghan kingdom was sometimes referred to as the Kingdom of Kabul  as mentioned by the British statesman and historian Mountstuart

area were among the earliest in the world  10  60  61  An important site of early historical activities  many say that Afghanistan compares to Egypt in terms of the historical value of its archaeological sites  62  Afghanistan is at a unique nexus point where numerous civilizations have interacted and often fought  It has been home to various peoples through the ages  among them the ancient Iranian peoples who established the dominant role of Indo Iranian languages in the region  At multiple points  the land has been incorporated within large regional empires  among them the Achaemenid Empire  the Macedonian Empire  the Indian Maurya Empire  the Islamic Empire and the Sassanid Empire  Many kingdoms have also risen to power in what is now Afghanistan  such as the Greco Bactrians  Kushans  Hephthalites  Kabul Shahis  Saffarids  Samanids  Ghaznavids  Ghurids  Kartids  Timurids  Mughals  and finally the Hotaki and Durrani dynasties that marked the political origins of the modern state of Afghanistan  Pre Islamic period Main article  Pre Islamic period of Afghanistan Archaeological exploration done in the 20th century suggests that the geographical area of Afghanistan has been closely connected by the culture of and trade with neighboring regions to the east  west  and north  Artifacts typical of the Paleolithic  Mesolithic  Neolithic  Bronze  and Iron ages have been found in Afghanistan  63  Urban civilization may have begun as early as 3000 BCE  and the early city of Mundigak  near Kandahar in the south of the country  may have been a colony of the nearby Indus Valley Civilization  61  A 5th century BC carving of Median and Achaemenid soldiers  at a time when the region was known as Ariana  After 2000 BCE  successive waves of semi nomadic people from Central Asia moved south into the boundaries of modern Afghanistan  among them were many Indo European speaking Indo Iranians  60  These tribes later migrated further south to India  west to what is now Iran  and towards Europe via the area north of the Caspian  64  The region was called Ariana  60  65  66  The ancient Zoroastrianism religion is believed by some to have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 and 800 BCE  as its founder Zoroaster is thought to have lived and died in Balkh  67  68  69  Ancient Eastern Iranian languages may have been spoken in the region

Persia a year earlier in the Battle of Gaugamela  67  Following Alexander s brief occupation  the successor state of the Seleucid Empire controlled the area until 305 BCE when they gave much of it to the Indian Maurya Empire as part of an alliance treaty  Alexander took these away from the Aryans and established settlements of his own  but Seleucus Nicator gave them to Sandrocottus  Chandragupta   upon terms of intermarriage and of receiving in exchange 500 elephants  71   Strabo  64 BC   24 AD The Mauryans brought Buddhism from India and controlled the area south of the Hindu Kush until about 185 BCE when they were overthrown  72  Their decline began 60 years after Ashoka s rule ended  leading to the Hellenistic reconquest of the region by the Greco Bactrians  Much of it soon broke away from the Greco Bactrians and became part of the Indo Greek Kingdom  The Indo Greeks were defeated and expelled by the Indo Scythians in the late 2nd century BCE  During the 1st century BCE  the Parthian Empire subjugated the region  but lost it to their Indo Parthian vassals  In the mid to late 1st century CE the vast Kushan Empire  centered in modern Afghanistan  became great patrons of Buddhist culture  The Kushans were defeated by the Sassanids in the 3rd century CE  Although various rulers calling themselves Kushanshas  generally known as the Indo Sassanids  continued to rule at least parts of the region  they were probably more or less subject to the Sassanids  73  The late Kushans were followed by the Kidarite Huns 74  who  in turn  were replaced by the short lived but powerful Hephthalites  as rulers in the first half of the 5th century  75  The Hephthalites were defeated by Khosrau I in CE 557  who re established Sassanid power in Persia  However  in the 6th

Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age  82  60  By the 11th century the Ghaznavids had finally Islamized all of the remaining non Muslim areas  with the exception of the Kafiristan region  They were replaced by the Ghurids who expanded and advanced the already powerful empire  In 1219 AD  Genghis Khan and his Mongol barbarians overran the region  His troops are said to have annihilated the Khorasanian cities of Herat and Balkh  83  The destruction caused by the Mongols depopulated major cities and forced many of the locals to revert to an agrarian rural society  84  Mongol rule continued with the Ilkhanate in the northwest while the Khilji dynasty controlled the Afghan tribal areas south of the Hindu Kush  until the invasion of Timur who established the Timurid dynasty in 1370  85  During the Ghaznavid  Ghurid  and Timurid eras  Afghanistan produced many fine Islamic architectural monuments as well as numerous scientific and literary works  Babur  a descendant of both

and even controlled the state s foreign policy  In 1893  Mortimer Durand made Amir Abdur Rahman Khan sign a controversial agreement in which the ethnic Pashtun and Baloch territories were divided by the Durand Line  This was a standard divide and rule policy of the British and would lead to strained relations  especially with the later new state of Pakistan  King Amanullah Khan sitting next to German President Paul von Hindenburg in February 1928  His six month European tour initiated an alliance between Afghanistan and Germany  After the Third Anglo Afghan War and the signing of the Treaty of Rawalpindi in 1919  King Amanullah Khan declared Afghanistan a sovereign and fully independent state  He moved to end his country s traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the international community and  following a 1927 28 tour of Europe and Turkey  introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation  A key force behind these reforms was Mahmud Tarzi  an ardent supporter of the education of women  He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan s 1923 constitution  declared through a loya jirga   which made elementary education compulsory  Some of the reforms that were actually put in place  such as the abolition of the traditional burqa for women and the opening of a number of co educational schools  quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders  Faced with overwhelming armed opposition  Amanullah Khan was forced to abdicate in January 1929 after Kabul fell to rebel forces led by Habibullah Kalakani  Prince Mohammed Nadir Shah  Amanullah s cousin  in turn defeated and killed Kalakani in November 1929  and was declared King Nadir Shah  He abandoned the reforms of Amanullah Khan in favor of a more gradual approach to modernisation but was

began an experiment allowing greater political freedom  but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected  He was replaced in 1953 by Mohammed Daoud Khan  the king s cousin and brother in law  Daoud Khan sought a closer relationship with the Soviet Union and a more distant one towards Pakistan  Afghanistan remained neutral and was neither a participant in World War II  nor aligned with either power bloc in the Cold War  However  it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the Soviet Union and the United States vied for influence by building Afghanistan s main highways  airports and other vital infrastructure  By the late 1960s  many Western travelers were using these as part of the hippie trail  In 1973  while King Zahir Shah was on an official overseas visit  Daoud

Democratic Party of Afghanistan  PDPA   Mir Akbar Khyber  was mysteriously killed  Leaders of the PDPA feared that the government was planning to dismantle them because many were being arrested  Hafizullah Amin along with other PDPA members managed to remain at large and organised an uprising  The PDPA  led by Nur Mohammad Taraki  Babrak Karmal and Hafizullah Amin  overthrew the regime of Daoud by assassinating the President along with his family and relatives  Taraki quickly took over and moved to carry out an ill conceived land reform  which was misunderstood by virtually all Afghans  97  The PDPA began imprisoning  torturing and murdering thousands of members of the traditional elite  the religious establishment  and the intelligentsia  97  On the other hand  they prohibited usury  made statements on women s rights by declaring equality of the sexes 98  and introducing women to political life  98 Anahita Ratebzad was one of several female Marxist leaders and a member of

political ties with Pakistan although Zbigniew Brzezinski  National Security Advisor to U S  President Jimmy Carter  has warned that this might prompt a Soviet intervention  99  The Central Intelligence Agency  CIA  began using Pakistan s Inter Services Intelligence  ISI  as a proxy network to recruit  finance and arm the multi national Mujahideen fighters inside Pakistan  which was aimed to prevent the Soviet Union from reaching the oil rich Persian Gulf through Balochistan  18  In March 1979  Hafizullah Amin took over as Prime Minister of Afghanistan  retaining the position of field marshal and becoming Vice President of the Supreme Defence Council  Taraki remained the president and in control of the army until he was killed in September 1979  To bolster the Parcham faction and as part of its Cold War strategy to ultimately reach Gwadar in Balochistan  the Soviet Union decided to invade Afghanistan in December 1979 by sending 100 000 soldiers of the Red Army to its southern neighbor  In the meantime  Hafizullah Amin was killed and replaced by Babrak Karmal  In response to all these  the Reagan administration in the U S  increased arming and funding of the Mujahideen  thanks in large part to the efforts of Charlie Wilson and CIA officer Gust Avrakotos  Early reports estimated  6 20 billion 100  but more recent reports suggest that up to  40 billion were provided by the U S  and Saudi Arabia to Pakistan  101  102  This was in the forms of cash and weapons  which included over two thousand FIM 92 Stinger surface to air missiles  The money and weapons were directly given to Pakistani Armed Forces  which was distributed by its ISI network to various Mujahideen groups although much of it was secretly kept for Pakistan s own defense and other purposes  Despite receiving only minor aid compared to leaders of other Mujahideen groups  Ahmad Shah Massoud was named  the Afghan who won the Cold War  by the Wall Street Journal  103  The 10 year Soviet war resulted in the deaths of over 1 million Afghans  mostly civilians and due to land mines  18  19  20  104  About 6 million fled to Pakistan and Iran  and from there tens of thousands began emigrating to the European Union  United States  Australia and other parts of the world  105  Faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties  the Soviets withdrew in 1989 but continued to support Afghan President Mohammad Najibullah until 1992  106  Foreign interference and war Main articles  Civil war in Afghanistan  1989 1992  and Civil war in Afghanistan  1992 1996  Professor Burhanuddin Rabbani  President of the Islamic State of Afghanistan from 1992 to 1996  was assassinated by a Taliban member in September 2011  After the fall of Najibullah s government in 1992  the Afghan political parties agreed on a peace and power sharing agreement  the Peshawar Accords   The accords created the Islamic State of Afghanistan and appointed an interim government for a transitional period to be followed by general elections  According to Human Rights Watch  The sovereignty of Afghanistan was vested formally in the Islamic State of Afghanistan  an entity created in April 1992  after the fall of the Soviet backed Najibullah government        With the exception of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar s Hezb e Islami  all of the parties       were ostensibly unified under this government in April 1992        Hekmatyar s Hezb e Islami  for its part  refused to recognize the government for most of the period discussed in this report and launched attacks against government forces and Kabul generally        Shells and rockets fell everywhere  107  Gulbuddin Hekmatyar received operational  financial and military support from Pakistan  108  Afghanistan expert Amin Saikal concludes in Modern Afghanistan  A History of Struggle and Survival  Pakistan was keen to gear up for a breakthrough in Central Asia        Islamabad could not possibly expect the new Islamic government leaders       to subordinate their own nationalist objectives in order to help Pakistan realize its regional ambitions        Had it not been for the ISI s logistic support and supply of a large number of rockets  Hekmatyar s forces would not have been able to target and destroy half of Kabul  109  A section of Kabul during the civil war in 1993  In addition  Saudi Arabia and Iran   as competitors for regional hegemony   supported Afghan militias hostile towards each other  109  According to Human Rights Watch  Iran was backing the Shia Hazara Hezb i Wahdat forces of Abdul Ali Mazari in order to  maximize Wahdat s military power and influence   107  109  110  Saudi Arabia supported the Wahhabite Abdul Rasul Sayyaf and his Ittihad i Islami faction  107  109  A publication by the George Washington University describes   O utside forces saw instability in Afghanistan as an opportunity to press their own security and political agendas  111  Conflict between the two militias soon escalated into a full scale war  Due to the sudden initiation of the war  working government departments  police units or a system of justice and accountability for the newly created Islamic State of Afghanistan did not have time to form  Atrocities were committed by individuals of the different armed factions while Kabul descended into lawlessness and chaos as described in reports by Human Rights Watch and the Afghanistan Justice Project  107  112  Because of the chaos  some leaders increasingly had only nominal control over their  sub  commanders  113  For civilians there was little security from murder  rape and extortion  113  An estimated 25 000 people died during the most intense period of bombardment by Hekmatyar s Hezb i Islami and the Junbish i Milli forces of Abdul Rashid Dostum  who had created an alliance with Hekmatyar in 1994  112  Half a million people fled Afghanistan  113  Human Rights Watch writes  Rare ceasefires  usually negotiated by representatives of Ahmad Shah Massoud  Sibghatullah Mojaddedi or Burhanuddin Rabbani  the interim government   or officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross  ICRC   commonly collapsed within days  107  Southern and eastern Afghanistan was under the control of local commanders such as Gul Agha Sherzai and others  In 1994  the Taliban  a movement originating from Jamiat Ulema e Islam run religious schools for Afghan refugees in Pakistan  also developed in Afghanistan as a politico religious force  114  When the Taliban took control of the city in 1994  they forced the surrender of dozens of local Pashtun leaders  113  In 1994  the Taliban took power in several provinces in southern and central Afghanistan  In late 1994  most of the militia factions  Hezb i Islami  Junbish i Milli and Hezb i Wahdat  which had been fighting in the battle for control of Kabul were defeated militarily by forces of the Islamic State s Minister of Defense Ahmad Shah Massoud  Bombardment of the capital came to a halt  112  115  116  The Islamic State government took steps to restore law and order  117  Courts started to work again  117  Massoud tried to initiate a nationwide political process with the goal of national consolidation and democratic elections  also inviting the Taliban to join the process but they refused as they did not believe in a democratic system  118  Taliban

Amnesty International  referring to the Taliban offensive  wrote in a 1995 report   This is the first time in several months that Kabul civilians have become the targets of rocket attacks and shelling aimed at residential areas in the city   115  The Taliban s early victories in 1994 were followed by a series of defeats that resulted in heavy losses which led analysts to believe the Taliban movement had run its course  113  But Pakistan provided increased support to the Taliban  109  119  Many analysts like Amin Saikal describe the Taliban as developing into a proxy force for Pakistan s regional interests  109  On 26 September 1996  as the Taliban with military support by Pakistan and financial support by Saudi Arabia prepared for another major offensive  Massoud ordered a full retreat from Kabul  120  The Taliban seized Kabul on 27 September 1996  and established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan  They imposed on the parts of Afghanistan under their control their political and judicial interpretation of Islam issuing edicts especially targeting women  121  The Physicians for Human Rights  PHR  analyze   To PHR s knowledge  no other regime in the world has methodically and violently forced half of its population into virtual house arrest  prohibiting them on pain of physical punishment   121  After the fall of Kabul to the Taliban on 27 September 1996  Ahmad Shah Massoud and Abdul Rashid Dostum  two former enemies  created the United Front  Northern Alliance  against the Taliban that were preparing offensives against the remaining areas under the control of Massoud and those under the control of Dostum   see video  The United Front included beside the dominantly Tajik forces of Massoud and the Uzbek forces of Dostum  Hazara factions under the command of leaders such as Haji Mohammad Mohaqiq and Pashtun forces under the leadership of commanders such as Abdul Haq or Haji Abdul Qadir  The Taliban defeated Dostum s Junbish forces militarily by seizing Mazar i Sharif in 1998  Dostum subsequently went into exile  Pakistani journalist Hamid Mir interviewing al Qaida spiritual leader Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan in 1997 According to a 55 page report by the United Nations  the Taliban  while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan  committed systematic massacres against civilians  122  123  UN officials stated that there had been  15 massacres  between 1996 and 2001 and that   t hese have been highly systematic and they all lead back to the  Taliban  Ministry of Defense or to Mullah Omar himself   122  123  The Taliban especially targeted people of Shia religious or Hazara ethnic background  122  123  Upon taking Mazar i Sharif in 1998  4 000 6 000 civilians were killed by the Taliban and many more reported tortured  124  125  The documents also reveal the role of Arab and Pakistani support troops in these killings  122  123  Bin Laden s so called 055 Brigade was responsible for mass killings of Afghan civilians  126  The report by the UN quotes  eyewitnesses in many villages describing Arab fighters carrying long knives used for slitting throats and skinning people   122  123  Taliban religious police beating an Afghan woman because she removed her burqa in public  Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf   then as Chief of Army Staff   was responsible for sending thousands of Pakistanis to fight alongside the Taliban and bin Laden against the forces of Massoud  118  119  127  128  According to Pakistani Afghanistan expert Ahmed Rashid   between 1994 and 1999  an estimated 80 000 to 100 000 Pakistanis trained and fought in Afghanistan  on the side of the Taliban  129  In 2001 alone  there were believed to be 28 000 Pakistani nationals  many either from the Frontier Corps or army  fighting inside Afghanistan  118  An estimated 8 000 Pakistani militants were recruited in madrassas filling the ranks of the estimated 25 000 regular Taliban force  126  A 1998 document by the U S  State Department confirms that  20 40 percent of  regular  Taliban soldiers are Pakistani   119  The document further stated that the parents of those Pakistani nationals  know nothing regarding their child s military involvement with the Taliban until their bodies are brought back to Pakistan   119  From 1996 to 2001 the al Qaeda terrorist network of Osama bin Laden and Ayman al Zawahiri became a state within Afghanistan  130  Bin Laden sent Arab recruits to join the fight against the United Front  130  131  3 000 fighters of the regular Taliban army were Arab and Central Asian militants  126  In total  of roughly 45 000 Pakistani  Taliban and al Qaeda soldiers fighting against the forces of Massoud in mid 2001  only 14 000 were Afghans  118  126  Ahmad Shah Massoud remained the only leader of the United Front in Afghanistan  In the areas under his control Massoud set up democratic institutions and signed the Women s Rights Declaration  132  Human Rights Watch cites no human rights crimes for the forces under direct control of Massoud for the period from October 1996 until the assassination of Massoud in September 2001  133  As a consequence many civilians fled to the area of Ahmad Shah Massoud  127  134  In total  estimates range up to one million people fleeing the Taliban   see video  135 National Geographic concluded in its documentary  Inside the Taliban    The only thing standing in the way of future Taliban massacres is Ahmad Shah Massoud   127  In early 2001 Massoud addressed the European Parliament in Brussels asking the international community to provide humanitarian help to the people of Afghanistan  135  He stated that the Taliban and al Qaeda had introduced  a very wrong perception of Islam  and that without the support of Pakistan and bin Laden the Taliban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year  136  On this visit to Europe he also warned that his intelligence had gathered information about a large scale attack on U S  soil being imminent  137  Recent history  2001 present  Further information  War in Afghanistan  2001 present   Taliban insurgency  and Civilian casualties of the War in Afghanistan  2001

Massoud was assassinated by two Arab suicide attackers inside Afghanistan and two days later about 3 000 people became victims of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States  The US government identified Osama bin Laden  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the Al Qaeda organization based in and allied to the Taliban s Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as the perpetrators of the attacks  The Taliban refused to hand over bin Laden to US authorities and to disband al Qaeda bases in Afghanistan  In October 2001  Operation Enduring Freedom was launched in which teams of American and British special forces worked with ground forces of the United Front  Northern Alliance  to remove the Taliban from power and dispel Al Qaeda  138  At the same time the US led forces were bombing Taliban and al Qaida targets everywhere inside Afghanistan with cruise missiles  These actions led to the fall of Mazar i Sharif in the north followed by all the other cities  as the Taliban and al Qaida fled over the porous Durand Line border into Pakistan  In December 2001  after the Taliban government was toppled and the new Afghan government under Hamid Karzai was formed  the International Security Assistance Force  ISAF  was established by the UN Security Council to help assist the Karzai administration and provide basic security to the Afghan people  139  140  Five Taliban insurgents detained with 33 suicide vests and 1 000 kg of explosives  In most cases  the insurgents are poor and uneducated people from the Pakistan Afghan border areas who believe that killing pro Western Afghans and ISAF members in a suicide bombing will earn them a place in paradise  141  142  143  Clockwise  Admiral and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  Mike Mullen  standing with other top NATO military officials including David Petraeus  James Mattis  John Allen  Marvin Hill and Wolf Langheld of the German Army  While the Taliban began regrouping inside Pakistan  more coalition troops entered the escalating US led war  Meanwhile  the rebuilding of war torn Afghanistan kicked off in 2002  144  145  The Afghan nation was able to build democratic structures over the years  and some progress was made in key areas such as governance  economy  health  education  transport  and agriculture  NATO is training the Afghan armed forces as well its national police  ISAF and Afghan troops led many offensives against the Taliban but failed to fully defeat them  By 2009  a Taliban led shadow government began to form in many parts of the country complete with their own version of mediation court  146  After U S  President Barack Obama announced the deployment of another 30 000 soldiers in 2010 for a period of two years  Der Spiegel published images of the US soldiers who killed unarmed Afghan civilians  147  At the 2010 International Conference on Afghanistan in London  Afghan President Hamid Karzai said he intends to reach out to the Taliban leadership  including Mullah Omar  Sirajuddin Haqqani and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar   Supported by NATO  Karzai called on the group s leadership to take part in a loya jirga meeting to initiate peace talks  These steps have resulted in an intensification of bombings  assassinations and ambushes  148  Some Afghan groups  including the former intelligence chief Amrullah Saleh and opposition leader Dr  Abdullah Abdullah  believe that Karzai plans to appease the insurgents  senior leadership at the cost of the democratic constitution  the democratic process and progess in the field of human rights especially women s rights  149  Dr  Abdullah stated   I should say that Taliban are not fighting in order to be accommodated  They are fighting in order to bring the state down  So it s a futile exercise  and it s just misleading      There are groups that will fight to the death  Whether we like to talk to them or we don t like to talk to them  they will continue to fight  So  for them  I don t think that we have a way forward with talks or negotiations or contacts or anything as such  Then we have to be prepared to tackle and deal with them militarily  In terms of the Taliban on the ground  there are lots of possibilities and opportunities that with the help of the people in different parts of the country  we can attract them to the peace process  provided  we create a favorable environment on this side of the line  At the moment  the people are leaving support for the government because of corruption  So that expectation is also not realistic at this stage   150  Over five million Afghan refugees were repatriated in the last decade  including many who were forcefully deported from NATO countries  151  152  This large return of Afghans may have helped the nation s economy but the country still remains one of the poorest in the world due to the decades of war  lack of foreign investment  ongoing government corruption and the Pakistani backed Taliban insurgency  153  154  According to a report by the United Nations  the Taliban and other militants were responsible for 76  of civilian casualties in 2009  155  75  in 2010 27  and 80  in 2011  28  In 2011 a record 3 021 civilians were killed in the ongoing insurgency  the fifth successive annual rise  156  Ahmad Zia Massoud is the chairman of the National Front of Afghanistan    If the Taliban are imposed on Afghanistan  there will be resistance  157    After the May 2011 death of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan  many prominent Afghan figures began being assassinated  including Mohammed Daud Daud  Ahmad Wali Karzai  Jan Mohammad Khan  Ghulam Haider Hamidi  Burhanuddin Rabbani and others  26  Also in the same year  the Pak Afghan border skirmishes intensified and many large scale attacks by the Pakistani based Haqqani network took place across Afghanistan  This led to the United States warning Pakistan of a possible military action against the Haqqanis in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas  158  The U S  blamed Pakistan s government  mainly Pakistani Army and its ISI spy network as the masterminds behind all of this  25   In choosing to use violent extremism as an instrument of policy  the government of Pakistan  and most especially the Pakistani army and ISI  jeopardizes not only the prospect of our strategic partnership but Pakistan s opportunity to be a respected nation with legitimate regional influence  They may believe that by using these proxies  they are hedging their bets or redressing what they feel is an imbalance in regional power  But in reality  they have already lost that bet   159   Admiral Mike Mullen  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U S  Ambassador to Pakistan  Cameron Munter  told Radio Pakistan that  The attack that took place in Kabul a few days ago  that was the work of the Haqqani network  There is evidence linking the Haqqani Network to the Pakistan government  This is something that must stop   160  Other top U S  officials such as Hillary Clinton and Leon Panetta made similar statements  161  25  On 16 October 2011   Operation Knife Edge  was launched by NATO and Afghan forces against the Haqqani network in south eastern Afghanistan  Afghan Defense Minister  Abdul Rahim Wardak  explained that the operation will  help eliminate the insurgents before they struck in areas along the troubled frontier   162  In anticipation of the 2014 NATO withdrawal and a

 the 2009 presidential election was characterized by lack of security  low voter turnout and widespread electoral fraud  171  172  The vote  along with elections for 420 provincial council seats  took place in August 2009  but remained unresolved during a lengthy period of vote counting and fraud investigation  173  Two months later  under international pressure  a second round run off vote between Karzai and remaining challenger Abdullah was announced  but a few days later Abdullah announced that he is not participating in the 7 November run off because his demands for changes in the electoral
