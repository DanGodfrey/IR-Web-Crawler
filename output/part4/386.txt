giving the creator of an original work exclusive rights to it  usually for a limited time  Generally  it is  the right to copy   but also gives the copyright holder the right to be credited for the work  to determine who may adapt the work to other forms  who may perform the work  who may financially benefit from it  and other related rights  It is an intellectual property form  like the patent  the trademark  and the trade secret  applicable to any expressible form of an idea or information that is substantive and discrete  1  Copyright initially was conceived as a way for government to restrict printing  the contemporary intent of copyright is to promote the creation of new works by giving authors control of and profit from them  Copyrights are said to be territorial  which means that they do not extend beyond the territory of a specific state unless that state is a party to an international agreement  Today  however  this is less relevant since most countries are parties to at least one such agreement  While many aspects of national copyright laws have been standardized through international copyright agreements  copyright laws of most countries have some unique features  2  Typically  the duration of copyright is the whole life of the creator plus fifty to a hundred years from the creator s death  or a finite period for anonymous or corporate creations  Some jurisdictions have required formalities to establishing copyright  but most recognize copyright in any completed work  without formal registration  Generally  copyright is enforced as a civil matter  though some jurisdictions do apply criminal sanctions  Most jurisdictions recognize copyright limitations  allowing  fair  exceptions to the creator s exclusivity of copyright  and giving users certain rights  The development of digital media and computer network technologies have prompted reinterpretation of these exceptions  introduced new difficulties in enforcing copyright  and inspired additional challenges to copyright law s philosophic basis  Simultaneously  businesses with great economic dependence upon copyright have advocated the extension and expansion of their copy rights  and sought additional legal and technological enforcement  Contents 1 Justification 2 History 3 Scope 4 Obtaining and enforcing copyright 4 1 Cost of enforcing copyright 4 2 Copyright notices in the U

take the approach of looking for coherent justifications of established copyright systems  while others start with general ethical theories  such as utilitarianism and try to analyse policy through that lens  Another approach denies the meaningfulness of any ethical justification for existing copyright law  viewing it simply as a result  and perhaps an undesirable result  of political processes  Another widely debated issue is the relationship between copyrights and other forms of  intellectual property   and material property  Most scholars of copyright agree that it can be called a kind of property  because it involves the exclusion of others from something  But there is disagreement about the extent to which that fact should allow the transportation of other beliefs and intuitions about material possessions  There are many other philosophical questions which arise in the jurisprudence of copyright  They include such problems as determining when one work is  derived  from another  or deciding when information has been placed in a  tangible  or  material  form  Some critics claim copyright law protects corporate interests while criminalizing legitimate use  while proponents argue the law is fair and just  3   edit  History Main article  History of copyright law See also  Statute of Anne  United States copyright law  International copyright agreements  Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works  and Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Copyright was invented after the advent of the printing press and with wider public literacy  As a legal concept  its origins in Britain were from a reaction to printers  monopolies at the beginning of the eighteenth century  Charles II of England was concerned by the unregulated copying of books and passed the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 by Act of Parliament  4  which established a register of licensed books and required a copy to be deposited with the Stationers  Company  essentially continuing the licensing of material that had long been in effect  The Statute of Anne came into force in 1710 The British Statute of Anne  1709  further alluded to individual rights of the artist  beginning   Whereas Printers  Booksellers  and other Persons  have of late frequently taken the Liberty of Printing    Books  and other Writings  without the Consent of the Authors    to their very great Detriment  and too often to the Ruin of them and their Families      5  A right to benefit financially from the work is articulated  and court rulings and legislation have recognized a right to control the work  such as ensuring that the integrity of it is preserved  An irrevocable right to be recognized as the work s creator appears in some countries  copyright laws  Aside from the role of governments and the church  the history of copyright law is in essential ways also connected to the rise of capitalism and the attendant extension of commodity relations to the realm of creative human activities  such as literary and artistic production  Similarly  different cultural attitudes  social organizations  economic models and legal frameworks are seen to account for why copyright emerged in Europe and not  for example  in Asia  In the Middle Ages in Europe  there was generally a lack of any concept of literary property due to the general relations of production  the specific organization of literary production and the role of culture in society  The latter refers to the tendency of oral societies  such as that of Europe in the medieval period  to view knowledge as the product  expression and property of the collective  Not until capitalism emerges in Europe with its individualist ideological underpinnings does the conception of intellectual property and by extension copyright law emerge  Intellectual production comes to be seen as a product of an individual and their property  rather than a collective or social product which belongs in the commons  The most significant point is that under the capitalist mode of production  patent and copyright laws support in fundamental and thoroughgoing ways the expansion of the range of creative human activities that can be commodified  This parallels the ways in which capitalism led to the commodification of many aspects of social life that hitherto had no monetary or economic value per se  6  The Statute of Anne was the first real copyright act  and gave the publishers rights for a fixed period  after which the copyright expired  7  Copyright has grown from a legal concept regulating copying rights in the publishing of books and maps to one with a significant effect on nearly every modern industry  covering such items as sound recordings  films  photographs  software  and architectural works  The Copyright Act of 1790 in the Columbian Centinel The Copyright Clause of the United States Constitution  1787  authorized copyright legislation   To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts  by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries   That is  by guaranteeing them a period of time in which they alone could profit from their works  they would be enabled and encouraged to invest the time required to create them  and this would be good for society as a whole  A right to profit from the work has been the philosophical underpinning for much legislation extending the duration of copyright  to the life of the creator and beyond  to his heirs  The original length of copyright in the US was 14 years  and it had to be explicitly applied for  If the author wished  he could apply for a second 14 year monopoly grant  but after that the work entered the public domain  so it could be used and built upon by others  Thomas Jefferson  who strongly advocated the ability of the public to share and build upon the works of others  proposed as part of the Bill of Rights that a short timespan be protected  Art  9  Monopolies may be allowed to persons for their own productions in literature and their own inventions in the arts for a term not exceeding   years but for no longer term and no other purpose  8  The 1886 Berne Convention first established recognition of copyrights among sovereign nations  rather than merely bilaterally  Under the Berne Convention  copyrights for creative works do not have to be asserted or declared  as they are automatically in force at creation  an author need not  register  or  apply for  a copyright in countries adhering to the Berne Convention  9  As soon as a work is  fixed   that is  written or recorded on some physical medium  its author is automatically entitled to all copyrights in the work  and to any derivative works unless and until the author explicitly disclaims them  or until the copyright expires  The Berne Convention also resulted in foreign authors being treated equivalently to domestic authors  in any country signed onto the Convention  The UK signed the Berne Convention in 1887 but did not implement large parts of it until 100 years later with the passage of the Copyright  Designs and Patents Act of 1988  The USA did not sign the Berne Convention until 1989  10  The United States and most Latin American countries instead entered into the Buenos Aires Convention in 1910  which required a copyright notice  such as  all rights reserved   on the work  and permitted signatory nations to limit the duration of copyrights to shorter and renewable terms  11  12  13  The Universal Copyright Convention was drafted in 1952 as another less demanding alternative to the Berne Convention  and ratified by nations such as the Soviet Union and developing nations  The regulations of the Berne Convention are incorporated into the World Trade Organization s TRIPS agreement  1995   thus giving the Berne Convention effectively near global application  14  The 2002 WIPO Copyright Treaty enacted greater restrictions on the use of technology to copy works in the nations that ratified it  With the intense lobbying of Disney  each time its works came close to entering into the public domain under normal conditions  the US Congress has extended copyright length  until it s gone from the original 14 years  after which the work would become available to the public to build upon  to 70 years after the death of the author   edit  Scope Copyright may apply to a wide range of creative  intellectual  or artistic forms  or  works   Specifics vary by jurisdiction  but these can include poems  theses  plays  other literary works  movies  dances  musical compositions  audio recordings  paintings  drawings  sculptures  photographs  software  radio and television broadcasts  and industrial designs  Graphic designs and industrial designs may have separate or overlapping laws applied to them in some jurisdictions  15  16  Copyright does not cover ideas and information themselves  only the form or manner in which they are expressed  17  For example  the copyright to a Mickey Mouse cartoon restricts others from making copies of the cartoon or creating derivative works based on Disney s particular anthropomorphic mouse  but does not prohibit the creation of other works about anthropomorphic mice in general  so long as they are different enough to not be judged copies of Disney s  17  In many jurisdictions  copyright law makes exceptions to these restrictions when the work is copied for the purpose of commentary or other related uses  See Fair Use  Fair Dealing   Meanwhile  other laws may impose additional restrictions that copyright does not   such as trademarks and patents  Copyright laws are standardized somewhat through international conventions such as the Berne Convention and Universal Copyright Convention  These multilateral treaties have been ratified by nearly all countries  and international organizations such as the European Union or World Trade Organization require their member states to comply with them   edit  Obtaining and enforcing copyright A copyright certificate for proof of the Fermat theorem  issued by the State Department of Intellectual Property of Ukraine Typically  a work must meet minimal standards of originality in order to qualify for copyright  and the copyright expires after a set period of time  some jurisdictions may allow this to be extended   Different countries impose different tests  although generally the requirements are low  in the United Kingdom there has to be some  skill  labour and judgment  that has gone into it  18  In Australia and the United Kingdom it has been held that a single word is insufficient to comprise a copyright work  However  single words or a short string of words can sometimes be registered as a trademark instead  Copyright law recognises the right of an author based on whether the work actually is an original creation  rather than based on whether it is unique  two authors may own copyright on two substantially identical works  if it is determined that the duplication was coincidental  and neither was copied from the other  In all countries where the Berne Convention standards apply  copyright is automatic  and need not be obtained through official registration with any government office  Once an idea has been reduced to tangible form  for example by securing it in a fixed medium  such as a drawing  sheet music  photograph  a videotape  or a computer file   the copyright holder is entitled to enforce his or her exclusive rights  9  However  while registration isn t needed to exercise copyright  in jurisdictions where the laws provide for registration  it serves as prima facie evidence of a valid copyright and enables the copyright holder to seek statutory damages and attorney s fees   In the USA  registering after an infringement only enables one to receive actual damages and lost profits   The original holder of the copyright may be the employer of the author rather than the author himself  if the work is a  work for hire   19  For example  in English law the Copyright  Designs and Patents Act 1988 provides that if a copyrighted work is made by an employee in the course of that employment  the copyright is automatically owned by the employer which would be a  Work for Hire   Copyrights are generally enforced by the holder in a civil law court  but there are also criminal infringement statutes in some jurisdictions  While central registries are kept in some countries which aid in proving claims of ownership  registering does not necessarily prove ownership  nor does the fact of copying  even without permission  necessarily prove that copyright was infringed  Criminal sanctions are generally aimed at serious counterfeiting activity  but are now becoming more commonplace as copyright collectives such as the RIAA are increasingly targeting the file sharing home Internet user  Thus far  however  most such cases against file sharers have been settled out of court   See  File sharing and the law   edit  Cost of enforcing copyright In most jurisdictions the copyright holder must bear the cost of enforcing copyright  This will usually involve engaging legal representation  administrative and or court costs  These costs  including time  should be taken into consideration when evaluating the benefits of enforcing copyright  In light of this many copyright disputes are settled by a direct approach to the infringing party in order to settle the dispute out of court   edit  Copyright notices in the U S  A copyright symbol used in copyright notice Prior to 1989  use of a copyright notice   consisting of the copyright symbol     the letter C inside a circle   the abbreviation  Copr    or the word  Copyright   followed by the year of the first publication of the work and the name of the copyright holder   was part of United States statutory requirements  20  21  Several years may be noted if the work has gone through substantial revisions  The proper copyright notice for sound recordings of musical or other audio works is a sound recording copyright symbol     the letter P inside a circle   which indicates a sound recording copyright  with the letter  p  indicating a  phonorecord   Similarly  the phrase All rights reserved was once required to assert copyright  In 1989  the U S  enacted the Berne Convention Implementation Act  amending the 1976 Copyright Act to conform to most of the provisions of the Berne Convention  As a result  the use of copyright notices has become optional to claim copyright  because the Berne Convention makes copyright automatic  22  However  the lack of notice of copyright using these marks may have consequences in terms of reduced damages in an infringement lawsuit   using notices of this form may reduce the likelihood of a defense of  innocent infringement  being successful  23   edit   Poor man s copyright  Main article  Poor man s copyright A widely circulated strategy to avoid the cost of copyright registration is referred to as the  poor man s copyright   It proposes that the creator send the work to himself in a sealed envelope by registered mail  using the postmark to establish the date  This technique has not been recognized in any published opinions of the United States courts  The United States Copyright Office makes it clear that the technique is no substitute for actual registration  24  The United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office discusses the technique but does not recommend its use  25  26   edit  Exclusive rights Several exclusive rights typically attach to the holder of a copyright  to produce copies or reproductions of the work and to sell those copies  including  typically  electronic copies  to import or export the work to create derivative works  works that adapt the original work  to perform or display the work publicly to sell or assign these rights to others to transmit or display by radio or video 15  The phrase  exclusive right  means that only the copyright holder is free to exercise those rights  and others are prohibited from using the work without the holders permission  Copyright is sometimes called a  negative right   as it serves to prohibit certain people  e g   readers  viewers  or listeners  and primarily publishers and would be publishers  from doing something they would otherwise be able to do  rather than permitting people  e g   authors  to do something they would otherwise be unable to do  In this way it is similar to the unregistered design right in English law and European law  The rights of the copyright holder also permit him her to not use or exploit their copyright  for some or all of the term  There is  however  a critique which rejects this assertion as being based on a philosophical interpretation of copyright law that is not universally shared  There is also debate on whether copyright should be considered a property right or a moral right  citation needed   edit  Useful articles If a pictorial  graphic or sculptural work is a useful article  it is copyrighted only if its aesthetic features are separable from its utilitarian features  A useful article is an article having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information  They must be separable from the functional aspect to be copyrighted  27   edit  Limitations and exceptions to copyright Main article  Limitations and exceptions to copyright  edit  Idea expression dichotomy and the merger doctrine Main article  Idea expression divide The idea expression divide differentiates between ideas and expression  and states that copyright protects only the original expression of ideas  and not the ideas themselves  This principle  first clarified in the 1879 case of Baker v  Selden  has since been codified by the Copyright Act of 1976 at 17 U S C    102 b    edit  The first sale doctrine and exhaustion of rights Main articles  First sale doctrine and Exhaustion of rights Copyright law does not restrict the owner of a copy from reselling legitimately obtained copies of copyrighted works  provided that those copies were originally produced by or with the permission of the copyright holder  It is therefore legal  for example  to resell a copyrighted book or CD  In the United States this is known as the first sale doctrine  and was established by the courts to clarify the legality of reselling books in second hand bookstores  Some countries may have parallel importation restrictions that allow the copyright holder to control the aftermarket  This may mean for example that a copy of a book that does not infringe copyright in the country where it was printed does infringe copyright in a country into which it is imported for retailing  The first sale doctrine is known as exhaustion of rights in other countries and is a principle which also applies  though somewhat differently  to patent and trademark rights  It is important to note that the first sale doctrine permits the transfer of the particular legitimate copy involved  It does not permit making or distributing additional copies  In addition  copyright  in most cases  does not prohibit one from acts such as modifying  defacing  or destroying his or her own legitimately obtained copy of a copyrighted work  so long as duplication is not involved  However  in countries that implement moral rights  a copyright holder can in some cases successfully prevent the mutilation or destruction of a work that is publicly visible   edit  Fair use and fair dealing Main articles  Fair use and Fair dealing Copyright does not prohibit all copying or replication  In the United States  the fair use doctrine  codified by the Copyright Act of 1976 as 17 U S C  Section 107  permits some copying and distribution without permission of the copyright holder or payment to same  The statute does not clearly define fair use  but instead gives four non exclusive factors to consider in a fair use analysis  Those factors are  the purpose and character of your use the nature of the copyrighted work what amount and proportion of the whole work was taken  and the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work  28  In the United Kingdom and many other Commonwealth countries  a similar notion of fair dealing was established by the courts or through legislation  The concept is sometimes not well defined  however in Canada  private copying for personal use has been expressly permitted by statute since 1999  In Australia  the fair dealing exceptions under the Copyright Act 1968  Cth  are a limited set of circumstances under which copyrighted material can be legally copied or adapted without the copyright holder s consent  Fair dealing uses are research and study  review and critique  news reportage and the giving of professional advice  i e  legal advice   Under current Australian law it is still a breach of copyright to copy  reproduce or adapt copyright material for personal or private use without permission from the copyright owner  Other technical exemptions from infringement may also apply  such as the temporary reproduction of a work in machine readable form for a computer  In the United States the AHRA  Audio Home Recording Act Codified in Section 10  1992  prohibits action against consumers making noncommercial recordings of music  in return for royalties on both media and devices plus mandatory copy control mechanisms on recorders  Section 1008  Prohibition on certain infringement actions No action may be brought under this title alleging infringement of copyright based on the manufacture  importation  or distribution of a digital audio recording device  a digital audio recording medium  an analog recording device  or an analog recording medium  or based on the noncommercial use by a consumer of such a device or medium for making digital musical recordings or analog musical recordings  29  Later acts amended US Copyright law so that for certain purposes making 10 copies or more is construed to be commercial  but there is no general rule permitting such copying  Indeed making one complete copy of a work  or in many cases using a portion of it  for commercial purposes will not be considered fair use  The Digital Millennium Copyright Act prohibits the manufacture  importation  or distribution of devices whose intended use  or only significant commercial use  is to bypass an access or copy control put in place by a copyright owner  15  An appellate court has held that fair use is not a defense to engaging in such distribution   edit  Accessible copies It is legal in several countries including the United Kingdom and the United States to produce alternative versions  for example  in large print or braille  of a copyrighted work to provide improved access to a work for blind and visually impaired persons without permission from the copyright holder  30  31   edit  Transfer and licensing  and assignment See also  Collective rights management  extended collective licensing  Compulsory license  and Copyright transfer agreement DVD All Rights Reserved A copyright  or aspects of it  may be assigned or transferred from one party to another  32  For example  a musician who records an album will often sign an agreement with a record company in which the musician agrees to transfer all copyright in the recordings in exchange for royalties and other considerations  The creator  and original copyright holder  benefits  or expects to  from production and marketing capabilities far beyond those of the author  In the digital age of music  music may be copied and distributed at minimal cost through the Internet  however the record industry attempts to provide promotion and marketing for the artist and his or her work so it can reach a much larger audience  A copyright holder need not transfer all rights completely  though many publishers will insist  Some of the rights may be transferred  or else the copyright holder may grant another party a non exclusive license to copy and or distribute the work in a particular region or for a specified period of time  A transfer or licence may have to meet particular formal requirements in order to be effective  33  for example under the Australian Copyright Act 1968 the copyright itself must be expressly transferred in writing  Under the U S  Copyright Act  a transfer of ownership in copyright must be memorialized in a writing signed by the transferor  For that purpose  ownership in copyright includes exclusive licenses of rights  Thus exclusive licenses  to be effective  must be granted in a written instrument signed by the grantor  No special form of transfer or grant is required  A simple document that identifies the work involved and the rights being granted is sufficient  Non exclusive grants  often called non exclusive licenses  need not be in writing under U S  law  They can be oral or even implied by the behavior of the parties  Transfers of copyright ownership  including exclusive licenses  may and should be recorded in the U S  Copyright Office   Information on recording transfers is available on the Office s web site   While recording is not required to make the grant effective  it offers important benefits  much like those obtained by recording a deed in a real estate transaction  Copyright may also be licensed  32  Some jurisdictions may provide that certain classes of copyrighted works be made available under a prescribed statutory license  e g  musical works in the United States used for radio broadcast or performance   This is also called a compulsory license  because under this scheme  anyone who wishes to copy a covered work does not need the permission of the copyright holder  but instead merely files the proper notice and pays a set fee established by statute  or by an agency decision under statutory guidance  for every copy made  34  Failure to follow the proper procedures would place the copier at risk of an infringement suit  Because of the difficulty of following every individual work  copyright collectives or collecting societies and performing rights organizations  such as ASCAP  BMI  and SESAC have been formed to collect royalties for hundreds  thousands and more  works at once  Though this market solution bypasses the statutory license  the availability of the statutory fee still helps dictate the price per work collective rights organizations charge  driving it down to what avoidance of procedural hassle would justify   edit  Creative Commons Founded in 2001  Creative Commons  CC  is a non profit organization 35  which aims to facilitate the legal sharing of creative works  To this end the organization provides a number of copyright license options to the public  free of charge  These licenses allow copyright holders to define conditions under which others may use a work and to specify what types of use are acceptable  35  Terms of use have traditionally been negotiated on an individual basis between copyright holder and potential licensee  Therefore  a general CC license outlining which rights the copyright holder is willing to waive enable the general public to use such works more freely  Four general types of CC licenses are available  These are based upon copyright holder stipulations such as whether he or she is willing to allow modifications to the work  whether he or she permits the creation of derivative works and whether he or she is willing to permit commercial use of the work  36  Individuals may register for a CC license via the Creative Commons website  As of 2009 approximately 130 million individuals had received such licenses  36   edit  Duration  edit  Copyright term Main articles  copyright term and List of countries  copyright length Expansion of U S  copyright law  Assuming authors create their works at age 35 and live for seventy years  Copyright subsists for a variety of lengths in different jurisdictions  The length of the term can depend on several factors  including the type of work  e g  musical composition  novel   whether the work has been published  and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation  In most of the world  the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years  In the United States  the term for most existing works is a fixed number of years after the date of creation or publication  Under most countries  laws  for example  the United States 37  and the United Kingdom 38    copyrights expire at the end of the calendar year in question  The length and requirements for copyright duration are subject to change by legislation  and since the early 20th century there have been a number of adjustments made in various countries  which can make determining the duration of a given copyright somewhat difficult  For example  the United States used to require copyrights to be renewed after 28 years to stay in force  and formerly required a copyright notice upon first publication to gain coverage  In Italy and France  there were post wartime extensions that could increase the term by approximately 6 years in Italy and up to about 14 in France  Many countries have extended the length of their copyright terms  sometimes retroactively   International treaties establish minimum terms for copyrights  but individual countries may enforce longer terms than those  39  In the United States  all books and other works published before 1923 have expired copyrights and are in the public domain  40  In addition  works published before 1964 that did not have their copyrights renewed 28 years after first publication year also are in the public domain  except that books originally published outside the US by non Americans are exempt from this requirement  if they are still under copyright in their home country  see How Can I Tell Whether a Copyright Was Renewed for more details   But if the intended exploitation of the work includes publication  or distribution of derivative work  such as a film based on a book protected by copyright  outside the U S   the terms of copyright around the world must be considered  If the author has been dead more than 70 years  the work is in the public domain in most  but not all  countries  Some works are covered by copyright in Spain for 80 years after the author s death  41  In 1998 the length of a copyright in the United States was increased by 20 years under the The Copyright Term Extension Act  This legislation was strongly promoted by corporations which had valuable copyrights which otherwise would have expired  and has been the subject of substantial criticism on this point  42  As a curiosity  the famous work Peter Pan  or The Boy Who Wouldn t Grow Up has a complex   and disputed   story of copyright expiry  43   edit  Public domain Main article  Public domain Copyright  like other intellectual property rights is subject to a statutorily determined term  Once the term of a copyright has expired  the formerly copyrighted work enters the public domain and may be freely used or exploited by anyone  Courts in the United States and the United Kingdom have rejected the doctrine of a common law copyright  Public domain works should not be confused with works that are publicly available  Works posted in the internet for example  are publicly available  but are not generally in the public domain  Copying such works may therefore violate the author s copyright   edit  Copyright infringement Main article  Copyright infringement Street hackers and mp3 pirates in Afghanistan Piracy is considered to be the illegitimate use of materials held by copyright  44  For the history of the term  piracy  see Copyright infringement  For a work to be considered pirated  its illegitimate use must have occurred in a nation that has domestic copyright laws and or adheres to a bilateral treaty or established international convention such as the Berne Convention or WIPO Copyright Treaty  Improper use of materials outside of this legislation is deemed  unauthorized edition   not piracy  45  Piracy primarily targets software  film and music  However  the illegal copying of books and other text works remains common  especially for educational reasons  Statistics regarding the effects of piracy are difficult to determine  Studies have attempted to estimate a monetary loss for industries affected by piracy by predicting what portion of pirated works would have been formally purchased if they had not been freely available  46  Estimates in 2007 stated 18 2 billion potential losses in consumer dollars lost as a result of piracy activities in the United States  47  International estimates suggest losses in the billions throughout the last decade  47  However other reports indicate that piracy does not have an adverse effect on the entertainment industry  48   edit  See also Philosophy portal Law portal Adelphi Charter Anti copyright Copyfraud
