radioactive decay  in which an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle  and thereby transforms  or  decays   into an atom with a mass number 4 less and atomic number 2 less  Many other types of decays are possible  Radioactive decay is the process by which an atomic nucleus of an unstable atom loses energy by emitting ionizing particles  ionizing radiation   The emission is spontaneous  in that the atom decays without any physical interaction with another particle from outside the atom  Usually  radioactive decay happens due to a process confined to the nucleus of the unstable atom  but  on occasion  as with the different processes of electron capture and internal conversion   an inner electron of the radioactive atom is also necessary to the process  Radioactive decay is a stochastic  i e   random  process at the level of single atoms  in that  according to quantum theory  it is impossible to predict when a given atom will decay  1  However  the chance that a given atom will decay is constant over time  For a large number of identical atoms  of the same nuclide   the decay rate for the collection is predictable to the extent allowed by the law of large numbers  and is easily calculated from the measured decay constant of the nuclide  or equivalently from the half life   The decay  or loss of energy  results when an atom with one type of nucleus  called the parent radionuclide  transforms to an atom with a nucleus in a different state  or a different nucleus  either of which is named the daughter nuclide  Often the parent and daughter are different chemical elements  and in such cases the decay process results in nuclear transmutation  In an example of this  a carbon 14 atom  the  parent   emits radiation  a beta particle  antineutrino  and a gamma ray  and transforms to a nitrogen 14 atom  the  daughter    By contrast  there exist two types of radioactive decay processes  gamma decay and internal conversion decay  that do not result in transmutation  but only decrease the energy of an excited nucleus  This results in an atom of the same element as before but with a nucleus in a lower energy state  An example is the nuclear isomer technetium 99m decaying  by the emission of a gamma ray  to an atom of technetium 99  Nuclides produced by radioactive decay are called radiogenic nuclides  whether they themselves are stable or not  There exist stable radiogenic nuclides that were formed from short lived extinct radionuclides in the early solar system  2  3  The extra presence of these stable radiogenic nuclides  such as Xe 129 from primordial I 129  against the background of primordial stable nuclides can be inferred by various means  Presently radioactive nuclides are from three sources  many naturally occurring radionuclides are short lived radiogenic nuclides that are the daughters of ongoing radioactive primordial nuclides  types of radioactive atoms that have been present since the beginning of the Earth and solar system   Other naturally occurring radioactive nuclides are cosmogenic nuclides  formed by cosmic ray bombardment of material in the Earth s atmosphere or crust  Finally  some primordial nuclides are radioactive  but are so long lived that they remain present from the primordial solar nebula  For a summary table showing the number of stable nuclides and of radioactive nuclides in each category  see radionuclide  Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by the French scientist Henri Becquerel  while working on phosphorescent materials  During experiments to see if phosphorescent materials would expose photographic materials through black paper in the manner of the recently discovered X rays  which produced fluorescense  Becquerel used a phosphorescent uranium salt and eventually found that it blackened the plate through paper wrapping  in a desk drawer over a weekend  even without application of light  or production of its phosphorescence  These penetrating radiations  accidentally discovered emanating from uranium minerals  were first called Becquerel rays  The SI unit of radioactive activity is the becquerel  Bq   in honor of the scientist  One Bq is defined as one transformation  or decay  per second  Since sensible sizes of radioactive material contains many atoms  a Bq is a tiny measure of activity  amounts giving activities on the order of GBq  gigabecquerel  1 x 109 decays per second  or TBq  terabecquerel  1 x 1012 decays per second  are commonly used  Contents 1 Explanation 2 Discovery 3 Danger of radioactive substances 4 Types of decay 5 Decay modes

radioactive danger symbol is used to indicate dangerous ionizing radioactive material  The neutrons and protons that constitute nuclei  as well as other particles that approach close enough to them  are governed by several interactions  The strong nuclear force  not observed at the familiar macroscopic scale  is the most powerful force over subatomic distances  The electrostatic force is almost always significant  and  in the case of beta decay  the weak nuclear force is also involved  The interplay of these forces produces a number of different phenomena in which energy may be released by rearrangement of particles in the nucleus  or else the change of one type of particle into others  These rearrangements and transformations may be hindered energetically  so that they do not occur immediately  In certain cases  random quantum vacuum fluctuations are theorized to promote relaxation to a lower energy state  the  decay   in a phenomenon known as quantum tunneling  Radioactive decay half life of nuclides has been measured over timescales of 55 orders of magnitude  from 2 3 x 10 23 second  for hydrogen 7  to 6 9 x 1031 seconds  for tellurium 128  4   The limits of these timescales are set by the sensitivity of instrumentation only  and there are no known natural limits to how brief or long a decay half life for radioactive decay of a radionuclide may be  The decay process  like all hindered energy transformations  may be analogized by a snowfield on a mountain  While friction between the ice crystals may be supporting the snow s weight  the system is inherently unstable with regard to a state of lower potential energy  A disturbance would thus facilitate the path to a state of greater entropy  The system will move towards the ground state  producing heat  and the total energy will be distributable over a larger number of quantum states  Thus  an avalanche results  The total energy does not change in this process  but  because of the law of entropy  avalanches happen only in one direction and that is toward the  ground state    the state with the largest number of ways in which the available energy could be distributed  Such a collapse  a decay event  requires a specific activation energy  For a snow avalanche  this energy comes as a disturbance from outside the system  although such disturbances can be arbitrarily small  In the case of an excited atomic nucleus  the arbitrarily small disturbance comes from quantum vacuum fluctuations  A radioactive nucleus  or any excited system in quantum mechanics  is unstable  and can  thus  spontaneously stabilize to a less excited system  The resulting transformation alters the structure of the nucleus and results in the emission of either a photon or a high velocity particle that has mass  such as an electron  alpha particle  or other type    edit  Discovery Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by the French scientist Henri Becquerel  while working on phosphorescent materials  These materials glow in the dark after exposure to light  and he suspected that the glow produced in cathode ray tubes by X rays might be associated with phosphorescence  He wrapped a photographic plate in black paper and placed various phosphorescent salts on it  All results were negative until he used uranium salts  The result with these compounds was a blackening of the plate  These radiations were called Becquerel Rays  Pierre and Marie Curie in their Paris laboratory  before 1907 It soon became clear that the blackening of the plate did not have anything to do with phosphorescence  because the plate blackened when the mineral was in the dark  Non phosphorescent salts of uranium and metallic uranium also blackened the plate  It was clear that there is a form of radiation that could pass through paper that was causing the plate to become black  At first it seemed that the new radiation was similar to the then recently discovered X rays  Further research by Becquerel  Ernest Rutherford  Paul Villard  Pierre Curie  Marie Curie  and others discovered that this form of radioactivity was significantly more complicated  Different types of decay can occur  producing very different types of radiation  Rutherford was the first to realize that they all occur with the same mathematical exponential formula  see below   and Rutherford and his student Frederick Soddy were first to realize that many decay processes resulted in the transmutation of one element to another  Subsequently  the radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy was formulated to describe the products of alpha and beta decay  The early researchers also discovered that many other chemical elements besides uranium have radioactive isotopes  A systematic search for the total radioactivity in uranium ores also guided Marie Curie to isolate a new element polonium and to separate a new element radium from barium  The two elements  chemical similarity would otherwise have made them difficult to distinguish   edit  Danger of radioactive substances Main article  Ionizing radiation The danger classification sign of radioactive materials Alpha particles may be completely stopped by a sheet of paper  beta particles by aluminum shielding  Gamma rays can only be reduced by much more substantial barriers  such as a very thick layer of lead  Different types of decay of a radionuclide  Vertical  atomic number Z  Horizontal  neutron number N The dangers of radioactivity and radiation were not immediately recognized  Acute effects of radiation were first observed in the use of X rays when electrical engineer and physicist Nikola Tesla intentionally subjected his fingers to X rays during 1896  5  He published his observations concerning the burns that developed  though he attributed them to ozone rather than to X rays  His injuries healed later  The genetic effects of radiation  including the effect on cancer risk  were recognized much later  During 1927  Hermann Joseph Muller published research showing genetic effects  and in 1946 was awarded the Nobel prize for his findings  Before the biological effects of radiation were known  many physicians and corporations had begun marketing radioactive substances as patent medicine  glow in the dark pigments  and radioactive quackery  Examples were radium enema treatments  and radium containing waters to be drunk as tonics  Marie Curie protested this sort of treatment  warning that the effects of radiation on the human body were not well understood  Curie later died from aplastic anemia  which was likely caused by exposure to ionizing radiation   By the 1930s  after a number of cases of bone necrosis and death in enthusiasts  radium containing medical products had been largely removed from the market   edit  Types of decay As for types of radioactive radiation  it was found that an electric or magnetic field could split such emissions into three types of beams  For lack of better terms  the rays were given the alphabetic names alpha  beta  and gamma  still in use today  While alpha decay was seen only in heavier elements  atomic number 52  tellurium  and greater   the other two types of decay were seen in all of the elements  In analyzing the nature of the decay products  it was obvious from the direction of electromagnetic forces produced upon the radiations by external magnetic and electric fields that alpha rays carried a positive charge  beta rays carried a negative charge  and gamma rays were neutral  From the magnitude of deflection  it was clear that alpha particles were much more massive than beta particles  Passing alpha particles through a very thin glass window and trapping them in a discharge tube allowed researchers to study the emission spectrum of the resulting gas  and ultimately prove that alpha particles are helium nuclei  Other experiments showed the similarity between classical beta radiation and cathode rays  They are both streams of electrons  Likewise gamma radiation and X rays were found to be similar high energy electromagnetic radiation  The relationship between types of decays also began to be examined  For example  gamma decay was almost always found associated with other types of decay  occurring at about the same time  or afterward  Gamma decay as a separate phenomenon  with its own half life  now termed isomeric transition   was found in natural radioactivity to be a result of the gamma decay of excited metastable nuclear isomers  in turn created from other types of decay  Although alpha  beta  and gamma were found most commonly  other types of decay were eventually discovered  Shortly after the discovery of the positron in cosmic ray products  it was realized that the same process that operates in classical beta decay can also produce positrons  positron emission   In an analogous process  instead of emitting positrons and neutrinos  some proton rich nuclides were found to capture their own atomic electrons  electron capture   and emit only a neutrino  and usually also a gamma ray   Each of these types of decay involves the capture or emission of nuclear electrons or positrons  and acts to move a nucleus toward the ratio of neutrons to protons that has the least energy for a given total number of nucleons  neutrons plus protons   Shortly after discovery of the neutron in 1932  it was discovered by Enrico Fermi that certain rare decay reactions yield neutrons as a decay particle  neutron emission   Isolated proton emission was eventually observed in some elements  It was also found that some heavy elements may undergo spontaneous fission into products that vary in composition  In a phenomenon called cluster decay  specific combinations of neutrons and protons  atomic nuclei  other than alpha particles  helium nuclei  were found to be spontaneously emitted from atoms  on occasion  Other types of radioactive decay that emit previously seen particles were found  but by different mechanisms  An example is internal conversion  which results in electron and sometimes high energy photon emission  even though it involves neither beta nor gamma decay  This type of decay  like isomeric transition gamma decay  did not transmute one element to another  Rare events that involve a combination of two beta decay type events happening simultaneously  see below  are known  Any decay process that does not violate conservation of energy or momentum laws  and perhaps other particle conservation laws  is permitted to happen  although not all have been detected  An interesting example  discussed in a final section  is bound state beta decay of rhenium 187  In this process  an inverse of electron capture  beta electron decay of the parent nuclide is not accompanied by beta electron emission  because the beta particle has been captured into the K shell of the emitting atom  An antineutrino  however  is emitted   edit  Decay modes in table form Radionuclides can undergo a number of different reactions  These are summarized in the following table  A nucleus with mass number A and atomic number Z is represented as  A  Z   The column  Daughter nucleus  indicates the difference between the new nucleus and the original nucleus  Thus   A   1  Z  means that the mass number is one less than before  but the atomic number is the same as before

electron neutrino  A  Z   1  Electron capture A nucleus captures an orbiting electron and emits a neutrino  the daughter nucleus is left in an excited unstable state  A  Z   1  Bound state beta decay A nucleus beta decays to electron and antineutrino  but the electron is not emitted  as it is captured into an empty K shell  the daughter nucleus is left in an excited and unstable state  This process is suppressed except in ionized atoms that have K shell vacancies   A  Z   1  Double beta decay A nucleus emits two electrons and two antineutrinos  A  Z   2  Double electron capture A nucleus absorbs two orbital electrons and emits two neutrinos   the daughter nucleus is left in an excited and unstable state  A  Z   2  Electron capture with positron emission A nucleus absorbs one orbital electron  emits one positron and two neutrinos  A  Z   2  Double positron emission A nucleus emits two positrons and two neutrinos  A  Z   2  Transitions between states of the same nucleus  Isomeric transition Excited nucleus releases a high energy photon  gamma ray   A  Z  Internal conversion Excited nucleus transfers energy to an orbital electron and it is ejected from the atom  A  Z  Radioactive decay results in a reduction of summed rest mass  once the released energy  the disintegration energy  has escaped in some way  for example  the products might be captured and cooled  and the heat allowed to escape   Although decay energy is sometimes defined as associated with the difference between the mass of the parent nuclide products and the mass of the decay products  this is true only of rest mass measurements  where some energy has been removed from the product system  This is true because the decay energy must always carry mass with it  wherever it appears  see mass in special relativity  according to the formula E   mc2  The decay energy is initially released as the energy of emitted photons plus the kinetic energy of massive emitted particles  that is  particles that have rest mass   If these particles come to thermal equilibrium with their surroundings and photons are absorbed  then the decay energy is transformed to thermal energy  which retains its mass  Decay energy therefore remains associated with a certain measure of mass of the decay system invariant mass  The energy of photons  kinetic energy of emitted particles  and  later  the thermal energy of the surrounding matter  all contribute to calculations of invariant mass of systems  Thus  while the sum of rest masses of particles is not conserved in radioactive decay  the system mass and system invariant mass  and also the system total energy  is conserved throughout any decay process   edit  Decay chains and multiple modes The daughter nuclide of a decay event may also be unstable  radioactive   In this case  it will also decay  producing radiation  The resulting second daughter nuclide may also be radioactive  This can lead to a sequence of several decay events  Eventually  a stable nuclide is produced  This is called a decay chain  see this article for specific details of important natural decay chains   Gamma ray energy spectrum of uranium ore  inset   Gamma rays are emitted by decaying nuclides  and the gamma ray energy can be used to characterize the decay  which nuclide is decaying to which   Here  using the gamma ray spectrum  several nuclides that are typical of the decay chain of 238U have been identified  226Ra  214Pb  214Bi  An example is the natural decay chain of 238U  which is as follows  decays  through alpha emission  with a half life of 4 5 billion years to thorium 234 which decays  through beta emission  with a half life of 24 days to protactinium 234 which decays  through beta emission  with a half life of 1 2 minutes to uranium 234 which decays  through alpha emission  with a half life of 240 thousand years to thorium 230 which decays  through alpha emission  with a half life of 77 thousand years to radium 226 which decays  through alpha emission  with a half life of 1 6 thousand years to radon 222 which decays  through alpha emission  with a half life of 3 8 days to polonium 218 which decays  through alpha emission  with a half life of 3 1 minutes to lead 214 which decays  through beta emission  with a half life of 27 minutes to bismuth 214 which decays  through beta emission  with a half life of 20 minutes to polonium 214 which decays  through alpha emission  with a half life of 160 microseconds to lead 210 which decays  through beta emission  with a half life of 22 years to bismuth 210 which decays  through beta emission  with a half life of 5 days to polonium 210 which decays  through alpha emission  with a half life of 140 days to lead 206  which is a stable nuclide  Some radionuclides may have several different paths of decay  For example  approximately 36  of bismuth 212 decays  through alpha emission  to thallium 208 while approximately 64  of bismuth 212 decays  through beta emission  to polonium 212  Both the thallium 208 and the polonium 212 are radioactive daughter products of bismuth 212  and both decay directly to stable lead 208   edit  Occurrence and applications According to the Big Bang theory  stable isotopes of the lightest five elements  H  He  and traces of Li  Be  and B  were produced very shortly after the emergence of the universe  in a process called Big Bang nucleosynthesis  These lightest stable nuclides  including deuterium  survive to today  but any radioactive isotopes of the light elements produced in the Big Bang  such as tritium  have long since decayed  Isotopes of elements heavier than boron were not produced at all in the Big Bang  and these first five elements do not have any long lived radioisotopes  Thus  all radioactive nuclei are  therefore  relatively young with respect to the birth of the universe  having formed later in various other types of nucleosynthesis in stars  in particular  supernovae   and also during ongoing interactions between stable isotopes and energetic particles  For example  carbon 14  a radioactive nuclide with a half life of only 5730 years  is constantly produced in Earth s upper atmosphere due to interactions between cosmic rays and nitrogen  Radioactive decay has been put to use in the technique of radioisotopic labeling  which is used to track the passage of a chemical substance through a complex system  such as a living organism   A sample of the substance is synthesized with a high concentration of unstable atoms  The presence of the substance in one or another part of the system is determined by detecting the locations of decay events  On the premise that radioactive decay is truly random  rather than merely chaotic   it has been used in hardware random number generators  Because the process is not thought to vary significantly in mechanism over time  it is also a valuable tool in estimating the absolute ages of certain materials  For geological materials  the radioisotopes and some of their decay products become trapped when a rock solidifies  and can then later be used  subject to many well known qualifications  to estimate the date of the solidification  These include checking the results of several simultaneous processes and their products against each other  within the same sample  In a similar fashion  and also subject to qualification  the rate of formation of carbon 14 in various eras  the date of formation of organic matter within a certain period related to the isotope s half life may be estimated  because the carbon 14 becomes trapped when the organic matter grows and incorporates the new carbon 14 from the air  Thereafter  the amount of carbon 14 in organic matter decreases according to decay processes that may also be independently cross checked by other means  such as checking the carbon 14 in individual tree rings  for example    edit  Radioactive decay rates The SI unit of radioactive activity is the becquerel  Bq   in honor of the scientist  One Bq is defined as one transformation  or decay  per second  Since sensible sizes of radioactive material contains many atoms  a Bq is a tiny measure of activity  amounts on the order of GBq  gigabecquerel  1 x 109 decays per second  or TBq  terabecquerel  1 x 1012 decays per second  are commonly used  Another unit of radioactivity is the curie  Ci  which was originally defined as the amount of radium emanation  radon 222  in equilibrium with one gram of pure radium  isotope Ra 226  At present it is equal  by definition  to the activity of any radionuclide decaying with a disintegration rate of 3 7   1010 Bq  The use of Ci is currently discouraged by the SI  The decay rate  or activity  of a radioactive substance are characterized by  Constant quantities  The half life   t1 2  is the time taken for the activity of a given amount of a radioactive substance to decay to half of its initial value  The mean lifetime       tau  the average lifetime of a radioactive particle before decay  The decay constant       lambda  the inverse of the mean lifetime  Although these are constants  they are associated with statistically random behavior of populations of atoms  In consequence predictions using these constants are less accurate for small number of atoms  In principle the reciprocal of any number greater than one   a half life  a third life  or even a  1  2  life   can be used in exactly the same way as half life  but the half life t1 2 is adopted as the standard time associated with exponential decay  Time variable quantities  Total activity   A  is number of decays per unit time of a radioactive sample  Number of particles   N  is the total number of particles in the sample  Specific activity   SA  number of decays per unit time per amount of substance of the sample at time set to zero  t   0    Amount of substance  can be the mass  volume or moles of the initial sample  These are related as follows  where N0 is the initial amount of active substance   substance that has the same percentage of unstable particles as when the substance was formed   edit  Activity measurements The units in which activities are measured are  becquerel  symbol Bq    one disintegration per second  curie  Ci    3 7   1010 Bq  Low activities are also measured in disintegrations per minute  dpm    edit  Mathematics of radioactive decay For the mathematical details of exponential decay in general context  see exponential decay  For related derivations with some further details  see half life  For the analogous mathematics in 1st order chemical reactions  see Consecutive reactions   edit  Universal law of radioactive decay Radioactivity is one very frequent example of exponential decay  The law describes the statistical behavior of a large number of nuclides  rather than individual ones  In the following formalism  the number of nuclides or nuclide population N  is of course a discrete variable  a natural number    but for any physical sample N is so large  amounts of L   1023 avagadro s constant  that it can be treated as a continuous variable  Differential calculus to set up differential equations for modelling the behaviour of the nuclear decay   edit  One decay process Consider the case of a nuclide A decaying into another B by some process A   B  emission of other particles  like electron neutrinos   e and electrons e  in beta decay  are irrelevant in what follows   The decay of an unstable nucleus is entirely random and it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay  1  However  it is equally likely to decay at any time  Therefore  given a sample of a particular radioisotope  the number of decay events  dN expected to occur in a small interval of time dt is proportional to the number of atoms present N  that is Particular radionuclides decay at different rates  so each has its own decay constant    The probability of decay  dN N is proportional to an increment of time  dt  The negative sign indicates that N decreases as time increases  as each decay event follows one after another  The solution to this first order differential equation is the function  where N0 is the value of N at time t   0  This equation is of particular interest  the behaviour of numerous important quantities can be found from it  see below   Although the parent decay distribution follows an exponential  observations of decay times will be limited by a finite integer number of N atoms and follow Poisson statistics as a consequence of the random nature of the process  We have for all time t  where Ntotal is the constant number of particles throughout the decay process  clearly equal to the initial number of A nuclides since this is the initial substance  If the number of non decayed A nuclei is  then the number of nuclei of B  i e  number of decayed A nuclei  is  edit  Chain decay processes Chain of two decays Now consider the case of a chain of two decays  one nuclide A decaying into another B by one process  then B decaying into another C by a second process  i e  A   B   C  The previous equation cannot be applied to a decay chain  but can be generalized as follows  The decay rate of B is proportional to the number of nuclides of B present  so again we have  but care must be taken  Since A decays into B  then B decays into C  the activity of A adds to the total number of B nuclides in the present sample  before those B nuclides decay and reduce the number of nuclides leading to the later sample  In other words  the number of second generation nuclei B increases as a result of the first generation nuclei decay of A  and decreases as a result of its own decay into the third generation nuclei C  6  The proportionality becomes an equation  adding the increasing  and correcting  term obtains the law for a decay chain for two nuclides  The equation is not since this implies the number of atoms of B is only decreasing as time increases  which is not the case  The rate of change of NB  that is dNB dt  is related to the changes in the amounts of A and B  NB can increase as B is produced from A and decrease as B produces C  Re writing using the previous results  The subscripts simply refer to the respective nuclides  i e  NA is the number of nuclides of type A  NA0 is the initial number of nuclides of type A   A is the decay constant for A   and similarly for nuclide B  Solving this equation for NB gives  Naturally this equation reduces to the previous solution  in the case B is a stable nuclide   B   0   as shown above for one decay  The solution can be found by the integration factor method  where the integrating factor is e Bt  This case is perhaps the most useful  since it can derive both the one decay equation  above  and the equation for multi decay chains  below  more directly  Chain of any number of decays For the general case of any number of consecutive decays in a decay chain  i e  A1   A2       Ai       AD  where D is the number of decays and i is a dummy index  i   1  2  3     D   each nuclide population can be found in terms of the previous population  using the above result in a recursive form  The general solution to the recursive problem are given by Bateman s equations 6    edit  Alternative decay modes In all of the above examples  the initial nuclide decays into only one product  Consider the case of one initial nuclide which can decay into two products  that is A   B   C  We have for all time t  in which  so the relations follow in parallel  indicating that the total decay constant is that of A  given by  Solving this equation for NA  When measuring the production of one nuclide  one can only observe the total decay constant  A  The decay constants  B and  C determine the probability for the decay to result in products B or C as follows  These perhaps seemingly disjionted results are consistent   edit  Corollaries of the decay laws The solutions to the above differential equations are sometimes written using quantities related to the number of nuclide particles N in a sample  where L is Avagadro s constant 6 023 1023  and Ar is the relative atomic mass number  and the amount of the substance is in moles  The activity  A    N  The amount of substance  n   N L  The mass  M   Arn   ArN L  Collecting these results together for convenience  N   A     Ln   LM Ar  Equivalent ways to write the decay solutions  then  are as follows  One decay processes The solution can be written  Notice how we can simply replace each quantity  on both sides of the equation   since they are directly proportional to N and so the constants cancel  constant at least for a particular nuclide   Chain decay processes For the two decay chain  its almost as simple   edit  Decay timing  definitions and relations  edit  Time constant and mean life For the one decay solution A   B  the equation indicates that the decay constant   has units of t 1  and can thus also be represented as 1    where   is a characteristic time of the process called the time constant  In a radioactive decay process  this time constant is also the mean lifetime for decaying atoms  Each atom  lives  for a finite amount of time before it decays  and it may be shown that this mean lifetime is the arithmetic mean of all the atoms  lifetimes  and that it is    which again is related to the decay constant as follows  This form is also true for two decay processes simultaneously A   B   C  inserting the equivalent values of decay constants  as given above  into the decay solution leads to  Simulation of many identical atoms undergoing radioactive decay  starting with either 4 atoms  left  or 400  right   The number at the top indicates how many half lives have elapsed  Note the law of large numbers  with more atoms  the overall decay is less random   edit  Half life A more commonly used parameter is the half life  Given a sample of a particular radionuclide  the half life is the time taken for half the radionuclide s atoms to decay  For the case of one decay nuclear reactions  the half life is related to the decay constant as follows  set N   N0 2 and t   T1 2 to obtain This relationship between the half life and the decay constant shows that highly radioactive substances are quickly spent  while those that radiate weakly endure longer  Half lives of known radionuclides vary widely  from more than 1019 years  such as for the very nearly stable nuclide 209Bi  to 10 23 seconds for highly unstable ones  The factor of ln 2  in the above relations results from the fact that concept of  half life  is merely a way of selecting a different base other than the natural base e for the lifetime expression  The time constant   is the e  1  life  the time until only 1 e remains  about 36 8   rather than the 50  in the half life of a radionuclide  Thus    is longer than t1 2  The following equation can be shown to be valid  Since radioactive decay is exponential with a constant probability  each process could as easily be described with a different constant time period that  for example  gave its   1 3  life   how long until only 1 3 is left  or   1 10  life   a time period until only 10  is left   and so on  Thus  the choice of   and t1 2 for marker times  are only for convenience  and from convention  They reflect a fundamental principle only in so much as they show that the same proportion of a given radioactive substance will decay  during any time period that one chooses  Mathematically  the nth life for the above situation would be found in the same way as above   by setting N   N0 n  and substituting into the decay solution to obtain  edit  Example A sample of 14C  whose half life is 5730 years  has a decay rate of 14 disintegration per minute  dpm  per gram of natural carbon  An artefact is found to have radioactivity of 4 dpm per gram of its present C  how old is the artefact  Using the above equation  we have  where  years  years   edit  Changing decay rates The radioactive decay modes of electron capture and internal conversion are known to be slightly sensitive to chemical and environmental effects which change the electronic structure of the atom  which in turn affects the presence of 1s and 2s electrons that participate in the decay process  A small number of mostly light nuclides are affected  For example  chemical bonds can affect the rate of electron capture to a small degree  in general  less than 1   depending on the proximity of electrons to the nucleus in beryllium  In 7Be  a difference of 0 9  has been observed between half lives in metallic and insulating environments  7  This relatively large effect is because beryllium is a small atom whose valence electrons are in 2s atomic orbitals  which are subject to electron capture in 7Be because  like all s atomic orbitals in all atoms  they naturally penetrate into the nucleus  Rhenium 187 is a more spectacular example  187Re normally beta decays to 187Os with a half life of 41 6   109 y  8  but studies using fully ionised 187Re atoms  bare nuclei  have found that this can decrease to only 33 y  This is attributed to  bound state    decay  of the fully ionised atom   the electron is emitted into the  K shell   1s atomic orbital   which cannot occur for neutral atoms in which all low lying bound states are occupied  9  A number of experiments have found that decay rates of other modes of artificial and naturally occurring radioisotopes are  to a high degree of precision  unaffected by external conditions such as temperature  pressure  the chemical environment  and electric  magnetic  or gravitational fields  citation needed  Comparison of laboratory experiments over the last century  studies of the Oklo natural nuclear reactor  which exemplified the effects of thermal neutrons on nuclear decay   and astrophysical observations of the luminosity decays of distant supernovae  which occurred far away so the light has taken a great deal of time to reach us   for example  strongly indicate that decay rates have been constant  at least to within the limitations of small experimental errors  as a function of time as well  Recent results suggest the possibility that decay rates might have a weak dependence  0 5  or less  on environmental factors  It has been suggested that measurements of decay rates of silicon 32  manganese 54  and radium 226 exhibit small seasonal variations  of the order of 0 1    proposed to be related to either solar flare activity or distance from the sun  10  11  12  However  such measurements are highly susceptible to systematic errors  and a subsequent paper 13  has found no evidence for such correlations in six other isotopes  and sets upper limits on the size of any such effects   edit  See also Actinides in the environment Background radiation Chernobyl disaster Decay chain Fallout shelter Half life Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents
