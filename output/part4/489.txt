central South America  It is bordered by Brazil to the north and east  Paraguay and Argentina to the south  Chile to the southwest  and Peru to the west  Prior to European colonization  the Andean region of Bolivia was a part of the Inca Empire   the largest state in Pre Columbian America  The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century  During most of the Spanish colonial period  this territory was called Upper Peru and was under the administration of the Viceroyalty of Peru  which included most of Spain s South American colonies  After declaring independence in 1809  16 years of war followed before the establishment of the Republic  named for Sim n Bol var  on 6 August 1825  Bolivia has struggled through periods of political instability  dictatorships and economic woes  Bolivia is a democratic republic that is divided into nine departments  Its geography is varied from the peaks of the Andes in the West  to the Eastern Lowlands  situated within the Amazon Basin  It is a developing country  with a Medium Human Development Index score  and a poverty level of 53   14  Its main economic activities include agriculture  forestry  fishing  mining  and manufacturing goods such as textiles  clothing  refined metals  and refined petroleum  Bolivia is very wealthy in minerals  especially tin  The Bolivian population  estimated at 10 million  is multiethnic  including Amerindians  Mestizos  Europeans  and Africans  The main language spoken is Spanish  although the Aymara and Quechua languages are also common and all three  as well as 34 other indigenous languages  are official  The large number of different cultures within Bolivia has contributed greatly to a wide diversity in fields such as art  cuisine  literature  and music  Contents 1 Etymology 2

leader in the Spanish American wars of independence  15 Antonio Jos  de Sucre had been given the option by Bol var to either keep Upper Peru  present day Bolivia  under the newly formed Republic of Peru  to unite with the United Provinces of Rio de la Plata  or to formally declare its independence from the Viceroyalty of Peru that had dominated most of the region  Sucre opted to create a new nation and  with local support  named it in honor of Sim n Bol var  16  However  the original name given to the newly formed country was Republic of Bol var  The name would not change to Bolivia until some days later when congressman Manuel Mart n Cruz proposed   If from Romulus comes Rome  then from Bol var comes Bolivia   Spanish  Si de R mulo Roma  de Bol var Bolivia   The name stuck and was approved by the Republic on 3 October 1825  17  In 2009  a new constitution changed the country s name from the  Republic of Bolivia  to the  Plurinational State of Bolivia  in recognition of the multi ethnic nature of the country and the enhanced position of Bolivia s indigenous peoples under the new constitution  18  19  20   edit  History Main article  History of Bolivia Tiwanaku at its largest territorial extent  AD 950 The region that is now known as Bolivia has been occupied for over 2 000 years  when the Aymara arrived in the region  Present day Aymara associate themselves with an advanced civilization situated at Tiwanaku  in Western Bolivia  The capital city of Tiwanaku dates from as early as 1500 BC when it was a small agriculturally based village  21  The community grew to urban proportions between AD 600 and AD 800  becoming an important regional power in the southern Andes  According to early estimates  at its maximum extent  the city covered approximately 6 5 square kilometers  and had between 15 000   30 000 inhabitants  22  However  satellite imaging was used recently to map the extent of fossilized suka kollus across the three primary valleys of Tiwanaku  arriving at population carrying capacity estimates of anywhere between 285 000 and 1 482 000 people  23  Around AD 400  Tiwanaku went from being a locally dominant force to a predatory state  Tiwanaku expanded its reaches into the Yungas and brought its culture and way of life to many other cultures in Peru  Bolivia  and Chile  However  Tiwanaku was not a violent culture in many respects  In order to expand its reach  Tiwanaku exercised great political astuteness  creating colonies  fostering trade agreements  which made the other cultures rather dependent   and instituting state cults  24  The empire continued to grow with no end in sight  William H  Isbell states that  Tiahuanaco underwent a dramatic transformation between AD 600 and 700 that established new monumental standards for civic architecture and greatly increased the resident population   25  Tiwanaku continued to absorb cultures rather than eradicate them  Archaeologists note a dramatic adoption of Tiwanaku ceramics into the cultures which became part of the Tiwanaku empire  Tiwanaku s power was further solidified through the trade it implemented among the cities within its empire  24  Tiwanaku s elites gained their status through the surplus food they controlled  collected from outlying regions and then redistributed to the general populace  Further  this elite s control of llama herds became a powerful control mechanism as llamas were essential for carrying goods between the civic centre and the periphery  These herds also came to symbolize class distinctions between the commoners and the elites  Through this control and manipulation of surplus resources  the elite s power continued to grow until about AD 950  At this time a dramatic shift in climate occurred  26  There occurred a significant drop in precipitation in the Titicaca Basin  Some archaeologists venture to label this a major drought  As the rainfall decreased  many of the cities further away from Lake Titicaca began to tender less foodstuffs to the elites  As the surplus of food decreased  and thus the amount available to underpin their power  the control of the elites began to falter  The capital city became the last place viable place for food production due to the resiliency of the raised field method of agriculture  But  in the end  even this more productive design for food production was no match for the vagaries of the weather  Tiwanaku disappeared around AD 1000 because food production  the main source of the power elite s control  dried up  The area remained uninhabited for centuries thereafter  26  Inca Expansion  1438 1527  Between 1438 and 1527  the Inca empire  during its last great expansion  gained control over much of what is now western Bolivia  The Incas would not maintain control of the region for long however  as the rapidly expanding Inca Empire was internally weak  As such  the impending Spanish conquest would be remarkably easy   edit  Colonial period The Spanish conquest of the Inca empire began in 1524  and was mostly completed by 1533  The territory now called Bolivia was known as  Upper Peru   and was under the authority of the Viceroy of Lima  Local government came from the Audiencia de Charcas located in Chuquisaca  La Plata modern Sucre   Founded in 1545 as a mining town  Potos  soon produced fabulous wealth  becoming the largest city in the New World with a population exceeding 150 000 people  27  By the late 16th century Bolivian silver was an important source of revenue for the Spanish Empire  28  A steady stream of natives served as labor force  the Spanish employed the pre Columbian draft system called the mita   29  Upper Peru was bounded to Viceroyalty of the R o de la Plata in 1776  T pac Katari led the indigenous rebellion that laid siege to La Paz in March 1781  during which 20 000 people died  30  As Spanish royal authority weakened during the Napoleonic wars  sentiment against colonial rule grew   edit  Independence and subsequent wars The struggle for independence started in the city of Sucre in 1809  with the Chuquisaca Revolution  Chuquisaca was then the name of the city   That revolution  which created a local government Junta  was followed by the La Paz revolution  during which Bolivia actually declared independence  Both revolutions were short lived  and defeated by the Spanish authorities  but the following year the Spanish American wars of independence raged across the continent  Bolivia was captured and recaptured many times during the war by the royalists and patriots  Buenos Aires sent three military campaigns  all of which were defeated  and eventually limited itself to protecting the national borders at Salta  Bolivia was finally freed of Royalist dominion by Antonio Jos  de Sucre  with a military campaign coming from the North in support of the campaign of Sim n Bol var  After 16 years of war the Republic was proclaimed on 6 August 1825 and named Bolivia in honor of Bol var  In 1836  Bolivia  under the rule of Marshal Andr s de Santa Cruz  invaded Peru to reinstall the deposed president  General Luis Jos  de Orbegoso  Peru and Bolivia formed the Peru Bolivian Confederation  with de Santa Cruz as the Supreme Protector  Following tension between the Confederation and Chile  Chile declared war on 28 December 1836  Argentina  Chile s ally  declared war on the Confederation on 9 May 1837  The Peruvian Bolivian forces achieved several major victories during the War of the Confederation  the defeat of the Argentine expedition and the defeat of the first Chilean expedition on the fields of Paucarpata near the city of Arequipa  On the same field  the Chilean and Peruvian rebel army surrendered unconditionally and signed the Paucarpata Treaty  The treaty stipulated that Chile would withdraw from Peru Bolivia  Chile would return captured Confederate ships  economic relations would be normalized  and the Confederation would pay Peruvian debt to Chile  In Chile  public outrage over the treaty forced the government to reject it  Chile organized a second attack on the Confederation and defeated it in the Battle of Yungay  After this defeat  Santa Cruz resigned and went to exile in Ecuador and then Paris  and the Peruvian Bolivian Confederation was dissolved  Following the independence of Peru  Peruvian president General Agust n Gamarra invaded Bolivia  The Peruvian army was decisively defeated at the Battle of Ingavi on 20 November 1841 where Gamarra was killed  The Bolivian army under General Jos  Ballivi n then mounted a counter offensive  capturing the Peruvian port of Arica  Later  both sides signed a peace treaty in 1842  putting a final end to the war   edit  Economic instability and continued wars A period of political and economic instability in the early to mid 19th century weakened Bolivia  Then in the War of the Pacific  1879 83  against Chile  it lost its access to the sea and the adjoining rich salitre  saltpeter  fields  together with the port of Antofagasta  Since independence  Bolivia has lost over half of its territory to neighboring countries in wars  citation needed  It also lost the state of Acre  in the Acre War  important because this region was known for its production of rubber  Peasants and the Bolivian army fought briefly but after a few victories  and facing the prospect of a total war against Brazil  it was forced to sign the Treaty of Petr polis in 1903  in which Bolivia lost this rich territory  Popular myth has it that Bolivian president Mariano Melgarejo  1864 71  traded the land for what he called  a magnificent white horse  and Acre was subsequently flooded by Brazilians which ultimately led to confrontation and fear of war with Brazil  In the late 19th century  an increase in the world price of gold brought Bolivia relative prosperity and political stability  During the early 20th century  tin replaced gold as the country s most important source of wealth  A succession of governments controlled by the economic and social elite followed laissez faire capitalist policies through the first thirty years of the 20th century  31  Living conditions of the native people  who constitute most of the population  remained deplorable  With work opportunities limited to primitive conditions in the mines and in large estates having nearly feudal status  they had no access to education  economic opportunity  and political participation  Bolivia s defeat by Paraguay in the Chaco War  1932 35   where Bolivia lost a great part of the Gran Chaco region in dispute  marked a turning point  32  33  34   edit  Nationalist Revolutionary Movement A llama in the Laguna Colorada  a shallow salt lake in the southwestern Bolivian sector of the Altiplano  The Revolutionary Nationalist Movement  MNR  emerged as a broadly based party  Denied its victory in the 1951 presidential elections  the MNR led a successful revolution in 1952  Under President V ctor Paz Estenssoro  the MNR  having strong popular pressure  introduced universal suffrage into his political platform and carried out a sweeping land reform promoting rural education and nationalization of the country s largest tin mines  12 years of tumultuous rule left the MNR divided  In 1964  a military junta overthrew President Estenssoro at the outset of his third term  The 1969 death of President Ren  Barrientos Ortu o  a former member of the junta who was elected president in 1966  led to a succession of weak governments  Alarmed by the rising Popular Assembly and the increase in the popularity of President Juan Jos  Torres  the military  the MNR  and others installed Colonel  later General  Hugo Banzer Su rez as president in 1971  Banzer ruled with MNR support from 1971 to 1974  Then  impatient with schisms in the coalition  he replaced civilians with members of the armed forces and suspended political activities  The economy grew impressively during most of Banzer s presidency  but human rights violations and eventual fiscal crises undercut his support  He was forced to call elections in 1978  and Bolivia again entered a period of political turmoil   edit  CIA activities and leftist insurgency Further information  CIA activities in Bolivia and  ancahuaz  Guerrilla The CIA had been active in providing finances and training to the Bolivian military in 1960s  The revolutionary leader Che Guevara was killed by a team of CIA officers and members of the Bolivian Army on 9 October 1967  in Bolivia  The CIA reported that Guevara was captured on 8 October as a result of the clash with the Cuban led guerrillas  He had a wound in his leg  but was otherwise in fair condition  At 1150 hours on 9 October the Second Ranger Battalion received direct orders from Bolivian Army Headquarters in La Paz to kill Guevara  These orders were carried out at 1315 hours the same day with a burst of fire from an M 2 automatic rifle  F lix Rodr guez was a CIA officer on the team with the Bolivian Army that captured and shot Guevara  35  Rodriguez said that after he received a Bolivian presidential execution order  he told  the soldier who pulled the trigger to aim carefully  to remain consistent with the Bolivian government s story that Che had been killed in action during a clash with the Bolivian army   Rodriguez said the US government had wanted Che in Panama  and  I could have tried to falsify the command to the troops  and got Che to Panama as the US government said they had wanted   said Mr Rodriguez  but he chose to  let history run its course  as desired by Bolivia   36   edit  Military governments  Garc a Meza and Siles Zuazo Elections in 1979 and 1981 were inconclusive and marked by fraud  There were coups d  tat  counter coups  and caretaker governments  In 1980  General Luis Garc a Meza Tejada carried out a ruthless and violent coup d  tat that did not have popular support  He pacified the people by promising to remain in power only for one year   At the end of the year  he staged a televised rally to claim popular support and announced   Bueno  me quedo   or   All right  I ll stay  in office    37  He was deposed shortly thereafter   His government was notorious for human rights abuses  drug trafficking  and economic mismanagement  during his presidency  the inflation that later crippled the Bolivian economy could already be felt  Later convicted in absentia for various crimes by attorney Juan del Granado  including murder  Garc a Meza was extradited from Brazil and began serving a 30 year prison sentence in 1995  After a military rebellion forced out Meza in 1981  three other military governments in 14 months struggled with Bolivia s growing problems  Unrest forced the military to convoke the Congress elected in 1980 and allow it to choose a new chief executive  In October 1982  Hern n Siles Zuazo again became president  22 years after the end of his first term of office  1956 60    edit  S nchez de Lozada and Banzer  Liberalizing the economy Gonzalo S nchez de Lozada pursued an aggressive economic and social reform agenda  The most dramatic reform was the  capitalization  program  under which investors  typically foreign  acquired 50  ownership and management control of public enterprises  such as the state petroleum corporation  telecommunications system  airlines  railroads  and electric utilities  in return for agreed upon capital investments  Gonzalo S nchez de Lozada The reforms and economic restructuring were strongly opposed by certain segments of society  which instigated frequent and sometimes violent protests  particularly in La Paz and the Chapare coca growing region  from 1994 through 1996  The de Lozada government pursued a policy of offering monetary compensation for voluntary eradication of illegal coca by its growers in the Chapare region  The policy produced little net reduction in coca  and in the mid 1990s Bolivia accounted for about one third of the world s coca that was being processed into cocaine  The coca leaf has long been part of the Bolivian culture  as indigenous workers have traditionally used the leaf for its properties as a mild stimulant and appetite suppressant  During this time  the umbrella labor organization of Bolivia  the Central Obrera Boliviana  COB   became increasingly unable to effectively challenge government policy  A teachers  strike in 1995 was defeated because the COB could not marshal the support of many of its members  including construction and factory workers  The state also used selective martial law to keep the disruptions caused by the teachers to a minimum  The teachers were led by Trotskyites  and were considered to be the most militant union in the COB  Their downfall was a major blow to the COB  which also became mired in internal corruption and infighting in 1996  In the 1997 elections  General Hugo Banzer  leader of the Nationalist Democratic Action party  ADN  and former dictator  1971 78   won 22  of the vote  while the MNR candidate won 18   General Banzer formed a coalition of the ADN  MIR  UCS  and CONDEPA parties  which held a majority of seats in the Bolivian Congress  The Congress elected him as president  and he was inaugurated on 6 August 1997  During the election campaign  Banzer had promised to suspend the privatization of the state owned oil company  YPFB  But this seemed unlikely to happen  considering Bolivia s weak position globally  The Banzer government basically continued the free market and privatization policies of its predecessor  The relatively robust economic growth of the mid 1990s continued until about the third year of its term in office  After that  regional  global and domestic factors contributed to a decline in economic growth  Financial crises in Argentina and Brazil  lower world prices for export commodities  and reduced employment in the coca sector depressed the Bolivian economy  The public also perceived a significant amount of public sector corruption  These factors contributed to increasing social protests during the second half of Banzer s term  38  At the outset of his government  President Banzer launched a policy of using special police units to physically eradicate the illegal coca of the Chapare region  The policy produced a sudden and dramatic four year decline in Bolivia s illegal coca crop  to the point that Bolivia became a relatively small supplier of coca for cocaine  Those left unemployed by coca eradication streamed into the cities  especially El Alto  the slum neighborhood of La Paz  The MIR of Jaime Paz Zamora remained a coalition partner throughout the Banzer government  supporting this policy  called the Dignity Plan   39  Between January 1999 and April 2000  large scale protests erupted in Cochabamba  Bolivia s third largest city  in response to the privatization of water resources by foreign companies and a subsequent doubling of water prices  On 6 August 2001  Banzer resigned from office after being diagnosed with cancer  He died less than a year later  Vice President Jorge Fernando Quiroga Ram rez completed the final year of his term  In the June 2002 national elections  former President Gonzalo S nchez de Lozada  MNR  placed first with 22 5  of the vote  followed by coca advocate and native peasant leader Evo Morales  Movement Toward Socialism  MAS  with 20 9   Morales edged out populist candidate Manfred Reyes Villa of the New Republican Force  NFR  by just 700 votes nationwide  earning a spot in the congressional run off against S nchez de Lozada on 4 August 2002  A July agreement between the MNR and the fourth place MIR  which had again been led in the election by former President Jaime Paz Zamora  virtually ensured the election of S nchez de Lozada in the congressional run off  and on 6 August he was sworn in for the second time  The MNR platform featured three overarching objectives  economic reactivation  and job creation   anti corruption  and social inclusion  La Paz skyline  The city is the highest capital in the world  In 2003 the Bolivian gas conflict broke out  On 12 October 2003 the government imposed martial law in El Alto after 16 people were shot by the police and several dozen wounded in violent clashes which erupted when a caravan of oil trucks escorted by police and soldiers deploying tanks and heavy caliber machine guns tried to breach a barricade  On 17 October 2003 Evo Morales  supporters from Cochabamba tried to march into Santa Cruz de la Sierra  the largest city of the eastern lowlands where support was strong for the president  They were turned back  Faced with the option of resigning or more bloodshed  Sanchez de Lozada offered his resignation in a letter to an emergency session of Congress  After his resignation was accepted and his vice president  Carlos Mesa  invested  he left on a commercially scheduled flight for the United States  In March 2004  the new president Carlos Mesa announced that his government would hold a series of rallies around the country  and at its embassies abroad  demanding that Chile return to Bolivia a stretch of seacoast that the country lost in 1884 after the end of the War of the Pacific  Chile has traditionally refused to negotiate on the issue  but Mesa nonetheless made this policy a central point of his administration  However  the country s internal situation became unfavorable for such political action on the international stage  After a resurgence of gas protests in 2005  Carlos Mesa attempted to resign in January 2005  but his offer was refused by Congress  On 22 March 2005  after weeks of new street protests from organizations accusing Mesa of bowing to U S  corporate interests  Mesa again offered his resignation to Congress  which was accepted on 10 June  The chief justice of the Supreme Court  Eduardo Rodr guez  was sworn as interim president to succeed the outgoing Carlos Mesa   edit  Plan de Todos Mobilizing against neoliberalism as a common enemy of the people  the indigenous population of the Andean region was able to achieve widespread government reform  40  Bolivia  in particular  was quite successful due to the prominence of an indigenous population and the persistence of reformist policies  In 1993  Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada ran for president in alliance with the Tupac Katari Revolutionary Liberation Movement  which inspired indigenous sensitive and multicultural aware policies  41  Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada  colloquially known as Goni  was able to shift Bolivian society by selling state firms and constitutionally acknowledging the existence of a multicultural and multiethnic population  Current development has led to a neoliberal citizenship regime in which civil rights are expressed through private property ownership  formal democracy and representation  and an investment in the maintaining of infrastructure  In the 1990s  Bolivia introduced  the Plan de Todos  which led to the decentralization of government  introduction of intercultural bilingual education  implementation of agrarian legislation  and privatization of state owned businesses  The Plan de Todos main incentive was to encourage popular participation among the Bolivian people  The law recognizes the existence of barrios and rural communities as Territorially Based Organizations  TBOs  and has oversight boards known as r miles de agilancia  or vigilance committees  that are responsible for overseeing municipal governments and planning projects  The Plan formally acknowledged the existence of 311 municipalities  which benefited directly based on the size of their populations  The Plan de Todos inspired the development of a market democracy with minimally regulated capitalist economy  The Plan explicitly stated that Bolivian citizens would own a minimum of 51  of enterprises  under the Plan  most state owned enterprises  SOEs   besides mines  were sold  42  This privatization of SOEs led to innovative neoliberal structuring that acknowledged a diverse population within Bolivia  43  The Law of Popular Participation 44  gave municipalities the responsibility of maintaining various infrastructures  and offering services   health  education  systems of irrigation  which stripped the responsibility away from the state  The state provides municipalities with twenty percent of federal tax revenue so that each municipality can adequately maintain these infrastructures  The Law also redistributes political power to the local level   edit  The Plurinational State of Bolivia Main article  Presidency of Evo Morales Evo Morales  inauguration as President The two main candidates for the 2005 Bolivian presidential election held on 18 December 2005 were Juan Evo Morales Ayma of the MAS Party and Jorge Quiroga  leader of the Social and Democratic Power  PODEMOS  Party and former head of the Acci n Democr tica Nacionalista  ADN  Party  Morales won the election with 53 7  of the votes  an absolute majority  unusual in Bolivian elections  He was sworn in on 22 January 2006  for a five year term  Prior to his official inauguration in La Paz  he was inaugurated in an Aymara ritual at the archeological site of Tiwanaku before a crowd of thousands of Aymara people and representatives of leftist movements from across Latin America  Though highly symbolic  this ritual was not historically based and primarily represented native Aymaras   not the main Quechua speaking population  Since the Spanish conquest in the early 16th century  this region of South America  where there is a majority native population  has been ruled mostly by descendants of European immigrants  On 1 May 2006  Morales caused controversy when he announced his intent to re nationalize Bolivian hydrocarbon assets  While stating that the initiative would not be an expropriation  Morales sent Bolivian troops to occupy 56 gas installations simultaneously  including the two Petrobras owned refineries which provide over 90  of Bolivia s refining capacity  All foreign energy firms were required to sign new contracts within 180 days giving Bolivia majority ownership  and up to 82  of revenues for the largest natural gas fields  All such firms signed contracts  Reports from the Bolivian government and the companies involved are contradictory as to plans for future investment  citation needed  By far the biggest customer for Bolivian hydrocarbons has been Brazil  which imports two thirds of Bolivia s natural gas via pipelines operated by the semi private Petrobras  Since gas can only be exported from landlocked Bolivia via Petrobras  large  and expensive  pipelines  the supplier and customer are strongly linked  Petrobras has announced plans to produce enough natural gas by 2011 to replace that now supplied by Bolivia  Bolivia s position is strengthened by the knowledge that hydrocarbon reserves are more highly valued now than at the times of previous nationalizations  and by the pledged support of fellow leftist  President Hugo Ch vez of Venezuela  Fulfilling a campaign promise  Morales opened on 6 August 2006  the Bolivian Constituent Assembly to begin writing a new constitution aimed at giving more power to the indigenous majority  45  Problems immediately arose when  unable to garner the two thirds majority needed to include controversial provisions in the constitutional draft  Morales  party announced that only a simple majority would be needed to draft individual articles while two thirds majority would be needed to pass the document in full  Violent protests arose in December 2006 in parts of the country for both two thirds and departmental autonomy  mostly in the eastern third of the country  where much of the hydrocarbon wealth is located  MAS and its supports believed two thirds voting rules would give an effective veto for all constitutional changes to the conservative minority  In August 2007  more conflicts arose in Sucre  as the city demanded the discussion of the seat of government inside the assembly  hoping the executive and legislative branches could return to the city  but assembly and the government said this demand was overwhelmingly impractical and politically undesirable  The conflict turned into violence  and the assembly was moved to a military area in Oruro  Although the main opposition party boycotted the session  a constitutional draft was approved on 24 November  In May 2008  Evo Morales was a signatory to the UNASUR Constitutive Treaty of the Union of South American Nations  Bolivia has ratified the treaty  In the 2009 national general elections  Evo Morales was re elected with 64 22  of the vote  His party  Movement for Socialism  also won a two thirds majority in both houses of the National Congress   edit  Administrative divisions Main articles  Departments of Bolivia  Provinces of Bolivia  Municipalities of Bolivia  Cantons of Bolivia  and Native Community Lands Bolivia is

Bolivia has historically maintained  as a state policy  a maritime claim to Chile  the claim asks for sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean and its maritime space  The Political Constitution of 2009 established that Bolivia declares its right to access to the sea  and that its objective is to solve the problem peacefully  Since the foundation of the United Nations in 1945  Bolivia has requested the General Assembly to consider its petition for sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean  The issue has also been presented before the Organization of American States  in 1979  the OAS passed the 426 Resolution  49  which declared that the Bolivian problem is a hemispheric problem  Chile has tried to assist in the matter  but without yielding any of its sovereign territory  Access to the Pacific Ocean by Chile  On April 4  1884  a truce was signed with Chile  whereby Chile gave facilities of access to Bolivian products through Antofagasta  and freed the payment of export rights in the port of Arica  In October 1904  the Treaty of Peace and Friendship was signed  and Chile agreed to build a railway between Arica and La Paz  to improve access of Bolivian products to the ports  Access to the

and also the largest lake in South America  53  54  shared with Peru  Also in this region is the Altiplano and the Salar de Uyuni  which is the largest salt flat of the world and an important source of lithium  Sub Andean region  in the center and south  an intermediate region between the Altiplano and the eastern llanos  it comprises 13  of the territory  extending over 142 815 km   It encompasses the Bolivian valleys and the Yungas region  It is distinguished by its farming activities and its temperate climate  Llanos region  in the northeast  it comprises 59  of the territory with 648 163 km   It is located to the north of the Cordillera Central  it extends from the Andean foothills to the Paraguay River  It is a region of flatland and small plateaus  all covered by extensive rainforests with enormous biodiversity  The region is located below 400 meters above sea level   edit  Hydrography Bolivia has three drainage basins that flow into the Atlantic Ocean or the Pacific Ocean  Amazon Basin  also called the North Basin  724 000 km    66  of the territory   The rivers of this basin generally have big meanders  thereby forming lakes such as the Murillo Lake in Pando Department  The main Bolivian tributary to the Amazon basin is the Mamor  River  with a length of 2000 km running north to the confluence with the Beni River  1 113 km of length and the second most important river of the country  The Beni River  along with the Madeira River  forms the main tributary of the Amazon River  From east to west  the basin is formed by other important rivers such as the Madre de Dios River  Orthon River  Abuna River  Yata River and the Guapor  River  The most important lakes are the Rogaguado Lake and the Rogagua Lake  Rio de la Plata Basin  also called the South Basin  229 500 km    21  of the territory   The tributaries are in general less abundant than the ones forming the Amazon basin  It is mainly formed by the Paraguay River  Pilcomayo River and Bermejo River  The most important lakes are the Uberaba Lake and the Mandior  Lake  both located in the Bolivian marshland  The Central Basin  which is an endorrheic basin  145 081 km    13  of the territory   The Altiplano has large amounts of lakes and rivers that do not run into any ocean  as they are enclosed by the Andean mountains  The most important river is the Desaguadero River  with a length of 436 km  the longest river of the Altiplano  it begins in Lake Titicaca and then runs in a southeast direction to the Poop  Lake  The basin is then formed by the Lake Titicaca  Lake Poop   the

ecosystems  Bolivia s variable altitudes  ranging from 90 to 6 542 meters above sea level  allow for a vast biologic diversity  The territory of Bolivia comprises 4 types of biomes  32 ecological regions  and 199 ecosystems  Within this geographic area there are several natural parks and reserves  such as the Noel Kempff Mercado National Park  the Madidi National Park  the Tunari National Park  the Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve  and the Kaa Iya del Gran Chaco National Park and Integrated Management Natural Area  among others  The biodiversity of species may be divided into

Bolivia Cochabamba  edit  Economy Main article  Economy of Bolivia Bolivia is one of the poorest and least developed countries in Latin America  despite being rich in natural resources  Bolivia s 2002 gross domestic product  GDP  totaled USD  7 9 billion  Economic growth was about 2 5  per year  and inflation was between 3  and 4  in 2002  it was under 2  in 2001   Bolivia was rated  Repressed  by the 2010 Index of Economic Freedom  59  However  despite a series of mostly political setbacks  between 2006 and 2009 the Morales administration has spurred growth higher than at any point in the preceding 30 years  The growth was accompanied by a moderate decrease in inequality  60  Bolivia s current economic situation remains lackluster  a factor that can be linked to several factors from the past three decades  The first major blow to the Bolivian economy came with a dramatic fall in the price of tin during the early 1980s  which impacted one of Bolivia s main sources of income and one of its major mining industries  61  The second major economic blow came at the end of the Cold War in the late 1980s and early 1990s as economic aid was withdrawn by western countries who had previously tried to keep a market liberal regime in power through financial support  Since 1985  the government of Bolivia has implemented a far reaching program of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform aimed at maintaining price stability  creating conditions for sustained growth  and alleviating scarcity  A major reform of the customs service in recent years has significantly improved transparency in this area  Parallel legislative reforms have locked into place market liberal policies  especially in the hydrocarbon and telecommunication sectors  that have encouraged private investment  Foreign investors are accorded national treatment  and foreign ownership of companies enjoys virtually no restrictions in Bolivia  62  Bolivia has the second largest natural gas reserves in South America  63  The government has a long term sales agreement to sell natural gas to Brazil through 2019  The government held a binding referendum in 2005 on the Hydrocarbon Law  The US Geological Service estimates that Bolivia has 5 4 million cubic tonnes of lithium which represents 50  70  of world reserves  The light metal is used to make high capacity batteries used in electric cars and such  The spinoff effect of lithium mining could cause Bolivia to become the  Saudi Arabia of the Green World   However  to mine for it would involve disturbing the country s salt flats  called Salar de Uyuni   an important natural feature which boosts tourism in the region  The government does not want to destroy this unique natural landscape  to meet the rising world demand for lithium  64  Uro person on floating an islet in Titicaca  In April 2000  Hugo Banzer  the former President of Bolivia  signed a contract with Aguas del Tunari  a private consortium  to operate and improve the water supply in Bolivia s third largest city  Cochabamba  Shortly thereafter  the company tripled the water rates in that city  an action which resulted in protests and rioting among those who could no longer afford clean water  65  66  Amidst Bolivia s nationwide economic collapse and growing national unrest over the state of the economy  the Bolivian government was forced to withdraw the water contract  Bolivian commercial exports were  1 3 billion in 2002  from a low of  652 million in 1991  Imports were  1 7 billion in 2002  Bolivian tariffs are a uniformly low 10   with capital equipment charged only 5   Bolivia s trade deficit was  460 million in 2002  Bolivia s trade with neighboring countries is growing  in part because of several regional preferential trade agreements it has negotiated  Bolivia is a member of the Andean Community of Nations and enjoys nominally free trade with other member countries  The United States remains Bolivia s largest trading partner  excepting natural resources  such as natural gas   In 2002  the United States exported  283 million of merchandise to Bolivia and imported  162 million  Agriculture accounts for roughly 15  of Bolivia s GDP  Soybeans are the major cash crop  sold into the Andean Community market  Bolivian coca growing is both economically and political important  Bolivia s government remains heavily dependent on foreign assistance to finance development projects  At the end of 2002  the government owed  4 5 billion to its foreign creditors  with  1 6 billion of this amount owed to other governments and most of the balance owed to multilateral development banks  Most payments to other governments have been rescheduled on several occasions since 1987 through the Paris Club mechanism  External creditors have been willing to do this because the Bolivian government has generally achieved the monetary and fiscal targets set by IMF programs since 1987  though economic crises in recent years have undercut Bolivia s normally good record  The rescheduling of agreements granted by the Paris Club has allowed the individual creditor countries to apply very soft terms to the rescheduled debt  As a result  some countries have forgiven substantial amounts of Bolivia s bilateral debt  The U S  government reached an agreement at the Paris Club meeting in December 1995 that reduced by 67  Bolivia s existing debt stock  The Bolivian government continues to pay its debts to the multilateral development banks on time  Bolivia is a beneficiary of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries  HIPC  and Enhanced HIPC debt relief programs  which by agreement restricts Bolivia s access to new soft loans  The income from tourism becomes increasingly important  Bolivia s tourist industry has grown gradually since
