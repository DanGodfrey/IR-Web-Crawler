Geography of Niger Map of Niger The Erg of Bilma in the east of Niger  Satellite image of Niger Niger is a landlocked nation in West Africa located along the border between the Sahara and Sub Saharan regions  It lies between latitudes 11  and 24 N  and longitudes 0  and 16 E  Niger s area is 1 267 000 square kilometres  489 191 sq mi  of which 300 square kilometres  116 sq mi  is water  This makes it slightly less than twice the size of the US state of Texas  and the world s twenty second largest country  after Chad   Niger borders seven countries and has a total perimeter of 5 697 kilometres

subsumed into the inhospitable Sahara desert in the last two thousand years  five thousand years ago the north of the country was fertile grasslands  Populations of pastoralists have left paintings of abundant wildlife  domesticated animals  chariots  and a complex culture that dates back to at least 10 000 BCE  Several former northern villages and archaeological sites date from the Green Sahara period of 7 500 7 000 to 3 500 3 000 BCE  7  Early historical period Overlooking the town of Zinder and the Sultan s Palace from the French fort  1906   The arrival of the French spelled a sudden end for precolonial states like the Sultanate of Damagaram  which carried on only as ceremonial  chiefs  appointed by the colonial government  The Songhai Empire expanded into what is modern Niger from the 15th century  reaching as far as Agadez before its collapse in 1591  from which the modern Zarma and Songhai peoples trace their history  At its fall  portions of the empire and refugees from modern Mali formed a series of Songhai states  with the Dendi Kingdom becoming the most powerful  From the 13th century  the nomadic Tuareg formed large confederations  pushed southward  into the A r Mountains  displacing some previous residents to the south  At their peak  the Tuareg confederations ruled most of what is now northern Niger  and extended their influence into modern Nigeria  In the 18th century  Fula pastoralists moved into the Liptako area of the west  while smaller Zarma kingdoms  siding with various Hausa states  clashed with the expanding Fulani Empire of Sokoto from the south  The colonial border with British Nigeria was in part based on the rupture between the Sokoto Caliphate to the south  and Hausa ruling dynasties which had fled to the north  In the far east around the Lake Chad basin  the successive expansion of the Kanem Empire and Bornu Empire spread ethnically Kanuri and Toubou rulers and their subject states as far west as Zinder and the Kaouar Oases from the 10th to the 17th centuries  The Kaouar escarpment  forming an oasis in the T n r  desert  In the 19th century  contact with the West began when the first European explorers   notably Mungo Park  British  and Heinrich Barth  German    explored the area  searching for the source of the Niger River  Although French efforts at  pacification  began before 1900  dissident ethnic groups  especially the desert Tuareg  were not fully subdued until 1922  when Niger became a French colony  Niger s colonial history and development parallel that of other French West African territories  France administered its West African colonies through a governor general in Dakar  Senegal  and governors in the individual territories  including Niger  In addition to conferring French citizenship on the inhabitants of the territories  the 1946 French constitution provided for decentralization of power and limited participation in political life for local advisory assemblies  Early independence A further revision in the organization of overseas territories occurred with the passage of the Overseas Reform Act  Loi Cadre  of 23 July 1956  followed by reorganizing measures enacted by the French Parliament early in 1957  In addition to removing voting inequalities  these laws provided for creation of governmental organs  assuring individual territories a large measure of self government  After the establishment of the Fifth French Republic on 4 December 1958  Niger became an autonomous state within the French Community  Following full independence on 3 August 1960  however  membership was allowed to lapse  Single party and military rule  1961 1991  President Hamani Diori and visiting German President Dr  Heinrich L bke greet crowds on a state visit to Niamey  1969  Diori s single party rule was characterized by good relations with the west and a preoccupation with foreign affairs  For its first fourteen years as an independent state  Niger was run by a single party civilian regime under the presidency of Hamani Diori  In 1974  a combination of devastating drought and accusations of rampant corruption resulted in a coup d  tat that overthrew the Diori regime  Col  Seyni Kountch  and a small military group ruled the country until Kountch  s death in 1987  8  He was succeeded by his Chief of Staff  Col  Ali Saibou  who released political prisoners  liberalized some of Niger s laws and policies  and promulgated a new constitution  with the creation of a single party constitutional Second Republic  However  President Saibou s efforts to control political reforms failed in the face of union and student demands to institute a multi party democratic system  The Saibou regime acquiesced to these demands by the end of 1990  New political parties and civic associations sprang up  and a national peace conference was convened in July 1991 to prepare the way for the adoption of a new constitution and the holding of free and fair elections  The debate was often contentious and accusatory  but under the leadership of Prof  Andr  Salifou  the conference developed a plan for a transition government  Third Republic This caretaker government was installed in November 1991 to manage the affairs of state until the institutions of the Third Republic were put into place in April 1993  While the economy deteriorated over the course of the transition  certain accomplishments stand out  including the successful conduct of a constitutional referendum  the adoption of key legislation such as the electoral and rural codes  and the holding of several free  fair  and non violent nationwide elections  Freedom of the press flourished with the appearance of several new independent newspapers  The results of the January 1995 parliamentary election meant cohabitation between a rival president and prime minister  this led to governmental paralysis  which provided Col  Ibrahim Bar  Ma nassara a rationale to overthrow the Third Republic in January 1996  Military rule and the Fourth Republic While leading a military authority that ran the government  Conseil de Salut National  during a 6 month transition period  Bar  enlisted specialists to draft a new constitution for a Fourth Republic announced in May 1996  Bar  organized a presidential election in July 1996  While voting was still going on  he replaced the electoral commission  The new commission declared him the winner after the polls closed  His party won 57  of parliament seats in a flawed legislative election in November 1996  When his efforts to justify his coup and subsequent questionable elections failed to convince donors to restore multilateral and bilateral economic assistance  a desperate Bar  ignored an international embargo against Libya and sought Libyan funds to aid Niger s economy  In repeated violations of basic civil liberties by the regime  opposition leaders were imprisoned  journalists often arrested  and deported by an unofficial militia composed of police and military  and independent media offices were looted and burned  As part of an initiative started under the 1991 national conference  however  the government signed peace accords in April 1995 with all  meaning Tuareg and Toubou groups that had been in rebellion since 1990  The Tuareg claimed they lacked attention and resources from the central government  The government agreed to absorb some former rebels into the military and  with French assistance  help others return to a productive civilian life  Mamadou Tandja  Deposed President of the Republic of Niger Fifth Republic since 1999 On 9 April 1999  Bar  was killed in a coup led by Maj  Daouda Malam Wank   who established a transitional National Reconciliation Council to oversee the drafting of a constitution for a Fifth Republic with a French style semi presidential system  In votes that international observers found to be generally free and fair  the Nigerien electorate approved the new constitution in July 1999 and held legislative and presidential elections in October and November 1999  Heading a coalition of the National Movement for a Developing Society  MNSD  and the Democratic and Social Convention  CDS   Mamadou Tandja won the election  The new second term government of the Fifth Republic took office on 30 December 2002  In August 2002  serious unrest within the military occurred in Niamey  Diffa  and Nguigmi  but the government was able to restore order within several days  A Nigerien rebel fighter  February 2008 The legislature elected in December 2004 contained seven political parties  President Mamadou Tandja was re elected in December 2004 and reappointed Hama Amadou as Prime Minister  Mahamane Ousmane  the head of the CDS  was re elected President of the National Assembly  parliament  by his peers  In June 2007  Seyni Oumarou was nominated as the new Prime Minister after Hama Amadou was democratically forced out of office by the National Assembly through a motion of no confidence  From 2007 to 2008  the Second Tuareg Rebellion took place in northern Niger  worsening economic prospects and shutting down political progress  In a February 2010 coup d  tat  a military junta was established in response to Tandja s attempted extension of his political term through constitutional manipulation  The coup established a junta led by the Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy  which then held elections in 2011 that were judged internationally to be free and fair  Politics Main article  Politics of Niger Niger s new constitution was approved in July 1999  It restored the semi presidential system of government of the December 1992 constitution  Third Republic  in which the president of the republic  elected by universal suffrage for a five year term  and a prime minister named by the president share executive power  As a reflection of Niger s increasing population  the unicameral National Assembly was expanded in 2004 to 113 deputies elected for a 5 year term under a majority system of representation  Political parties must attain at least 5  of the vote in order to gain a seat in the legislature  The constitution also provides for the popular election of municipal and local officials  and the first ever successful municipal elections took place on 24 July 2004  The National Assembly passed in June 2002 a series of decentralization bills  As a first step  administrative powers will be distributed among 265 communes  local councils   in later stages  regions and departments will be established as decentralized entities  A new electoral code was adopted to reflect the decentralization context  The country is currently divided into 8 regions  which are subdivided into 36 districts  departments   The chief administrator  Governor  in each department is appointed by the government and functions primarily as the local agent of the central authorities  On 26 May 2009  President Tandja dissolved parliament after the country s constitutional court ruled against plans to hold a referendum on whether to allow him a third term in office  According to the constitution  a new parliament was elected within three months  9  This touched off a political struggle between Tandja  trying to extend his term limited authority beyond 2009 through the establishment of a Sixth Republic  and his opponents who demanded that he step down at the end of his second term in December 2009  See 2009 Nigerien constitutional crisis  The military took over the country and President Tandja was put in prison  charged with corruption  The military kept their promise to return the country to democratic civilian rule  A constitutional referendum and national elections were held  A presidential election was held on on 31 January 2011  but as no clear winner emerged  run off elections were held on 12 March 2011  Mahamadou Issoufou of the Nigerien Party for Democracy and Socialism was elected president  A parliamentary election was held at the same time  10  11  12  Regions  departments  and communes Administrative subdivisions of the Republic of Niger  1992 2002  Main articles  Regions of Niger  Departments of Niger  and Communes of Niger Niger is divided into 7 Regions and one capital district  These Regions are subdivided into 36 departments  The 36 Departments are currently broken down into Communes of varying types  As of 2006 there were 265 communes  including communes urbaines  Urban Communes  as subdivisions of major cities   communes rurales  Rural Communes  in sparsely populated areas and postes administratifs  Administrative Posts  for largely uninhabited desert areas or military zones  Rural communes may contain official villages and settlements  while Urban Communes are divided into quarters  Niger subvisions were renamed in 2002  in the implementation of a decentralisation project  first begun in 1998  Previously  Niger was divided into 7 Departments  36 Arrondissements  and Communes  These subdivisions were administered by officials appointed by the national government  These offices will be replaced in the future by democratically elected councils at each level  The pre 2002 departments  renamed as regions  and capital district   Agadez Region Diffa Region Dosso Region Maradi Region Tahoua Region Tillab ri Region Zinder Region Niamey  capital district  Foreign relations Niger s flag flying at the embassy in Accra  Ghana Main article  Foreign relations of Niger Niger pursues a moderate foreign policy and maintains friendly relations with the West and the Islamic world as well as nonaligned countries  It belongs to the UN and its main specialized agencies and in 1980 81 served on the UN Security Council  Niger maintains a special relationship with former colonial power France and enjoys close relations with its West African neighbors  It is a charter member of the African Union and the West African Monetary Union and also belongs to the Niger Basin Authority and Lake Chad Basin Commission  the Economic Community of West African States  the Non Aligned Movement  the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa  OHADA   The westernmost regions of Niger are joined with contiguous regions Mali and Burkina Faso under the Liptako Gourma Authority  The border dispute with Benin  inherited from colonial times and concerning inter alia Lete Island in the River Niger was finally solved by the ICJ in 2005 to Niger s advantage  Military Further information  Niger Armed Forces The Niger Armed Forces total 12 000 personnel with approximately 3 700 gendarmes  300 air force  and 6 000 army personnel  The air force has four operational transport aircraft  The armed forces include general staff and battalion task force organizations consisting of two paratroop units  four light armored units  and nine motorized infantry units located in Tahoua  Agadez  Dirkou  Zinder  Nguigmi  N Gourti  and Madewela  Since January 2003  Niger has deployed a company of troops to C te d Ivoire as part of the ECOWAS stabilization force  In 1991  Niger sent four hundred military personnel to join the American led allied forces against Iraq during the Gulf War  Nigerien soldiers in 2007 Niger s defense budget is modest  accounting for about 1 6  of government expenditures  France provides the largest share of military assistance to Niger  Morocco  Algeria  China  and Libya have also provided military assistance  Approximately 15 French military advisers are in Niger  Many Nigerien military personnel receive training in France  and the Nigerien Armed Forces are equipped mainly with military hardware either sold or donated by France  In the past  U S  assistance focused on training pilots and aviation support personnel  professional military education for staff officers  and initial specialty training for junior officers  A small foreign military assistance program was initiated in 1983  A U S  Defense Attach  office opened in June 1985 and assumed Security Assistance Office responsibilities in 1987  The office closed in 1996 following a coup d  tat  A U S  Defense Attach  office reopened in July 2000  The United States provided transportation and logistical assistance to Nigerien troops deployed to Cote d Ivoire in 2003  Additionally  the U S  provided initial equipment training on vehicles and communications gear to a select contingent of Nigerien soldiers as part of the Department of State Pan Sahel Initiative  In February 2010  the army of Niger staged another coup d  tat  that ousted President Tandja Mamadou  who had been behaving in an increasingly dictatorial fashion  The army claims to be acting toward the restoration of democracy  Transport Main article  Transport in Niger The road border entering Niger from Benin at Gaya  Niger relies on its neighbors  especially Benin and Nigeria  for seaports which provide access to world markets  Transport is crucial to the economy and culture of this vast landlocked nation  with cities separated by huge uninhabited deserts  mountain ranges  and other natural features  Niger s transport system was little developed during the colonial period  1899 1960   relying upon animal transport  human transport  and limited river transport in the far south west and south east  No railways were constructed in the colonial period  and most roads outside the capital remained unpaved  The Niger River is unsuitable for river transport of any large scale  as it lacks depth for most of the year  and is broken by rapids at many spots  Camel caravan transport was historically important in the Sahara desert and Sahel regions which cover most of the north  Road Road transport  especially shared taxis  buses  and trucks  are the primary form of long distance transport for most Nigeriens  There were 10 100 km of roads in the nation in 1996  but only 798 km were paved  Most of this total was in large cities and in two main highways  The first major paved highway was constructed in the 1970s and 80s to transport uranium from the far northern mining town of Arlit to the Benin border   Much of Niger s export economy relies upon ports in Cotonou  Lom   and Port Harcourt   This road  dubbed the Uranium Highway runs through Arlit  Agadez  Tahoua  Birnin Konni  and Niamey  and is part of the Trans Sahara Highway system  The paved RN1   Routes Nationale   runs east west across the south of the nation  from Niamey via Maradi and Zinder towards Diffa in the far east of the nation  although the stretch from Zinder to Diffa is only partially paved  Other roads range from all weather laterite surfaces to grated dirt or sand pistes  especially in the desert north  These form a more extensive numbered highway system  Air transport Niger s main international airport is Diori Hamani International Airport at Niamey  Other airports in Niger include Mano Dayak International Airport at Agadez and Zinder Airport near Zinder  Economy Main article  Economy of Niger Niamey  Niger s capital and economic hub The economy of Niger centers on subsistence crops  livestock  and some of the world s largest uranium deposits  Drought cycles  desertification  a 2 9  population growth rate  and the drop in world demand for uranium have undercut the economy  Niger shares a common currency  the CFA franc  and a common central bank  the Central Bank of West African States  BCEAO   with seven other members of the West African Monetary Union  Niger is also a member of the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa  OHADA   13  In December 2000  Niger qualified for enhanced debt relief under the International Monetary Fund program for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries  HIPC  and concluded an agreement with the Fund for Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility  PRGF   Debt relief provided under the enhanced HIPC initiative significantly reduces Niger s annual debt service obligations  freeing funds for expenditures on basic health care  primary education  HIV AIDS prevention  rural infrastructure  and other programs geared at poverty reduction  In December 2005  it was announced that Niger had received 100  multilateral debt relief from the IMF  which translates into the forgiveness of approximately  86 million USD in debts to the IMF  excluding the remaining assistance under HIPC  Nearly half of the government s budget is derived from foreign donor resources  Future growth may be sustained by exploitation of oil  gold  coal  and other mineral resources  Uranium prices have recovered somewhat in the last few years  A drought and locust infestation in 2005 led to food shortages for as many as 2 5 million Nigeriens  Agriculture Main article  Agriculture in Niger The fertile south of Niger near the Niger River The agricultural economy is based largely upon internal markets  subsistence agriculture  and the export of raw commodities  food stuffs and cattle to neighbors  14  Niger s agricultural and livestock sectors are the mainstay of all but 18  of the population  14  14  of Niger s GDP is generated by livestock production  camels  goats  sheep and cattle   said to support 29  of the population  Thus 53  of the population is actively involved in crop production  14  The 15  of Niger s land that is arable is found mainly along its southern border with Nigeria  Drought has turned farmland into useless soil  A farmer examines the soil in drought stricken Niger during the 2005 famine  Nomads leaving for Nigeria with their herds  Dakoro Department  Niger  2005 In these areas  Pearl millet  sorghum  and cassava are the principal rain fed subsistence crops  Irrigated rice for internal consumption is grown in parts of the Niger River valley in the west  While expensive  it has  since the devaluation of the CFA franc  sold for below the price of imported rice  encouraging additional production  Cowpeas and onions are grown for commercial export  as are small quantities of garlic  peppers  potatoes  and wheat  Oasis farming in small patches of the north of the country produces onions  dates  and some market vegetables for export  14  But for the most part  rural residents engaged in crop tending are clustered in the south centre and south west of the nation  in those areas  the Sahel  which can expect to receive between 300 to 600 mm  12 to 24 in  of rainfall annually  A small area in the southern tip of the nation  surrounding Gaya can expect to receive 700 to 900 mm  28 to 35 in  or rainfall  Northern areas which support crops  such as the southern portions of the A r Massif and the Kaouar oasis  rely upon oases and a slight increase in rainfall due to mountain effects  Large portions of the northwest and far east of the nation  while within the Sahara desert  see just enough seasonal rainfall to support semi nomadic animal husbandry  The populations of these areas  mostly Tuareg  Wodaabe   Fula  and Toubou  travel south  a process called transhumance  to pasture and sell animals in the dry season  north into the Sahara in the brief rainy season  8  Rainfall varies and when it is insufficient  Niger has difficulty feeding its population and must rely on grain purchases and food aid to meet food requirements  14  Rains  as in much of the Sahel  have been marked by annual variability  This has been especially true in the 20th century  with the most severe drought on record beginning in the late 1960s and lasting  with one break  well into the 1980s  The long term effect of this  especially to pastoralist populations  remains in the 21st century  with those communities which rely upon cattle  sheep  and camels husbandry losing entire herds more than once during this period  Recent rains remain variable  For instance  the rains in 2000 were not good  those in 2001 were plentiful and well distributed  The Kandadji Dam on the Niger River  whose construction started in August 2008  is expected to improve agricultural production in the Tillaberi Department by providing water for the irrigation of 6 000 hectares initially and of 45 000 hectares by 2034  15  Exports Uranium is Niger s largest export  Foreign exchange earnings from livestock  although difficult to quantify  are second  Actual exports far exceed official statistics  which often fail to detect large herds of animals informally crossing into Nigeria  Some hides and skins are exported  and some are transformed into handicrafts  Substantial deposits of phosphates  coal  iron  limestone  and gypsum also have been found in Niger  Uranium Main article  Mining in Niger The persistent uranium price slump has brought lower revenues for Niger s uranium sector  although uranium still provides 72  of national export proceeds  The nation enjoyed substantial export earnings and rapid economic growth during the 1960s and 1970s after the opening of two large uranium mines near the northern town of Arlit  When the uranium led boom ended in the early 1980s  however  the economy stagnated  and new investment since then has been limited  Niger s two uranium mines   SOMAIR s open pit mine and COMINAK s underground mine   are owned by a French led consortium and operated by French interests  However  as of 2007  many licences have been given to other companies from countries such as India  Canada and Australia in order to exploit new deposits  A farmer collecting millet in Koremairwa village in the Dosso department  Gold Exploitable deposits of gold are known to exist in Niger in the region between the Niger River and the border with Burkina Faso  On 5 October 2004  President Tandja announced the official opening of the Samira Hill Gold Mine in Tera Department and the first Nigerien gold ingot was presented to him  This marked a historical moment for Niger as the Samira Hill Gold Mine represents the first commercial gold production in the country  Samira Hill is owned by a company called SML  Societe des Mines du Liptako  which is a joint venture between a Moroccan company  Societe Semafo  and a Canadian company  Etruscan Resources  Both companies own 80   40    40   of SML and the Government of Niger 20   The first year s production is predicted to be 135 000 troy ounces  4 200 kg  9 260 lb avoirdupois  of gold at a cash value of USD 177 per ounce   5 70 g   The mine reserves for the Samira Hill mine total 10 073 626 tons at an average grade of 2 21 grams per ton from which 618 000 troy ounces  19 200 kg  42 400 lb  will be recovered over a 6 year mine life  SML believes to have a number of significant gold deposits within what is now recognized as the gold belt known as the  Samira Horizon   which is located between Gotheye and Ouallam  16  Coal The parastatal SONICHAR  Soci t  Nigerienne de Charbon  in Tchirozerine  north of Agadez  extracts coal from an open pit and fuels an electricity generating plant that

pipeline out of the nation  The government estimates the area has reserves of 324 million barrels  51 500 000 m3   and is seeking further oil in the Tenere Desert and near Bilma  Niger has said that it hopes to produce its first barrels of oil for sale by 2009  17  Growth rates The economic competitiveness created by the January 1994 devaluation of the Communaut  Financi re Africaine  CFA  franc contributed to an annual average economic growth of 3 5  throughout the mid 1990s  But the economy stagnated due to the sharp reduction in foreign aid in 1999  which gradually resumed in 2000  and poor rains in 2000  Reflecting the importance of the agricultural sector  the return of good rains was the primary factor underlying economic growth of 5 1  in 2000  3 1  in 2001  6 0  in 2002  and 3 0  in 2003  In recent years  the Government of Niger drafted revisions to the investment code  1997 and 2000   petroleum code  1992   and mining code  1993   all with attractive terms for investors  The present government actively seeks foreign private investment and considers it key to restoring economic growth and development  With the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme  UNDP   it has undertaken a concerted effort to revitalize the private sector  A market in Maradi  Economic restructuring and debt In January 2000  Niger s newly elected government inherited serious financial and economic problems including a virtually empty treasury  past due salaries  11 months of arrears  and scholarship payments  increased debt  reduced revenue performance  and lower public investment  In December 2000  Niger qualified for enhanced debt relief under the International Monetary Fund program for Highly Indebted Poor Countries and concluded an agreement with the Fund on a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility  PRGF   14  In addition to changes in the budgetary process and public finances  the new government has pursued economic restructuring towards the IMF promoted privatization model  This has included the privatization of water distribution and telecommunications and the removal of price protections for petroleum products  allowing prices to be set by world market prices  Further privatizations of public enterprises are in the works  In its effort to comply with the IMF s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility plan  the government also is taking actions to reduce corruption and  as the result of a participatory process encompassing civil society  has devised a Poverty Reduction Strategy Plan that focuses on improving health  primary education  rural infrastructure  and judicial restructuring  14  A long planned privitisation of the Nigerien power company  NIGELEC  failed in 2001 and again in 2003 due to inaudibility to line up buyers  SONITEL  the nation s telephone operator  hived of the post office and privatised in 2001  was renationalised in 2009  Critics have argued that the obligations to creditor institutions and governments have locked Niger in to a process of trade liberalization that is harmful for small farmers and in particular  rural women  18  A rural mother tends to her malnourished infant at the Maradi MSF aid centre  during the 2005 2006 Niger food crisis  While the Maradi Region is the breadbasket of Niger  the 20th century saw three severe Sahel droughts which brought dramatic food insecurity to even the most fertile regions of Niger  Foreign aid The most important donors in Niger are France  the European Union  the World Bank  the IMF and other United Nations agencies  UNDP  UNICEF  FAO  WFP  and UNFPA   Other principal donors include the United States  Belgium  Germany  Switzerland  Canada  and Saudi Arabia  While USAID does not have an office in Niger  the United States is a major donor  contributing nearly  10 million each year to Niger s development  The U S  also is a major partner in policy coordination in such areas as food security and HIV AIDS  The importance of external support for Niger s development is demonstrated by the fact that about 45  of the government s FY 2002 budget  including 80  of its capital budget  derives from donor resources  14  In 2005 the UN drew attention to the increased need for foreign aid given severe problems with drought and locusts resulting in the 2005 06 Niger food crisis  endangering the lives around a million people  2010 famine Main article  2010 Sahel drought In June to August 2010  famine struck the Sahel  19  Niger s crops to failed to mature in the heat and famine developed  350 000 faced starvation and 1 200 000 were at risk of famine  20  In Chad  the temperature reached 47 6  C  118  F  on 22 June in Faya Largeau  breaking a record set in 1961 at the same location  Niger tied its highest temperature record set in 1998  on also 22 June  at 47 1  C  117  F  in Bilma  That record was broken the next day  on 23 June when Bilma hit 48 2  C  119  F   The hottest temperature recorded in Sudan was reached on 25 June  at 49 6  C  121  F  in Dongola  breaking a record set in 1987  21  Niger reported diarrhoea  starvation  gastroenteritis  malnutrition and respiratory diseases killed and sickened many children 14 July  The new military junta is appealing for international food aid and has taken serious steps to calling overseas help since coming to office in February 2010  22  On 26 July  the heat reached near record levels over Chad and Niger  23  Demographics Main article  Demographics of Niger Over half the population of Niger belong to the Hausa  24  who also constitute the major ethnic group in northern Nigeria  and the Zarma Songhai  who also are found in parts of Mali  Both groups  along with the Gourmantche  are sedentary farmers who live in the arable  southern tier of the country  Nigerien Zarma Songhai girls in traditional clothing The remainder of Nigeriens are nomadic or semi nomadic livestock raising peoples Fulani  Tuareg  Kanuri  Arabs  and Toubou who make up about 20  of Niger s population  25  With rapidly growing populations and the consequent competition for meager natural resources  lifestyles of agriculturalists and livestock herders have come increasingly into conflict in Niger in recent years  26  A Nigerien study has found that more than 800 000 people are enslaved  almost 8  of the population  27  28  29  Health Main article  Health in Niger Niger s high infant mortality rate is comparable to levels recorded in neighboring countries  However  the child mortality rate  deaths among children between the ages of 1 and 4  is exceptionally high  248 per 1 000  due to generally poor health conditions and inadequate nutrition for most of the country s children  According to the organization Save the Children  Niger has the world s highest infant mortality rate  30  Nonetheless  Niger has the highest fertility rate in the world  7 2 births per woman   this means that nearly half  49   of the Nigerien population is under age 15  There were 3 physicians and 22 nurses per 100 000 persons in 2004  citation needed  Education Main article  Education in Niger A primary classroom in Niger  Primary education in Niger is compulsory for six years  31  The primary school enrollment and attendance rates are low  particularly for girls  31  In 1997  the gross primary enrollment rate was 29 3 percent  and in 1996  the net primary enrollment rate was 24 5 percent  31  About 60 percent of children who finish primary schools are boys  as the majority of girls rarely attend school for more than a few years  31  Children are often forced to work rather than attend school  particularly during planting or harvest periods  31  In addition  nomadic children in the north of the country often do not have access to schools  31  Culture and religion Main article  Culture of Niger Horsemen at the traditional Ramadan festival at the Sultan s Palace in the Hausa city of Zinder  A traditional home in Zinder Nigerien culture is marked by variation  evidence of the cultural crossroads which French colonialism formed into a unified state from the beginning of the 20th century  What is now Niger was created from four distinct cultural areas in the pre colonial era  the Zarma dominated Niger River valley in the southwest  the northern periphery of Hausaland  made mostly of those states which had resisted the Sokoto Caliphate  and ranged along the long southern border with Nigeria  the Lake Chad basin and Kaouar in the far east  populated by Kanuri farmers and Toubou pastoralists who had once been part of the Kanem Bornu Empire  and the Tuareg nomads of the A r Mountains and Saharan desert in the vast north  Each of these communities  along with smaller ethnic groups like the pastoral Wodaabe Fula  brought their own cultural traditions to the new state of Niger  While successive post independence governments have tried to forge a shared national culture  this has been slow forming  in part because the major Nigerien communities have their own cultural histories  and in part because Nigerien ethnic groups such as the Hausa  Tuareg and Kanuri are but part of larger ethnic communities which cross borders introduced under colonialism  Until the 1990s  government and politics was inordinately dominated by Niamey and the Zarma people of the surrounding region  At the same time the plurality of the population  in the Hausa borderlands between Birni N Konni and Maine Soroa  have often looked culturally more to Hausaland in Nigeria than Niamey  Between 1996 and 2003  primary school attendance was around 30   32  including 36  of males and only 25  of females  Additional education occurs through madrassas  Religion Main article  Religion in Niger A mosque in Niamey Religion in Niger religion percent Islam    90  Christianity    5  Animism    4  Other    1  Islam  spread from North Africa beginning in the 10th century  has greatly shaped the mores of the people of Niger  Between 80 to more than 98  of the population is Muslim  with small Animist and Christian communities  the latter a consequence of missionaries established during the French colonial years  as well as urban expatriate communities from Europe and West Africa  Islam Main article  Islam in Niger Approximately 95  of Muslims in Niger are Sunni and Sufi  33  5  are Shi a  34  Islam was spread into what is now Niger beginning in the 15th century  by both the expansion of the Songhai Empire in the west  and the influence of the Trans Saharan trade traveling from the Maghreb and Egypt  Tuareg expansion from the north  culminating in their seizure of the far eastern oases from the Kanem Bornu Empire in the 17th centuries  spread distinctively Berber practices  Both Zarma and Hausa areas were greatly influenced by the 18th and 19th century Fula led Sufi brotherhoods  most notably the Sokoto Caliphate  in today s Nigeria   Modern Muslim practice in Niger is often tied to the Tijaniya Sufi brotherhoods  although there are small minority groups tied to Hammallism and Nyassist Sufi orders in the west  and the Sanusiya in the far northeast  33  A small center of Wahhabite followers have appeared in the last thirty years in the capital and in Maradi  35  These small groups  linked to similar groups in Jos  Nigeria  came to public prominence in the 1990s during a series of religious riots 36  37  38  Despite this  Niger maintains a tradition as a secular state  protected by law  39  Interfaith relations are deemed very good  and the forms of Islam traditionally practiced in most of the country is marked by tolerance of other faiths and lack of restrictions on personal freedom  40  Divorce and polygyny are unremarkable  women are not secluded  and headcoverings are not mandatory   they are often a rarity in urban areas  41  Alcohol  such as the locally produced Bi re Niger  is sold openly in most of the country  Animism A small percentage of the population practices traditional indigenous religious beliefs  34  The numbers of Animist practitioners are a point of contention  As recently as the late 19th century  much of the south centre of the nation was unreached by Islam  and the conversion of some rural areas has been only partial  There are still areas where animist based festivals and traditions  such as the Bori religion  are practiced by syncretic Muslim communities  in some Hausa areas as well as among some Toubou and Wodaabe pastoralists   as opposed to several small communities who maintain their pre Islamic religion  These include the Hausa speaking Maouri  or Azna  the Hausa word for  pagan   community in Dogondoutci in the south southwest and the Kanuri speaking Manga near Zinder  both of whom practice variations of the pre Islamic Hausa Maguzawa religion  There are also some tiny Boudouma and Songhay animist communities in the southwest  33  Media Main article  Media of Niger Niger began developing diverse media in the late 1990s  Prior to the Third Republic  Nigeriens only had access to tightly controlled state media  42  Now Niamey boasts scores of newspapers and magazines  some  like Le Sahel  are government operated  while many are critical of the government  43  44  Radio is the most important medium  as television sets are beyond the buying power of many of the rural poor  and illiteracy prevents print media from becoming a mass medium  45  In addition to the national and regional radio services of the state broadcaster ORTN  there are four privately owned radio networks which total more than 100 stations  Three of them   the Anfani Group  Sarounia and Tenere   are urban based commercial format FM networks in the major towns  46  There is also a network of over 80 community radio stations spread across all seven regions of the country  governed by the Comit  de Pilotage de Radios de Proximit   CPRP   a civil society organisation  The independent sector radio networks are collectively estimated by CPRP officials to cover some 7 6 million people  or about 73  of the population  2005   Aside from Nigerien radio stations  the BBC s Hausa service is listened to on FM repeaters across wide parts of the country  particularly in the south  close to the border with Nigeria  Radio France Internationale also rebroadcasts in French through some of the commercial stations  via satellite  Tenere FM also runs a national independent television station of the same name  46  Despite relative freedom at the national level  Nigerien journalists say they are often pressured by local authorities  47  The state ORTN network depends financially on the government  partly through a surcharge on electricity bills  and partly through direct subsidy  The sector is governed by the Conseil Sup rieur de Communications  established as an independent body in the early 1990s  since 2007 headed by Daouda Diallo  International human rights groups have criticised government since at least 1996 as using regulation and police to punish criticism of the state
