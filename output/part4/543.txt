led by the United States and the United Kingdom with the support of other NATO as well as non NATO countries  Originally  the campaign was waged against al Qaeda and other militant organizations with the purpose of eliminating them  1  The phrase  War on Terror  was first used by US President George W  Bush and other high ranking US officials to denote a global military  political  legal and ideological struggle against organizations designated as terrorist and regimes that were accused of having a connection to them or providing them with support or were perceived  or presented as posing a threat to the US and its allies in general  It was typically used with a particular focus on militant Islamists and al Qaeda  Although the term is not officially used by the administration of US President Barack Obama  which instead uses the term Overseas Contingency Operation   it is still commonly used by politicians  in the media and officially by some aspects of government  such as the

External links Precursor to the 9 11 attacks See also  Terrorism and List of terrorist incidents The origins of al Qaeda as a network inspiring terrorism around the world and training operatives can be traced to the Soviet war in Afghanistan  December 1979   February 1989   2  In May 1996 the group World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders  WIFJAJC   sponsored by Osama bin Laden and later reformed as al Qaeda  started forming a large base of operations in Afghanistan  where the Islamist extremist regime of the Taliban had seized power that same year  3  In February 1998  Osama bin Laden signed a fatw   as the head of al Qaeda  declaring war on the West and Israel  4  5  later in May of that same year al Qaeda released a video declaring war on the US and the West  6  7  Following the bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania  8 US President Bill Clinton launched Operation Infinite Reach  a bombing campaign in Sudan and Afghanistan against targets the US asserted were associated with WIFJAJC  9  10  although others have questioned whether a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan was used as a chemical warfare plant  The plant produced much of the region s antimalarial drugs 11  and around 50  of Sudan s pharmaceutical needs  12  The strikes failed to kill any leaders of WIFJAJC or the Taliban  11  Next came the 2000 millennium attack plots which included an attempted bombing of Los Angeles International Airport  In October 2000 the USS Cole bombing occurred  followed in 2001 by the 11 September attacks  13  Terminology The phrase  War on Terror  has been used to specifically refer to the ongoing military campaign led by the US  UK and their allies against organizations and regimes identified by them as terrorist  and excludes other independent counter terrorist operations and campaigns such as those by Russia and India  The conflict has also been referred to by names other than the War on Terror  It has also been known as  World War III 14  15  16  World War IV 17  18  19   assuming the Cold War was World War III  Bush s War on Terror 20  21  22  The Long War 23  24  The Global War of Terror 25  26  27  The War Against al Qaeda 28  29  In 1984 the Reagan Administration used the term  war against terrorism  as part of an effort to pass legislation that was designed to freeze assets of terrorist groups and marshal the forces of government against them  Author Shane Harris asserts this was a reaction to the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing  30  On 16 September 2001  at Camp David  President George W  Bush used the phrase war on terror in an unscripted and controversial comment when he said   This crusade   this war on terrorism   is going to take a while        31  Bush later apologized for this remark due to the negative connotations the term crusade has to people of Muslim faith  The word crusade was not used again  32  On 20 September 2001  during a televised address to a joint session of congress  Bush launched the war on terror when he said   Our  war on terror  begins with al Qaeda  but it does not end there  It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found  stopped and defeated   33  Bush did not say when he expected this would be achieved    US President Barack Obama has rarely used the term  but in his inaugural address on 20 January 2009  he stated  Our nation is at war  against a far reaching network of violence and hatred   34  In March 2009 the Defense Department officially changed the name of operations from  Global War on Terror  to  Overseas Contingency Operation   OCO   35  In March 2009  the Obama administration requested that Pentagon staff members avoid use of the term  instead using  Overseas Contingency Operation   35  In April 2007 the the British government announced publicly that it was abandoning the use of the phrase  War on Terror  as they found it to be less than helpful  36  This was explained more recently by Lady Eliza Manningham Buller  In her 2011 Reith lecture  the former head of MI5 said that the 9 11 attacks were  a crime  not an act of war     So I never felt it helpful to refer to a war on terror   37  Both the term and the policies it denotes have been a source of ongoing controversy  as critics argue it has been used to justify unilateral preventive war  human rights abuses and other violations of international law  38  39  US objectives   NATO   Trans Sahara initiative   Major military operations  Afghanistan   Pakistan   Iraq   Somalia   Yemen    Other allies involved in major operations

response to the 11 September attacks  It operates in the Mediterranean Sea and is designed to prevent the movement of militants or weapons of mass destruction and to enhance the security of shipping in general  41  The operation has also assisted Greece with its prevention of illegal immigration  Operation Enduring Freedom Main article  Operation Enduring Freedom Operation Enduring Freedom is the official name used by the Bush administration for the War in Afghanistan  together with three smaller military actions  under the umbrella of the Global War on Terror  These global operations are intended to seek out and destroy any al Qaeda fighters or affiliates  Operation Enduring Freedom   Afghanistan Main article  War in Afghanistan  2001 present  US Army Chinook helicopter in Afghanistan US Marines return fire on enemy forces in Marjeh  February 2010 On 20 September 2001  in the wake of the 11 September attacks  George W  Bush delivered an ultimatum to the Taliban government of Afghanistan to turn over Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda leaders operating in the country or face attack  33  The Taliban demanded evidence of bin Laden s link to the 11 September attacks and  if such evidence warranted a trial  they offered to handle such a trial in an Islamic Court  42  The US refused to provide any evidence  Subsequently  in October 2001  US forces  with UK and coalition allies  invaded Afghanistan to oust the Taliban regime  On 7 October 2001  the official invasion began with British and US forces conducting airstrike campaigns over enemy targets  Kabul  the capital city of Afghanistan  fell by mid November  The remaining al Qaeda and Taliban remnants fell back to the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan  mainly Tora Bora  In December  Coalition forces  the US and its allies  fought within that region  It is believed that Osama bin Laden escaped into Pakistan during the battle  43  44  In March 2002  the US and other NATO and non NATO forces launched Operation Anaconda with the goal of destroying any remaining al Qaeda and Taliban forces in the Shah i Kot Valley and Arma Mountains of Afghanistan  The Taliban suffered heavy casualties and evacuated the region  45  The Taliban regrouped in western Pakistan and began to unleash an insurgent style offensive against Coalition forces in late 2002  46  Throughout southern and eastern Afghanistan  firefights broke out between the surging Taliban and Coalition forces  Coalition forces responded with a series of military offensives and an increase in the amount of troops in Afghanistan  In February 2010  Coalition forces launched Operation Moshtarak in southern Afghanistan along with other military offensives in the hopes that they would destroy the Taliban insurgency once and for all  47  Peace talks are also underway between Taliban affiliated fighters and Coalition forces  Operation Enduring Freedom   Philippines Main article  Operation Enduring Freedom   Philippines US Special Forces soldier and infantrymen of the Philippine Army In January 2002  the United States Special Operations Command  Pacific deployed to the Philippines to advise and assist the Armed Forces of the Philippines in combating Filipino Islamist groups  48  The operations were mainly focused on removing the Abu Sayyaf group and Jemaah Islamiyah  JI  from their stronghold on the island of Basilan  49  The second portion of the operation was conducted as a humanitarian program called  Operation Smiles   The goal of the program was to provide medical care and services to the region of Basilan as part of a  Hearts and Minds  program  50  51  Operation Enduring Freedom   Horn of Africa Main article  Operation Enduring Freedom   Horn of Africa See also  War in Somalia  2006 2009   War in Somalia

withdrawal of the ICU This extension of Operation Enduring Freedom was titled OEF HOA  Unlike other operations contained in Operation Enduring Freedom  OEF HOA does not have a specific organization as a target  OEF HOA instead focuses its efforts to disrupt and detect militant activities in the region and to work with willing governments to prevent the reemergence of militant cells and activities  52  In October 2002  the Combined Joint Task Force   Horn of Africa  CJTF HOA  was established in Djibouti at Camp Lemonnier  53  It contains approximately 2 000 personnel including US military and special operations forces  SOF  and coalition force members  Combined Task Force 150  CTF 150   Task Force 150 consists of ships from a shifting group of nations  including Australia  Canada  France  Germany  Italy  Netherlands  Pakistan  New Zealand and the United Kingdom  The primary goal of the coalition forces is to monitor  inspect  board and stop suspected shipments from entering the Horn of Africa region and affecting the US  Operation Iraqi Freedom  Included in the operation is the training of selected armed forces units of the countries of Djibouti  Kenya and Ethiopia in counter terrorism and counter insurgency tactics  Humanitarian efforts conducted by CJTF HOA include rebuilding of schools and medical clinics and providing medical services to those countries whose forces are being trained  The program expands as part of the Trans Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative as CJTF personnel also assist in training the armed forces of Chad  Niger  Mauritania and Mali  However  the War on Terror does not include Sudan  where over 400 000 have died in an ongoing civil war  On 1 July 2006  a Web posted message purportedly written by Osama bin Laden urged Somalis to build an Islamic state in the country and warned western governments that the al Qaeda network would fight against them if they intervened there  54  Somalia has been considered a  failed state  because its official central government was weak  dominated by warlords and unable to exert effective control over the country  Beginning in mid 2006  the Islamic Courts Union  ICU   an Islamist faction campaigning on a restoration of  law and order  through Sharia law  had rapidly taken control of much of southern Somalia  On 14 December 2006  the US Assistant Secretary of State Jendayi Frazer claimed al Qaeda cell operatives were controlling the Islamic Courts Union  a claim denied by the ICU  55  By late 2006  the UN backed Transitional Federal Government  TFG  of Somalia had seen its power effectively limited to Baidoa  while the Islamic Courts Union controlled the majority of southern Somalia  including the capital of Mogadishu  On 20 December 2006  the Islamic Courts Union launched an offensive on the government stronghold of Baidoa  and saw early gains before Ethiopia intervened in favor of the government  By 26 December  the Islamic Courts Union retreated towards Mogadishu  before again retreating as TFG Ethiopian troops neared  leaving them to take Mogadishu with no resistance  The ICU then fled to Kismayo  where they fought Ethiopian TFG forces in the Battle of Jilib  The Prime Minister of Somalia claimed that three  terror suspects  from the 1998 United States embassy bombings are being sheltered in Kismayo  56  On 30 December 2006  al Qaeda deputy leader Ayman al Zawahiri called upon Muslims worldwide to fight against Ethiopia and the TFG in Somalia  57  On 8 January 2007  the US launched the Battle of Ras Kamboni by bombing Ras Kamboni using AC 130 gunships  58  On 14 September 2009  US Special Forces killed two men and wounded and captured two others near the Somali village of Baarawe  Witnesses claim that helicopters used for the operation launched from French flagged warships  but that could not be confirmed  A Somali based al Qaida affiliated group  the Al Shabaab  has confirmed the death of  sheik commander  Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan along with an unspecified number of militants  59  Nabhan  a Kenyan  was wanted in connection with the 2002 Mombasa attacks  60  Operation Enduring Freedom   Trans Sahara Main article  Operation Enduring Freedom   Trans Sahara Operation Enduring Freedom   Trans Sahara  OEF TS  is the name of the military operation conducted by the US and partner nations in the Sahara Sahel region of Africa  consisting of counter terrorism efforts and policing of arms and drug trafficking across central Africa  Iraq A British C 130J Hercules aircraft launches flare countermeasures prior to being the first coalition aircraft to land on the newly reopened military runway at Baghdad International Airport  Iraq had been listed as a State sponsor of international terrorism by the US since 1990  61  when Saddam Hussein fell out of US favor  The regime of Saddam Hussein proved a continuing problem for the UN and Iraq s neighbors in its use of chemical weapons against Iranians and Kurds  Iraqi no fly zones After the Gulf War  the US  French and British militaries instituted and began patrolling Iraqi no fly zones  to protect Iraq s Kurdish minority and Shi a Arab population both of which suffered attacks from the Hussein regime before and after the Gulf War in Iraq s northern and southern regions  respectively  US forces continued in combat zone deployments through November 1995 and launched Operation Desert Fox against Iraq in 1998 after it failed to meet US demands of  unconditional cooperation  in weapons inspections  62  Prior to Operation Desert Fox  US president Bill Clinton predicted  And mark my words  he will develop weapons of mass destruction  He will deploy them  and he will use them   Clinton also declared a desire to remove Hussein from power and in the same speech said   The hard fact is that so long as Saddam remains in power  he threatens the well being of his people  the peace of his region  the security of the world   In the aftermath of Operation Desert Fox  during December 1998  Iraq announced that it would no longer respect the no fly zones and resumed its attempts to shoot down US aircraft  Air strikes by the British and US against Iraqi anti aircraft and military targets continued over the next few years  Also in 1998  Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act  which called for regime change in Iraq on the basis of its alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction  oppression of Iraqi citizens  and attacks on other Middle Eastern countries  The George W  Bush administration called for the United Nations Security Council  UNSC  to again send weapons inspectors to Iraq to find and destroy the alleged weapons of mass destruction and called for a UNSC resolution  63 UNSC Resolution 1441 was passed unanimously  which offered Iraq  a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations  or face  serious consequences   Resolution 1441 did not authorize the use of force by member states  The Iraqi government subsequently allowed UN inspectors some access to Iraqi sites  while the US government continued to assert that Iraq was being obstructionist  64  In October 2002  a large bipartisan majority in the United States Congress authorized the president to use force if necessary to disarm Iraq in order to  prosecute the war on terrorism   65  After failing to overcome opposition from France  Russia  and China against a UNSC resolution that would sanction the use of force against Iraq  and before the UN weapons inspectors had completed their inspections  which were claimed to be fruitless by the US because of Iraq s alleged deception   the US assembled a  Coalition of the Willing  composed of nations who pledged support for its policy of regime change in Iraq  Operation Iraqi Freedom Main article  Iraq War American soldiers take cover during a firefight with guerrilla forces in the Al Doura section of Baghdad  Map of the invasion routes and major operations battles of the Iraq War as of 2007  The Iraq War began in March 2003 with an air campaign  which was immediately followed by a U S  led ground invasion  The Bush administration stated the invasion was the  serious consequences  spoken of in the UNSC Resolution 1441  The Bush administration also stated the Iraq war was part of the War on Terror  something later questioned or contested  Baghdad  Iraq s capital city  fell in April 2003 and Saddam Hussein s government quickly dissolved  On 1 May 2003  Bush announced that major combat operations in Iraq had ended  66  However  an insurgency arose against the U S  led coalition and the newly developing Iraqi military and post Saddam government  The insurgency  which included al Qaeda affiliated groups  led to far more coalition casualties than the invasion  Other elements of the insurgency were led by fugitive members of President Hussein s Ba ath regime  which included Iraqi nationalists and pan Arabists  Many insurgency leaders are Islamists and claim to be fighting a religious war to reestablish the Islamic Caliphate of centuries past  67  Iraq s former president  Saddam Hussein was captured by U S  forces in December 2003  He was executed in 2006  In 2004  the insurgent forces grew stronger  The US conducted attacks on insurgent strongholds in cities like Najaf and Fallujah  In January 2007  President Bush presented a new strategy for Operation Iraqi Freedom based upon counter insurgency theories and tactics developed by General David Petraeus  The Iraq War troop surge of 2007 was part of this  new way forward  and  along with US backing of Sunni groups it had previously sought to defeat  has been credited with a widely recognized dramatic decrease in violence by up to 80   Operation New Dawn The war entered a new phase on 1 September 2010  68  with the official end of US combat operations  The war was declared formally over in December 2011  69  International military support Main articles  Participants in Operation

troops in Afghanistan  The invasion of Afghanistan is seen to have been the first action of this war  and initially involved forces from the United States  the United Kingdom  and the Afghan Northern Alliance  Since the initial invasion period  these forces were augmented by troops and aircraft from Australia  Canada  Denmark  France  Italy  Netherlands  New Zealand and Norway amongst others  In 2006  there were about 33 000 troops in Afghanistan  On 12 September 2001  less than 24 hours after the 11 September attacks in New York City and Washington  D C   NATO invoked Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty and declared the attacks to be an attack against all 19 NATO member countries  Australian Prime Minister John Howard also declared that Australia would invoke the ANZUS Treaty along similar lines  70  In the following months  NATO took a wide range of measures to respond to the threat of terrorism  On 22 November 2002  the member states of the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council  EAPC  decided on a Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism which explicitly states that  EAPC States are committed to the protection and promotion of fundamental freedoms and human rights  as well as the rule of law  in combating terrorism   71  NATO started naval operations in the Mediterranean Sea designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction as well as to enhance the security of shipping in general called Operation Active Endeavour  Support for the US cooled when America made clear its determination to invade Iraq in late 2002  Even so  many of the  coalition of the willing  countries that unconditionally supported the US led military action have sent troops to Afghanistan  particular neighboring Pakistan  which has disowned its earlier support for the Taliban and contributed tens of thousands of soldiers to the conflict  Pakistan was also engaged in the War in North West Pakistan  Waziristan War   Supported by US intelligence  Pakistan was attempting to remove the Taliban insurgency and al Qaeda element from the northern tribal areas  72  International Security Assistance Force Map of countries currently contributing troops to ISAF as

December 2001 saw the creation of the NATO led International Security Assistance Force  ISAF  to assist the Afghan Transitional Administration and the first post Taliban elected government  With a renewed Taliban insurgency  it was announced in 2006 that ISAF would replace the US troops in the province as part of Operation Enduring Freedom  The British 16th Air Assault Brigade  later reinforced by Royal Marines  formed the core of the force in southern Afghanistan  along with troops and helicopters from Australia  Canada and the Netherlands  The initial force consisted of roughly 3 300 British  2 000 Canadian  1 400 from the Netherlands and 240 from Australia  along with special forces from Denmark and Estonia and small contingents from other nations  The monthly supply of cargo containers through Pakistani route to ISAF in Afghanistan is over 4 000 costing around 12 billion in Pakistani Rupees  73  74  75  76  77  Fighting in Pakistan Main article  Pakistan s role in the War

President Musharraf with President Bush Diagram of Osama bin Laden s hideout in Abbottabad  Pakistan  He was killed there on 2 May 2011  Following the 11 September 2001 attacks  former President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf sided with the US against the Taliban government in Afghanistan after an ultimatum by US President George W  Bush  Musharraf agreed to give the US the use of three airbases for Operation Enduring Freedom  United States Secretary of State Colin Powell and other administration officials met with Musharraf  On 19 September 2001  Musharraf addressed the people of Pakistan and stated that  while he opposed military tactics against the Taliban  Pakistan risked being endangered by an alliance of India and the US if it did not cooperate  In 2006  Musharraf testified that this stance was pressured by threats from the US  and revealed in his memoirs that he had  war gamed  the United States as an adversary and decided that it would end in a loss for Pakistan  78  On 12 January 2002  Musharraf gave a speech against Islamic extremism  He unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism and pledged to combat Islamic extremism and lawlessness within Pakistan itself  He stated that his government was committed to rooting out extremism and made it clear that the banned militant organizations would not be allowed to resurface under any new name  He said   the recent decision to ban extremist groups promoting militancy was taken in the national interest after thorough consultations  It was not taken under any foreign influence   79  In 2002  the Musharraf led government took a firm stand against the jihadi organizations and groups promoting extremism  and arrested Maulana Masood Azhar  head of the Jaish e Mohammed  and Hafiz Muhammad Saeed  chief of the Lashkar e Taiba  and took dozens of activists into custody  An official ban was imposed on the groups on 12 January  80  Later that year  the Saudi born Zayn al Abidn Muhammed Hasayn Abu Zubaydah was arrested by Pakistani officials during a series of joint US Pakistan raids  Zubaydah is said to have been a high ranking al Qaeda official with the title of operations chief and in charge of running al Qaeda training camps  81  Other prominent al Qaeda members were arrested in the following two years  namely Ramzi bin al Shibh  who is known to have been a financial backer of al Qaeda operations  and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed  who at the time of his capture was the third highest ranking official in al Qaeda and had been directly in charge of the planning for the 11 September attacks  In 2004  the Pakistan Army launched a campaign in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan s Waziristan region  sending in 80 000 troops  The goal of the conflict was to remove the al Qaeda and Taliban forces in the region  After the fall of the Taliban regime many members of the Taliban resistance fled to the Northern border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan where the Pakistani army had previously little control  With the logistics and air support of the United States  the Pakistani Army captured or killed numerous al Qaeda operatives such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed  wanted for his involvement in the USS Cole bombing  the Bojinka plot  and the killing of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl  The United States has carried out a campaign of Drone attacks on targets all over the Federally Administered Tribal Areas  However  the Pakistani Taliban resistance still operates there  To this day it s estimated that 15 US soldiers were killed while fighting al Qaeda and Taliban remnants in Pakistan since the War on Terror began  82  Osama bin Laden  the founder of al Qaeda  was killed on 2 May 2011  during a raid conducted by the United States special operations forces in Abbottabad

Pakistan In the three years before the attacks of 11 September  Pakistan received approximately  9 million in American military aid  In the three years after  the number increased to  4 2 billion  making it the country with the maximum funding post 9 11  Such a huge inflow of funds has raised concerns in the Indian press that these funds were given without any accountability  as the end uses not being documented  and that large portions were used to suppress civilians  human rights and to purchase weapons to contain domestic problems like the Balochistan unrest  Pakistan has stated that India has been supporting terror groups within the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Balochistan with the aim of creating unrest within the country  84  Lebanon On 20 May 2007  a conflict began in north Lebanon after fighting broke out between Fatah al Islam  an Islamist militant organization  and the Lebanese Armed Forces in Nahr al Bared  a Palestinian refugee camp near Tripoli  The conflict evolved mostly around the Siege of Nahr el Bared  but minor clashes also occurred in the Ain al Hilweh refugee camp in southern Lebanon and several bombings took place in and around Lebanon s capital  Beirut  Fatah al Islam has been described as a militant mujahid 85  movement that draws inspiration from al Qaeda  85  The US provided military aid to the Lebanese government during the conflict  On 7 September 2007  Lebanese government forces captured the camp and declared victory  Yemen The United States has also conducted a series of military strikes on al Qaeda militants in Yemen since the War on Terror began  86  Yemen has a weak central government and a powerful tribal system that leaves large lawless areas open for militant training and operations  Al Qaida has a strong presence in the country  87  The US  in an effort to support Yemeni counter terrorism efforts  has increased their military aid package to Yemen from less than  11 million in 2006 to more than  70 million in 2009  as well as providing up to  121 million for development over the next three years  88  Post 9 11 events inside the United States A US Immigration and Customs Enforcement helicopter patrols the airspace over New York City  Main article  USA PATRIOT Act Further information  Detentions following the 11 September attacks and Aftermath of the 11 September attacks In addition to military efforts abroad  in the aftermath of 9 11 the Bush Administration increased domestic efforts to prevent future attacks  Various government bureaucracies which handled security and military functions were reorganized  A new cabinet level agency called the United States Department of Homeland Security was created in November 2002 to lead and coordinate the largest reorganization of the US federal government since the consolidation of the armed forces into the Department of Defense  citation needed  The Justice Department launched a Special Registration procedure for certain male non citizens in the US  requiring them to register in person at offices of the Immigration and Naturalization Service  The USA PATRIOT Act of October 2001 dramatically reduces restrictions on law enforcement agencies  ability to search telephone  e mail communications  medical  financial  and other records  eases restrictions on foreign intelligence gathering within the United States  expands the Secretary of the Treasury s authority to regulate financial transactions  particularly those involving foreign individuals and entities  and broadens the discretion of law enforcement and immigration authorities in detaining and deporting immigrants suspected of terrorism related acts  The act also expanded the definition of terrorism to include domestic terrorism  thus enlarging the number of activities to which the USA PATRIOT Act s expanded law enforcement powers could be applied  A new Terrorist Finance Tracking Program monitored the movements of terrorists  financial resources  discontinued after being revealed by The New York Times newspaper   Telecommunication usage by known and suspected terrorists was studied through the NSA electronic surveillance program  The Patriot Act is still in effect  Political interest groups have stated that these laws remove important restrictions on governmental authority  and are a dangerous encroachment on civil liberties  possible unconstitutional violations of the Fourth Amendment  On 30 July 2003  the American Civil Liberties Union  ACLU  filed the first legal challenge against Section 215 of the Patriot Act  claiming that it allows the FBI to violate a citizen s First Amendment rights  Fourth Amendment rights  and right to due process  by granting the government the right to search a person s business  bookstore  and library records in a terrorist investigation  without disclosing to the individual that records were being searched  89  Also  governing bodies in a number of communities have passed symbolic resolutions against the act  In a speech on 9 June 2005  Bush said that the USA PATRIOT Act had been used to bring charges against more than 400 suspects  more than half of whom had been convicted  Meanwhile the ACLU quoted Justice Department figures showing that 7 000 people have complained of abuse of the Act  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA  began an initiative in early 2002 with the creation of the Total Information Awareness program  designed to promote information technologies that could be used in counter terrorism  This program  facing criticism  has since been defunded by Congress  By 2003  12 major conventions and protocols were designed to combat terrorism  These were adopted and ratified by a number of states  These conventions require states to co operate on principal issues regarding unlawful seizure of aircraft  the physical protection of nuclear materials  and the freezing of assets of militant networks  90  In 2005  the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1624 concerning incitement to commit acts of terrorism and the obligations of countries to comply with international human rights laws  91  Although both resolutions require mandatory annual reports on counter terrorism activities by adopting nations  the United States and Israel have both declined to submit reports  In the same year  the United States Department of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a planning document  by the name  National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism  which stated that it constituted the  comprehensive military plan to prosecute the Global War on Terror for the Armed Forces of the United States   including the findings and recommendations of the 9 11 Commission and a rigorous examination with the Department of Defense   On 9 January 2007  the House of Representatives passed a bill  by a vote of 299 128  enacting many of the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission The bill passed in the US Senate  92  by a vote of 60 38  on 13 March 2007 and it was signed into law on 3 August 2007 by President Bush  It became Public Law 110 53  The Office of Strategic Influence was secretly created after 9 11 for the purpose of coordinating propaganda efforts  but was closed soon after being discovered  The Bush administration implemented the Continuity of Operations Plan  or Continuity of Government  to ensure that US government would be able to continue in catastrophic circumstances  Since 9 11  extremists made various attempts to attack the US homeland  with varying levels of organization and skill  For example  vigilant passengers aboard a transatlantic flight prevented Richard Reid  in 2001  and Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab  in 2009  from detonating an explosive device  Other terrorist plots have been stopped by federal agencies using new legal powers and investigative tools  sometimes in cooperation with foreign governments  Such thwarted attacks include  The 2001 shoe bomb plot A plan to crash airplanes into the US Bank Tower  aka Library Tower  in Los Angeles The 2003 plot by Iyman Faris to blow up the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City The 2004 Financial buildings plot which targeted the International Monetary Fund and World Bank buildings in Washington  DC  the New York Stock Exchange and other financial institutions The 2004 Columbus Shopping Mall Bombing Plot The 2006 Sears Tower plot The 2007 Fort Dix attack plot The 2007 John F  Kennedy International Airport attack plot The New York Subway Bombing Plot and 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt The Obama administration has promised the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp  increased the number of troops in Afghanistan  and promised the withdrawal of its troops from Iraq  Casualties The Global War of Terror has seen fewer war deaths than any other decade in the past century  93  There is no widely agreed on figure for the number of people that have been killed so far in the War on Terror as it has been defined by the Bush Administration to include the war in Afghanistan  the war in Iraq  and operations elsewhere  Some estimates include the following  Iraq  62 570 to 1 124 000 Main article  Casualties of the Iraq War Opinion Research Business  ORB  poll conducted 12 19 August 2007 estimated 1 033 000 violent deaths due to the Iraq War  The range given was 946 000 to 1 120 000 deaths  A nationally representative sample of approximately 2 000 Iraqi adults answered whether any members of their household  living under their roof  were killed due to the Iraq War  22  of the respondents had lost one or more household members  ORB reported that  48  died from a gunshot wound  20  from the impact of a car bomb  9  from aerial bombardment  6  as a result of an accident and 6  from another blast ordnance   94  95  96  97  Between 392 979 and 942 636 estimated Iraqi  655 000 with a confidence interval of 95    civilian and combatant  according to the second Lancet survey of mortality  A minimum of 62 570 civilian deaths reported in the mass media up to 28 April 2007 according to Iraq Body Count project  98  4410 US military dead  31 844 wounded in action  of which 13 954 were unable to return to duty within 72 hours  99  Afghanistan  between 10 960 and 49 600 Main article  Civilian casualties of the War in Afghanistan  2001 present  According to Marc W  Herold s extensive database  100  between 3 100 and 3 600 civilians were directly killed by US Operation Enduring Freedom bombing and Special Forces attacks between 7 October 2001 and 3 June 2003  This estimate counts only  impact deaths  deaths that occurred in the immediate aftermath of an explosion or shooting and does not count deaths that occurred later as a result of injuries sustained  or deaths that occurred as an indirect consequence of the US airstrikes and invasion  In an opinion article published in August 2002 in the magazine The Weekly Standard  Joshua Muravchik of the American Enterprise Institute  101  questioned Professor Herold s study entirely on the basis of one single incident that involved 25 93 deaths  He did not provide any estimate his own  102  In a pair of January 2002 studies  Carl Conetta of the Project on Defense Alternatives estimates that  at least  4 200 4 500 civilians were killed by mid January 2002 as a result of the US war and airstrikes  both directly as casualties of the aerial bombing campaign  and indirectly in the resulting humanitarian crisis  His first study   Operation Enduring Freedom  Why a Higher Rate of Civilian Bombing Casualties    103  released 18 January 2002  estimates that  at the low end   at least  1 000 1 300 civilians were directly killed in the aerial bombing campaign in just the 3 months between 7 October 2001 to 1 January 2002  The author found it impossible to provide an upper end estimate to direct civilian casualties from the Operation Enduring Freedom bombing campaign that he noted as having an increased use of cluster bombs  104  In this lower end estimate  only Western press sources were used for hard numbers  while heavy  reduction factors  were applied to Afghan government reports so that their estimates were reduced by as much as 75   105  In his companion study   Strange Victory  A critical appraisal of Operation Enduring Freedom and the Afghanistan war   106  released 30 January 2002  Conetta estimates that  at least  3 200 more Afghans died by mid January 2002  of  starvation  exposure  associated illnesses  or injury sustained while in flight from war zones   as a result of the US war and airstrikes  In similar numbers  a Los Angeles Times review of US  British  and Pakistani newspapers and international wire services found that between 1 067 and 1 201 direct civilian deaths were reported by those news organizations during the five months from 7 October 2001 to 28 February 2002  This review excluded all civilian deaths in Afghanistan that did not get reported by US  British  or Pakistani news  excluded 497 deaths that did get reported in US  British  and Pakistani news but that were not specifically identified as civilian or military  and excluded 754 civilian deaths that were reported by the Taliban but not independently confirmed  107  According to Jonathan Steele of The Guardian between 20 000 and 49 600 people may have died of the consequences of the invasion by the spring of 2002  108  Pakistan  between 1467 and 2334 killed in U S  drone attacks as of 6 May 2011 Main articles  Drone attacks in Pakistan and Terrorism in

million displaced from homes in Mogadishu alone during the year 2007  110  USA Two radicals  John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo  conducted sniper attacks in Washington  D C   Maryland  and

outlays that have been made for the conflicts during this nearly decade long period  The report focuses on expenditures related to Operation Enduring Freedom  OEF  Afghanistan and other counter terror operations  Operation Noble Eagle  ONE   providing enhanced security at military bases  and Operation Iraqi Freedom  OIF   The report s total does not include supplementary economic  food and military aid to Pakistan or assistance to several countries in Africa  The report states that the price tag through fiscal year 2011 for such purposes as military operations  base security  reconstruction  foreign aid  embassy costs  and veterans  health care will be  1 283 trillion  If the fiscal year budget for 2012 is approved  the total global security and conflict related costs will be  1 415 trillion  If deployed troop levels come down to 45 000 by 2015 and stay there through 2021  the total two decade cost is estimated to be  1 8 trillion  121  Criticism Main article  Criticism of the War on Terror Participants in a rally  dressed as hooded detainees  Criticism of the War on Terror addresses the issues  morals  ethics  efficiency  economics  and other questions surrounding the War on Terror and made against the phrase itself  calling it a misnomer  The notion of a  war  against  terrorism  has proven highly contentious  with critics charging that it has been exploited by participating governments to pursue long standing policy   military objectives  122  reduce civil liberties  123  and infringe upon human rights  It is argued that the term war is not appropriate in this context  as in War on Drugs   since there is no identifiable enemy  and that it is unlikely international terrorism can be brought to an end by military means  124  Other critics  such as Francis Fukuyama  note that  terrorism  is not an enemy  but a tactic  calling it a  war on terror   obscures differences between conflicts such as anti occupation insurgents and international mujahideen  With a military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan and its associated collateral damage Shirley Williams maintains this increases resentment and terrorist threats against the west  125  There is also perceived U S  hypocrisy  126  media induced hysteria  127  and that differences in foreign and security policy have reduced America s image in most of the world  128  See also Terrorism portal War
