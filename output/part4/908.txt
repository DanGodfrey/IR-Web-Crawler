Stryker orchestrated the attack on the President and has been experimenting on mutants  using a drug injected directly into the back of the neck to control them  Jean reads Nightcrawler s mind and determines that Stryker s base is located at Alkali Lake  inside the dam where he plans to kill the world s mutants by building a second Cerebro  Through his son  Jason  Stryker gains control over the

Xavier  Cyclops  and Wolverine talking about Jean s past  They are then interrupted by Colossus and a large number of the students who are supposed to be in their next class  While they leave

as Colonel William Stryker  A human military scientist who plans a worldwide genocide of mutants using Xavier and Cerebro  Stryker has experimented on mutants in the past  including Wolverine  and uses a serum to control them  Singer opted to cast Cox in the role as he was a fan of his performance as Hannibal Lecktor in Manhunter  4  Alan Cumming as Kurt Wagner   Nightcrawler  A kindly German mutant with a strong Catholic faith  yet ironically he has the appearance of a blue demon  Nightcrawler was used by Stryker in an assassination attempt on the President of the United States and gives help to the X Men  He is capable of teleporting himself  and others  instantly from one location to another  On his body are many scarification marks  one for every sin  Cumming had always been Singer s choice for the role  but Cumming could not accept the part due to scheduling conflicts  5 Ethan Embry had been reported to be in contention for the role  6  but the film labored in development long enough for Cumming to accept the part  5  Singer also felt comfortable in casting Cumming since he is fluent in the German language  7  The drawings of Adam Kubert were used as inspiration for Nightcrawler s makeup design  8  which took four hours to apply  9  For the scene where Nightcrawler has his shirt off  Cumming went through nine hours  5  To best pose as Nightcrawler  Cumming studied comic books and illustrations of the character  9  Aaron Stanford as John Allerdyce   Pyro  A friend of Bobby and Rogue  Pyro has anti social tendencies because is very angry at humans for how

until his mother committed suicide  His father lobotomized him and uses a fluid from his brain to control mutants  Xavier s mind is too strong for the fluid  however  and Jason is instead used in order to manipulate him in Stryker s genocidal scheme  Although the character of Senator Robert Kelly was killed in the first film  Bruce Davison reprised the role for scenes where Mystique uses his persona to infiltrate the government  In other cameos  Katie Stuart appeared as Kitty Pryde  a girl who can walk through walls  Bryce Hodgson as Artie  Kea Wong as Jubilee and Shauna Kain as Siryn  who is able to emit loud screams that alert the students to Stryker s attack  Also in the final scene with Xavier  a girl is seen dressed in a Native American style jacket  as well as a blond haired boy dressed in blue  played by Layke Anderson  These were confirmed to be Danielle Moonstar and Douglas Ramsey  10 Daniel Cudmore appeared as Peter Rasputin   Colossus  Cudmore was set to use a Russian accent  but Singer dropped the idea for unknown reasons  and onset rewrites minimized the character s importance to a cameo  11  Jubilee  Psylocke and Multiple Man were to have cameos for the scene when Stryker and his troops storm the X Mansion  Beast  Gambit and Marrow were to have appearances during the Dark Cerebro sequence  Gambit s cameo was actually shot  but the footage was not used in the final cut  Beast s scene was to show Dr  Hank McCoy transforming into his notable blue fur while Marrow was to be seen lying on a ground in New York City  10  Hank McCoy appears on a television during the scene where Mystique drugs Magneto s prison guard  Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris  the film s writers  cameo in scenes of Wolverine s Weapon X flashbacks as surgeons  12 Shaquille O Neal wanted a role in the film but was ignored by the filmmakers  13   edit  Development  edit  Writing The financial and critical success of X Men persuaded 20th Century Fox to commission a sequel instantly  Starting in November 2000  14 Bryan Singer researched various storylines  one of them being the Legacy Virus  of the X Men comic book series  choosing God Loves  Man Kills as the premise  15  Singer wanted to study   the human perspective  the kind of blind rage that feeds into warmongering and terrorism   16  citing a need for a  human villain   14  Singer and producer Tom DeSanto envisioned X2  X Men United as the film series  Empire Strikes Back  in that the characters are  all split apart  and then dissected  and revelations occur that are significant    the romance comes to fruition and a lot of things happen   17  Producer Avi Arad announced a planned November 2002 theatrical release date  18  while David Hayter and Zak Penn were hired to write separate scripts  19  Hayter and Penn combined what they felt to be the best elements of both scripts into one screenplay  20  Singer and Hayter worked on another script  finishing in October 2001  21  Concept art of the Danger Room before the setpiece was stored due to budgetary concerns Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris were hired to rewrite Hayter and Penn s script in February 2002  22  turning down the opportunity to write Urban Legends  Bloody Mary  23 Angel and Beast appeared in early drafts  but were deleted because there were too many characters  Dr  Hank McCoy  however  can be seen on a television interview in one scene  Beast s appearance was to resemble Jim Lee s 1991 artwork of the character in the series X Men  Legacy  8  Angel was to have been a mutant experiment by William Stryker  transforming into Archangel  10  A reference to Dougherty s and Harris  efforts of Angel remains in the form of an X ray on display in one of Stryker s labs  15 Tyler Mane was to reprise as Sabretooth before the character was deleted  24  In Hayter s script  the role eventually filled by Lady Deathstrike was Anne Reynolds  a character who appeared in God Loves  Man Kills as Stryker s personal assistant assassin  Singer changed her to Deathstrike  citing a need for  another kick ass mutant   14  There was to be more development on Cyclops and Professor X being brainwashed by Stryker  The scenes were shot  but Fox cut them out because of time length and story complications  Hayter was disappointed  feeling that James Marsden deserved more screentime  10  Rewrites were commissioned once more  specifically to give Halle Berry more screentime  This was because of her recent popularity in Monster s Ball  earning her the Academy Award for Best Actress  25  A budget cut meant that the Sentinels 15  and the Danger Room were dropped  Guy Hendrix Dyas and a production crew had already constructed the Danger Room set  In the words of Dyas   The control room  of the danger room  was a large propeller that actually rotated around the room so that you can sit up  in that control room  and travel around the subject who is in the middle of the control room  The idea for the traveling is that if it s a mutant has some kind of mind control powers they can t connect   9  Dyas and sculptor James Jones merged several Sentinel designs into a final maquette of an almost hollow robot who could compress into a disk shape  Animating the Sentinel would have cost  7 million  26   edit  Production Producer Lauren Shuler Donner had hoped to start filming in March 2002  19  but production did not begin until June 17  2002 in Vancouver and ended by November  27  Over sixty four sets were used in thirty eight different locations  9  The film crew encountered problems when not enough snow was produced in Kananaskis  Alberta  An excessive amount of fake snow was then applied  28  The idea to have Jean Grey sacrifice herself at the end and to be resurrected in a third installment was highly secretive  Singer did not tell Famke Janssen until midway through filming  29  Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel and two stunt drivers nearly died when filming the scene in which Pyro has a dispute with police officers  4  John Ottman composed the score  30  Ottman established a new title theme  as well as themes specifically for Magneto  Jean Grey  Nightcrawler  Mystique and Pyro   edit  Design and effects Nightcrawler s tail was mainly computer generated  although Alan Cumming sometimes used one made of rubber  4  Singer and Sigel credited Road to Perdition as a visual influence  Though Sigel shot the first X Men in the anamorphic format  he opted to shoot X2 in Super 35  Sigel felt the recent improvements in film stocks and optics increased the advantages of using spherical lenses  even if the blowup to anamorphic must be accomplished optically instead of digitally  Sigel noted   If you think about it  every anamorphic lens is simply a spherical lens with an anamorphizer on it  They ll never be as good as the spherical lenses that they emulate   31  Cameras that were used during filming included two Panaflex Millenniums and a Millennium XL  as well as an Aaton 35mm  Singer also used zoom lenses more often than he did in his previous films  while Sigel used a Frazier lens specifically for dramatic moments  31  The Blackbird was redesigned and increased in virtual size from 60 feet to 85 feet  9 John Myhre served as the production designer on the first film  but Singer hired Guy Hendrix Dyas for X2  which was his first film as a production designer  32  For scenes involving Stryker s Alkali Base  Vancouver Film Studios  the largest sound stage in North America  was reserved  8  Visual effects supervisor Mike Fink was not satisfied with his work on the previous film  despite the fact it nearly received an Academy Award nomination  Up to 520 shots were created for X Men  while X2 commissioned roughly 800  A new computer program was created by Rhythm and Hues for the dogfight tornado scene  Cinesite was in charge of scenes concerning Cerebro  enlisting a 20 man crew  The Alkali Lake Dam miniature was 25 ft  7 6 m  high and 28 ft  8 5 m  wide  33  Cinesite created 300 visual effects shots  focusing on character animation  while Rhythm and Hues created over 100  34   edit  Comic book references One scene depicts Mystique going through files on Yuriko s computer  Bryan Singer purposely included various characters and hints of storylines in the X Men comic book on Yuriko s computer screen  Singer  finds great difficulty in adapting all this stuff into a two and a half hour long movie   4  Among the files are dossiers on Gambit  Cannonball  Husk  Silver Samurai  Garrison Kane  Magneto  Artie Maddicks  Multiple Man  Karma  Quicksilver  Scarlet Witch  Proteus  Danielle Moonstar  Storm  Beast  Feral  Banshee  Black Tom Cassidy  Lila Cheney  Sabretooth  Sunspot  Polaris  Psylocke  Iceman  Blob  Skin and Wild Child  There are also folders seen on the desk  including Omega Red  Project Wideawake  Franklin Richards and Cerebro  Closer inspection reveals that Stryker is keeping files on Pyro  Sabra

earning  107 million in its first five days of DVD release  29  X2 had a video game tie in on X2  Wolverine s Revenge  which has nothing to do with the events of the film  although Patrick Stewart voiced Professor X  X Men  The Official Game bridges the storyline between X2 and X Men  The Last Stand  Specifically  it explains Nightcrawler s absence from The Last Stand  Chris Claremont wrote a novelization of the film  which left out its secretive cliffhanger  39   edit  Critical response The film received very positive reviews  Based on 222 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes  X2 received

handle so many characters in one film  In addition  Ebert wrote that the film s closing was perfect for a future installment  giving X2 three out of four stars  43 Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles

was better than usual  for a superhero film    44 Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that Hugh Jackman heavily improved his performance  concluding  X2 is a summer firecracker  It s also a tribute to outcasts  teens  gays  minorities  even Dixie Chicks   45  Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle was critical of the storyline  special effects and action scenes  46 Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal specifically referred to the film as  fast paced  slow witted   47 Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post wrote  Of the many comic book superhero movies  this is by far the lamest  the loudest  the longest   48 Richard Corliss of Time argued that Singer depended too much on seriousness and that he did not have enough sensibilities to communicate to an audience  49 Empire called X2 the best comic book movie of all time in 2006  50  while Wizard named the film s ending as the twenty second greatest cliffhanger of all time  51  In May 2007  Rotten Tomatoes listed X2 as the
