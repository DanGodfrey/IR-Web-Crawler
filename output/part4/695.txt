former Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic  3  South Ossetians declared independence from Georgia in 1990  calling themselves the Republic of South Ossetia  The Georgian government responded by abolishing South Ossetia s autonomy and trying to retake the region by force  4  This led to the 1991 1992 South Ossetia War  5  Georgian fighting against those controlling South Ossetia occurred on two other occasions  in 2004 and 2008  6  The last conflict led to the 2008 South Ossetia war  during which Ossetian and Russian forces gained full  de facto control of the territory of the former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast  In the wake of the 2008 South Ossetia War  Russia  Nicaragua  Venezuela  Nauru  and Tuvalu recognized South Ossetia as an independent republic  7  8  9  10  11  Georgia does not recognize the existence of South Ossetia as a political entity  and considers most of its territory a part of the Shida Kartli region under Georgian sovereignty  occupied by the

believed to originate from the Alans  a Sarmatian tribe  They became Christian during the early Middle Ages  under the Byzantine and Georgian influences  Under Mongol rule  they were pushed out of their medieval homeland south of the Don River in present day Russia and part migrated towards and over the Caucasus mountains  into the kingdom of Georgia and into the lands of present day North Ossetia Alania   13  where they formed three distinct territorial entities  Digor in the west came under the influence of the neighboring Kabardins  who introduced Islam  Kudar in the south became what is now South Ossetia  part of the historical Georgian principality of Samachablo 14  where Ossetians found refuge from Mongol invaders  Ir n in the north became what is now North Ossetia  under Russian rule from 1767  The vast majority of the Ossetians are Orthodox Christians  there is also a significant Muslim minority   edit  South Ossetia as a part of the Soviet Union The territory that is now modern day South Ossetia joined Russia in 1801  along with Georgia proper  and absorbed into the Russian Empire  Following the Russian Revolution  South Ossetia became a part of the Menshevik Georgian Democratic Republic  while North Ossetia became a part of the Terek Soviet Republic   The Georgian Menshevik government accused Ossetians of cooperating with Russian Bolsheviks  A series of Ossetian rebellions took place between 1918 and 1920 during which claims were made to an independent territory  Violence broke out in 1920 when Georgian Mensheviks sent National Guards and regular army units to Tskhinvali to crush the uprisings  Ossetian sources claim that about 5 000 Ossetians were killed and more than 13 000 subsequently died from hunger and epidemics   15  The Soviet Georgian government established after the Red Army invasion of Georgia in 1921 created the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast in April 1922  Although the Ossetians had their own language  Ossetian   Russian and Georgian were administrative state languages  16  Under the rule of Georgia s government during Soviet times  it enjoyed partial autonomy  including speaking the Ossetian language and teaching it in schools  16   edit  Georgian Ossetian conflict Main article  Georgian Ossetian conflict  edit  1989 2008 Map of South Ossetia  November 2004 Hatched shading shows Georgian controlled areas in South Ossetia in June 2007  according to JPKF  17  The monument to the victims of the Georgian Ossetian conflict in Tskhinvali  in 2003  The tensions in the region began to rise amid the rising nationalism among both Georgians and Ossetians in 1989  Before this  the two communities of the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast of the Georgian SSR had been living in peace with each other except for the 1918 1920 events  Both ethnicities have had a high level of interaction and high rates of intermarriages  18  The influential South Ossetian Popular Front  Ademon Nykhas  was created in 1988  On 10 November 1989  the South Ossetian regional council asked the Georgian Supreme Council  in Russian                          for the region to be upgraded to that of  autonomous republic   In 1989  the Georgian Supreme Council established Georgian as the principal language countrywide  15  The Georgian Supreme Council adopted a law barring regional parties in summer 1990  This was interpreted by Ossetians as a move against Ademon Nykhas and led to Ossetians proclaiming South Ossetia as the South Ossetian Democratic Republic on September 20  1990  19  20  fully sovereign within the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  USSR   Ossetians boycotted subsequent Georgian parliamentary elections and held their own contest in December  The Georgian government headed by Zviad Gamsakhurdia declared this election illegitimate and abolished South Ossetia s autonomous status altogether on 11 December 1990  15  Violent conflict broke out towards the end of 1990  Russian and Georgian interior ministry troops were dispatched to South Ossetia in December  with war starting on January 5  1991  when Georgian troops entered Tskhinvali  21  The fighting was characterised by general disregard for international humanitarian law by uncontrollable militias  with both sides reporting atrocities  21  During the war  many South Ossetian villages were attacked and burned  as were Georgian houses and schools in Tskhinvali  the capital of South Ossetia  As a result  approximately 1 000 died and about 100 000 ethnic Ossetians fled the territory and Georgia proper  most across the border into North Ossetia  A further 23 000 ethnic Georgians fled South Ossetia and settled in other parts of Georgia  22  Many South Ossetians were resettled in uninhabited areas of North Ossetia from which the Ingush had been expelled by Stalin in 1944  leading to conflicts between Ossetians and Ingush over the right of residence in former Ingush territory  The western part of South Ossetia was affected by the 1991 Racha Java earthquake  which killed 200 and left 300 families homeless  In 1992  Georgia accepted a ceasefire to avoid a large scale confrontation with Russia  The government of Georgia and South Ossetian separatists reached an agreement to avoid the use of force against one another  and Georgia pledged not to impose sanctions against South Ossetia  However  the Georgian government still retained control over substantial portions of South Ossetia  including the town of Akhalgori  23  A peacekeeping force of Ossetians  Russians and Georgians was established  On 6 November 1992  the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  OSCE  set up a mission in Georgia to monitor the peacekeeping operation  From then until mid 2004 South Ossetia was generally peaceful  In June 2004  serious tensions began to rise as the Georgian authorities strengthened their efforts to bring the region back under Tbilisi rule  by establishing an alternative pro Georgian government for South Ossetia in Tbilisi  Georgia also sent police to close down a vast black market complex  which was one of the region s chief sources of revenue  leading to fighting by Georgian troops and peacekeepers against South Ossetian militiamen and freelance fighters from Russia  24  25  Hostage takings  shootouts and occasional bombings left dozens dead and wounded  A ceasefire deal was reached on 13 August though it was repeatedly violated  The Georgian government protested against the continually increasing Russian economic and political presence in the region and against the uncontrolled military of the South Ossetian side  It also considered the peacekeeping force  consisting in equal parts of South Ossetians  North Ossetians  Russians and Georgians  to be non neutral and demanded its replacement  26  27  This criticism was supported by the U S  senator Richard Lugar  28  EU South Caucasus envoy Peter Semneby said later that  Russia s actions in the Georgia spy row have damaged its credibility as a neutral peacekeeper in the EU s Black Sea neighbourhood   29  Later  Joseph Biden  Chairman  U S  Senate Foreign Relations Committee   Richard Lugar  and Mel Martinez sponsored a resolution accusing Russia of attempting to undermine Georgia s territorial integrity and called for replacing the Russian manned peacekeeping force operating under CIS mandate  30   edit  2008 War Main article  2008 South Ossetia war August 2008  Tskhinvali after Georgian attack  The sign reads  Secondary school  6   The prelude to the conflict began with violent clashes on Wednesday  6 August 2008 with both sides claiming having been fired upon by the other  Separatist authorities in South Ossetia said that Georgia shelled South Ossetian villages  killing six Ossetians  31  32  The Georgian interior ministry claimed Georgian forces had returned fire only after South Ossetian positions shelled Georgian controlled villages injuring six civilians and one Georgian policeman  The Georgian interior ministry accused the South Ossetian side of  trying to create an illusion of serious escalation  an illusion of war   In addition  the commander of the Georgian peacekeeping unit  General Kurashvili  accused the Russian peacekeepers of participating in the shelling of the Georgian villages  33  South Ossetia denied provoking the conflict  34  35  According to Moscow Defense Brief  over the course of several days in early August  the Georgians concentrated a significant number of troops and equipment  including the full 2nd  3rd and 4th Infantry Brigades  the Artillery Brigade  the elements of the 1st Infantry Brigade  the separate Gori Tank Battalion  among others   all in all  up to 16 000 men   in the Georgian enclaves in the South Ossetian conflict zone  under cover of providing support for the exchange of fire with Ossetian formations   36 International Institute for Strategic Studies and Western intelligence experts give a lower estimate  saying that the Georgians had amassed about 12 000 troops and 75 tanks on the South Ossetian border by 7 August  37  On 7 August  Georgian and Ossetian forces agreed on a ceasefire  38  However  in the first hours of 8 August 2008  Georgia launched a massive attack  According to a report prepared by the Georgian government  the Georgian army acted after a large number of Russian troops and around 150 armored vehicles and trucks entered the South Ossetia territory through the Roki tunnel on the night of August 7  Allegedly the Russian military and Ossetian militia started a heavy artillery bombardment of the Georgian populated village Tamarasheni located on the outskirts of Tskhinvali at 9pm on August 7  39  However  an OSCE monitoring group in Tskhinvali did not record outgoing artillery fire from the South Ossetian side in the hours before the start of Georgian bombardment  and NATO officials attest to minor skirmishes but nothing that amounted to a provocation  according to Der Spiegel  40  Georgia s claim that it responded to a large scale Russian invasion has received little support from Georgia s allies  the US and NATO  41  The accounts of who started the war remains contradictory  Erosi Kitsmarishvili  Georgia s former ambassador to Moscow and a confidant of President Mikheil Saakashvili  in his testimony to the Parliament of Georgia said that Georgian government was preparing to start the war in South Ossetia  42  After a prolonged artillery attack  Georgian troops with tanks and air support entered South Ossetian controlled territory  43  44  45  On the same day  twelve Russian peacekeepers were killed and nearly 150 injured  46  Heavy fighting was reported in Tskhinvali for most of 8 August  with Georgian forces attempting to push Ossetians slowly from the city  47  The following day  Russia deployed forces into South Ossetia to remove Georgian forces from South Ossetia  Additionally  Russia targeted Georgia s military infrastructure to reduce Georgia s ability to conduct another incursion  Russian troops and the South Ossetians pushed the Georgian army out of South Ossetia and moved farther  occupying Gori  Kareli  Kaspi and Igoeti in Georgia proper  Parallel to these events Russian forces also entered western Georgia from another breakaway region of Abkhazia occupying Zugdidi  Senaki and the major Georgian port of Poti  Following an EU sponsored cease fire between Georgia and Russia  Russia pulled its forces back to Russia and South Ossetia  finishing the withdrawal by 8 October  The war left mostly Ossetian city Tskhinvali in ruins  ethnic Georgian villages burnt and razed to the ground  leaving 24 000 Ossetians and 15 000 ethnic Georgians displaced  according to an Amnesty International report  48  49   edit  Geography Relief of South Ossetia  South Ossetia covers an area of about 3 900 km2  1 506 sq mi  50  on the southern side of the Caucasus  separated by the mountains from the more populous North Ossetia  part of Russia  and extending southwards almost to the Mtkvari river in Georgia  It is extremely mountainous  with most of the region lying over 1 000 m  3 281 ft  above sea level  and its highest point is the Mount Khalatsa  at 3 938 m  12 920 ft  above sea level  Its economy is primarily agricultural  although less than 10  of South Ossetia s land area is cultivated  Cereals  fruit and vines are the major produce  Forestry and cattle industries are also maintained  A number of industrial facilities also exist  particularly around the capital  Tskhinvali   edit  Political status Main article  International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia Main article  Foreign relations of South Ossetia The European Union  Council of Europe  North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO  and most UN member countries do not recognize South Ossetia as an independent state  The de facto republic governed by the secessionist government held a second independence referendum 51  on 12 November 2006  after its first referendum in 1992 was not recognized by most governments as valid  52  According to the Tskhinvali election authorities  the referendum turned out a majority for independence from Georgia where 99  of South Ossetian voters supported independence and the turnout for the vote was 95   53  The referendum was monitored by a team of 34 international observers from Germany  Austria  Poland  Sweden and other countries at 78 polling stations  54  However  it was not recognized internationally by the UN  European Union  OSCE  NATO and the Russian Federation  given the lack of ethnic Georgian participation and the legality of such a referendum without recognition from the Georgian government in Tbilisi  55  The European Union  OSCE and NATO condemned the referendum  Parallel to the secessionist held referendum and elections  to Eduard Kokoity  the current President of South Ossetia  the Ossetian opposition movement  People of South Ossetia for Peace  organized their own elections in contemporaneously Georgian controlled areas within South Ossetia  in which Georgian and some Ossetian inhabitants of the region voted in favour of Dmitry Sanakoyev as the alternative President of South Ossetia  56  The alternative elections of Sanakoyev claimed full support of the ethnic Georgian population  citation needed  In April 2007  Georgia created the Provisional Administrative Entity of South Ossetia 57  58  59  60  and staffed by ethnic Ossetian members of the separatist movement  Dmitry Sanakoyev was assigned as the leader of the Entity  It was intended that this provisional administration would negotiate with central Georgian authorities regarding its final status and conflict resolution  61  On 10 May 2007  Sanakoyev was appointed by the President of Georgia as the Head of South Ossetian Provisional Administrative Entity  On July 13  2007  Georgia set up a state commission  chaired by the Prime Minister Zurab Noghaideli  to develop South Ossetia s autonomous status within the Georgian state  According to the Georgian officials  the status was to be elaborated within the framework of  an all inclusive dialogue  with all the forces and communities within the Ossetian society  62  Russian Presidential Decree No  1261 recognising South Ossetian independence Following the 2008 South Ossetia war  Russia recognized South Ossetia as independent  63  This unilateral recognition by Russia was met by condemnation from Western Blocs  such as NATO  OSCE and the European Council due to the violation of Georgia s territorial integrity  64  65  66  67  The EU s diplomatic response to the news was delayed by disagreements between Eastern European states and the UK wanting a harsher response and Germany  France  and other states  desire not to isolate Russia  68  Former US envoy Richard Holbrooke said the conflict could encourage separatist movements in other former Soviet states along Russia s western border  69  Several days later  Nicaragua became the second country to recognize South Ossetia  63 Venezuela recognised South Ossetia on September 10  2009  becoming the third UN member state to do so  70  On August 30  2008  Tarzan Kokoity  the Deputy Speaker of South Ossetia s parliament  announced that the region would soon be absorbed into Russia  so that South and North Ossetians could live together in one united Russian state  71  Russian and South Ossetian forces began giving residents in Akhalgori  the biggest town in the predominantly ethnic Georgian eastern part of South Ossetia  the choice of accepting Russian citizenship or leaving  72  However  Eduard Kokoity  the current president of South Ossetia  later stated that South Ossetia would not forgo its independence by joining Russia   We are not going to say no to our independence  which has been achieved at the expense of many lives  South Ossetia has no plans to join Russia   Civil Georgia has said that this statement contradicts previous ones made by Kokoity earlier that day  when he indicated that South Ossetia would join North Ossetia in the Russian Federation  71  73  During the opening ceremony of a new building of the Georgian Embassy in Kiev  Ukraine  in November 2009 Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili stated that residents of South Ossetia and Abkhazia could also use its facilities  I would like to assure you  my dear friends  that this is your home  as well  and here you will always be able to find support and understanding   74   edit  Law on Occupied Territories of Georgia The neutrality of this section is disputed  Please see the discussion on the talk page  Please do not remove this message until the dispute is resolved   July 2011  Landscape in South Ossetia s Dzhava District  In late October 2008 President Saakashvili signed into law legislation on the occupied territories passed by the Georgian Parliament  The law covers the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali  territories of former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast   75  76  77  The law spells out restrictions on free movement and economic activity in the territories  In particular  according to the law  foreign citizens should enter the two breakaway regions only through Georgia proper  Entry into Abkhazia should be carried out from the Zugdidi District and into South Ossetia from the Gori District  The major road leading to South Ossetia from the rest of Georgia passes through the Gori District  The legislation  however  also lists  special cases  in which entry into the breakaway regions will not be regarded as illegal  It stipulates that  a special permit  on entry into the breakaway regions can be issued if the trip there  serves Georgia s state interests  peaceful resolution of the conflict  de occupation or humanitarian purposes   The law also bans  any type of economic activity   entrepreneurial or non  entrepreneurial   if such activities require permits  licenses or registration in accordance with Georgian legislation  It also bans air  sea and railway communications and international transit via the regions  mineral exploration and money transfers  The provision covering economic activities is retroactive  going back to 1990  The law says that the Russian Federation   the state  which has carried out military occupation    is fully responsible for the violation of human rights in Abkhazia and South Ossetia  The Russian Federation  according to the document  is also responsible for compensation of  material and moral damage inflicted on Georgian citizens  stateless persons and foreign citizens  who are in Georgia and enter the occupied territories with appropriate permits   The law also says that de facto state agencies and officials operating in the occupied territories are regarded as  illegal   The law will remain in force until  the full restoration  of Georgian jurisdiction over the breakaway regions is realised   edit

view talk edit Until the armed conflict of August 2008  South Ossetia consisted of a checkerboard of Georgian inhabited and Ossetian inhabited towns and villages  78  The largely Ossetian capital city of Tskhinvali and most of the other Ossetian inhabited communities were governed by the separatist government  while the Georgian inhabited villages and towns were administered by the Georgian government  This close proximity and the intermixing of the two communities has made the Georgian Ossetian conflict particularly dangerous  since any attempt to create an ethnically pure territory would involve population transfers on a large scale  The political dispute has yet to be resolved and the South Ossetian separatist authorities govern the region with effective independence from Tbilisi  Although talks have been held periodically between the two sides  little progress was made under the government of Eduard Shevardnadze  1993 2003   His successor Mikheil Saakashvili  elected 2004  made the reassertion of Georgian governmental authority a political priority  Having successfully put an end to the de facto independence of the southwestern province of Ajaria in May 2004  he pledged to seek a similar solution in South Ossetia  After the 2004 clashes  the Georgian government has intensified its efforts to bring the problem to international attention  On 25 January 2005  President Saakashvili presented a Georgian vision for resolving the South Ossetian conflict at the PACE session in Strasbourg  Late in October  the US government and the OSCE expressed their support to the Georgian action plan presented by Prime Minister Zurab Noghaideli at the OSCE Permanent Council at Vienna on 27 October 2005  On 6 December  the OSCE Ministerial Council in Ljubljana adopted a resolution supporting the Georgian peace plan 79  which was subsequently rejected by the South Ossetian de facto authorities   edit  Republic of South Ossetia President Eduard Kokoity voting in the 2009 elections  On September 11  2006  the South Ossetian Information and Press Committee announced that the republic would hold an independence referendum 51   the first referendum had not been recognized by the international community as valid in 1992  80  on 12 November 2006  The voters would decide on whether or not South Ossetia  should preserve its present de facto status of an independent state   Georgia denounced the move as a  political absurdity   However  on 13 September 2006  the Council of Europe  CoE  Secretary General Terry Davis commented on the problem  stating that it would be unlikely that anyone would accept the results of this referendum and instead urged South Ossetian government to engage in the negotiations with Georgia  81  On 13 September 2006 European Union Special Representative to the South Caucasus  Peter Semneby  while visiting Moscow  said   results of the South Ossetian independence referendum will have no meaning for the European Union   82  Peter Semneby also added that this referendum would not contribute to the peaceful conflict resolution process in South Ossetia  Ethnic Ossetians and Russians living in South Ossetia nearly unanimously approved a referendum on 12 November 2006 opting for independence from Georgia  The referendum was hugely popular  winning between 98 and 99 percent of the ballots  flag waving and celebration marked were seen across South Ossetia  but elsewhere observers were less enthusiastic  Ethnic Georgians living in South Ossetia boycotted the referendum  International critics claimed that the move could worsen regional tensions  and the Tbilisi government thoroughly discounted the results   Everybody needs to understand  once and for all  that no amount of referenda or elections will move Georgia to give up that which belongs to the Georgian people by God s will   declared Georgi Tsagareishvili  leader of the Industrialist s bloc in Georgia s parliament  83  The People of South Ossetia for Peace was founded in October 2006 by the ethnic Ossetians who were outspoken critics and presented a serious opposition to secessionist authorities of Eduard Kokoity  citation needed  The group headed by the former defence minister and then prime minister of secessionist government Dmitry Sanakoyev organized the so called alternative presidential election  on 12 November 2006  parallel to those held by the secessionist authorities in Tskhinvali  56  High voter turnout was reported by the alternative electoral commission  which estimated over 42 000 voters from both Ossetian  Java district and Tskhinvali  and Georgian  Eredvi  Tamarasheni  etc   communities of South Ossetia and Sanakoyev reportedly received 96  of the votes  Another referendum was organized shortly after asking for the start of negotiations with Georgia on a federal arrangement for South Ossetia received 94  support  However  People of South Ossetia for Peace turned down a request from a Georgian NGO   Multinational Georgia   to monitor it and the released results were very likely to be inflated  24  According to the International Crisis Group   Georgian government s steps are non violent and development oriented but their implementation is unilateral and so assertive that they are contributing to a perceptible and dangerous rise in tensions   24  Initially the entity of Sanakoyev was known as  the Alternative Government of South Ossetia   but during the course of 2007 the central authorities of Georgia decided to give it official status and on 13 April the formation of  Provisional Administration of South Ossetia  was announced  84  On 10 May 2007 Dmitry Sanakoyev was appointed head of the provisional administrative entity in South Ossetia  85  An EU fact finding team visited the region in January 2007  Per Eklund  Head of the Delegation of the European Community to Georgia 5  said that  None of the two alternatives do we consider legitimate  in South Ossetia    86  The republic held its fourth presidential elections in November 2011  Eduard Kokoity was not allowed to run for president for the third time by the constitution  Anatoly Bibilov  supported by Russian authorities and Alla Dzhioeva  backed by main South Ossetian opposition figures  got about a quarter votes each and will participate in the run off vote  87  88   edit  Demographics Palm Sunday procession in Tskhinvali in April  2009 Before the Georgian Ossetian conflict roughly two thirds of the population of South Ossetia was Ossetian and 25 30  was Georgian  The eastern quarter of the country  around the town and district of Akhalgori  is predominantly Georgian  while the center and west are predominantly Ossete  Much of the mountainous north is scarcely inhabited   See map at Languages of the Caucasus   Because the statistical office of Georgia was not able to conduct the 2002 Georgian census in South Ossetia  the present composition of the population of South Ossetia is unknown  89  although according to some estimates there were 47 000 ethnic Ossetians and 17 500 ethnic Georgians in South Ossetia in 2007  90  2009 Population Estimate  During the war  HRW stated that 15 000 Georgians fled and a total of 500 citizens of South Ossetia were killed  91  92  This left the estimated population at 54 500  However Russia s reconstruction plan involving 600 million dollars in aid to South Ossetia may have spurred immigration into the De facto independent Republic  especially with Russia s movement of 3 700 soldiers into South Ossetia  in order to prevent further incursions  93  RIA Novosti places the population of South Ossetia at 80 000 although  this figure is probably too optimistic  93  Ethnicity 1926 census 1939 census 1959 census 1970 census 1979 census

launched in 2009 Following a war with Georgia in the 1990s  South Ossetia struggled economically  South Ossetian GDP was estimated at US  15 million  US  250 per capita  in a work published in 2002  95  Employment and supplies are scarce  Additionally  Georgia cut off supplies of electricity to the region  which forced the South Ossetian government to run an electric cable through North Ossetia  The majority of the population survives on subsistence farming  Virtually the only significant economic asset that South Ossetia possesses is control of the Roki Tunnel that used to link Russia and Georgia  from which the South Ossetian government reportedly obtains as much as a third of its budget by levying customs duties on freight traffic  President Eduard Kokoity has admitted that his country is seriously dependent on Russian economic assistance  96  South Ossetia s poverty threshold stood at 3 062 rubles a month in the fourth quarter of 2007  or 23 5 percent below Russia s average  while South Ossetians have incomparably smaller incomes  97  Before the 2008 South Ossetia war  South Ossetia s industry consisted of 22 small factories  with a total production of 61 6 million rubles in 2006  In 2007  only 7 factories were functioning  In March  2009  it was reported that most of the production facilities were standing idle and were in need of repairs  Even successful factories have a shortage of workers  are in debt and have a shortage of working capital  97  One of the largest local enterprises is the Emalprovod factory  which has 130 employees  97  The South Ossetian authorities are planning to improve finances by boosting the local production of flour and thus reducing the need for flour imports  For this purpose  the area planted with wheat was increased tenfold in 2008 from 130 hectares to 1 500 hectares  The wheat harvest in 2008 was expected to be 2 500 tons of grain  The South Ossetian Agriculture ministry also imported some tractors in 2008  and was expecting delivery of more farm machinery in 2009  97  Russia planned to spend 10 billion rubles in the restoration of South Ossetia in 2009  97  Much of the economy is based around the presence of Russian military forces  98   edit  Culture Kosta Khetagurov  edit  Gallery Pictures from South Ossetia Scenery in central South Ossetia  A South Ossetian woman  South Ossetian performers
