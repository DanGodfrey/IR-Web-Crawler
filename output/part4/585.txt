called the Appalachians  are a system of mountains in eastern North America  The Appalachians first formed roughly 480 million years ago during the Ordovician Period  and were once among the tallest mountains in the world before erosion wore them down  3  The Appalachian chain is a barrier to east west travel as it forms a series of alternating ridgelines and valleys oriented in opposition to any road running east west  Definitions vary on the precise boundaries of the Appalachians  The United States Geological Survey  USGS  defines the Appalachian Highlands physiographic division as consisting of thirteen provinces  the Atlantic Coast Uplands  Eastern Newfoundland Atlantic  Maritime Acadian Highlands  Maritime Plain  Notre Dame and M gantic Mountains  Western Newfoundland Mountains  Piedmont  Blue Ridge  Valley and Ridge  Saint Lawrence Valley  Appalachian Plateaus  New England province  and the Adirondack provinces  4  5  A common variant definition does not include the Adirondack Mountains  which are often said to have more in common with the Canadian Shield than the Appalachians  6  7  8  Contents 1 Overview 1 1 Origin of name 2 Geography 2 1 Regions 2 2 Chief

is mostly located in the United States but extends into southeastern Canada  forming a zone from 100 to 300 mi  160 to 480 km  wide  running from the island of Newfoundland 1 500 mi  2 400 km  south westward to Central Alabama in the United States  The system is divided into a series of ranges  with the individual mountains averaging around 3 000 ft  910 m   The highest of the group is Mount Mitchell in North Carolina at 6 684 feet  2 037 m   which is the highest point in the United States east of the Mississippi River  The term Appalachian refers to several different regions associated with the mountain range  Most broadly  it refers to the entire mountain range with its surrounding hills and the dissected plateau region  However  the term is often used more restrictively to refer to regions in the central and southern Appalachian Mountains  usually including areas in the states of Kentucky  Tennessee  Virginia  Maryland  West Virginia  and North Carolina  as well as sometimes extending as far south as northern Georgia and western South Carolina  as far north as Pennsylvania and southern Ohio  The Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas and Oklahoma were originally part of the Appalachians as well  but became disconnected through geologic history   edit  Origin of name While exploring inland along the northern coast of Florida in 1528  the members of the Narv ez expedition  including  lvar N  ez Cabeza de Vaca  found a Native American village near present day Tallahassee  Florida whose name they transcribed as Apalchen or Apalachen  a pa la t  n   The name was soon altered by the Spanish to Apalachee and used as a name for the tribe and region spreading well inland to the north  P nfilo de Narv ez s expedition first entered Apalachee territory on June 15  1528 and applied the name  Now spelled  Appalachian   it is the fourth oldest surviving European place name in the U S  9  After the de Soto expedition in 1540  Spanish cartographers began to apply the name of the tribe to the mountains themselves  The first cartographic appearance of Apalchen is on Diego Gutierrez  map of 1562  the first use for the mountain range is the map of Jacques le Moyne de Morgues in 1565  10  The name was not commonly used for the whole mountain range until the late 19th century  A competing and often more popular name was the  Allegheny Mountains    Alleghenies   and even  Alleghania   In the early 19th century  Washington Irving proposed renaming the United States either Appalachia or Alleghania  11  In U S  dialects of the southern portions of the Appalachians  the word is pronounced    p  l t  nz   with the third syllable sounding like  latch   In northern parts of the mountain range  it is pronounced    p  le t  nz  or    p  le   nz   the third syllable is like  lay   and the fourth  chins  or  shins   12  Elsewhere  a commonly accepted pronunciation for the adjective Appalachian is    p  l t i n   with the last two syllables   ian  pronounced as in the word  Italian   13   edit  Geography  edit  Regions USGS Appalachian zones in the United States  Shaded relief map of the Cumberland Plateau and Ridge and Valley Appalachians on the Virginia West Virginia border  The whole system may be divided into three great sections  the Northern  from the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador to the Hudson River  the Central  from the Hudson Valley to the New River  Great Kanawha  running through Virginia and West Virginia  and the Southern  from the New River onwards  The northern section includes the Long Range Mountains and Annieopsquotch Mountains on the island of Newfoundland  Chic Choc Mountains and Notre Dame Range in Quebec and New Brunswick  scattered elevations and small ranges elsewhere in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick  the Longfellow Mountains in Maine  the White Mountains in New Hampshire  the Green Mountains in Vermont  and The Berkshires in Massachusetts and Connecticut  The Metacomet Ridge Mountains in Connecticut and south central Massachusetts  although contained within the Appalachian province  is a younger system and not geologically associated with the Appalachians  The central section comprises  excluding various minor groups  the Valley Ridges between the Allegheny Front of the Allegheny Plateau and the Great Appalachian Valley  the New York   New Jersey Highlands  the Taconic Mountains in New York  and a large portion of the Blue Ridge  The southern section consists of the prolongation of the Blue Ridge  which is divided into the Western Blue Ridge  or Unaka  Front and the Eastern Blue Ridge Front  the Ridge and Valley Appalachians  and the Cumberland Plateau  The Adirondack Mountains in New York are sometimes considered part of the Appalachian chain but  geologically speaking  are a southern extension of the Laurentian Mountains of Canada  6  7  8  In addition to the true folded mountains  known as the ridge and valley province  the area of dissected plateau to the north and west of the mountains is usually grouped with the Appalachians  This includes the Catskill Mountains of southeastern New York  the Poconos in Pennsylvania  and the Allegheny Plateau of southwestern New York  western Pennsylvania  eastern Ohio and northern West Virginia  This same plateau is known as the Cumberland Plateau in southern West Virginia  eastern Kentucky  western Virginia  eastern Tennessee  and northern Alabama  The dissected plateau area  while not actually made up of geological mountains  is popularly called  mountains   especially in eastern Kentucky and West Virginia  and while the ridges are not high  the terrain is extremely rugged  In Ohio and New York  some of the plateau has been glaciated  which has rounded off the sharp ridges  and filled the valleys to some extent  The glaciated regions are usually referred to as hill country rather than mountains  The Appalachian region is generally considered the geographical dividing line between the eastern seaboard of the United States and the Midwest region of the country  The Eastern Continental Divide follows the Appalachian Mountains from Pennsylvania to Georgia  The Appalachian Trail is a 2 175 mile  3 500 km  hiking trail that runs all the way from Mount Katahdin in Maine to Springer Mountain in Georgia  passing over or past a large part of the Appalachian system  The International Appalachian Trail is an extension of this hiking trail into the Canadian portion of the Appalachian range   edit  Chief summits The Appalachian belt includes  with the ranges enumerated above  the plateaus sloping southward to the Atlantic Ocean in New England  and south eastward to the border of the coastal plain through the central and southern Atlantic states  and on the north west  the Allegheny and Cumberland plateaus declining toward the Great Lakes and the interior plains  A remarkable feature of the belt is the longitudinal chain of broad valleys  including The Great Appalachian Valley  which in the southerly sections divides the mountain system into two unequal portions  but in the northernmost lies west of all the ranges possessing typical Appalachian features  and separates them from the Adirondack group  The mountain system has no axis of dominating altitudes  but in every portion the summits rise to rather uniform heights  and  especially in the central section  the various ridges and intermontane valleys have the same trend as the system itself  None of the summits reaches the region of perpetual snow  Old fault exposed by roadcut near Harrisburg  Pennsylvania  along Interstate 81  Such faults are common in the folded Appalachians  Mountains of the Long Range in Newfoundland reach heights of nearly 3 000 ft  900 m   In the Chic Choc and Notre Dame mountain ranges in Quebec  the higher summits rise to about 4 000 ft  1 200 m  elevation  Isolated peaks and small ranges in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick vary from 1 000 to 2 700 ft  300 to 800 m   In Maine several peaks exceed 4 000 ft  1 200 m    including Mount Katahdin 5 267 feet  1 605 m   In New Hampshire  many summits rise above 5 000 ft  1 500 m   including Mount Washington in the White Mountains 6 288 ft  1 917 m   Adams 5 771 ft  1 759 m   Jefferson 5 712 ft  1 741 m   Monroe 5 380 ft  1 640 m    Madison 5 367 ft  1 636 m   Lafayette 5 249 feet  1 600 m   and Lincoln 5 089 ft  1 551 m   In the Green Mountains the highest point  Mt  Mansfield  is 4 393 ft  1 339 m  in elevation  others include Killington Peak at 4 226 ft  1 288 m    Camel s Hump at 4 083 ft  1 244 m    Mt  Abraham at 4 006 ft  1 221 m    and a number of other heights exceeding 3 000 ft  900 m   In Pennsylvania  there are over sixty summits that rise over 2 500 ft  800 m   the summits of Mount Davis and Blue Knob rise over 3 000 ft  900 m   In Maryland  Eagle Rock and Dans Mountain are conspicuous points reaching 3 162 ft  964 m  and 2 882 ft  878 m  respectively  On the same side of the Great Valley  south of the Potomac  are the Pinnacle 3 007 feet  917 m  and Pidgeon Roost 3 400 ft  1 000 m   In West Virginia  more than 150 peaks rise above 4 000 ft  1 200 m    including Spruce Knob 4 863 ft  1 482 m   the highest point in the Allegheny Mountains  A number of other points in the state rise above 4 800 ft  1 500 m   Snowshoe Mountain at Thorny Flat 4 848 ft  1 478 m  and Bald Knob 4 842 ft  1 476 m  are among the more notable peaks in West Virginia  Cliffs overlooking the New River near Gauley Bridge  West Virginia  The Blue Ridge Mountains  rising in southern Pennsylvania and there known as South Mountain  attain elevations of about 2 000 ft  600 m  in that state  South Mountain achieves its highest point just below the Mason Dixon line in Maryland at Quirauk Mountain 2 145 ft  654 m  and then diminishes in height southward to the Potomac River  Once in Virginia the Blue Ridge again reaches 2 000 ft  600 m  and higher  In the Virginia Blue Ridge  the following are some of the highest peaks north of the Roanoke River  Stony Man 4 031 ft  1 229 m   Hawksbill Mountain 4 066 ft  1 239 m   Apple Orchard Mountain 4 225 ft  1 288 m  and Peaks of Otter 4 001 and 3 875 ft  1 220 and 1 181 m   South of the Roanoke River  along the Blue Ridge  are Virginia s highest peaks including Whitetop Mountain 5 520 ft  1 680 m  and Mount Rogers 5 729 ft  1 746 m   the highest point in the Commonwealth  Chief summits in the southern section of the Blue Ridge are located along two main crests  the Western or Unaka Front along the Tennessee North Carolina border and the Eastern Front in North Carolina  or one of several  cross ridges  between the two main crests  Major subranges of the Eastern Front include the Black Mountains  Great Craggy Mountains  and Great Balsam Mountains  and its chief summits include Grandfather Mountain 5 964 ft  1 818 m  near the Tennessee North Carolina border  Mount Mitchell 6 684 ft  2 037 m  in the Blacks  and Black Balsam Knob 6 214 ft  1 894 m  and Cold Mountain 6 030 ft  1 840 m  in the Great Balsams  The Western Blue Ridge Front is subdivided into the Unaka Range  the Bald Mountains  the Great Smoky Mountains  and the Unicoi Mountains  and its major peaks include Roan Mountain 6 285 ft  1 916 m  in the Unakas  Big Bald 5 516 ft  1 681 m  and Max Patch 4 616 ft  1 407 m  in the Bald Mountains  Clingmans Dome 6 643 ft  2 025 m   Mount Le Conte 6 593 feet  2 010 m   and Mount Guyot 6 621 ft  2 018 m  in the Great Smokies  and Big Frog Mountain 4 224 ft  1 287 m  near the Tennessee Georgia North Carolina border  Prominent summits in the cross ridges include Waterrock Knob  6 292 ft  1 918 m   in the Plott Balsams  Across northern Georgia  numerous peaks exceed 4 000 ft  1 200 m   including Brasstown Bald  the state s highest  at 4 784 ft  1 458 m  and 4 696 ft  1 431 m  Rabun Bald   edit  Drainage The Appalachian Mountains are such an ancient mountain range that it has at least one river that flows across it  something that is impossible with newer and higher mountain ranges such as the Rocky Mountains or the Andes  The New River rises in the middle of the Appalachians in northwestern North Carolina  This river must have been even older than the mountain range  and as the Appalachians and the Blue Ridge Mountains rose  the New River kept pace with the growth of the mountains  cutting its gorge ever deeper  and continuing to flow north  After flowing into West Virginia  the New River continues in the New River Gorge until it flows into the Kanawha River  which is a mere change of name for the river  This river flows into the Ohio River  which then flows west  There are many other geological issues concerning the rivers and streams of the Appalachians  In spite of the existence of the Great Appalachian Valley  many of the main rivers are transverse to the axis of this mountain system  The drainage divide of the Appalachians follows a tortuous course which crosses the mountainous belt just north of the New River in Virginia  South of the New River the rivers head into the Blue Ridge  cross the higher Unakas  receive important tributaries from the Great Valley  and traversing the Cumberland Plateau in spreading gorges  escape by way of the Cumberland River and the Tennessee River rivers to the Ohio River and the Mississippi River  and thence to the Gulf of Mexico  In the central section  north of the New River  the rivers  rising in or just beyond the Valley Ridges  flow through great gorges  water gaps  to the Great Valley  and then across the Blue Ridge to tidal estuaries penetrating the coastal plain via the Roanoke River  James River  Potomac River  and Susquehanna River  In the northern section the height of land lies on the inland side of the mountainous belt  and thus the main lines of drainage runs from north to south  exemplified by the Hudson River  However  the valley through which the Hudson River flows was cut by the gigantic glaciers of the Ice Ages   the same glaciers that deposited their terminal moraines in southern New York State and formed the east west Long Island   edit  Geology Main article  Geology of the Appalachians Paleogeographic reconstruction showing the Appalachian Basin area during the Middle Devonian period  14  A look at rocks exposed in today s Appalachian mountains reveals elongated belts of folded and thrust faulted marine sedimentary rocks  volcanic rocks and slivers of ancient ocean floor  which provides strong evidence that these rocks were deformed during plate collision  The birth of the Appalachian ranges  some 480 Ma  marks the first of several mountain building plate collisions that culminated in the construction of the supercontinent Pangaea with the Appalachians near the center  Because North America and Africa were connected  the Appalachians formed part of the same mountain chain as the Little Atlas in Morocco  This mountain range  known as the Central Pangean Mountains  extended into Scotland  from the North America Europe collision   see Caledonian orogeny  During the middle Ordovician Period  about 496 440 Ma   a change in plate motions set the stage for the first Paleozoic mountain building event  Taconic orogeny  in North America  The once quiet Appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring oceanic plate  the Iapetus  collided with and began sinking beneath the North American craton  With the birth of this new subduction zone  the early Appalachians were born  Along the continental margin  volcanoes grew  coincident with the initiation of subduction  Thrust faulting uplifted and warped older sedimentary rock laid down on the passive margin  As mountains rose  erosion began to wear them down  Streams carried rock debris down slope to be deposited in nearby lowlands  The Taconic Orogeny was just the first of a series of mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the Appalachians  culminating in the collision of North America and Africa  see Appalachian orogeny   3  By the end of the Mesozoic era  the Appalachian Mountains had been eroded to an almost flat plain  3  It was not until the region was uplifted during the Cenozoic Era that the distinctive topography of the present formed  15  Uplift rejuvenated the streams  which rapidly responded by cutting downward into the ancient bedrock  Some streams flowed along weak layers that define the folds and faults created many millions of years earlier  Other streams downcut so rapidly that they cut right across the resistant folded rocks of the mountain core  carving canyons across rock layers and geologic structures   edit  Mineral resources The Appalachian Mountains contain major deposits of anthracite coal as well as bituminous coal  In the folded mountains the coal is in metamorphosed form as anthracite  represented by the Coal Region of northeastern Pennsylvania  The bituminous coal fields of western Pennsylvania  western Maryland  southeastern Ohio  eastern Kentucky  southwestern Virginia  and West Virginia contain the sedimentary form of coal  16  The mountain top removal method of coal mining  in which entire mountain tops are removed  is currently threatening vast areas and ecosystems of the Appalachian Mountain region  17  The discovery in 1859 of commercial quantities of petroleum in the Appalachian mountains of western Pennsylvania started the modern United States petroleum industry  18  Recent discoveries of commercial natural gas deposits in the Marcellus Shale formation have once again focused oil industry attention on the Appalachian Basin  Some plateaus of the Appalachian Mountains contain metallic minerals such as iron and zinc  19   edit  Ecology Further information  Appalachian Blue Ridge forests and Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests  edit  Flora View from Mount Mitchell  At 6 684 ft  2 037 m   Mount Mitchell in North Carolina is the highest peak east of the Mississippi River  The floras of the Appalachians are diverse and vary primarily in response to geology  latitude  elevation and moisture availability  Geobotanically  they constitute a floristic province of the North American Atlantic Region  The Appalachians consist primarily of deciduous broad leaf trees and evergreen needle leaf conifers  but also contain the evergreen broad leaf American Holly  Ilex opaca   and the deciduous needle leaf conifer  the Tamarack  or Eastern Larch  Larix laricina   The dominant northern and high elevation conifer is the Red Spruce  Picea rubens   which grows from near sea level to above 4 000 ft  1 200 m  above sea level  asl  in northern New England and southeastern Canada  It also grows southward along the Appalachian crest to the highest elevations of the southern Appalachians  as in North Carolina and Tennessee  In the central Appalachians it is usually confined above 3 000 ft  900 m  asl  except for a few cold valleys in which it reaches lower elevations  In the southern Appalachians it is restricted to higher elevations  Another species is the Black Spruce  Picea mariana   which extends farthest north of any conifer in North America  is found at high elevations in the northern Appalachians  and in bogs as far south as Pennsylvania  The Appalachians are also home to two species of fir  the boreal Balsam Fir  Abies balsamea   and the southern high elevation endemic  Fraser Fir  Abies fraseri   Fraser Fir is confined to the highest parts of the southern Appalachian Mountains  where along with Red Spruce it forms a fragile ecosystem known as the Southern Appalachian spruce fir forest  Fraser Fir rarely occurs below 5 500 ft  1 700 m   and becomes the dominant tree type at 6 200 ft  1 900 m   20  By contrast  Balsam Fir is found from near sea level to the tree line in the northern Appalachians  but ranges only as far south as Virginia and West Virginia in the central Appalachians  where it is usually confined above 3 900 ft  1 200 m  asl  except in cold valleys  Curiously  it is associated with oaks in Virginia  The Balsam Fir of Virginia and West Virginia is thought by some to be a natural hybrid between the more northern variety and Fraser Fir  While Red Spruce is common in both upland and bog habitats  Balsam Fir  as well as Black Spruce and Tamarack  are more characteristic of the latter  However Balsam Fir also does well in soils with a pH as high as 6  21  Eastern or Canada Hemlock  Tsuga canadensis  is another important evergreen needle leaf conifer that grows along the Appalachian chain from north to south  but is confined to lower elevations than Red Spruce and the firs  It generally occupies richer and less acidic soils than the spruce and firs and is characteristic of deep  shaded and moist mountain valleys and coves  It is  unfortunately  subject to the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid  Adelges tsugae   an introduced insect  that is rapidly extirpating it as a forest tree  Less abundant  and restricted to the southern Appalachians  is Carolina Hemlock  Tsuga caroliniana   Like Canada Hemlock  this tree suffers severely from the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid  Several species of pines characteristic of the Appalachians are Eastern White Pine  Pinus strobus    Virginia Pine  Pinus virginiana   Pitch Pine  Pinus rigida    Table Mountain Pine  Pinus pungens  and Shortleaf Pine  Pinus echinata   Red Pine  Pinus resinosa  is a boreal species that forms a few high elevation outliers as far south as West Virginia  All of these species except White Pine tend to occupy sandy  rocky  poor soil sites  which are mostly acidic in character  White Pine  a large species valued for its timber  tends to do best in rich  moist soil  either acidic or alkaline in character  Pitch Pine is also at home in acidic  boggy soil  and Table Mountain Pine may occasionally be found in this habitat as well  Shortleaf Pine is generally found in warmer habitats and at lower elevations than the other species  All the species listed do best in open or lightly shaded habitats  although White Pine also thrives in shady coves  valleys  and on floodplains  The view from Craggy Gardens on the Blue Ridge Parkway  The Appalachians are characterized by a wealth of large  beautiful deciduous broadleaf  hardwood  trees  Their occurrences are best summarized and described in E  Lucy Braun s 1950 classic  Deciduous Forests of Eastern North America  Macmillan  New York   The most diverse and richest forests are the Mixed Mesophytic or medium moisture types  which are largely confined to rich  moist montane soils of the southern and central Appalachians  particularly in the Cumberland and Allegheny Mountains  but also thrive in the southern Appalachian coves  Characteristic canopy species are White Basswood  Tilia heterophylla   Yellow Buckeye  Aesculus octandra   Sugar Maple  Acer saccharum   American Beech  Fagus grandifolia   Tuliptree  Liriodendron tulipifera   White Ash  Fraxinus americana   and Yellow Birch  Betula alleganiensis   Other common trees are Red Maple  Acer rubrum   Shagbark and Bitternut Hickories  Carya ovata and C  cordiformis  and Black or Sweet Birch  Betula lenta    Small understory trees and shrubs include Flowering Dogwood  Cornus florida   Hophornbeam  Ostrya virginiana   Witch hazel  Hamamelis virginiana  and Spicebush  Lindera benzoin   There are also hundreds of perennial and annual herbs  among them such herbal and medicinal plants as American Ginseng  Panax quinquefolius   Goldenseal  Hydrastis canadensis   Bloodroot  Sanguinaria canadensis  and Black Cohosh  Cimicifuga racemosa   The foregoing trees  shrubs and herbs are also more widely distributed in less rich mesic forests that generally occupy coves  stream valleys and flood plains throughout the southern and central Appalachians at low and intermediate elevations  In the northern Appalachians and at higher elevations of the central and southern Appalachians these diverse mesic forests give way to less diverse  Northern Hardwoods  with canopies dominated only by American Beech  Sugar Maple  American Basswood  Tilia americana  and Yellow Birch and with far fewer species of shrubs and herbs  Dryer and rockier uplands and ridges are occupied by Oak Chestnut type forests dominated by a variety of oaks  Quercus spp    hickories  Carya spp   and  in the past  by the American Chestnut  Castanea dentata   The American Chestnut was virtually eliminated as a canopy species by the introduced fungal Chestnut Blight  Cryphonectaria parasitica   but lives on as sapling sized sprouts that originate from roots  which are not killed by the fungus  In present day forest canopies Chestnut has been largely replaced by oaks  The oak forests of the southern and central Appalachians consist largely of Black  Northern Red  White  Chestnut and Scarlet Oaks  Quercus velutina  Q  rubra  Q  alba  Q  prinus and Q  coccinea  and hickories  such as the Pignut  Carya glabra  in particular  The richest forests  which grade into mesic types  usually in coves and on gentle slopes  have dominantly White and Northern Red Oaks  while the driest sites are dominated by Chestnut Oak  or sometimes by Scarlet or Northern Red Oaks  In the northern Appalachians the oaks  except for White and Northern Red  drop out  while the latter extends farthest north  Great Laurel thicket in the Pisgah National Forest  The oak forests generally lack the diverse small tree  shrub and herb layers of mesic forests  Shrubs are generally ericaceous  and include the evergreen Mountain Laurel  Kalmia latifolia   various species of blueberries  Vaccinium spp    Black Huckleberry  Gaylussacia baccata   a number of deciduous rhododendrons  azaleas   and smaller heaths such as Teaberry   Gaultheria procumbens  and Trailing Arbutus  Epigaea repens    The evergreen Great Rhododendron  Rhododendron maximum  is characteristic of moist stream valleys  These occurrences are in line with the prevailing acidic character of most oak forest soils  In contrast  the much rarer Chinquapin Oak  Quercus muehlenbergii  demands alkaline soils and generally grows where limestone rock is near the surface  Hence no ericaceous shrubs are associated with it  The Appalachian floras also include a diverse assemblage of bryophytes  mosses and liverworts   as well as fungi  Some species are rare and or endemic  As with vascular plants  these tend to be closely related to the character of the soils and thermal environment in which they are found  Eastern deciduous forests are subject to a number of serious insect and disease outbreaks  Among the most conspicuous is that of the introduced Gypsy Moth  Lymantria dispar   which infests primarily oaks  causing severe defoliation and tree mortality  But it also has the benefit of eliminating weak individuals  and thus improving the genetic stock  as well as creating rich habitat of a type through accumulation of dead wood  Because hardwoods sprout so readily  this moth is not as harmful as the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid  Perhaps more serious is the introduced Beech Bark Disease Complex  which includes both a scale insect  Cryptococcus fagisuga  and fungal components  During the 19th and early 20th centuries the Appalachian forests were subject to severe and destructive logging and land clearing  which resulted in the designation of the National Forests and Parks as well many state protected areas  However  these and a variety of other destructive activities continue  albeit in diminished forms  and thus far only a few ecologically based management practices have taken hold   edit  Fauna Animals that characterize the Appalachian forests include five species of tree squirrels  The most commonly seen is the low to moderate elevation Eastern Gray Squirrel  Sciurus carolinensis   Occupying similar habitat is the slightly larger Fox Squirrel  Sciurus niger  and the much smaller Southern Flying Squirrel  Glaucomys volans   More characteristic of cooler northern and high elevation habitat is the Red Squirrel  Tamiasciurus hudsonicus   whereas the Appalachian Northern Flying Squirrel  Glaucomys sabrinus fuscus   which closely resembles the Southern Flying Squirrel  is confined to northern hardwood and spruce fir forests  Southern flying squirrel  As familiar as squirrels are the Eastern Cottontail rabbit  Silvilagus floridanus  and the White tailed Deer  Odocoileus virginianus   The latter in particular has greatly increased in abundance as a result of the extirpation of the Eastern Wolf  Canis lupus lycaon  and the North American Cougar  This has led to the overgrazing and browsing of many plants of the Appalachian forests  as well as destruction of agricultural crops  Other deer include the Moose  Alces alces    found only in the north  and the Elk  Cervus canadensis   which  although once extirpated  is now making a comeback  through transplantation  in the southern and central Appalachians  In Quebec  the Chic Chocs host the only population of Caribou  Rangifer tarandus  south of the St  Lawrence River  An additional species that is common in the north but extends its range southward at high elevations to Virginia and West Virginia is the Varying or Snowshoe Hare  Lepus americanus   However  these central Appalachian populations are scattered and very small  Another species of great interest is the Beaver  Castor canadensis   which is showing a great resurgence in numbers after its near extirpation for its pelt  This resurgence is bringing about a drastic alteration in habitat through the construction of dams and other structures throughout the mountains  Other common forest animals are the Black Bear  Ursus americanus   Striped Skunk  Mephitis mephitis   Raccoon  Procyon lotor   Woodchuck  Marmota monax   Bobcat  Felis rufus   Gray Fox  Urocyon cinereoargenteus   Red Fox  Vulpes vulpes  and in recent years  the Coyote  Canis latrans   another species favored by the advent of Europeans and the extirpation of Eastern and Red Wolves  European boars were introduced in the early 20th century  Characteristic birds of the forest are Wild Turkey  Meleagris gallopavo silvestris   Ruffed Grouse  Bonasa umbellus   Mourning Dove  Zenaida macroura   Common Raven  Corvus corax   Wood Duck  Aix sponsa   Great Horned Owl  Bubo virginianus   Barred Owl  Strix varia   Screech Owl  Megascops asio   Red tailed Hawk  Buteo jamaicensis   Red shouldered Hawk  Buteo lineatus   and Northern Goshawk  Accipiter gentilis   as well as a great variety of  songbirds   Passeriformes   like the warblers in particular  Male Eastern Wild Turkey  Of great importance are the many species of salamanders  and in particular the lungless species  Family Plethodontidae  that live in great abundance concealed by leaves and debris  on the forest floor  Most frequently seen  however  is the Eastern or Red spotted Newt  Notophthalmus viridescens   whose terrestrial eft form is often encountered on the open  dry forest floor  It has been estimated that salamanders represent the largest class of animal biomass in the Appalachian forests  Frogs and toads are of lesser diversity and abundance  but the Wood Frog  Rana sylvatica  is  like the eft  commonly encountered on the dry forest floor  while a number of species of small frogs  such as Spring Peepers  Pseudacris crucifer   enliven the forest with their calls  Salamanders and other amphibians contribute greatly to nutrient cycling through their consumption of small life forms on the forest floor and in aquatic habitats  Although reptiles are less abundant and diverse than amphibians  a number of snakes are conspicuous members of the fauna  One of the largest is the non poisonous Black Rat Snake  Elaphe obsoleta obsoleta   while the Common Garter Snake  Thamnophis sirtalis  is among the smallest but most abundant  The American Copperhead  Agkistrodon contortrix  and the Timber Rattler  Crotalus horridus  are poisonous pit vipers  There are few lizards  but the Broad headed Skink  Eumeces laticeps   at up to 13 in  33 cm  in length  and an excellent climber and swimmer  is one of the largest and most spectacular in appearance and action  The most common turtle is the Eastern Box Turtle  Terrapene carolina carolina   which is found in both upland and lowland forests in the central and southern Appalachians  Prominent among aquatic species is the large Common Snapping Turtle  Chelydra serpentina   which occurs throughout the Appalachians  Appalachian streams are notable for their highly diverse freshwater fish life  Among the most abundant and diverse are those of the minnow family  Family Cyprinidae   while species of the colorful Darters  Percina spp   are also abundant  22  A characteristic fish of shaded  cool Appalachian forest streams is the Wild Brook or Speckled Trout  Salvelinus fontinalis   which is much sought after for its sporting qualities  However in past years such trout waters have been much degraded by increasing temperatures because of timber cutting  global warming and by pollution from various sources   edit  Influence on history For a century  the Appalachians were a barrier to the westward expansion of the British colonies  The continuity of the mountain system  the bewildering multiplicity of its succeeding ridges  the tortuous courses and roughness of its transverse passes  a heavy forest  and dense undergrowth all conspired to hold the settlers on the seaward sloping plateaus and coastal plains  Only by way of the Hudson and Mohawk Valleys  and round about the southern termination of the system were there easy routes to the interior of the country  and these were long closed by powerful Native American tribes such as the Iroquois  Creek  and Cherokee  among others  Expansion was also blocked by the alliances the British Empire had forged with Native American tribes  the proximity of the Spanish colonies in the south and French activity throughout the interior  In eastern Pennsylvania the Great Appalachian Valley  or Great Valley  was accessible by reason of a broad gateway between the end of South Mountain and the Highlands  and here between the Susquehanna and Delaware Rivers settled many Germans and Moravians forming the Pennsylvania Dutch community  some of whom even now speak a unique American dialect of German known as the  Pennsylvania German language   also known as  Pennsylvania Dutch    These were late comers to the New World forced to the frontier to find cheap land  With their followers of both German  English and Scots Irish origin  they worked their way southward and soon occupied all of the Shenandoah Valley  ceded by the Iroquois  and the upper reaches of the Great Valley tributaries of the Tennessee River  ceded by the Cherokee  By 1755  the obstacle to westward expansion had been thus reduced by half  outposts of the English colonists had penetrated the Allegheny and Cumberland plateaus  threatening French monopoly in the transmontane region  and a conflict became inevitable  Making common cause against the French to determine the control of the Ohio valley  the unsuspected strength of the colonists was revealed  and the successful ending of the French and Indian War extended England s territory to the Mississippi  To this strength the geographic isolation enforced by the Appalachian mountains had been a prime contributor  The confinement of the colonies between an ocean and a mountain wall led to the fullest occupation of the coastal border of the continent  which was possible under existing conditions of agriculture  conducing to a community of purpose  a political and commercial solidarity  which would not otherwise have been developed  As early as 1700 it was possible to ride from Portland  Maine  to southern Virginia  sleeping each night at some considerable village  In contrast to this complete industrial occupation  the French territory was held by a small and very scattered population  its extent and openness adding materially to the difficulties of a disputed tenure  Bearing the brunt of this contest as they did  the colonies were undergoing preparation for the subsequent struggle with the home government  Unsupported by shipping  the American armies fought toward the sea with the mountains at their back protecting them against British leagued with the Native Americans  The few settlements beyond the Great Valley were free for self defense because debarred from general participation in the conflict by reason of their position  Mount Carleton  the highest mountain in the New Brunswick section of the Appalachian Mountains  Before the French and Indian War  the Appalachian Mountains lay on the indeterminate boundary between Britain s colonies along the Atlantic and French areas centered in the Mississippi basin  After the French and Indian War  the Proclamation of 1763 restricted settlement for Great Britain s thirteen original colonies in North America to east of the summit line of the mountains  except in the northern regions where the Great Lakes formed the boundary   Although the line was adjusted several times to take frontier settlements into account and was impossible to enforce as law  it was strongly resented by backcountry settlers throughout the Appalachians  The Proclamation Line can be seen as one of the grievances which led to the American Revolutionary War  Many frontier settlers held that the defeat of the French opened the land west of the mountains to English settlement  only to find settlement barred by the British King s proclamation  The backcountry settlers who fought in the Illinois campaign of George Rogers Clark were motivated to secure their settlement of Kentucky  With the formation of the United States  an important first phase of westward expansion in the late 18th century and early 19th century consisted of the migration of European descended settlers westward across the mountains into the Ohio Valley through the Cumberland Gap and other mountain passes  The Erie Canal  finished in 1825  formed the first route through the Appalachians that was capable of large amounts of commerce   edit  See also Geography of Canada portal Appalachia Appalachian League Appalachian Mountain Club  edit  Notes   There are at least
