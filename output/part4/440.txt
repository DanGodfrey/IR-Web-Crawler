with the previously created Shang Chi  Master of Kung Fu  came from Marvel Comics during a pop culture trend in the early 1970s for martial arts heroes  Debuting in a story by writer Roy Thomas and penciler Gil Kane in the umbrella title Marvel Premiere  15 25  May 1974   October 1975   he was then written successively by Len Wein  Doug Moench  Tony Isabella  and Chris Claremont  with art by successive pencillers Larry Hama  Arvell Jones  Pat Broderick  and  in some of his earliest professional work  John Byrne  Following this run  Iron Fist was immediately spun off into the solo series Iron Fist  which ran 15 issues  November 1975   September 1977   The solo series was written by Claremont and pencilled by Byrne  A subplot involving Steel Serpent left unresolved by the cancellation of the series was wrapped up in issues  63 64 of Marvel Team Up  Iron Fist joined the cast of the Luke Cage series in a three parter story in Power Man  48 50  The title series changed to Power Man and Iron Fist with issue  50  although the indicia did not reflect this change until issue  67  Iron Fist co starred the series until the final issue   125  September 1986   Two solo miniseries followed a decade later  Iron Fist  vol  2   1 2  September   October 1996   by writer James Felder and penciller Robert Brown  and Iron Fist  vol  3   1 3  July   September 1998   by writer Dan Jurgens and penciller Jackson Guice  Also around this time  he was among the ensemble of the group series Heroes for Hire which ran 19 issues  July 1997   January 1999   Following a four issue miniseries by writer Jay Faerber and penciller Jamal Igle  Iron Fist  Wolverine  November 2000   February 2001   co starring the X Men character Wolverine and cover billed as Iron Fist Wolverine  The

Iron Fist  by co writers Ed Brubaker and Matt Fraction and primary artist David Aja  premiered with a January 2007 cover date  Duane Swierczynski took over the series from issue  17  1  Writer co creator Roy Thomas wrote in a text piece in Marvel Premiere  15 that Iron Fist s origin and creation owe much to the 1940s Bill Everett character  Amazing Man  Thomas later wrote that he and artist co creator Gil Kane had         started  Iron Fist  because I d seen my first kung fu movie  even before a Bruce Lee one came out  and it had a thing called  the ceremony of the Iron Fist  in it  I thought that was a good name  and we already had Master of Kung Fu going  but I thought   Maybe a superhero called Iron Fist  even though we had Iron Man  would be a good idea    Publisher  Stan  Lee  liked the name  so I got hold of Gil and he brought in his Amazing Man influences  and we designed the character together    2    Iron Fist appearances outside his own title include three Iron Fist stories in Marvel s black and white comics magazine Deadly Hands of Kung Fu  10  March 1975   an additional story co starring the Sons of the Tiger in issue  18  November 1975   and a six part serial   The Living Weapon   in  19 24  December 1975   May 1976   He made guest appearances in such titles as Marvel Two in One  Marvel Team Up  the Sub Mariner series Namor  Black Panther  and Daredevil   edit  Fictional character biography  edit  Background Daniel Rand was born in New York City  the son of American businessman Wendell Rand  a wealthy entrepreneur who discovered the mystical city of K un L un as a young boy  During his time in K un L un  Wendell saved the life of the city s ruler  Lord Tuan  and was adopted as Tuan s son  However  Wendell eventually left K un L un and became a wealthy entrepreneur in the United States  He married socialite Heather Duncan and had a child  Daniel  When Daniel was nine  Wendell organized an expedition to again seek out K un L un  taking his wife Heather  his business partner Harold Meachum  and Daniel  During the journey up the mountain  Daniel slipped off the path  his tie rope taking his mother and father with him  Meachum  who also loved Heather  forced Wendell to plunge to his death but offered to rescue Heather and Daniel  She rejected his help  preferring to journey without him or die  As explained in Marvel Premiere  15  Heather and Daniel come across a makeshift bridge that appears out of nowhere and are attacked by a pack of wolves  Heather throws herself on the wolves to save Daniel and is killed even as archers from K un L un attempt to save her  The archers take the grieving Daniel to see Y  Ti  the hooded ruler of K un L un  When Daniel expresses his desire for vengeance  Y  Ti apprentices him to Lei Kung  the Thunderer  who teaches him the martial arts  Daniel proves to be the most gifted of Lei Kung s students  Rand conditions his fists by plunging them into buckets of sand  gravel  and rock to toughen them  At 19  Daniel is given the chance to attain the power of the Iron Fist by fighting and defeating the dragon known as Shou Lao the Undying  which guarded the molten heart that had been torn from its body  During the battle  Daniel throws himself against the scar of Shou Lao  which burns a dragon tattoo into his chest  Having killed Shou Lao  he enters its cave and plunges his fists into a brazier containing the creature s molten heart  emerging with the power of the Iron Fist  It is later revealed that there have been many Iron Fists before Daniel  making him the modern member of a long lineage of Iron Fists  When K un L un reappears on Earth after 10 years  Daniel decides to leave and find his father s killer  Returning to New York  Daniel Rand  dressed in the ceremonial garb of the Iron Fist  seeks out Harold Meachum  now head of Meachum Industries  After overcoming a number of attempts on his life  he confronts Meachum in his office  only to find the man legless an amputation carried out when  after abandoning Daniel and his mother  he was caught in heavy snow and his legs became frostbitten  Impressed by Iron Fist s abilities  Meachum accepts his fate and tells Iron Fist to kill him  but overcome with pity for this pathetic shell of a man  Iron Fist walks away  At that moment Meachum is murdered by a mysterious ninja 3  and his daughter Joy blames Iron Fist for the death  4  Eventually  Iron Fist clears his name and begins a career as a superhero  aided by his friends Colleen Wing and Misty Knight  falling in love with the latter  5  Notable adversaries in his early career include the first appearance of the villain Sabretooth  who was not yet known to be connected to Wolverine   the mysterious Master Khan  whom the ninja that killed Meachum once served   and the Steel Serpent  the exiled son of Lei Kung  who coveted the Iron Fist power   edit  Heroes for Hire Iron Fist met the hero Iron Man early in his career  6  Soon after that  he recounted his first battle with the H ylthri  7  Just before Rand s battle with Steel Serpent  Misty Knight had been working undercover  infiltrating the organization of the crime lord John Bushmaster  When Bushmaster discovered Knight s treachery  he kidnapped Claire Temple and Noah Burstein  the closest associates of Luke Cage  better known as Power Man  holding them hostage to force Cage to eliminate Knight  Iron Fist was on hand to stop him  however  and after a battle  the truth came out  Rand then helped Cage and the Daughters of the Dragon  Knight and Wing  battle Bushmaster  and rescue Temple and Burstein as well as obtain evidence that proved Cage s innocence on prior drug charges  Iron Fist and Power Man decided to become partners  forming Heroes for Hire  Inc  8  Although Iron Fist and Power Man supposedly were only heroes for money  they were always doing the right thing  which usually left them with less money rather than more  Iron Fist  in his secret identity of Daniel Rand  had reassumed control of his parents  fortune as half of Rand Meachum  Inc   and was actually quite wealthy  This caused a lot of tension between him and Cage  who was raised poor in the ghetto  even though Rand had actually handed control of his company over to other managers while he learned how to cope in the real world after so long living in K un L un rather than relying on money that he had inherited  At one point  the pair traveled to K un L un together  where they battled Master Khan  9  Power Man and Iron Fist s partnership ended with Rand contracting cancer from radiation poisoning and inadvertently dying at the hands of Captain Hero  and Cage becoming a fugitive as the prime suspect in Rand s death  10   edit  Resurrection In the 1990s  the storyline of Rand s death is resolved in the pages of Namor  Although Rand apparently returns from the dead  it is revealed instead to be the Super Skrull  He admits that he had been Captain Hero  and that the plot to destroy the lives of Rand and Cage had been masterminded by Master Khan  It is also revealed that the  Iron Fist  that had died was actually a doppelg nger created by the extra dimensional H ylthri  Rand had  in fact  been kidnapped and replaced by the H ylthri copy just after he left K un L un for the last time  11  While in stasis with the H ylthri  Rand manages to focus his chi  curing the cancer  Iron Fist is later discovered alive in K un L un  With Namor and Misty Knight  he battles Master Khan once more  12  After Marvel s Onslaught crossover event  Rand and Cage reform Heroes for Hire  Inc  with an expanded team  this time working for Namor s Oracle Corporation  Chronicled in a new Heroes for Hire series  the title is eventually canceled due to low sales  ending with Namor dissolving Oracle as well as Heroes for Hire  Inc  Iron Fist at one point also lost his powers to Junzo Muto  13  the young leader of the Hand  but subsequently regained them  14  In the Iron Fist miniseries  Miranda Rand K ai also returns from the dead  The H ylthri revive her and promise to restore her to full life if she retrieves the extra dimensional artifact known as the Zodiac Key  To this end  she takes the identity of Death Sting  bringing her into conflict with Iron Fist as well as with S H I E L D  When the H ylthri try to kill Iron Fist  Miranda turns the power of the Zodiac Key against them  seemingly killing herself in the process  However  exposure to chemicals from the H ylthri pods prevented her death  During the  House of M  crossover event  Rand is shown to be a part of Luke Cage s resistance group   edit  Civil War and Daredevil Danny Rand as Daredevil  Art by Michael Lark  Rand disguises himself as Daredevil to convince the media and the public that Matt Murdock is not

17  During the Dark Reign storyline  Rand leaves the New Avengers due to a variety of problems but lets them know if they ever need him to give him a call  He then participates in searching for Luke and Jessica s daughter Danielle  taking out a HYDRA cell with Spider Woman thinking the Skrull Jarvis has contacted Earth villains looking for a way out of New York or the Earth  18  Rand was taken captive by Norman Osborn s Thunderbolts and brainwashed into fighting Luke Cage as part of a mental reconditioning project Osborn created to use on other heroes to do his bidding  However  Rand manages to shake off the brainwashing by using his focused chi energy to clear his mind  19  Later along with Misty Knight  Doctor Strange  Doctor Voodoo  Hellcat  Valkyrie  Daredevil  and the Thing

 1  Art by David Aja  In 2006  Marvel launched a new ongoing series  The Immortal Iron Fist  co written by Ed Brubaker and Matt Fraction and featuring art by Spanish illustrator David Aja   The Immortal Iron Fist  began with a six part arc  counter intuitively titled  The Last Iron Fist Story   The story reveals the Iron Fist to be a legacy power conferred on the champion of K un Lun roughly once a generation  There have been sixty six Iron Fists  K un L un is also revealed as one of the Seven Cities of Heaven  each of which has an analogous champion Warrior  The story introduces Orson Randall  Daniel Rand s immediate predecessor  who reneged on his responsibilities to K un L un after suffering immense psychological trauma during the First World War  Randall is discovered in Thailand  apparently preserved by the spirit of Shou Lao and in full possession of his powers  but living in drug soaked seclusion  Randall is pursued by agents of the Steel Serpent and the terrorist group HYDRA  Jolted out of his decades long ennui  Randall seeks out Daniel Rand in New York and gives him The Book of the Iron Fist  a sacred ledger supposedly containing all the Kung fu secrets of previous Iron Fists  which Randall claims will be necessary if Rand is to compete successfully in the coming tournament of the Seven Champions  The Steel Serpent  whose powers have been greatly augmented by Crane Mother  quickly dispatches Randall in single combat  On the brink of death  Randall surrenders his Chi to Rand  giving him sufficient power to battle the Serpent to a standstill  After the battle  Rand is immediately summoned by his master  Lei Kung  who is also the father of Steel Serpent  to compete in a tournament that will decide the cycle according to which each of the Seven Cities of Heaven appears on Earth  However  the leaders of the Seven Cities had secretly erected gateways between Earth and each city without the knowledge of the populace  The corruption of the leaders of the Seven Cities of Heaven has spurred Iron Fist  his master Lei Kung the Thunderer  Orson Randall s daughter  and John Aman to secretly plan a revolution  Iron Fist discovers that Crane Mother  and Xao  a high ranking HYDRA operative  are planning to destroy K un Lun by using a portal  Upon learning of the plot Steel Serpent helps Rand and the other Immortal weapons to defeat Xao  Rand destroys the train intended to destroy K un Lun by extending his chi to find the train s electromagnetic field  transforming himself into  a human bullet   Meanwhile  the revolution orchestrated by Lei Kung and Orson s daughter proves successful  with Nu an  the Yu Ti of K un Lun fleeing in terror  When Rand confronts Xao  Xao reveals that there is an eighth city of Heaven before killing himself  Steel Serpent ultimately seeks to redeem himself to his father and to the populace  Rand suggests Lei Kung as the new Yu Ti  with Orson s unnamed daughter as the new Thunderer  21  After the events  and learning that the Randall fortune that started Rand International was formed from the oppression of the Cities of Heaven  Rand decides to transform the company into a non profit organization  dedicated to helping the poor  He also sets up the Thunder Dojo in Harlem to help inner city children  buys back the old Heroes for Hire building as the new Rand International Headquarters  and his new home  while offering Luke Cage a position at the company  He also tries to reconnect with Misty Knight  Rand  on his 33rd birthday  soon learns a disturbing fact about the previous Iron Fists  every single one has died at the age of 33  except Orson Randell  who vanished at that same time  22  Soon afterward Rand is attacked by a servant of Ch l Lin  defeating Rand easily  He claims that he has killed many Iron Fists  However  Luke  Misty  and Coleen arrive just as the servant prepares to slay Rand  Luke manages to get hold of the mysterious assassin  but he then suddenly vanishes  Rand searches for answers in the Book of the Iron Fist to try to understand how Orson Randall was able to avoid being slain by the Ch l Lin s assassin  However  one of Rand s new business associates calls Rand up to alert him of the Ch l Lin assassin staking out the Thunder Dojo  Rand heads for the dojo  where he finds the assassin  whose real name has been revealed as Zhou Cheng  Cheng has placed some sort of telepathic command upon the students to kill each other if Rand does not surrender  Rand bows before him  but this is quickly revealed to be only a ploy  as Luke  Misty  and the other Immortal weapons arrive to aid Rand  While still formidable in combat  Rand correctly guessed that an opponent who was tailored to fight the Iron Fist would not be as effective against the other weapons  The group defeats Cheng  but he vanishes into thin air  The Immortal weapons embark on a hunt for Cheng  while Rand attempts to learn about his new adversary  He soon learns that Orson Randall was only able to escape Cheng by addicting himself to heroin  thus damping his chi and leaving Cheng under the assumption that he had died  While searching for a way to defeat Cheng in the Book of the Iron Fist  Rand discovers that his assistant  Nadine  is an accomplice to Cheng  after she poisons his coffee  While Rand s chi prevents the poison from killing him  it is sufficiently strong to weaken him significantly  All of a sudden  Cheng arrives in Rand s office  thanks Nadine  who  although being Cheng s  beloved   appears to have been a rather reluctant accomplice   and prepares to finish what he and Rand started  Just then  Nadine steps in and attempts to stop Cheng  revealing to him that she is pregnant with his child  and does not wish for their baby to be the child of a murderer  Cheng  is it revealed  is seeking to retrieve the heart of the Iron Fist in order to enter K un Lun and devour the egg that births the next Shou Lao the Undying every generation  thus wiping out K un Lun s Iron Fist legacy  Despite having slain evey previous Iron Fist who did not otherwise fall in battle or relinquish their power  excepting Orson Randall   Cheng has always failed to reach the egg  23  Cheng  who it is also revealed has been slowly buying out Rand Int  over the past 20 years  throws Nadine out of the way  and continues his attack  Rand has his shoulder dislocated during the battle  but manages to defeat Cheng even in his weakened state  Following the duel  the Immortal Weapons  Luke  Coleen  and Misty arrive  and reveal to Rand that they have discovered a map in Cheng s apartment that leads to the Eighth City of Heaven  whose existence was mentioned by Xao during the tournament of the seven cities  Rand and the others realize that his is where the Ch l Lin originated  and depart for the Eighth City  24  Before their departure  Davos arrives at the behest of Lei Kung to inform Rand that the Eighth city is  in fact  a prison constructed to hold demonic creatures that had once threatened K un Lun and the other cities of Heaven and its gate only allows for passage in but not out  making it effectively synonymous with Hell  However  Davos also informs Rand that the previous Yu Ti had housed anyone who attempted to rebel against his rule in the Eighth city  and Lei Kung commissions Rand and the Immortal Weapons to rescue the wrongful prisoners  and informs them that the in not out rule can be bypassed by all six of the Immortal Weapons  Upon arrival at the gates of the city  Rand and the others are literally sucked into the depths of the city  whereupon they are attacked by the prisoners of the Eighth city  which is ruled by the nefarious Changming  and forced to fight the demons of the city one by one  each time beaten nearly to death  their Chi weakened by having been pulled into the city  and rotated repeatedly  while being allowed to heal just enough to be able to fight again  While Rand is in his cell after a fight  he hears a tapping on his cell wall  and realizes it is being done in Chinese  with the message  You are an Iron Fist  Just like me   25  Meanwhile  it is revealed that Davos has not been honest with Rand and the Immortal Weapons about their mission  as he has posted a spy outside of the gate of the Eighth City  who reports there being  no signs of life   but that  something is clearly happening   and Davos determines that this requires him to battle Rand once again  Rand s fellow prisoner reveals himself to be Quan Yaozu  the very first Iron Fist  Quan reveals that in the early days of K un Lun s history  Changming had risen to power during a time of moral decadence in the city  Changming had been the one who had originally summoned all of the demonic creatures that had once plagued K un Lun into the city  including Shou Lao the Undying  and used them to quickly conquer the city  One day  however  a lone warrior had entered the dragon s cave to challenge it  Before Quan can finish  he and Rand are removed from their cells and brought into the arena for a fight  By now  Changming has learned that Rand and the Immortal Weapons have been formulating a plan to rescue the prisoners of the Eighth City and make their escape  by leaving each other Morse code messages in the arena after each fight  Changming declares that Rand and Quan will fight to the death  Rand refuses to  fight an old man   but Quan  now in his Iron Fist suit  replies   Sorry  Young Fist  I ve been waiting for this chance for freedom Far Too Long   26  However  once the fight begins  Rand immediately senses that his opponent lacks any perceivable martial arts skills and realizes that he is not the true Quan Yaozu  As the Immortal Weapons manage to escape and defeat the guards during the fight  Changming reveals that he is  in fact  the true Quan Yaozu  He explains that he voluntarily stayed in the Eighth City to keep K un Lun s demons from escaping  However  upon seeing his lost love thrown into the Eighth City  Quan became disillusioned  and believed that K un Lun was not worth saving  eventually rising up to rule the Eighth City as Changming  Rand and Fat Cobra manage to defeat Quan in the battle  and prepare to ask him the true nature of the Eighth City and why they have been sent there  27  However  Rand soon discovers that the Immortal Weapons are pawns in a plan Quan has hatched  As the door to the Eighth City can only be opened from the inside by the Immortal Weapons  his plan was for the Immortal Weapons to make an escape attempt  thereby opening the gate and unleashing Quan and his army to take his revenge on the Seven Cities for having sentenced him and many of their citizens to an eternity in the Eighth City  Quan forces Rand to lead him out of Eighth City and back to K un Lun  but after making it outside the gate  the two encounter Davos  who is waiting outside the gate with a sniper rifle  He tells Rand that he has been sent there by Lei Kung to assassinate Quan  as he and Lei Kung believe that Rand lacks the ability to take a life  In the ensuing battle  Rand manages to defeat both Davos and Quan  going as far as to take a bullet in the hand for the latter  Rand s actions impress Quan  who decides that Rand may be living proof that K un Lun is not the corrupt city it once was  Rand and Davos agree to guide Quan to K un Lun and arrange a meeting between him and Lei Kung to give Quan a forum for his grievances  28  However  when Rand returns to New York  he finds a HYDRA cell waiting for him at Rand International  seeking retribution for the death of Xao  and holding Misty hostage  In the ensuing battle  Rand Int  is destroyed  but Rand and Misty escape unharmed  With Rand Int  destroyed and now left with only a fraction of his former net worth  Rand and Misty purchase a new condo in Harlem  and Rand decides to focus all of his attention and remaining resources at the Thunder Dojo  While moving into their new home  Rand asks Misty to marry him  Initially skeptical of the offer  thinking it may only be  one of those honor things   Misty accepts and reveals that she is pregnant with Rand s child  29   edit  Thunderbolts Rand is surprised one day when he finds Norman Osborn waiting for him in his office  and is then ambushed and captured by several of the Thunderbolts  Osborn uses new technology to brainwash Rand  using a mentally induced simulation in which Rand kills Wolverine  Spider Man  and Captain America but cannot bring himself to kill Luke Cage  Ghost suggests completely mind wiping Rand  but Osborn does not want him to lose his skills so he forces Rand to undergo a dangerous procedure where his mind is further tampered with  Iron Fist assists in capturing Luke Cage  who later escapes thanks to the Ghost s tampering  Iron Fist attacks Cage  who had been assisted in his escape by Ant Man  whom he had previously swallowed   and Rand makes it appear that he killed Cage  allowing the two to escape by surprise  It is later revealed that when Rand used his focused chi to punch Cage  it had cleared his warped mind  30   edit  Heroic Age In the aftermath of Siege  Rand rejoined the newly reformed New Avengers  31  While fighting a demonic invasion of New York apparently originating from the Eye of Agamotto  Iron Fist was teleported into another dimension when he came in contact with the Eye  simultaneously creating a rift on Earth that Doctor Strange claimed would mean the end of everything  32  As the Avengers battle the demons back on Earth  Iron Fist finds himself in a white void where he encounters the Ancient One  who claims that he is responsible for the current invasion due to his anger at Strange s recent  failures   33  When Iron Fist returns to Earth  now dressed in a new costume   he claims that the Ancient One has told him that Strange stole the Eye from the Ancient One rather than being given it by his master  challenging Strange to admit the truth  34  Although it is subsequently revealed that Rand was actually being manipulated by Agamotto as part of his attempt to destroy this reality  35  he retains his new costume even after Agamotto s defeat and Doctor Voodoo s sacrifice  36  After finding out that Misty s pregnancy was false  Misty and Danny decide to move out of their apartment and live separately  but continue their relationship  37   edit  Shadowland Iron Fist is amongst the heroes who battle Daredevil and the Hand  Luke Cage and Iron Fist are asked by Captain America  Iron Man and Thor to speak to Daredevil concerning the Hand s martial law imposed in Hell s Kitchen  As the former Heroes for Hire make their way to Hell s Kitchen  they witness Daredevil brutally murder Bullseye  38  Danny later has an encounter with someone who is going by the name of Power Man  He and Luke Cage discover that the Power Man is Victor Alvarez who was a survivor of the building that Bullseye blew up  39  The day after Bullseye s murder  Iron Fist and Luke Cage are discussing Murdock s actions when they are visited by the Kingpin  who comes to warn them that soon they will need to take Murdock down  Iron Fist later joins Luke Cage and the other street heroes when talking to Daredevil  When Kingpin unleashes Ghost Rider upon Shadowland  Daredevil suspects them behind Ghost Rider s attack and orders his ninjas to hunt them down  40  In the final battle for Shadowland  Iron Fist uses his chi to heal Murdock s body and soul  giving Daredevil the power to fight back against the beast inhabiting his body  41  After Shadowland  Iron Fist becomes the new Power Man s mentor and the two become a team  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Fear Itself During the Fear Itself storyline  Iron Fist and the Immortal Weapons are summoned to Beijing China to close the gates of the Eighth City that are on the verge of opening  However  Doctor Strange s prediction that Iron Fist is the problem and not the solution comes true when Danny is placed under mind control which is also creating a mystical interference with the ability of the Immortal Weapons to close the gate  He is then forced to battle his allies  including War Machine who had accompanied their group on this trip  Thanks to War Machine knocking him out  the mission is completed successfully  However  Doctor Strange realizes that Iron Fist is now an Immortal Weapon of Agamotto  42   edit  Powers and abilities Plunging his fists into the molten heart of the dragon Shou Lao the Undying infused the dragon s superhuman energy into Rand  this along with training by Lei Kung the Thunderer gave Rand the power of the Iron Fist  allowing him to summon and focus his chi  or natural energy  and enhance his natural abilities to extraordinary levels  His strength  speed  stamina  durability  agility  and reflexes and senses can all be greatly intensified  making his already formidable martial arts skills even more so  The ultimate expression of this focus is the ability to concentrate his body s natural energies into his hand  manifesting as a supernatural glow around his clenched fist  making his fist  like unto a thing of iron   So concentrated  this  iron fist  can smash into its target with superhuman hardness and impact  while his hand becomes impervious to pain and injury  However  the feat of summoning the power required leaves Rand physically and mentally drained  unable to repeat the act for a time  as long as even an entire day in certain instances  Such an ability is described as  quasi mystical   Other applications of the Iron Fist power include the ability to focus chi energy inward to heal oneself or outward to heal others of injury  as well as the ability to telepathically fuse his consciousness temporarily with another person and meld with that person s mind  In Maximum Carnage  Rand was able to use the mental application of the Iron Fist to temporarily calm a rioting mob  When asked about this by Spider Man  Rand replied that all humans are  in essence  one divine being  in a constant craving for that oneness  and once it is offered  it cannot be refused  When asked by Spider Man how long it would take to learn this  meditative technique   Rand replied   Eight or ten years   43  Orson Randall  Rand s predecessor as Iron Fist  demonstrated applications including hypnosis and channeling his chi energy into projectile weapons to increase their destructive capacity  Randall also showed enhanced resistance to injury  including resilience to poison gas dropped on his fellow combatants in the trenches of World War I  and a greatly slowed aging process  Although almost one hundred years old by the time he encountered Daniel Rand  he demonstrated physical vitality commensurate with a highly trained martial artist half his age  volume  amp  issue needed  Rand has presumably acquired powers and abilities at least equivalent to Orson Randall s though not necessarily the skill to control them thanks to combining Randall s chi energy with his own  He is also in possession of the Book of the Iron Fist  study of which will greatly expand his kung fu skills  Rand displayed what he had learned from Orson Randall regarding alternative applications of the Iron Fist when he was able to extend his chi from his fist into the electromagnetic field of the train intended to destroy K un Lun  transforming himself into  a human bullet   Despite the train being loaded down with  enough raw explosives to make Hiroshima look like a sparkler   Rand was able to destroy the train  and survive the massive explosion virtually unharmed  volume  amp  issue needed  In combat with other superhumans  he has demonstrated the ability to strike Skaar   the son of the Hulk and Caiera the Oldstrong   with enough force to at least daze Skaar  despite the latter having inherited his father s strength  44  later destroying Ragnarok   an android clone of Thor   with Spider Man throwing him at Ragnarok  45  Even without the Iron Fist  Rand is a master of all of K un Lun s martial arts and many of Earth s  In a confrontation with Tony Stark  it is revealed that Iron Fist has been registered as a lethal weapon  volume  amp  issue needed  as is supposedly required of advanced martial artists in the United States  His lawyer is present during the confrontation and argues the loophole that he is already registered with the government  and that his abilities are skill based and not power based  meaning that he does not technically qualify as a superhero and
