1937  Beginnings Childhood Walt s parents  Elias and Flora  Call  Disney Disney was born on December 5  1901  at 2156 N  Tripp Avenue in Chicago s Hermosa community area to Irish Canadian father Elias Disney and German American mother Flora Call Disney  6  7  His great grandfather  Arundel Elias Disney  had emigrated from Gowran  County Kilkenny  Ireland where he was born in 1801  Arundel Disney was a descendant of Robert d Isigny  a Frenchman who had travelled to England with William the Conqueror in 1066  8  With the d Isigny name anglicised as  Disney   the family settled in a village now known as Norton Disney  south of the city of Lincoln  in the county of Lincolnshire  In 1878  Disney s father Elias had moved from Huron County  Ontario  Canada to the United States at first seeking gold in California before finally settling down to farm with his parents near Ellis  Kansas  until 1884  Elias worked for the Union Pacific Railroad and married Flora Call on January 1  1888  in Acron  Florida  The family moved to Chicago  Illinois  in 1890  9  hometown of his brother Robert 9  who helped Elias financially for most of his early life  9  In 1906  when Walt was four  Elias and his family moved to a farm in Marceline  Missouri  10  where his brother Roy had recently purchased farmland  10  In Marceline  Disney developed his love for drawing 11  with one of the family s neighbors  a retired doctor named  Doc  Sherwood  paying him to draw pictures of Sherwood s horse  Rupert  11  His interest in trains also developed in Marceline  a town that owed its existence to the Atchison  Topeka and Santa Fe Railway which ran through it  Walt would put his ear to the tracks in anticipation of the coming train 7  then try and spot his uncle  engineer Michael Martin  conducting the train  10 year old Walt Disney  center right  at a gathering of Kansas City newsboys in 1912  The Disneys remained in Marceline for four years  12  before moving to Kansas City in 1911 13  where Walt and his younger sister Ruth attended the Benton Grammar School  At school he met Walter Pfeiffer who came from a family of theatre aficionados  and introduced Walt to the world of vaudeville and motion pictures  Before long Walt was spending more time at the Pfeiffers  than at home  14  As well as attending Saturday courses at the Kansas City Art Institute  15  Walt often took Ruth to Electric Park  15 blocks from their home  which Disney would later acknowledge as a major influence of his design of Disneyland   citation needed  Teenage years In 1917  Elias acquired shares in the O Zell jelly factory in Chicago and moved his family back to the city  16  where in the fall Disney began his freshman year at McKinley High School and took night courses at the Chicago Art Institute  17  He became the cartoonist for the school newspaper  drawing patriotic topics and focusing on World War I  Despite dropping out of high school at the age of sixteen to join the army  Disney was rejected for being underage  18  After his rejection by the army  Walt and a friend decided to join the Red Cross  19  Soon after joining he was sent to France for a year  where he drove an ambulance  but only after the armistice was signed on November 11  1918  20  Disney as an ambulance driver immediately after World War I Hoping to find work outside the Chicago O Zell factory  21  in 1919 Walt moved back to Kansas City to begin his artistic career  22  After considering whether to become an actor or a newspaper artist  he decided on a career as a newspaper artist  drawing political caricatures or comic strips  But when nobody wanted to hire him as either an artist or even as an ambulance driver  his brother Roy  then working in a local bank  got Walt a temporary job through a bank colleague at the Pesmen Rubin Art Studio 22  where he created advertisements for newspapers  magazines  and movie theaters  23  At Pesmen Rubin he met cartoonist Ubbe Iwerks 24  and when their time at the studio expired  they decided to start their own commercial company together  25  In January 1920  Disney and Iwerks formed a short lived company called   Iwerks Disney Commercial Artists   However  following a rough start  Disney left temporarily to earn money at the Kansas City Film Ad Company  and was soon joined by Iwerks who was not able to run their business alone  26  While working for the Kansas City Film Ad Company  where he made commercials based on cutout animations  Disney became interested in animation  and decided to become an animator  27  The owner of the Ad Company  A V  Cauger  allowed him to borrow a camera from work to experiment with at home  After reading the Edwin G  Lutz book Animated Cartoons  How They Are Made  Their Origin and Development  Disney considered cel animation to be much more promising than the cutout animation he was doing for Cauger  Walt eventually decided to open his own animation business  28  and recruited a fellow co worker at the Kansas City Film Ad Company  Fred Harman  as his first employee  28  Walt and Harman then secured a deal with local theater owner Frank L  Newman  arguably the most popular  showman  in the Kansas City area at the time  29  to screen their cartoons at his local theater  which they titled Laugh O Grams  29  Laugh O Gram Studio Presented as  Newman Laugh O Grams   29  Disney s cartoons became widely popular in the Kansas City area 30  and through their success  he was able to acquire his own studio  also called Laugh O Gram  31  for which he hired a vast number of additional animators  including Fred Harman s brother Hugh Harman  Rudolf Ising  and his close friend Ubbe Iwerks  32  Unfortunately  studio profits were insufficient to cover the high salaries paid to employees  Unable to successfully manage money  33  Disney s studio became loaded with debt 33  and wound up bankrupt 34  whereupon he decided to set up a studio in the movie industry s capital city  Hollywood  California  35  Hollywood Disney and his brother Roy pooled their money and set up a cartoon studio in Hollywood 36  where they needed to find a distributor for Walt s new Alice Comedies  which he had started making while in Kansas City 34  but never got to distribute  Disney sent an unfinished print to New York distributor Margaret Winkler  who promptly wrote back to him that she was keen on a distribution deal for more live action animated shorts based upon Alice s Wonderland  37  Alice Comedies Virginia Davis  the live action star of Alice s Wonderland and her family relocated from Kansas City to Hollywood at Disney s request  as did Iwerks and his family  This was the beginning of the Disney Brothers  Studio located on Hyperion Avenue in the Silver Lake district  where it remained until 1939  In 1925  Disney hired a young woman named Lillian Bounds to ink and paint celluloid  After a brief courtship  the pair married that same year  The new series  Alice Comedies  proved reasonably successful  and featured both Dawn O Day and Margie Gay as Alice with Lois Hardwick also briefly assuming the role  By the time the series ended in 1927  its focus was more on the animated characters and in particular a cat named Julius who resembled Felix the Cat  rather than the live action Alice  Oswald the Lucky Rabbit Main article  Oswald the Lucky Rabbit By 1927  Charles Mintz had married Margaret Winkler and assumed control of her business  He then ordered a new all animated series to be put into production for distribution through Universal Pictures  The new series  Oswald the Lucky Rabbit  was an almost instant success  and the character  Oswald   drawn and created by Iwerks   became a popular figure  The Disney studio expanded and Walt re hired Harman  Rudolph Ising  Carman Maxwell  and Friz Freleng from Kansas City  Disney went to New York in February 1928 to negotiate a higher fee per short and was shocked when Mintz told him that not only did he want to reduce the fee he paid Disney per short but also that he had most of his main animators  including Harman  Ising  Maxwell  and Freleng but not Iwerks  who refused to leave Disney under contract and would start his own studio if Disney did not accept the reduced production budgets  Universal  not Disney  owned the Oswald trademark  and could make the films without Walt  Disney declined Mintz s offer and as a result lost most of his animation staff whereupon he found himself on his own again  38  It subsequently took his company 78 years to get back the rights to the Oswald character when in 2006 the Walt Disney Company reacquired the rights to Oswald the Lucky Rabbit from NBC Universal  through a trade for longtime ABC sports commentator Al Michaels  39  Mickey Mouse Main article  Mickey Mouse After losing the rights to Oswald  Disney felt the need to develop a new character to replace him  which was based on a mouse he had adopted as a pet while working in his Laugh O Gram studio in Kansas City  40  Ub Iwerks reworked the sketches made by Disney to make the character easier to animate although Mickey s voice and personality were provided by Disney himself until 1947  In the words of one Disney employee   Ub designed Mickey s physical appearance  but Walt gave him his soul   40  Besides Oswald and Mickey  a similar mouse character is seen in the Alice Comedies  which featured  Ike the Mouse   Moreover  the first Flip the Frog cartoon called Fiddlesticks showed a Mickey Mouse look alike playing fiddle  The initial films were animated by Iwerks with his name prominently featured on the title cards  Originally named  Mortimer   the mouse was later re christened  Mickey  by Lillian Disney who thought that the name Mortimer did not fit  Mortimer later became the name of Mickey s rival for Minnie   taller than his renowned adversary and speaking with a Brooklyn accent  Steamboat Willie The first animated short to feature Mickey  Plane Crazy was a silent film like all of Disney s previous works  After failing to find a distributor for the short and its follow up  The Gallopin  Gaucho  Disney created a Mickey cartoon with sound called Steamboat Willie  A businessman named Pat Powers provided Disney with both distribution and Cinephone  a sound synchronization process  Steamboat Willie became an instant success  41  and Plane Crazy  The Galloping Gaucho  and all future Mickey cartoons were released with soundtracks  After the release of Steamboat Willie  Disney successfully used sound in all of his subsequent cartoons  and Cinephone also became the new distributor for Disney s early sound cartoons  42  Mickey soon eclipsed Felix the Cat as the world s most popular cartoon character 40  and by 1930  despite their having sound  cartoons featuring Felix had faded from the screen after failing to gain attention  43  Mickey s popularity would subsequently skyrocket in the early 1930s  40  Silly Symphonies Following in the footsteps of Mickey Mouse series  a series of musical shorts titled  Silly Symphonies were released in 1929  The first  The Skeleton Dance was entirely drawn and animated by Iwerks  who was also responsible for drawing the majority of cartoons released by Disney in 1928 and 1929  Although both series were successful  the Disney studio thought it was not receiving its rightful share of profits from Pat Powers  44  and in 1930  Disney signed a new distribution deal with Columbia Pictures  The original basis of the cartoons was their musical novelty with the first Silly Symphony cartoons featuring scores by Carl Stalling  45  Iwerks was soon lured by Powers into opening his own studio with an exclusive contract  while Stalling would also later leave Disney to join Iwerks  46  Iwerks launched his Flip the Frog series with the first voiced color cartoon Fiddlesticks  filmed in two strip Technicolor  Iwerks also created two other cartoon series  Willie Whopper and the Comicolor  In 1936  Iwerks shut down his studio in order to work on various projects dealing with animation technology  He would return to Disney in 1940 and go on to pioneer a number of film processes and specialized animation technologies in the studio s research and development department  By 1932  although Mickey Mouse had become a relatively popular cinema character  Silly Symphonies was not as successful  The same year also saw competition increase as Max Fleischer s flapper cartoon character  Betty Boop  gained popularity among theater audiences  47  Fleischer  considered Disney s main rival in the 1930s  48  was also the father of Richard Fleischer  whom Disney would later hire to direct his 1954 film 20 000 Leagues Under the Sea  Meanwhile  Columbia Pictures dropped the distribution of Disney cartoons to be replaced by United Artists  49  In late 1932  Herbert Kalmus  who had just completed work on the first three strip technicolor camera  50  approached Walt and convinced him to reshoot the black and white Flowers and Trees in three strip Technicolor  51 Flowers and Trees would go on to be a phenomenal success and would also win the first 1932 Academy Award for Best Short Subject  Cartoons  After the release of Flowers and Trees  all subsequent Silly Symphony cartoons were in color while Disney was also able to negotiate a two year deal with Technicolor  giving him the sole right to use their three strip process  52  53  a period eventually extended to five years  45  Through Silly Symphonies  Disney also created his most successful cartoon short of all time  The Three Little Pigs  1933   54  The cartoon ran in theaters for many months  featuring the hit song that became the anthem of the Great Depression   Who s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf   55  One of two stars dedicated to Walt Disney on the Hollywood Walk of Fame  First Academy Award In 1932  Disney received a special Academy Award for the creation of  Mickey Mouse   a series which switched to color in 1935 and soon launched spin offs for supporting characters such as Donald Duck  Goofy  and Pluto  Pluto and Donald became standalone cartoons in 1937  56  with Goofy following in 1939  57  Of all Mickey s partners  Donald Duck  who first teamed up with Mickey in the 1934 cartoon  Orphan s Benefit  was arguably the most popular  going on to become Disney s second most successful cartoon character of all time  58  Children The Disneys  first attempt at pregnancy ended when Lillian miscarried  She became pregnant again and gave birth to a daughter  Diane Marie Disney  on December 18  1933  The Disneys adopted Sharon Mae Disney  December 31  1936   February 16  1993   59  1937 1941  Golden age of animation  Disney s Folly   Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Walt Disney introduces each of the Seven Dwarfs in a scene from the original 1937 Snow White theatrical trailer  Following the creation of two cartoon series  in 1934 Disney began planning a full length feature  The following year  opinion polls showed that another cartoon series  Popeye the Sailor  produced by Max Fleischer  was more popular than Mickey Mouse  60  Nevertheless  Disney was able to put Mickey back on top as well as increase his popularity by colorizing and partially redesigning the character to become what was considered his most appealing design to date  40  When the film industry learned of Disney s plans to produce an animated feature length version of Snow White  they were certain that the endeavor would destroy the Disney Studio and dubbed the project  Disney s Folly   Both Lillian and Roy tried to talk Disney out of the project  but he continued plans for the feature  employing Chouinard Art Institute professor Don Graham to start a training operation for the studio staff  Disney then used the Silly Symphonies as a platform for experiments in realistic human animation  distinctive character animation  special effects  and the use of specialized processes and apparatus such as the multiplane camera   a new technique first used by Disney in the 1937 Silly Symphonies short The Old Mill  61  All of this development and training was used to increase quality at the studio and to ensure that the feature film would match Disney s quality expectations  Entitled Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs  the feature went into full production in 1934 and continued until mid 1937  when the studio ran out of money  To obtain the funding to complete Snow White  Disney had to show a rough cut of the motion picture to loan officers at the Bank of America  who then gave the studio the money to finish the picture  The film premiered at the Carthay Circle Theater on December 21  1937 and at its conclusion the audience gave Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs a standing ovation  Snow White  the first animated feature in America made in Technicolor  was released in February 1938 under a new distribution deal with RKO Radio Pictures  RKO had been the distributor for Disney cartoons in 1936  after it closed down the Van Beuren Studios in exchange for distribution  62  The film became the most successful motion picture of 1938 and earned over  8 million on its initial release  These initial release earnings for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs would be the equivalent of  122 487 945 in 2010  63  Golden age of animation Following the success of Snow White  for which Disney received one full size  and seven miniature Oscar statuettes  he was able to build a new campus for the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank  which opened for business on December 24  1939  Snow White was not only the peak of Disney s success  but also ushered in a period that would later be known as the Golden Age of Animation for the studio  64  65  Feature animation staff  having just completed Pinocchio  continued work on Fantasia and Bambi as well as the early production stages of Alice in Wonderland  Peter Pan and Wind in the Willows while the shorts staff carried on working on the Mickey Mouse  Donald Duck  Goofy  and Pluto cartoon series  ending the Silly Symphonies at this time  clarification needed More info needed on end of the Silly Symphonies to make a new and separate sentence   Animator Fred Moore had redesigned Mickey Mouse in the late 1930s after Donald Duck overtook him in popularity among theater audiences  66  Pinocchio and Fantasia followed Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs into the movie theaters in 1940  but both proved financial disappointments  The inexpensive Dumbo was then planned as an income generator  but during production most of the animation staff went on strike  permanently straining relations between Disney and his artists  1941 1945  World War II era In 1941  the U S  State Department sent Disney and a group of animators to South America as part of its Good Neighbor policy  at the same time guaranteeing financing for the resultant movie  Saludos Amigos  67  Shortly after the release of Dumbo in October 1941  the United States entered World War II  The U S  Army and Navy Bureau of Aeronautics 68  contracted most of the Disney studio s facilities where the staff created training and instruction films for the military  home front morale boosting shorts such as Der Fuehrer s Face and the 1943 feature film Victory Through Air Power  However  military films did not generate income  and the feature film Bambi underperformed on its release in April 1942  Disney successfully re issued Snow White in 1944  establishing a seven year re release tradition for his features  In 1945  The Three Caballeros was the last animated feature released by the studio during the war  In 1944  Encyclop dia Britannica publisher William Benton  entered into unsuccessful negotiations with Disney to make six to twelve educational films per annum  Disney was asked by the US Coordinator of Inter American Affairs  Office of Inter American Affairs  OIAA   to make an educational film about the Amazon Basin  which resulted in the 1944 animated short  The Amazon Awakens  69  70  71  72  73  1945 1955  Post war period Disney studios also created inexpensive package films  containing collections of cartoon shorts  and issued them to theaters during this period  These included Make Mine Music  1946   Melody Time  1948   Fun and Fancy Free  1947  and The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr  Toad  1949   The latter had only two sections  the first based on The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame  and the second on The Legend of Sleepy Hollow by Washington Irving  During this period  Disney also ventured into full length dramatic films that mixed live action and animated scenes  including Song of the South and So Dear to My Heart  After the war ended  Mickey s popularity would also fade  74  By the late 1940s  the studio had recovered enough to continue production on the full length features Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan  both of which had been shelved during the war years  Work also began on Cinderella  which became Disney s most successful film since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs  In 1948 the studio also initiated a series of live action nature films  titled True Life Adventures  with On Seal Island the first  Despite its resounding success with feature films  the studio s animation shorts were no longer as popular as they once were  with people paying more attention to Warner Bros  and their animation star Bugs Bunny  By 1942  Leon Schlesinger Productions  which produced the Warner Bros  cartoons  had become the country s most popular animation studio  75  However  while Bugs Bunny s popularity rose in the 1940s  so did Donald Duck s  76  a character who would replace Mickey Mouse as Disney s star character by 1949  77  During the mid 1950s  Disney produced a number of educational films on the space program in collaboration with NASA rocket designer Wernher von Braun  Man in Space and Man and the Moon in 1955  and Mars and Beyond in 1957  Walt Disney meets Wernher von Braun in 1954  Testimony before Congress Disney was a founding member of the anti communist Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals   In 1947  during the early years of the Cold War  78  Disney testified before the House Un American Activities Committee  HUAC   where he branded Herbert Sorrell  David Hilberman and William Pomerance  former animators and labor union organizers  Communist agitators  All three men denied the allegations and Sorrell went on to testify before the HUAC in 1946 when insufficient evidence was found to link him to the Communist Party  79  80  Disney also accused the Screen Cartoonists Guild of being a Communist front  and charged that the 1941 strike was part of an organized Communist effort to gain influence in Hollywood  78  1955 1966  Theme parks and beyond Planning Disneyland Disneyland  aerial view  August 1963  looking SE  New Melodyland Theater at top  Santa Ana Freeway  US 101 at the time  now I 5  upper left corner  On a business trip to Chicago in the late 1940s  Disney drew sketches of his ideas for an amusement park where he envisioned his employees spending time with their children  The idea for a children s theme park came after a visit to Children s Fairyland in Oakland  California  It also said that Disney may have been inspired to create Disneyland in the park Republic of the Children located in Manuel B  Gonnet  La Plata  Argentina  and opened in 1951  81  This plan was originally intended to be built on a plot located across the street to the south of the studio  These original ideas developed into a concept for a larger enterprise that would become Disneyland  Disney spent five years developing Disneyland and created a new subsidiary company  WED Enterprises  to carry out planning and production of the park  A small group of Disney studio employees joined the Disneyland development project as engineers and planners  and were dubbed Imagineers  citation needed  As Disney explained one of his earliest plans to Herb Ryman  who created the first aerial drawing of Disneyland presented to the Bank of America during fund raising for the project  he said   Herbie  I just want it to look like nothing else in the world  And it should be surrounded by a train   82  Entertaining his daughters and their friends in his backyard and taking them for rides on his Carolwood Pacific Railroad had inspired Disney to include a railroad in the plans for Disneyland  Disneyland grand opening Walt Disney giving the dedication day speech July 17  1955  Disneyland officially opened on July 18  1955  On Sunday  July 17  1955  Disneyland hosted a live TV preview  among the thousands of people in attendance were Ronald Reagan  Bob Cummings and Art Linkletter  who shared cohosting duties  as well as the mayor of Anaheim  Walt gave the following dedication day speech    To all who come to this happy place  welcome  Disneyland is your land  Here age relives fond memories of the past      and here youth may savor the challenge and promise of the future  Disneyland is dedicated to the ideals  the dreams and the hard facts that have created America     with the hope that it will be a source of joy and inspiration to all the world    Carolwood Pacific Railroad The Lilly Belle on display at Disneyland Main Station in 1993  The caboose s woodwork was done entirely by Walt himself  Main article  Carolwood Pacific Railroad During 1949  Disney and his family moved to a new home on a large piece of land in the Holmby Hills district of Los Angeles  California  With the help of his friends Ward and Betty Kimball  who already had their own backyard railroad  Disney developed blueprints and immediately set to work on creating a miniature live steam railroad for his backyard  The name of the railroad  Carolwood Pacific Railroad  came from his home s location on Carolwood Drive  The railroad s half mile long layout included a 46 foot  14 m  long trestle bridge  loops  overpasses  gradients  an elevated berm  and a 90 foot  27 m  tunnel underneath his wife s flowerbed  He named the miniature working steam locomotive built by Disney Studios engineer Roger E  Broggie Lilly Belle in his wife s honor and had his attorney draw up right of way papers giving the railroad a permanent  legal easement through the garden areas  which his wife dutifully signed  however  there is no evidence of the documents ever recorded as a restriction on the property s title  clarification needed  Expansion into new areas As Walt Disney Productions began work on Disneyland  it also began expanding its other entertainment operations  In 1950  Treasure Island became the studio s first all live action feature  soon followed by 20 000 Leagues Under the Sea  in CinemaScope  1954   Old Yeller  1957   The Shaggy Dog  1959   Pollyanna  1960   Swiss Family Robinson  1960   The Absent Minded Professor  1961   and The Parent Trap  1961   The studio produced its first TV special  One Hour in Wonderland  in 1950  Disney began hosting a weekly anthology series on ABC entitled Disneyland  after the park  on which he aired clips of past Disney productions  gave tours of his studio  and familiarized the public with Disneyland as it was being constructed in Anaheim  The show also featured a Davy Crockett miniseries  which started the  Davy Crockett craze  among American youth  during which millions of coonskin caps and other Crockett memorabilia were sold across the country  83  In 1955  the studio s first daily television show  Mickey Mouse Club debuted on ABC  It was a groundbreaking comedy variety show aimed specifically for children  Disney took a strong personal interest in the show and even returned to the animation studio to voice Mickey Mouse in its animated segments during its original 1955 59 production run  The Mickey Mouse Club would continue in various incarnations in syndication and on the Disney Channel into the 1990s  As the studio expanded and diversified into other media  Disney devoted less of his attention to the animation department  entrusting most of its operations to his key animators  whom he dubbed the Nine Old Men  Although he was spending less time supervising the production of the animated films  he was always present at story meetings  84  During Disney s lifetime  the animation department created the successful Lady and the Tramp   the first animated film in CinemaScope  in 1955  Sleeping Beauty   the first animated film in Super Technirama 70mm  in 1959  One Hundred and One Dalmatians  the first animated feature film to use Xerox cels  in 1961  and The Sword in the Stone in 1963  Production of short cartoons kept pace until 1956  when Disney shut down the responsible division although special shorts projects would continue for the remainder of the studio s duration on an irregular basis  These productions were all distributed by Disney s new subsidiary  Buena Vista Distribution  which had taken over all distribution duties for Disney films from RKO by 1955  Disneyland  one of the world s first theme parks  finally opened on July 17  1955  and was immediately successful  Visitors from around the world came to visit Disneyland  which contained attractions based on a number of successful Disney characters and films  After 1955  the Disneyland TV show was renamed Walt Disney Presents  It switched from black and white to color in 1961 and changed its name to Walt Disney s Wonderful World of Color  at the same time moving from ABC to NBC  85  and eventually evolving into its current form as The Wonderful World of Disney  The series continued to air on NBC until 1981  when it was picked up by CBS  86  Since then  it has aired on ABC  NBC  the Hallmark Channel and the Cartoon Network via separate broadcast rights deals  During its run  the Disney series offered some recurring characters  such as the newspaper reporter and sleuth  Gallegher  played by Roger Mobley with a plot based on the writings of Richard Harding Davis  Disney had already formed his own music publishing division in 1949 and in 1956  partly inspired by the huge success of the television theme song The Ballad of Davy Crockett  he created a company owned record production and distribution entity called Disneyland Records  Early 1960s successes  Left to right  Robert B  Sherman  Richard M  Sherman and Walt Disney sing  There s a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow   1964  By the early 1960s  the Disney empire had become a major success  and Walt Disney Productions had established itself as the world s leading producer of family entertainment  Walt Disney was the Head of Pageantry for the 1960 Winter Olympics  After decades of pursuit  Disney finally acquired the rights to P L  Travers  books about a magical nanny  Mary Poppins  released in 1964  was the most successful Disney film of the 1960s and featured a memorable song score written by Disney favorites  the Sherman Brothers  The same year  Disney debuted a number of exhibits at the 1964 New York World s Fair  including Audio Animatronic figures  all of which were later integrated into attractions at Disneyland and a new theme park project which was to be established on the East Coast  Although the studio would probably have proved major competition for Hanna Barbera  Disney decided not to enter the race and mimic Hanna Barbera by producing Saturday morning TV cartoon series  With the expansion of Disney s empire and constant production of feature films  the financial burden involved in such a move would have proven too great  Plans for Disney World and EPCOT In early 1964  Disney announced plans to develop another theme park to be called Disney World a few miles west of Orlando  Florida  Disney World was to include  the Magic Kingdom   a larger  more elaborate version of Disneyland  It would also feature a number of golf courses and resort hotels  The heart of Disney World  however  was to be the Experimental Prototype City  or Community  of Tomorrow  known as EPCOT for short  Mineral King Ski Resort During the early to mid 1960s  Walt Disney developed plans for a ski resort in Mineral King  a glacial valley in California s Sierra Nevada mountain range  He brought in experts such as the renowned Olympic ski coach and ski area designer Willy Schaeffler  who helped plan a visitor village  ski runs and ski lifts among the several bowls surrounding the valley  Plans finally moved into action in the mid 1960s  but Walt died before the actual work started  Disney s death and opposition from conservationists ensured that the resort was never built  Death Like many people of the time  Walt Disney was a smoker his entire adult life  although he made sure he was not seen smoking around children  87  In 1966  Disney was scheduled to undergo surgery to repair an old neck injury 88  caused by many years of playing polo at the Riviera Club in Hollywood  89  On November 2  during pre operative X rays  doctors at Providence St  Joseph Medical Center  across the street from the Disney Studio  discovered a tumor in his left lung  90  Five days later a biopsy showed the tumor to be malignant and to have spread throughout the entire left lung  90  After removal of the lung  doctors informed Disney that his life expectancy was six months to two years  90  After several chemotherapy sessions  Disney and his wife spent a short amount of time in Palm Springs  California  88  On November 30  Disney collapsed at his home  He was revived by fire department personnel and rushed to St  Joseph s where on December 15  1966  at 9 30 a m   ten days after his 65th birthday  Disney died of acute circulatory collapse  caused by lung cancer  88  The last thing he reportedly wrote before his death was the name of actor Kurt Russell  the significance of which remains a mystery  even to Russell  91  Roy O  Disney continued out with the Florida project  insisting that the name be changed to Walt Disney World in honor of his brother  The final productions in which Disney played an active role were the animated feature The Jungle Book and the animated short Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day  as well as the live action musical feature The Happiest Millionaire  all released in 1967  Songwriter Robert B  Sherman recalled of the last time he saw Disney    He was up in the third floor of the animation building after a run through of The Happiest Millionaire  He usually held court in the hallway afterward for the people involved with the picture  And he started talking to them  telling them what he liked and what they should change  and then  when they were through  he turned to us and with a big smile  he said   Keep up the good work  boys   And he walked to his office  It was the last we ever saw of him  92    Hibernation Urban Legend A long standing urban legend maintains that Disney was cryogenically frozen  and his frozen corpse stored beneath the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland  93  In fact  Disney was cremated on December 17  1966  and his ashes interred at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale  California  The first known human cryogenic freezing did not occur until January 1967  more than a month after Disney s death  93  According to  at least one Disney publicist   as reported in the French magazine Ici Paris in 1969  the source of the rumor was a group of Disney Studio animators with  a bizarre sense of humor  who were playing a final prank on their late boss  94  Although the rumor is acknowledged as false by most historians  Robert Mosley  in Disney s World  1986   and Marc Eliot  in Walt Disney   Hollywood s Dark Prince  1993   argue that Disney may have known of cryonics and may have had an interest in the science  95  However his daughter Diane wrote in 1972   There is absolutely no truth to the rumor that my father  Walt Disney  wished to be frozen  I doubt that my father had ever heard of cryonics   94  Legacy  1967 present Continuing Disney Productions Plaque at the entrance that embodies the intended spirit of Disneyland by Walt Disney  to leave reality and enter fantasy After Walt Disney s death  Roy Disney returned from retirement to take full control of Walt Disney Productions and WED Enterprises  In October 1971  the families of Walt and Roy met in front of Cinderella Castle at the Magic Kingdom to officially open the Walt Disney World Resort  After giving his dedication for Walt Disney World  Roy asked Lillian Disney to join him  As the orchestra played  When You Wish Upon a Star   she stepped up to the podium accompanied by Mickey Mouse  He then said   Lilly  you knew all of Walt s ideas and hopes as well as anybody  what would Walt think of it  Walt Disney World      I think Walt would have approved   she replied  96  Roy died from a cerebral hemorrhage on December 20  1971  the day he was due to open the Disneyland Christmas parade  1968 US postage stamp During the second phase of the  Walt Disney World  theme park  EPCOT was translated by Disney s successors into EPCOT Center  which opened in 1982  As it currently exists  EPCOT is essentially a living world s fair  different from the actual functional city that Disney had envisioned  In 1992  Walt Disney Imagineering took the step closer to Disney s original ideas and dedicated Celebration  Florida  a town built by the Walt Disney Company adjacent to Walt Disney World  that hearkens back to the spirit of EPCOT  EPCOT was also originally intended to be devoid of Disney characters which initially limited the appeal of the park to young children  However  the company later changed this policy and Disney characters can now be found throughout the park  often dressed in costumes reflecting the different pavilions  The Disney entertainment empire Today  Walt Disney s animation motion picture studios and theme parks have developed into a multi billion dollar television  motion picture  vacation destination and media corporation that carry his name  Among other assets The Walt Disney Company owns five vacation resorts  eleven theme parks  two water parks  thirty nine hotels  eight motion picture studios  six record labels  eleven cable television networks  and one terrestrial television network  As of 2007  the company had annual revenues of over U S   35 billion  97  Disney Animation Walt Disney was a pioneer in character animation  He was one of the first people to move away from basic cartoons with just  impossible outlandish gags  and crudely drawn characters to an art form with heartwarming stories and characters the audience can connect to on an emotional level  The personality displayed in the characters of his films and the technological advancements remain influential when animating today  He was also considered by many of his colleagues to be a master storyteller and the animation department did not fully recover from his demise until the late 1980s in a period known as the Disney Renaissance  The most financially and critically successful films produced during this time include Who Framed Roger Rabbit  1988   The Little Mermaid  1989   Beauty and the Beast  1991   Aladdin  1992  and The Lion King  1994   In 1995  Walt Disney Pictures distributed Pixar s Toy Story  the first computer animated feature film  Walt Disney s nephew Roy E  Disney claimed that Walt would have loved Toy Story and that it was  his kind of movie   98  With the rise of computer animated films a stream of financially unsuccessful Traditional hand drawn animated features in the early years of the 2000s  decade  emerged  This led to the company s controversial decision to close the traditional animation department  The two satellite studios in Paris and Orlando were closed  and the main studio in Burbank was converted to a computer animation production facility  firing hundreds of people in the process  In 2004  Disney released what was announced as their final  traditionally animated  feature film  Home on the Range  However  since the 2006 acquisition of Pixar  and the resulting rise of John Lasseter to Chief Creative Officer  that position has changed with the largely successful 2009 film The Princess and the Frog  This marked Disney s return to traditional hand drawn animation and the studio hired back staff who had been laid off in the past  Today  Disney produces both traditional and computer animation  CalArts In his later years  Disney devoted substantial time to funding The California Institute of the Arts  CalArts   Formed in 1961 through a merger of the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music and the Chouinard Art Institute  which had helped in the training of the animation staff during the 1930s  when Disney died  one fourth of his estate went to CalArts  which helped in building its campus  In his will  Disney paved the way for the creation of several charitable trusts which included one for the California Institute of the Arts and other for the Disney Foundation  99  He also donated 38 acres  0 154 km2  of the Golden Oaks ranch in Valencia for construction of the school  CalArts moved onto the Valencia campus in 1972  In an early admissions bulletin  Disney explained    A hundred years ago  Wagner conceived of a perfect and all embracing art  combining music  drama  painting  and the dance  but in his wildest imagination he had no hint what infinite possibilities were to become commonplace through the invention of recording  radio  cinema and television  There already have been geniuses combining the arts in the mass communications media  and they have already given us powerful new art forms  The future holds bright promise for those who imaginations are trained to play on the vast orchestra of the art in combination  Such supermen will appear most certainly in those environments which provide contact with all the arts  but even those who devote themselves to a single phase of art will benefit from broadened horizons  100    Walt Disney Family Museum In 2009  the Walt Disney Family Museum opened in the Presidio of San Francisco  Thousands of artifacts from Disney s life and career are on display  including 248 awards that he received  101  Antisemitism accusations Disney was long rumored to be antisemitic during his lifetime  and such rumors have persisted after his death  Indeed  in the 1930s he welcomed German filmmaker and Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl to Hollywood  102  Disney biographer Neal Gabler  the first writer to gain unrestricted access to the Disney archives  concluded in 2006 that available evidence does not support such accusations  In a CBS interview Gabler summarized his findings    That s one of the questions everybody asks me    My answer to that is  not in the conventional sense that we think of someone as being an antisemite  But he got the reputation because  in the 1940s  he got himself allied with a group called the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals  which was an anti Communist and antisemitic organization  And though Walt himself  in my estimation  was not antisemitic  nevertheless  he willingly allied himself with people who were antisemitic  and that reputation stuck  He was never really able to expunge it throughout his life  103    Disney eventually distanced himself from the Motion Picture Alliance in the 1950s  104  The Walt Disney Family Museum acknowledges that Disney did have  difficult relationships  with some Jewish individuals  and that ethnic stereotypes common to films of the 1930s were included in some early cartoons  such as Three Little Pigs and The Opry House  However  the museum points out that Disney employed Jews throughout his career  donated to several Jewish charities  The Hebrew Orphan Asylum  Yeshiva College  Jewish Home for the Aged  The American League for a Free Palestine  104  and was named  1955 Man of the Year  by the B nai B rith chapter in Beverly Hills  104  105  Academy Awards This display case in the
