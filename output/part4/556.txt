Law of the United States From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search The United States Constitution  the supreme law of the United States The United States Code  the codification of federal statutory law The Code of Federal Regulations  the codification of federal administrative law The United States Reports  the official reporter of the Supreme Court of the United States The law of the United States consists of many levels 1  of codified and uncodified forms of law  of which the most important is the United States Constitution  the foundation of the federal government of the United States  The Constitution sets out the boundaries of federal law  which consists of constitutional acts of Congress  constitutional treaties ratified by Congress  constitutional regulations promulgated by the executive branch  and case law originating from the federal judiciary  The Constitution and federal law are the supreme law of the land  thus preempting conflicting state and territorial laws in the fifty U S  states and in the territories  2  However  the scope of federal preemption is limited  because the scope of federal power is itself rather limited  In the unique dual sovereign system of American federalism  actually tripartite 3  when one includes Indian reservations   states are the plenary sovereigns  while the federal sovereign possesses only the limited supreme authority enumerated in the Constitution  4  Indeed  states may grant their citizens broader rights than the federal Constitution as long as they do not infringe on any federal constitutional rights  5  6  Thus  most U S  law  especially the actual  living law  of contract  tort  criminal  and family law experienced by the majority of citizens on a day to day basis  consists primarily of state law  which can and does vary greatly from one state to the next  7  8  At both the federal and state levels  the law of the United States was originally largely derived from the common law system of English law  which was in force at the time of the Revolutionary War  9  10  However  U S  law has diverged greatly from its English ancestor both in terms of substance and procedure  and has incorporated a number of civil law innovations  Contents 1 General overview 1 1 Sources of law 1 2 Constitutionality 2 American common law 3 Levels of law 3 1 Federal law 3 1 1 Federal statutory

sources are constitutional law  statutory law  administrative regulations  and the common law  which includes case law   11  The most important source of law is the United States Constitution  All other law falls under and are subordinate to that document  No law may contradict the Constitution    edit  Constitutionality Where Congress enacts a statute that conflicts with the Constitution  the Supreme Court may find that law unconstitutional and declare it invalid  12  Notably  a statute does not disappear automatically merely because it has been found unconstitutional  it must be deleted by a subsequent statute  Many federal and state statutes have remained on the books for decades after they were ruled to be unconstitutional  However  under the principle of stare decisis  no sensible lower court will enforce an unconstitutional statute  and any court that does so will be reversed by the Supreme Court  Conversely  any court that refuses to enforce a constitutional statute  where such constitutionality has been expressly established in prior cases  will risk reversal by the Supreme Court  13  14   edit  American common law The United States and most Commonwealth countries are heirs to the common law legal tradition of English law  15  Certain practices traditionally allowed under English common law were expressly outlawed by the Constitution  such as bills of attainder 16  and general search warrants  17  As common law courts  U S  courts have inherited the principle of stare decisis  18  American judges  like common law judges elsewhere  not only apply the law  they also make the law  to the extent that their decisions in the cases before them become precedent for decisions in future cases  19  The actual substance of English law was formally  received  into the United States in several ways  First  all U S  states except Louisiana have enacted  reception statutes  which generally state that the common law of England  particularly judge made law  is the law of the state to the extent that it is not repugnant to domestic law or indigenous conditions  20  Some reception statutes impose a specific cutoff date for reception  such as the date of a colony s founding  while others are deliberately vague  21  Thus  contemporary U S  courts often cite pre Revolution cases when discussing the evolution of an ancient judge made common law principle into its modern form  21  such as the heightened duty of care traditionally imposed upon common carriers  22  Second  a small number of important British statutes in effect at the time of the Revolution have been independently reenacted by U S  states  Two examples that many lawyers will recognize are the Statute of Frauds  still widely known in the U S  by that name  and the Statute of 13 Elizabeth  the ancestor of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act   Such English statutes are still regularly cited in contemporary American cases interpreting their modern American descendants  23  However  it is important to understand that despite the presence of reception statutes  much of contemporary American common law has diverged significantly from English common law  24  The reason is that although the courts of the various Commonwealth nations are often influenced by each other s rulings  American courts rarely follow post Revolution Commonwealth rulings unless there is no American ruling on point  the facts and law at issue are nearly identical  and the reasoning is strongly persuasive  Early on  American courts  even after the Revolution  often did cite contemporary English cases  This was because appellate decisions from many American courts were not regularly reported until the mid 19th century  lawyers and judges  as creatures of habit  used English legal materials to fill the gap  25  But citations to English decisions gradually disappeared during the 19th century as American courts developed their own principles to resolve the legal problems of the American people  26  The number of published volumes of American reports soared from eighteen in 1810 to over 8 000 by 1910  27  By 1879  one of the delegates to the California constitutional convention was already complaining   Now  when we require them to state the reasons for a decision  we do not mean they shall write a hundred pages of detail  We  do  not mean that they shall include the small cases  and impose on the country all this fine judicial literature  for the Lord knows we have got enough of that already   28  Today  in the words of Stanford law professor Lawrence Friedman   American cases rarely cite foreign materials  Courts occasionally cite a British classic or two  a famous old case  or a nod to Blackstone  but current British law almost never gets any mention   29  Foreign law has never been cited as binding precedent  but merely as a reflection of the shared values of Anglo American civilization or even Western civilization in general  30   edit  Levels of law  edit  Federal law Federal law originates with the Constitution  which gives Congress the power to enact statutes for certain limited purposes like regulating interstate commerce  Nearly all statutes have been codified in the United States Code  Many statutes give executive branch agencies the power to create regulations  which are published in the Federal Register and codified into the Code of Federal Regulations  Regulations generally also carry the force of law under the Chevron doctrine  Many lawsuits turn on the meaning of a federal statute or regulation  and judicial interpretations of such meaning carry legal force under the principle of stare decisis  In the beginning  federal law traditionally focused on areas where there was an express grant of power to the federal government in the federal Constitution  like the military  money  foreign affairs  especially international treaties   tariffs  intellectual property  specifically patents and copyrights   and mail  Since the start of the 20th century  aggressive interpretations of the Commerce and Spending Clauses of the Constitution have enabled federal law to expand into areas like aviation  telecommunications  railroads  pharmaceuticals  antitrust  and trademarks  In some areas  like aviation and railroads  the federal government has developed a comprehensive scheme that preempts virtually all state law  while in others  like family law  a relatively small number of federal statutes  generally covering interstate and international situations  interacts with a much larger body of state law  In areas like antitrust  trademark  and employment law  there are powerful laws at both the federal and state levels that coexist with each other  In a handful of areas like insurance  Congress has enacted laws expressly refusing to regulate them as long as the states have laws regulating them  see  e g   the McCarran Ferguson Act   Under the doctrine of Erie Railroad Co  v  Tompkins  1938   there is no general federal common law  Although federal courts can create federal common law in the form of case law  such law must be linked one way or another to the interpretation of a particular federal constitutional provision  statute  or regulation  which in turn was enacted as part of the Constitution or after   Federal courts lack the plenary power possessed by state courts to simply make up law  which the latter are able to do in the absence of constitutional or statutory provisions replacing the common law  Only in a few narrow limited areas  like maritime law  31  has the Constitution expressly authorized the continuation of English common law at the federal level  meaning that in those areas federal courts can continue to make law as they see fit  subject to the limitations of stare decisis   The other major implication of the Erie doctrine is that federal courts cannot dictate the content of state law when there is no federal issue  and thus no federal supremacy issue  in a case  When hearing claims under state law pursuant to diversity jurisdiction  federal trial courts must apply the statutory and decisional law of the state in which they sit  as if they were a court of that state  32  even if they believe that the relevant state law is irrational or just bad public policy  33  And under Erie  deference is one way only  state courts are not bound by federal interpretations of state law  34  If this was not confusing enough  state courts are not bound to follow judicial interpretations of federal law from the federal courts that sit in a state  including federal courts of appeals and district courts  that is  the intermediate appellate courts and trial courts   35  There is only one federal court that binds all state courts as to the interpretation of federal law and the federal Constitution  the U S  Supreme Court itself  36   edit  Federal statutory enactment and codification Main articles  United States Statutes at Large and United States Code After the President signs a bill into law  or Congress enacts it over his veto   it is delivered to the Office of the Federal Register  OFR  of the National Archives and Records Administration  NARA  where it is assigned a law number  and prepared for publication as a slip law  37  Public laws  but not private laws  are also given legal statutory citation by the OFR  At the end of each session of Congress  the slip laws are compiled into bound volumes called the Statutes at Large  and they are known as session laws  The Statutes at Large present a chronological arrangement of the laws in the exact order that they have been enacted  Public laws are incorporated into the United States Code  which is a codification of all general and permanent laws of the United States  The main edition is published every six years by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives  and cumulative supplements are published annually  38  39  The U S  Code is arranged by subject matter  and it shows the present status of laws with amendments already incorporated in the text that have been amended on one or more occasions   edit  Federal regulatory promulgation and codification Main articles  Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations Congress often enacts statutes that grant broad rulemaking authority to federal agencies  Often  Congress is simply too gridlocked to draft detailed statutes that explain how the agency should react to every possible situation  or Congress believes the agency s technical specialists are best equipped to deal with particular fact situations as they arise  Therefore  federal agencies are authorized to promulgate regulations  Under the principle of Chevron deference  regulations normally carry the force of law as long as they are based on a reasonable interpretation of the relevant statutes  Regulations are adopted pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act  Regulations are first proposed and published in the Federal Register  FR or Fed  Reg   and subject to a public comment period  Eventually  after a period for public comment and revisions based on comments received  a final version is published in the Federal Register  The regulations are codified and incorporated into the Code of Federal Regulations  CFR  which is published once a year on a rolling schedule  Besides regulations formally promulgated under the APA  federal agencies also frequently promulgate an enormous amount of forms  manuals  policy statements  letters  and rulings  These documents may be considered by a court as persuasive authority as to how a particular statute or regulation may be interpreted  but are not entitled to Chevron deference   edit  Formulation of federal precedent Unlike the states  there is no plenary reception statute at the federal level that continued the common law and thereby granted federal courts the power to formulate legal precedent like their English predecessors  Federal courts are solely creatures of the federal Constitution and the federal Judiciary Acts  40  However  it is universally accepted that the Founding Fathers of the United States  by vesting  judicial power  into the Supreme Court and the inferior federal courts in Article Three of the United States Constitution  thereby vested in them the implied judicial power of common law courts to formulate persuasive precedent  this power was widely accepted  understood  and recognized by the Founding Fathers at the time the Constitution was ratified  41  Several legal scholars have argued that the federal judicial power to decide  cases or controversies  necessarily includes the power to decide the precedential effect of those cases and controversies  42  The difficult question is whether federal judicial power extends to formulating binding precedent through strict adherence to the rule of stare decisis  This is where the act of deciding a case becomes a limited form of lawmaking in itself  in that an appellate court s rulings will thereby bind itself and lower courts in future cases  and therefore also impliedly binds all persons within the court s jurisdiction   Prior to a major change to federal court rules in 2007  about one fifth of federal appellate cases were published and thereby became binding precedents  while the rest were unpublished and bound only the parties to each case  41  As Judge Alex Kozinski has explained  binding precedent as we know it today simply did not exist at the time the Constitution was framed  41  Judicial decisions were not consistently  accurately  and faithfully reported on both sides of the Atlantic  reporters often simply rewrote or failed to publish decisions which they disliked   and the United Kingdom lacked a coherent court hierarchy prior to the end of the 19th century  41  Furthermore  English judges in the eighteenth century subscribed to now obsolete natural law theories of law  by which law was believed to have an existence independent of what individual judges said  They saw themselves as merely declaring the law which had always theoretically existed  not making it  41  Therefore  a judge could reject another judge s opinion as simply an incorrect statement of the law  like how scientists regularly reject each other s conclusions as incorrect statements of the laws of science  41  The contemporary rule of binding precedent became possible in the U S  in the nineteenth century only after the creation of a clear court hierarchy  under the Judiciary Acts   and the beginning of regular verbatim publication of U S  appellate decisions by West Publishing  41  It gradually developed case by case as an extension of the judiciary s public policy of effective judicial administration  that is  in order to efficiently exercise the judicial power   41  It is generally justified today as a matter of public policy  first  as a matter of fundamental fairness  and second  that in the absence of case law  it would be completely unworkable for every minor issue in every legal case to be briefed  argued  and decided from first principles  such as relevant statutes  constitutional provisions  and underlying public policies   which in turn would create hopeless inefficiency  instability  and unpredictability  and thereby undermine the rule of law  43  44  Here is a typical exposition of that public policy in a 2008 majority opinion signed by Associate Justice Stephen Breyer    Justice Brandeis once observed that  in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right   Burnet v  Coronado Oil  amp  Gas Co   285 U S  393  406  1932   dissenting opinion   To overturn a decision settling one such matter simply because we might believe that decision is no longer  right  would inevitably reflect a willingness to reconsider others  And that willingness could itself threaten to substitute disruption  confusion  and uncertainty for necessary legal stability  We have not found here any factors that might overcome these considerations  45    However  since precedents became binding  it is now sometimes possible  over time  for a line of them to drift away from the express language of any underlying statutory or constitutional texts  until such texts are severely overloaded with implied meanings not even hinted at on their face  This tendency towards so called judicial lawmaking has been particularly obvious in federal substantive due process decisions  Due to obvious tension with the reservation of legislative power to Congress in Article One of the United States Constitution  it is often subject to harsh criticism as  antidemocratic  from originalists such as Associate Justice Antonin Scalia  as in this 2000 dissenting opinion    In imposing its Court made code upon the States  the original opinion at least asserted that it was demanded by the Constitution  Today s decision does not pretend that it is and yet still asserts the right to impose it against the will of the people s representatives in Congress  Far from believing that stare decisis compels this result  I believe we cannot allow to remain on the books even a celebrated decision especially a celebrated decision that has come to stand for the proposition that the Supreme Court has power to impose extraconstitutional constraints upon Congress and the States  This is not the system that was established by the Framers  or that would be established by any sane supporter of government by the people  46     edit  State law Volumes of the Thomson West annotated version of the California Penal Code  the codification of criminal law in the state of California The Restatement  Second  of Torts  a highly influential restatement of United States tort law The fifty American states are separate sovereigns with their own state constitutions  state governments  and state courts  including state supreme courts   47  They retain plenary power to make laws covering anything not preempted by the federal Constitution  federal statutes  or international treaties ratified by the federal Senate  Normally  state supreme courts are the final interpreters of state constitutions and state law  unless their interpretation itself presents a federal issue  in which case a decision may be appealed to the U S  Supreme Court by way of a petition for writ of certiorari  48  Most cases are litigated in state courts and involve claims and defenses under state laws  Each year  only about 280 000 civil and criminal cases are heard in federal courts  as opposed to 27 5 million civil and criminal cases in state courts  these numbers exclude 858 000 federal bankruptcy cases  and in state courts  4 5 million domestic  1 7 million juvenile  and 55 million traffic cases   49  The law of most of the states is based on the common law of England  the notable exception is Louisiana  whose civil law is largely based upon French and Spanish law  The passage of time has led to state courts and legislatures expanding  overruling  or modifying the common law  as a result  the laws of any given state invariably differ from the laws of its sister states  All states have a legislative branch which enacts state statutes  an executive branch that promulgates state regulations pursuant to statutory authorization  and a judicial branch that applies  interprets  and occasionally overturns both state statutes and regulations  as well as local ordinances  All states have codified some or all of their statutory law into legal codes  Codification was an idea borrowed from the civil law through the efforts of American lawyer David Dudley Field  50 New York s codes are known as  Laws   California and Texas simply call them  Codes   Other states use terms such as  Revised Statutes  or  Compiled Statutes  for their compilations  California  New York  and Texas have separate subject specific codes  while all other states and the federal government use a single code divided into numbered titles  In some states  codification is often treated as a mere restatement of the common law  to the extent that the subject matter of the particular statute at issue was covered by some judge made principle at common law  Judges are free to liberally interpret the codes unless and until their interpretations are specifically overridden by the legislature  51  In other states  there is a tradition of strict adherence to the plain text of the codes  The advantage of codification is that once the state legislature becomes accustomed to writing new laws as amendments to an existing code  the code will usually reflect democratic sentiment as to what the current law is  though the entire state of the law must always be ascertained by reviewing case law to determine how judges have interpreted a particular codified statute   In contrast  in jurisdictions with uncodified statutes  like the United Kingdom  determining what the law is can be a more difficult process  One has to trace back to the earliest relevant Act of Parliament  and then identify all later Acts which amended the earlier Act  or which directly overrode it  For example  when the UK decided to create a Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  lawmakers had to identify every single Act referring to the House of Lords that was still good law  and then amend all of those laws to refer to the Supreme Court  52   edit  Attempts at  uniform  laws Efforts by various organizations to create  uniform  state laws have been only partially successful  The two leading organizations are the American Law Institute  ALI  and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws  NCCUSL   The most successful and influential uniform laws are the Uniform Commercial Code  a joint ALI NCCUSL project  and the Model Penal Code  from ALI   Apart from model codes  the American Law Institute has also created Restatements of the Law which are widely used by lawyers and judges to simplify the task of summarizing the current status of the common law  Instead of listing long  tedious citations of old cases that may not fit very well together  in order to invoke the long established principles supposedly contained in those cases   or citing a treatise which may reflect the view of only one or two authors  they can simply cite a Restatement section  which is supposed to reflect the consensus of the American legal community  to refer to a particular common law principle   edit  Local law Law affects every aspect of American life  including parking lots  Note the citations to statutes on the sign  States have delegated lawmaking powers to thousands of agencies  townships  counties  cities  and special districts  And all the state constitutions  statutes and regulations  as well as all the ordinances and regulations promulgated by local entities  are subject to judicial interpretation like their federal counterparts  53  It is common for residents of major U S  metropolitan areas to live under six or more layers of special districts as well as a town or city  and a county or township  in addition to the federal and state governments   54  Thus  at any given time  the average American citizen is subject to the rules and regulations of several dozen different agencies at the federal  state  and local levels  depending upon one s current location and behavior   edit  Types of law  edit  Procedural law Traditionally  lawyers distinguish between procedural law  which controls the procedure followed by courts and parties to legal cases  and substantive law  which is what most people think of as law   In turn  procedural law is divided into criminal procedure and civil procedure   edit  Criminal procedure The law of criminal procedure in the United States consists of a massive overlay of federal constitutional case law interwoven with the federal and state statutes that actually provide the foundation for the creation and operation of law enforcement agencies and prison systems as well as the proceedings in criminal trials  Due to the perennial inability of legislatures in the U S  to enact statutes that would actually force law enforcement officers to respect the constitutional rights of criminal suspects and convicts  the federal judiciary gradually developed the exclusionary rule as a method to enforce such rights  In turn  the exclusionary rule spawned a family of judge made remedies for the abuse of law enforcement powers  of which the most famous is the Miranda warning  The writ of habeas corpus is often used by suspects and convicts to challenge their detention  while the Civil Rights Act of 1871 and Bivens actions are used by suspects to recover tort damages for police brutality   edit  Civil procedure Main article  Civil procedure in the United States The law of civil procedure governs process in all judicial proceedings involving lawsuits between private parties  Traditional common law pleading was replaced by code pleading in 24 states after New York enacted the Field Code in 1850  and code pleading in turn was subsequently replaced again in most states by modern notice pleading during the 20th century  The old English division between common law and equity courts was abolished in the federal courts by the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1938  it has also been independently abolished by legislative acts in nearly all states  The Delaware Court of Chancery is the most prominent of the small number of remaining equity courts  35 states have adopted rules of civil procedure closely modeled after the FRCP  including rule numbers   However  in doing so  they had to make some modifications to account for the fact that state courts have broad general jurisdiction while federal courts have relatively limited jurisdiction  New York  Illinois  and California are the most significant states that have not adopted the FRCP  Furthermore  both states continue to maintain their civil procedure laws in the form of codified statutes enacted by the state legislature  as opposed to court rules promulgated by the state supreme court  on the ground that the latter are undemocratic  But certain key portions of their civil procedure laws have been modified by their legislatures to bring them closer to federal civil procedure  55  Generally  American civil procedure has several notable features  including extensive pretrial discovery  heavy reliance on live testimony obtained at deposition or elicited in front of a jury  and aggressive pretrial  law and motion  practice designed to result in a pretrial disposition  that is  summary judgment  or a settlement  U S  courts pioneered the concept of the opt out class action  by which the burden falls on class members to notify the court that they do not wish to be bound by the judgment  as opposed to opt in class actions  where class members must join into the class  Another unique feature is the so called American Rule under which parties generally bear their own attorneys  fees  as opposed to the English Rule of  loser pays    though American legislators and courts have carved out numerous exceptions   edit  Substantive law Substantive law comprises the actual  substance  of the law  that is  the law that defines legally enforceable rights and duties  and what wrongful acts amount to violations of those rights and duties  Because substantive law by definition is enormous  the following summary briefly covers only a few highlights of each of the major components of American substantive law   edit  Criminal law Main article  Criminal law of the United States Criminal law involves the prosecution by the state of wrongful acts which are considered to be so serious that they are a breach of the sovereign s peace  and cannot be deterred or remedied by mere lawsuits between private parties   Generally  crimes can result in incarceration  but torts  see below  cannot  The majority of the crimes committed in the United States are prosecuted and punished at the state level  Federal criminal law focuses on areas specifically relevant to the federal government like evading payment of federal income tax  mail theft  or physical attacks on federal officials  as well as interstate crimes like drug trafficking and wire fraud  All states have somewhat similar laws in regard to  higher crimes   or felonies   such as murder and rape  although penalties for these crimes may vary from state to state  Capital punishment is permitted in some states but not others  Three strikes laws in certain states impose harsh penalties on repeat offenders  Some states distinguish between two levels  felonies and misdemeanors  minor crimes   Generally  most felony convictions result in lengthy prison sentences as well as subsequent probation  large fines  and orders to pay restitution directly to victims  while misdemeanors may lead to a year or less in jail and a substantial fine  To simplify the prosecution of traffic violations and other relatively minor crimes  some states have added a third level  infractions  These may result in fines and sometimes the loss of one s driver s license  but no jail time  For public welfare offenses where the state is punishing merely risky  as opposed to injurious  behavior  there is significant diversity across the various states  For example  punishments for drunk driving varied greatly prior to 1990  State laws dealing with drug crimes still vary widely  with some states treating possession of small amounts of drugs as a misdemeanor offense or as a medical issue and others categorizing the same offense as a serious felony   edit  Contract law The Uniform Commercial Code Main article  United States contract law Contract law covers obligations established by agreement  express or implied  between private parties  Generally  contract law in transactions involving the sale of goods has become highly standardized nationwide as a result of the widespread adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code  However  there is still significant diversity in the interpretation of other kinds of contracts  depending upon the extent to which a given state has codified its common law of contracts or adopted portions of the Restatement  Second  of Contracts  Parties are permitted to agree to arbitrate disputes arising from their contracts  Under the Federal Arbitration Act  which has been interpreted to cover all contracts arising under federal or state law   arbitration clauses are generally enforceable unless the party resisting arbitration can show unconscionability or fraud or something else which undermines the entire contract   edit  Tort law Main article  United States tort law Tort law generally covers any civil action between private parties arising from wrongful acts which amount to a breach of general obligations imposed by law and not by contract  Tort law covers the entire imaginable spectrum of wrongs which humans can inflict upon each other  and of course  partially overlaps with wrongs also punishable by criminal law  Although the American Law Institute has attempted to standardize tort law through the development of several versions of the Restatement of Torts  many states have chosen to adopt only certain sections of the Restatements and to reject others  Thus  because of its immense size and diversity  American tort law cannot be easily summarized  For example  a few jurisdictions allow actions for negligent infliction of emotional distress even in the absence of physical injury to the plaintiff  but most do not  For any particular tort  states differ on the causes of action  types and scope of remedies  statutes of limitations  and the amount of specificity with which one must plead the cause  With practically any aspect of tort law  there is a  majority rule  adhered to by most states  and one or more  minority rules   Notably  the most broadly influential innovation of 20th century American tort law was the rule of strict liability for defective products  which originated with judicial glosses on the law of warranty  In 1963  Roger J  Traynor of the Supreme Court of California threw away legal fictions based on warranties and imposed strict liability for defective products as a matter of public policy in the landmark case of Greenman v  Yuba Power Products  56  The American Law Institute subsequently adopted a slightly different version of the Greenman rule in Section 402A of the Restatement  Second  of Torts  which was published in 1964 and was very influential throughout the United States  57  Outside the U S   the rule was adopted by the European Economic Community in the Product Liability Directive of July 1985  58  by Australia in July 1992  59  and by Japan in June 1994  60  By the 1990s  the avalanche of American cases resulting from Greenman and Section 402A had become so complicated that another restatement was needed  which occurred with the 1997 publication of the Restatement  Third  of Torts  Products Liability  61   edit  Exceptions Much of Louisiana law is derived from French and Spanish civil law  which stems from its history as a colony of both France and Spain  62 Puerto Rico  a former Spanish colony  is also a civil law jurisdiction of the United States  63  However  the criminal law of both jurisdictions has been necessarily modified by common law influences and the supremacy of the federal Constitution  64  65  Furthermore  Puerto Rico is also unique in that it is the only U S  jurisdiction in which the everyday working language of court proceedings  statutes  regulations  and case law is Spanish  66  All states  the federal government  and most territories use American English as their working language  67  Some states  such as California  do provide certain court forms in other languages  Chinese  Korean  Spanish  Vietnamese  for the convenience of immigrants and naturalized citizens  68  But American law as developed through statutes  regulations  and case law is always in English  attorneys are expected to take and pass the bar examination in English  judges hear oral argument and give orders from the bench in English  and testimony and documents originating in other languages is translated into English before being incorporated into the official record of a case  67  Many states in the southwest that were originally Mexican territory have inherited several unique features from the civil law that governed when they were part of Mexico  These states include Arizona  California  Nevada  New Mexico  and Texas  For example  these states all have a community property system for the property of married persons  Idaho  Washington  and Wisconsin have also adopted community property systems  but they did not inherit them from a previous civil law system that governed the state   69  70  Another example of civil law influence in these states can be seen in the California Civil Code  where the law of contracts is treated as part of the law of obligations  though the rules actually codified are clearly derived from the common law   citation needed  Many of the western states  including California  Colorado  New Mexico  and Wyoming use a system of allocating water rights known as the prior appropriation doctrine  which is derived from Spanish civil law  71  It should be noted that each state has modified the doctrine to suit its own internal conditions and needs  72   edit  See also Admission to the
