Productions brought forth the idea of a cable television network with material from the studio  1  Since the company was focusing on the Epcot Center  Disney chairman Card Walker 2  turned down the proposal  3  Disney tried again in 1982  planning a partnership with the satellite unit of Group W  though the deal never came to fruition  3  In late 1982  the Disney Channel was formed under the leadership of its first president  Alan Wagner  4  Disney later invested US 11 million on two transponders of Galaxy 1  a Hughes Communications satellite  and spent US 20 million on programming  3  In 1983  Walt Disney Productions announced its launch of the family oriented cable channel  The Disney Channel launched nationally on April 18  1983 at 7 am ET 5  with the Disney Channel produced series Good Morning  Mickey  6  The channel s programming during its run as a premium channel  carrying through to its transition to a basic cable channel  targeted children and teenagers during the daytime  families during primetime and adults at night  At the time of its launch  Disney Channel was a premium channel that aired for 16 hours a day  4  from 7 a m  11 p m  ET PT  6 a m  10 p m  CT  8 a m  midnight MT   5  During its first full year  the channel was available to more than 532 000 subscribers in the U S  7  In April 1984  the channel extended its programming day to 18 hours a day by adding two hours to its late night schedule  7 a m  1 a m  ET PT  6 a m  midnight CT  8 a m  2 a m  MT   8  1983 1997  Early years In the channel s first years  shows that aired during its broadcast day included Welcome to Pooh Corner and You and Me Kid along with several foreign animated series and movies including Asterix  The Raccoons  Paddington Bear  and the Australian western Five Mile Creek  the original late night schedule featured reruns of The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet  As filler material  the channel also featured D TV  a series of MTV style music videos which showed popular music interwoven with classic Disney animation  Subscribers initially received a monthly program guide magazine  though it was phased out by the time the channel began targeting itself as a commercial free basic channel  5  Disney Channel received a special citation from the United States president Ronald Reagan in 1984  citation needed  As a premium channel  The Disney Channel would air week long previews four times a year  as well as two free preview weekends periodically  with ads targeted to non subscribers   in the same manner as other premium channels such as HBO  Cinemax and Showtime  On December 1  1986  Disney Channel began broadcasting on a 24 hour a day schedule  9  Outside of daytime programs for children  the network also aired movies and original specials  largely concert specials   largely during the nighttime hours  Disney Channel headquarters in Burbank  California  Early in 1986  the musical sitcom Kids Incorporated  about a pre teen  and later teen to young adult  gang of friends who formed a pop group  mixing their everyday situations with variety show and music video style performances  It became a hit for the channel  spawning many future stars in both music and acting during its 9 year run  including Martika  who went by her real name of Marta Marrero in the show s first season   eventual Party of Five co stars Scott Wolf and Jennifer Love Hewitt  billed as Love Hewitt   and Stacy Ferguson  nicknamed Fergie  of The Black Eyed Peas   In 1988  Good Morning  Miss Bliss  a starring vehicle for Hayley Mills of Polyanna and The Parent Trap fame  made its debut  the series was cancelled after 13 episodes due to low ratings  NBC picked up the series in 1989  retooled as Saved by the Bell  with Miss Bliss actors Mark Paul Gosselaar  Dustin Diamond  Lark Voorhies and Dennis Haskins carried over to the new show  Saved by the Bell achieved major success on NBC s Saturday morning lineup  producing two spinoffs in the process  and in worldwide syndication  In early 1989  the channel revived one of the company s early TV staples with The All New Mickey Mouse Club  which was an immediate hit that proved Disney s basic variety show formula could still work  unlike in the short lived 1970s revival  The latest version contained many of the classic elements from  theme days  to updated mouseketeer jackets  but the scripted and musical segments were more contemporary  MMC had a stellar young cast  launching the careers of future stars Christina Aguilera  JC Chasez  Ryan Gosling  Britney Spears  Justin Timberlake  Keri Russell and others  By 1989  The Disney Channel had a total of about five million pay subscribers nationwide  In 1991  eight cable providers volunteered to move The Disney Channel to their expanded basic cable packages  instead of offering it as a premium channel  Jones Intercable was the first provider to carry the channel as a basic network  initially carried on the Basic Plus tier on its Fort Myers and Broward County  Florida systems as a test run  10  11  Soon after  other cable systems began to transition the channel to their basic tiers  either as an experiment or full time  11  Even as larger multiple system operators such as Cox Communications and Marcus Cable began to offer The Disney Channel on their basic tiers  Walt Disney Company executives continued to deny any plans to convert the channel to an ad supported basic service  referring to the switches to basic on some systems as part of a five year  hybrid  strategy  allowing providers to offer it as either a pay service or a basic service  12  Also in 1991  The Disney Channel experimented with multiplexing its service  rather than broadcast three channels of its service like HBO did that same year  The Disney Channel instead tested a two channel multiplex service to two cable systems  13  By 1992  Nielsen Media Research estimated that a third of its subscriber base were adults without children in the home  14  and by 1995  The Disney Channel s subscriber base had expanded to 15 million cable homes  15  eight million of which received the channel through a premium subscription  16  In 1996  Anne Sweeney was appointed to oversee The Disney Channel  and the channel began offering a nightly primetime film  17  1997 2002  Split into Zoog  Vault  and Playhouse Disney In 1997  the channel continued its transition from a premium cable channel to being offered via expanded basic cable  transitioning fully to basic cable as late as 2004 in some markets  18  It was at this time that the channel started to increase its viewership  Around this time  the channel began to shift its target audience more toward kids  but continued to cater to families at night  19  Though Disney Channel was no longer considered a premium channel  the National Cable  amp  Telecommunications Association had long continued to rank the channel s subscriber base among all U S  premium channels in its cable subscription total rankings rather than among basic cable networks  this total is now ranked in the NCTA s basic cable subscriber rankings   On January 1  1997  Disney Channel took on a revamped look and dropped the word  The  in the network s name  however  promos often referred to the channel as simply  Disney  and the logo often omitted the  Channel  in the network s name   and split the network into three programming blocks  Playhouse Disney  comprising shows aimed at preschoolers  Vault Disney  featuring classic Disney material such as Zorro  20 The Mickey Mouse Club  the Walt Disney anthology television series  older television specials and features such as The Love Bug  and the most distinct one  running from afternoon to late evening for teenagers  called Zoog Disney  which used anthropomorphic characters called  Zoogs   who resembled robots  but the Zoog characters were given human voices  as its hosts  The Zoog Disney block was introduced in August 1998  21  shortly after the Toon Disney cable channel was launched  From September 2001 to August 2002  the entire weekend lineup  except for the Vault Disney and Playhouse Disney lineups  was branded as  Zoog Weekendz   The Zoogs  original looks were two dimensional  though they were redesigned in 2001  with a more three dimensional design and mature voices  but were phased out after less than a year  The original Disney Channel still airs between Playhouse Disney and Zoog Disney  A new channel logo  which featured a 1930s era Mickey Mouse on a black Mickey ear shaped TV   was also introduced in 1997  The channel also began to carry break interruptions  not featuring commercial advertisements  but promos for network programming and eventually promotions for Disney produced feature film and home video releases   the reasons for the channel s decision not to include traditional advertising in its programming include the possible confusion to younger viewers as to the difference between its programming and advertisements  and to prevent increases in license fees for the channel to broadcast feature films  however while the channel does not air standard ads  Disney Channel does utilize underwriter sponsorship by companies such as Best Western and Mattel for its programs   22  Disney Channel s original programming during this period began with Flash Forward in 1997 and continued with shows like The Famous Jett Jackson  So Weird  Lizzie McGuire  Even Stevens  and Kim Possible  among others  In 1999  Disney Channel began notifying the remaining cable operators who still offered the network as a premium service that they must begin carrying it on their basic cable tier or cease to carry it altogether  saying it would not renew retransmission contracts with providers that would choose to carry the network as a pay service  this included Time Warner Cable and Comcast that were the last remaining major cable providers offering the channel as a premium service  23  By 2001  Disney Channel was available to approximately 70 million cable and satellite subscribers  largely consisting of those who already received the channel via a basic tier as well as what remained of the subscribers that paid an additional fee for the channel  24  By this time  the music videos and concert specials that the channel ran since the 1997 rebrand were dropped  citing the inability to receive a stake in the revenue from artists  CD sales and lack of exclusivity for the videos  25  soon after  the channel began to incorporate music videos from songs featured in Disney s feature films and performed by artists on Radio Disney and signed by Disney s in house record companies Hollywood Records and Walt Disney Records  2002 2007  Disney Channel relaunched By 2002  Disney Channel was seen in 80 million cable homes nationwide  26  That September  Disney Channel was gradually remodeled once more  The  Zoog  brand name was phased out from on air usage  though it continued under separate website until 2003  when it was merged with Disney Channel s main website  On September 16  2002  the Vault Disney block was discontinued  primarily to contribute to the network s then upcoming  hip  image  in favor of same day repeats of the channel s original programming and off network series  as a result of Vault Disney s discontinuance  for the first time in the channel s history  Disney Channel did not feature any programming targeted at adult audiences   with the only programming that intentionally targets the entire family being the channel s primetime feature films  as of June 2011  Disney Channel is the only one out of the four largest children s cable networks in the United States that does not target a dual audience  kids in the daytime  families and adults at night  Nickelodeon  The Hub and Cartoon Network each feature program blocks that target such a dual audience   Primetime movies were also cut to one each night  from two   27  The channel also ceased producing drama and reality series  shifting focus to live action sitcoms and animated series  A month later  on October 1  2002  at 5 30 a m  ET  the last show to air under the 2000 2002 era was The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh  Promos for shows that were made during the 2000 2002 era and music videos closed out the last five minutes of the 2000 2002 era and at 5 59 a m  ET  the 2000 version of the 1997 Disney Channel logo and the 2000 2002 look  which featured kids doing activities and a colorful background changing colors  were shown for one last time before the handover to Playhouse Disney s Monday morning schedule  At 2 00 p m  ET on that same day  Disney Channel s new logo  designed by CA Square  made its first appearance by being introduced  which it will be adopted internationally in May 2003  It also unveiled its new graphics designed to fit the network s new look  After these changes  Playhouse Disney was the only one of the three blocks introduced in 1997 to continue airing  however  it was rebranded as Disney Junior in 2011  Around the same time  Disney Channel partnered with corporate sister ABC to run the channel s programming on ABC s Saturday morning block  Moreover  Disney Channel started a bumper which is still used today  Every character must introduce themselves and most character will say which series or movies are they from  After that  they will say   You re watching Disney Channel  except for animated characters  and draw the Disney Channel logo  using a glow stick  Anne Sweeney  a veteran cable executive  took control of Disney ABC Television Group in 2004 and successfully remade Disney Channel into  the major profit driver in the company   28  By 2008  Cond  Nast Portfolio was able to note that the Channel  has been adding a million viewers a month every month for the last five years   and also called the Channel  the greatest teen star incubator since the NBA stopped drafting high schoolers   28  Sweeney s successful strategy was to discover  nurture  and aggressively cross promote teen music stars whose style and image were carefully targeted to pre teens and teenagers  Beginning around that time while Disney Channel s intended target audience are preschoolers  pre teens and young adolescents  the channel began to quickly gain in popularity and created increased competition with Viacom owned Nickelodeon and the channel began to add viewers outside the main target audience and make teen idols out of some of the channel s stars  Though Disney Channel has increased its viewership to rival that of Nickelodeon  Disney Channel has yet to unseat Nickelodeon in the Nielsen ratings as the highest rated basic cable channel among total viewers  ages 2   and all kid demos  In 2003  Disney Channel released its first ever musical made for cable movie called The Cheetah Girls  it received 84 million viewers worldwide  The success of The Cheetah Girls led to the creation of other music themed original programming such as the original movie High School Musical and the original sitcom Hannah Montana  In 2005  That s So Raven became the network s highest rated series since the network s move to basic cable  as well as being the first Disney Channel Original Series to beat the 65 episode limit  the channel had formerly imposed a highly controversial programming rule in 1998  that guaranteed that any original series would end after 65 episodes as a move to prevent production cost increases  though this rule is no longer enforced   the series eventually hit 100 episodes  becoming the channel s longest running original series and became the first to spawn a spin off  Cory in the House  which was cancelled midway through its second season   The Suite Life of Zack  amp  Cody also debuted in 2005  becoming a hit for the channel  2006 saw the debut of the hit original movie High School Musical  that year also saw the debut of Hannah Montana  which launched the career of its star Miley Cyrus  herself the daughter of popular 1990s country singer Billy Ray Cyrus  who co stars in the series  On July 28 of that year  the channel saw the debut of the its first multiple series crossover  That s So Suite Life of Hannah Montana  involving That s So Raven  The Suite Life of Zack  amp  Cody and Hannah Montana   2007 present  Disney Channel today This section needs

date is High School Musical 2 which premiered on August 17 of that year to 17 2 million viewers  the highest rated scripted cable telecast ever  The channel abandoned its uniform schedules for weekday and weekend afternoons  with the exception of the 7 8 p m  ET time period   to run a five hour  at one point six hour  schedule featuring hour long blocks of various original series  and the off network programming that remained on the channel  with the schedule changing each day  Also  at 12 01 a m  ET on January 1  2007  the channel modified its on air presentation  Its logo turned into a ribbon  swirling around the screen until forming the Disney Channel logo instead of bouncing around the screen  Promo cards and bumpers were changed to an abstract atmosphere with ribbon theming and themed to the programs  as opposed to abstract objects bouncing and moving in the screen  The font was changed from Digital to Placard MT Bold and the  Hip  image was deleted completely  Instead of the Disney Channel logo popping up into a bumper and delivering a message  the ribbon swirled up  formed the logo  and another ribbon swirled out with the message  Also  when Disney Channel s on air presentation changed that day  the female announcer was dropped entirely so that she could commentate with Playhouse Disney  After these changes  the male announcer was kept as the sole announcer of Disney Channel  Promos for the next program began to only advertise the program airing afterwards and were moved from between shows to near the end of the final promo break of an episode  while a ribbon banner promoting the current program and the two programs afterwards now appeared on the bottom of the screen after the end of each promo break from 11 a m  8 p m  ET  In September 2008  slightly modified versions of these graphics were introduced for high definition  The channel also moved its original series  mostly the live action shows  from late afternoon to prime time on weekends from 8 9 p m  ET  The Friday block is preempted when a Disney Channel Original Movie is scheduled to premiere that night  The Saturday block has aired on a periodic basis since the change and

classic Disney cartoons  The first of which premiered on October 26  2009  Lonesome Ghosts  The new logo  released May 2010  is the Disney Channel logo encased in a rounded box  which looks like a smartphone application icon   the point was so that Disney could put the logo more towards the middle of the screen  like they did with the 2008 logo   but with the 2002 logo  It came into use on May 7  2010  though the logo was first seen in March 2010  and at the time was exclusively used on the weekend evening lineup  with a slow roll out of a new imaging campaign that was completed in that

usually air during promo breaks during the current program   Disney Channel mostly produces and airs original sitcoms that are geared toward teenage girls and also airs a moderate amount of animated series geared more towards upper elementary and middle school age children  Series produced by Walt Disney Television or production companies unrelated to the Walt Disney Company used to make up most of the schedule  nowadays  with the explosion of Disney Channel Original Series  these series have almost completely been dropped from the channel  In the 1980s and 1990s  Disney Channel aired classic Disney animated shorts  that were largely made when Walt Disney headed his namesake company   they were largely removed from the lineup in 2000  however their presence has returned as of 2009 with the

filmizing  technique  reducing the videotape frame rate to 24 frames per second  Movie library Main article  List of Disney Channel Original Movies A film is broadcast every weekday afternoon and most nights during the week  but not necessarily a theatrically released feature film  Disney Channel airs new original films  called Disney Channel Original Movies  or DCOMs   about 4 6 times a year  and those are frequently broadcast during the prime time slot  In 2000  Disney Channel claimed to produce a new movie each month  this only lasted throughout that same year  Disney Channel began producing its Original Movies in 1997 with the premiere of Northern Lights  The number of DCOMs per year began to increase   from two in 1997 to three in 1998 to a high of twelve in 2000  High School Musical 2

earliest original movies  particularly those made from 1997 to 2002  have seldom been aired by Disney Channel in recent years  except for some holiday themed movies  in January 2009  the channel began airing these older original movies on Friday and Saturday nights at 3 am ET PT  since June 2010  movies also air on Sundays in late night and since July 2010  the movies start at 2 30 am ET PT and some of the late night weekend movies are aired without promo breaks  A Disney Channel Original Movie used to air twice in a row on the night of its premiere  this tradition ended with the January 2006 premiere of High School Musical  Encore presentations of Disney Channel Original Movies however  still sometimes air on the channel in prime time on the Saturday and Sunday after its original Friday night debut  Camp Rock  Dadnapped  Starstruck  and Harriet the Spy  Blog Wars are the only exceptions to this rule   Camp Rock and Wendy Wu  Homecoming Warrior are currently the only DCOMs to air on a non Disney Channel branded network domestically as they have both aired on sister channel ABC Family  and Camp Rock has also aired on ABC as part of The Wonderful World of Disney  On September 13  2010  Disney Channel began airing theatrically released films in a 4 3 letterbox format on the channel s primary SD feed  broadcasting them in a similar manner to how they are aired on the HD feed  Disney Channel occasionally airs  special edition  airings of its high profile original movie premieres  sing along versions of The Cheetah Girls trilogy  High School Musical  High School Musical 2 and Camp Rock have aired in which lyrics are displayed on screen for viewers to sing with the songs in the films  the channel also airs  What s What  editions of its high profile original movies using a format that mimics the former VH1 series Pop Up Video in which facts about the movie and its stars pop up on screen at various points during the film  In part because the network does not air commercials and advertises only network programming  films typically run short of their allotted time slot interstitial programming airs to fill an entire two hour slot  usually an episode of a Disney Channel original series for a film running about 90 to 100 minutes  an 11 minute long episode of an original animated series for a film running 105 minutes  and any film longer than 105 minutes has the remaining time filled with a music video  promotions  and or shorts such as Shaun the Sheep  Have a Laugh  or Take Two with Phineas and Ferb  Programming blocks Current Disney Junior

Jessie and Fish Hooks  while Sunday nights feature Good Luck Charlie  So Random   Shake It Up  and Austin  amp  Ally  PrankStars new episodes premiere on either Friday or Sunday  Programming on both night s schedules  since October 2010  is somewhat fluid  as while all series have a permanent place on the Friday and Sunday primetime schedules  episode premieres of all of Disney Channel s original series are subject to being rotated on and off the schedule depending on which episodes are scheduled for that week as they usually air as part of a 90 minute block from 8 9 30 pm ET PT on Friday and Sunday evenings  The Saturday night schedule usually features repeats of recent episodes of the channel s original series and occasional airings of movies  after an attempt in early 2009 to use the night to launch a beachhead against Nickelodeon s Saturday night block with the premiere of JONAS and the move of Wizards of Waverly Place from Fridays to Saturdays proved unsuccessful  Encores of each night s programs typically air during the midnight 3 a m  timeslot each night in reverse fashion  Toonin  Saturdays Main article  Toonin  Saturdays Toonin  Saturdays is a Saturday morning

aired on the channel during regular programming in a ticker format  which the channel continued to use after the block was discontinued  and is used in a significantly decreased capacity as of May 2010   21  The Zoogs were given a more three dimensional redesign and mature voices in 2001  but were phased out after less than a year  With the entire block phased out by September 2002  From September 2001 to August 2002  the entire Friday  Saturday and Sunday afternoon and primetime lineup was branded as  Zoog Weekendz   Disney Nighttime   From 1983 to 1997  Disney Channel  during the

original concert specials from artists ranging from Rick Springfield to Elton John  Vault Disney   Disney Nighttime was reworked into  Vault Disney  in September 1997  upon Disney Channel s first major rebrand  Originally a Sunday only block  Vault Disney expanded to seven nights a week by 1999  and aired late nights from midnight to 6 am ET  except on Sunday nights from 1997 to 1999  when the block had a 9 pm ET start time on Sundays   The classic programming changed to feature only Disney produced television series and specials such as Zorro  Spin and Marty  The Mickey Mouse Club and the Walt Disney anthology television series  20  along with older Disney television specials  older Disney feature films also were part of the lineup from 1997 to 2000  but aired in a reduced capacity  The block also featured The Ink and Paint Club  featuring classic Disney animated shorts  which became the only remaining program on the channel to feature these shorts by 1999  upon the removal of Quack Pack from the schedule  This film  television or video related list is incomplete  you can help by expanding it with reliably sourced additions  Seasonal programming blocks Summer The network

rewrite the material   November 2011  Disney Channel has received some criticism for their current programming direction  Experts who   criticize the company for programming that has pulled away from the characters that the network s parent company  The Walt Disney Company was based on  Mickey Mouse  Donald Duck and Goofy and thus more  traditionalist  fans who   of the network have gone so far to say that the network is no longer really a Disney Channel  Other critics disapprove of the marketing strategy made by Anne Sweeney  the President of ABC Disney Television Group  39  which makes the programs on Disney Channel geared mainly toward pre teen girls and teenage girls  40  Sweeney had also said that the main goal of the programming on Disney Channel was not solely to entertain  but to also make money  officially stating that Disney Channel would be  the major profit driver for the  Walt Disney  Company   41  In December 2011  Disney Channel has pulled an episode from its original series Shake It Up  titled  Party It Up   The network had also pulled an episode from its other original series So Random   titled  Colbie Caillat   They both were pulled from the network s airing
