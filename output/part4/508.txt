 moved to Washington to work for the federal government in 1942  He subsequently served in the United States Navy during World War II  Nixon was elected to the House of Representatives in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950  His pursuit of the Hiss Case established his reputation as a leading anti communist  and elevated him to national prominence  He was the running mate of Dwight D  Eisenhower  the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 1952 election  Nixon served for eight years as vice president  He waged an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1960  narrowly losing to John F  Kennedy  and lost a race for Governor of California in 1962  In 1968  he ran again for the presidency and was elected  Although Nixon initially escalated the war in Vietnam  he subsequently ended US

 his father converted from Methodism after his marriage   and his upbringing was marked by conservative Quaker observances of the time  such as refraining from alcohol  dancing  and swearing  Nixon had four brothers  Harold  1909 33   Donald  1914 87   Arthur  1918 25   and Edward  born 1930   3  Four of the five Nixon boys were named after kings who had ruled in historical or legendary England  Richard  for example  was named after Richard the Lionheart  4  Nixon  second from right  makes his newspaper debut in 1916  contributing five cents to a fund for war orphans  Donald is to the left of his brother  Nixon s early life was marked by hardship  and he later quoted a saying of Eisenhower to describe his boyhood   We were poor  but the glory of it was  we didn t know it   5  The Nixon family ranch failed in 1922  and the family moved to Whittier  California  In an area with many Quakers  Frank Nixon opened a grocery store and gas station  6  Richard s younger brother Arthur died in 1925 after a short illness  7  At the age of twelve  Richard was found to have a spot on his lung  and with a family history of tuberculosis  he was forbidden to play sports  Eventually  the spot was found to be scar tissue from an early bout of pneumonia  8  9  Young Richard attended East Whittier Elementary School  where he was president of his eighth grade class  10  His parents believed that attendance at Whittier High School had caused Richard s older brother Harold to live a dissolute lifestyle before the older boy fell ill of tuberculosis  he died of the disease in 1933   Instead  they sent Richard to the larger Fullerton Union High School  11  12  He received excellent grades  even though he had to ride a school bus for an hour each way during his freshman year later  he lived with an aunt in Fullerton during the week  13  He played junior varsity football  and rarely missed a practice  even though he was rarely used in games  14  He had greater success as a debater  winning a number of championships and taking his only formal tutelage in public speaking from Fullerton s Head of English  H  Lynn Sheller  Nixon later remembered Sheller s words   Remember  speaking is conversation     don t shout at people  Talk to them  Converse with them   15  Nixon stated that he tried to use the conversational tone as much as possible  15  His parents permitted Richard to transfer to Whittier High School for his junior year  beginning in September 1928  At Whittier High  Nixon suffered his first electoral defeat  for student body president  He generally rose at 4 a m   to drive the family truck into Los Angeles and purchase vegetables at the market  He then drove to the store to wash and display them  before going to school  Harold had been diagnosed with tuberculosis the previous year  when their mother took him to Arizona in the hopes of improving his health  the demands on Richard increased  causing him to give up football  Nevertheless Richard graduated from Whittier High third in his class of 207 students  16  Nixon was offered a tuition grant to attend Harvard University  but Harold s continued illness and the need for their mother to care for him meant Richard was needed at the store  He remained in his hometown and attended Whittier College  his expenses there covered by a bequest from his maternal grandfather  17  Nixon played for the basketball team  he also tried out for football  but lacked the size to play  He remained on the team as a substitute  and was noted for his enthusiasm  18  Instead of fraternities and sororities  Whittier had literary societies  Nixon was snubbed by the only one for men  the Franklins  many members of the Franklins were from prominent families but Nixon was not  He responded by helping to found a new society  the Orthogonian Society  19  In addition to the society  schoolwork  and work at the store  Nixon found time for a large number of extracurricular activities  becoming a champion debater and gaining a reputation as a hard worker  20  In 1933  he became engaged to Ola Florence Welch  daughter of the Whittier police chief  The two broke up in 1935  21  After his graduation from Whittier in 1934  Nixon received a full scholarship to attend Duke University School of Law  22  The school was new and sought to attract top students by offering scholarships  23  It paid high salaries to its professors  many of whom had national or international reputations  24  The number of scholarships was greatly reduced for second and third year students  forcing recipients into intense competition  23  Nixon not only kept his scholarship but was elected president of the Duke Bar Association 25  and graduated third in his class in June 1937  22  He later wrote of his alma mater   I always remember that whatever I have done in the past or may do in the future  Duke University is responsible in one way or another   26  Early career  marriage and war service After graduating from Duke  Nixon initially hoped to join the Federal Bureau of Investigation  He received no response to his letter of application and learned years later that he had been hired  but his appointment had been canceled at the last minute due to budget cuts  27  Instead  he returned to California and was admitted to the bar in 1937  He began practicing with the law firm Wingert and Bewley in Whittier  22  working on commercial litigation for local petroleum companies and other corporate matters  as well as on wills  28  In later years  Nixon proudly stated that he was the only modern president to have previously worked as a practicing attorney  Nixon was reluctant to work on divorce cases  disliking frank sexual talk from women  29  In 1938  he opened up his own branch of Wingert and Bewley in La Habra  California  30  and became a full partner in the firm the following year  31  In January 1938  Nixon was cast in the Whittier Community Players production of The Dark Tower  There he played opposite a high school teacher named Thelma  Pat  Ryan  22  Nixon described it in his memoirs as  a case of love at first sight  32  for Nixon only  as Pat Ryan turned down the young lawyer several times before agreeing to date him  33  Once they began their courtship  Ryan was reluctant to marry Nixon  the relationship dragged on two years before she assented to his proposal  They wed at a small ceremony on June 21  1940  After a honeymoon in Mexico  the Nixons began their married life in Whittier  34  They had two children  Tricia  born 1946  and Julie  born 1948   35  In January 1942  the couple moved to Washington  D C   where Nixon took a job at the Office of Price Administration  22  In his political campaigns  Nixon would suggest that this was his response to Pearl Harbor  but he had sought the position throughout the latter part of 1941  Both Nixon and his wife believed he was limiting his prospects by remaining in Whittier  36  He was assigned to the tire rationing division  where he was tasked with replying to correspondence  He did not enjoy the role  and four months later  applied to join the United States Navy  As a birthright Quaker  he could have claimed exemption from the draft  and deferments were routinely granted for those in government service  His application was successful  and he was inducted into the Navy in August 1942  37  Nixon completed Officers Candidate School and was commissioned as an ensign in October 1942  His first post was as aide to the commander of the Ottumwa Naval Air Station in Iowa  Seeking more excitement  he requested sea duty and was reassigned as the naval passenger control officer for the South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command  supporting the logistics of operations in the South West Pacific theater  38  39  After requesting more challenging duties  he was given command of cargo handling units  40  Nixon earned two service stars and a citation of commendation  although he saw no actual combat  Upon his return to the US  Nixon was appointed the administrative officer of the Alameda Naval Air Station in California  In January 1945  he was transferred to the Bureau of Aeronautics office in Philadelphia to help negotiate the termination of war contracts  and he received another letter of commendation for his work there  41  Later  Nixon was transferred to other offices to work on contracts and finally to Baltimore  42  In October 1945  he was promoted to lieutenant commander  41  He resigned his commission on New Year s Day 1946  43  Rising politician

10  1952  Congressional career Main articles  California s 12th congressional district election  1946 and United States Senate election in California  1950 In 1945  Republicans in California s 12th congressional district  frustrated by their inability to defeat Democratic Congressman Jerry Voorhis  sought a consensus candidate who would run a strong campaign against him  They formed a  Committee of 100  to decide on a candidate  hoping to avoid internal dissensions which had led to Voorhis victories  After the committee failed to attract higher profile candidates  Herman Perry  Whittier s Bank of America branch manager  suggested Nixon  a family friend with whom he had served on the Whittier College Board of Trustees before the war  Perry wrote to Nixon in Baltimore  After a night of excited talk between the Nixons  the naval officer responded to Perry with enthusiasm  Nixon flew to California and was selected by the committee  When he left the Navy at the start of 1946  Nixon and his wife returned to Whittier  where Nixon began a year of intensive campaigning  44  45  He contended that Voorhis had been ineffective as a congressman and suggested that Voorhis s endorsement by a group linked to communists meant that Voorhis must have radical views  46  Nixon won the election  receiving 65 586 votes to Voorhis  49 994  47  In Congress  Nixon supported the Taft Hartley Act of 1947 and served on the Education and Labor Committee  He was part of the Herter Committee  which went to Europe to report on the need for US foreign aid  Nixon was the youngest member of the committee  and the only Westerner  48  Advocacy by Herter Committee members  including Nixon  led to congressional passage of the Marshall Plan  49  Nixon campaigns for the Senate in 1950  Nixon first gained national attention in 1948 when his investigation  as a member of the House Un American Activities Committee  HUAC   broke the Alger Hiss spy case  While many doubted Whittaker Chambers  allegations that Hiss  a former State Department official  had been a Soviet spy  Nixon believed them to be true  He discovered that Chambers saved microfilm reproductions of incriminating documents by hiding the film in a pumpkin  50  Hiss was convicted of perjury in 1950 for denying under oath he had passed documents to Chambers  51  In 1948  Nixon successfully cross filed as a candidate in his district  winning both major party primaries  52  and was comfortably reelected  53  In 1949  Nixon began to consider running for the United States Senate against the Democratic incumbent  Sheridan Downey  54  and entered the race in November of that year  55  Downey  faced with a bitter primary battle with Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas  announced his retirement in March 1950  56  Nixon and Douglas won the primary elections 57  and engaged in a contentious campaign in which the ongoing Korean War was a major issue  58  Nixon tried to focus attention on Douglas  liberal voting record  As part of that effort  a  Pink Sheet  was distributed by the Nixon campaign suggesting that  as Douglas  voting record was similar to that of New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio  believed by some to be a communist   their political views must be nearly identical  59  Nixon won the election by almost twenty percentage points  60  In the Senate  Nixon took a prominent position in opposing global communism  traveling frequently and speaking out against  the threat   61  He maintained friendly relations with his fellow anti communist  the controversial Wisconsin senator  Joseph McCarthy  but was careful to keep some distance between himself and McCarthy s allegations  62  Nixon also criticized President Harry S  Truman s handling of the Korean War  61  He supported statehood for Alaska and Hawaii  voted in favor of civil rights for minorities  and supported federal disaster relief for India and Yugoslavia  63  He voted against price controls and other monetary restrictions  benefits for illegal immigrants  and public power  63  Vice president A piece of literature for the Eisenhower Nixon campaign  1952 Further information  Checkers speech General Dwight D  Eisenhower was nominated for president by the Republicans in 1952  He had no strong preference for a vice presidential candidate  and Republican officeholders and party officials met in a  smoke filled room  and recommended Nixon to the general  who agreed to the senator s selection  Nixon s youth  he was then 39   stance against communism  and his political base in California one of the largest states were all seen as vote winners by the leaders  Among the candidates considered along with Nixon were Ohio Senator Robert Taft  New Jersey Governor Alfred Driscoll and Illinois Senator Everett Dirksen  64  65  On the campaign trail  Eisenhower spoke to his plans for the country  leaving the negative campaigning to his running mate  66  In mid September  the media reported that Nixon had a political fund  maintained by his backers  which reimbursed him for political expenses  Such a fund was not illegal  but it exposed Nixon to allegations of possible conflict of interest  With pressure building for Eisenhower to demand Nixon s resignation from the ticket  the senator went on television to deliver an address to the nation on September 23  1952  67  The address  later termed the Checkers speech  was heard by about 60 million Americans including the largest television audience up to that point  68  Nixon emotionally defended himself  stating that the fund was not secret  nor had donors received special favors  He painted himself as a man of modest means  his wife had no mink coat  instead she wore a  respectable Republican cloth coat   and a patriot  67  The speech would be remembered for the gift which Nixon had received  but which he would not give back   a little cocker spaniel dog     sent all the way from Texas  And our little girl Tricia  the 6 year old named it Checkers   67  The speech was a masterpiece of rhetoric and prompted a huge public outpouring of support for Nixon  69  Eisenhower decided to retain him on the ticket  70  which proved victorious in the November election  66  Eisenhower had pledged to give Nixon responsibilities during his term as vice president that would enable him to be effective from the start as a successor  Nixon attended Cabinet and National Security Council meetings and chaired them when Eisenhower was absent  A 1953 tour of the Far East succeeded in increasing local goodwill toward the United States and prompted Nixon to appreciate the potential of the region as an industrial center  He visited Saigon and Hanoi in French Indochina  71  On his return to the United States at the end of 1953  Nixon increased the amount of time he devoted to foreign relations  72  Biographer Irwin Gellman  who chronicled Nixon s congressional years  said of his vice presidency  Eisenhower radically altered the role of his running mate by presenting him with critical assignments in both foreign and domestic affairs once he assumed his office  The vice president welcomed the president s initiatives and worked energetically to accomplish White House objectives  Because of the collaboration between these two leaders  Nixon deserves the title   the first modern vice president   73  Despite intense campaigning by Nixon  who reprised his strong attacks on the Democrats  the Republicans lost control of both houses of Congress in the 1954 elections  These losses caused Nixon to contemplate leaving politics once he had served out his term  74  On September 24  1955  President Eisenhower suffered a heart attack  his condition was initially believed to be life threatening  Eisenhower was unable to perform his duties for six weeks  The 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution had not yet been proposed  and the Vice President had no formal power to act  During this time  however  Nixon acted in Eisenhower s stead  presiding over Cabinet meetings and ensuring that aides and Cabinet officers did not seek power  75  According to Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose  Nixon had  earned the high praise he received for his conduct during the crisis     he made no attempt to seize power   76  His spirits buoyed  Nixon sought a second term  but some of Eisenhower s aides aimed to displace him  In a December 1955 meeting  Eisenhower proposed that Nixon not run for reelection in order to give him administrative experience before a 1960 presidential run and instead become a Cabinet officer in a second Eisenhower administration  Nixon  however  believed such an action would destroy his political career  When Eisenhower announced his reelection bid in February 1956  he hedged on the choice of his running mate  stating that it was improper to address that question until he had been renominated  Although no Republican was opposing Eisenhower  Nixon received a substantial number of write in votes against the President in the 1956 New Hampshire primary election  In late April  the President announced that Nixon would again be his running mate  77  Eisenhower and Nixon were reelected by a comfortable margin in the November 1956 election  78  Vice President Nixon and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev argue as the press looks on in part of what came to be known as the Kitchen Debate  July 24  1959  In the spring of 1957  Nixon undertook another major foreign trip  this time to Africa  On his return  he helped shepherd the Civil Rights Act of 1957 through Congress  The bill was weakened in the Senate  and civil rights leaders were divided over whether Eisenhower should sign it  Nixon advised the President to sign the bill  which he did  79  Eisenhower suffered a mild stroke in November 1957  and Nixon gave a press conference  assuring the nation that the Cabinet was functioning well as a team during Eisenhower s brief illness  80  On April 27  1958  Richard and Pat Nixon embarked on a goodwill tour of South America  In Montevideo  Uruguay  Nixon made an impromptu visit to a college campus  where he fielded questions from students on US foreign policy  The trip was uneventful until the Nixon party reached Lima  Peru  where he was met with student demonstrations  Nixon went to the campus  got out of his car to confront the students  and stayed until forced back into the car by a volley of thrown objects  At his hotel  Nixon faced another mob  and one demonstrator spat on him  81  In Caracas  Nixon and his wife were spat on by anti American demonstrators and their limousine was attacked by a pipe wielding mob  82  According to Ambrose  Nixon s courageous conduct  caused even some of his bitterest enemies to give him some grudging respect   83  In July 1959  President Eisenhower sent Nixon to the Soviet Union for the opening of the American National Exhibition in Moscow  On July 24  while touring the exhibits with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev  the two stopped at a model of an American kitchen and engaged in an impromptu exchange about the merits of capitalism versus communism that became known as the  Kitchen Debate   84  1960 and 1962 elections  wilderness years Main article  United States presidential election  1960 In 1960  Nixon launched his first campaign for President of the United States  He faced little opposition in the Republican primaries 85  and chose former Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge  Jr  as his running mate  86  His Democratic opponent was John F  Kennedy  and the race remained close for the duration  87  Nixon campaigned on his experience  but Kennedy called for new blood and claimed the Eisenhower Nixon administration had allowed the Soviet Union to overtake the US in ballistic missiles  the  missile gap    88  A new political medium was introduced in the campaign  televised presidential debates  In the first of four such debates  Nixon appeared pale  with a five o clock shadow  in contrast to the photogenic Kennedy  86  Nixon s performance in the debate was perceived to be mediocre in the visual medium of television  though many people listening on the radio thought that Nixon had won  89  Nixon lost the election narrowly  with Kennedy ahead by only 120 000 votes  0 2 percent  in the popular vote  86  Vice President Nixon and Vice President elect Lyndon Johnson leave the White House on the morning of January 20  1961 for the Kennedy Johnson inaugural ceremonies  There were charges of vote fraud in Texas and Illinois  both states won by Kennedy  Nixon refused however to consider contesting the election  feeling a lengthy election contest would diminish the United States in the eyes of the world  and the uncertainty would hurt US interests  90  At the end of his term of office as vice president in January 1961  Nixon and his family returned to California  where he practiced law and wrote a bestselling book  Six Crises  which included coverage of the Hiss case  Eisenhower s heart attack  and the Fund Crisis  which had been resolved by the Checkers speech  86  91  Local and national Republican leaders encouraged Nixon to challenge incumbent Pat Brown for Governor of California in the 1962 election  86  Despite initial reluctance  Nixon entered the race  86  The campaign was clouded by public suspicion that Nixon viewed the office as a stepping stone for another presidential run  some opposition from the far right of the party  and his own lack of interest in being California s governor  86  Nixon hoped that a successful run would confirm him in his status as the nation s leading active Republican politician  and ensure he remained a major player in national politics  92  Instead  he lost to Brown by nearly 300 000 votes  and the defeat was widely believed to be the end of his political career  86  In an impromptu concession speech the morning after the election  Nixon blamed the media for favoring his opponent  saying   You won t have Nixon to kick around anymore because  gentlemen  this is my last press conference   93  The California defeat was highlighted in the November 11  1962  episode of ABC s Howard K  Smith  News and Comment entitled  The Political Obituary of Richard M  Nixon   94  Alger Hiss appeared on the program  and many members of the public complained that it was unseemly to allow a convicted felon air time to attack a former vice president  The furor drove Smith and his program from the air  95  and public sympathy for Nixon grew  94  Nixon shows his papers to an East German officer to cross between the sectors of the divided city of Berlin  1963  The Nixon family traveled to Europe in 1963  where Nixon gave press conferences and met with leaders of the countries he visited  96  The family moved to New York City  where Nixon became a senior partner in the leading law firm Nixon  Mudge  Rose  Guthrie  amp  Alexander  86  Nixon had pledged  when announcing his California campaign  not to run for president in 1964  even if he had not  he believed it would be difficult to defeat Kennedy  or after his assassination  Kennedy s successor Lyndon Johnson  97 In 1964  he supported Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater for the Republican nomination for president  when Goldwater was successful in gaining the nomination  Nixon was selected to introduce the candidate to the convention  Although he thought Goldwater unlikely to win  Nixon campaigned for him loyally  The election was a disaster for the Republicans  Goldwater s landslide loss to Johnson was matched by heavy losses for the party in Congress and among state governors  98  Nixon was one of the few leading Republicans not blamed for the disastrous results  and he sought to build on that in the 1966 congressional elections  He campaigned for many Republicans seeking to regain seats lost in the Johnson landslide and received credit for helping the Republicans make major gains in the midterm election  99  1968 presidential election Main articles  Richard Nixon presidential campaign  1968 and United States presidential election  1968 Nixon and Johnson meet at the White House before Nixon s nomination  July 1968  At the end of 1967  Nixon told his family he planned to run for president a second time  Although Pat Nixon did not always enjoy public life 100   for example  she had been embarrassed by the need to reveal how little the family owned in the Checkers speech   101  she was supportive of her husband s ambitions  Nixon believed that with the Democrats torn over the issue of the Vietnam War  a Republican had a good chance of winning  although he expected the election to be as close as in 1960  100  Motto on automobile trash bag given away by the Nixon campaign in California  1968 One of the most tumultuous primary election seasons ever began as the Tet Offensive was launched  followed by the withdrawal of President Johnson as a candidate after doing unexpectedly poorly in the New Hampshire primary  it concluded with the assassination of one of the Democratic candidates  Senator Robert F  Kennedy just moments after his victory in the California primary  On the Republican side  Nixon s main opposition was Michigan Governor George Romney  though New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and California Governor Ronald Reagan each hoped to be nominated in a brokered convention  Nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot  102  He selected Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew as his running mate  a choice which Nixon believed would unite the party  appealing to both Northern moderates and Southerners disaffected with the Democrats  103  Nixon s Democratic opponent in the general election was Vice President Hubert Humphrey  who was nominated at a convention marked by violent protests  104  Throughout the campaign  Nixon portrayed himself as a figure of stability during a period of national unrest and upheaval  104  He appealed to what he later called the  silent majority  of socially conservative Americans who disliked the hippie counterculture and the anti war demonstrators  Agnew became an increasingly vocal critic of these groups  solidifying Nixon s position with the right  105  Nixon waged a prominent television advertising campaign  meeting with supporters in front of cameras  106  He stressed that the crime rate was too high  and attacked what he perceived as a surrender by the Democrats of the United States  nuclear superiority  107  Nixon promised  peace with honor  in the Vietnam War and proclaimed that  new leadership will end the war and win the peace in the Pacific   108  He did not release specifics of how he hoped to end the war  resulting in media intimations that he must have a  secret plan   108  His slogan of  Nixon s the One  proved to be effective  106  In a three way race between Nixon  Humphrey  and independent candidate Alabama Governor George Wallace  Nixon defeated Humphrey by nearly 500 000 votes  seven tenths of a percentage point   with 301 electoral votes to 191 for Humphrey and 46 for Wallace  104  109  In his victory speech  Nixon pledged that his administration would try to bring the divided nation together  110  Nixon said   I have received a very gracious message from the Vice President  congratulating me for winning the election  I congratulated him for his gallant and courageous fight against great odds  I also told him that I know exactly how he felt  I know how it feels to lose a close one   111  Presidency  1969 74  Nixon is sworn in as the 37th President on January 20  1969  with the new First Lady  Pat  holding the family Bibles  Nixon was inaugurated as president on January 20  1969  sworn in by his onetime political rival  Chief Justice Earl Warren  Pat Nixon held the family Bibles open at Isaiah 2 4  which reads   They shall beat their swords into plowshares  and their spears into pruning hooks   In his inaugural address  which received almost uniformly positive reviews  Nixon remarked that  the greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker  112  a phrase that would later be placed on his gravestone  113  He spoke about turning partisan politics into a new age of unity  In these difficult years  America has suffered from a fever of words  from inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver  from angry rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds  from bombastic rhetoric that postures instead of persuading  We cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another  until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as well as our voices  114  Foreign policy Nixon and Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai toast during Nixon s 1972 visit to China  China Main article  1972 Nixon visit to China President Nixon shakes hands with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai upon arriving in Beijing  Nixon laid the groundwork for his overture to China even before he became president  writing in Foreign Affairs a year before his election   There is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation   115  Assisting him in this venture was his National Security Advisor and future Secretary of State  Henry Kissinger  with whom the President worked closely  bypassing Cabinet officials  With relations between the Soviet Union and China at a nadir border clashes between the two took place during Nixon s first year in office Nixon sent private word to the Chinese that he desired closer relations  A breakthrough came in early 1971  when Chairman Mao invited a team of American table tennis players to visit China and play against top Chinese players  Nixon followed up by sending Kissinger to China for clandestine meetings with Chinese officials  115  On July 15  1971  it was simultaneously announced by Beijing and by Nixon  on television and radio  that the President would visit China the following February  The announcements astounded the world  116  The secrecy allowed both sets of leaders time to prepare the political climate in their countries for the contact  117  In February 1972  Nixon and his wife traveled to China  Kissinger briefed Nixon for over 40 hours in preparation  118  Upon touching down  the President and First Lady emerged from Air Force One and greeted Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai  Nixon made a point of shaking Zhou s hand  something which then Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had refused to do in 1954 when the two met in Geneva  119  Over 100 television journalists accompanied the president  On Nixon s orders  television was strongly favored over printed publications  as Nixon felt that the medium would capture the visit much better than print  It also gave him the opportunity to snub the print journalists he despised  119  President Nixon greets Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong  left  in a historic visit to the People s Republic of China  1972  Nixon and Kissinger met for an hour with Mao and Zhou at Mao s official private residence  where they discussed a range of issues  120  Mao later told his doctor that he had been impressed by Nixon  whom he considered forthright  unlike the leftists and the Soviets  120  He also said he was suspicious of Kissinger  120  though the National Security Advisor referred to their meeting as his  encounter with history   119  A formal banquet welcoming the presidential party was given that evening in the Great Hall of the People  The following day  Nixon met with Zhou  the joint communique following this meeting recognized Taiwan as a part of China  and looked forward to a peaceful solution to the problem of reunification  121  When not in meetings  Nixon toured architectural wonders including the Forbidden City  Ming Tombs  and the Great Wall  119  Americans received their first glimpse into Chinese life through the cameras which accompanied Pat Nixon  who toured the city of Beijing and visited communes  schools  factories  and hospitals  119  The visit ushered in a new era of Sino American relations  104  Fearing the possibility of a Sino American alliance  the Soviet Union yielded to pressure for d tente with the United States  122  Vietnam War Main articles  Vietnam War and Role of the United States in the Vietnam War When Nixon took office  about 300 American soldiers were dying each week in Vietnam  and the war was broadly unpopular in the United States  with violent protests against the war ongoing  The Johnson administration had agreed to suspend bombing in exchange for negotiations without preconditions  but this agreement never fully took force  Nixon sought some arrangement which would permit American forces to withdraw  while leaving South Vietnam secure against attack  123  Nixon delivers an address to the nation about the bombings in Cambodia  April 30  1969 Nixon approved a secret bombing campaign of North Vietnamese positions in Cambodia in March 1969  code named Operation Menu  to destroy what was believed to be the headquarters of the Viet Cong  124  These operations resulted in heavy bombing of Cambodia  by one measurement more bombs were dropped over Cambodia under Johnson and Nixon than the Allies dropped during World War II  125  In mid 1969  Nixon began efforts to negotiate peace with the North Vietnamese  sending a personal letter to North Vietnamese leaders  and peace talks began in Paris  Initial talks  however  did not result in an agreement  126  In July 1969  Nixon visited South Vietnam  where he met with his US military commanders and President Nguyen Van Thieu  Amid protests at home demanding an immediate pullout  he implemented a strategy of replacing American troops with Vietnamese troops  known as  Vietnamization   104  He soon instituted phased US troop withdrawals 127  but authorized incursions into Laos  in part to interrupt the Ho Chi Minh trail  used to supply North Vietnamese forces  that passed through Laos and Cambodia  Nixon announced the ground invasion of Cambodia to the American public on April 30  1970  128  His responses to protesters included an impromptu  early morning meeting with them at the Lincoln Memorial on May 9  1970  129  130  131  Nixon s campaign promise to curb the war  contrasted with the escalated bombing  led to claims that Nixon had a  credibility gap  on the issue  127  In 1971  excerpts from the  Pentagon Papers   which had been leaked by Daniel Ellsberg  were published by The New York Times and The Washington Post  When news of the leak first appeared  Nixon was inclined to do nothing  the Papers  a history of United States  involvement in Vietnam  mostly concerned the lies of prior administrations and contained few real revelations  He was persuaded by Kissinger that the papers were more harmful than they appeared  and the President tried to prevent publication  The Supreme Court eventually ruled for the newspapers  132  As US troop withdrawals continued  conscription was reduced and in 1973 ended  the armed forces became all volunteer  133  After years of fighting  the Paris Peace Accords were signed at the beginning of 1973  The agreement implemented a cease fire and allowed for the withdrawal of remaining American troops  however  it did not require the 160 000 North Vietnam Army regulars located in the South to withdraw  134  Once American combat support ended  there was a brief truce  before fighting broke out again  this time without American combat involvement  North Vietnam conquered South Vietnam in 1975  135  Latin American policy Nixon and Mexican president Gustavo D az Ordaz riding a presidential motorcade in San Diego  California  September 1970  Nixon had been a firm supporter of Kennedy in the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion and 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis  on taking office he stepped up covert operations against Cuba and its president  Fidel Castro  He maintained close relations with the Cuban American exile community through his friend  Bebe Rebozo  who often suggested ways of irritating Castro  These activities concerned the Soviets and Cubans  who feared Nixon might attack Cuba in violation of the understanding between Kennedy and Khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis  In August 1970  the Soviets asked Nixon to reaffirm the agreement  Despite his hard line against Castro  Nixon agreed  The process which began in secret  but quickly leaked had not been completed when the US deduced that the Soviets were expanding their base at the Cuban port of Cienfuegos in October 1970  A minor confrontation ensued  which was concluded with an understanding that the Soviets would not use Cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles  The final round of diplomatic notes  reaffirming the 1962 accord  were exchanged in November  136  The election of Marxist candidate Salvador Allende as President of Chile in September 1970 led Nixon to order that Allende not be allowed to take office  Edward Korry  US Ambassador to Chile  told Nixon that he saw no alternative to Allende  and Nixon ruled out American intervention  though he remained willing to assist opponents of Allende who might come forward  With the Chilean armed forces in disarray following the assassination of the Army leader  General Ren  Schneider  Allende took office  137  The military regrouped under General Augusto Pinochet  who overthrew Allende in 1973  During the coup  the deposed president died under disputed circumstances  concerning which there have been allegations of American involvement  138  Soviet Union Nixon used the improving international environment to address the topic of nuclear peace  Following the announcement of his visit to China  the Nixon administration concluded negotiations for the president to visit the Soviet Union  The president and first lady arrived in Moscow on May 22  1972 and met with Leonid Brezhnev  the General Secretary of the Communist Party  Alexei Kosygin  the Chairman of the Council of Ministers  and Nikolai Podgorny  the head of state  among other leading Soviet officials  139  Nixon meets with Brezhnev during the Soviet leader s trip to the US in 1973  Nixon engaged in intense negotiations with Brezhnev  139  Out of the summit came agreements for increased trade and two landmark arms control treaties  SALT I  the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers  104  and the Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty  which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles  Nixon and Brezhnev proclaimed a new era of  peaceful coexistence A banquet was held that evening at the Kremlin  139  Seeking to foster better relations with the United States  both China and the Soviet Union cut back on their diplomatic support for North Vietnam and advised Hanoi to come to terms militarily  140  141  142  Nixon later described his strategy  I had long believed that an indispensable element of any successful peace initiative in Vietnam was to enlist  if possible  the help of the Soviets and the Chinese  Though rapprochement with China and d tente with the Soviet Union were ends in themselves  I also considered them possible means to hasten the end of the war  At worst  Hanoi was bound to feel less confident if Washington was dealing with Moscow and Beijing  At best  if the two major Communist powers decided that they had bigger fish to fry  Hanoi would be pressured into negotiating a settlement we could accept  143  Having made considerable progress over the previous two years in US Soviet relations  Nixon embarked on a second trip to the Soviet Union in 1974  144  He arrived in Moscow on June 27 to a welcome ceremony  cheering crowds  and a state dinner at the Grand Kremlin Palace that evening  144  Nixon and Brezhnev met in Yalta  where they discussed a proposed mutual defense pact  d tente  and MIRVs  While he considered proposing a comprehensive test ban treaty  Nixon felt he would not have time as president to complete it  144  There were no significant breakthroughs in these negotiations  144  Middle Eastern policy Nixon meets with President Anwar Sadat of Egypt  June 1974  As part of the Nixon Doctrine that the US would avoid direct combat assistance to allies where possible  instead giving them assistance to defend themselves  the US greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East particularly Israel  Iran and Saudi Arabia during the Nixon administration  145  The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel  an American ally in the Middle East but the support was not unconditional  Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it  The president believed that except during the Suez Crisis the US had failed to intervene with Israel  and should use the leverage of the large US military aid to Israel to urge the parties to the negotiating table  However  the Arab Israeli conflict was not a major focus of Nixon s attention during his first term for one thing  he felt that no matter what he did  American Jews would oppose his reelection  146  When an Arab coalition led by Egypt and Syria attacked in October 1973  beginning the Yom Kippur War  Israel suffered initial losses  The US took no action for several days  until Nixon ordered an airlift to Israel  taking personal responsibility for any response by Arab nations  Nixon cut through inter departmental squabbles and bureaucracy to initiate an airlift of American arms  By the time the US and Soviet Union negotiated a truce  Israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory  The war resulted in the 1973 oil crisis  in which Arab nations refused to sell crude oil to the US in retaliation for its support of Israel  147  The embargo caused gasoline shortages and rationing in the United States in late 1973  and was eventually ended by the oil producing nations as peace took hold  148  Kissinger played a major role in the settlement  and was also able to reestablish US relations with Egypt for the first time since 1967  Nixon made one of his final international visits as president there in June 1974  149  Domestic policy Nixon chats with a future voter at the Washington Senators  1969 Opening Day  with Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn  to the right of Nixon   Senators owner Bob Short and Nixon aide Jack Brennan  in uniform   Economy Further information  Nixon Shock and 1970s energy crisis At the time Nixon took office in 1969  inflation was at 4 7 percent its highest rate since the Korean War  The Great Society had been enacted under Johnson  which  together with the Vietnam War costs  was causing large budget deficits  There was little unemployment  but interest rates were at their highest in a century  150  Nixon s major economic goal was to reduce inflation  the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war  150  This could not be accomplished overnight  and the US economy continued to struggle through 1970  contributing to a lackluster Republican performance in the midterm congressional elections  Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress throughout Nixon s presidency   151  According to political economist Nigel Bowles in his 2011 study of Nixon s economic policies  the new president did little to alter Johnson s policies through the first year of his presidency  152  Nixon was far more interested in foreign affairs than domestic policies  but believed that voters tend to focus on their own financial condition  and that economic conditions were a threat to his reelection  As part of his  New Federalism  views  he proposed grants to the states  but these proposals were for the most part lost in the congressional budget process  However  Nixon gained political credit for advocating them  151  In 1970  Congress had granted the President the power to impose wage and price freezes  though the Democratic majorities  knowing Nixon had opposed such controls through his career  did not expect Nixon to actually use the authority  152  With inflation unresolved by August 1971  and an election year looming  Nixon convened a summit of his economic advisers at Camp David  He then announced temporary wage and price controls  allowed the dollar to float against other currencies  and ended the convertibility of the dollar into gold  153  Bowles points out   by identifying himself with a policy whose purpose was inflation s defeat  Nixon made it difficult for Democratic opponents     to criticize him  His opponents could offer no alternative policy that was either plausible or believable since the one they favored was one they had designed but which the president had appropriated for himself   152  Nixon s policies dampened inflation through 1972  although their aftereffects contributed to inflation during his second term and into the Ford administration  153  After he won reelection  Nixon found inflation returning  154  He reimposed price controls in June 1973  The price controls became unpopular with the public and businesspeople  who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to the price board bureaucracy  154  The controls produced food shortages  as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss  154  Despite the failure to control inflation  controls were slowly ended  and on April 30  1974  their statutory authorization lapsed  154  Governmental initiatives and organization Nixon advocated a  New Federalism   which would devolve power to state and local elected officials  though Congress was hostile to these ideas and enacted few of them  155  He eliminated the Cabinet level United States Post Office Department  which in 1971 became the government run United States Postal Service  156  Nixon was a late convert to the conservation movement  Environmental policy had not been a significant issue in the 1968 election  the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject  He saw that the first Earth Day in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject  and sought to use that to his benefit  in June he announced the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his State of the Union speech  other initiatives supported by Nixon included the Clean Air Act of 1970 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration  OSHA   the National Environmental Policy Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects  157  Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972 objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them  which he deemed excessive  After Congress overrode his veto  Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable  158  In 1971  Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts proposed a plan for universal federally run health insurance  partly motivated by dramatic rises in public and private health care expenditures  In response  Nixon proposed a health care plan which would provide insurance for low income families  and require that all employees be provided with health care  As this still would have left some forty million people uncovered  Kennedy and the other Democrats declined to support it  and the measure failed  though a Nixon proposal for increased use of health maintenance organizations passed Congress in 1973  159  US space program Nixon visits the Apollo 11 astronauts in quarantine aboard USS Hornet  Further information  Space policy of the United States After a nearly decade long national effort  the United States won the race to land astronauts on the moon on July 20  1969  with the flight of Apollo 11  Nixon spoke with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin during their moonwalk  He called the conversation  the most historic phone call ever made from the White House   160  Nixon  however  was unwilling to keep funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  NASA  at the high level seen through the 1960s as NASA prepared to send men to the moon  NASA Administrator Thomas O  Paine drew up ambitious plans for the establishment of a permanent base on the moon by the end of the 1970s and the launch of a manned expedition to Mars as early as 1981  Nixon  however  rejected both proposals  161  On May 24  1972  Nixon approved a five year cooperative program between NASA and the Soviet space program  culminating in the Apollo Soyuz Test Project  a joint mission of an American Apollo and a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft in 1975  162  Civil rights The Nixon years witnessed the first large scale integration of public schools in the South  163  Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats  whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites  164  Hopeful of doing well in the South in 1972  he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then  Soon after his inauguration  he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force  which worked with local leaders both white and black to determine how to integrate local schools  Agnew had little interest in the work  and most of it was done by Labor Secretary George Shultz  Federal aid was available  and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees  By September 1970  fewer than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools  By 1971  however  tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities  with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance  Nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use  165  In addition to desegregating public schools  Nixon implemented the Philadelphia Plan in 1970 the first significant federal affirmative action program  166  He also endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment after it passed both houses of Congress in 1972 and went to the states for ratification  167  Nixon had campaigned as an ERA supporter in 1968  though feminists criticized him for doing little to help the ERA or their cause after his election  though he appointed more women to administration positions than Lyndon Johnson had  168  Reelection  Watergate scandal  and resignation Nixon announces the release of edited transcripts of the Watergate tapes  April 29  1974  1972 presidential campaign Main article  United States presidential election  1972 Nixon believed his rise to power had peaked at a moment of political realignment  The Democratic  Solid South  had long been a frustration to Republican ambitions  Goldwater had won several Southern states by opposing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 but had alienated more moderate Southerners  Nixon s efforts to gain Southern support in 1968 were diluted by Wallace s candidacy  Through his first term  he pursued a Southern Strategy with policies  such as his desegregation plans  that would be broadly acceptable among Southern whites  encouraging them to realign with the Republicans in the aftermath of the Civil Rights era  He nominated two Southern conservatives  Clement Haynsworth and G  Harrold Carswell to the Supreme Court  but neither was confirmed by the Senate  169  Nixon meets the public during the 1972 presidential campaign  Nixon entered his name on the New Hampshire primary ballot on January 5  1972  effectively announcing his candidacy for reelection  170  Virtually assured the Republican nomination  171  the President had initially expected his Democratic opponent to be Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy  brother of the late president   but he was largely removed from contention after the 1969 Chappaquiddick incident  172  Instead  Maine Senator Edmund Muskie became the front runner  with South Dakota Senator George McGovern in a close second place  170  On June 10  McGovern won the California primary and secured the Democratic nomination  173  The following month  Nixon was renominated at the 1972 Republican National Convention  He dismissed the Democratic platform as cowardly and divisive  174  McGovern intended to sharply reduce defense spending 175  and supported amnesty for draft evaders as well as abortion rights  With some of his supporters believed to be in favor of drug legalization  McGovern was perceived as standing for  amnesty  abortion and acid   McGovern was also damaged by his vacillating support for his original running mate  Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton  dumped from the ticket following revelations that he had received treatment for depression  176  177  Nixon was ahead in most polls for the entire election cycle  and was reelected on November 7  1972 in one of the largest landslide election victories in American history  He defeated McGovern with over 60 percent of the popular vote  losing only in Massachusetts and the District of Columbia  178  Nixon fields questions at a press conference  October 26  1973  Watergate Main article  Watergate scandal The term Watergate has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration  Those activities included  dirty tricks  such as bugging the offices of political opponents and people of whom Nixon or his officials were suspicious  Nixon and his close aides ordered harassment of activist groups and political figures  using the FBI  CIA  and the Internal Revenue Service  The activities became known after five men were caught breaking into Democratic party headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington  D C  on June 17  1972  The Washington Post picked up on the story  reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward relied on an informant known as  Deep Throat  later revealed to be Mark Felt  associate director at the FBI to link the men to the Nixon administration  Nixon downplayed the scandal as mere politics  calling news articles biased and misleading  As a series of revelations made it clear that Nixon aides had committed crimes in attempts to sabotage the Democrats and others  senior aides such as White House Counsel John Dean and Chief of Staff H  R  Haldeman faced prosecution  104  179  180  In July 1973  White House aide Alexander Butterfield testified that Nixon had a secret taping system that recorded his conversations and phone calls in the Oval Office  These tapes were subpoenaed by Watergate Special Counsel Archibald Cox  Nixon refused to release them  citing executive privilege  With the White House and Cox at loggerheads  Nixon had Cox fired in October in the  Saturday Night Massacre   he was replaced by Leon Jaworski  In November  Nixon s lawyers revealed that an audio tape of conversations  held in the White House on June 20  1972  featured an 18  minute gap  180 Rose Mary Woods  the President s personal secretary  claimed responsibility for the gap  alleging that she had accidentally wiped the section while transcribing the tape  though her tale was widely mocked  The gap  while not conclusive proof of wrongdoing by the President  cast doubt on Nixon s statement that he had been unaware of the cover up  181  A demonstrator demands Nixon s impeachment  October 1973  Though Nixon lost much popular support  even from his own party  he rejected accusations of wrongdoing and vowed to stay in office  180  He insisted that he had made mistakes  but had no prior knowledge of the burglary  did not break any laws  and did not learn of the cover up until early 1973  182  On October 10  1973  Vice President Agnew resigned amid allegations unrelated to Watergate of bribery  tax evasion and money laundering from his tenure as Maryland s governor  Nixon chose Gerald Ford  Minority Leader of the House of Representatives  to replace Agnew  183  On November 17  1973  during a televised question and answer session with the press  184  Nixon said  People have got to know whether or not their President is a crook  Well  I m not a crook  I ve earned everything I ve got  185  The legal battle over the tapes continued through early 1974  and in April 1974 Nixon announced the release of 1 200 pages of transcripts of White House conversations between him and his aides  The House Judiciary Committee  opened impeachment hearings against the President on May 9  1974  which were televised on the major networks  These hearings culminated in votes for articles of impeachment  the first being 27 11 in favor on July 27  1974 on obstruction of justice  182  On July 24  the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the full tapes  not just selected transcripts must be released  186  Even with support diminished by the continuing series of revelations  Nixon hoped to win through  However  one of the new tapes  recorded soon after the break in  demonstrated that Nixon had been told of the White House connection to the Watergate burglaries soon after they took place  and had approved plans to thwart the investigation  In a statement accompanying the release of the  Smoking Gun Tape  on August 5  1974  Nixon accepted blame for misleading the country about when he had been told of the truth behind the Watergate break in  stating that he had a lapse of memory  187  He met with Republican congressional leaders soon after  and was told he faced certain impeachment in the House and had  at most  15 senators prepared to vote for his acquittal far fewer than the 34 he needed to avoid removal from office  188  Resignation Richard Nixon resigns Resignation speech of President Richard Nixon  delivered August 8  1974  Problems listening to this file  See media help  In light of his loss of political support and the near certainty of impeachment  Nixon resigned the office of the presidency on August 9  1974  after addressing the nation on television the previous evening  182  The resignation speech was delivered from the Oval Office and was carried live on radio and television  Nixon stated that he was resigning for the good of the country and asked the nation to support the new president  Gerald Ford  Nixon went on to review the accomplishments of his presidency  especially in foreign policy  189  He defended his record as president  and stated  Nixon s resignation letter to the Secretary of State  Sometimes I have succeeded and sometimes I have failed  but always I have taken heart from what Theodore Roosevelt once said about the man in the arena   whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood  who strives valiantly  who errs and comes up short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcoming  but who does actually strive to do the deed  who knows the great enthusiasms  the great devotions  who spends himself in a worthy cause  who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievements and who at the worst  if he fails  at least fails while daring greatly   190  Nixon s speech contained no admission of wrongdoing  and was termed  a masterpiece  by Conrad Black  one of his biographers  Black opined that  What was intended to be an unprecedented humiliation for any American president  Nixon converted into a virtual parliamentary acknowledgement of almost blameless insufficiency of legislative support to continue  He left while devoting half his address to a recitation of his accomplishments in office   191  The initial response from network commentators was generally favorable  with only Roger Mudd of CBS stating that Nixon had evaded the issue  and had not admitted his role in the cover up  192  Later years and death President Ronald Reagan meets with his three predecessors  Ford  Carter and Nixon at the White House  October 1981  the three former presidents would represent the United States at the funeral of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat  Pardon and illness Following his resignation  the Nixons flew to their home La Casa Pacifica in San Clemente  California  193  According to his biographer  Aitken  after his resignation   Nixon was a soul in torment   194  Congress had funded Nixon s transition costs  including some salary expenses  though reducing the appropriation from  850 000 to  200 000  With some of his staff still with him  Nixon was at his desk by 7 a m  with little to do  194  His former press secretary  Ron Ziegler  sat with him alone for hours each day  195  Nixon s resignation had not put an end to the desire among many to see him punished  The Ford White House considered a pardon of Nixon  though it would be unpopular in the country  Nixon  contacted by Ford emissaries  was initially reluctant to accept the pardon  but then agreed to do so  Ford  however  insisted on a statement of contrition  Nixon felt he had not committed any crimes and should not have to issue such a document  Ford eventually agreed  and on September 8  1974  he granted Nixon a  full  free  and absolute pardon   which ended any possibility of an indictment  Nixon then released a statement  I was wrong in not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in dealing with Watergate  particularly when it reached the stage of judicial proceedings and grew from a political scandal into a national tragedy  No words can describe the depth of my regret and pain at the anguish my mistakes over Watergate have caused the nation and the presidency  a nation I so deeply love  and an institution I so greatly respect  196  197  In October 1974  Nixon fell ill with phlebitis  Told by his doctors that he could either be operated on or die  a reluctant Nixon chose surgery  and President Ford visited him in the hospital  Nixon was under subpoena for the trial of three of his former aides Dean  Haldeman  and John Ehrlichman and The Washington Post  disbelieving his illness  printed a cartoon showing Nixon with a cast on the  wrong foot   Judge John Sirica excused Nixon s presence despite the defendants  objections  198  Congress instructed Ford to retain Nixon s presidential papers beginning a three decade legal battle over the documents that eventually would be won by the former president and his estate  199  Nixon was in the hospital when the 1974 midterm elections were held  and Watergate and the pardon were contributing factors to the Republican loss of 43 seats in the House and three in the Senate  200  Return to public life In December 1974  Nixon began planning his comeback despite the considerable ill will against him in the country  He wrote in his diary  referring to himself and Pat  So be it  We will see it through  We ve had tough times before and we can take the tougher ones that we will have to go through now  That is perhaps what we were made for to be able to take punishment beyond what anyone in this office has had before particularly after leaving office  This is a test of character and we must not fail the test  201  Nixon  right  joins Gerald Ford  center  and President Jimmy Carter  left  at the White House for the funeral of former Vice President Hubert Humphrey  1978  By early 1975  Nixon s health was improving  He maintained an office in a Coast Guard station 300 yards from his home  at first taking a golf cart and later walking the route each day  he mainly worked on his memoirs  202  He had hoped to wait before writing his memoirs  the fact that his assets were being eaten away by expenses and lawyer fees compelled him to begin work quickly  203  He was handicapped in this work by the end of his transition allowance in February  which compelled him to part with much of his staff  including Ziegler  204  In August of that year  he met with British talk show host and producer David Frost  who paid him  600 000 for a series of sit down interviews  filmed and aired in 1977  205  They began on the topic of foreign policy  recounting the leaders he had known  but the most remembered section of the interviews was that on Watergate  Nixon admitted that he had  let down the country  and that  I brought myself down  I gave them a sword and they stuck it in  And they twisted it with relish  And  I guess  if I d been in their position  I d have done the same thing   206  The interviews garnered 45 50 million viewers becoming the most watched program of their kind in television history  207  The interviews helped improve Nixon s financial position at one point in early 1975 he had only  500 in the bank as did the sale of his Key Biscayne property to a trust set up by wealthy Nixon friends such as Bebe Rebozo  208  In February 1976  Nixon visited China at the personal invitation of Mao  Nixon had wanted to return to China  but chose to wait until after Ford s own visit in 1975  209  Nixon remained neutral in the 1976 primary battle between Ford and Reagan won by Ford in a close fight at the convention in Kansas City  at which Nixon  who had been nominated by five of the previous six conventions  was not mentioned once  Ford lost narrowly in the general election to Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter  which led to suggestions that Ford would have been elected had he not pardoned Nixon  Nixon biographer Black points out that had no pardon been issued  Nixon would likely have been on trial in November 1976  causing a GOP loss by a much greater margin  210  The Carter administration had little use for Nixon and blocked his planned trip to Australia  causing the government of Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser to withhold from him an official invitation  211  In early 1978  Nixon went to the United Kingdom  He was shunned by American diplomats and by most ministers of the James Callaghan government  He was welcomed  however  by the Leader of the Opposition  Margaret Thatcher  as well as by former prime ministers Lord Home and Sir Harold Wilson  though two other former prime ministers  Harold Macmillan and Edward Heath declined to meet with him  Nixon addressed the Oxford Union regarding Watergate  Some people say I didn t handle it properly and they re right  I screwed it up  Mea culpa  But let s get on to my achievements  You ll be here in the year 2000 and we ll see how I m regarded then  212  Author and elder statesman Nixon speaks with Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping and US President Jimmy Carter at the White House  1979  In 1978  Nixon published his memoirs  RN  The Memoirs of Richard Nixon  the first of ten books he was to author in his retirement  193  The book was a bestseller and attracted a generally positive critical response  213  Nixon journeyed to the White House in 1979  invited by Carter for the state dinner for Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping  Carter had not wanted to invite Nixon  but Deng had stated he would visit Nixon in California if the former president was not invited  Nixon had a private meeting with Deng and visited Beijing again in mid 1979  214  In early 1980  the Nixons purchased a New York City townhouse after being rejected by two Manhattan co ops  215  When the former Shah of Iran died in Egypt in July 1980  Nixon defied the State Department  which intended to send no US representative  by attending the funeral  Though Nixon had no official credentials  as a former president he was seen as the American presence at its former ally s funeral  216  Nixon supported Ronald Reagan for president in 1980  making television appearances portraying himself as  in biographer Stephen Ambrose s words   the senior statesman above the fray   217  He wrote guest articles for many publications both during the campaign and after Reagan s victory  218  After eighteen months in the New York City townhouse  Nixon and his wife moved in 1981 to Saddle River  New Jersey  193  Throughout the 1980s  Nixon maintained an ambitious schedule of speaking engagements and writing  193  traveled  and met with many foreign leaders  especially those of Third World countries  He joined former Presidents Ford and Carter as representatives of the United States at the funeral of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat  193  On a trip to the Middle East  Nixon made his views known regarding Saudi Arabia and Libya  which attracted significant US media attention  The Washington Post ran stories on Nixon s  rehabilitation   219  Nixon journeyed to the Soviet Union in 1986 and on his return sent President Reagan a lengthy memorandum containing foreign policy suggestions and his personal impressions of Mikhail Gorbachev  193  Following this trip  Nixon was ranked in a Gallup poll as one of the ten most admired men in the world  220  Nixon visits President Bill Clinton in the White House family quarters  March 1993  In 1986  Nixon addressed a convention of newspaper publishers  impressing his audience with his tour d horizon of the world  221  At the time  political pundit Elizabeth Drew wrote   Even when he was wrong  Nixon still showed that he knew a great deal and had a capacious memory  as well as the capacity to speak with apparent authority  enough to impress people who had little regard for him in earlier times   221 Newsweek ran a story on  Nixon s comeback  with the headline  He s back   222  On July 19  1990  the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda  California opened as a private institution with the Nixons in attendance  They were joined by a large crowd of people  including Presidents Ford  Reagan  and George H  W  Bush  as well as their wives  Betty  Nancy  and Barbara  223  In January 1991  the former president founded the Nixon Center  today the Center for the National Interest   a Washington policy think tank and conference center  224  Pat Nixon died on June 22  1993  of emphysema and lung cancer  Her funeral services were held on the grounds of the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace  Former President Nixon was distraught throughout the interment  225  Inside the building  he delivered a moving tribute to her  225  Death and funeral Main article  Death and funeral of Richard Nixon Five US presidents and their first ladies attend the funeral of Richard Nixon  April 27  1994  Nixon suffered a severe stroke on April 18  1994  while preparing to eat dinner in his Park Ridge  New Jersey home  226  A blood clot resulting from his heart condition had formed in his upper heart  broken off  and traveled to his brain  He was taken to New York Hospital Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan  initially alert but unable to speak or to move his right arm or leg  226  Damage to the brain caused swelling  cerebral edema   and Nixon slipped into a deep coma  He died at 9 08 p m  on April 22  1994  with his daughters at his bedside  He was 81 years old  226  Nixon s funeral took place on April 27  1994 the first for an American president since Lyndon B  Johnson s in 1973  over which Nixon had presided  Eulogists at the Nixon Library ceremony included then President Bill Clinton  former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger  Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole  California Governor Pete Wilson  and the Reverend Billy Graham  Also in attendance were former Presidents Ford  Carter  Reagan  George H  W  Bush  and their wives  227  Richard Nixon rests beside his wife Pat on the grounds of the Nixon Library  He was survived by his two daughters  Tricia and Julie  and four grandchildren  226  In keeping with his wishes  his funeral was not a full state funeral  though his body did lie in repose in the Nixon Library lobby from April 26 to the morning of the funeral services  228  Mourners waited in line up to eight hours in chilly  wet weather to pay their respects  229  At its peak  the line to pass by Nixon s casket was three miles long with an estimated 42 000 people waiting to pay their respects  230  John F  Stacks of Time magazine said of Nixon shortly after his death   An outsize energy and determination drove him on to recover and rebuild after every self created disaster that he faced  To reclaim a respected place in American public life after his resignation  he kept traveling and thinking and talking to the world s leaders     and by the time Bill Clinton came to the White House  in 1993   Nixon had virtually cemented his role as an elder statesman  Clinton  whose wife served on the staff of the committee that voted to impeach Nixon  met openly with him and regularly sought his advice   231 Tom Wicker of The New York Times noted that Nixon had been equalled only by Franklin Roosevelt in being five times nominated on a major party ticket and  quoting Nixon s 1962 farewell speech  wrote   Richard Nixon s jowly  beard shadowed face  the ski jump nose and the widow s peak  the arms upstretched in the V sign  had been so often pictured and caricatured  his presence had become such a familiar one in the land  he had been so often in the heat of controversy  that it was hard to realize the nation really would not  have Nixon to kick around anymore    232  Ambrose said of the reaction to Nixon s death   To everyone s amazement  except his  he s our beloved elder statesman   233  Upon Nixon s death  almost all of the news coverage mentioned Watergate  but for the most part  the coverage was favorable to the former president  The Dallas Morning News stated   History ultimately should show that despite his flaws  he was one of our most farsighted chief executives   234  This offended some  columnist Russell Baker complained of  a group conspiracy to grant him absolution   235  Cartoonist Jeff Koterba of the Omaha World Herald depicted History before a blank canvas  his subject Nixon  as America looks on eagerly  The artist urges his audience to sit down  the work will take some time to complete  as  this portrait is a little more complicated than most   236  Legacy Historian and political scientist James MacGregor Burns observed of Nixon   How can one evaluate such an idiosyncratic president  so brilliant and so morally lacking   237  Nixon s biographers disagree on how he will be perceived by history  According to Ambrose   Nixon wanted to be judged by what he accomplished  What he will be remembered for is the nightmare he put the country through in his second term and for his resignation   238  Irwin Gellman  who chronicled Nixon s congressional career  suggests that  he was remarkable among his congressional peers  a success story in a troubled era  one who steered a sensible anti Communist course against the excess of McCarthy   239  Aitken feels that  Nixon  both as a man and as a statesman  has been excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his virtues  Yet even in a spirit of historical revisionism  no simple verdict is possible   240  The graves of President Richard Nixon  right  and First Lady Pat Nixon Nixon s Southern Strategy is credited by some historians as causing the South to become a Republican stronghold  though others deem economic factors more important to the change  169  Throughout his career  he was instrumental in moving his party away from the control of isolationists  and as a congressman was a persuasive advocate of containing Soviet communism  241  According to his biographer  Herbert Parmet   Nixon s role was to steer the Republican party along a middle course  somewhere between the competitive impulses of the Rockefellers  the Goldwaters  and the Reagans   242  Nixon is given credit for his stance on domestic affairs  which resulted in the passage and enforcement of environmental and regulatory legislation  Historian Paul Charles Milazzo in his 2011 paper on Nixon and the environment  points to Nixon s creation of the EPA and his enforcement of legislation such as the 1973 Endangered Species Act  stating that  though unsought and unacknowledged  Richard Nixon s environmental legacy is secure   243  Nixon saw his policies regarding Vietnam  China  and the Soviets as key to his place in history  145 George McGovern  Nixon s onetime opponent  commented in 1983   President Nixon probably had a more practical approach to the two superpowers  China and the Soviet Union  than any other president since World War II     With the exception of his inexcusable continuation of the war in Vietnam  Nixon really will get high marks in history   244  Political scientist Jussi M  Hanhim ki disagrees  saying Nixon s diplomacy was merely a continuation of the Cold War policy of containment  using diplomatic rather than military means  145  Historian Keith W  Olson has written that Nixon left a negative legacy  fundamental mistrust of government with its roots in Vietnam and Watergate  245  During the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998  both sides tried to use Nixon and Watergate to their advantage  Republicans suggested that Clinton s misconduct had been comparable to Nixon s  while Democrats contended that Nixon s actions had been far more serious than those of the incumbent  246  Another legacy  for a time  was a decrease in the power of the presidency as Congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake of Watergate  Olson  however suggests that grants of power to George W  Bush in the aftermath of the 9 11 attacks restored the president s power  245  Personality and public image Nixon and Elvis Presley in December 1970   The President  amp  The King  Nixon s career was frequently dogged by his persona and the public s perception of it  Editorial cartoonists and comedians often exaggerated his appearance and mannerisms  to the point where the line between the human and the caricature became increasingly blurred  He was often portrayed with unshaven jowls  slumped shoulders  and a furrowed  sweaty brow  247  Nixon had a complex personality  both very secretive and awkward  yet strikingly reflective about himself  He was inclined to distance himself from people and was formal in all aspects  wearing a coat and tie even when home alone  248  Nixon biographer Conrad Black described him as being  driven  though also  uneasy with himself in some ways   249  According to Black  Nixon  thought that he was doomed to be traduced  double crossed  unjustly harassed  misunderstood  underappreciated  and subjected to the trials of Job  but that by the application of his mighty will  tenacity  and diligence  he would ultimately prevail   250  Biographer Elizabeth Drew summarized Nixon as a  smart  talented man  but most peculiar and haunted of presidents   251  In his account of the Nixon presidency  author Richard Reeves described Nixon as  a strange man of uncomfortable shyness who functioned best  alone with his thoughts   252  Nixon s presidency was doomed by his personality  Reeves argues   He assumed the worst in people and he brought out the worst in them     He clung to the idea of being  tough   He thought that was what had brought him to the edge of greatness  But that was what betrayed him  He could not open himself to other men and he could not open himself to greatness   253  Nixon with Bebe Rebozo  left  and FBI Director J  Edgar Hoover  The three men relax before dinner  Key Biscayne  FL  December 1971  In October 1999  a volume of 1971 White House audio tapes was released that contained statements by Nixon deemed derogatory toward Jews  254  In one conversation with H  R  Haldeman  Nixon said that Washington was  full of Jews  and that  most Jews are disloyal   making exceptions for some of his top aides  255  He then added   But  Bob  generally speaking  you can t trust the bastards  They turn on you  Am I wrong or right   255  Elsewhere in the 1971 recordings  Nixon denies being anti Semitic  saying   If anybody who s been in this chair ever had reason to be anti Semitic  I did     And I m not  you know what I mean   255  Nixon believed that putting distance between himself and other people was necessary for him as he advanced in his political career and became president  Even Bebe Rebozo  by some accounts his closest friend  did not call him by his first name  Nixon stated of this   Even with close friends  I don t believe in letting your hair down  confiding this and that and the other thing saying   Gee  I couldn t sleep      I believe you should keep your troubles to yourself  That s just the way I am  Some people are different  Some people think it s good therapy to sit with a close friend and  you know  just spill your guts      and  reveal their inner psyche whether they were breast fed or bottle fed  Not me  No way   256  When told that most Americans  even at the end of his career  did not feel they knew him  Nixon replied   Yeah  it s true  And it s not necessary for them to know   256  See also conservatism portal Murray Chotiner  Nixon s campaign manager
