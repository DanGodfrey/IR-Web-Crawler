Western United States From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search  American West  redirects here  For the similarly named airline  see America West Airlines  This article needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   May 2007  Regional definitions vary from source to source  As defined by the Census Bureau  the western United States includes 13 states  Alaska  Arizona  California  Colorado  Hawaii  Idaho  Montana  Nevada  New Mexico  Oregon  Utah  Washington  and Wyoming  In turn  this region is sub divided into Mountain and Pacific areas  The states in light red  particularly the Plains States  are sometimes considered  western   although they are often grouped with separate regions such as the Midwest and the South  This video over the Western United States was taken by the crew of Expedition 29 on board the International Space Station  The Gateway Arch in St  Louis  also known as the  Gateway to the West   commemorates the westward expansion of the United States  The Western United States  commonly referred to as the American West or simply  the West   traditionally refers to the region comprising the westernmost states of the United States  Because the U S  expanded westward after its founding  the meaning of the West has evolved over time  Prior to about 1800  the crest of the Appalachian Mountains was seen as the western frontier  Since then  the frontier moved further west and the Mississippi River was referenced as the easternmost possible boundary of the West  In the 21st century  the states which include the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin to the West Coast are generally considered to comprise the American West  Besides being a purely geographical designation   The West  also has anthropological connotations  While this region has its own internal diversity  there is arguably an overall shared history  culture  music  cuisine   mind set or world view and closely interrelated dialects of English  As with any region of such geographically large extent and varied culural histories  many subregions of The American West possess distinguishing and idiosyncratic qualities  The  West  had played an important part in American history  the Old West is embedded in America s folklore  In its most extensive definition  the western U S  is the largest region  covering more than half the land area of the United States  It is also the most geographically diverse  incorporating geographic regions such as the Pacific Coast  the temperate rainforests of the Northwest  the Rocky Mountains  the Great Plains  most of the tall grass prairie eastward to Western Wisconsin  Illinois  the western Ozark Plateau  the western portions of the southern forests  the Gulf Coast  and all of the desert areas located in the United States  the Mojave  Sonoran  Great Basin  and Chihuahua deserts   The states from the Rockies westward have something of a dual nature of semiarid steppes and arid deserts in the lowlands and plateaus  and mountains and coniferous forests in the uplands and coastal regions  The region encompasses some of the Louisiana Purchase  most of the land ceded by Britain in 1818  some of the land acquired when the Republic of Texas joined the U S   all of the land ceded by Britain in 1846  all of the land ceded by Mexico in 1848  and all of the Gadsden Purchase  Arizona  New Mexico  Nevada  Colorado  and Utah are typically considered to be part of the southwest  and Texas and Oklahoma are frequently considered part of the Southwest as well  Idaho  Montana  Oregon  Washington  and Wyoming can be considered part of the Northwest  and the addition of the Canadian province of British Columbia comprise the Pacific Northwest  There is also another region of both southwest and northwest states called the Mountain West  which is Arizona  New Mexico  Colorado  Utah  Nevada  Montana  Idaho  and Wyoming  The West can be divided into the Pacific States  Alaska  California  Hawaii  Oregon  and Washington  with the term West Coast usually restricted to just California  Oregon  and Washington  and the Mountain States  always Arizona  Colorado  Idaho  Montana  Nevada  New Mexico  Utah  and Wyoming  Alaska and Hawaii  being detached from the other western states  have few similarities with them  but are usually also classified as part of the West  Western Texas in the Chihuahuan Desert is also traditionally considered part of the Western U S  though from a climatological perspective the West might be said to begin just west of Austin  TX where annual rainfall drops off significantly from what is typically experienced in the East  with a concurrent change in plant and animal species  Some western states are grouped into regions with eastern states  Kansas  Nebraska  South Dakota and North Dakota are often included in the Midwest  which also includes states like Iowa  Illinois and Wisconsin  Arkansas  Louisiana  Oklahoma  and Texas are also considered part of the South  It is rare for any state east of the Mississippi River to be considered part of the modern west  Historically  however  the Northwest Territory was an important early territory of the U S   comprising the modern states of Ohio  Indiana  Illinois  Michigan and Wisconsin  as well as the northeastern part of Minnesota  Also  American sports leagues with a  Western  conference or division often have members east of the Mississippi for various reasons such as not enough true Western teams  not strictly adhering to geographic regions  etc  For example  the NBA and NHL each have a Western Conference with a member in Tennessee  Contents 1 Demographics 2

White 12 1  of Some other race 7 9  Asian 4 9  Black or African American 4 3  Two or more races 1 8  American Indian and Alaska Native 0 5  Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander 24 3  were Hispanic or Latino  of any race  1  As defined by the United States Census Bureau  2  the Western region of the United States includes 13 states  with a total 2010 estimated population of 71 945 553 3   and is split into two smaller units  or divisions  The Mountain States  Montana  Wyoming  Colorado  New Mexico  Idaho  Utah  Arizona  and Nevada The Pacific States  Washington  Oregon  California  Alaska and Hawaii However  the United States Census Bureau uses only one definition of the West in its reporting system  which may not coincide with what may be historically or culturally considered the West  For example  in the 2000 Census  the Census Bureau included the state with the second largest Hispanic population  Texas  in the South  included the state with the second largest American Indian population  Oklahoma  also in the South  and included the Dakotas  with their large populations of Plains Indians  in with the Midwest  However  it should be noted that the western half of Oklahoma and far West Texas  are usually neither culturally  geographically or socioeconomically identified with the South  Statistics from the 2000 United States Census  adjusted to include the second tier of States west of the Mississippi  show that  under that definition  the West would have a population of 91 457 662  including 1 611 447 Indians  or 1 8  of the total  and 22 377 288 Hispanics  the majority Mexican   or 24 5  of the total  Indians comprise 0 9  of all Americans  and Hispanics  12 5   Asians  important from the very beginning in the history of the West  totaled 5 161 446  or 5 6   with most living in the Far West  African Americans  totaled 5 929 968  or 6 5  lower than the national proportion  12 8    The highest concentrations  12   of black residents in the West are found in Texas which is also considered a Southern state and in California  The West is still one of the most sparsely settled areas in the United States with 49 5 inhabitants per square mile  19 km    Only Texas with 78 0 inhabitants sq mi   30 km    Washington with 86 0 inhabitants sq mi   33 km    and California with 213 4 inhabitants sq mi   82 km   exceed the national average of 77 98 inhabitants sq mi   30 km    These maps from the 2000 US Census highlight differences from state to state of three minority groups  Note that most of the Native American  Hispanic  and Asian population is in the West  The entire Western region has also been strongly influenced by European  Hispanic  Asian  and Native Americans  it contains the largest number of minorities in the U S  and encompasses the only four American states where all racial groups including Caucasians are a minority  California  Hawaii  New Mexico  and Texas   While most of the studies of racial dynamics in America such as riots in Los Angeles have been written about European and African Americans  in many cities in the West and California  European and African Americans together are less than half the population because of the preference for the region by Hispanics and Asians  African and European Americans  however  continue to wield a stronger political influence because of the lower rates of citizenship and voting among Asians and Hispanics  The Western United States has a higher sex ratio  more males than females  than any other region in the United States  4  Because the tide of development had not yet reached most of the West when conservation became a national issue  agencies of the federal government own and manage vast areas of land   The most important among these are the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management within the Interior Department  and the U  S  Forest Service within the Agriculture Department   National parks are reserved for recreational activities such as fishing  camping  hiking  and boating  but other government lands also allow commercial activities like ranching  logging and mining  In recent years  some local residents who earn their livelihoods on federal land have come into conflict with the land s managers  who are required to keep land use within environmentally acceptable limits  The largest city in the region is Los Angeles  located on the West Coast  Other West Coast cities include San Diego  San Bernardino  San Jose  San Francisco  Oakland  Sacramento  Seattle  Tacoma and Portland  Prominent cities in the Mountain States include Denver  Colorado Springs  Phoenix  Tucson  Albuquerque  Las Vegas  Salt Lake City  Boise  El Paso and Cheyenne hi  edit  Natural geography The geography of the Western United States is split into three major physiographic divisions  the Rocky Mountain System  areas 16 19 on map   the Intermontane Plateaus  20 22   and the Pacific Mountain System  23 25   Along the Pacific Ocean coast lie the Coast Ranges  which  while not approaching the scale of the Rocky Mountains  are formidable nevertheless  They collect a large part of the airborne moisture moving in from the ocean  East of the Coast Ranges lie several cultivated fertile valleys  notably the San Joaquin Valley of California and the Willamette Valley of Oregon  Beyond the valleys lie the Sierra Nevada in the south and the Cascade Range in the north  Mount Whitney  at 14 505 feet  4 421 m  the tallest peak in the contiguous 48 states  is in the Sierra Nevada  The Cascades are also volcanic  Mount Rainier  a volcano in Washington  is also over 14 000 feet  4 300 m   Mount St  Helens  a volcano in the Cascades erupted explosively in 1980  A major volcanic eruption at Mount Mazama around 4860 BCE formed Crater Lake  These mountain ranges see heavy precipitation  capturing most of the moisture that remains after the Coast Ranges  and creating a rain shadow to the east forming vast stretches of arid land  These dry areas encompass much of Nevada  Utah and Arizona  The Mojave Desert and Sonoran Desert along with other deserts are found here  Beyond the deserts lie the Rocky Mountains  In the north  they run almost immediately east of the Cascade Range  so that the desert region is only a few miles wide by the time one reaches the Canadian border  The Rockies are hundreds of miles wide  and run uninterrupted from New Mexico to Alaska  The Rocky Mountain Region is the highest overall area of the United States  with an average elevation of above 4 000 feet  The tallest peaks of the Rockies  54 of which are over 14 000 feet  4 250 meters approx    are found in central and western Colorado  The West has several long rivers that empty into the Pacific Ocean  while the eastern rivers run into the Gulf of Mexico  The Mississippi River forms the easternmost possible boundary for the West today  The Missouri River  a tributary of the Mississippi  flows from its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains eastward across the Great Plains  a vast grassy plateau  before sloping gradually down to the forests and hence to the Mississippi  The Colorado River snakes through the Mountain states  at one point forming the Grand Canyon  The Colorado is a major source of water in the Southwest and many dams  such as the Hoover Dam  form reservoirs along it  So much water is drawn for drinking water throughout the West and irrigation in California that in some years  water from the Colorado no longer reaches the Gulf of California  The Columbia River  the largest river in volume flowing into the Pacific Ocean from North America  and its tributary  the Snake River  water the Pacific Northwest  The Platte runs through Nebraska and was known for being a mile  2 km  wide but only a half inch  1 cm  deep  The Rio Grande forms the border between Texas and Mexico before turning due north and splitting New Mexico in half  According to the United States Coast Guard   The Western Rivers System consists of the Mississippi  Ohio  Missouri  Illinois  Tennessee  Cumberland  Arkansas and White Rivers and their tributaries  and certain other rivers that flow towards the Gulf of Mexico   5   edit  Climate and agriculture Most of the public land held by the U S  National Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management is in the Western states  Public lands account for 25 to 75 percent of the total land area in these states  6  Bureau of Reclamation regions As a generalization  the climate of the West can be described as overall semiarid  however  parts of the West get extremely high amounts of rain and or snow  and still other parts are true desert and get less than 5 inches of rain per year  Also  the climate of the West is quite unstable  and areas that are normally wet can be very dry for years and vice versa  The seasonal temperatures vary greatly throughout the West  Low elevations on the West Coast have warm to very hot summers and get little to no snow  The Desert Southwest has very hot summers and mild winters  While the mountains in the southwest receive generally large amounts of snow  The Inland Northwest has a continental climate of warm to hot summers and cold to bitter cold winters  Annual rainfall is greater in the eastern portions  gradually tapering off until reaching the Pacific Coast where it again increases  In fact  the greatest annual rainfall in the United States falls in the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest  Drought is much more common in the West than the rest of the United States  The driest place recorded in the U S  is Death Valley  California  7  Violent thunderstorms occur east of the Rockies  Tornadoes occur every spring on the southern plains  with the most common and most destructive centered on Tornado Alley  which covers eastern portions of the West   Texas to North Dakota   and all states in between and to the east  Agriculture varies depending on rainfall  irrigation  soil  elevation  and temperature extremes  The arid regions generally support only livestock grazing  chiefly beef cattle  The wheat belt extends from Texas through the Dakotas  producing most of the wheat and soybeans in the U S  and exporting more to the rest of the world  Irrigation in the Southwest allows the growing of great quantities of fruits  nuts  and vegetables as well as grain  hay  and flowers  Texas is a major cattle and sheep raising area  as well as the nation s largest producer of cotton  Washington is famous for its apples  and Idaho for its potatoes  California and Arizona are major producers of citrus crops  although growing metropolitan sprawl is absorbing much of this land  Local state and Government officials started to understand  after several surveys made during the latter part of the 19th century  that only action by the federal government could provide water resources needed to support the development of the West citation needed   Starting in 1902  Congress passed a series of acts authorizing the establishment of the United States Bureau of Reclamation to oversee water development projects in seventeen western states  During the first half of the 20th century  dams and irrigation projects provided water for rapid agricultural growth throughout the West and brought prosperity for several states  where agriculture had previously only been subsistence level  Following World War II  the West s cities experienced an economic and population boom  The population growth  mostly in the Southwest states of New Mexico  Utah  Colorado  Arizona  and Nevada  has strained water and power resources  with water diverted from agricultural uses to major population centers  such as Las Vegas and Los Angeles   edit  Geology Plains make up most of the eastern half of the West  underlain with sedimentary rock from the Upper Paleozoic  Mesozoic  and Cenozoic eras  The Rocky Mountains expose igneous and metamorphic rock both from the Precambrian and from the Phanerozoic eon  The Inter mountain States and Pacific Northwest have huge expanses of volcanic rock from the Cenozoic era  Salt flats and salt lakes reveal a time when the great inland seas covered much of what is now the West  The Pacific states are the most geologically active areas in the United States  Earthquakes cause major damage every few years in California  While the Pacific states are the most volcanically active areas  extinct volcanoes and lava flows are found throughout most of the western half of the West   edit  History and culture Facing both the Pacific Ocean and the Mexican border  the West has been shaped by a variety of ethnic groups  Hawaii is the only state in the union in which Asian Americans outnumber white American residents  Asians from many countries have settled in California and other coastal states in several waves of immigration since the 19th century  contributing to the Gold Rush  the building of the transcontinental railroad  agriculture  and more recently  high technology  The border states California  Arizona  New Mexico  and Texas all have large Hispanic populations  and the many Spanish place names attest to their history as former Spanish and Mexican territories  Other southwestern states such as Colorado  Utah  and Nevada have large Hispanic populations as well  with many names places also attest to the history of former Mexican territories  Mexican Americans have also had a growing population in Northwestern states of Oregon and Washington  as well as the southern state of Oklahoma  The West also contains much of the Native American population in the U S   particularly in the large reservations in the mountain and desert states  Hollywood is a well known area of Los Angeles and the symbolic center of the American film industry  The largest concentrations for black Americans in the West can be found in Los Angeles  Oakland  Sacramento  San Francisco  Phoenix  Seattle  Las Vegas  Denver  and Colorado Springs  Alaska the northernmost state in the Union is a vast land of few people  many of them native  and of great stretches of wilderness  protected in national parks and wildlife refuges  Hawaii s location makes it a major gateway between the U S  and Asia  as well as a center for tourism  In the Pacific Coast states  the wide areas filled with small towns  farms  and forests are supplemented by a few big port cities which have evolved into world centers for the media and technology industries  Now the second largest city in the nation  Los Angeles is best known as the home of the Hollywood film industry  the area around Los Angeles also was a major center for the aerospace industry by World War II  though Boeing  located in Washington state would lead the aerospace industry  Fueled by the growth of Los Angeles as well as the San Francisco Bay area  including Silicon Valley the center of America s high tech industry California has become the most populous of all the states  Oregon and Washington have also seen rapid growth with the rise of Boeing and Microsoft along with agriculture and resource based industries  The desert and mountain states have relatively low population densities  and developed as ranching and mining areas which are only recently becoming urbanized  Most of them have highly individualistic cultures  and have worked to balance the interests of urban development  recreation  and the environment  Newspaper Rock State Historic Monument  Utah contains petroglyphs left by the first inhabitants of the American Southwest  Culturally distinctive points include the large Mormon population in the Mormon Corridor  including southeastern Idaho  Utah  Northern Arizona and Nevada  the extravagant casino resort towns of Las Vegas and Reno  Nevada  and  of course  the many Native American tribal reservations   edit  American Old West Main article  American Old West Major settlement of the western territories by migrants from the states in the east developed rapidly in the 1840s  largely citation needed  through the Oregon Trail and the California Gold Rush of 1849  California experienced such a rapid growth in a few short months that it was admitted to statehood in 1850 without the normal transitory phase of becoming an official territory  The largest citation needed  migration in American history occurred in the 1840s as the Latter Day Saints left the Midwest for the safety of the West  Both Omaha  Nebraska and St  Louis  Missouri laid claim to the title   Gateway to the West  during this period  Omaha  home to the Union Pacific Railroad and the Mormon Trail  made its fortunes on outfitting settlers  St  Louis built itself upon the vast fur trade in the West before its settlement  The 1850s were marked by political controversies which were part of the national issues leading to the Civil War  though California had been established as a non slave state in the Compromise of 1850  California played little role in the war itself due to its geographic distance from major campaigns  In the aftermath of the Civil War  many former Confederate partisans migrated to California during the end of the Reconstruction period  The history of the American West in the late 19th and early 20th centuries has acquired a cultural mythos in the literature and cinema of the United States citation needed   The image of the cowboy  the homesteader and westward expansion took real events and transmuted them into a myth of the west which has influenced American culture since at least the 1920s  Writers as diverse as Bret Harte and Zane Grey celebrated or derided cowboy culture  while artists such as Frederic Remington created western art as a method of recording the expansion into the west citation needed   The American cinema  in particular  created the genre of the western movie  which  in many cases  use the West as a metaphor for the virtue of self reliance and an American ethos  The contrast between the romanticism of culture about the West and the actuality of the history of the westward expansion has been a theme of late 20th and early 21st century scholarship about the West citation needed   Cowboy culture has become embedded in the American experience as a common cultural touchstone  and modern forms as diverse as country and western music and the works of artist Georgia O Keeffe have celebrated the supposed sense of isolation and independence of spirit inspired by the unpopulated and relatively harsh climate of the region citation needed   As a result of the various periods of rapid growth  many new residents were immigrants who were seeking to make a new start after previous histories of either personal failure or hostilities developed in their previous communities citation needed   With these and other migrants who harbored more commercial goals in the opening country  the area developed a strong ethos of self determinism and individual freedom citation needed   as communities were created whose residents shared no prior connection or common set of ideals and allegiances  The open land of the region allowed residents to live at a much greater distance from neighbors than had been possible in eastern cities  and an ethic of tolerance for the different values and goals of other residents developed  California s state constitutions  in both 1849 and 1879  were largely drafted by groups which sought a strong emphasis on individual property rights and personal freedom  arguably at the expense of ideals tending toward civic community citation needed    edit  The 20th century This article needs additional citations for

the automobile enabled the average American to tour the West  Western businessmen promoted U S  Route 66 as a means to bring tourism and industry to the West  In the 1950s  representatives from all the western states built the Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western Heritage Center to showcase western culture and greet travelers from the East  During the latter half of the 20th century  several transcontinental interstate highways crossed the West bringing more trade and tourists from the East  In the news  reports spoke of oil boom towns in Texas and Oklahoma rivaling the old mining camps for their lawlessness  of the Dust Bowl forcing children of the original homesteaders even further west  The movies replaced the dime novel as the chief entertainment source featuring western fiction  later the community of Hollywood  Los Angeles became the headquarters of the mass media such as radio and television production  California has emerged as the most populous state and one of the top 10 economies in the world  Massive late 19th 20th century population and settlement booms created two megalopolis areas of the Greater Los Angeles Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area Northern California regions  one of the USA s largest metropolitan areas and in the top 25 largest urban areas in the world  Three more metropolitan areas of Denver  Phoenix and Seattle have over a million residents  while the three fastest growing metro areas were Salt Lake City  Las Vegas  Nevada  and Portland  Oregon  Although there has been segregation  along with accusations of racial profiling and police brutality towards minorities due to issues such as illegal immigration and a racial shift  i e  White flight and now black flight  in neighborhood demographics  sometimes leading to racially based riots  i e  the 1992 Los Angeles Riots and 1965 Watts Riots   the West has a continuing reputation for being open minded and for being one of the most racially progressive areas in the United States  Los Angeles is said to have the largest Mexican population outside of Mexico  while San Francisco has the largest Chinese community in North America and also has a large Gay GLBT community  and Oakland  California has a large percentage of residents being African American  as well Long Beach  California has a large Black community  The state of Utah has a Mormon majority  estimated at 62 4  in 2004   9  while some cities like Albuquerque  New Mexico  Spokane  Washington  and Tucson  Arizona faces Indian Reservations of Native American tribes  and there are Alaskan

legalized medicinal marijuana before 2005  US States with legalized physician assisted suicide US States that have no income tax at the state level Further information  Coastal California and Left Coast The region s distance from historical centers of power in the East  and the celebrated  frontier spirit  of its settlers offer two clich s for explaining the region s independent  heterogeneous politics  Historically  the West was the first region to see widespread women s suffrage  California birthed both the property rights and conservation movements  and spawned such phenomena as the Taxpayer Revolt and the Berkeley Free Speech Movement  It has also produced three presidents  Herbert Hoover  Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan  The prevalence of libertarian political attitudes is widespread  For example  the majority of Western states have legalized medicinal marijuana  all but Utah  and Wyoming  and some forms of gambling  except Utah   Oregon and Washington have legalized physician assisted suicide  Most rural counties in Nevada allow licensed brothels  There is less resistance to the legal recognition of same sex unions  California  Hawaii  Nevada  Oregon  and Washington recognize them  The West Coast leans toward the Democratic Party  San Francisco s two main political parties are the Green Party and the Democratic Party  Seattle has historically been a center of radical left wing politics  Both the Democratic leaders of the Congress are from the region  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada  Interior areas are more Republican  with Alaska  Arizona  Idaho  Montana  Utah  and Wyoming being Republican strongholds  and Colorado  Nevada  and New Mexico being swing states  though more often than not  these states are carried by Republicans   The state of Arizona has been won by the Republican presidential candidate in every election except one since 1948  while the states of Idaho  Utah  and Wyoming have been won by the Republican presidential candidate in every election since 1964  As the fastest growing demographic group  Latinos are hotly contested by both parties  Immigration is an important political issue for this group  Backlash against illegal immigration led to the passage of California Proposition 187 in 1994  a ballot initiative which would have denied many public services to illegal immigrants  Association of this proposal with the California Republicans  especially incumbent governor Pete Wilson  drove many Hispanic voters to the Democrats  10   edit  See
