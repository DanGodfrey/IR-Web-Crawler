University The foundation of Northwestern University is traceable to a meeting on May 31  1850 of nine prominent Chicago businessmen  Methodist leaders and attorneys who had formed the idea of establishing a university to serve what had once been known as the Northwest Territory  On January 28  1851  the Illinois General Assembly granted a charter to the Trustees of the North Western University  making it the first chartered university in Illinois  10  11  a  The school s nine founders  all of whom were Methodists  three of them ministers   knelt in prayer and worship before launching their first organizational meeting  12  Although they affiliated the university with the Methodist Episcopal Church  they were committed to non sectarian admissions  believing that Northwestern should serve all people in the newly developing territory  13  John Evans  for whom Evanston is named  bought 379 acres  153 ha  of land along Lake Michigan in 1853  and Philo Judson developed plans for what would become the city of Evanston  The first building  Old College  opened on November 5  1855  14  To raise funds for construction  Northwestern sold  100  perpetual scholarships  entitling the purchaser and his heirs to free tuition  15  16  In 1873 the Evanston College for Ladies merged with Northwestern  and Frances Willard  who later gained fame as a suffragette and as one of the founders of the Woman s Christian Temperance Union  WCTU   became the school s first dean of women  Northwestern admitted its first women students in 1869  and the first woman was graduated in 1874  17  Willard Residential College  1938  is named in her honor  Northwestern fielded its first intercollegiate football team in 1882  later becoming a founding member of the Big Ten Conference  In the 1870s and 1880s  Northwestern affiliated itself with already existing schools of law  medicine  and dentistry in Chicago  As the university increased in wealth and distinction  and enrollments grew  these professional schools were integrated with the undergraduate college in Evanston  the result was a modern research university combining professional  graduate  and undergraduate programs  which gave equal weight to teaching and research  18  19  The Association of American Universities invited Northwestern to become a member in 1917  Deering Library  1933  Under Walter Dill Scott s presidency from 1920 to 1939  Northwestern began construction of an integrated campus in Chicago designed by James Gamble Rogers to house the professional schools  established the Kellogg School of Management  and built several prominent buildings on the Evanston campus  Dyche Stadium  now named Ryan Field  and Deering Library among others  In 1933  a proposal to merge Northwestern with the University of Chicago was considered but rejected  20  21  Northwestern played host to the first ever NCAA Men s Division I Basketball Championship game in 1939 in the

anthropologist Melville J  Herskovits founded the Program of African Studies at Northwestern  the first center of its kind at an American academic institution  22 J  Roscoe Miller s tenure as

near campus until 1972  26  27  Northwestern s exemption from state and municipal property tax obligations under its original charter has historically been a source of town and gown tension  Though government support for universities declined in the 1970s and 1980s  President Arnold R  Weber was able to stabilize university finances  leading to a revitalization of the campuses  As admissions to colleges and universities grew increasingly competitive in the 1990s and 2000s  President Henry S  Bienen s tenure saw a notable increase in the number and quality of undergraduate applicants  continued expansion of the facilities and faculty  and renewed athletic competitiveness  In 1999  Northwestern student journalists uncovered information exonerating Illinois death row inmate Anthony Porter two days before his scheduled execution  and the Innocence Project has since exonerated 10 more men  28  29  On January 11  2003  in a speech at Northwestern School of Law s Lincoln Hall  then Governor of Illinois George Ryan announced that he would commute the sentences of more than 150 death row inmates  30  The Latin phrase on Northwestern s seal  Quaecumque sunt vera  Whatsoever things are true  is drawn from the Epistle of Paul to the Philippians 4 8  while the Greek phrase inscribed on the pages of an open book is taken from the Gospel of John 1 14

Wildcats  Before 1924  they were known as  The Purple  and unofficially as  The Fighting Methodists   The name Wildcats was bestowed upon the university in 1924 by Wallace Abbey  a writer for the Chicago Daily Tribune who wrote that even in a loss to the University of Chicago   Football players had not come down from Evanston  wildcats would be a name better suited to  Coach Glenn  Thistletwaite s boys    111  The name was so popular that university board members made  wildcats  the official nickname just months later  In 1972  the student body voted to change the official nickname from  Wildcats  to  Purple Haze  but the new name never stuck  112  The mascot of Northwestern Athletics is Willie the Wildcat  The first mascot  however  was a live  caged bear cub from the Lincoln Park Zoo named Furpaw who was brought to the playing field on the day of a game to greet the fans  But after a losing season  the team  deciding that Furpaw was to blame for its misfortune  banished him from campus forever  Willie the Wildcat made his debut in 1933 first as a logo  and then in three dimensions in 1947  when members of the Alpha Delta fraternity dressed as wildcats during a Homecoming Parade  The Northwestern University Marching Band  NUMB  performs at all home football games and leads cheers in the student section and performs the Alma Mater at the end of the game
