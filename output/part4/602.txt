Transportation in the United States From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Transportation in the United States is facilitated by road  air  rail  and water networks  The vast majority of passenger travel occurs by automobile for shorter distances  and airplane or railroad for some people  for longer distances  In descending order  most cargoes travel by railroad  truck  pipeline  or boat  air shipping is typically used only for perishables and premium express shipments  Contents 1 Ownership and jurisdiction 2 Mode share 2 1 Passenger 2 2 Cargo 3 Safety 4

Mass transportation 16 References 17 External links  edit  Ownership and jurisdiction The overwhelming majority of roads in the United States are owned and maintained by state and local governments  Federally maintained roads are generally found only on federal lands  such as national parks  and at federal facilities  like military bases   The Interstate Highway System is funded by the federal government but maintained by state governments  There are a few private highways in the United States  which use tolls to pay for construction and maintenance  There are many local private roads  generally serving remote or insular residences  Passenger and freight rail systems  bus systems  water ferries  and dams may be under either public or private ownership and operation  Civilian airlines are all privately owned and financed  Most airports are owned and operated by local government authorities  but there are also some private airports  The Transportation Security Administration has provided security at most major airports since 2001  The United States Department of Transportation and its divisions provide regulation  supervision  and funding for all aspects of transportation  except for customs  immigration  and security  which are the responsibility of the United States Department of Homeland Security  Each state has its own Department of Transportation  which builds and maintains state highways  and depending upon the state  may either directly operate or supervise other modes of transportation  Aviation law is almost entirely a federal matter  while automobile traffic laws are enacted and enforced by state and local authorities  Economic jurisdiction over tidelands is shared between the state and federal governments  while the United States Coast Guard is the primary enforcer of law and security on US waterways   edit  Mode share In most American cities but not all  the majority of work commutes are made by singly occupied automobiles   edit

parcels and intermodal freight accounted for about 3  of the remainder  Air freight is commonly used only for perishables and premium express shipments  The difference in percentage of rail s share by ton miles and by weight  10  vs 38   is accounted for by the extreme efficiency of trains  A single railroad locomotive may pull fifty boxcars full of freight while a truck only pulls one  Trucks surpass trains in the weight category due their greater numbers  while trains surpass trucks in the ton miles category due to the vast distances they travel carrying large amounts of freight  Usually cargo  apart from petroleum and other bulk commodities  is imported in containers through seaports  then distributed by road and rail  The quasi governmental United States Postal Service has a monopoly on letter delivery  except for express services  but several large private companies such as FedEx and UPS compete in the package and cargo delivery market  Truck transport in Eastern

water and river transportation was primarily by sailing vessel  The United States population was centered on its Atlantic coast  with all major population centers located on a natural harbor or navigable waterway  Low population density between these centers resulted in a heavily reliance on coastwise and riverboat shipping  The first government expenditures on highway transportation were funded to speed the delivery of overland mail  such as the Boston Post Road between New York City and Boston  Due to the distances between these population centers and the cost to maintain the roads  many highways in the late 18th century and early 19th century were private turnpikes  Other highways were mainly unimproved and impassable by wagon at least some of the year  Economic expansion in the late 18th century to early 19th century spurred the building of canals to speed goods to market  of which the most prominently successful example was the Erie Canal  Access to water transportation shaped the geography of early settlements and boundaries  For example  the Erie Canal escalated the Toledo War between Ohio and Michigan in the 1830s  The disputed Erie Triangle was awarded to Pennsylvania to give it access to Lake Erie  Las Vegas is located on the Colorado River  which gives Nevada access to the Pacific Ocean  Most of West Florida was given to Mississippi and Alabama to guarantee their access to the Gulf of Mexico  Development of the mid western and southern states drained by the Mississippi River system  Mississippi  Ohio and Missouri Rivers  was accelerated by the introduction of steamboats on these rivers in the early 19th Century  These three rivers  among others  also form the borders of several states  Prior to the introduction of steamboats  transit upstream was impractical because of strong currents on parts of these waterways  Steamboats provided both passenger and freight transportation until the development of railroads later in the 19th Century gradually reduced their presence  The rapid expansion of Railroads brought the canal boom to a sudden end  providing a quick  scheduled and year round mode of transportation that quickly spread to interconnect the states by the mid 19th century  During the industrialization of the United States after the Civil War  railroads  led by the transcontinental rail system in the 1860s  expanded quickly across the United States to serve industries and the growing cities  During the late 19th century  railroads often had built redundant routes to a competitor s road or built through sparsely populated regions that generated little traffic  These marginal rail routes survived the pricing pressures of competition  or the lack of revenue generated by low traffic  as long as railroads provided the only efficient economical way to move goods and people across the United States  In addition to the intercity passenger network running on Class I and II railroads  a large network of interurban  trolley or  street running   rail lines extended out from the cities and interchanged passenger and freight traffic with the railroads and also provided competition  The advent of the automobile signaled the end of railroads as the predominant transportation for people and began an era of mobility in the United States that added greatly to its economic output  The early 20th century Lincoln Highway and other auto trails gave way in the 1920s to an early national highway system making the automobile the preferred mode of travel for most Americans  Interurban rail service declined  followed by trolley cars due in part to the advent of motorized buses and the lack of dedicated rights of way but also by deliberate efforts to dismantle urban rail infrastructure  see Great American streetcar scandal   The scarcity of industrial materials during World War II slowed the growth of the automobile  briefly reemphasizing much of the nation s declining rail network  In the 1950s  the United States renewed building a network of high capacity  high speed highways to link its vast territory  The most important element is the Interstate Highway system  first commissioned in the 1950s by President Dwight D  Eisenhower and modeled after the Italian autostrada and the German Autobahn system  With the advent of commercial airline industry  intercity rail began to suffer a loss of ridership  As the civil air transportation network of airports and other infrastructure expanded  air travel became more accessible to the general population  Technological advances ushered in the jet age  which increased airline capacity  while decreasing travel times and the cost of flights  The costs of flying rapidly decreased intercity rail ridership by the late 1960s to a point where railroads could no longer profitably operate networks of passenger trains  By the early 1970s almost all passenger rail operation and ownership had been transferred to various federal  municipal and state agencies  Passenger rail came to be heavily subsidized  as it is today  Freight railroads continued to decline as motor freight captured a significant portion of the less than carload business  This loss of business  when combined the highly regulated operating environment and constrained pricing power  forced many railroads into receivership and the nationalization of several critical eastern carriers into the Consolidated Rail Corporation  Conrail   Deregulation of the railroads by the Staggers Act in 1980 created a regulatory environment more favorable to the economics of the railroad industry  In the 1990s  the increase in foreign trade and intermodal container shipping led to a revival of the freight railroads  which have effectively consolidated into two eastern and two western private transportation networks  Union Pacific and BNSF in the west  and CSX and Norfolk Southern in the east  Canadian National Railway took over the Illinois Central route down the Misssippi River valley  Wartime expediency encouraged long distance pipeline transport of petroleum and natural gas  which was greatly expanded in the middle 20th century to take over most of the domestic long haul market   edit  Road transportation  edit  Infrastructure and private automobile use Further information  Numbered highways in the United States The Interstate highway system is the largest national controlled access highway network in the world  Maximum speed limits in the United States vary by state from 60 to 80 mph  In comparison to some parts of the Western world  the United States relies more heavily on its roads both for commercial and personal transit  Car ownership is nearly universal except in the largest cities where extensive mass transit and railroad systems have been built  With the development of the extensive Eisenhower Interstate Highway System in the 1950s  both long distance trips and daily the commute were mostly by private automobile  This network was designed to exacting federal standards in order to receive federal funding  The system  as of 2004 update   has a total length of 46 837 miles  75 376 km   9  making it both the largest controlled access highway system in the world and the largest public works project in US history  10  The Interstate system joined an existing National Highway System  a designation created for the legacy highway network in 1995   comprising 160 000 miles  256 000 kilometers  of roadway  a fraction of the total mileage of roads  The Interstate system serves nearly all major U S  cities  often through the downtown areas  a point which triggered freeway and expressway revolts in the 1960s and 1970s   The distribution of virtually all goods and services involves Interstate highways at some point  11  Residents of American cities commonly use urban Interstates to travel to their places of work  The vast majority of long distance travel  whether for vacation or business  is by the national road network  12  of these trips  about one third  by the total number of miles driven in the country in 2003  utilize the Interstate system  13  In addition to the routes of the Interstate system  there are those of the US Highway system  not to be confused with the above mentioned National Highway System  These networks are further supplemented by State Highways  and the local roads of counties  municipal streets  and federal agencies  such as the Bureau of Indian Affairs  Altogether there are more than 4 209 835 km of paved roads in the U S   including 75 040 km of limited access roads   and 2 255 964 km of unpaved roads  14  All highways are maintained by state governments  although they receive federal aid to build and maintain freeways signed as part of the 46 000 mile  75 000 km  nationwide Interstate highway network  A large number of expressways are actually government or privately operated toll roads in many East Coast and Midwestern states  West Coast freeways are generally free to users   freeways   no toll charged per use   although since the 1990s there have been some small experiments with toll roads operated by private companies  After the collapse of the I 35W Mississippi River bridge in Minnesota in August 2007  the backlog of road and bridge maintenance across the country became a prominent political issue  As of 2010  seat belt use is mandatory in all states except New Hampshire  15   edit  Intercity bus Greyhound Lines is the largest intercity bus company 16  in the United States  with routes in all parts of the continental U S   There are also many smaller regional bus companies  many of which use the terminal and booking facilities provided by Greyhound  Intercity bus is  in most cases  the least expensive citation needed  way to travel long distances in the US   edit  Congestion A traffic jam on a typical American freeway  the Santa Monica Freeway in Los Angeles  Traffic congestion  especially at rush hour  is a problem in many of the country s larger cities  A 2009 study found that traffic congestion costs the US almost  87 2 billion  The economic costs of traffic congestion have increased 63  over the past decade  and despite declining traffic volumes  caused by the economic downturn  Americans still waste more than 2 8 billion US gallons  11 000 000 m3  of fuel each year as a result of traffic congestion  Motorists also waste 4 2 billion hours annually  or one full work week per traveler  17   edit  Cargo See also  Trucking industry in the United States The trucking industry  also referred to as the transportation or logistics industry  involves the transport and distribution of commercial and industrial goods using commercial motor vehicles  CMV   In this case  CMVs are most often trucks  usually semi trucks  box trucks  or dump trucks  A truck driver  commonly referred to as a  trucker   is a person who earns a living as the driver of a CMV  The trucking industry provides an essential service to the American economy by transporting large quantities of raw materials  works in process  and finished goods over land typically from manufacturing plants to retail distribution centers  Trucks are also important to the construction industry  as dump trucks and portable concrete mixers are necessary to move the large amounts of rocks  dirt  concrete  and other building materials used in construction  Trucks in America are responsible for the majority of freight movement over land  and are vital tools in the manufacturing  transportation  and warehousing industries  Large trucks and buses require a commercial driver s license  CDL  to operate  Obtaining a CDL requires extra education and training dealing with the special knowledge requirements and handling characteristics of such a large vehicle  Drivers of CMVs must adhere to the hours of service  which are regulations governing the driving hours of commercial drivers  These  and all other rules regarding the safety of interstate commercial driving  are issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration  FMCSA   The FMCSA is also a division of the United States Department of Transportation  USDOT   which governs all transportation related industries such as trucking  shipping  railroads  and airlines  Some other issues are handled by another branch of the USDOT  the Federal Highway Administration  FHWA   Developments in technology  such as computers  satellite communication  and the internet  have contributed to many improvements within the industry  These developments have increased the productivity of company operations  saved the time and effort of drivers  and provided new  more accessible forms of entertainment to men and women who often spend long periods of time away from home  In 2006  the U S  Environmental Protection Agency implemented revised emission standards for diesel trucks  reducing airborne pollutants emitted by diesel engines  which promises to improve air quality and public health   edit  Roadway links with adjacent countries and non contiguous parts of the US Canada   Yes  Mexico   Yes  Alaska   Yes  via Canada and the Alaska Marine Highway in

Air transportation An aircraft from the United States landing at London Heathrow Airport  Traveling by air is the most popular means of long distance passenger travel in the US  The United States has advanced air transportation infrastructure which utilizes approximately 5 000 paved runways  In terms of passengers  seventeen of the world s thirty busiest airports in 2004 were in the U S   including the world s busiest  Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport  In terms of cargo  in the same year  twelve of the world s thirty busiest airports were in the U S   including the world s busiest  Memphis International Airport  19  Private aircraft are also used for medical emergencies  government agencies  large businesses  and individuals  see general aviation   Due to the geography of the United States and the generally large distances between major cities  air transportation is the preferred method of travel for trips over 300 miles  480 km   such as for business travelers and long distance vacation travelers  For cities closer together  such as Boston and New York City  New York and Washington D C   and Philadelphia and D C   air travel does not carry the majority of intercity traffic  citation needed  There is no single national flag airline  passenger airlines in the United States have always been privately owned  There are over 200 domestic passenger and cargo airlines and a number of international carriers  The major international carriers of the U S  are Delta Air Lines  American Airlines  United Airlines and US Airways  There is currently no government regulation of ticket pricing  although the federal government retains jurisdiction over aircraft safety  pilot training  and accident investigations  through the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board   The Transportation Security Administration provides security at airports  With numerous airlines competing for traffic on the same intercity routes  ticket prices tend to be very competitive  resulting in low industry profit margins  citation needed  This has led to frequent airline bankruptcies when ridership declines during economic recessions  jet fuel price increases  and other developments such as the September 11th terrorist attacks  Many airlines operate on a  hub and spoke  model  This system gives the predominant airline in a given airport a strong competitive position as it feeds passengers to and from the hub  maximizing the number of passengers on each flight  Examples of airline hubs include United Airlines in Chicago  Delta Air Lines in Atlanta  US Airways in Charlotte  American Airlines in Dallas  Public airports are usually constructed and operated by local governments  The main exceptions are on military bases  Like highways and passenger rail  the federal government subsidizes air travel with  14 billion of federal funds going to airport operations in 2002  20  Air cargo comprises a large number of daily flights in the United States and are operated by private parcel companies such as FedEx and United Parcel Service  These organizations operate some of the largest fleets in the world  Most air cargo moved by these organizations is time sensitive overnight and 2nd day parcels  The U S  Postal Service also moves much of its letters and time sensitive parcels via air  but on regularly scheduled passenger flights  At one time the U S  Mail charged a premium for letters sent by airmail  but no longer does so except for overnight express mail  Further information

the average duration of delay experienced by these passengers was 1 hour 54 minutes  23  24  of flights were delayed and 2  were cancelled entirely  24  Overall  passengers were delayed 320 million hours in 2007 with an estimated deadweight economic loss of up to  41 billion  25  An average of 40  of passenger aircraft delays in the U S  originated in the New York metropolitan area  some in the area and others due to cascading effects  23  One third of aircraft in the national airspace system move through the New York area at some point during a typical day  25  To deal with delays  takeoff and landing scheduling caps have been imposed on certain urban airports at various times since 1968  including Washington Reagan National  Chicago O Hare  and the three New York airports  26  Other short term measures have been taken  including minor procedural changes  use of military airspace on peak travel days  and appointment of a  New York Airspace Czar   Director for the New York Area Program Integration Office   The New York New Jersey Philadelphia airspace is being  redesigned  incrementally  with completion estimated in 2012  27  The Bush Administration announced plans to auction some takeoff and landing slots at the New York airports  but plans were canceled by the Obama administration  Longer term solutions include increasing capacity by building more runways  and implementing the Next Generation Air Transportation System which would allow more direct flight paths   edit  Network statistics Airports  14 951  2008 est   14  Airports with paved runways  Total  5

City Passenger trains were the dominant mode of transportation until the mid twentieth century  The introduction of jet airplanes on major U S  routes and the completion of the Interstate Highway system accelerated a decline in intercity rail passenger demand during the 1960s  resulting in the sharp curtailment of passenger service by private railroads  This led to the creation of National Railroad Passenger Corporation  branded as Amtrak  by the Federal Government in 1971 to maintain limited intercity rail passenger service in most parts of the country  Amtrak serves most major cities but  outside of the Northeast  California  and Illinois  often by only few trains per day  Amtrak does not serve several major destinations  including Las Vegas  Nevada and Phoenix  Arizona  Frequent service is available in regional corridors between certain major cities  particularly the Northeast Corridor between Washington  D C   New York City and Boston  between New York City and Albany  around Chicago  and in parts of California and the Pacific Northwest  The Alaska Railroad is the only other intercity passenger railroad still operating  and it has no connections with Amtrak  See

world s busiest  moving more freight than any rail system in any other country  In fact  U S  railroads move more than four times as much freight as do all of Western Europe s freight railroads combined   Nearly all railroad corridors  not including local transit rail systems  are owned by private companies that provide freight service  Amtrak pays these companies for the right to use the tracks for passenger service  There are approximately 150 000 mi  240 000 km  of mainline track in the United States   the world s longest national railroad network  See List of United States

Government funding of transportation exists at many levels  Federal funding for highway  rail  bus  water  air  and other forms of transportation is allocated by Congress for several years at a time  The current authorization bill is the Safe  Accountable  Flexible  Efficient Transportation Equity Act  A Legacy for Users  SAFETEA LU   which runs from 2005 to 2009  A Congressionally chartered committee is considering future funding issues  38  Though earmarks are often made for specific projects  the allocation of most federal dollars is controlled by metropolitan planning organizations  MPOs  and state governments  Usually  matching  funds are required from local sources  All projects have a sponsoring agency that will receive the funding from the various federal and local sources  and be responsible for implementing the project directly or through contracts  Large projects require a Major Investment Study and a both a Draft and a Final Environmental Impact Review  A patchwork of federal laws and accounts govern the allocation of federal transportation dollars  most of which is reserved for capital projects  not operating expenses  Some roads are federally designated as part of the National Highway System and get preferential funding as a result  but there are few federally maintained roads outside of Washington D C  and national parks  State governments are sovereign entities which use their powers of taxation both to match federal grants  and provide for local transportation needs  Different states have different systems for dividing responsibility for funding and maintaining road and transit networks between the state department of transportation  counties  municipalities  and other entities  Typically cities or counties are responsible for local roads  financed with block grants and local property taxes  and the state is responsible for major roads that receive state and federal designations  Many mass transit agencies are quasi independent and subsidized branches of a state  county  or city government   edit  Economic impact According to the U S  Department of Transportation  DOT    Transportation s vital importance to the U S  economy is underscored by the fact that more than  1 out of every  10 produced in the U S  gross domestic product is related to transportation activity  This includes all aspects of transportation  including the movement of goods and the purchase of all transportation related products and services as well as the movement of people   39  Employment in the transportation and material moving industry accounted for 7 4  of all employment  and was the 5th largest employment group in the United States  40  The US invests 0 6  of its GDP on transportation annually  41   edit  Environmental impacts Two thirds of U S  oil consumption is due to the transportation sector  42  43  The  Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007  has a significant impact on U S  Energy Policy  44  The US   an important export country for food stocks   will convert 18  of its grain output to ethanol in 2008  Across the US  25  of the whole corn crop went to ethanol in 2007  45  The percentage of corn going to biofuel is expected to go up  46  In 2006  U S  Senators introduced the BioFuels Security Act  which would mandate the production of dual fuel vehicles and the sale of E85 ethanol fuel  47   edit  See also
