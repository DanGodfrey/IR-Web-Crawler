Nora Allen  Barry Allen is a police scientist  his job title was changed to a forensic scientist in The Flash  Iron Heights one shot  with a reputation for being very slow  deliberate  and frequently late  which frustrates his fiancee  Iris West  One night  as he is preparing to leave work  a lightning bolt shatters a case full of chemicals and spills them all over Allen  As a result  Allen finds that he can run extremely fast and has matching reflexes  He dons a set of red tights sporting a lightning bolt  dubs himself the Flash  after his childhood comic book hero  Jay Garrick   and becomes Central City s resident costumed crimefighter  1  Central City University professor Ira West  Iris  adoptive father  designed Allen s costume  reminiscent of the original Fawcett Captain Marvel  and the ring which stores it while Allen is in his civilian identity  3  The ring can eject the compressed clothing when Allen needs it and suck it back in with the aid of a special gas that shrinks the suit  In addition  Allen invented the cosmic treadmill  a device that allowed for precise time travel and was used in many stories  Allen was so well liked that nearly all speedsters that come after him are often compared to him  Batman once said  Barry is the kind of man that I would ve hoped to become if my parents hadn t been murdered   volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Justice League As presented in Justice League of America  9  when the Earth is infiltrated by alien warriors sent to conquer the planet  some of the world s greatest heroes join forces Allen is one of them  While the superheroes individually defeat most of the invaders  they fall prey to a single alien and only by working together are they able to defeat the warrior  Afterwards the heroes decide to found the Justice League of America  During the years  he is depicted as feeling attracted to Black Canary and Zatanna  but he never pursues a relationship because he feels his real love is Iris West  Allen also becomes good friends with Green Lantern  Hal Jordan   which would later be the subject of the limited series Flash and Green Lantern  The Brave and the Bold  In The Flash   123    Flash of Two Worlds     Allen is transported to Earth Two where he meets Jay Garrick  the original Flash in DC Continuity  it is revealed that Jay Garrick s adventures were captured in comic book form on Earth One  This storyline initiated DC s multiverse and was continued in issues of Flash and in team ups between the Justice League of America of Earth One and the Justice Society of America of Earth Two  In the classic story from Flash  179    The Flash   Fact or Fiction     Allen is thrown into the universe eventually called Earth Prime  a representation of  our  universe  where he seeks the aid of the Flash comic book s editor Julius Schwartz to build a cosmic treadmill so that he can return home  He also gains a sidekick and protoge in Iris  nephew  Wally West  who gains super speed in an accident similar to that which gave Allen his powers   edit  Tragedy In time  he married his girlfriend Iris  who learned of his double identity because Allen talked in his sleep  She kept this secret  and he eventually revealed his identity to her of his own free will  Iris was eventually revealed to have been sent as a child from the 30th century and adopted  In the 1980s  Flash s life begins to collapse  Iris is murdered by Professor Zoom  a supervillain from the 25th century who had long loved her and been jealous of Allen   and when Allen prepares to marry another woman  Zoom tries the same trick again  Allen stops him  killing Zoom in the process by breaking his neck  Unfortunately  due to Barry being unable to make an appearance at his own wedding  his fianc e eventually descends into madness  Placed on trial for murder in connection with Zoom s death  Allen is found guilty by the jury  When he is told by a juror  who is being possessed by a mind from the future  that Reverse Flash  who Allen knows to be dead  brainwashed the jury into this verdict  Flash flees his trial  The Flash is then attacked by Reverse Flash  and realizes that the answers to this mystery  and restoring his good name  lie in the future  so the juror uses a time device to send them forward  They discover that Abra Kadabra was disguised as Reverse Flash to ruin the Flash s good name  Defeating Kadabra  he retreats to the future to be reunited with Iris  having learned that Iris  spirit was in fact drawn to the 30th century  and given a new body  and was in fact the mind inhabiting the juror   The final issue of The Flash ends with Flash and Iris kissing passionately and the caption  And they lived happily ever after    for a while   There are a few references in the final issue  The Flash  350  to the upcoming events  and Flash s impending death  1  Years later  in the controversial storyline Identity Crisis  it is revealed that Barry voted to allow Zatanna to edit Dr  Light s mind with the rest of the Justice League six months after Iris s death  essentially lobotomized him  Unfortunately  when Batman discovers what the League was doing  they have his memories edited as well  Both Dr  Light and Batman would eventually recover from their respective mindwipe  leading Dr  Light to swear vengeance to all heroes and Batman s distrust towards his allies   edit  Crisis on Infinite Earths Main article  Crisis on Infinite Earths Following the trial  Allen retires and joins Iris in the 30th century  However  after only a few weeks of happiness  the Crisis on Infinite Earths intervenes  and Allen is captured by the Anti Monitor and brought to 1985  according to the Anti Monitor  the Flash was the only being capable of travelling to other universes at will  so the Anti Monitor could not allow him to stay free  Allen escapes and foils the Anti Monitor s plan to destroy the Earth with an anti matter cannon  creating a speed vortex to draw the power in  but dies in the process as the power becomes too much for his body  1  It has been said that Allen travels back through time and becomes the very same lightning bolt that gives him his powers  but later it is also strongly implied that the soul of Barry resides in the Speed Force  the mystical source and Valhalla open to all dead speedsters  and from which the living ones draw their amazing powers  After Allen s death  Wally West  his nephew and sidekick  known as Kid Flash   takes up the mantle of the Flash  4   edit  After death Marv Wolfman  scribe for the Crisis on Infinite Earths  has repeatedly stated  first hinted at in his introduction to the original Crisis collected edition hardcover   then fully explained on his website that he left a loophole in the script wherein the Barry Allen Flash could be reintroduced  without a retcon  into DC Universe continuity  5  This loophole would allow a writer to pull Barry out of his desperate run to annihilate the anti matter cannon  However  Barry would know he must someday finish his death run  and would become more determined to use his speed to help others  It should also be noted that the way Barry Allen seemed to have  died  in Crisis on Infinite Earths  was that he ran so fast that he was able to stop the Anti Monitor s anti matter cannon from firing by catching the tachyon beam at the heart of the weapon  After this act  according to Secret Origins Annual  2  1988   Barry Allen turns into a lightning bolt  goes back in time  becoming the lightning bolt that hit his lab  splashing his past self with chemicals and transforming him into the Flash  6  In Deadman  Dead Again  Barry is one of the heroes whose spirit Deadman helps to enter Heaven  and the Green Arrow storyline  Quiver  depicts Barry Allen in Heaven  His spirit  however  seems to still be alive within the Speed Force  along with Max Mercury and other speedsters   edit  Legacy Iris is pregnant when Allen dies  and she has two children who have super speed powers  the Tornado Twins  who later meet the Legion of Super Heroes  In the multiversal variant known as Earth 247  each of her children themselves have children with speed based abilities  One  Jenni Ognats  grows up to become the Legionnaire XS  while the other  Bart Allen  is born with an accelerated metabolism that rapidly ages him  and is sent back to the 20th century where he is cured by Wally West  He remains there as the superhero Impulse under the tutelage of Max Mercury  and later becomes the second Kid Flash as a member of the Teen Titans  One year after the events of Infinite Crisis  Bart becomes the fourth Flash until he is abruptly killed by his clone Inertia and the Rogues  7  Wally then retook the identity of the Flash  8  Bart would later be resurrected as Kid Flash by the Legion of Super Heroes in the 31st century to combat Superboy Prime  9   edit  Post Crisis appearances Wally West  wracked by grief for the loss of his unborn twins at the hands of Zoom  regrets the public knowledge of his identity  Barry appears from somewhere in time  counseling him  and talking the Spectre into granting his wish  He then disappears  telling his nephew that he will come to his aid three times  on the three most difficult days of his life  In fact  when Zoom enlists the aid of the original Professor Zoom to make Wally relive the loss of his beloved twins  Barry is already there  trying to stop his own Reverse Flash  The evidence suggests that Zoom rescued Thawne from the attack that lead to Barry killing him originally  this Barry expressing surprise at Wally having become the Flash   For the second time  he helps Wally to undo the damage dealt by Zoom  also allowing Wally to save his twins  and then he returns to his proper time  He reappears a third and final time to come to his nephew s aid in the Final Crisis of mankind  ultimately having returned permanently due to Professor Zoom s machinations  Because this was  for Barry  the second time he met Wally after his own death  it appears that sometime in the future he will go on to return to the past  talk to Wally and the Spectre and promise to return  closing the time loop   edit  Infinite Crisis Main article  Infinite Crisis In the fourth issue of Infinite Crisis  Barry Allen comes out from the Speed Force  along with Johnny Quick and Max Mercury  to help his grandson Bart deal with Superboy Prime  taking the villainous teen with him in the Speed Force  Bart Allen appears wearing Barry Allen s costume in Tokyo near the end of Infinite Crisis  5 to tell the heroes that Superboy Prime has escaped the Speed Force  Bart again reappears in Infinite Crisis  7 in Barry Allen s costume to combat Superboy Prime once more  In Flash  The Fastest Man Alive  6  2006   with a portion taking place shortly before Infinite Crisis  5  it is told how Barry spent four years in an alternate Keystone City along with Max Mercury  Johnny Quick  and an alternate Jay Garrick  until he met Bart and Wally West  joining him after the battle against Superboy Prime  After Superboy escapes  Barry suggests that someone has to absorb the whole Speed Force and cross the dimensional bridge back to Post Crisis Earth  As Bart volunteers  Barry gives him his suit as a last gift  to keep the Force contained  and stays behind  Wally West did not go because of his wife and kids  Bart says he knows Barry would go if he could  but why Barry Allen could not make the journey himself is not stated   edit  Return Barry Allen returns to the DC Universe  fleeing the Black Racer  Art from Final Crisis  2 by J  G  Jones  Twenty three years after his death in Crisis on Infinite Earths  Barry Allen s essence made a return to the present DC Universe proper in DC Universe  0  preceding his full time return in the pages of writer Grant Morrison s Final Crisis  DC Universe  0 features an unnamed narrator who initially associates himself with  everything   As the story progresses  he begins to recall his past and association with Justice League members  particularly Hal Jordan and Superman  The lettering in which he speaks to the reader is yellow on backgrounds that are initially black  As the story moves forward  the background slowly begins turning red  In the final pages  the narration boxes feature a yellow lightning bolt  Over time  as he recalls friendships and connections with other people  his mind begins to narrow  remarking  I   know him  I am no longer everything  I am a shaft of light split through a prism   Yet he is still the only one able to see  the shadow falling over everything   in the form of Darkseid  On the final page  the moon appears in front of a red sky  as a yellow lightning bolt strikes diagonally in front of it creating the logo of the Flash  as he remarks  and now I remember   The title of the story is revealed to be  Let There Be Lightning   10  A Daily News story released on the same day proclaimed that Barry Allen has returned to life  with issue co writer Geoff Johns stating   When the greatest evil comes back to the DC Universe  the greatest hero needed to return   11   edit  Final Crisis Main article  Final Crisis Barry makes his corporeal return in Final Crisis  2  On the second to last page  Jay Garrick and Wally West feel vibrations to which Jay remarks   Wally  don t you recognize those vibrations  It can t be    Not after all these years    Not after all this time   On the final page  Barry Allen is seen in hot pursuit of the bullet which kills Orion  outrunning the Black Racer and shouting to Jay and Wally to  Run   12  During Final Crisis  3  Jay Garrick speaks to Barry s wife  Iris  and tells her that her husband is truly alive  Meanwhile  Wally and Barry run a few weeks into the future  When they come to rest  Wally asks Barry if it is really him  Lamenting on Orion s death  which he was unable to stop  Barry wonders why he is now alive after being dead for so long  It is then that Barry and Wally are confronted by Wonder Woman  Batwoman  Catwoman  and Giganta  who have all been transformed into the new Female Furies following the release of the Anti Life Equation  13  Despite the fact that this new version of the Female Furies is equipped with the ability to track down speedsters  perceived by Libra and Darkseid as the only obstacle left between them and world domination  Barry s expertise allows him to overcome their foes and run through the ruined Earth  Barry stops to see his wife Iris and save her from the slavery of the Anti Life Equation  Seeing his wife again for the first time in years  Barry is overcome with emotion and gives his brainwashed wife a deep kiss  While kissing her  the Speed Force sparkles out of his body  enveloping Iris and freeing her from the Equation  The Allens and Wally West are left to fend in a conquered world  14  In the seventh and final issue of Final Crisis  Barry and Wally lead the Black Racer to Darkseid  dealing the cosmic tyrant a blow that  coupled with Batman shooting him in the shoulder with the god bullet  would facilitate his ultimate defeat  15   edit  The Flash  Rebirth Main article  The Flash  Rebirth In 2009  writer Geoff Johns and artist Ethan Van Sciver created The Flash  Rebirth  a 6 issue miniseries bringing Barry Allen back to a leading role in the DC Universe as the Flash  much in the same vein as Green Lantern  Rebirth  When asked what Flashes would appear in the series  Johns and Van Sciver said   All of them   The series begins with the cities of Central and Keystone celebrating the return of   Central City s Flash   Wonder Woman having used her government contacts to create the story that Barry was in witness protection to account for his resurrection  Avoiding the parades  parties  and other celebrations of his return  Barry instead contemplates why he is alive again  A visit to the Flash Museum and from his friend Hal Jordan is not enough to put his mind at ease as he runs off as the Flash   I can t be late   he says  When asked by Hal late for what  Flash replies   For whatever the rest of the world needs me for   It is then revealed that Flash s mother was murdered when he was a child  and his father was arrested for the crime  this is pointedly contrary to the original  pre Crisis Barry Allen stories  in which both his parents appear alive   Flash describes this as  the only one open case I left behind   Before he can contemplate this any further  the speedster villain Savitar escapes the Speed Force through Flash  When Flash manages to put his hand on Savitar s shoulder  the villain screams in agony and crumbles into dust  not before telling Flash      You were the beginning  Allen   and you re the end   At that moment  Wally West  West s children Iris and Jai  Liberty Belle  Jay Garrick  and Kid Flash all experience painful convulsions and are engulfed in lightning  16  Barry s conflict with the speed cult clarification needed  culminates in the death of their new leader who was attempting to avenge Savitar s death  It causes pain once again to all the speedsters  though Wally West manages to catch a glimpse of Allen directly afterwards  and sees him as the new Black Flash  17  When he realizes that his presence could damage or kill other innocents  Barry flees back into the Speed Force  where he encounters old friends Johnny Quick and Max Mercury  Max attempts to tell Allen that his becoming the Black Flash is not his fault  When Max and Barry are pulled into another pocket of the Speed Force  the real culprit reveals himself  Professor Zoom  18  Zoom reveals his plan  after Barry briefly aided Kid Flash against Superboy Prime during the Infinite Crisis  Thawne was able to send a subliminal pulse into the Speed Force to draw back what was left of Barry s self awareness  This led to the hero s reappearance during the Final Crisis  Afterward  Zoom transformed himself into  a new kind of speedster and created his negative Speed Force to contaminate Barry and the other heroic speedsters  Before Barry can fight any further  Zoom fades away  Wally enters the Speed Force to retrieve his uncle  and after venturing deeper into the Speed Force  Max reveals to Barry that it was Allen himself who created the Speed Force  Meanwhile  Wally manages to reach Barry and Max  and the three begin their escape  As the heroic speedsters are recharged with energy  Barry  Wally  Jay  Max  and Bart charge towards Zoom  19  The seven speedsters battle against Zoom  and despite being outnumbered  Zoom pulls Barry away  He reveals that everything horrible that happened to Barry  including the murder of Barry s mother  was caused by Zoom  Zoom then decides to destroy everything by killing Barry s wife  Iris  before they met  20  Barry chases after Zoom  and is joined by Wally  who tells Barry to push as hard as he can to break the time barrier  They reach Thawne  becoming the lightning bolt that turns Barry into the Flash as they are able to stop Zoom from killing Iris  As the two Flashes push Zoom back through time to the present  they see that the Justice League  the Justice Society  and the Outsiders have built a device specifically for Thawne  Barry tosses him in and activates the device  severing his connection to the negative Speed Force  The Flashes tie Zoom up to stop him from running  With the threat ended  everyone celebrates by welcoming Barry back and the speedsters in general  Later  Barry closes the case on his mother s death and opts to take all the other cold cases they had after his death  Barry spends some time with Iris before racing to Washington to celebrate his return with the Justice League  apologizing for being late  21   edit  Blackest Night Main article  Blackest Night Barry Allen as a member of the Blue Lantern Corps during the Blackest Night event  Cover art to Blackest Night  The Flash  3 by Scott Kolins  Barry Allen is one of the main characters in Blackest Night alongside Hal Jordan  the Silver Age Green Lantern  Allen appears alongside Hal Jordan in the Free Comic Book Day issue Blackest Night  0 that acts as a prologue to the July company crossover  At the grave of Bruce Wayne in Gotham City  Hal Jordan and Barry Allen reflect on Batman s death and how the hero community is avoiding linking Wayne and Batman  This reflection turns to the pair looking at their own deaths  comparing the sadness that Barry s death engendered in others while Hal s death produced anger  Hal sums it up by telling Barry   I died a sinner  You died a saint   The conversation moves on to the world becoming  more dangerous  after Barry s death and observing that the deaths of Arthur Curry and Martian Manhunter cost the Justice League its  heart and soul   As they leave the cemetery  Barry expresses hope that their dead comrades will be returned to them  He specifically cites Batman noting   If there s an escape  you can bet Batman s already planning it   22  Barry also appears alongside Hal in the July issues of Green Lantern tying into the event  Recently  in a fight with Black Lantern J onn J onzz  he found a mysterious black residue at Bruce Wayne s grave a black form coagulating much like blood that started corrupting him by partly decaying his skin and muscle during the fight against his former friend  who is intent on killing both Hal and Barry  seeing how they both died  and in the eyes of the Black Lanterns  must return to that state to keep the universe in balance  23  24  After fighting off the undead Martian and the subsequent Black Lanterns with Hal and the arriving Atom  Mera  Firestorm  and two of the Indigo Tribe members  Barry  along with Wally and Bart  races across the globe to warn every superhero community across the planet  25  His message also inadvertently warns the Rogues  They all realize that their deceased members would come after them and decide to strike first at Iron Heights Penitentiary  unaware that the undead Rogues are ready for them  While doing so  Barry meets a Black Lantern version of Professor Zoom for a brief battle  Barry decides to go to Gorilla City to seek aid from its ruler Solovar  unaware the gorilla leader had been killed years before  Finding the city attacked  Barry assumed Grodd had struck only to be horrified to learn Solovar was now a Black Lantern  Their fight was shortened by Barry racing to Coast City  26  He stops at the city s memorial  where he witnesses the arrival of the Black Lanterns  demonic lord  Nekron  and his disciples Scar and Black Hand  27  The Justice League  the Titans  Wally  and Bart arrive to aid Barry to take a stand against Nekron  Nekron reveals however that all the resurrected heroes are tied to him  because he allowed them to rise again  As such they belong to him  Nekron then used a series of black rings to turn Superman  Green Arrow  Bart  and several other resurrected heroes into Black Lanterns  Barry and Hal find themselves being targeted by black rings and are forced to flee or risk joining the others as Black Lanterns  28  Barry manages to save himself and Hal through time travel two seconds forward  leaving the rings with no present targets  As Barry and Hal rejoin the heroes against Nekron and his army  Ganthet  one of the Guardians of the Universe and a leader of the Blue Lantern Corps  summons a blue power ring and Barry is chosen as a Blue Lantern so he would be more effective during the battle  29  After being chosen as a Blue Lantern  Barry joins forces with the veteran Blue Corps member Saint Walker to continue battling the Black Lanterns alongside the understanding of the potentials and limitations of his new power ring  During the battle  Barry is forced to fight his own grandson  who his ring detects is still alive but would eventually die if not free from the black ring soon  Barry is shown to be skilled with his ring in creating energy constructs based on his imagination and an ability of flight  possibly because of the understanding with his friend Hal Jordan s ring   as he is able to create images of Bart as Impulse and Kid Flash against him in order to make him feel again  Barry s plan almost works as Bart reacts to the images of his past and the constructs begin to attempt to take the black ring from him  but later is interrupted by the Black Lantern Professor Zoom and Solovar  Wally and Walker later join Barry to fight against them  30  Barry and Bart temporarily joined the White Lantern Corps during the final events of Blackest Night  31   edit  The Flash Volume 3 Main article  The Flash  comic book  Volume 3  2010 2011  The new Flash series begins after the completion of Blackest Night and the beginning of Brightest Day  After the events of The Flash  Rebirth  Barry Allen is reintegrating himself into life in Central City  Under the cover of having been in witness protection  Allen returns to the Central City Police Department s crime lab and returns to the streets as the Flash  While readjusting to life as the Flash  a man appears out of thin air in the costume of Flash rogue the Mirror Master  and promptly dies on the street  When Barry arrives on the scene to investigate  he sees the man is neither original Mirror Master Sam Scudder  or the current Rogue  Evan McCulloch  Hearing of another portal appearing  Barry transforms into the Flash and runs to investigate  When he arrives  a group of people in costumes similar to the Rogues  called The Renegades appear and tell Barry that they are from the 25th century  and that he is under arrest for murdering the  Mirror Monarch   Barry tells the crew that he has not killed anyone  to which their leader   Commander Cold   tells him   Not yet  But you will   32  After a brief struggle  the Renegades retreat but accidentally destroy an apartment building in their jump back to the 25th century  Barry saves everyone in the building  even rebuilding the building in minutes  and goes on to search for the true killer of Mirror Monarch  He is attacked again by the Renegades  but only before Captain Boomerang shows up  now wielding explosive energy boomerangs  Boomerang fights both the Flash and the Renegades  and a confused Top  one of the Renegades from the 25th century  questions his teammates on whether or not Barry Allen is the man they are looking for  pointing out that in their timeline  Boomerang never showed up  The Renegades finally corner Captain Boomerang when the Rogues arrive with a giant mirror left by the previous Mirror Master that says  In Case The Flash Returns Break Glass   An all out brawl ensues as the Rogues battle the Renegades  Meanwhile Flash is confronted by Top who warns him that the reason he will eventually kill Mirror Monarch is because of Iris s death  which he claims will be caused when the giant mirror breaks  releasing the Mirror Lords  Top tells Barry that one of the Mirror Lords will possess Iris and take her away from him  Barry races to stop the mirror from breaking  with Top at his side  However  when the White Lantern entity reaches out to Captain Boomerang  telling him to  Throw the Boomerang   Boomerang responds by throwing dozens of boomerangs in every direction  One of them hits the glass and it begins to break  Top tells Flash to stop the Mirror Lords  while he goes and protects Iris  Flash questions   This doesn t make any sense   but Top throws him into the mirror and flees  In the mirror  Flash is exposed to strange visions of his mother  Outside  the Rogue Mirror Master tells the others that the mirror is actually a slow acting poison and they flee  Barry escapes the mirror confused and asks   Where are the Mirror Lords   He is then arrested by the Renegades  who realize that this was all a setup by Top to frame the Flash for his own personal gains  Barry is transported to a 25th century court  while Top confronts Iris  The story concludes with Barry escaping the 25th century court and going after Top  Top reveals that the reason for all of his crimes is because Barry reopened a previously closed case  Barry felt that the person convicted was actually innocent  The person who is actually guilty of the crime is one of Top s ancestors  Top reveals that they do not allow anyone in the Renegades who has any ancestors with a criminal record  The Flash is able to beat Top  and convict the right man for murder  letting go the innocent man who was sent to prison  Afterward  the 25th century court and the Renegades go over the facts  realizing that the Flash was right and that their entire record of history is wrong  This alludes to the upcoming Flash event  Flashpoint  Meanwhile  a man on a Speed Force powered motorcycle  later revealed to be a Speed Force police officer under the name of Hot Pursuit  33  moves through the desert and says that if Barry does not find the flashpoint  it will destroy the world  As he continues through the desert  Speed Force lightning

relationship with longtime co worker Patty Spivot  however it is hinted that Iris has a romantic attraction to Barry  The Flash is currently in a new Flash volume  which in September 2011  The new ongoing book is drawn and written by Francis Manapul and Brian Buccellato  In this new series  the Flash draws deeper into the Speed Force  enhancing his mental abilities  Barry will also be used as part of the main cast of the relaunched Justice League series  making his debut in a story written by Geoff Johns and drawn by Jim Lee  40   edit  Powers and abilities Barry Allen is capable of running faster than the speed of light and  at times during the Silver Age  described as faster than the speed of thought  In Flash  150   straining every muscle   he ran at ten times the speed of light  41  However  when he pushed himself further  during the Crisis on Infinite Earths  he appeared to waste away as he was converted into pure energy  traveled back in time  and was revealed in Secret Origins Annual  2 to be the very bolt of lightning that gave him his powers  42  This was later retconned in The Flash  Rebirth  1  where Barry stated that he  ran into the Speed Force   and that   When  he  stopped the Anti Monitor  when  he  ran into the  Speed Force  and joined it  it was like shedding  his  identity   16  Barry Allen possesses abilities that Jay Garrick has not always been able to duplicate  most notably the ability to  vibrate  in such a way as to pass through solid matter  Allen has regularly engaged in time travel using the Cosmic Treadmill device  he no longer needs this to conduct this feat   and is able to  vibrate  between dimensions  Barry is unique among Flashes and most characters in the DC Universe in that he has complete control over every molecule in his body  43  In Grant Morrison s Final Crisis  using the Speed Force  Allen was able to undo the effects of the Anti Life Equation upon an individual  an ability he used on his wife Iris to free her from the bondage of Darkseid s mind control  14  He has recently been revealed to not only be connected to the Speed Force  but is the very source of it  generating it with every step he takes  As such  he presumably has some of the Speed Force related abilities other speedsters have demonstrated  such as lending and stealing speed   though he has yet to demonstrate such abilities  This alone is enough to make him one of the most powerful beings on Earth  and perhaps in existence  He is also immune to telepathic attacks and control  as he can shift his thoughts at a speed faster than normal thought  He used this tactic against Black Lantern Martian Manhunter in Blackest Night  Through  speed reading  Barry can absorb large amounts of information into his short term memory  which remain in his mind just long enough for him to make use of it  Using this technique  Barry was able to learn enough about building work to rebuild a destroyed apartment building  44  While it was initially believed that Barry Allen is unable to alter the timeline  as that power is tied to the Reverse Speedforce held by Professor Zoom  it has since revealed that Barry Allen does possess that power  only  due to him researching the most utilitarian effects of the Speed Force  he never did mastered it  Still  as showcased in Flashpoint  Barry Allen lacks the subtitetly and the knowledge over time travel mechanics needed to enact specific changes  thus leading him  on his first use of the aforementioned power  to turn his own timeline into a distopia instead of simply reverting a small change enacted by Zoom   45   edit  Rogues gallery Main article  Rogues  comics  The Flash has acquired a colorful rogues gallery of villains  Their number includes  but is not limited to  several who formed a loose association and refer to themselves as the Rogues  disdaining the use of the term  supervillain  or  super criminal   These criminals typically have unusually modest goals for their power level  robbery or other petty crimes   and each have adopted a specific theme in his or her equipment and methods   edit  Other versions Barry Allen is a supporting character in Frank Miller s The Dark Knight Strikes Again  He has been kept by Lex Luthor as a power source for most of the East Coast  constantly running on a treadmill to provide cheap electrical power or Iris will be executed  After being rescued  Barry wears a black version of his original Flash costume which Batman s young assistants deemed as  old     Kids  these days  can t tell the difference between just plain old and classic   he mutters  He then aids Batman and other heroes in restoring order  though they clash when Barry wants to save people in danger while Batman is prepared to let them die for the sake of his long term strategy  Barry Allen appears in JLA  Age of Wonder as a scientist working with Superman and a consortium of early twentieth century scientists such as Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla  His uniform incorporates the Silver Age look with the Mercury style helmet worn by Jay Garrick  Other Elseworld appearances include  League of Justice  a Lord of the Rings type story  where the character is recast as  Phaeton   who wears a mystical brooch resembling Flash s lightning bolt chest emblem  and has bathed in dragon s blood in order to protect himself from speed friction  and Batman  Holy Terror  where he is one of a number of metahumans imprisoned by a theocratic state  discovered and released by Batman during a raid on the government  only to be killed when his captor reveals that his research has included discovering how to deactivate the aura that protects Barry from being destroyed by the friction he generates while running  A version of Barry Allen aka Hot Pursuit appeared in the lead into Flashpoint  46  Little is known about the exact origins of Hot Pursuit  or how he came to be  The only thing known is the fact that he is a version of Barry Allen from the future  who goes back in time to warn himself about the upcoming events of Flashpoint  Hot Pursuit s history is assumed to be the same as Barry Allen s up until the single point in time  where a great anomaly altered the reality of the future all together  The unknown event that made Barry Allen don the role of Hot Pursuit is the same event he travels back in time to warn himself about  as well as the event that causes Flashpoint  With Flashpoint s wide spread time altering effects  it is possible that Barry Allen lost his connection to the Speed Force  thus needing the cosmic motorcycle Hot Pursuit is seen riding to access the Speed Force and travel back in time  This motorcycle also needs to be charged constantly with mass amounts of electricity in order for it to continue to be able to access the Speed Force  thus it is unable to naturally access the Speed Force like Barry Allen or the rest of the Flash Family  46   Buried Alien  A story in the Marvel comic book series Quasar  written four years after Crisis on Infinite Earths  has the Marvel Universe speedsters facing off in a competition set up by a being called the Runner  The contest is a race from the Earth to the Moon  During the race  a surge of energy hits the track  leaving a being with blonde hair and dressed in the remains of a red outfit with yellow boots  This being has no memory  but an enormous desire to run  He goes on to win the race  passing Marvel speedsters such as Quicksilver and Speed Demon in the process  When asked what his name is  the man replies   I don t know    Buried Alien  or something like that   When asked how it felt to be the fastest man alive  he replied   It feels    right   The racer goes on to take the name Fast Forward  disappearing into the universe in an attempt to help Makkari  who is stuck at hyper speed  In the Elseworlds tale Superman  amp  Batman  Generations  Barry s life is still the same  but heroes age in real time  This reality shows no sign of the Crisis ever happening  so an elderly Barry is seen to be alive and well in 2008  The Elseworlds story Flashpoint shows an alternate reality where Barry Allen becomes the Flash in 1956  the year he first appeared in comics  He is more involved in government affairs  By 1963  he has ended the Cold War and pushed the communists out of Vietnam  However  his career is cut short as he takes a bullet aimed at John F  Kennedy  He is paralyzed from the neck down  but he still has the fastest mind on Earth and forms Allen Industries  By 1988  he and Vandal Savage s Immortality  Inc  have begun an exploration of Mars  In 1998  Wally West leads an expedition to Mars  during which he finds the flashpoint  an object which killed all life on Mars  Savage reveals he is the one who shot Allen  Barry makes contact with Wally  who is going on a super speed rampage  Barry is cured and defeats Savage  He then enters the flashpoint  going into the Speed Force  In The Flash Annual  7  an alternate universe is shown where shortly after Wally West became Kid Flash  he became a superstar celebrity  However  Barry was tragically killed while battling Captain Cold  Ten years later  Wally is now a paraplegic and Captain Cold has written a supposedly  true  story about Barry that paints him as arrogant and incompetent  Wally decides to make a movie about his mentor that portrays the genuine Barry Allen  The resulting film is a success  Recently the Barry Allen of Earth 51  where secret identities are no longer needed by superheroes  is seen alive  He is subsequently killed by the Monitor of New Earth  In JLA  The Nail a version of Barry Allen is a member of a Justice League where Superman did not become a hero and join the team until much later  In lieu of Superboy s adventures with the Legion of Super Heroes  the Flash visited the 30th Century instead  Barry Allen of The Nail is almost identical to the pre Crisis Earth 1 version  except that his costume resembles Wally s  His most prominent scene in the story is a confrontation with Amazo where he manages to defeat the android by turning intangible and removing his computerized brain before Amazo can process and mimic that attack  In JLA Avengers Barry Allen appears in issue 3 as the Flash in the JLA when the two realities start changing  along with Hal Jordan  When the two teams see their real futures  Barry witnesses his death during Crisis on Infinite Earths as the Grandmaster shows the heroes how reality should be  but nevertheless resolves to help restore the timeline as it is not his place to play God  He talk with Hal Jordan over the similarity of their situation  He helps the team get into Krona s base by using his running on a treadmill to pass the ship through the dimensional barrier  With the Wasp  he is ordered by Captain America to find ways through Krona s defences  and alerts the group to a probably lethal force field  During the final battle  Barry saves Hawkeye from being killed when the Absorbing Man breaks the ground beneath him  but both of them are blasted and apparently killed by Dreamslayer  At the end  it is revealed that Barry got the two of them out alive and at Captain America s suggestion they laid low and because of this  Hawkeye is able to destroy Krona s machine with a TNT arrow while Barry distracts him  then Barry takes the 12 items of power  As a result  reality is restored  Barry disappears and Wally returns   edit  In other media Flash in other media   edit  Animation He had some adventures in the rotating series of superheroes cartoons included in The Superman Aquaman Hour of Adventure  with Kid Flash  He also was a founding member of the Justice League of America along with Superman  Green Lantern  Hawkman  and the Atom  He also appeared in Super Friends to help fellow Justice Leaguer Superman  JLA members Flash  Green Lantern  and Batman eventually joined forces with Superman and the rest of the Super Friends in Super Friends  The All New Super Friends Hour  Challenge of the Super Friends  Super Friends  and The Super Powers Team  Galactic Guardians where he was an important member of the superteam  Barry Allen never officially appears in the DCAU series of animated projects by Bruce Timm and Paul Dini  However  a police detective in the Justice League episode  The Brave and the Bold  has a passing resemblance to Barry Allen  acting as the  good cop  during the Flash s interrogation  47  In the Justice League Unlimited episode  Flash and Substance   the Wally West Flash mentions his uncle  flying in  to attend the dedication of a Flash Museum  There is also another character in the same episode who is Wally s teacher at the forensic lab and bears a resemblance to Barry  Although the series  Flash is Wally West in name and likeness  he has many of Barry Allen s story elements  such as his origin  job  city  foes  and status as being the first scarlet speedster and co founding the Justice League  In part 1 of the episode  The Brave and the Bold  when the Flash goes into a comatose state he has some strange dreams  in one he has gained so much weight that he is too fat to run  a homage to the Silver Age issue of The Flash  115  and in another he has a giant head  a nod to another Silver Age comic  The Flash  177  He made a cameo appearance in  The Joining  Part Two   the season 4 finale of The Batman  He also appeared in the season 5 episode  A Mirror Darkly   portrayed by voice actor Charlie Schlatter  who reprised his role as the Flash from Superman  The

returns to his original time period  Barry Allen appears in the Young Justice animated series as a member of the JLA and Kid Flash s mentor  49  He is voiced by George Eads  50  He is shown wearing Wally s costume rather than his original Silver Age outfit  51  Issue  5 of the show s tie in comic book reveals that rather than gaining his powers from a freak accident  Barry deliberately recreated the lab explosion that gave Jay Garrick his speed abilities back in the 1940s  52   edit  Live action Actor Rod Haase appeared as Barry Allen s Flash in 1979 s two part special  Legends of the Superheroes  53  Barry Allen was the Flash in the 1990s Flash live action TV series  although this character incorporated elements of Wally s social life  as well as previously non existent characters such as a brother and nephew  He was played by John Wesley Shipp  This version of the Flash reaches maximum speed upon breaking the sound barrier  at which point he has to stop to rest  CBS originally wanted to cast Jack Coleman  who declined the role to pursue a career in Broadway  54  The unsuccessful 1997 Justice League of America pilot featured actor Kenny Johnston as a 20 something  unemployed  Barry Allen  The fifth episode of season 4 of Smallville  entitled  Run   featured speedster Bart Allen  Impulse   He is portrayed as a self centered teenager who uses his powers for personal gain   including the Flash logo on his rucksack  although by the end of the episode  he was showing signs of changing his ways  Bart also carries around identification of Jay Garrick  Barry Allen  and Wally West  three Flashes in the main DC Universe  In season 6  episode 11   Justice   he is working with Green Arrow  Cyborg  and Aquaman to bring down Lex Luthor s plans of experimenting on  meteor freaks

version of The Flash   edit  Video games Barry Allen is the Flash in the crossover video game Mortal Kombat vs  DC Universe voiced by Taliesin Jaffe  He appears in a variant of his current costume  Although the character model contains green eyes  normally a sign of Wally West  as well as the dual lightning bolt belt  instead of Allen s single bolt belt   which is associated with West s  the game s  Bios  section confirms that it is indeed Allen  55  In Flash s ending  Flash discovered that he had retained a psychic bond with the warrior Liu Kang as a result of his aura attunement  The two agreed to warn each other of any cross universal breaches  It was not long before Liu Kang appeared and warned the Flash about the impending attack by the sorcerer Quan Chi  Barry Allen appears as

 Music  Ballad of Barry Allen    A song by the band Jim s Big Ego on their album  They re Everywhere  The song portrays Barry as a tragic character  whose perception of the world is so accelerated that all of reality appears to proceed at a snail s pace  causing him to gradually slip into depression  The band s frontman  Jim Infantino  is the nephew of Flash co creator Carmine Infantino  who provided the cover art for the same album   edit  Mentions and references in media In the 2008 pilot episode of The Middleman  Wendy Watson  Natalie Morales  mentions The Flash as one of her favorite

Catch Me If You Can  Frank Abagnale  Jr   Leonardo DiCaprio  uses the name Barry Allen from the Flash comic book as one of his aliases in the film  The fact that he uses the name of a comic book

suit  In the TV series The Big Bang Theory  Sheldon Cooper dressed up as Flash in two of the episodes   edit  Reception IGN ranked this version of the Flash as the 49th greatest hero of all time
