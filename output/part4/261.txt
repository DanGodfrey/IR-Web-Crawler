E book From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Amazon Kindle 3  a sample e book reader  An electronic book  variously  e book  ebook  digital book  is a book length publication in digital form  consisting of text  images  or both  and produced on  published through  and readable on computers or other electronic devices  1  Sometimes the equivalent of a conventional printed book  e books can also be born digital  The Oxford Dictionary of English defines the e book as  an electronic version of a printed book   2  but e books can and do exist without any printed equivalent  E books are usually read on dedicated e book readers  Personal computers and some mobile phones can also be used to read e books  Contents 1 History 1 1 E book formats 1 2

according to whom   the Index Thomisticus  a heavily annotated electronic index to the works of Thomas Aquinas  prepared by Roberto Busa beginning in the late 1940s  However  this is sometimes omitted  perhaps because the digitized text was  at least initially  a means to developing an index and concordance  rather than as a published edition in its own rights  Alternatively  electronic books are considered by some to have started in the mid 1960s  with the NLS project headed by Doug Engelbart at Stanford Research Institute  SRI   and the Hypertext Editing System and FRESS projects headed by Andries van Dam at Brown University  3  4  5  The former ran on specialized hardware  while the latter ran on IBM mainframes  FRESS documents were structure oriented rather than line oriented  and were formatted dynamically for different users  display hardware  window sizes  and so on  as well as having automated tables of contents  indexes  and so on  All these systems also provided extensive hyperlinking  graphics  and other capabilities  Van Dam coined the term  electronic book   citation needed  FRESS was used for primary text reading  annotation  and online discussions in several courses  including English Poetry and Biochemistry  Brown faculty made extensive use of FRESS  for example the philosopher Roderick Chisholm used it to produce several of his books  For example  in the Preface to Person and Object he writes  The book would not have been completed without the epoch making File Retrieval and Editing System     6  Brown s leadership in electronic book systems continued for many years  including navy funded projects for electronic repair manuals 7   a large scale distributed hypermedia system known as InterMedia 8   a spinoff company Electronic Book Technologies that built DynaText  the first SGML based book reader system  and the Scholarly Technology Group s extensive work on the still prevalent Open eBook standard  Yet others believe that the inventor of the e book is Michael S  Hart  9  10  11  In 1971  Hart was given extensive computer time by the operators of the Xerox Sigma V mainframe at the University of Illinois  Seeking a worthy use of this resource  he created his first ebook by typing the United States Declaration of Independence into a computer  Project Gutenberg was launched afterwards to create electronic copies of more books  12  One early e book implementation was the desktop prototype for a proposed notebook computer  the Dynabook  in the 1970s at PARC  a general purpose portable personal computer capable of displaying books for reading  13  In 1992  Sony launched the Data Discman  an electronic book reader that could read e books that were stored on CDs  One of the electronic publications that could be played on the Data Discman was called The Library of the Future  14  Early e books were generally written for specialty areas and a limited audience  meant to be read only by small and devoted interest groups  The scope of the subject matter of these e books included technical manuals for hardware  manufacturing techniques and other subjects  citation needed  In the 1990s  the general availability of the Internet made transferring electronic files much easier  including e books   edit  E book formats See also  comparison of e book formats Numerous e book formats emerged and proliferated  some supported by major software companies such as Adobe with its PDF format  and others supported by independent and open source programmers  Multiple readers followed multiple formats  most of them specializing in only one format  and thereby fragmenting the e book market even more  Due to exclusiveness and limited readerships of e books  the fractured market of independent publishers and specialty authors lacked consensus regarding a standard for packaging and selling e books  However  in the late 1990s a consortium was formed to develop the Open eBook format as a way for authors and publishers to provide a single source document that could be handled by many book reading software and hardware platforms  Open eBook defined required subsets of XHTML and CSS  a set of multimedia formats  others could be used  but there must also be a fallback in one of the required formats   and an XML schema for a  manifest   to list the components of a given ebook  identify a table of contents  cover art  and so on  Google Books has converted many public domain works to this open format  In 2010 e books continued to gain in their own underground markets  Many e book publishers began distributing books that were in the public domain  At the same time  authors with books that were not accepted by publishers offered their works online so they could be seen by others  Unofficial  and occasionally unauthorized  catalogs of books became available over the web  and sites devoted to e books began disseminating information about e books to the public  15   edit  Libraries U S  Libraries began providing free e books to the public in 1998 through their web sites and associated services  16  although the e books were primarily scholarly  technical or professional in nature  and could not be downloaded  In 2003  libraries began offering free downloadable popular fiction and non fiction e books to the public  launching an e book lending model that worked much more successfully for public libraries  17  The number of library e book distributors and lending models continued to increase over the next few years  In 2010  a Public Library Funding and Technology Access Study 18  found that 66  of public libraries in the U S  were offering e books  19  and a large movement in the library industry began seriously examining the issues related to lending e books  acknowledging a tipping point of broad e book usage  20  However  some publishers and authors have not endorsed the concept of electronic publishing  citing issues with demand  piracy and proprietary devices  21  Demand driven acquisition  DDA  has been around for a few years in public libraries  which allows vendors to streamline the acquisition process by offering to match a library s selection profile to the vendor s e book titles  22  The library s catalog is then populated with records for all the e books that match the profile  22  The decision to purchase the title is left to the patrons  although the library can set purchasing conditions such as a maximum price and purchasing caps so that the dedicated funds are spent according to the library s budget  22   edit  Dedicated hardware readers There have been several generations of dedicated hardware e book readers  The Rocket eBook 23  and several others were introduced around 1998  but did not gain widespread acceptance  As of 2009 update   new marketing models for e books were being developed and a new generation of reading hardware was produced  E books  as opposed to ebook readers  have yet to achieve global distribution  In the United States  as of September 2009  the Amazon Kindle model and Sony s PRS 500 were the dominant e reading devices  24  By March 2010  some reported that the Barnes  amp  Noble Nook may be selling more units than the Kindle  25   On January 27  2010 Apple Inc  launched a multi function device called the iPad 26  and announced agreements with five of the six largest publishers citation needed  that would allow Apple to distribute e books  27  The iPad includes a built in app for e books called iBooks and the iBooks Store  In July 2010  online bookseller Amazon com reported sales of ebooks for its proprietary Kindle outnumbered sales of hardcover books for the first time ever during the second quarter of 2010  saying it sold 140 e books for every 100 hardcover books  including hardcovers for which there was no digital edition  28  By January 2011  ebook sales at Amazon had surpassed its paperback sales  29  In the overall U S  market  paperback book sales are still much larger than either hardcover or e book  the American Publishing Association estimated e books represented 8 5  of sales as of mid 2010  up from 3  a year before  30  In Canada  The Sentimentalists won the prestigious national Giller Prize  Owing to the small scale of the novel s independent publisher  the book was initially not widely available in printed form  but the ebook edition became the top selling title for Kobo devices in 2010  31  A comparison of available e book readers can be found at comparison of e book readers   edit  Timeline This section

needs additional citations for verification  Tagged since October 2009  It may contain original research  Tagged since October 2009   edit  Advantages Over 2 million free books are available for download as of August 2009  52  Mobile availability of e books may be provided for users with a mobile data connection  so that these e books need not be stored on the device  An e book can be offered indefinitely  without ever going  out of print   In the space that a comparably sized print book takes up  an e reader can potentially contain thousands of e books  limited only by its memory capacity  If space is at a premium  such as in a backpack or at home  it can be an advantage that an e book collection takes up little room and weight  E book websites can include the ability to translate books into many different languages  making the works available to speakers of languages not covered by printed translations  Depending on the device  an e book may be readable in low light or even total darkness  Many newer readers have the ability to display motion  enlarge or change fonts  53  use Text to speech software to read the text aloud for visually impaired  partially sighted  elderly  dyslectic or just lazy people  search for key terms  find definitions  or allow highlighting bookmarking and annotation  Devices that utilize E Ink can imitate the look and ease of readability of a printed work while consuming very little power  allowing continuous reading for weeks at time  While an e book reader costs much more than one book  the electronic texts are at times cheaper  Moreover  a great share of e books are available online for free  minus the minimal costs of the electronics required  For example  all fiction from before the year 1900 is in the public domain  Also  libraries lend more current e book titles for limited times  free samples are available of many publications  and there are other lending models being piloted as well  E books can be printed for less than the price of traditional new books using new on demand book printers  An e book can be purchased borrowed  downloaded  and used immediately  whereas when one buys or borrows a book  one must go to a bookshop  a home library  or public library during limited hours  or wait for a delivery  The production of e books does not consume paper and ink  The necessary computer or e reader uses less materials  54  Printed books use 3 times more raw materials and 78 times more water to produce  55  Depending on possible digital rights management  e books can be backed up to recover them in the case of loss or damage and it may be possible to recover a new copy without cost from the distributor  Compared to printed publishing  it is cheaper and easier for authors to self publish e books  Also  the dispersal of a free e book copy can stimulate the sales of the printed version  56   edit  Drawbacks Ebook formats and file types continue to develop and change through time through advances and developments in technology or the introduction of new proprietary formats  While printed books remain readable for many years  e books may need to be copied or converted to a new carrier or file type over time  Because of proprietary formats or lack of file support  formatted e books may be unusable on certain readers  PDF and epub are growing standards  but are not universal  Paper books can be bought and wrapped for a present and a library of books can provide visual appeal  while the digital nature of e books makes them non visible and intangible  E books cannot provide the physical feel of the cover  paper  and binding of the original printed work  An author who publishes a book often puts more into the work than simply the words on the pages  E books may cause people  to do the grazing and quick reading that screens enable  rather than be by themselves with the author s ideas   57  They may use the e books simply for reference purposes rather than reading for pleasure and leisure  58  Books with large pictures  such as children s books  or diagrams are more inconvenient for viewing and reading  A book will never turn off  can last for several decades or longer and would be unusable only if significantly damaged  The shelf life of a printed book exceeds that of an e book reader  as over time the reader s battery will drain and require recharging  Due to faults in hardware or software  e book readers may malfunction and data loss can occur  As with any piece of technology  the reader must be protected from the elements  such as extreme cold  heat  water  etc    while print books are not susceptible to damage from electromagnetic pulses  surges  impacts  or temperatures typically found in automobiles on a hot day  The cost of an e book reader far exceeds that of a single book  and e books often cost the same as their print versions  Due to the high cost of the initial investment in some form of e reader  e books are cost prohibitive to much of the world s population  Furthermore  there is no used e book market  so consumers will neither be able to recoup some of their costs by selling an unwanted title they have finished  nor will they be able to buy used copies at significant discounts  as they can now easily do with printed books  Because of the high tech appeal of the e reader  they are a greater target for theft than an individual print book  Along with the theft of the physical device  any e books it contains also become stolen  E books purchased from vendors like Amazon or Barnes  amp  Noble com are stored  in the cloud  on servers and  digital lockers  and have the benefit of being easily retrieved if an e reading device is lost  Not all e booksellers are cloud based  if an e book is stolen  accidentally lost  or deleted  in the absence of a backup it may have to be repurchased  The display resolutions of reading devices are currently lower than those of printed materials and may cause discomfort due to glare on the screen or difficulty holding the device  Due to digital rights management  customers typically cannot resell or loan their e books to other readers  59  However  some Barnes  amp  Noble e books are lendable for two weeks via their  LendMe  technology  60  Additionally  the potential for piracy of e books may make publishers and authors reluctant to distribute digitally  61  E book readers require various toxic substances to produce  are non biodegradable  and the disposal of their batteries in particular raises environmental concerns  As technologies rapidly change and old devices become obsolete  there will be larger amounts of toxic wastes that are not easily biodegradable like paper   Reading devices for e books in a reflowable format such as EPUB may display page numbers  but these numbers change from device to device depending on factors such as the size of the display and the selected font size  This makes them unsuitable for citation purposes  To remedy this problem  Amazon Kindle e books contain what are called  location numbers   that is  numbers in the margin of the electronic text that indicate where the corresponding page begins in the printed version of the book  62  However  if there is no standard hard copy in print  which may increasingly be the case as the popularity of digital publishing grows  these  location numbers  will not exist  APA  MLA and the Chicago Manual of Style have all tried to address the problem of accurate academic citation by recommending that versions be identified  e g   Kindle edition  Kindle DX version  or any other  source of e book   63  The wide variety of versions  text and font sizes make this solution impractical  The only real solution would be a standard format for all devices  No Kobo Refunds  Paper books can usually be returned or exchanged  within a prescribed time period   however Kobo e Books cannot be returned   64  Amazon Kindle eBooks do allow refunds within 7 days   65  The USA s Federal Aviation Administration requires the prohibition of e book reader use on commercial airliners during takeoff and landing  66   edit  Digital rights management See also  Digital rights management E books Anti circumvention techniques may be used to restrict what the user may do with an e book  For instance  it may not be possible to transfer ownership of an e book to another person  though such a transaction is common with physical books  Some devices can phone home to track readers and reading habits  restrict printing  or arbitrarily modify reading material  This includes restricting the copying and distribution of works in the public domain through the use of  click wrap  licensing  effectively limiting the rights of the public to distribute  sell or use texts in the public domain freely  Most e book publishers do not warn their customers about the possible implications of the digital rights management tied to their products  Generally they claim that digital rights management is meant to prevent copying of the e book  However in many cases it is also possible that digital rights management will result in the complete denial of access by the purchaser to the e book  67  With some formats of DRM  the e book is tied to a specific computer or device  In these cases the DRM will usually let the purchaser move the book a limited number of times after which they cannot use it on any additional devices  If the purchaser upgrades or replaces their devices eventually they may lose access to their purchase  Some forms of digital rights management depend on the existence of online services to authenticate the purchasers  When the company that provides the service goes out of business or decides to stop providing the service  the purchaser will no longer be able to access the e book  As with digital rights management in other media  e books are more like rental or leasing than purchase  The restricted book comes with a number of restrictions  and eventually access to the purchase can be removed by a number of different parties involved  These include the publisher of the book  the provider of the DRM scheme  and the publisher of the reader software  These are all things that are significantly different from the realm of experiences anyone has had with a physical copy of the book   edit  Production Some e books are produced simultaneously with the production of a printed format  as described in electronic publishing  though in many instances they may not be put on sale until later  Often  e books are produced from pre existing hard copy books  generally by document scanning  sometimes with the use of robotic book scanners  having the technology to quickly scan books without damaging the original print edition  Scanning a book produces a set of image files  which may additionally be converted into text format by an OCR program  68  Occasionally  as in some e text projects  a book may be produced by re entering the text from a keyboard  As a newer development  sometimes only the electronic version of a book is produced by the publisher  It is even possible to release an e book chapter by chapter as each chapter is written  This is useful in fields such as information technology where topics can change quickly in the months that it takes to write a typical book  See  Realtime Publishers   It is also possible to convert an electronic book to a printed book by print on demand  However these are exceptions as tradition dictates that a book be launched in the print format and later if the author wishes an electronic version is produced  As of 2010  there is no industry wide e book bestseller list  but various e book vendors compile bestseller lists  such as those by Amazon Kindle Bestsellers 69  and Fictionwise  70  Two yearly awards for excellence in e books are the EPIC eBook Award 71   formerly EPPIE  given by EPIC  and the Dream Realm Award 72  for science fiction  fantasy and horror e books  Both awards have been given since 2000   edit  e Readers Main article  e book reader e book reader  also called an e book device or e reader  is a mobile electronic device that is designed primarily for the purpose of reading digital
