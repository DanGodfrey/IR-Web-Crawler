Corporation From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search This article is about business corporations  For other uses  see Corporation  disambiguation    Corporate  redirects here  For the Bollywood film  see Corporate  film   A corporation is created under the laws of a state as a separate legal entity that has privileges and liabilities that are distinct from those of its members  1  There are many different forms of corporations  most of which are used to conduct business  Early corporations were established by charter  i e  by an ad hoc act passed by a parliament or legislature   Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration  An important  but not universal  contemporary feature of a corporation is limited liability  If a corporation fails  shareholders may lose their investments  and employees may lose their jobs  but neither will be liable for debts to the corporation s creditors  Despite not being natural persons  corporations are recognized by the law to have rights and responsibilities like natural persons   people    Corporations can exercise human rights against real individuals and the state  2  and they can themselves be responsible for human rights violations  3  Corporations are conceptually immortal but they can  die  when they are  dissolved  either by statutory operation  order of court  or voluntary action on the part of shareholders  Insolvency may result in a form of corporate  death   when creditors force the liquidation and dissolution of the corporation under court order  4  but it most often results in a restructuring of corporate holdings  Corporations can even be convicted of criminal offenses  such as fraud and manslaughter  However corporations are not living entities in the way that humans are  5  Although corporate law varies in different jurisdictions  there are four characteristics of the business corporation  6  Legal personality Limited liability Transferable

Kopparberg mine  dated June 16  1288  The word  corporation  derives from corpus  the Latin word for body  or a  body of people   Entities which carried on business and were the subjects of legal rights were found in ancient Rome  and the Maurya Empire in ancient India  7  In medieval Europe  churches became incorporated  as did local governments  such as the Pope and the City of London Corporation  The point was that the incorporation would survive longer than the lives of any particular member  existing in perpetuity  The alleged oldest commercial corporation in the world  the Stora Kopparberg mining community in Falun  Sweden  obtained a charter from King Magnus Eriksson in 1347  Many European nations chartered corporations to lead colonial ventures  such as the Dutch East India Company or the Hudson s Bay Company  and these corporations came to play a large part in the history of corporate colonialism  Corporate mapping During the time of colonial expansion in the 17th century  the true progenitors of the modern corporation emerged as the  chartered company   Acting under a charter sanctioned by the Dutch government  the Dutch East India Company  VOC  defeated Portuguese forces and established itself in the Moluccan Islands in order to profit from the European demand for spices  Investors in the VOC were issued paper certificates as proof of share ownership  and were able to trade their shares on the original Amsterdam stock exchange  Shareholders are also explicitly granted limited liability in the company s royal charter  8  In the late 18th century  Stewart Kyd  the author of the first treatise on corporate law in English  defined a corporation as  a collection of many individuals united into one body  under a special denomination  having perpetual succession under an artificial form  and vested  by policy of the law  with the capacity of acting  in several respects  as an individual  particularly of taking and granting property  of contracting obligations  and of suing and being sued  of enjoying privileges and immunities in common  and of exercising a variety of political rights  more or less extensive  according to the design of its institution  or the powers conferred upon it  either at the time of its creation  or at any subsequent period of its existence    9   edit  Mercantilism See also  Mercantilism and South Sea Bubble A bond issued by the Dutch East India Company  dating from 1623  for the amount of 2 400 florins Labeled by both contemporaries and historians as  the grandest society of merchants in the universe   the British East India Company would come to symbolize the dazzlingly rich potential of the corporation  as well as new methods of business that could be both brutal and exploitative  10  On 31 December 1600  the English monarchy granted the company a 15 year monopoly on trade to and from the East Indies and Africa  By 1611  shareholders in the East India Company were earning an almost 150  return on their investment  Subsequent stock offerings demonstrated just how lucrative the Company had become  Its first stock offering in 1613 1616 raised  418 000  and its first offering in 1617 1622 raised  1 6 million  11  In the United States  government chartering began to fall out of vogue in the mid 19th century  Corporate law at the time was focused on protection of the public interest  and not on the interests of corporate shareholders  Corporate charters were closely regulated by the states  Forming a corporation usually required an act of legislature  Investors generally had to be given an equal say in corporate governance  and corporations were required to comply with the purposes expressed in their charters  Many private firms in the 19th century avoided the corporate model for these reasons  Andrew Carnegie formed his steel operation as a limited partnership  and John D  Rockefeller set up Standard Oil as a trust   Eventually  state governments began to realize the greater corporate registration revenues available by providing more permissive corporate laws  New Jersey was the first state to adopt an  enabling  corporate law  with the goal of attracting more business to the state  12 Delaware followed  and soon became known as the most corporation friendly state in the country after New Jersey raised taxes on the corporations  driving them out  New Jersey reduced these taxes after this mistake was realized  but by then it was too late  even today  most major public corporations in the United States are set up under Delaware law  By the beginning of the 19th century  government policy on both sides of the Atlantic began to change  reflecting the growing popularity of the proposition that corporations were riding the economic wave of the future  In 1819  the U  S  Supreme Court granted corporations a plethora of rights they had not previously recognized or enjoyed  13  Corporate charters were deemed  inviolable   and not subject to arbitrary amendment or abolition by state governments  14  The Corporation as a whole was labeled an  artificial person    possessing both individuality and immortality  15  At around the same time  British legislation was similarly freeing the corporation from historical restrictions  In 1844 the British Parliament passed the Joint Stock Companies Act  which allowed companies to incorporate without a royal charter or an Act of Parliament  16  Ten years later  limited liability  the key provision of modern corporate law  passed into English law  in response to increasing pressure from newly emerging capital interests  Parliament passed the Limited Liability Act 1855  which established the principle that any corporation could enjoy limited legal liability on both contract and tort claims simply by registering as a  limited  company with the appropriate government agency  17  This prompted the English periodical The Economist to write in 1855 that  never  perhaps  was a change so vehemently and generally demanded  of which the importance was so much overrated    18  The glaring inaccuracy of the second part of this judgment was recognized by the same magazine more than 70 years later  when it claimed that    t he economic historian of the future      may be inclined to assign to the nameless inventor of the principle of limited liability  as applied to trading corporations  a place of honour with Watt and Stephenson  and other pioneers of the Industrial Revolution    19   edit  Modern corporations By the end of the 19th century the Sherman Act  New Jersey allowing holding companies  and mergers resulted in larger corporations with dispersed shareholders   See The Modern Corporation and Private Property  20  The well known Santa Clara County v  Southern Pacific Railroad decision began to influence policymaking and the modern corporate era had begun  The 20th century saw a proliferation of enabling law across the world  which helped to drive economic booms in many countries before and after World War I  Starting in the 1980s  many countries with large state owned corporations moved toward privatization  the selling of publicly owned services and enterprises to corporations  Deregulation  reducing the regulation of corporate activity  often accompanied privatization as part of a laissez faire policy  Another major postwar shift was toward the development of conglomerates  in which large corporations purchased smaller corporations to expand their industrial base  Japanese firms developed a horizontal conglomeration model  the keiretsu  which was later duplicated in other countries as well  21   edit  Corporate law Main article  Corporate law Companies law Company Business Business entities Sole proprietorship Partnership  General

doctrine Limited liability Piercing the corporate veil Rochdale Principles Ultra vires Related areas Civil procedure Contract v t e The existence of a corporation requires a special legal framework and body of law that specifically grants the corporation legal personality  and typically views a corporation as a fictional person  a legal person  or a moral person  as opposed to a natural person   Corporate statutes typically empower corporations to own property  sign binding contracts  and pay taxes in a capacity separate from that of its shareholders  who are sometimes referred to as  members    According to Lord Chancellor Haldane     a corporation is an abstraction  It has no mind of its own any more than it has a body of its own  its active and directing will must consequently be sought in the person of somebody who is really the directing mind and will of the corporation  the very ego and centre of the personality of the corporation    22  The legal personality has two economic implications  First it grants creditors  as opposed to shareholders or employees  priority over the corporate assets upon liquidation  Second  corporate assets cannot be withdrawn by its shareholders  nor can the assets of the firm be taken by personal creditors of its shareholders  The second feature requires special legislation and a special legal framework  as it cannot be reproduced via standard contract law  23  The regulations most favorable to incorporation include  Regulation Description Limited liability Unlike a partnership or sole proprietorship  shareholders of a modern business corporation have  limited  liability for the corporation s debts and obligations  24  As a result  their losses cannot exceed the amount which they contributed to the corporation as dues or payment for shares  This enables corporations to  socialize their costs  for the primary benefit of shareholders  to socialize a cost is to spread it to society in general  25  The economic rationale for this is that it allows anonymous trading in the shares of the corporation  by eliminating the corporation s creditors as a stakeholder in such a transaction  Without limited liability  a creditor would probably not allow any share to be sold to a buyer at least as creditworthy as the seller  Limited liability further allows corporations to raise large amounts of finance for their enterprises by combining funds from many owners of stock  Limited liability reduces the amount that a shareholder can lose in a company  This increases the attraction to potential shareholders  and thus increases both the number of willing shareholders and the amount they are likely to invest  However  some jurisdictions also permit another type of corporation  in which shareholders  liability is unlimited  for example the unlimited liability corporation in two provinces of Canada  and the unlimited company in the United Kingdom  Perpetual lifetime Another advantage is that the assets and structure of the corporation may continue beyond the lifetimes of its shareholders and bondholders  This allows stability and the accumulation of capital  which is thus available for investment in larger and longer lasting projects than if the corporate assets were subject to dissolution and distribution  This was also important in medieval times  when land donated to the Church  a corporation  would not generate the feudal fees that a lord could claim upon a landholder s death  In this regard  see Statute of Mortmain   However a corporation can be dissolved by a government authority  putting an end to its existence as a legal entity  But this usually only happens if the company breaks the law  for example  fails to meet annual filing requirements  or in certain circumstances if the company requests dissolution    edit  Ownership and control Persons and other legal entities composed of persons  such as trusts and other corporations  can have the right to vote or receive dividends once declared by the board of directors  In the case of for profit corporations  these voters hold shares of stock and are thus called shareholders or stockholders  When no stockholders exist  a corporation may exist as a non stock corporation  in the United Kingdom  a  company limited by guarantee   and instead of having stockholders  the corporation has members who have the right to vote on its operations  Voting members are not the only members of a  Corporation   The members of a non stock corporation are identified in the Articles of Incorporation  UK equivalent  Articles of Association  and the titles of the member classes may include  Trustee    Active    Associate   and or  Honorary   However  each of these listed in the Articles of Incorporation are members of the Corporation  The Articles of Incorporation may define the  Corporation  by another name  such as  The ABC Club  Inc   and  in which case  the  Corporation  and  The ABC Club  Inc   or just  The Club  are considered synonymous and interchangeable as they may appear elsewhere in the Articles of Incorporation or the By Laws  If the non stock corporation is not operated for profit  it is called a not for profit corporation  In either category  the corporation comprises a collective of individuals with a distinct legal status and with special privileges not provided to ordinary unincorporated businesses  to voluntary associations  or to groups of individuals  There are two broad classes of corporate governance forms in the world  In most of the world  control of the corporation is determined by a board of directors which is elected by the shareholders  In some jurisdictions  such as Germany  the control of the corporation is divided into two tiers with a supervisory board which elects a managing board  Germany is also unique in having a system known as co determination in which half of the supervisory board consists of representatives of the employees  The CEO  president  treasurer  and other titled officers are usually chosen by the board to manage the affairs of the corporation  In addition to the limited influence of shareholders  corporations can be controlled  in part  by creditors such as banks  In return for lending money to the corporation  creditors can demand a controlling interest analogous to that of a member  including one or more seats on the board of directors  In some jurisdictions  such as Germany and Japan  it is standard for banks to own shares in corporations whereas in other jurisdictions such as the United States  under the Glass Steagall Act of 1933  and the United Kingdom  under the Bank of England  banks are prohibited from owning shares in external corporations  However  since 1999 in the U  S   commercial banks have been allowed to enter into investment banking through separate subsidiaries thanks to the Financial Services Modernization Act or Gramm Leach Bliley Act  Since 1997  banks in the U  K  are supervised by the Financial Services Authority  its rules are non restrictive allowing both foreign and domestic capital to operate all financial institutions  including insurance  commercial and financial banking  26  Upon the Board s decision to dissolve a for profit corporation  shareholders receive the leftovers  following creditors and others with interests in the corporation  However shareholders receive the benefit of limited liability  so they are liable only for the amount they contributed   edit  Formation Historically  corporations were created by a charter granted by government  Today  corporations are usually registered with the state  province  or national government and regulated by the laws enacted by that government  Registration is the main prerequisite to the corporation s assumption of limited liability  The law sometimes requires the corporation to designate its principal address  as well as a registered agent  a person or company designated to receive legal service of process   It may also be required to designate an agent or other legal representative of the corporation  Generally  a corporation files articles of incorporation with the government  laying out the general nature of the corporation  the amount of stock it is authorized to issue  and the names and addresses of directors  Once the articles are approved  the corporation s directors meet to create bylaws that govern the internal functions of the corporation  such as meeting procedures and officer positions  The law of the jurisdiction in which a corporation operates will regulate most of its internal activities  as well as its finances  If a corporation operates outside its home state  it is often required to register with other governments as a foreign corporation  and is almost always subject to laws of its host state pertaining to employment  crimes  contracts  civil actions  and the like   edit  Naming Corporations generally have a distinct name  Historically  some corporations were named after their membership  for instance   The President and Fellows of Harvard College   Nowadays  corporations in most jurisdictions have a distinct name that does not need to make reference to their membership  In Canada  this possibility is taken to its logical extreme  many smaller Canadian corporations have no names at all  merely numbers based on a registration number  for example   12345678 Ontario Limited    which is assigned by the provincial or territorial government where the corporation incorporates  In most countries  corporate names include a term or an abbreviation that denotes the corporate status of the entity  for example   Incorporated  or  Inc   in the United States  or the limited liability of its members  for example   Limited  or  Ltd     These terms vary by jurisdiction and language  In some jurisdictions they are mandatory  and in others they are not  27  Their use puts everybody on constructive notice that they are dealing with an entity whose liability is limited  and does not reach back to the persons who own the entity  one can only collect from whatever assets the entity still controls when one obtains a judgment against it  Some jurisdictions do not allow the use of the word  company  alone to denote corporate status  since the word  company  may refer to a partnership or some other form of collective ownership  in the United States it can be used by a sole proprietorship but this is not generally the case elsewhere    edit  Financial disclosure In many jurisdictions  corporations whose shareholders benefit from limited liability are required to publish annual financial statements and other data  so that creditors who do business with the corporation are able to assess the creditworthiness of the corporation and cannot enforce claims against shareholders  28  Shareholders therefore sacrifice some loss of privacy in return for limited liability  This requirement generally applies in Europe  but not in Anglo American jurisdictions  except for publicly traded corporations  where financial disclosure is required for investor protection   edit  Unresolved issues The nature of the corporation continues to evolve in response to new situations as existing corporations promote new ideas and structures  the courts respond  and governments issue new regulations  A question of long standing is that of diffused responsibility  For example  if a corporation is found liable for a death  how should culpability and punishment for it be allocated among shareholders  directors  management and staff  and the corporation itself  See corporate liability  and specifically  corporate manslaughter  The law differs among jurisdictions  and is in a state of flux  Some argue that shareholders should be ultimately responsible in such circumstances  forcing them to consider issues other than profit when investing  but a corporation may have millions of small shareholders who know nothing about its business activities  Moreover  traders   especially hedge funds   may turn over shares in corporations many times a day  29  The issue of corporate repeat offenders  see H  Glasbeek   Wealth by Stealth  Corporate Crime  Corporate Law  and the Perversion of Democracy   ISBN 978 1896357416  Between the Lines Press  Toronto 2002  raises the question of the so called  death penalty for corporations   30   edit  Types For a list of types of corporation and other business types by country  see Types of business entity  Depending on the jurisdiction  there are four types of corporations  of which a particular jurisdiction will allow two of them  The types of corporations which a jurisdiction will charter either are for profit corporations and not for profit corporations  or it will charter stock corporations and non stock corporations  The main difference is that a corporation that is for profit is usually a stock corporation  but can be a non stock corporation  but a not for profit corporation is always a non stock corporation  Most corporations are registered with the local jurisdiction as either a stock corporation or a non stock corporation  Stock corporations sell stock to generate capital  A stock corporation must always be a for profit corporation  A non stock corporation cannot have stockholders  but may have members who have voting rights in the corporation  Some jurisdictions  Washington  D C   for example  separate corporations into for profit and non profit  as opposed to dividing into stock and non stock  Several states also allow a variation of the corporation for use by professionals  i e   those individuals typically considered as professionals who require a license from the state to conduct business   In some states  such as Georgia  these corporations are known as  professional corporations   A professional corporation will always be a for profit corporation   edit  For profit and non profit Main article  non profit organization In modern economic systems  conventions of corporate governance commonly appear in a wide variety of business and non profit activities  Though the laws governing these creatures of statute often differ  the courts often interpret provisions of the law that apply to profit making enterprises in the same manner  or in a similar manner  when applying principles to non profit organizations   as the underlying structures of these two types of entity often resemble each other   edit  Closely held corporations and publicly traded corporations This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  The institution most often referenced by the word  corporation  is a publicly traded corporation  the shares of which are traded on a public stock exchange  for example  the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq in the United States  where shares of stock of corporations are bought and sold by and to the general public  Most of the largest businesses in the world are publicly traded corporations  However  the majority of corporations are said to be closely held  privately held or close corporations  meaning that no ready market exists for the trading of shares  Many such corporations are owned and managed by a small group of businesspeople or companies  although the size of such a corporation can be as vast as the largest public corporations  Closely held corporations do have some advantages over publicly traded corporations  A small  closely held company can often make company changing decisions much more rapidly than a publicly traded company  A publicly traded company is also at the mercy of the market  having capital flow in and out based not only on what the company is doing but the market and even what the competitors are doing  Publicly traded companies also have advantages over their closely held counterparts  Publicly traded companies often have more working capital and can delegate debt throughout all shareholders  This means that people invested in a publicly traded company will each take a much smaller hit to their own capital as opposed to those involved with a closely held corporation  Publicly traded companies though suffer from this exact advantage  A closely held corporation can often voluntarily take a hit to profit with little to no repercussions  as long as it is not a sustained loss   A publicly traded company though often comes under extreme scrutiny if profit and growth are not evident to stock holders  thus stock holders may sell  further damaging the company  Often this blow is enough to make a small public company fail  Often communities benefit from a closely held company more so than from a public company  A closely held company is far more likely to stay in a single place that has treated them well  even if going through hard times  The shareholders can incur some of the damage the company may receive from a bad year or slow period in the company profits  Closely held companies often have a better relationship with workers  In larger  publicly traded companies  often when a year has gone badly the first area to feel the effects are the work force with lay offs or worker hours  wages or benefits being cut  Again  in a closely held business the shareholders can incur this profit damage rather than passing it to the workers  The affairs of publicly traded and closely held corporations are similar in many respects  The main difference in most countries is that publicly traded corporations have the burden of complying with additional securities laws  which  especially in the U S   may require additional periodic disclosure  with more stringent requirements   stricter corporate governance standards  and additional procedural obligations in connection with major corporate transactions  for example  mergers  or events  for example  elections of directors   A closely held corporation may be a subsidiary of another corporation  its parent company   which may itself be either a closely held or a public corporation  In some jurisdictions  the subsidiary of a listed public corporation is also defined as a public corporation  for example  Australia    edit  Benefit corporation Main article  Benefit corporation A benefit corporation  or in short hand a B corporation  is a class of corporation required by law to create general benefit for society as well as for shareholders  Benefit Corporations must create a material positive impact on society  and consider how their decisions affect their employees  community  and the environment  Moreover  they must publicly report on their social and environmental performances using established third party standards  31  The chartering of Benefit Corporations is an attempt to reclaim the original purpose for which corporations were chartered in early America  Then  states chartered corporations to achieve a specific public purpose  such as building bridges or roads  Their legitimacy stemmed from their delegated charter  although they could still earn profits while fulfilling it  Over time  however  corporations came to be chartered without any public purpose  while being legally bound to the singular purpose of profit maximization for its shareholders  Advocates of Benefit Corporations assert that this singular focus has resulted in a variety of societal ills  including the thwarting of democracy  diminished social good  and negative environmental impacts  32  In April 2010  Maryland became the first U S  state to pass Benefit Corporation legislation  Hawaii  Virginia  California  Vermont  and New Jersey soon followed  Additionally  as of November 2011  Benefit Corporation legislation had been introduced or partially passed in Colorado  New York  North Carolina  Pennsylvania  and Michigan  33  Benefit Corporation laws address concerns held by entrepreneurs who wish to raise growth capital but fear losing control of the social or environmental mission of their business  In addition  the laws provide companies the ability to consider factors other than the highest purchase offer at the time of sale  in spite of the ruling on Revlon  Inc  v  MacAndrews  amp  Forbes Holdings  Inc   Chartering as a Benefit Corporation also allows companies to distinguish themselves as businesses with a social conscience  and as one that aspires to a standard they consider higher than mere profit maximization for shareholders  34   edit  Mutual benefit corporations A mutual benefit nonprofit corporation is a corporation formed in the United States solely for the benefit of its members  An example of a mutual benefit nonprofit corporation is a golf club  Individuals pay to join the club  memberships may be bought and sold  and any property owned by the club is distributed to its members if the club dissolves  The club can decide  in its corporate bylaws  how many members to have  and who can be a member  Generally  while it is a nonprofit corporation  a mutual benefit corporation is not a charity  Because it is not a charity  a mutual benefit nonprofit corporation cannot obtain 501 c  3  status  If there is a dispute as to how a mutual benefit nonprofit corporation is being operated  it is up to the members to resolve the dispute since the corporation exists to solely serve the needs of its membership and not the general public  35   edit  Corporations globally Main article  Multinational corporation Following on the success of the corporate model at a national level  many corporations have become transnational or multinational corporations  growing beyond national boundaries to attain sometimes remarkable positions of power and influence in the process of globalizing  The typical  transnational  or  multinational  may fit into a web of overlapping shareholders and directorships  with multiple branches and lines in different regions  many such sub groupings comprising corporations in their own right  Growth by expansion may favor national or regional branches  growth by acquisition or merger can result in a plethora of groupings scattered around and or spanning the globe  with structures and names which do not always make clear the structures of shareholder ownership and interaction  In the spread of corporations across multiple continents  the importance of corporate culture has grown as a unifying factor and a counterweight to local national sensibilities and cultural awareness   edit  Australia Main article  Corporations Act 2001 In Australia corporations are registered and regulated by the Commonwealth Government through the Australian Securities and Investments Commission  Corporations law has been largely codified in the Corporations Act 2001   edit  Brazil In Brazil there are many different types of legal entities   sociedades    but the two most common ones commercially speaking are   i   sociedade limitada   identified by  Ltda   or  Limitada  after the company s name  equivalent to the British limited liability company  and  ii   sociedade an nima  or  companhia   identified by  S A   or  Companhia  in the company s name  equivalent to the British public limited company  The  Ltda   is mainly governed by the new Civil Code  enacted in 2002  and the  S A   by the Law 6 404 dated December 15  1976  as amended   edit  Canada Main article  Canadian corporation In Canada both the federal government and the provinces have corporate statutes  and thus a corporation may have a provincial or a federal charter  Many older corporations in Canada stem from Acts of Parliament passed before the introduction of general corporation law  The oldest corporation in Canada is the Hudson s Bay Company  though its business has always been based in Canada  its Royal Charter was issued in England by King Charles II in 1670  and became a Canadian charter by amendment in 1970 when it moved its corporate headquarters from London to Canada  Federally recognized corporations are regulated by the Canada Business Corporations Act   edit  German speaking countries Main article  Aktiengesellschaft Germany  Austria  Switzerland and Liechtenstein recognize two forms of company limited by shares  the Aktiengesellschaft  AG   analogous to public limited companies  or corporations in US Can  in the English speaking world  and the Gesellschaft mit beschr nkter Haftung  GmbH   similar to the modern private limited company   edit  Italy Italy recognizes three types of company limited by shares  the private limited company  societ  a responsabilit  limitata  or S r l   public limited company  societ  per azioni  or S p A   and the publicly traded partnership  societ  in accomandita per azioni  or S a p a    The latter is a hybrid of the limited partnership and public limited company  having two categories of shareholders  some with and some without limited liability  and is rarely used in practice   edit  Japan In Japan  both the state and local public entities under the Local Autonomy Law  prefectures and municipalities  are considered to be corporations      h jin    Non profit corporations may be established under the Civil Code  The term  company       kaisha   is used to refer to business corporations  The predominant form is the kabushiki kaisha         used by public corporations as well as smaller enterprises  Mochibun kaisha         a form for smaller enterprises  are becoming increasingly common  Between 2002 and 2008  the intermediary corporation        ch kan h jin   existed to bridge the gap between for profit companies and non governmental and non profit organizations   edit  Spain In Spain there are two types of companies  with limited liability called  S L   or  Sociedad Limitada   a private limited company  and  S A   or  Sociedad An nima   similar to a Public Limited Company    edit  United Kingdom Main article  UK company law In the United Kingdom   corporation  most commonly refers to a body corporate formed by Royal Charter or by statute  of which few now remain  The BBC is the oldest and best known corporation within the UK that is still in existence  Others  such as the British Steel Corporation  were privatized in the 1980s  In the private sector  corporations are referred to as companies  and are regulated by the Companies Act 2006  or the Northern Ireland equivalent   The most common type of company is the private limited company   Limited  or  Ltd     Private limited companies can either be limited by shares or by guarantee  Other corporate forms include the public limited company   PLC   and the private unlimited company  and companies limited by guarantee  A special type of corporation is a corporation sole  which is an office held by an individual natural person  the incumbent   but which has a continuing legal entity separate from that person  an example is a Church of England bishopric  edit  United States See also  Corporate law in the United States and Delaware corporation Several types of conventional corporations exist in the United States  Generically  any business entity that is recognized as distinct from the people who own it  i e   is not a sole proprietorship or a partnership  is a corporation  This generic label includes entities that are known by such legal labels as  association    organization  and  limited liability company   as well as corporations proper  Only a company that has been formally incorporated according to the laws of a particular state is called  corporation   A corporation was defined in the Dartmouth College case of 1819  in which Chief Justice Marshall of the United States Supreme Court stated that   A corporation is an artificial being  invisible  intangible  and existing only in contemplation of the law   A corporation is a legal entity  distinct and separate from the individuals who create and operate it  As legal entity the corporation can acquire  own  and dispose of property in its own name like buildings  land and equipment  It can also incur liabilities and enter into contracts like franchising and leasing  American corporations can be either profit making companies or non profit entities  Tax exempt non profit corporations are often called  501 c 3 corporation   after the section of the Internal Revenue Code that addresses the tax exemption for many of them  In some states  such as Colorado  a corporation may represent itself pro se in courts of law in some situations  36  The federal government can only create corporate entities pursuant to relevant powers in the U S  Constitution  For example  Congress has constitutional power to provide postal services  so it has power to operate the United States Postal Service  Although the federal government could theoretically preempt all state corporate law under the courts  current expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause  it has chosen not to do so  As a result  much of American corporate law continues to be a matter of state law under the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  Thus  virtually all corporations in the U S  are incorporated under the laws of a particular state  All states have some kind of  general corporation law   California  Delaware  Kansas  Nevada and Ohio actually use that exact name  which authorizes the formation of private corporations without having to obtain a charter for each one from the state legislature  as was formerly the case in the 19th century   Many states have separate  self contained laws authorizing the formation and operation of certain specific types of corporations that are wholly independent of the state general corporation law  For example  in California  nonprofit corporations are incorporated under the Nonprofit Corporation Law  and in Illinois  insurers are incorporated under the Illinois Insurance Code  Corporations are created by filing the requisite documents with a particular state government  The process is called  incorporation   referring to the abstract concept of clothing the entity with a  veil  of artificial personhood  embodying  or  corporating  it   corpus  being the Latin word for  body    Only certain corporations  including banks  are chartered  Others simply file their articles of incorporation with the state government as part of a registration process  Once incorporated  a corporation has artificial personhood everywhere it may operate  until such time as the corporation may be dissolved  A corporation that operates in one state while being incorporated in another is a  foreign corporation   This label also applies to corporations incorporated outside of the United States  Foreign corporations must usually register with the secretary of state s office in each state to lawfully conduct business in that state  A corporation is legally a citizen of the state  or other jurisdiction  in which it is incorporated  except when circumstances direct the corporation be classified as a citizen of the state in which it has its head office  or the state in which it does the majority of its business   Corporate business law differs dramatically from state to state  Many prospective corporations choose to incorporate in a state whose laws are most favorable to its business interests  Many large corporations are incorporated in Delaware  for example  without being physically located there because that state has very favorable corporate tax and disclosure laws  Companies set up for privacy or asset protection often incorporate in Nevada  which does not require disclosure of share ownership  Many states  particularly smaller ones  have modeled their corporate statutes after the Model Business Corporation Act  one of many model sets of law prepared and published by the American Bar Association  As juristic persons  corporations have certain rights that attach to natural persons  The vast majority of them attach to corporations under state law  especially the law of the state in which the company is incorporated   since the corporations very existence is predicated on the laws of that state  A few rights also attach by federal constitutional and statutory law  but they are few and far between compared to the rights of natural persons  For example  a corporation has the personal right to bring a lawsuit  as well as the capacity to be sued  and  like a natural person  a corporation can be libeled  But a corporation has no constitutional right to freely exercise its religion because religious exercise is something that only  natural  persons can do  That is  only human beings  not business entities  have the necessary faculties of belief and spirituality that enable them to possess and exercise religious beliefs  Harvard College  a component of Harvard University   formally the President and Fellows of Harvard College  also known as the Harvard Corporation   is the oldest corporation in the western hemisphere  Founded in 1636  the second of Harvard s two governing boards was incorporated by the Great and General Court of Massachusetts in 1650  Significantly  Massachusetts itself was a corporate colony at that time   owned and operated by the Massachusetts Bay Company  until it lost its charter in 1684    so Harvard College is a corporation created by a corporation  Many nations have modeled their own corporate laws on American business law  Corporate law in Saudi Arabia  for example  follows the model of New York State corporate law  In addition to typical corporations in the United States  the federal government  in 1971 passed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act  ANCSA   which authorized the creation of 12 regional native corporations for Alaska Natives and over 200 village corporations that were entitled to a settlement of land and cash  In addition to the 12 regional corporations  the legislation permitted a 13th regional corporation without a land settlement for those Alaska Natives living out of the State of Alaska at the time of passage of ANCSA   edit  Corporate taxation Main article  Corporate tax In many countries corporate profits are taxed at a corporate tax rate  and dividends paid to shareholders are taxed at a separate rate  Such a system is sometimes referred to as  double taxation   because any profits distributed to shareholders will eventually be taxed twice  One solution to this  as in the case of the Australian and UK tax systems  is for the recipient of the dividend to be entitled to a tax credit which addresses the fact that the profits represented by the dividend have already been taxed  The company profit being passed on is therefore effectively only taxed at the rate of tax paid by the eventual recipient of the dividend  In other systems  dividends are taxed at a lower rate than other income  for example  in the US  or shareholders are taxed directly on the corporation s profits and dividends are not taxed  for example  S corporations in the US    edit  Criticisms Main article  Criticisms of corporations As Adam Smith pointed out in the Wealth of Nations  when ownership is separated from management  i e  the actual production process required to obtain the capital   the latter will inevitably begin to neglect the interests of the former  creating dysfunction within the company  37  Some maintain that recent events in corporate America may serve to reinforce Smith s warnings about the dangers of legally protected collectivist hierarchies  38   edit  Other business entities Main article  Types of business entity Almost every recognized type of organization

of the 1977 revision of the California General Corporation Law considered the possibility of forcing all California corporations to have a name indicating corporate status  but decided against it because of the huge number of corporations that would have had to change their names  and the lack of any evidence that anyone had been harmed in California by entities whose corporate status was not immediately apparent from their names  However  the 1977 drafters were able to impose the current disclosure requirement for close corporations  See Harold Marsh  Jr   R  Roy Finkle  Larry W  Sonsini
