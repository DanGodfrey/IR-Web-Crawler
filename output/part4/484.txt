Founding Father who was the principal author of the United States Declaration of Independence  1776  and the third President of the United States  1801 1809   At the beginning of the American Revolution  Jefferson served in the Continental Congress  representing Virginia  He then served as a wartime Governor of Virginia  1779 1781   In 1768 he designed and built a large mansion on a 5 000 acre plantation near Charlottesville  Virginia  which he named Monticello  Just after the war ended  from mid 1784 Jefferson served as a diplomat  stationed in Paris  initially as a commissioner to help negotiate commercial treaties  In May 1785  he became the United States Minister to France  He was the first United States Secretary of State  1790 1793  during the administration of President George Washington  Upon resigning his office  with his close friend James Madison he organized the Democratic Republican Party  Elected Vice President in 1796 opposed to John Adams  Jefferson with Madison secretly wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions  which attempted to nullify the Alien and Sedition Acts and formed the basis of states  rights  Elected president in what Jefferson called the Revolution of 1800  he oversaw a peaceful transition in power  purchased the vast Louisiana Territory from France  1803   and sent the Lewis and Clark Expedition  1804 1806  to explore the new west  His second term was beset with troubles at home  such as the failed treason trial of his former Vice President Aaron Burr  and escalating trouble with Britain  With Britain at war with Napoleon  he tried aggressive economic warfare  however  his embargo laws did more damage to American trade and the economy  and provoked a furious reaction in the Northeast  Jefferson has often been rated in scholarly surveys as one of the greatest U S  presidents  though since the mid twentieth century  some historians have increasingly criticized him  1  2  A leader in the Enlightenment  Jefferson was a polymath who spoke five languages and was deeply interested in science  religion and philosophy  His interests led him to assist in founding the University of Virginia in his post presidency years  While not an orator  he was an indefatigable letter writer and corresponded with many influential people in America and Europe  As part of the Virginia planter elite and  as a tobacco planter  Jefferson owned hundreds of slaves throughout his lifetime  Like many of his contemporaries  he viewed Africans as being racially inferior  His views on slavery were complex  and changed over the course of his life  He was a leading American opponent of the international slave trade  and signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves on March 2  1807  After Martha Jefferson  his wife of eleven years  died in 1782  Thomas remained a widower for the rest of his life  his marriage produced six children  with only two surviving to adulthood  In 1802 allegations surfaced that he was also the father of his house slave Sally Hemings  children  In 1998  DNA tests revealed a match between her last child and the Jefferson male family line  The paternity of these children remains a matter of debate among historians  Contents 1 Early life and career 1 1 Education 1 2 Marriage and family 1 3 Monticello 1 4 Lawyer and House of Burgesses 2 Political career from 1775 to 1800 2 1 Declaration

career Main article  Ancestry of Thomas Jefferson The third of ten children  Thomas Jefferson was born on April 13  1743  April 2  1743 O S   Note 1  at the family home in Shadwell  Goochland County  Virginia  now part of Albemarle County  3  His father was Peter Jefferson  a planter and slaveholder  and a surveyor  4  He was of possible Welsh descent  although this remains unclear  5  His mother was Jane Randolph  daughter of Isham Randolph  a ship s captain and sometime planter  Peter and Jane married in 1739  6  Thomas Jefferson was little interested and indifferent to his ancestry and he only knew of the existence of his paternal grandfather  5  Before the widower William Randolph  an old friend of Peter Jefferson  died in 1745  he appointed Peter as guardian to manage his Tuckahoe Plantation and care for his four children  That year the Jeffersons relocated to Tuckahoe  where they lived for the next seven years before returning to Shadwell in 1752  Here Thomas Jefferson recorded his earliest memory  that of being carried on a pillow by a slave during the move to Tuckahoe  7  Peter Jefferson died in 1757 and the Jefferson estate was divided between Peter s two sons  Thomas and Randolph  8  Thomas inherited approximately 5 000 acres  2 000 ha  7 8 sq mi  of land  including Monticello and between 20 40 slaves  He took control of the property after he came of age at 21  9  On October 1  1765  when Jefferson was 22  his oldest sister Jane died at the age of 25  10  He fell into a period of deep mourning  as he was already saddened by the absence of his sisters Mary  who had been married several years to Thomas Bolling  and Martha  who in July had wed Dabney Carr  10  Both lived at their husbands  residences  Only Jefferson s younger siblings Elizabeth  Lucy  and the two toddlers  were at home  He drew little comfort from the younger ones  as they did not provide him with the same intellectual engagement as the older sisters had  10  According to the historian Ferling  while growing up Jefferson struggled with loneliness and abandonment issues that eventually developed into a reclusive lifestyle as an adult  11  Education Further information  Thomas Jefferson and education Jefferson began his childhood education under the direction of tutors at Tuckahoe along with the Randolph children  12  In 1752  Jefferson began attending a local school run by a Scottish Presbyterian minister  At the age of nine  Jefferson began studying Latin  Greek  and French  he learned to ride horses  and began to appreciate the study of nature  He studied under the Reverend James Maury from 1758 to 1760 near Gordonsville  Virginia  While boarding with Maury s family  he studied history  science and the classics  13  At age 16  Jefferson entered the College of William  amp  Mary in Williamsburg  and first met the law professor George Wythe  who became his influential mentor  For two years he studied mathematics  metaphysics  and philosophy under Professor William Small  who introduced the enthusiastic Jefferson to the writings of the British Empiricists  including John Locke  Francis Bacon  and Isaac Newton  14  He also improved his French  Greek  and violin  A diligent student  Jefferson displayed an avid curiosity in all fields 15  and graduated in 1762 with highest honors  citation needed  Jefferson read law while working as a law clerk for Wythe  During this time  he also read a wide variety of English classics and political works  Jefferson was admitted to the Virginia bar five years later in 1767  16  Throughout his life  Jefferson depended on books for his education  He collected and accumulated thousands of books for his library at Monticello  When Jefferson s father Peter died Thomas inherited  among other things  his large library   17  A significant portion of Jefferson s library was also bequeathed to him in the will of George Wythe  who had an extensive collection  Always eager for more knowledge  Jefferson continued learning throughout most of his life  Jefferson once said   I cannot live without books   18  Marriage and family After practicing as a circuit lawyer for several years  19  Jefferson married the 23 year old widow Martha Wayles Skelton  The wedding was celebrated on January 1  1772 at Martha s home  an estate called  The Forest  near Williamsburg  Virginia  20  Martha Jefferson was described as attractive  gracious and popular with their friends  she was a frequent hostess for Jefferson and managed the large household  They were said to have a happy marriage  She read widely  did fine needle work and was an amateur musician  Jefferson played the violin and Martha was an accomplished piano player  It is said that she was attracted to Thomas largely because of their mutual love of music  20  21  One of the wedding gifts he gave to Martha was a  forte piano   22  During the ten years of their marriage  she had six children  Martha Washington  called Patsy   1772 1836   Jane  1774 1775   a stillborn or unnamed son in 1777  Mary Wayles  1778 1804   called Polly  Lucy Elizabeth  1780 1781   and Lucy Elizabeth  1782 1785   Two survived to adulthood  22  After her father John Wayles died in 1773  Martha and her husband Jefferson inherited his 135 slaves  11 000 acres and the debts of his estate  These took Jefferson and other co executors of the estate years to pay off  which contributed to his financial problems  Among the slaves were Betty Hemings and her 10 children  the six youngest were half siblings of Martha Wayles Jefferson  as they are believed to have been children of her father  Note 2  and they were three quarters European in ancestry  The youngest  an infant  was Sally Hemings  As they grew and were trained  all the Hemings family members were assigned to privileged positions among the slaves at Monticello  as domestic servants  chefs  and highly skilled artisans  23  Later in life  Martha Jefferson suffered from diabetes and ill health  and frequent childbirth further weakened her  A few months after the birth of her last child  Martha died on September 6  1782  Jefferson was at his wife s bedside and was distraught after her death  In the following three weeks  Jefferson shut himself in his room  where he paced back and forth until he was nearly exhausted  Later he would often take long rides on secluded roads to mourn for his wife  21  22  As he had promised his wife  Jefferson never remarried  Jefferson s oldest daughter Martha  called Patsy  married Thomas Mann Randolph  Jr  in 1790  They had 12 children  eleven of whom survived to adulthood  She suffered severe problems as Randolph became alcoholic and was abusive  When they separated for several years  Martha and her many children lived at Monticello with her father  adding to his financial burdens  Her oldest son  Thomas Jefferson Randolph  helped her run Monticello for a time after her father s death  She had the longest life of Jefferson s children by Martha  22  Mary Jefferson  called Polly and Maria  married her first cousin John Wayles Eppes in 1797  As a wedding settlement  Jefferson gave them Betsy Hemmings  the 14 year old granddaughter of Betty Hemings  and 30 other slaves  24  The Eppes had three children together  but only a son survived  Frail like her mother  Maria died at the age of 25  several months after her third child was born  It also died  and only her son Francis W  Eppes survived to adulthood  cared for by slaves  his father and  after five years  a stepmother  24  25  Monticello Further information  Monticello and Jeffersonian architecture West lawn in October 2010 In 1768 Jefferson started the construction of Monticello  a neoclassical mansion on 5 000 acres which he designed himself  Since childhood  Jefferson had always wanted to build a mountaintop home within sight of his former home of Shadwell  26  27  Jefferson moved into the South Pavilion  an outbuilding  in 1770  where his new wife Martha joined him in 1772  Monticello would be his continuing project to create a neoclassical environment  based on his study of the architect Andrea Palladio and the classical orders  28  While Minister to France during 1784 1789  he had an opportunity to see some of the classical buildings with which he had become acquainted from his reading  as well as to discover the  modern  trends in French architecture then fashionable in Paris  In 1794  following his service as Secretary of State  1790 93   he began rebuilding Monticello based on the ideas he had acquired in Europe  The remodeling continued throughout most of his presidency  1801 09   29  The most notable change was the addition of the octagonal dome  30  Lawyer and House of Burgesses Jefferson handled many cases as a lawyer in colonial Virginia  and was very active from 1768 to 1773  31  Jefferson s client list included members of the Virginia s elite families  including members of his mother s family  the Randolphs  31  Beside practicing law  Jefferson represented Albemarle County in the Virginia House of Burgesses beginning on May 11  1769 and ending June 20  1775  32  His friend and mentor George Wythe served at the same time  Following the passage of the Coercive Acts by the British Parliament in 1774  Jefferson wrote a set of resolutions against the acts  which were expanded into A Summary View of the Rights of British America  his first published work  Previous criticism of the Coercive Acts had focused on legal and constitutional issues  but Jefferson offered the radical notion that the colonists had the natural right to govern themselves  33  Jefferson argued that Parliament was the legislature of Great Britain only  and had no legislative authority in the colonies  The paper was intended to serve as instructions for the Virginia delegation of the First Continental Congress  but Jefferson s ideas proved to be too radical for that body  citation needed  Political career from 1775 to 1800 Declaration of Independence In John Trumbull s painting Declaration of Independence  the five man drafting committee is presenting its work to the Continental Congress  Main article  United States Declaration of Independence Thomas Jefferson was the principle author of the Declaration of Independence  a formal document which officially proclaimed the dissolution of the American colonies from the British Crown  The sentiments of revolution put forth in the Declaration were already well established in 1776 as the colonies were already at war with the British when the Declaration was being debated  drafted and signed   34  35  Before the Declaration was drafted Jefferson served as a delegate from Virginia to the Second Continental Congress beginning in June 1775  soon after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War  He sought out John Adams who  along with his cousin Samuel  had emerged as a leader of the convention  36  Jefferson and Adams established a lifelong friendship and would correspond frequently  Adams ensured that Jefferson was appointed to the five man committee to write a declaration in support of the resolution of independence  37  Having agreed on an approach  the committee selected Jefferson to write the first draft  His eloquent writing style made him the committee s choice for primary author  the others edited his draft  38  39  During June 1776  the month before the signing  Jefferson took notes of the Congressional debates over the proposed Declaration in order to include such sentiments in his draft  among other things justifying the right of citizens to resort to revolution  40  Jefferson also drew from his proposed draft of the Virginia Constitution  George Mason s draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights  and other sources  The historian Joseph Ellis states that the Declaration was the  core of  Jefferson  s seductive appeal across the ages   41  After working for two days to modify the document  Congress removed language that was deemed antagonistic to friends in Britain and Jefferson s clause that indicted the British monarchy for imposing African slavery on the colonies  This was the longest clause removed  40  Congress trimmed the draft by about one fourth  wanting the Declaration to appeal to the population in Great Britain as well as the soon to be United States  while at the same time not wanting to give South Carolina and Georgia reasons to oppose the Declaration on abolitionist grounds  Jefferson deeply resented some of the many omissions Congress made  40  42  On July 4  1776  Congress ratified the Declaration of Independence and distributed the document  43  Historians have considered it to be one of Jefferson s major achievements  the preamble is considered an enduring statement of human rights that has inspired people around the world  44  Its second sentence is the following  We hold these truths to be self evident  that all men are created equal  that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights  that among these are Life  Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness  This has been called  one of the best known sentences in the English language   45  containing  the most potent and consequential words in American history   46  The passage came to represent a moral standard to which the United States should strive  This view was notably promoted by Abraham Lincoln  who based his philosophy on it  and argued for the Declaration as a statement of principles through which the United States Constitution should be interpreted  47  Intended as a revolutionary document for the world  not just the colonies  the Declaration was Jefferson s assertion of his core beliefs in a republican form of government  40  Virginia state legislator and Governor This article

January 2012  After Independence  Jefferson desired to reform the Virginia government  48  In September 1776  eager to work on creating the new government and dismantle the feudal aspects of the old  Jefferson returned to Virginia and was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates for Albemarle County  49  Before his return  he had contributed to the state s constitution from Philadelphia  he continued to support freehold suffrage  by which only property holders could vote  50   Jefferson attempted to establish himself as a foe of slavery during the Revolution  however  the 21st century historian John Ferling has called this mostly  hyperbole   48  He served as a Delegate from September 26  1776   June 1  1779  as the war continued  Jefferson worked on Revision of Laws to reflect Virginia s new status as a democratic state  By abolishing primogeniture  establishing freedom of religion  and providing for general education  he hoped to make the basis of  republican government    50  Ending the Anglican Church as the state  or established  religion was a first step  Jefferson introduced his  Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom  in 1779  but it was not enacted until 1786  while he was in France as US Minister  51  In 1778 Jefferson supported a bill to prohibit the international slave trade in Virginia  the state was the first in the union to adopt such legislation  This was significant as the slave trade would be protected from regulation for 20 years at the federal level under the new Constitution in 1787  Abolitionists in Virginia expected the new law to be followed by gradual emancipation  as Jefferson had supported this by opinion  but he discouraged such action while in the Assembly  Following his departure  the Assembly passed a law in 1782 making manumission easier  As a result  the number of free blacks in Virginia rose markedly by 1810  from 1800 in 1782 to 12 766 in 1790  and to 30 570 by 1810  when they formed 8 2 percent of the black population in the state  52  He drafted 126 bills in three years  including laws to establish fee simple tenure in land  which removed inheritance strictures  and to streamline the judicial system  In 1778  Jefferson s  Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge  and subsequent efforts to reduce control by clergy led to some small changes at William and Mary College  but free public education was not established until the late nineteenth century after the Civil War  53  Jefferson proposed a bill to eliminate capital punishment in Virginia for all crimes except murder and treason  but his effort was defeated  54  In 1779  at Jefferson s behest  William and Mary appointed his mentor George Wythe as the first professor of law in an American university  55  In 1779  at the age of thirty six  Jefferson was elected Governor of Virginia by the two houses of the legislature  as was the process  56  The term was then for one year  and he was re elected in 1780  As governor in 1780  he transferred the state capital from Williamsburg to Richmond  He served as a wartime governor  as the united colonies continued the Revolutionary War against Great Britain  By this time  Georgia had fallen to the British  whose forces had invaded South Carolina and threatened Charleston  citation needed  In late 1780  Governor Jefferson prepared Richmond for attack by moving all arms  military supplies and records to a foundry located five miles outside of town  General Benedict Arnold  who had switched to the British side in 1780  learned of the transfer and moved to capture the foundry  Jefferson tried to get the supplies moved to Westham  seven miles to the north  but he was too late  He also delayed too long in raising a militia  Arnold s troops burned the foundry before returning to Richmond  where they burned much of the city the following morning  57  With the Assembly  Jefferson evacuated the government in January 1781 from Richmond to Charlottesville  They began to meet at his home of Monticello  The government had moved so rapidly that he left his household slaves in Richmond  where they were captured as prisoners of war by the British and later exchanged for soldiers  In January 1781  Benedict Arnold led an armada of British ships and  with 1600 British regulars  conducted raids along the James River  Later Arnold would join Lord Cornwallis  whose troops were marching across Virginia from the south  In early June 1781  Cornwallis dispatched a 250 man cavalry force commanded by Banastre Tarleton on a secret expedition to capture Governor Jefferson and members of the Assembly at Monticello  56  Tarleton hoped to surprise Jefferson  but Jack Jouett  a captain in the Virginia militia  thwarted the British plan by warning the governor and members of the Assembly  58  Jefferson and his family escaped and fled to Poplar Forest  his plantation to the west  Tarleton did not allow looting or destruction at Monticello by his troops  By contrast  when Lord Cornwallis and his sizeable number of troops later occupied Elkhill  a smaller estate of Jefferson s on the James River in Goochland County  they stripped it of resources and left it in ruins  According to a letter by Jefferson about Elkhill  British troops destroyed all his crops  burned his barns and fences  slaughtered or drove off the livestock  seized usable horses  cut the throats of foals and  after setting fires  left the plantation a waste  They captured 27 slaves and held them as prisoners of war  At least 24 died in the camp of diseases  59  a chronic problem for prisoners and troops in an era of poor sanitation  According to Jefferson  he believed his gubernatorial term had expired in June  and he spent much of the summer with his family at Poplar Forest  58  The members of the General Assembly had quickly reconvened in June 1781 in Staunton  Virginia across the Blue Ridge Mountains  They voted to reward Jouett with a pair of pistols and a sword  but considered an official inquiry into Jefferson s actions  as they believed he had failed his responsibilities as governor   The inquiry ultimately was dropped  yet Jefferson insisted on appearing before the lawmakers in December to respond to charges of mishandling his duties and abandoning leadership at a critical moment  He reported that he had believed it understood that he was leaving office and that he had discussed with other legislators the advantages of Gen  Thomas Nelson  a commander of the state militia  being appointed governor   58   The legislature did appoint Nelson as governor in late June 1781    Jefferson was a controversial figure at this time  heavily criticized for inaction and failure to adequately protect the state in the face of a British invasion  Even on balance  Jefferson had been a very poor state executive  and left his successor  Thomas Nelson  Jr   to pick up the pieces   60  He was not re elected again to office in Virginia  48  Notes on the State of Virginia Main article  Notes on the State of Virginia In 1780 Jefferson as governor received numerous questions about Virginia  posed to him by Fran ois Barb  Marbois  then Secretary of the French delegation in Philadelphia  the temporary capital of the united colonies  who intended to gather pertinent data on the American colonies  Jefferson s responses to Marbois   Queries  would become known as Notes on the State of Virginia  1785   Scientifically trained  Jefferson was a member of the American Philosophical Society  which had been founded in Philadelphia in 1743  He had extensive knowledge of western lands from Virginia to Illinois  In a course of 5 years  Jefferson enthusiastically devoted his intellectual energy to the book  he included a discussion of contemporary scientific knowledge  and Virginia s history  politics  and ethnography  Jefferson was aided by Thomas Walker  George R  Clark  and U S  geographer Thomas Hutchins  The book was first published in France in 1785 and in England in 1787  61  It has been ranked as the most important American book published before 1800  The book is Jefferson s vigorous and often eloquent argument about the nature of the good society  which he believed was incarnated by Virginia  In it he expressed his beliefs in the separation of church and state  constitutional government  checks and balances  and individual liberty  He also compiled extensive data about the state s natural resources and economy  He wrote extensively about the problems of slavery  miscegenation  and his belief that blacks and whites could not live together as free people in one society  Member of Congress and Minister to France Following its victory in the war and peace treaty with Great Britain  in 1783 the United States formed a Congress of the Confederation  informally called the Continental Congress   to which Jefferson was appointed as a Virginia delegate  As a member of the committee formed to set foreign exchange rates  he recommended that American currency should be based on the decimal system  his plan was adopted  Jefferson also recommended setting up the Committee of the States  to function as the executive arm of Congress  The plan was adopted but failed in practice  Jefferson was  one of the first statesman in any part of the world to advocate concrete measures for restricting and eradicating Negro slavery   62  Jefferson wrote an ordinance banning slavery in all the nation s territories  not just the Northwest   but it failed by one vote  The subsequent Northwest Ordinance prohibited slavery in the newly organized territory  but it did nothing to free slaves who were already held by settlers there  this required later actions  Jefferson was in France when the Northwest Ordinance was passed  63  He resigned from Congress when he was appointed by George Washington s administration as minister to France in May 1784  Memorial plaque marking where Jefferson lived while he was Minister to France  The widower Jefferson  still in his 40s  was minister to France from 1785 to 1789  the year the French Revolution started  When the French foreign minister  the Count de Vergennes  commented to Jefferson   You replace Monsieur Franklin  I hear   Jefferson replied   I succeed him  No man can replace him   64  Beginning in early September 1785  Jefferson collaborated with John Adams  US minister in London  to outline an anti piracy treaty with Morocco  Their work culminated in a treaty that was ratified by Congress on July 18  1787  Still in force today  it is the longest unbroken treaty relationship in U S  history  65  Busy in Paris  Jefferson did not return to the US for the 1787 Constitutional Convention  He enjoyed the architecture  arts  and the salon culture of Paris  He often dined with many of the city s most prominent people  and stocked up on wines to take back to the US  66  While in Paris  Jefferson corresponded with many people who had important roles in the imminent French Revolution  These included the Marquis de Lafayette  and the Comte de Mirabeau  a popular pamphleteer who repeated ideals that had been the basis for the American Revolution  67  His observations of social tensions contributed to his anti clericalism and strengthened his ideas about the separation of church and state  citation needed  Jefferson s eldest daughter Martha  known as Patsy  went with him to France in 1784  His two youngest daughters were in the care of friends in the United States  56  To serve the household  Jefferson brought some of his slaves  including James Hemings  who trained as a French chef for his master s service  Jefferson s youngest daughter Lucy died of whooping cough in 1785 in the United States  and he was bereft  60  In 1786  Jefferson met and fell in love with Maria Cosway  an accomplished Italian English artist and musician of 27  They saw each other frequently over a period of six weeks  A married woman  she returned to Great Britain  but they maintained a lifelong correspondence  60  In 1787  Jefferson sent for his youngest surviving child  Polly  then age nine  He requested that a slave accompany Polly on the trans Atlantic voyage  By chance  Sally Hemings  a younger sister of James  was chosen  she lived in the Jefferson household in Paris for about two years  According to her son Madison Hemings  Sally and Jefferson began a sexual relationship in Paris and she became pregnant  68  She agreed to return to the United States as his concubine after he promised to free her children when they came of age  68  Secretary of State In September 1789 Jefferson returned to the US from France with his two daughters and slaves  Immediately upon his return  President Washington wrote to him asking him to accept a seat in his Cabinet as Secretary of State  Jefferson accepted the appointment  As Washington s Secretary of State  1790 1793   Jefferson argued with Alexander Hamilton  the Secretary of Treasury  about national fiscal policy  69  especially the funding of the debts of the war  Jefferson later associated Hamilton and the Federalists with  Royalism   and said the  Hamiltonians were panting after   crowns  coronets and mitres   70  Due to their opposition to Hamilton  Jefferson and James Madison founded and led the Democratic Republican Party  He worked with Madison and his campaign manager John J  Beckley to build a nationwide network of Republican allies  Jefferson s political actions and his attempt to undermine Hamilton nearly led Washington to dismiss Jefferson from his cabinet  71  Though Jefferson left the cabinet voluntarily  Washington never forgave him for his actions  and never spoke to him again  71  The French minister said in 1793   Senator Morris and Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton   had the greatest influence over the President s mind  and that it was only with difficulty that he  Jefferson  counterbalanced their efforts   72  Jefferson supported France against Britain when they fought in 1793  73  Jefferson believed that political success at home depended on the success of the French army in Europe  74  In 1793  the French minister Edmond Charles Gen t caused a crisis when he tried to influence public opinion by appealing to the American people  something which Jefferson tried to stop  74  Jefferson tried to achieve three important goals during his discussions with George Hammond  British Minister to the U S   secure British admission of violating the Treaty of Paris  1783    vacate their posts in the Northwest  the territory between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River north of the Ohio   and compensate the United States to pay American slave owners for the slaves whom the British had freed and evacuated at the end of the war  Chester Miller notes that after failing to gain agreement on any of these  Jefferson resigned in December 1793  75  Election of 1796 and Vice Presidency Further information  United States presidential election  1796 In late 1793  Jefferson retired to Monticello  from where he continued to oppose the policies of Hamilton and Washington  The Jay Treaty of 1794  led by Hamilton  brought peace and trade with Britain   while Madison  with strong support from Jefferson  wanted  to strangle the former mother country  without going to war  76   It became an article of faith among Republicans that  commercial weapons  would suffice to bring Great Britain to any terms the United States chose to dictate   76  Even during the violence of the Reign of Terror in France  Jefferson refused to disavow the revolution because  To back away from France would be to undermine the cause of republicanism in America   77  As vice president  Jefferson conducted secret talks with the French  in which he advocated that the French government take a more aggressive position against the American government  which he thought was too close to the British  78  He succeeded in getting the American ambassador expelled from France  As the Democratic Republican presidential candidate in 1796  Jefferson lost to John Adams  but had enough electoral votes to become Vice President  1797 1801   One of the chief duties of a Vice president is presiding over the Senate  and Jefferson was concerned about its lack of rules leaving decisions to the discretion of the presiding officer  Years before holding his first office  Jefferson had spent much time researching procedures and rules for governing bodies  As a student  he had transcribed notes on British parliamentary law into a manual which he would later call his Parliamentary Pocket Book  Jefferson had also served on the committee appointed to draw up the rules of order for the Continental Congress in 1776  As Vice President  he was ready to reform Senatorial procedures  Prompted by the immediate need  he wrote A Manual of Parliamentary Practice  a document which the House of Representatives follows to the present day  79  With the Quasi War underway  the Federalists under John Adams started rebuilding the military  levied new taxes  and enacted the Alien and Sedition Acts  Jefferson believed that these acts were intended to suppress Democratic Republicans rather than dangerous enemy aliens  although the acts were allowed to expire  Jefferson and Madison rallied opposition support by anonymously writing the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions  which declared that the federal government had no right to exercise powers not specifically delegated to it by the states  80  Though the resolutions followed the  interposition  approach of Madison  Jefferson advocated nullification  At one point he drafted a threat for Kentucky to secede  Note 3  Jefferson s biographer Dumas Malone argued that had his actions become known at the time  Jefferson might have been impeached for treason  78  In writing the Kentucky Resolutions  Jefferson warned that   unless arrested at the threshold   the Alien and Sedition Acts would  necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood   78  The historian Ron Chernow says    H e wasn t calling for peaceful protests or civil disobedience  he was calling for outright rebellion  if needed  against the federal government of which he was vice president   81  Chernow believes that Jefferson  thus set forth a radical doctrine of states  rights that effectively undermined the constitution   81  He argues that neither Jefferson nor Madison sensed that they had sponsored measures as inimical as the Alien and Sedition Acts  81  The historian Garry Wills argued   Their nullification effort  if others had picked it up  would have been a greater threat to freedom than the misguided  alien and sedition  laws  which were soon rendered feckless by ridicule and electoral pressure   82  The theoretical damage of the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions was  deep and lasting  and was a recipe for disunion   81  George Washington was so appalled by them that he told Patrick Henry that if  systematically and pertinaciously pursued   they would  dissolve the union or produce coercion   81  The influence of Jefferson s doctrine of states  rights reverberated to the Civil War and beyond  83  According to Chernow  during the Quasi War  Jefferson engaged in a  secret campaign to sabotage Adams in French eyes   84  In the spring of 1797  he held four confidential talks with the French consul Joseph Letombe  In these private meetings  Jefferson attacked Adams  predicted that he would only serve one term  and encouraged France to invade England  84  Jefferson advised Letombe to stall any American envoys sent to Paris by instructing them to  listen to them and then drag out the negotiations at length and mollify them by the urbanity of the proceedings   This toughened the tone that the French government adopted with the new Adams Administration  84  Due to pressure against the Adams Administration from Jefferson and his supporters  Congress released the papers related to the XYZ Affair  which rallied a shift in popular opinion from Jefferson and the French government to supporting Adams  84  Presidency Main article  Presidency of Thomas Jefferson See also  First inauguration of Thomas Jefferson and Second inauguration of Thomas Jefferson Election of 1800 and first term Main article  United States presidential election  1800 Working closely with Aaron Burr of New York  Jefferson rallied his party  attacking the new taxes especially  and ran for the Presidency in 1800  Before the passage of the Twelfth Amendment  a problem with the new union s electoral system arose  Hamilton convinced his party that Jefferson would be a lesser political evil than Burr and that such scandal within the electoral process would undermine the new constitution  On February 17  1801  after thirty six ballots  the House elected Jefferson President and Burr Vice President  Jefferson owed his election victory to the South s inflated number of Electors  which counted slaves under the three fifths compromise  85  86  After his election in 1800  some called him the  Negro President   with critics like the Mercury and New England Palladium of Boston stating that Jefferson had the gall to celebrate his election as a victory for democracy when he won  the temple of Liberty on the shoulders of slaves   86  Thomas Jefferson took the oath of office on March 4  1801  at a time when partisan strife between the Democratic Republican and Federalist parties was growing to alarming proportions  Regarded by his supporters as the  People s President  news of Jefferson s election was well received in many parts of the new country and was marked by celebrations throughout the Union  He was sworn in by Chief Justice John Marshall at the new Capitol in Washington DC  In contrast to the preceding president John Adams  Jefferson exhibited a dislike of formal etiquette  Unlike Washington  who arrived at his inauguration in a stagecoach drawn by six cream colored horses  Jefferson arrived alone on horseback without guard or escort  He was dressed plainly and after dismounting  retired his own horse himself  87  As a result of his two predecessors  as well as the state of events in Europe  Jefferson inherited the presidency with relatively few urgent problems  Though he and his supporters attempted to dismantle several of the accomplishments of his two predecessors  notably the national bank  military  and federal taxation system  they were only partially successful  88  Administration  Cabinet and Supreme Court

became president in 1801  the United States was at the time paying  80 000 to the Barbary states as a  tribute  for protection against North African piracy  For decades  the pirates had been capturing American ships and crew members and demanding huge ransoms for their release  Before Independence  from 1775 until 1783  American merchant ships were protected from the Barbary pirates by the naval and diplomatic influence of Great Britain  When the American Revolution began  American ships were protected by the 1778 alliance with France  which required the French nation to protect  American vessels and effects against all violence  insults  attacks       On December 20  1777  Morocco s Sultan Mohammed III declared that the American merchant ships would be under the protection of the sultanate and could thus enjoy safe passage into the Mediterranean and along the coast  The Moroccan American Treaty of Friendship stands as the U S  s oldest non broken friendship treaty  89  90  The one with Morocco has been the longest lasting treaty with a foreign power  After the United States gained independence  it had to protect its own merchant vessels  It also had to pay  80 000 as tribute to the Barbary states  as did Britain and France at this time  When Tripoli made new demands on the new President for a prompt payment of  225 000 and an annual payment of  25 000  Jefferson refused and decided it would be easier to fight the pirates than to continue to pay bribes  On May 10  1801  the pasha of Tripoli declared war on the United States and the First Barbary War began  As secretary of state and vice president  Jefferson had opposed funds for a Navy to be used for anything more than a coastal defense  however the continued pirate attacks on American shipping interests in the Atlantic and Mediterranean and the systematic kidnapping of American crew members could no longer be ignored  President Jefferson ordered a fleet of naval vessels to various points in the Mediterranean  He forced Tunis and Algiers into breaking their alliance with Tripoli which ultimately forced it out of the fight  Jefferson also ordered five separate naval bombardments of Tripoli  which restored peace in the Mediterranean for a while  91  Louisiana Purchase Purchase area in green Main article  Louisiana Purchase In 1803 in the midst of the Napoleonic wars between France and Britain  Thomas Jefferson authorized the Louisiana Purchase  a major land acquisition from France that doubled the size of the United States  Most of France s wealth in the New World had come from its sugar plantations on Saint Domingue and Guadeloupe in the Caribbean  but production had fallen after a slave uprising  After sending more than 20 000 troops to try to regain the colony in 1802  France withdrew its 7 000 surviving troops in late 1803  shortly before Haiti declared independence  92  Having lost the revenue potential of Haiti while escalating his wars against the rest of Europe  Napoleon gave up on an empire in North America and used the purchase money to help finance France s war campaign on its home front  93  92  Jefferson had sent James Monroe and Robert R  Livingston to Paris in 1802 to try to buy the city of New Orleans and adjacent coastal areas  At Jefferson s request  Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours  a French nobleman who had close ties with both Jefferson and Napoleon  also helped negotiate the purchase with France  Napoleon offered to sell the entire Territory for a price of  15 million  which Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin financed easily  Seizing the opportunity Jefferson acted contrary to his usual requirement of explicit Constitutional authority  and the Federalists criticized him for acting without that authority  but most thought that this opportunity was exceptional and could not be missed  94  On December 20  1803 the French flag was lowered in New Orleans and the U S  flag raised  symbolizing the transfer of the Louisiana territory from France to the United States  95  Jefferson s decision would prove to be the most consequential presidential decision in American history   96  The territory was not finally secured until England and Mexico gave up their claims to northern and southern portions  respectively  during the presidency of James Polk  Without realizing it  at the time Jefferson had purchased one of the largest fertile tracts of land on the planet  As the purchase marked the end of French imperial ambitions in North America  the United States could develop a new national security strategy  Historians differ in their assessments as to who was the principal player in the purchase  the Jefferson biographer Peterson notes a range of opinion among those who credit Napoleon  or others who credit Jefferson  his secretary of state James Madison  and his negotiator James Monroe  Peterson agrees with Alexander Hamilton  Jefferson s arch rival  in attributing it to  dumb luck   97 Joseph Ellis  another biographer of Jefferson  believes the events encompassed a variety of elements  98  The historian George Herring has said that while the purchase was somewhat the result of Jefferson and Madison s  shrewd and sometimes belligerent diplomacy   that it  is often and rightly regarded as a diplomatic windfall the result of accident  luck  and the whim of Napoleon Bonaparte   99  With France removed as a threat  Jefferson followed the southern dominated Congress  which feared a slave revolt at home due to the rise of Haiti  The United States refused to recognized the new republic  the second in the Western Hemisphere  and imposed an arms and trade embargo against it  This made it difficult for the country to recover after the wars  100  Lewis and Clark Expedition Main article  Lewis and Clark Expedition Jefferson had an avid interest in the sciences and had long entertained ideas of exploring the American frontier before Louisiana was purchased from France  As such Jefferson was a member of the American Philosophical Society  founded in Philadelphia in 1743 by Benjamin Franklin  and served as its President from 1797 to 1815  By the turn of the 19th century  the society was well established and staffed  and equipped for research  Jefferson made use of its resources by sending Meriwether Lewis to Philadelphia in 1803 for instruction at the Society in botany  mathematics  surveying  astronomy  chemistry and map making  among other subjects  101  On January 18  1803  Jefferson sent a confidential letter to Congress asking for  2 500 to fund an expedition through the West  on February 28  1803  Congress appropriated the necessary funds  102  In 1804 Jefferson appointed Meriwether Lewis and William Clark as leaders of the expedition  1804 1806   which explored the Louisiana Territory and beyond  producing a wealth of scientific and geographical knowledge  and ultimately contributing to the European American settlement of the West  103  Knowledge of the western part of the continent had been scant and incomplete  limited to what had been learned from trappers  traders  and explorers  This was the first official American military expedition to the Pacific Coast  Lewis and Clark  for whom the expedition became known  recruited the 45 men to accompany them  and spent a winter training them near St  Louis for the effort  104  The expedition had several goals identified by Jefferson  including finding a  direct  amp  practicable water communication across this continent  for the purposes of commerce   the long sought Northwest Passage   104  They were to follow and map the rivers  and collect scientific data  He was deeply interested in opportunities for the lucrative fur trade  Jefferson wanted to establish a US claim of  discovery  of the Pacific Northwest by mapping and documenting a United States presence there before Europeans could claim the land  The expedition reached the Pacific Ocean by November 1805  With its return in 1806  it had fulfilled Jefferson s hopes by amassing much new data about the topographical features of the country and its natural resources  with details on the flora and fauna  as well as the many Indian tribes of the West with which he hoped to increase trading  105  Jefferson also commissioned the Pike expedition to explore the central region of the Louisiana Purchase  and the Red River Expedition  which was less successful  106  107  West Point Ideas for a national institution for military education were circulated during the American Revolution  In May 1801 the Secretary of War Henry Dearborn announced that the president had appointed Major Jonathan Williams  grandnephew of Benjamin Franklin  to direct organizing to establish such a school  108  Following the advice of George Washington  John Adams and others  109  in 1802 Jefferson convinced Congress to authorize the funding and construction of the United States Military Academy at West Point on the Hudson River in New York  On March 16  1802  Jefferson signed the Military Peace Establishment Act  directing that a corps of engineers be established and  constitute a Military Academy   110  The Act would provide well trained officers for a professional army  The officers would be reliable republicans rather than a closed elite as in Europe  for the cadets were to be appointed by Congressmen to reflect the nation s politics  On July 4  1802  the US Military Academy at West Point formally started as an institution for scientific and military learning  110  Native American policy Main article  Thomas Jefferson and Indian removal As governor of Virginia  1780 1781  during the Revolutionary War  Jefferson recommended forcibly moving Cherokee and Shawnee tribes that fought on the British side to lands west of the Mississippi River  Later  as president  Jefferson proposed in private letters beginning in 1803 a policy that under Andrew Jackson would be called Indian removal  under an act passed in 1830  111  112  As president  he made a deal with elected officials of the state of Georgia  if Georgia would release its legal claims to  discovery  in lands to its west  the U S  military would help expel the Cherokee people from Georgia  His deal violated an existing treaty between the United States government and the Cherokee Nation  which guaranteed its people the right to their historic lands  111  Jefferson believed that Natives should give up their own cultures  religions  and lifestyles to assimilate to western European culture  Christian religion  and a European style agriculture  which he believed to be superior  111  112  He believed that assimilation of Native Americans into the European American economy would make them more dependent on trade  and that they would eventually be willing to give up land that they would otherwise not part with  in exchange for trade goods or to resolve unpaid debts  113  In keeping with his trade and acculturation policy  Jefferson kept Benjamin Hawkins as Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Southeastern peoples  who became known as the Five Civilized Tribes for their adoption of European American ways  Jefferson believed assimilation was best for Native Americans  second best was removal to the west  He felt the worst outcome of the cultural and resources conflict between European Americans and Native Americans would be their attacking the whites  114  He told his Secretary of War  General Henry Dearborn  Indian affairs were then under the War Department    if we are constrained to lift the hatchet against any tribe  we will never lay it down until that tribe is exterminated  or driven beyond the Mississippi   115  With the colonial and native civilizations in collision  compounded by British incitement of Indian tribes and mounting hostilities between the two peoples  Jefferson s administration took quick measures to avert another major conflict  His deal with Georgia was related to later measures to relocate the various Indian tribes to points further west  111  1804 election and second term Further information  United States presidential election  1804 In his second term  Jefferson s popularity suffered because the problems he faced  most notably those caused by the wars in Europe  became more difficult to solve  During Jefferson s first term  Napoleon s position was relatively weak and as such negotiations were possible  After Napoleon s decisive victory at the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805  however  Napoleon became much more aggressive  and most United States attempts to negotiate with him were unsuccessful  Jefferson responded with the Embargo Act of 1807  directed also at Great Britain  This triggered economic chaos in the US and was strongly criticized at the time  as it continues to be  116  Due to political attacks against Jefferson  in particular those by Alexander Hamilton and his supporters  he used the Alien and Sedition Acts to counter some of these political adversaries  117  In 1807  Jefferson ordered his former vice president Aaron Burr tried for treason  Burr was charged with conspiring to levy war against the United States in an attempt to establish a separate confederacy composed of the Western states and territories  but he was acquitted  118  119  Due to protections under the US Constitution of 1787  the international slave trade had been protected for two decades  during which planters of the Lower South imported tens of thousands of slaves  more than during any other 20 year period  120  In December 1806 Jefferson had called on Congress to take action and in 1807  it passed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves  This was the earliest that the trade could be regulated  Jefferson signed and the law went into effect January 1  1808  121  While the act established severe punishment against the international trade  it did not regulate the domestic slave trade  Embargo Further information  Embargo Act of 1807 A political cartoon showing merchants dodging the  Ograbme   which is  Embargo  spelled backwards  1807  Jefferson encouraged passage of the Embargo Act in 1807 to maintain American neutrality in the Napoleonic Wars  Jefferson hoped to avoid national humiliation on the one hand  and war on the other  In the event  he got both war and national humiliation  the economy of the entire Northeast suffered severely  Jefferson was vehemently denounced  and his party lost support  Instead of retreating  Jefferson sent federal agents to secretly track down smugglers and violators  122  123  The embargo was a financial disaster because the Americans could not export  while widespread disregard of the law meant enforcement was difficult  For the most part  it effectively throttled American overseas trade  All areas of the United States suffered  In commercial New England and the Middle Atlantic states  ships rotted at the wharves  and in the agricultural areas  particularly in the South  farmers and planters could not export their crops  Jefferson s Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin was against the embargo  foreseeing correctly the impossibility of enforcing the policy and the negative public reaction   As to the hope that it may   induce England to treat us better   wrote Gallatin to Jefferson shortly after the bill had become law   I think is entirely groundless   government prohibitions do always more mischief than had been calculated  and it is not without much hesitation that a statesman should hazard to regulate the concerns of individuals as if he could do it better than themselves   124  Though he had so frequently argued for as small a federal government as possible  Jefferson required the national government to assume extraordinary police powers in an attempt to enforce his policy  The presidential election of 1808  which James Madison won  showed that the Federalists were regaining strength  and helped to convince Congress that the Embargo would have to be repealed  Shortly before leaving office  in March 1809  Jefferson signed the repeal of the disastrous Embargo  In its place the Nonintercourse Act was enacted  which proved no more effective than the Embargo  The government found it was impossible to prevent American vessels from trading with the European belligerents once they had left American ports  Jefferson increasingly believed the problem was the greedy traders and merchants who showed their lack of  republican virtue  by not complying  125  Historians have generally criticized Jefferson for his embargo policy  Cogliano notes that the failure of the Embargo  reinforced the view that Jefferson had been lucky rather than adroit during the earlier negotiations   126  Doron Ben Atar argued that Jefferson s commercial and foreign policies were misguided  ineffective and harmful to American interests  127  Kaplan argued that the War of 1812 was the logical extension of his embargo and that  by entering the Napoleonic Wars on anti British side  the United States gave up the advantages of neutrality  128  Kaplan adds   The results were a personal disaster for Jefferson and general malaise and confusion for the nation   129  Bradford Perkins concluded that on this issue  Jefferson was  a wavering  miscalculating  and self deluding man   130  Other involvements He obtained the repeal of some federal taxes in his bid to rely more on customs revenue  and dismantled much of the army and navy that he had inherited from Washington and Adams  He pardoned several people imprisoned under the Alien and Sedition Acts  passed in John Adams  term  He repealed the Judiciary Act of 1801  which removed nearly all of Adams   midnight judges  from office  This quickly led to the Supreme Court deciding the important case of Marbury v  Madison  This also repealed a provision in the act that freed supreme court justices from having to constantly travel the country to serve as circuit court judges  This provision wasn t reinstated for another century  and its repeal under Jefferson ensured that justices would continue to bear heavy travel burdens throughout the nineteenth century  Jefferson also signed into law a bill that officially segregated the US postal system by not allowing blacks to carry mail  131  Later years By 1815  Jefferson s library included 6 487 books  which he sold to the Library of Congress for  23 950 to replace the smaller collection destroyed in the War of 1812  He intended to pay off some of his large debt  but immediately started buying more books  56  In honor of Jefferson s contribution  the library s website for federal legislative information was named THOMAS  132  133  In 2007  Jefferson s two volume 1764 edition of the Quran was used by Rep  Keith Ellison for his swearing in to the House of Representatives  134  In February 2011 the New York Times reported that a part of Jefferson s retirement library  containing 74 volumes with 28 book titles  was discovered at Washington University in St  Louis  133  University of Virginia See also  University of Virginia The Rotunda  University of Virginia After leaving the Presidency  Jefferson continued to be active in public affairs  He wanted to found a new institution of higher learning  specifically one free of church influences  where students could specialize in many new areas not offered at other universities  Jefferson believed educating people was a good way to establish an organized society  He believed such schools should be paid for by the general public  so less wealthy people could be educated as students  135  A letter to Joseph Priestley  in January 1800  indicated that he had been planning the University for decades before its founding  In 1819 he founded the University of Virginia  Upon its opening in 1825  it was the first university to offer a full slate of elective courses to its students  One of the largest construction projects to that time in North America  the university was notable for being centered about a library rather than a church  No campus chapel was included in Jefferson s original plans  Until his death  Jefferson invited students and faculty of the college to his home  Jefferson is widely recognized by whom   for his planning of the University grounds  Its innovative design was an expression of his aspirations for both state sponsored education and an agrarian democracy in the new Republic  His educational idea of creating specialized units of learning is expressed in the configuration of his campus plan  which he called the  Academical Village   Individual academic units were defined as distinct structures  represented by Pavilions  facing a grassy quadrangle  Each Pavilion housed classroom  faculty office  and residences  Though distinctive  each is visually equal in importance  and they are linked with a series of open air arcades that are the front facades of student accommodations  Gardens and vegetable plots are placed behind and surrounded by serpentine walls  affirming the importance of the agrarian lifestyle  His highly ordered site plan establishes an ensemble of buildings surrounding a central rectangular quadrangle  named The Lawn  which is lined on either side with the academic teaching units and their linking arcades  The quad is enclosed at one end with the library  the repository of knowledge  at the head of the table  The remaining side opposite the library remained open ended for future growth  The lawn rises gradually as a series of stepped terraces  each a few feet higher than the last  rising up to the library set in the most prominent position at the top  while also suggesting that the Academical Village facilitates easier movement to the future  Stylistically  Jefferson was a proponent of the Greek and Roman styles  which he believed to be most representative of American democracy by historical association  Each academic unit is designed with a two story temple front facing the quadrangle  while the library is modeled on the Roman Pantheon  The ensemble of buildings surrounding the quad is an unmistakable architectural statement of the importance of secular public education  while the exclusion of religious structures reinforces the principle of separation of church and state  The campus planning and architectural treatment remains today as a paradigm of building of structures to express intellectual ideas and aspirations  A survey of members of the American Institute of Architects identified Jefferson s campus as the most significant work of architecture in America  The University was designed as the capstone of the educational system of Virginia  In his vision  any citizen of the state could attend school with the sole criterion being ability  136  137  Death Jefferson s gravesite Jefferson  health began to deteriorate by July 1825  and by June 1826 he was confined to bed  His death was from a combination of illnesses and conditions including uremia  severe diarrhea  and pneumonia  138  Jefferson died on July 4  1826  the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence  and a few hours before John Adams  Though born into a wealthy slave owning family  Jefferson had many financial problems  and died deeply in debt  139  He gave instructions for disposal of his assets in his Will 140  and after his death  his possessions  including 130 persons he held as slaves  were sold off in public auctions starting in 1827  139  Monticello was sold in 1831  Thomas Jefferson is buried in the family cemetery at Monticello  The cemetery is separately owned and operated by the Monticello Association  a lineage society that is not affiliated with the Thomas Jefferson Foundation that runs the estate as a public history site  Jefferson wrote his own epitaph  which reads  HERE WAS BURIED THOMAS JEFFERSON AUTHOR OF THE DECLARATION OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE OF THE STATUTE OF VIRGINIA FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND FATHER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA  Political philosophy and views See also  Jeffersonian democracy and Republicanism in the United States Jefferson idealized the independent yeoman as the best exemplar of republican virtues  distrusted cities and financiers  and favored states  rights and a strictly limited federal government  He suspended his qualms about exercising powers of federal

the Anglican Church in Virginia after the Revolution  and wrote the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom  1779  1786   citation needed  His Jeffersonian democracy and Democratic Republican Party became dominant in American politics  Jefferson s republican political principles were strongly influenced by the 18th century British opposition writers of the Country Party  He had high regard for John Locke  Francis Bacon  and Isaac Newton  141  Jefferson expressed a dislike and distrust for banks and bankers  he opposed borrowing from banks because he believed it created long term debt as well as monopolies  and inclined the people to dangerous speculation  as opposed to productive labor on the farm  142  Jefferson believed that each man has  certain inalienable rights   He defines the right of  liberty  by saying   Rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others     143  A proper government  for Jefferson  is one that not only prohibits individuals in society from infringing on the liberty of other individuals  but also restrains itself from diminishing individual liberty  citation needed  Society and government The historian Gordon S  Wood argues that Jefferson s political philosophy was a product of his time and his scientific interests  Influenced by Isaac Newton  he considered social systems as analogous to physical systems  144  In the social world  Jefferson likens love as a force similar to gravity in the physical world  People are naturally attracted to each other through love  but dependence corrupts this attraction and results in political problems  144  Wood argues that  though the phrase  all men are created equal  was a clich  in the late 18th century  144  Jefferson took it further than most  Jefferson held that not only are all men created equal  but they remain equal throughout their lives  equally capable of love as an attractive force  Their level of dependence makes them unequal in practice  Removing or preventing corrupting dependence would enable men to be equal in practice  144  Jefferson idealized a future in which men would be free of dependencies  particularly those caused by banking or royal influences  144  In his May 28  1818  letter to Mordecai Manuel Noah  Jefferson expressed his faith in humanity and his views on the nature of democracy  In political terms  Americans thought that virtue was the  glue  that held together a republic  whereas patronage  dependency and coercion held together a monarchy   Virtue  in this sense was public virtue  in particular self sacrifice  People commonly thought that any dependence would corrupt this impulse  by making people more subservient to their patrons than to society at large  This derived from the British conception of the nobility  whose economic independence allowed them to work and make personal sacrifices on behalf of the society at large  Americans reasoned that liberty and republicanism required a virtuous society  and the society had to be free of dependence and extensive patronage networks  144  Jefferson s ideal of the yeoman farmer  or a slave owning planter  personified his ideal of independence  While Jefferson believed most persons could not escape corrupting dependence  the franchise should be extended only to those who could  His fear of dependence and patronage made Jefferson dislike established institutions  such as banking  government  or military  He disliked inter generational dependence  as well as its manifestations  such as national debt and unalterable governments  For these reasons  he opposed Hamilton s consolidated banking and military plans  144  Wood argues that Hamilton favored his plans for the very reason that Jefferson feared them  because he believed that they would provide for future American greatness  Jefferson feared a loss of individual liberty for propertied individuals and did not desire imperial stature for the nation  144  During the late 1780s  James Madison grew to believe that self interested dependence could be filtered from a government  Jefferson  however  continued to idealize the yeoman farmer as the base for republican government  144  Whereas Madison became disillusioned with what he saw as excessive democracy in the states  Jefferson believed such excesses were caused by institutional corruptions rather than human nature  He remained less suspicious of working democracy than many of his contemporaries  144  Wood argues that as president  Jefferson tried to re create the balance between the states and federal government as it existed under the Articles of Confederation  He tried to shift the balance of power back to the states  Wood argues that Jefferson took this action from his classical republican conception that liberty could only be retained in small  homogeneous societies  He believed that the Federalist system enacted by Washington and Adams had encouraged corrupting patronage and dependence  144  According to Wood  many of Jefferson s apparent contradictions can be understood within this philosophical framework  For example  his intent to deny women the franchise was rooted in his belief that a government must be controlled by the independent  In the 18th century  men believed that women were dependent by their nature  In common with most political thinkers of his day  Jefferson did not support gender equality  He opposed women s participation in politics  saying that  our good ladies     are contented to soothe and calm the minds of their husbands returning ruffled from political debate   145  Democracy Jefferson is a major iconic figure in the emergence of democracy he was the  agrarian democrat  who shaped the thinking of his nation and the world  146  147  The historian Vernon Louis Parrington concluded in 1927   Far more completely than any other American of his generation he embodied the idealisms of the great revolution   its faith in human nature  its economic individualism  its conviction that here in America  through the instrumentality of political democracy  the lot of the common man should somehow be made better   148  Jefferson s concepts of democracy were rooted in The Enlightenment  as Peter Onuf has stressed  He envisioned democracy as an expression of society as a whole  and he called for national self determination  cultural uniformity  and education of all the people  or all the males  as he believed at the time   His emphasis on uniformity did not envision a multiracial republic in which some groups were not fully assimilated into the identical republican values  Onuf argues that Jefferson was unable and unwilling to abolish slavery until such a demand could issue naturally from the sensibilities of the entire people  149  Gordon Wood argues that Jefferson s philosophy of liberty personified American ideals  150  Jefferson believed that public education and a free press were essential to a democratic nation   If a nation expects to be ignorant and free it expects what never was and never will be    The people cannot be safe without information  Where the press is free  and every man able to read  all is safe   151  Foreign policy According to Tucker and Hendrickson  Jefferson believed America  was the bearer of a new diplomacy  founded on the confidence of a free and virtuous people  that would secure ends based on the natural and universal rights of man  by means that escaped war and its corruptions   citation needed  Jefferson sought a radical break from the traditional European emphasis on  reason of state   which could justify any action  and the traditional priority of foreign policy and the needs of the ruling family over the needs of the people  152  Jefferson envisaged America becoming the world s great  empire of liberty   that is  the model for democracy and republicanism  On departing the presidency in 1809  he described America as   Trusted with the destinies of this solitary republic of the world  the only monument of human rights  and the sole depository of the sacred fire of freedom and self government  from hence it is to be lighted up in other regions of the earth  if other regions of the earth shall ever become susceptible of its benign influence   153  In the decades after the Revolutionary War  he considered Britain as an enemy to the United States  because it was the base for a successful aristocracy and antipathy to democracy  while France  at least in the early stages of the French Revolution  appeared to be developing a solution to Europe s malaise  He said   The liberty of the whole world was depending on the issue of the contest   154  He never wanted war  The paradox was that as Britain was much more powerful and was the leading trading partner of the U S   Jefferson s economic warfare against resulted in hurting the American economy  155  Rebellion and individual rights After the Revolutionary War  Jefferson advocated restraining government via rebellion and violence when necessary  in order to protect individual freedoms  In a letter to James Madison on January 30  1787  Jefferson wrote   A little rebellion  now and then  is a good thing  and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical   It is a medicine necessary for the sound health of government   156  Similarly  in a letter to Abigail Adams on February 22  1787 he wrote   The spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions that I wish it to be always kept alive  It will often be exercised when wrong  but better so than not to be exercised at all   156  Concerning Shays  Rebellion after he had heard of the bloodshed  on November 13  1787 Jefferson wrote to William S  Smith  John Adams  son in law   What signify a few lives lost in a century or two  The tree of liberty must from time to time be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants  It is its natural manure   157  In another letter to Smith during 1787  Jefferson wrote   And what country can preserve its liberties  if the rulers are not warned from time to time  that this people preserve the spirit of resistance  Let them take arms   156  Slavery Main article  Thomas Jefferson and slavery Main article  History of Virginia A page from a record book listing the names of Jefferson s slaves over the years  They numbered roughly 600 in his lifetime  Jefferson lived in the  slave society  of Virginia and the South  where slavery was at  the center of economic production  and slaveholders comprised the ruling class  158  159  As an elite  slaveholders were limited in number and controlled the political power  Jefferson owned hundreds of slaves to work plantations totaling more than ten thousand acres 160  and relied on slavery to support his family s way of life  Notable for his idealistic words on the rights of man in the Declaration of Independence  Jefferson shared contemporary racial views that Africans were inferior to whites and needed supervision  This became his rationale for justifying slavery  although he had condemned the institution under his Enlightenment ideals  Jefferson opposed the international slave trade  In the Virginia Assembly  in the 1780s Jefferson gained passage of a bill to prohibit the state from importing slaves  This bill was passed in order to raise the value of domestic slaves  and there is no evidence that Jefferson or any Virginians wanted to abolish slavery  161  As president  on March 2  1807 he signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves which outlawed the slave trade in U S  and took effect January 1  1808  it had been protected for 20 years under compromises in the United States Constitution to satisfy southern slaveholders  162  While Jefferson has been long admired for his ideals related to the rights of man  since the late twentieth century  some historians have criticized him for failing to take actions after 1785 as a senior statesman to ameliorate or end slavery in the United States  and for not freeing his own slaves through use of the estate of Tadeusz Ko ciuszko  163  or at his death  During his life  Jefferson formally freed only two slaves in the 1790s  both mixed race sons of Betty Hemings  He freed all four surviving children of Sally Hemings as they came of age  two by letting them  walk away  in 1822 and two by his will  He missed an opportunity to free all of his slaves before his death at no cost to himself  His friend Tadeusz Ko ciuszko from the American Revolution  a Polish nobleman  collected his back pay in 1798 and entrusted it to Jefferson with a will directing him to spend his American estate on freeing black slaves  including Jefferson s own  163  164  Ko ciu zko died in 1817  but Jefferson never carried out his will  Some years after his death  Jefferson transferred the executorship to John Hartwell Cocke  who also failed to carry it out  In 1852 Chief Justice Roger Taney transferred the estate  by then worth more than  50 000  to Kosciu ko s heirs in Poland  163  Jefferson in his will of 1826 also freed three older male slaves who had served him for decades  all were related to Hemings  Jefferson had incurred great debt because of the low price of tobacco  his patterns of spending  and family problems  which he did not correct before his death  The remainder of his 130 slaves were sold after his death to settle the debts of the estate  The historian Edmund S  Morgan noted   Hemings herself was withheld from auction and freed at last by Jefferson s daughter  Martha Jefferson Randolph  who was  of course  her niece   164  Jefferson s views on slavery appeared to change throughout his life  Over the decades  historians have evaluated him in terms of his stated position on human rights  including the inspirational preamble to the Declaration of Independence  as well as holding him accountable for his actions or lack of actions to end or ameliorate slavery within the United States  Religion Further information  Thomas Jefferson and religion Jefferson rejected the orthodox Christianity of his day and was especially hostile to the Catholic Church as he saw it operate in France  Throughout his life Jefferson was intensely interested in theology  biblical study  and morality  As a landowner he played a role in governing his local Episcopal Church  in terms of belief he was inclined toward Deism and the moral philosophy of Christianity  In a private letter to Benjamin Rush  Jefferson refers to himself as  Christian   1803    To the corruptions of Christianity I am  indeed  opposed  but not to the genuine precepts of Jesus himself  I am a Christian  in the only sense in which he wished any one to be  sincerely attached to his doctrines  in preference to all others  ascribing to himself every human excellence     165  In a letter to his close friend William Short Jefferson clarified   it is not to be understood that I am with him  Jesus  in all his doctrines  I am a Materialist  he takes the side of Spiritualism  he preaches the efficacy of repentance toward forgiveness of sin  I require a counterpoise of good works to redeem it  Among the sayings and discourses imputed to him by his biographers  I find many passages of fine imagination  correct morality  and of the most lovely benevolence  and others  again  of so much ignorance  of so much absurdity  so much untruth and imposture  as to pronounce it impossible that such contradictions should have proceeded from the same being   166  Jefferson praised the morality of Jesus and edited a compilation of his teachings  omitting the miracles and supernatural elements of the biblical account  titling it  The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth   167  Jefferson was firmly anticlerical saying that in  every country and every age  the priest has been hostile to liberty  He is always in alliance with the despot   they have perverted the purest religion ever preached to man into mystery and jargon  unintelligible to all mankind  and therefore the safer for their purposes   168  Jefferson rejected the idea of immaterial beings and considered the idea of an immaterial Creator a heresy introduced into Christianity  In a letter to John Adams  Jefferson wrote that to  talk of immaterial existences is to talk of nothings        At what age of the Christian church this heresy of immaterialism  this masked atheism  crept in  I do not know  But a heresy it certainly is  Jesus taught nothing of it  He told us indeed that  God is a spirit   but he has not defined what a spirit is  nor said that it is not matter  And the ancient fathers generally  if not universally  held it to be matter  light and thin indeed  an etherial gas  but still matter   169  Interests  activities  inventions  and improvements Jefferson was a farmer  with a lifelong interest in mechanical innovations  new crops  soil conditions  his gardens  and scientific agricultural techniques  His main cash crop was tobacco  but its price was usually low and it was rarely profitable  He tried to achieve self sufficiency with wheat  vegetables  flax  corn  hogs  sheep  poultry and cattle to feed and clothe his family  slaves and white employees  but he had cash flow problems and was always in debt  170  171  Jefferson s portable writing desk  which he used when writing the Declaration of Independence Jefferson was an accomplished architect who helped popularize the Neo Palladian style in the United States  172  Jefferson was interested in birds and wine  and was a noted gourmet  Jefferson was a prolific writer  He learned Gaelic to translate Ossian  and sent to James Macpherson for the originals  173  Jefferson invented many small practical devices and improved contemporary inventions  These include the design for a revolving book stand to hold five volumes at once to be viewed by the reader  Another was the  Great Clock   powered by the Earth s gravitational pull on Revolutionary War cannonballs  Its chime on Monticello s roof could be heard as far as the University of Virginia  Louis Leschot  a machinist  aided Jefferson with the clock  Jefferson invented a 6 in  15 cm  long coded wooden cipher wheel  mounted on a metal spindle  to keep secure State Department messages while he was Secretary of State  The messages were scrambled and unscrambled by 26 alphabet letters on each circular segment of the wheel  He improved the moldboard plow and the polygraph  in collaboration with Charles Willson Peale  174  As Minister to France  Jefferson was impressed by France s military standardization program known as the Syst me Gribeauval  As president  he initiated a program at the Federal Armories to develop interchangeable parts for firearms  175  Although not realized in Jefferson s lifetime  the concept of interchangeable parts eventually led to modern industry and was a major factor in the United States  industrial power by the late 19th century  citation needed  Personal life Maria Cosway Main article  Maria Cosway During his time in Paris as Minister to France  in 1786 the widower Jefferson became attached to Maria Cosway  an English artist  musician and composer  She was a highly educated  married woman with whom he fell in love  They were close and had some relationship about which biographers have speculated  she became part of his intimate circle of friends  and they spent nearly each day together over a six week period  In 1786 when Cosway returned to London  Jefferson wrote a 4 000 word love letter to her  which has become well known as his  Dialogue of the Head vs  the Heart   176  After Jefferson left Paris  he and Cosway remained friends and had a lifelong correspondence  177  Each saved their letters from the other  60  Similarly  Jefferson kept at Monticello an engraving of Maria done by Luigi Schiavonetti  from a drawing by Richard Cosway  178  In turn  Cosway had Trumbull create a portrait of Jefferson which she kept  179  Jefferson Hemings controversy Main article  Jefferson Hemings controversy In 1802 the journalist James T  Callender reported that the widower Jefferson took as a concubine his mixed race slave  Sally Hemings  who was likely his wife s half sister   180  This was after Callender had been refused a postmaster appointment and threatened Jefferson  He said Hemings had a mixed race son named Thomas  and other children  180  The story was repeated by Federalist papers during a heated election campaign  Jefferson made no public comment at the time  Most historians interpret his 1805 cover letter to Robert Smith  Secretary of the Navy  as a denial alluding to a more full reply  which has been lost  181  The Jefferson family denied the rumors  his grandson s claim that Peter Carr  a nephew of Jefferson  was the father of Hemings  children was published by the historian James Parton in his 1874 biography of the president  Twentieth century biographers including Merrill Peterson and Dumas Malone adopted this account and rejected Jefferson s paternity  They ignored or attacked the 1873 memoir by Madison Hemings  a son of Sally Hemings  who claimed that Jefferson was the father of him and his three siblings  182  In 1997  Annette Gordon Reed published an analysis of the historiography  she noted historians had ignored facts that pointed to Jefferson s paternity  for instance  that Jefferson was at Monticello for each of Hemings  conceptions  183  A Y DNA study in 1998 of descendants of the Jefferson male line  Eston Hemings  and the Carr nephews showed no match between the Carrs and the Hemings descendant  Based on the match between the Jefferson male line and the Hemings descendant  184  the study team concluded that  together with historic evidence  the results suggested Jefferson was the father of Eston Hemings  185  The study found no match between descendants of Thomas Woodson and the Jefferson male line  but it identified paternal European ancestry  The Woodson family have had a tradition of descent from Hemings and Jefferson  184  Since then  major biographers such as Joseph Ellis and Andrew Burstein 186  have concluded that the widower Jefferson had a long relationship with Hemings  and fathered her six children  The Thomas Jefferson Foundation  TJF   which runs Monticello  conducted an independent historic review in 2000  as did the National Genealogical Society in 2001  both concluded that Jefferson was likely the father of all Hemings  children  187  188  Other historians  including those associated with the Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society  TJHS  Scholars Commission  2001   have argued the evidence is insufficient to conclude Jefferson s paternity  The TJHS report suggests that Randolph Jefferson  his younger brother  is a more likely candidate  and notes that 24 other Jefferson males lived in Virginia  with eight within 20 miles of Monticello   As Y DNA is passed nearly unchanged  any male Jeffersons could have matched the Hemings descendant   184  The TJHS suggested that Hemings may have had multiple partners  189  No such alternative partners had been proposed by historians before the DNA study results  190  186  In 2012 the Smithsonian Institution and the Thomas Jefferson Foundation collaborated on an exhibit  Slavery at Jefferson s Monticello  Paradox of Liberty  Presented at the National Museum of American History from 27 January to 14 October  it notes that evidence  strongly support s  the conclusion that Jefferson was the father of Sally Hemings  children   191  Memorials and honors Further information  List of places named for Thomas Jefferson Rudolph Evans  statue of Jefferson with excerpts from the Declaration of Independence to the right Jefferson has been memorialized in many ways  including buildings  sculptures  and currency  The Jefferson Memorial was dedicated in Washington  D C  on April 13  1943  the 200th anniversary of Jefferson s birth  The interior of the memorial includes a 19 foot  6 m  statue of Jefferson and engravings of passages from his writings  Most prominent are the words inscribed around the monument near the roof   I have sworn upon the altar of god eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man   192  During the New Deal era of the 1930s  Democrats honored Jefferson and Andrew Jackson as their party s founding fathers and continued inspiration  He was portrayed by them as the spokesman for democracy and the common man  193  President Franklin D  Roosevelt led the effort to gain approvals for his monument in Washington  Thomas Jefferson has been honored on U S  postage since the first Jefferson postage stamp was released in 1856  Jefferson was the second president to be featured on U S  Postage  194  His portrait appears on the U S   2 bill  nickel  and the  100 Series EE Savings Bond  and a Presidential Dollar which released into circulation on August 16  2007  195  His original tombstone  now a cenotaph  is located on the campus in the University of Missouri s Quadrangle  A life mask of Jefferson was created by John Henri Isaac Browere in the 1820s  196  Jefferson  together with George Washington  Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln  was chosen by sculptor Gutzon Borglum and approved by President Calvin Coolidge to be depicted in stone at the Mount Rushmore Memorial  197  Other memorials to Jefferson include the commissioning of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ship Thomas Jefferson in Norfolk  Virginia on July 8  2003  in commemoration of his establishment of a Survey of the Coast  the predecessor to NOAA s National Ocean Service  A bronze monument to Jefferson was erected in Jefferson Park  Chicago along Milwaukee Avenue in 2005  Historical reputation 1st Jefferson stamp Issue of 1856 Jefferson has often been seen as a major American icon of liberty  democracy and republicanism  198  Many have hailed him as one of the most articulate spokesmen of the American Revolution  and as a renaissance man who promoted science and scholarship  In past scholarly surveys he has often been rated among the top ten presidents  though historians have become increasingly critical of him in recent decades  199  200  Abraham Lincoln called Jefferson  the most distinguished politician in our history   201  citing him when articulating his own philosophy of liberty and equality in the battle against slavery 202  203  and using the natural rights precepts of the Declaration of Independence as his guide to a better Union  204  Addressing Nobel laureates  John F  Kennedy remarked   I think this is the most extraordinary collection of talent  of human knowledge  that has ever been gathered together at the White House  with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone   205  Recent historians  including his biographer Dumas Malone of the mid twentieth century and the historian Ron Chernow  have seen a more mixed picture  They have noted his views on race and slavery  his controversial tenure as governor of Virginia  his disloyalty under Washington and Adams  his sometimes extreme political writings  his advocacy of nullification and secession  his personal spending excesses  and his troubled second term as president  206   The historian Gordon S  Wood has noted how the views of Jefferson and the other founders have changed as the values of the modern age have changed  He argues that during the progressive era of the late 19th and early 20th century  when scholars saw revolutionary America as a struggle between  haves  and  have nots   Jefferson s reputation reached new heights as his presidency was seen as the final defeat of the moneyed classes  Wood argues that this predominated until the 1940s  when the progressive era view fell from favor  and Jefferson s reputation declined from its prior heights  As modern historians see slavery as a greater evil than the mercantilism that Jefferson s adversaries championed  Wood argues  Jefferson s legacy in recent decades has come under further scrutiny and criticism  207  Together with the Civil Rights Movement and widespread cultural changes reflecting new priorities  a new generation of historians have reassessed Jefferson and other early leaders of the republic  Historians such as Richard Drinnon and David Stannard noted Jefferson s harsh treatment of Native Americans  Some biographers and historians of the era  such as David Brion Davis  have been more concerned about the contrast between Jefferson s statements about the equality of men and his lack of action to end or ameliorate slavery  John Chester Miller  Paul Finkelman and Nicholas Magnis have noted that Jefferson opposed a biracial society  Jefferson s legacy as a champion of Enlightenment ideals has been challenged by modern historians  208  who find his continued ownership of hundreds of slaves at Monticello to be in conflict with his stated views on freedom and the equality of men  The historian Peter Onuf stated that  Jefferson s failure to address the problem of slavery generally and the situation of his own human chattel   is in itself the most damning possible commentary on his iconic standing as  apostle of freedom    citation needed  The historian Clarence E  Walker said that Jefferson rationalized being a slave owner and defender of freedom since he believed blacks were inferior and needed supervision  208  The academic consensus that Jefferson had a long term relationship with his slave Sally Hemings and a  shadow family  with her demonstrates that he was a man of his times  with deep contradictions  citation needed  Writings A Summary View of the Rights
