Captain America for Marvel Comics precursor Timely Comics in 1940  he included a young sidekick   The boy companion was simply named Bucky  after my friend Bucky Pierson  a star on our high school basketball team   Simon said in his autobiography  2  Following the character s debut in Captain America Comics  1  March 1941   Bucky Barnes appeared alongside the title star in virtually every story in that publication and other Timely series  and was additionally part of the all kid team the Young Allies  In the post war era  with the popularity of superheroes fading  Bucky appeared alongside team leader Captain America in the two published adventures of Timely Marvel s first superhero group  the All Winners Squad  in the unhyphenated All Winners Comics  19  amp  21  Fall Winter 1946  there was no issue  20   After Bucky was shot and seriously wounded in a 1948 Captain America story  he was succeeded by Captain America s girlfriend Betsy Ross  who became the superheroine Golden Girl  Captain America Comics ended with  75  Feb  1950   by which time the series had been titled Captain America s Weird Tales for two issues  with the finale a horror suspense anthology issue with no superheroes  Captain America and Bucky were both briefly revived  along with fellow Timely stars the Human Torch and the Sub Mariner  in the omnibus Young Men  24  Dec  1953   published by Marvel s 1950s iteration Atlas Comics  Bucky appeared alongside  Captain America  Commie Smasher    as the hero was cover billed  in stories published during the next year in Young Men and Men s Adventures  as well as in three issues of Captain America that continued the old numbering  Sales were poor  however  and the series was discontinued with Captain America  78  Sept  1954   Retroactive continuity  beginning with The Avengers  4  March 1964   established that the original Captain America and Bucky went missing near the end of WWII and were secretly replaced by then U S  President Harry S  Truman by successor heroes using those identities  Bucky appeared in very occasional flashbacks from the 1960s on  and co starred with Captain America in flashback WWII adventures in Tales of Suspense  63 71  March Nov  1965   His apparent death was depicted in flashback in The Avengers  56  Sept  1968   In 2005  series writer Ed Brubaker returned Bucky from his seeming death near the end of World War II  He additionally revealed that Barnes s official status as Captain America s sidekick was a cover up  and that Barnes began as a 16 year old operative trained to do things regular soldiers and the twenty something Captain America normally would not do  such as conduct covert assassinations  Bucky s death had been notable as one of the few comic book deaths that remained unreversed  An aphorism among comic book fans  known as the Bucky Clause  was that in comics   No one stays dead except Bucky  Jason Todd and Uncle Ben   3  However  all three were brought back to life in their respective universes in 2006  although Uncle Ben turned out to be an alternate Ben from another reality  Bucky s death has also been used to explain why the Marvel Universe has virtually no young sidekicks  as no responsible hero wants to endanger a minor in similar fashion  Stan Lee also disliked the plot device of kid sidekicks  saying in the 1970s that  One of my many pet peeves has always been the young teenage sidekick of the average superhero   4 Roger Stern and John Byrne had also considered bringing Bucky back  before deciding against it  5  However  in 1990  co creator Jack Kirby  when asked if he had ever heard talk of resurrecting Bucky  answered   Speaking completely for myself  I wouldn t mind bringing Bucky in  he represents teenagers  and there are always teenagers  he s a universal character   6  A climactic scene of Bucky s return involves Captain America using the reality altering Cosmic Cube to restore the Winter Soldier s memories  Writer Ed Brubaker  in an interview  said he intended no loophole  and that Captain America did not  will  the Winter Soldier to have Bucky s memories  7   edit  Fictional character biography  edit  Origin and World War II James Barnes  named

with the ins and outs of military life  even though he is a teenager  It was at Lehigh that he meets and befriends Private Steven Rogers  who by all appearances is the clumsiest soldier in the camp  This was at the same time that reports of the then mysterious Captain America begin to appear in news magazines  and Barnes eagerly devours the accounts of this new hero  In 1940  Bucky accidentally walked in on Rogers changing into his uniform  thus discovering his friend was Captain America and insisted that he join him  He underwent extensive training and was assigned to be Captain America s partner  The military justified putting a 15 year old in harm s way by using him as a symbol to rally the youth of America  as revealed in Captain America vol  5   12  Dec 2005   They fight the Red

think you are   Or   Be Bucky   It was very straightforward  Which is more the tragedy  since Bucky immediately has this immense guilt for everything he did as the Winter Soldier      Captain America
