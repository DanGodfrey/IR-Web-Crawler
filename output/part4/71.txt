of Texas 4  5  and the ninth largest in the United States  The Dallas Fort Worth metroplex is the largest metropolitan area in the South and fourth largest metropolitan area in the United States  6  7  8  Divided between Collin  Dallas  Denton  Kaufman  and Rockwall counties  the city had a population of 1 197 816 in 2010  according to the United States Census Bureau  9  The city is the largest economic center of the 12 county Dallas Fort Worth Arlington metropolitan area  the DFW MSA  that according to the March 2010 U S  Census Bureau release  had a population of 6 371 773  10  The metroplex economy is the sixth largest in the United States  with a 2010 gross metropolitan product of  374 billion  11  Dallas was founded in 1841 and was formally incorporated as a city in February 1856  The city s economy is primarily based on banking  commerce  telecommunications  computer technology  energy  healthcare and medical research  transportation and logistics  The city is home to the third largest concentration of Fortune 500 companies in the nation  12  Located in North Texas and a major city in the American South  Dallas is the main core of the largest inland metropolitan area in the United States that lacks any navigable link to the sea  13  The city s prominence arose from its historical importance as a center for the oil and cotton industries  and its position along numerous railroad lines  With the advent of the interstate highway system in the 1950s and 1960s  Dallas became an east west and north south focal point of the interstate system with the convergence of four major interstate highways in the city  along with a fifth interstate loop around the city  Dallas developed a strong industrial and financial sector  and a major inland port  due largely to the presence of Dallas Fort Worth International Airport  one of the largest and busiest airports in the world  14  In the latest rankings released on September 14  2011  Dallas was rated as an Alpha  world city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group  amp  Network and is the only city in the South Central and Southwest regions to achieve that status  Dallas is also ranked 14th in world

century as a part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain by the Spanish Empire  the Dallas area was inhabited by the Caddo people  Later  France also claimed the area  but in 1819 the Adams On s Treaty made the Red River the northern boundary of New Spain  officially placing the future location of Dallas well within Spanish territory  16  The area remained under Spanish rule until 1821  when Mexico declared independence from Spain and the area became part of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas  In 1836  the Republic of Texas broke off from Mexico to become an independent nation  17  In 1839  Warren Angus Ferris surveyed the area around present day Dallas  Two and a half years later  John Neely Bryan established a permanent settlement near a river he found and called that settlement Dallas  The Republic of Texas was then annexed by the United States in 1845 and Dallas County was established the following year  Dallas was formally incorporated as a city in February 1856  The name of the city has uncertain origins  See History of Dallas  Texas  1839 1855  for more information on that   edit  Geography Dallas is the county seat of Dallas County  Portions of the city extend into neighboring Collin  Denton  Kaufman  and Rockwall counties  According to the United States Census Bureau  the city has a total area of 385 8 square miles  999 3 km2   340 5 square miles  881 9 km2  of it being land and 45 3 square miles  117 4 km2  of it  11 75   water  18  Dallas makes up one fifth of the much larger urbanized area known as the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex  in which one quarter of all Texans live   edit  Topography Main article  Geology of the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex Dallas and its surrounding area are mostly flat  the city itself lies at elevations ranging from 450 feet  137 m  to 550 feet  168 m   The western edge of the Austin Chalk Formation  a limestone escarpment  also known as the  White Rock Escarpment    rises 200 feet  61 m  and runs roughly north south through Dallas County  South of the Trinity River  the uplift is particularly noticeable in the neighborhoods of Oak Cliff and the adjacent cities of Cockrell Hill  Cedar Hill  Grand Prairie  and Irving  Marked variations in terrain are also found in cities immediately to the west in Tarrant County surrounding Fort Worth  as well as along Turtle Creek north of Downtown  Dallas  like many other cities in the world  was founded along a river  The city was founded at the location of a  white rock crossing  of the Trinity River  where it was easier for wagons to cross the river in the days before ferries or bridges  The Trinity River  though not usefully navigable  is the major waterway through the city  Its path through Dallas is paralleled by Interstate 35E along the Stemmons Corridor  then south alongside the western portion of Downtown and past south Dallas and Pleasant Grove  where the river is paralleled by Interstate 45 until it exits the city and heads southeast towards Houston  The river is flanked on both sides by 50 feet  15 m  tall earthen levees to protect the city from frequent floods  19  Since it was rerouted in 1908  the river has been little more than a drainage ditch within a floodplain for several miles above and below downtown Dallas  with a more normal course further upstream and downstream  but as Dallas began shifting towards postindustrial society  public outcry about the lack of aesthetic and recreational use of the river ultimately gave way to the Trinity River Project  20  which was initialized in the early 2000s and is scheduled to be completed in the 2010s  If the project materializes fully  it promises improvements to the riverfront in the form of man made lakes  new park facilities and trails  and transportation upgrades  The project area will reach for over 20 miles  32 km  in length within the city  while the overall geographical land area addressed by the Land Use Plan is approximately 44 000 acres  180 km2  in size about 20  of the land area in Dallas  Green space along the river will encompass approximately 10 000 acres  40 km2   making it one of the largest and diverse urban parks in the world  21  White Rock Lake  a reservoir constructed at the beginning of the 20th century  is Dallas  other significant water feature  The lake and surrounding park is a popular destination for boaters  rowers  joggers  and bikers  as well as visitors seeking peaceful respite from the city at the 66 acre  267 000 m2  Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden  located on the lake s eastern shore  White Rock Creek feeds into White Rock Lake  and then exits on to the Trinity River southeast of downtown Dallas  Trails along White Rock Creek are part of the extensive Dallas County Trails System  Bachman Lake  just northwest of Love Field Airport  is a smaller lake also popularly used for recreation  Northeast of the city is Lake Ray Hubbard  a vast 22 745 acre  92 km2  reservoir located in an extension of Dallas surrounded by the suburbs of Garland  Rowlett  Rockwall  and Sunnyvale  22  To the west of the city is Mountain Creek Lake  once home to the Naval Air Station Dallas  Hensley Field  and a number of defense aircraft manufacturers  23 North Lake  a small body of water in an extension of the city limits surrounded by Irving and Coppell  initially served as a water source for a nearby power plant but is now being targeted for redevelopment as a recreational lake due to its proximity to Dallas Fort Worth International Airport  a plan that the lake s neighboring cities oppose  24   edit  Climate Main article  Climate of Dallas A March photograph from Oak Cliff park Dallas has a humid subtropical climate  though it is located in a region that also tends to receive warm  dry winds from the north and west in the summer  bringing temperatures well over 100  F  38  C  at times and heat humidity indexes soaring to as high as 117  F  47  C   When only temperature itself is accounted for  the north central Texas region where Dallas is located is one of the hottest in the United States during the summer months  usually trailing only the Mojave Desert basin of Arizona  southern Nevada  and southeastern California  Winters in Dallas are generally mild  with normal daytime highs ranging from 55  F  13  C  to 70  F  21  C  and normal nighttime lows falling in between 30  F   1  C  and 45  F  7  C   A day with clear  sunny skies  a high of 63  F  17  C   and a low of 36  F  2  C  would thus be a very typical one during the winter  However  strong cold fronts known as  Blue Northers  sometimes pass through the Dallas region  plummeting nightly lows below 25  F   4  C  for up to a few days at a time and keeping daytime highs in a struggle to surpass 40  F  4  C   Snow accumulation is usually seen in the city at least once every winter  and snowfall generally occurs 1 2 days out of the year for an annual average of 1 7 inches  4 3 cm   Some areas in the region  however  receive more than that  while other areas receive negligible snowfall or none at all  25  A couple of times each winter in Dallas  warm and humid air from the south will override cold  dry air  resulting in freezing rain or ice and causing disruptions in the city if the roads and highways become slick  On the other hand  daytime highs above 70  F  21  C  are not unusual and will occur at least several days each winter month roughly the same number of days each December  January  and February that low temperatures fall below 30  F   1  C  or that high temperatures fail to reach 50  F  10  C   Over the past 15 years  Dallas has averaged 31 annual nights at or below freezing  with the winter of 1999 2000 holding the all time record as having the fewest freezing nights  with 14  During this same span of 15 years  the temperature in the region has only twice dropped below 15  F   9  C   though it will generally fall below 20  F   7  C  about once every other year  26  In sum  extremes and variations in winter weather are more readily seen in Dallas and Texas as a whole than along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts  due to the state s location in the interior of the North American continent and the lack of any mountainous terrain to the north to block out Arctic weather systems  Spring and autumn bring pleasant weather to the area  Vibrant wildflowers  such as the bluebonnet  Indian paintbrush and other flora  bloom in spring and are planted around the highways throughout Texas  27  Springtime weather can be quite volatile  but temperatures themselves are mild  The weather in Dallas is also generally pleasant from late September to early December and on many winter days  but unlike in the springtime  major storms rarely form in the area  Snow on the campus of Southern Methodist University in nearby University Park Each spring  cool fronts moving south from the North will collide with warm  humid air streaming in from the Gulf Coast  leading to severe thunderstorms with lightning  torrents of rain  hail  and occasionally  tornadoes  Over time  tornadoes have probably been the biggest natural threat to the city  as it is located near the heart of Tornado Alley  The U S  Department of Agriculture places Dallas in Plant Hardiness Zone 8a  28  29  However  mild winter temperatures in the past 15 to 20 years have encouraged the horticulture of some cold sensitive plants such as Washingtonia filifera and Washingtonia robusta palms  According to the American Lung Association  Dallas has the 12th highest air pollution among U S  cities  ranking it behind Los Angeles and Houston  30  Much of the air pollution in Dallas and the surrounding area comes from a hazardous materials incineration plant in the small town of Midlothian and from concrete installations in neighbouring Ellis County  31  The city s all time recorded low temperature is  8  F   22  C   set on February 12  1899  while the all time recorded high is 113  F  45  C   set on June 26 and 27  1980  32  The average daily low in Dallas is 57 1  F  13 9  C   and the average daily high in Dallas is 76 7  F  24 8  C   Dallas receives approximately 37 1 inches  942 3 mm  of rain
