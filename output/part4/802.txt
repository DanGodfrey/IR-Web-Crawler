horseback  Cavalry were historically the third oldest  after infantry and chariotry  and the most mobile of the combat arms  A soldier in the cavalry is known by a number of designations such as cavalryman  horseman or trooper  The designation of cavalry was not usually given to any military force that used other animals  such as camels or mules  Infantry who moved on horseback  but dismounted to fight on foot  were known in the 17th and early 18th centuries as dragoons  a class of mounted infantry which later evolved into cavalry proper while retaining their historic title  From earliest times cavalry had the advantage of improved mobility  making it an  instrument which multiplied the fighting value of even the smallest forces  allowing them to outflank and avoid  to surprise and overpower  to retreat and escape according to the requirements of the moment   1  A man fighting from horseback also had the advantages of greater height  speed  and inertial mass over an opponent on foot  Another element of horse mounted warfare is the psychological impact a mounted soldier can inflict on an opponent  The mobility and shock value of the cavalry was greatly appreciated and exploited in armed forces in the Ancient and Middle Ages  some forces were mostly cavalry  particularly in nomadic societies of Asia  notably the Mongol armies  In Europe cavalry became increasingly armoured  heavy   and eventually became known for the mounted knights  During the 17th century cavalry in Europe lost most of its armor  ineffective against the muskets and cannon which were coming into use  and by the mid 19th century armor had mainly fallen into disuse  with some regiments retained a small thickened cuirass that offered protection against lances and sabres and some protection against shot  In the period between the World Wars many cavalry units were converted into motorised infantry and mechanised infantry units  or reformed as tank troops  However some cavalry still served during the Second World War  notably in the Red Army  Italian Royal Army and the Polish Army  Most cavalry units that are horse mounted in modern armies serve in purely ceremonial roles  or as mounted infantry in difficult terrain such as mountains or heavily forested areas  Contents 1 Role of cavalry 2 History 2 1 Origins 2 2 Ancient Greece  city states  Thebes  Thessaly and

mounted soldier  c 1820 In many modern armies  the term cavalry is still often used to refer to units that are a combat arm of the armed forces which in the past filled the traditional horse borne land combat light cavalry roles  These include scouting  skirmishing with enemy reconnaissance elements to deny them knowledge of own disposition of troops  forward security  offensive reconnaissance by combat  defensive screening of friendly forces during retrograde movement  retreat  restoration of command and control  deception  battle handover and passage of lines  relief in place  linkup  breakout operations  and raiding  The shock role  traditionally filled by heavy cavalry  is generally filled by units with the  armored  designation   edit  History Assyrian cavalry  edit  Origins Before the Iron Age  the role of cavalry on the battlefield was largely performed by light chariots  The chariot originated with the Sintashta Petrovka culture in Central Asia and spread by nomadic or semi nomadic Indo Iranians  2  The chariot was quickly adopted by settled peoples both as a military technology and an object of ceremonial status  especially by the Pharaohs of the New Kingdom of Egypt as well as Assyrian and Babylonian royalty  The power of mobility given by mounted units was recognized early on  but was offset by the difficulty of raising large forces and by the inability of horses  then mostly small  to carry heavy armor  Cavalry techniques were an innovation of equestrian nomads of the Central Asian and Iranian steppe and pastoralist tribes such as the Persian Parthians and Sarmatians  The photograph above right shows Assyrian cavalry from reliefs of 865 860 BC  At this time  the men had no spurs  saddles  saddle cloths  or stirrups  Fighting from the back of a horse was much more difficult than mere riding  The cavalry acted in pairs  the reins of the mounted archer were controlled by his neighbour s hand  Even at this early time  cavalry used swords  shields  and bows  The sculpture implies two types of cavalry  but this might be a simplification by the artist  Later images of Assyrian cavalry show saddle cloths as primitive saddles  allowing each archer to control his own horse  As early as 490 BC a breed of large horses was bred in the Nisaean plain in Media to carry men with increasing amounts of armour  Herodotus 7 40  amp  9 20   But large horses were still very exceptional at this time  Excepting a few ineffective trials of scythed chariots  the use of chariots in battle was obsolete in civilized nations by the time of the Persian defeat at the hands of Alexander the Great  but chariots remained in use for ceremonial purposes such as carrying the victorious general in a Roman triumph  or for racing  The southern Britons met Julius Caesar with chariots in 55 and 54 BC  but by the time of the Roman conquest of Britain a century later chariots were obsolete even in Britannia   edit  Ancient Greece  city states  Thebes  Thessaly and Macedonia Warrior s departure  an Athenian amphora dated 550 540 BC  Main articles  hippeis and companion cavalry During the classical Greek period cavalry were usually limited to those citizens who could afford expensive war horses  Three types of cavalry became common  light cavalry  whose riders  armed with javelins  could harass and skirmish  heavy cavalry  whose troopers  using lances  had the ability to close with their opponents  and finally those whose equipment allowed them to fight either on horseback or foot  The role of horsemen did however remain secondary to that of the hoplites or heavy infantry who comprised the main strength of the citizen levies of the various city states  Cavalry played a relatively minor role in ancient Greek city states  with conflicts decided by massed armored infantry  However  Thebes produced Pelopidas  her first great cavalry commander  whose tactics and skills were absorbed by Phillip II of Macedon when Phillip was a guest hostage in Thebes  Thessaly was widely known for producing competent cavalrymen  and later experiences in wars both with and against the Persians taught the Greeks the value of cavalry in skirmishing and pursuit  The Athenian author and soldier Xenophon in particular advocated the creation of a small but well trained cavalry force  to that end  he wrote several manuals on horsemanship and cavalry operations  The Macedonian Kingdom in the north  on the other hand  developed a strong cavalry force that culminated in the hetairoi  Companion cavalry  of Philip II and Alexander the Great  In addition to these heavy cavalry  the Macedonian army also employed lighter horsemen called prodromoi for scouting and screening  as well as the Macedonian pike phalanx and various kinds of light infantry  There were also the Ippiko  or  Horserider    Greek  heavy  cavalry  armed with kontos  or cavalry lance   and sword  These wore leather armour or mail plus a helmet  They were medium rather than heavy cavalry  meaning that they were better suited to be scouts  skirmishers  and pursuers rather than front line fighters  This combination of cavalry and infantry helped to break enemy lines and were used effectively to dominate the opponents of the Macedonian Kingdom  The effectiveness of this combined arms system was most dramatically demonstrated in Alexander s conquest of Persia  Bactria  and northwestern India   edit  Roman Republic and Early Empire Main article  Roman cavalry Tombstone of a Roman auxiliary trooper from Cologne  Germany  Second half 1st C  AD The cavalry in the early Roman Republic remained the preserve of the wealthy landed class known as the equites men who could afford the expense of maintaining a horse in addition to arms and armor heavier than those of the common legions  As the class grew to be more of a social elite instead of a functional property based military grouping  the Romans began to employ Italian socii for filling the ranks of their cavalry  At about the same time the Romans began to recruit foreign auxiliary cavalry from among Gauls  Iberians  and Numidians  the last being highly valued as mounted skirmishers and scouts  see Numidian cavalry   Julius Caesar himself was known for his admiration of his escort of Germanic mixed cavalry  giving rise to the Cohortae Equitates  Early emperors maintained an ala of Batavian cavalry as their bodyguards until the unit was dismissed by Galba after the Batavian Rebellion  For the most part  Roman cavalry during the Republic functioned as an adjunct to the legionary infantry and formed only one fifth of the showing force  This does not mean that its utility could be underestimated  though  as its strategic role in scouting  skirmishing  and outpost duties was crucial to the Romans  capability to conduct operations over long distances in hostile or unfamiliar territory  In some occasions it also proved its ability to strike a decisive tactical blow against a weakened or unprepared enemy  such as the final charge at the Battle of Aquilonia  After defeats such as the Battle of Carrhae  the Romans learned the importance of large cavalry formations from the Parthians  They would begin to substantially increase both the numbers and the training standards of the cavalry in their employ  just as nearly a thousand years earlier the first Iranians to reach the Iranian Plateau forced the Assyrians to a similar reform  Nonetheless  they would continue to rely mainly on their heavy infantry supported by auxiliary cavalry  Reenactor as a Roman auxiliary cavalryman   edit  Late Roman Empire and the Migration Period In the army of the late Roman Empire  cavalry played an increasingly important role  The Spatha  the classical sword throughout most of the 1st millennium was adopted as the standard model for the Empire s cavalry forces  The most widespread employment of heavy cavalry at this time was found in the forces of the Parthians and their Iranian Sassanid successors  Both  but especially the former  were famed for the cataphract  fully armored cavalry armed with lances  even though the majority of their forces consisted of lighter horse archers  The West first encountered this eastern heavy cavalry during the Hellenistic period with further intensive contacts during the eight centuries of the Roman Persian wars  At first the Parthians  mobility greatly confounded the Romans  whose armoured close order infantry proved unable to match the speed of the Parthians  However  later the Romans would successfully adapt such heavy armor and cavalry tactics by creating their own units of cataphracts and clibanarii  3  The decline of the Roman infrastructure made it more difficult to field large infantry forces  and during the 4th and 5th centuries cavalry began to take a more dominant role on the European battlefield  also in part made possible by the appearance of new  larger breeds of horses  The replacement of the Roman saddle by variants on the Scythian model  with pommel and cantle  4  was also a significant factor as was the adoption of stirrups and the concomitant increase in stability of the rider s seat  Armored Cataphracts began to be deployed in eastern Europe and the near East  following the precedents established by Persian forces  as the main striking force of the armies in contrast to the earlier roles of cavalry as scouts  raiders  and outflankers  The late Roman cavalry tradition and the mounted nobility of the Germanic invaders both contributed to the development of mediaeval knightly cavalry   edit  Arabs Main article  Mobile guard A Moroccan with his Arabian horse along the Barbary coast  Arab camel cavalry Early organized Arab cavalry under the Rashidun caliphate was a light cavalry armed with lance and sword  its main role was to attack the enemy flanks and rear  Armor was relatively light  The Muslims  light cavalry during the later years of Islamic conquest of Levant became the most powerful section of army  The best use of this lightly armed fast moving cavalry was revealed at the Battle of Yarmouk  636 AD  in which Khalid ibn Walid  knowing the importance and ability of his cavalry  used them to turn the tables at every critical instance of the battle with their ability to engage and disengage and turn back and attack again from the flank or rear  A strong cavalry regiment was formed by Khalid ibn Walid which included the veterans of the campaign of Iraq and Syria  Early Muslim historians have given it the name Mutaharrik tulai a                 or the Mobile guard  This was used as an advance guard and a strong striking force to route the opposing armies with its greater mobility that give it an upper hand when maneuvering against any Byzantine army  With this mobile striking force  the conquest of Syria was made easy  5  A Mamluk cavalryman The Battle of Talas in 751 CE was a conflict between the Arab Abbasid Caliphate and the Chinese Tang Dynasty over the control of Central Asia  Chinese infantry were routed by Arab cavalry near the bank of the River Talas  Later Mamluks were trained as cavalry soldiers  Mamluks were to follow the dictates of al furusiyya  6  a code of conduct that included values like courage and generosity but also doctrine of cavalry tactics  horsemanship  archery and treatment of wounds   edit  Asia Main article  Horse archer  edit  Central Asia Xiongnu or Hun  Tujue  Avars  Kipchaks  Mongols  Cossacks and the various Turkic peoples are also examples of the horse mounted peoples that managed to gain substantial successes in military conflicts with settled agrarian and urban societies  due to their strategic and tactical mobility  As European states began to assume the character of bureaucratic nation states supporting professional standing armies  recruitment of these mounted warriors was undertaken in order to fill the strategic roles of scouts and raiders  The best known instance of the continued employment of mounted tribal auxiliaries were the Cossack cavalry regiments of Tsarist Russia  In eastern Europe  Russia  and out onto the steppes  cavalry remained important much longer and dominated the scene of warfare until the early 17th century and even beyond  as the strategic mobility of cavalry was crucial for the semi nomadic pastoralist lives that many steppe cultures led  7  Tibetans also had a tradition of cavalry warfare  in several military engagements early on with the Chinese Tang Dynasty  618 907 AD   including Emperor Taizong s campaign against Tufan in 638   edit  East Asia The Mongol cavalry pursuing their enemy  In the Battle of Ichi no Tani  Japanese cavalry moving down a mountain side  A bas relief of a soldier and horse with saddle and stirrups  from the tomb of Chinese Emperor Taizong of Tang  r  626 649   c  650 Further east  the military history of China  specifically northern China  held a long tradition of intense military exchange between Han Chinese infantry forces of the settled dynastic empires and the mounted nomads or  barbarians  of the north  The naval history of China was centered more to the south  where mountains  rivers  and large lakes necessitated the employment of a large and well kept navy  In 307 BC  King Wuling of Zhao  the ancient Chinese ruler of the former State of Jin territory  ordered his military commanders and troops to adopt the trousers of the nomads as well as practice the nomads  form of mounted archery to hone their new cavalry skills  8  Soon afterwards the cavalry tactics employed by the State of Zhao forced their enemies in the other Warring States to adopt the same techniques in order to mount any effective attack against their swift movements on the battlefield  9  The adoption of massed cavalry in China also broke the tradition of the chariot riding Chinese aristocracy in battle  which had been in use since the ancient Shang Dynasty  c  1600 BC 1050 BC   10  By this time large Chinese infantry based armies of 100 000 to 200 000 troops were now buttressed with several hundred thousand mounted cavalry in support or as an effective striking force  9  The handheld pistol and trigger crossbow was invented in China in the 4th century BC  11  it was written by the Song Dynasty scholars Zeng Gongliang  Ding Du  and Yang Weide in their book Wujing Zongyao  1044 AD  that massed missile fire by crossbowmen was the most effective defense against enemy cavalry charges  12  The Qianlong Emperor in ceremonial armor on horseback  painted by Giuseppe Castiglione  dated 1739 or 1758  On many occasions the Chinese studied nomadic cavalry tactics and applied the lessons in creating their own potent cavalry forces  while in others they simply recruited the tribal horsemen wholesale into their armies  and in yet other cases nomadic empires proved eager to enlist Chinese infantry and engineering  as in the case of the Mongol Empire and its sinicized part  the Yuan Dynasty  1279 1368   The Chinese recognized early on during the Han Dynasty  202 BC 220 AD  that they were at a disadvantage in lacking the number of horses the northern nomadic peoples mustered in their armies  Emperor Wu of Han  r  141 BC 87 BC  went to war with the Dayuan for this reason  since the Dayuan were hording a massive amount of tall  strong  Central Asian bred horses in the Hellenized Greek region of Fergana  established slightly earlier by Alexander the Great   Although experiencing some defeats early on in the campaign  Emperor Wu s war from 104 BC to 102 BC succeeded in gathering the prized tribute of horses from Fergana  Cavalry tactics in China were enhanced by the invention of the saddle attached stirrup by at least the 4th century  as the oldest reliable depiction of a rider with paired stirrups was found in a Jin Dynasty tomb of the year 322 AD  13  14  15  The Chinese invention of the horse collar by the 5th century was also a great improvement from the breast harness  allowing the horse to haul greater weight without heavy burden on its skeletal structure  16  17  The horse warfare of Korea was first started during the ancient Korean kingdom Gojoseon  Since at least the 3rd century BC  there was influence of northern nomadic peoples and Yemaek peoples on Korean Warfare  By roughly the 1st century BC  the ancient kingdom of Buyeo also had mounted warriors  18  The cavalry of Goguryeo  one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea  were called Gaemamusa               King Gwanggaeto the Great often led expeditions into the Baekje  Gaya confederacy  Buyeo  Later Yan and against Japanese invaders with his cavalry  19  In the 12 century  Jurchen tribes began to violate the Goryeo Jurchen borders  and eventually invaded Goryeo Korea  After experiencing the invasion by the Jurchen  Korean general Yun Gwan realized that Goryeo lacked efficient cavalry units  He reorganized the Goryeo military into a professional army that would contain decent and well trained cavalry units  In 1107  the Jurchen were ultimately defeated  and surrendered to Yun Gwan  To mark the victory  General Yun built nine fortresses to the northeast of the Goryeo Jurchen borders     9           The ancient Japanese of the Kofun period also adopted cavalry and equine culture by the 5th century AD   edit  South Asia In the Indian subcontinent  cavalry played a major role from the Gupta Dynasty  320 600  period onwards  India has also the oldest evidence for the introduction of toe stirrups  citation needed  Indian literature contains numerous references to the cavalry forces of the Central Asian horse nomads like the Sakas  Kambojas  Yavanas  Pahlavas and Paradas  Numerous Puranic texts refer to a conflict in ancient India  16th c

requisitioned in ancient wars  V  R  Ramachandra Dikshitar writes   Both the Puranas and the epics agree that the horses of the Sindhu and Kamboja regions were of the finest breed  and that the services of the Kambojas as cavalry troopers were requisitioned in ancient wars    22  J A O S  writes   Most famous horses are said to come either from Sindhu or Kamboja  of the latter  i e the Kamboja   the Indian epic Mahabharata speaks among the finest horsemen    23  Mahabharata  950 c BC  24  speaks of the esteemed cavalry of the Kambojas  Sakas  Yavanas and Tusharas  all of whom had participated in the Kurukshetra war under the supreme command of Kamboja ruler Sudakshin Kamboj  25  Mahabharata and Vishnudharmotari Purana especially styles the Kambojas  Yavansa  Gandharas etc  as

with 30 000 infantry  20 000 cavalry and 30 war elephants  33  Scholars have identified the Assakenoi and Aspasioi clans of Kunar and Swat valleys as a section of the Kambojas  34  These hardy tribes had offered stubborn resistance to Alexander  326 c BC  during latter s campaign of the Kabul  Kunar and Swat valleys and had even extracted the praise of the Alexander s historians  These highlanders  designated as  parvatiya Ayudhajivinah  in P  ini s Astadhyayi  35  were rebellious  fiercely independent and freedom loving cavalrymen who never easily yielded to any overlord  36  The Sanskrit

43  Ancient Kambojas were constituted into military Sanghas and Srenis  Corporations  to manage their political and military affairs  as Arthashastra of Kautiliya as well as the Mahabharata amply attest for us  They are attested to be living as Ayuddha jivi or Shastr opajivis  Nation in arms   which also means that the Kamboja cavalry offered its military services to other nations as well  There are numerous references to Kambojas having been requisitioned as cavalry troopers in ancient wars by outside nations   edit  European Middle Ages See also  Horses in the Middle Ages Horse mounted Normans fighting in the Bayeux Tapestry  11th century  Although Roman cavalry had no stirrups  their horned saddle allowed the combination of a firm seat with substantial flexibility  But the introduction of the wraparound saddle during the Middle Ages provided greater efficiency in mounted shock combat and the important invention of the stirrup enabled a broader array of attacks to be delivered from the back of a horse  As a greater weight of man and armor could be supported in the saddle  the probability of being dismounted in combat was significantly reduced  In particular  a charge with the lance couched under the armpit would no longer turn into pole vaulting  this eventually led to an enormous increase in the impact of the charge  Last but not least  the introduction of spurs allowed better control of the mount during the  knightly charge  in full gallop  In western Europe there emerged what is considered the  ultimate  heavy cavalry  the knight  The knights and other similarly equipped mounted men at arms charged in close formation  exchanging flexibility for a massive  irresistible first charge  A 13th century depiction of a riding horse  Note resemblance to the modern Paso Fino  A Hussite war wagon  it enabled peasants to defeat knights The mounted men at arms quickly became an important force in Western European tactics  Medieval military doctrine employed them as part of a combined arms force along with various kinds of foot troops  however medieval chroniclers tended to pay undue attention to the knights at the expense of the rank and file  which led early students of military history to suppose that this heavy cavalry was the only force that mattered on medieval European battlefields  which was not the case  Massed English longbowmen triumphed over French cavalry at Cr cy  Poitiers and Agincourt  while at Gisors  1188   Bannockburn  1314   and Laupen  1339   foot soldiers proved their invulnerability to cavalry charges as long as they held their formation  Once the Swiss developed their pike squares for offensive as well as defensive use  infantry started to become the principal arm  This aggressive new doctrine gave the Swiss victory over a range of adversaries  and their enemies found that the only reliable way to defeat them was by the use of an even more comprehensive combined arms doctrine  as evidenced in the Battle of Marignano  The introduction of missile weapons that required less skill than the longbow  such as the crossbow and hand cannon  also helped remove the focus somewhat from cavalry elites to masses of cheap infantry equipped with easy to learn weapons  These missile weapons were very successfully used in the Hussite Wars  in combination with Wagenburg tactics  This gradual rise in the dominance of infantry led to the adoption of dismounted tactics  From the earliest times knights and mounted men at arms had frequently dismounted to handle enemies they could not overcome on horseback  such as in the Battle of the Dyle  891  and the Battle of Bremule  1119   but after 1350s this trend became more marked with the dismounted men at arms fighting as super heavy infantry with two handed swords and poleaxes  In any case  warfare in the Middle Ages tended to be dominated by raids and sieges rather than pitched battles  and mounted men at arms rarely had any choice other than dismounting when faced with the prospect of assaulting a fortified position   edit  Renaissance Europe Knighted cavalry and noblemen  painting by Jan van Eyck  ca  1390 1441   Ironically  the rise of infantry in the early 16th century coincided with the  golden age  of heavy cavalry  a French or Spanish army at the beginning of the century could have up to half its numbers made up of various kinds of light and heavy cavalry  whereas in earlier medieval and later 17th century armies the proportion of cavalry was seldom more than a quarter  Knighthood largely lost its military functions and became more closely tied to social and economic prestige in an increasingly capitalistic Western society  With the rise of drilled and trained infantry  the mounted men at arms  now sometimes called gendarmes and often part of the standing army themselves  adopted the same role as in the Hellenistic age  that of delivering a decisive blow once the battle was already engaged  either by charging the enemy in the flank or attacking their commander in chief  From the 1550s onwards  the use of gunpowder weapons solidified infantry s dominance of the battlefield and began to allow true mass armies to develop  This is closely related to the increase in the size of armies throughout the early modern period  heavily armored cavalrymen were expensive to raise and maintain and it took years to replace a skilled horseman or a trained horse  while arquebusiers and later musketeers could be trained and kept in the field at much lower cost  and were much easier to replace  The Spanish tercio and later formations relegated cavalry to a supporting role  The pistol was specifically developed to try to bring cavalry back into the conflict  together with manoeuvres such as the caracole  The caracole was not particularly successful  however  and the charge  whether with sword  pistol  or lance  remained as the primary mode of employment for many types of European cavalry  although by this time it was delivered in much deeper formations and with greater discipline than before  The demi lancers and the heavily armored sword and pistol reiters were among the types of cavalry whose heyday was in the 16th and 17th centuries  as for the Polish winged hussars  a heavy cavalry force that achieved great success against Swedes  Russians  and Turks   edit  18th century Europe and Napoleonic Wars Cavalry charge at Eylau  painted by Simon Fort  Cavalry retained an important role in this age of regularization and standardization across European armies  First and foremost they remained the primary choice for confronting enemy cavalry  Attacking an unbroken infantry force head on usually resulted in failure  but extended linear infantry formations were vulnerable to flank or rear attacks  Cavalry was important at Blenheim  1704   Rossbach  1757   Eylau and Friedland  1807   remaining significant throughout the Napoleonic Wars  Massed infantry was deadly to cavalry  but offered an excellent target for artillery  Once the bombardment had disordered the infantry formation  cavalry were able to rout and pursue the scattered foot soldiers  It was not until individual firearms gained accuracy and improved rates of fire that cavalry was diminished in this role as well  Even then light cavalry remained an indispensable tool for scouting  screening the army s movements  and harassing the enemy s supply lines until military aircraft supplanted them in this role in the early stages of World War I  The greatest cavalry charge of modern history was at the 1807 battle of Eylau  when the entire 11 000 strong French cavalry reserve  led by Mar chal Murat  launched a huge charge on and through the Russian infantry lines  The French horsemen also proved that cavalry could be a decisive element during the Peninsular War in Spain   edit  19th century By the 19th century  European cavalry fell into four main categories  Cuirassiers  heavy cavalry Dragoons  originally mounted infantry but later regarded as medium cavalry Hussars  light cavalry Lancers or Uhlans  light cavalry armed with lances The charge of the First Division s cavalry at the Battle of Carabobo  There were cavalry variations for individual nations as well  France had the chasseurs   cheval  Germany had the J ger zu Pferd  Bavaria had the Chevaulegers  and Russia had Cossacks  Britain s only cuirassiers were the Household Cavalry  but Dragoon Guards regiments were classed as heavy cavalry  In the United States Army the cavalry were almost always dragoons  The Imperial Japanese Army had its cavalry uniformed as hussars  but they fought as dragoons  Union Cavalry capture Confederate guns at Culpepper  In the early American Civil War the regular United States Army mounted rifle  dragoon  and two existing cavalry regiments were reorganized and renamed cavalry regiments  of which there were six  Over a hundred other federal and state cavalry regiments were organized  but the infantry played a much larger role in many battles due to its larger numbers  lower cost per rifle fielded  and much easier recruitment  However  cavalry saw a role as part of screening forces and in foraging and scouting  The later phases of the war saw the Federal army developing a truly effective cavalry force fighting as scouts  raiders  and  with repeating rifles  as mounted infantry  Post Civil War  as the volunteer armies disbanded  the regular army cavalry regiments increased in number from six to ten  among them the U S  7th Cavalry Regiment of Little Bighorn fame  and the African American U S  9th Cavalry Regiment and U S  10th Cavalry Regiment  These units  along with others  both cavalry and infantry   collectively became known as the Buffalo Soldiers  These regiments  which rarely took the field as complete

warfare   where modern weapons were lacking and the slow moving infantry artillery train or fixed fortifications were often ineffective against native insurgents  unless the natives offered a fight on an equal footing  as at Tel el Kebir  Omdurman  etc    Cavalry  flying columns  proved effective  or at least cost effective  in many campaigns although an astute native commander  like Samori in western Africa  Shamil in the Caucasus  or any of the better Boer commanders  could turn the tables and use the greater mobility of their cavalry to offset their relative lack of firepower compared to European forces  The British Indian Army maintained about forty regiments of cavalry  officered by British and manned by Indian sowars  cavalrymen   The legendary exploits of this branch lives on in literature and early films  Among the more famous regiments in the lineages of modern Indian and Pakistani Armies are  The charge of the 21st Lancers at Omdurman Governor General s Bodyguard  now President s Bodyguard  Skinner s Horse  now India s 1st Horse  Skinner s Horse   Gardner s Lancers  now India s 2nd Lancers  Gardner s Horse   Hodson s Horse  now India s 3rd Horse  Hodson s   of the Bengal Lancers fame 6th Bengal Cavalry  later amalgamated with 7th Hariana Lancers to form 18th King Edward s Own Cavalry  now 18th Cavalry of the Indian Army Probyn s Horse  now Pakistani  Royal Deccan Horse  now India s The Deccan Horse  Poona Horse  now India s The Poona Horse  Scinde Horse  now India s The Scinde Horse  Queen s Own Guides Cavalry  now partitioned between Pakistan and India   Several of these formations are still active  though they now are armoured formations  for example Guides Cavalry in Pakistan  44  The French Army maintained substantial cavalry forces in Algeria and Morocco from 1830 until the Second World War  Much of the Mediterranean coastal terrain was suitable for mounted action and there was a long established culture of horsemanship amongst the Arab and Berber inhabitants  The French forces included Spahis  Chasseurs d  Afrique  Foreign Legion cavalry and mounted Goumiers  45   edit  First World War  edit  Pre war developments Italian cavalry officers practice their horsemanship in 1904 outside Rome  At the beginning of the 20th century all armies still maintained substantial cavalry forces  although there was contention over whether their role should revert to that of mounted infantry  the historic dragoon function   Following the experience of the South African War of 1899 1902  where mounted Boer citizen commandos fighting on foot from cover proved superior to regular cavalry  the British Army withdrew lances for all but ceremonial purposes and placed a new emphasis on training for dismounted action  In 1908 however the six British lancer regiments in existence resumed use of this impressive but obsolete weapon for active service  In 1882 the Imperial Russian Army converted all its line hussar and lancer regiments to dragoons  with an emphasis on mounted infantry training  In 1910 these regiments reverted to their historic roles  designations and uniforms   edit  Cavalry during opening stages Austro Hungarian cavalry  1898  German Cavalryman in September 1914  German South West Africa  In August 1914 all combatant armies still retained substantial numbers of cavalry and the mobile nature of the opening battles on both Eastern and Western Fronts provided a number of instances of traditional cavalry actions  though on a smaller and more scattered scale than those of previous wars  The Imperial German Cavalry  while as colourful and traditional as any in peacetime appearance  had adopted a practice of falling back on infantry support when any substantial opposition was encountered  These cautious tactics aroused derision amongst their more conservative French and Russian opponents but proved appropriate to the new nature of warfare  A single attempt by the German army  on 12 August 1914  to use six regiments of massed cavalry to cut off the Belgian field army from Antwerp foundered when they were driven back in disorder by rifle fire  46  Once the front lines stabilised  a combination of barbed wire  machine guns and rapid fire rifles proved deadly to horse mounted troops   edit  Cavalry in Europe 1915 18 For the remainder of the War on the Western Front cavalry had virtually no role to play  The British and French armies dismounted many of their cavalry regiments and used them in infantry and other roles  the Life Guards for example spent the last months of the War as a machine gun corps  and the Australian Light Horse served as light infantry during the Gallipoli campaign  In September 1914 cavalry comprised 9 28  of the total manpower of the British Expeditionary Force in France   by July 1918 this proportion had fallen to 1 65   47  The German Army dismounted nearly all their cavalry in the West  French cuirassiers  wearing breastplates and helmets  parade through Paris on the way to battle  August 1914  Some cavalry were retained as mounted troops behind the lines in anticipation of a penetration of the opposing trenches that it seemed would never come  Tanks  introduced on the Western Front in September 1916  had the capacity to achieve such breakthroughs but did not have the reliable range to exploit them  Since mounted troops were too vulnerable and slow moving to act in effective support of the new weapon  history recorded no significant role for cavalry in mechanized warfare  and post war planning in the allied nations replaced horse cavalry with mechanized cavalry  In the wider spaces of the Eastern Front a more fluid form of warfare continued and there was still a use for mounted troops  Some wide ranging actions were fought  again mostly in the early months of the war  48  However  even here the value of cavalry was over rated and the maintenance of large mounted formations at the front by the Russian Army put a major strain on the railway system  to little strategic advantage  49   edit  Mounted troops in the Middle East In the Middle East  during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign mounted forces  British  Indian  Ottoman  Australian  Arab and New Zealand  retained an important role of the mounted infantry variety  In Egypt the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and Australian Light Horse of Anzac Mounted Division drove German and Ottoman forces back from Romani to Magdhaba and Rafa and out of the Sinai Peninsular in 1916  After a stalemate on the Gaza   Beersheba line until October 1917  Beersheba was captured by light horsemen and British Yeomanry and the Australian and New Zealand brigades made a coordinated attack  Shortly after  with British Empire infantry divisions Desert Mounted Corps drove two Ottoman armies back to the Jaffa   Jerusalem line  capturing Jerusalem  A pause in operations necessitated by the Spring Offensive in 1918 on the Western Front was followed by the successful breaching of the Ottoman line on the Mediterranean coast by the British Empire infantry in the XX and XXI Corps  Subsequently the 4th  5th Cavalry and Australian Mounted Divisions of Desert Mounted Corps advanced in a coordinated attack with the infantry to captured the Eighth Ottoman Army and occupy Damascus and Aleppo while Chaytor s Force including the Anzac Mounted Division  captured most of the Fourth Ottoman Army and occupied Es Salt and Amman  just before the Armistice with the Ottoman Empire  50   edit  Post World War I A combination of military conservatism in almost all armies and post war financial constraints prevented the lessons of 1914 18 being acted on immediately  There was a general reduction in the number of cavalry regiments in the British  French  Italian and other Western armies but it was still argued with conviction  for example in the 1922 edition of the Encyclop dia Britannica  that mounted troops had a major role to play in future warfare  The 1920s saw an interim period during which cavalry remained as a proud and conspicuous element of all major armies  though much less so than prior to 1914  Cavalry was extensively used in the Russian Civil War and the Soviet Polish War  The last major cavalry battle was the Battle of Komar w in 1920  between Poland and the Russian Bolsheviks  Colonial warfare in Morocco  Syria  the Middle East and the North West Frontier of India provided some opportunities for mounted action against enemies lacking advanced weaponry  The post war German Army  Reichsheer  was permitted a large proportion of cavalry  18 regiments or 16 4  of total manpower  under the conditions of the Treaty of Versailles  The U S  Cavalry abandoned its sabres in 1934 and commenced the conversion of its horsed regiments to mechanized cavalry  starting with the First Regiment of Cavalry in January 1933  In the British Army  all cavalry regiments were mechanised between 1929 and 1941  redefining their role from horse to armoured vehicles to form the Royal Armoured Corps together with the Royal Tank Regiment  The thirty nine regiments of the Indian Army were reduced to twenty one as the result of a series of amalgamations immediately following World War I  The new establishment remained unchanged until 1936 when three regiments were redesignated as permanent training units  each with six  still mounted  regiments linked to them  In 1938 the process of mechanism began with the conversion of a full cavalry brigade  two Indian regiments and one British  to armoured car and tank units  By the end of 1940 all of the Indian cavalry had been mechanised  receiving light tanks  armoured cars or 15cwt trucks  The last horsed regiment of the Indian Army  other than the Viceregal Bodyguard and some Indian States Forces regiments  was the 19th King George s Own Lancers which had its last mounted parade at Rawalpindi on 28 October 1939  This unit still exists  though in the Pakistan Army  with an armour TOE  During the 1930s the French Army experimented with integrating mounted and mechanised cavalry units into larger formations  Dragoon regiments were converted to motorised infantry  trucks and motor cycles   and cuirassiers to armoured units  while light cavalry  Chasseurs a  Cheval  Hussars and Spahis  remained as mounted sabre squadrons  The theory was that mixed forces comprising these diverse units could utilise the strengths of each according to circumstances  In practice mounted troops proved unable to keep up with fast moving mechanised units over any distance   edit  World War II Polish cavalry galloping through a bombed town during the German invasion of Poland in 1939  While most armies still maintained cavalry units at the outbreak of World War II in 1939  significant mounted action was largely restricted to the Polish  Balkan and Soviet campaigns  A popular myth is that Polish cavalry armed with lances charged German tanks during the September 1939 campaign  This arose from misreporting of a single clash on 1 September near Krojanty  when two squadrons of the Polish 18th Lancers armed with sabres scattered German infantry before being caught in the open by German armoured cars  51  Two examples illustrate how the myth developed  First  because motorised vehicles were in short supply  the Poles used horses to pull anti tank weapons into position  52  Second  there were a few incidents when Polish cavalry was trapped by German tanks  and attempted to fight free  However  this did not mean that the Polish army chose to attack tanks with horse cavalry  53  Later  on the Eastern Front  the Red Army did deploy cavalry units effectively against the Germans  54   See also Polish cavalry   A more correct term should be  mounted infantry  instead of  cavalry   as horses were primarily used as a means of transportation  for which they were very suitable in view of the very poor road conditions in pre war Poland  Another myth describes Polish cavalry as being armed with both sabres and lances  lances were used for peacetime ceremonial purposes only and the primary weapon of the Polish cavalryman in 1939 was a rifle  Individual equipment did include a sabre  probably because of well established tradition  but in the case of a melee combat this secondary weapon would probably be more effective than a rifle and bayonet  Moreover  the Polish cavalry brigade order of battle of 1939 included  apart from the mounted soldiers themselves  light and heavy machine guns  wheeled   Anti tank rifle  model 35  anti aircraft weapon  artillery like Bofors 37 mm anti tank gun or light and scout tanks  etc  The last  in Europe  cavalry vs  cavalry mutual charge took place in Poland during the battle of Krasnobrod when the Polish and German cavalry units charged each other  The Italian invasion of Greece in October 1940 saw mounted cavalry used effectively by the Greek defenders along the mountainous frontier with Albania  Three Greek cavalry regiments  two mounted and one partially mechanised  played an important role in the Italian defeat in this difficult terrain  55  By the final stages of the war only the Soviet Union was still fielding mounted units in substantial numbers  some in combined mechanized and horse units  The advantage of this approach was that in exploitation mounted infantry could keep pace with advancing tanks  Other factors favouring the retention of mounted forces included the high quality of Russian Cossacks and other horse cavalry  and the relative lack of roads suitable for wheeled vehicles in many parts of the Eastern Front  Another consideration was that the logistic capacity required to support very large motorised forces exceeded that necessary for mounted troops  Romanian  Hungarian and Italian cavalry had been dispersed or disbanded following the retreat of the Axis forces from Russia  Germany still maintained some mounted  mixed with bicycles  SS and Cossack units until the last days of the War  18th Indian Cavalry Regiment  later 18 Cavalry of Indian Army   fought in a dismounted role  in Tobruk as part of 9th Australian Division  The U S  Army s last horse cavalry actions were fought during World War II  a  by the 26th Cavalry Regiment  PS  in World War II   a small mounted regiment of Philippine Scouts which fought the Japanese during the retreat down the Bataan peninsula  until it was effectively destroyed by January 1942  and b  on captured German horses by the mounted reconnaissance section of the U S  10th Mountain Division in a spearhead pursuit of the German Army across the Po Valley in Italy in April 1945  56  The last horsed U S  Cavalry  the Second Cavalry Division  were dismounted in March 1944  All British Army cavalry regiments had been mechanised since 1 March 1942 when the Queen s Own Yorkshire Dragoons  Yeomanry  was converted to a motorised role  following mounted service against the Vichy French in Syria the previous year  The final cavalry charge by British Empire forces occurred on 21 March 1942 when a 60 strong patrol of the Burma Frontier Force encountered Japanese infantry near Toungoo airfield in central Burma  The Sikh sowars of the Frontier Force cavalry  led by Captain Arthur Sandeman of the The Central India Horse  21st King George V s Own Horse   charged in the old style with sabres and most were killed  The last substantive and successful classical cavalry charge of the war that made on March 1  1945 during the Battle of Schoenfeld by the 1st  Warsaw  Independent Cavalry Brigade  Infantry and tanks had been employed to little effect against the German position  both of which floundered in the open wetlands only to be dominated by infantry and antitank fire from the German fortifications on the forward slope of Hill 157  overlooking the wetlands  The Germans had not taken cavalry into consideration when fortifying their position which  combined with the  Warsaw s swift assault  overran the German anti tank guns and consolidated into an attack into the village itself  now supported by infantry and tanks   edit  Post World War II to present day Polish PZL W 3 Sok   of the 66 Air Force Squadron  25th Aeromobile Cavalry Brigade  The Soviet Army retained horse cavalry divisions until 1955  and even at the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991  there was an independent horse mounted cavalry squadron in Kyrgyzstan  57  While most modern  cavalry  units have some historic connection with formerly mounted troops this is not always the case  The modern Irish Defence Force  IDF  includes a  Cavalry Corps  equipped with Panhard armoured cars and Scorpion tracked combat reconnaissance vehicles  The IDF has never included horse cavalry since its establishment in 1922  other than a small mounted escort drawn from the Artillery Corps when required for ceremonial occasions   However  the mystique of the cavalry is such that the name has been introduced for what was always a mechanised force  United States Army Special Forces on horseback with the Northern Alliance of Afghanistan  which frequently used horses as military transport  Some engagements in late 20th and early 21st century guerrilla wars involved mounted troops  particularly against partisan or guerrilla fighters in areas with poor transport infrastructure  Such units were not used as cavalry but rather as mounted infantry  Examples occurred in Afghanistan  Portuguese Africa and Rhodesia  The French Army used existing mounted squadrons of Spahis to a limited extent for patrol work during the Algerian War  1954 62  and the Swiss Army maintained a mounted dragoon regiment for combat purposes until 1973  There were reports of Chinese mounted troops in action during frontier clashes with Vietnam in the mid late 1970s  The Portuguese Army used horse mounted cavalry with some success in the wars of independence in Angola and Mozambique in the 1960s and 1970s  During the 1964 79 Rhodesian Bush War the Rhodesian Army created an elite mounted infantry unit called Grey s Scouts to fight unconventional actions against the rebel forces of Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo  The horse mounted infantry of the Scouts were effective and reportedly feared by their opponents in the rebel African forces  In the 1978 to present Afghan Civil War period there have been several instances of horse mounted combat  South and Central American armies maintained mounted cavalry for longer than those of Europe  Asia or North America  The Mexican Army included a number of horse mounted cavalry regiments as late as the mid 1990s and the Chilean Army had five such regiments in 1983 as mounted mountain troops  see Jane s  Armed Forces of Latin America  by Adrian J  English   A number of armored regiments in the British

branch as a whole are now mounted  Cavalry of the French Republican Guard   May 8  2005 celebrations In the Canadian Army  a number of regular and reserve units have cavalry roots  including The Royal Canadian Hussars  Montreal   the Governor General s Horse Guards  Lord Strathcona s Horse  the Royal Canadian Dragoons  and the South Alberta Light Horse  Of these  only Lord Strathcona s Horse 60  and the Governor General s Horse Guards maintain an official ceremonial horse mounted cavalry troop or squadron  61  Both the Australian and New Zealand armies follow the British practice of maintaining traditional titles  Light Horse or Mounted Rifles  for modern mechanised units  However  neither country retains a horse mounted unit  Today  the Indian Army s 61st Cavalry is reported to be the largest remaining non ceremonial horse mounted cavalry in the world  62  It was raised in 1951 from the amalgamated state cavalry squadrons of Gwailior  Jodhpur  and Mysore  While primarily utilised for ceremonial purposes  the regiment can be deployed for internal security or police roles if required  63  The 61st Cavalry and the President s Body Guard parade in full dress uniform in New Delhi each year in what is probably the largest assembly of traditional cavalry still to be seen in the world  Both the Indian and the Pakistani armies maintain armoured regiments with the titles of Lancers or Horse  dating back to the 19th century  As of 2007 the Chinese People s Liberation Army employed two battalions of horse cavalry in Xinjing Military District for border patrol work  see China Defense com website   In the wake of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake  there have been calls to rebuild the army horse inventory for disaster relief in difficult terrain  Recent Chinese media reporting 64  confirms that the Chinese army maintains operational horse cavalry at squadron strength in the Mongolia Autonomous Region   edit  Light and armored cavalry See also  Heavy cavalry and light cavalry Alexander the Great using armoured cavalry  fighting Persian King Darius III Historically  cavalry was divided into light and armoured cavalry and Horse archers  The differences were their role in combat  the size of the mount  and how much armor was worn by the mount and rider  Early light cavalry  like the auxiliaries of the Roman army  were typically used to scout and skirmish  to cut down retreating infantry  and for defeating enemy missile troops  Armoured cavalry such as the Byzantine Cataphract were used as shock troops they would charge the main body of the enemy and  in many cases  their actions decided the outcome of the battle  hence the later term  battle cavalry   65  During the Gunpowder Age  armored cavalry become obsolete  However  many units retained cuirasses and helmets for their protective value against sword and bayonet strikes and the morale boost these provide to the wearers  By this time the main difference between light and battle cavalry was their training  the former was regarded as a tool for harassment and reconnaissance  while the latter was considered best for close order charges  Since the development of armored warfare the distinction between light and heavy armor has persisted basically along the same lines  Armored cars and light tanks have adopted the reconnaissance role while medium and heavy tanks are regarded as the decisive shock troops   edit  Social status From the beginning of civilization to the 20th century  ownership of heavy cavalry horses has been a mark of wealth amongst settled peoples  A cavalry horse involves considerable expense in breeding  training  feeding  and equipment  and has very little productive use except as a mode of transport  For this reason  and because of their often decisive military role  the cavalry has typically been associated with high social status  This was most clearly seen in the feudal system  where a lord was expected to enter combat armored and on horseback and bring with him an entourage of peasants on foot  If landlords and peasants came into conflict  the peasants would be ill equipped to defeat armored knights  A Trooper of the Blues and Royals on mounted duty in Whitehall  London In later national armies  service as an officer in the cavalry was generally a badge of high social status  For instance prior to 1914 most officers of British cavalry regiments came from a socially privileged background and the considerable expenses associated with their role generally required private means  even after it became possible for officers of the line infantry regiments to live on their pay  Options open to poorer cavalry officers in the various European armies included service with less fashionable  though often highly professional  frontier or colonial units  These included the British Indian cavalry  the Russian Cossacks or the French Chasseurs d  Afrique  During the 19th and early 20th centuries most monarchies maintained a mounted cavalry element in their royal or imperial guards  These ranged from small units providing ceremonial escorts and palace guards through to large formations intended for active service  The mounted escort of the Spanish Royal Household provided an example of the former and the twelve cavalry regiments of the Prussian Imperial Guard an example of the latter  In either case the officers of such units were likely to be drawn from the aristocracies of their respective societies   edit  On film Some small sense of the noise and power of a cavalry charge can be gained from the 1970 film Waterloo  which featured some 2000 cavalrymen  citation needed  some of them cossacks  It included detailed displays of the horsemanship required to manage animal and weapons in large numbers at the gallop  unlike the real battle of Waterloo  where deep mud significantly slowed the horses   66  The Gary Cooper movie They Came to Cordura contains an excellent scene of a cavalry regiment deploying from march to battleline formation  A smaller scale cavalry charge can be seen in The Lord of the Rings  The Return of the King  2003   although the finished scene has substantial
