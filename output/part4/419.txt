beggar woman offers a young prince a rose in exchange for a night s shelter  When he turns her away  she punishes him by transforming him into an ugly Beast and turning his servants into furniture and other household items  She gives him a magic mirror that will enable him to view faraway events  and she gives him the rose  which will bloom until his twenty first birthday  He must love and be loved in return before all the rose s petals have fallen off  or he will remain a Beast forever  Years later  a beautiful young woman named Belle comes along  living in a nearby French village with her father Maurice  an inventor  Belle loves reading and yearns for a life beyond the village  Her beauty attracts attention in the town and she is pursued by many men  but mostly the arrogant local hero  Gaston  although Belle has no interest in him  despite the fact that he is sought after by all the single females and is considered godlike in perfection by the male population of the town  As Maurice travels to a fair  he gets lost on the way and is chased by wolves before stumbling upon the Beast s castle  where he meets the transformed servants Lumi re  a candelabra   Cogsworth  a clock   Mrs  Potts  a teapot   and her son Chip  a teacup   The Beast imprisons Maurice  but Belle is led back to the castle by Maurice s horse and offers to take her father s place which the Beast agrees to  While Gaston is sulking over his humiliation in the tavern  Maurice tells him and the other villagers what happened but they think he has lost his mind  At the castle  the Beast orders Belle to dine with him  but she refuses  and Lumiere disobeys his order not to let her eat  After Cogsworth gives her a tour of the castle  she finds the rose in the forbidden West Wing and the Beast angrily chases her away  Frightened  she tries to escape  but she and her horse are attacked by wolves  After the Beast rescues her  she nurses his wounds  and he begins to develop feelings for her  The Beast grants Belle access to the castle library  which impresses Belle and they become friends  growing closer as they spend more time together  Meanwhile  the spurned Gaston pays the warden of the town s insane asylum to have Maurice committed unless Belle agrees to Gaston s marriage proposal  Back at the castle Belle and the Beast share a romantic evening together  Belle tells the Beast she misses her father  and he lets her use the magic mirror to see him  When Belle sees him dying in the woods in an attempt to rescue her  the Beast allows her to leave to rescue her father  giving her the mirror to remember him by  As he watches her leave  the Beast admits to Cogsworth that he loves Belle  Belle finds her father and takes him home  Gaston arrives to carry out his plan  but Belle proves Maurice sane by showing them the Beast with the magic mirror  Realizing Belle has feelings for the Beast  Gaston arouses the mob s anger against the Beast  and leads them to the castle  Gaston locks Belle and Maurice in the basement  though Chip  who had hidden himself in Belle s baggage  uses one of Maurice s inventions to free them  While the servants and Gaston s mob fight in the castle  Gaston hunts down the Beast  The Beast is initially too depressed to fight back  but he regains his will when he sees Belle returning to the castle with Maurice  After winning a heated battle  the Beast spares Gaston s life  demanding that he leave the castle  As the Beast is about to reunite with Belle  Gaston  refusing to admit defeat  stabs the Beast from behind  but loses his balance and falls off the balcony to his death  Just as the Beast succumbs to his wounds  Belle whispers that she loves him  breaking the spell just as the rose s last petal falls  The Beast comes back to life  his human form restored  As he and Belle kiss  the castle and its inhabitants return to their previous states as well  Belle and the prince dance in the ballroom with her father and the humanized servants happily watching   edit  Cast and crew  edit  Cast and characters Main article  Characters in Disney s Beauty and the Beast Paige O Hara as Belle    Animation   James Baxter and Mark Henn    A bookish young woman who falls in love with the Beast  In their effort to enhance the character from the original story  the filmmakers felt that Belle should be  unaware  of her own beauty and made her  a little odd   6  Wise recalls casting O Hara because of a  unique tone  she had   a little bit of Judy Garland   whose appearance she was modeled after  7  Robby Benson as The Beast    Animation   Glen Keane    A cold hearted prince transformed into a beast as punishment for his selfishness  Chris Sanders  one of the film s storyboard artists  drafted the designs for the Beast and came up with designs based on birds  insects and fish before coming up with something close to the final design  8 Glen Keane  supervising animator for the Beast  refined the design by going to the zoo and studying the animals on which the Beast was based  8  Benson commented   There s a rage and torment in this character I ve never been asked to use before   9  The filmmakers commented that  everybody was big fee fi fo fum and gravelly  while Benson s voice had the  big voice and the warm  accessible side  and that  you could hear the prince beneath the fur   8  Richard White as Gaston    Animation   Andreas Deja  Ron Husband  David Burgess  Tim Allen    A highly egotistical hunter who vies for Belle s hand in marriage and is determined not to let anyone else win her heart  He commented that they had  big line ups of good looking men with deep voices  during the casting auditions  but that Richard White had a  big voice  that  rattled the room   8  Gaston s supervising animator  Andreas Deja  was pressed by Jeffrey Katzenberg to make Gaston handsome in contrast to the traditional appearance of a Disney villain  an assignment he found difficult at first  10  Jerry Orbach as Lumi re    Animation   Nik Raineri    The kind hearted but rebellious ma tre d  of the Beast s castle  he has been transformed into a candelabra  He has a habit of disobeying his master s strict rules  sometimes causing tension between them  but the Beast often turns to him for advice  He is depicted as a bit of a ladies  man  as he is frequently seen with Babette the Featherduster and immediately takes to Belle  David Ogden Stiers as Cogsworth    Animation   Will Finn    The castle majordomo and Lumiere s best friend  transformed into a clock  While he is as good natured as Lumiere  he is extremely loyal to the Beast so as to save himself and anyone else any trouble  often leading to friction between himself and Lumiere  Stiers also provided the voice of the narrator  Angela Lansbury as Mrs  Potts    Animation   David Pruiksma    The head of the castle kitchens  turned into a teapot  who takes a motherly attitude toward Belle  The filmmakers went through several names for Mrs  Potts  such as  Mrs  Chamomile   before Ashman suggested the use of simple and concise names for the household objects  8  Bradley Michael Pierce as Chip    Animation   David Pruiksma    A teacup and Mrs  Potts  son  Originally intended to have only one line  the filmmakers were impressed with Pierce s performance and expanded the character s role significantly  eschewing a mute Music Box character  8  Rex Everhart as Maurice    Animation   Ruben Aquino  Belle s inventor father  Jesse Corti as Le Fou    Animation   Chris Wahl    Gaston s bumbling and often mistreated  but loyal and rather clever sidekick  Hal Smith as Philippe    Animation   Russ Edmonds    Belle s horse  Jo Anne Worley as Madame De la Grande Bouche Wardrobe    Animation   Tony Anselmo  The castle s authority over fashion  and a former opera singer  turned into a wardrobe  The character of Wardrobe was introduced by visual development person Sue C  Nichols to the then entirely male cast of servants  and was originally a more integral character named  Madame Armoire   Wardrobe is known as  Madame de la Grande Bouche   Madame Big Mouth  in the stage adaptation of the film  Kimmy Robertson as Babette the Featherduster   A featherduster and Lumiere s lover  She is named  Babette  in the stage adaptation of the film  and  Fifi  in Belle s Magical World  Frank Welker as Footstool  aka Sultan   The castle s pet dog

edit  Localization In the Chinese versions of Beauty and the Beast  the voice of the Beast is provided by Jackie Chan  He provided both the speaking and singing voices in these versions  In September 2007  CCTV6  a Chinese film channel  aired a newly dubbed version of Beauty and the Beast in which Beast s voice is performed by     Wang Kai  Together with this version  a translated version of the pop version of the  Beauty and the Beast  theme song was released  which was translated by Chan Siu Kei and sung by Nicholas Tse Ting Fung and Meilin  11  This translated theme song was released separately before the film aired and is not included in the new Chinese version  which uses another translation of lyrics  translated by Han Wen       Two Spanish versions exist  one in Mexican Spanish for the Latin American market  the other in Castilian Spanish for the European market  In the Mexican version  the voice of LeFou is provided by the same actor who played the role in English  Venezuelan American voice actor Jesse Corti  12  In the Italian version  the theme song is performed by the famous Italian singer Gino Paoli and his daughter Amanda Sandrelli  Unlike in the English version  the first part of the song is sung by a man  Gino Paoli  in the original Celine Dion  and the second part by a woman  Amanda Sandrelli  in the original Peabo Bryson   For the French version  the theme song is performed by Charles Aznavour and Liane Foly in the original release  When it was released again in 2002  the theme song was sung by Patrick Fiori and Julie Zenatti  The voice of Mrs  Potts also changed in the 2002 release  In the original  Mrs  Potts was voiced by Lucie Dol ne  the same actress who gave voice to Snow White in 1962  second dubbing   However  because of some disagreements  Lucie Dol ne s voice replaced by Lily Baron for the spoken parts and Christiane Legrand for the sung parts  In the Swedish version  the theme song is provided by Tommy K rberg and Sofia K llgren  who also provide the voices of Beast and Belle  respectively  in the film  In the Greek version of the film  Beast was voiced by the singer Yiannis Palamidas  who also voiced Sebastian in the 1989 Greek dub of The Little Mermaid and Rex in Toy Story  Belle s voice is provided by the well known Greek singer Kristi Stassinopoulou  who aso voiced Ariel in the 1989 Greek dub of The Little Mermaid   edit  Production  edit  Early versions Walt Disney sought out other stories to turn into feature films after the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs  and Beauty and the Beast was among the stories he considered  6  13  Attempts to develop the Beauty and the Beast story into a film were made in the 1930s and 1950s  but were ultimately given up because it  proved to be a challenge  for the story team  6  Peter M  Nichols states Disney may later have been discouraged by Jean Cocteau having already done his version  14  Decades later  after the success of Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988  the Disney studio resurrected Beauty and the Beast as a project for the satellite animation studio it had set up in London  England to work on Roger Rabbit  15 Richard Williams  who had directed the animated portions of Roger Rabbit  was approached to direct  but declined in favor of continuing work on his long gestating project The Thief and the Cobbler  15  In his place  Williams recommended his colleague  English animation director Richard Purdum  and work began under producer Don Hahn on a non musical version of Beauty and the Beast set in Victorian France  15  At the behest of Disney CEO Michael Eisner  Beauty and the Beast became the first Disney animated film to use a screenwriter  This was an unusual production move for an animated film  which is traditionally developed on storyboards rather than in scripted form  16 Linda Woolverton wrote the original draft of the story before storyboarding began  and worked with the story team to retool and develop the film  16   edit  Script rewrite and musicalization Upon seeing the initial storyboard reels in 1989  Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg ordered that the film be scrapped and started over from scratch  15  A few months after starting anew  Purdam resigned as director  The studio had approached Ron Clements and John Musker to direct the film but turned down the offer saying they were  tired  after just having finished directing Disney s recent success The Little Mermaid  Disney then hired first time feature directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale  Wise and Trousdale had previously directed the animated sections of Cranium Command  a short film for a Disney EPCOT theme park attraction  15  In addition  Katzenberg asked songwriters Howard Ashman and Alan Menken  who had written the song score for The Little Mermaid to turn Beauty and the Beast into a Broadway style musical film in the same vein as Mermaid  Ashman  who at the time had learned he was dying of complications from AIDS  had been working with Disney on a pet project of his  Aladdin  and only reluctantly agreed to join the struggling production team  15  To accommodate Ashman s failing health  pre production of Beauty and the Beast was moved from London to the Residence Inn in Fishkill  New York  close to Ashman s New York City home  15  Here  Ashman and Menken joined Wise  Trousdale  Hahn  and Woolverton in retooling the film s script  6  16  Since the original story had only two major characters  the filmmakers enhanced them  added new characters in the form of enchanted household items who  add warmth and comedy to a gloomy story  and guide the audience through the film  and added a  real villain  in the form of Gaston  6  These ideas were somewhat similar to elements of the 1946 French film version of Beauty and the Beast  which introduced the character of Avenant  an oafish suitor somewhat similar to Gaston 17  as well as inanimate objects coming to life in the Beast s castle  18  The animated objects were  however  given distinct personalities in the Disney version  By early 1990  Katzenberg had approved the revised script  and storyboarding began again  6  16  The production flew story artists back and forth between California and New York for storyboard approvals from Ashman  though the team was not told the reason why  6  A frame from the  Beauty and the Beast  ballroom dance sequence  The background is animated with CAPS in order to give the illusion of a dollying film camera   edit  Animation Production of Beauty and the Beast had to be completed on a compressed timeline of two years rather than four because of the loss of production time spent developing the earlier Purdam version of the film  8  Most of the production was done at the main Feature Animation studio  housed in the Air Way facility in Glendale  California  A smaller team at the Disney MGM Studios theme park in Lake Buena Vista  Florida assisted the California team on several scenes  particularly the  Be Our Guest  number  6  Beauty and the Beast was the second film produced using CAPS  Computer Animation Production System   a digital scanning  ink  paint  and compositing system of software and hardware developed for Disney by Pixar  6  15  The software allowed for a wider range of colors  as well as soft shading and colored line effects for the characters  techniques lost when the Disney studio abandoned hand inking for xerography in the late 1950s  8  CAPS also allowed the production crew to simulate multiplane effects  placing characters and or backgrounds on separate layers and moving them towards away from the camera on the Z axis to give the illusion of depth  as well as altering the focus of each layer  In addition  CAPS allowed easier combination of hand drawn art with computer generated imagery  which before had to be plotted to animation cels and painted traditionally  6  19  This technique was put to significant use during the  Beauty and the Beast  waltz sequence  in which Belle and Beast dance through a computer generated ballroom as the camera dollies around them in simulated 3D space  6  8  The filmmakers had originally decided against the use of computers in favor of traditional animation  but later  when the technology had improved  decided it could be used for the one scene in the ballroom  14  The success of the ballroom sequence helped convince studio executives to further invest in computer animation  20   edit  Music See also  Beauty and the Beast  soundtrack  Ashman and Menken wrote the Beauty song score during the pre production process in Fishkill  the opening operetta styled  Belle  being their first composition for the film  6  Other songs included  Be Our Guest   sung to Belle by the objects when she becomes the first visitor to eat at the castle in a decade   Gaston   a solo for the swaggering villain   Human Again   a song describing Belle and Beast s growing love from the objects  perspective  the love ballad  Beauty and the Beast   and the climactic  The Mob Song   As story and song development came to a close  full production began in Burbank while voice and song recording began in New York City  6  The Beauty songs were mostly recorded live with the orchestra and the voice cast performing simultaneously rather than overdubbed separately  in order to give the songs a cast album like  energy  the filmmakers and songwriters desired  8  During the course of production  many changes were made to the structure of the film  necessitating the replacement and re purposing of songs  After screening a mostly animated version of the  Be Our Guest  sequence  story artist Bruce Woodside suggested that the objects should be singing the song to Belle rather than her father  6  Wise and Trousdale agreed  and the sequence and song were retooled to replace Maurice with Belle  6   Human Again  was dropped from the film before animation began  as its lyrics caused story problems about the timeline over which the story takes place  6  This required Ashman and Menken to write a new song in its place   Something There   in which Belle and Beast sing  via voiceover  of their growing fondness for each other  was composed late in production and inserted into the script in place of  Human Again   8  Menken would later revise  Human Again  for inclusion in the 1994 Broadway stage version of Beauty and the Beast  and another revised version of the song was added to the film itself in a new sequence created for the film s Special Edition re release in 2002  6  8  Ashman died of AIDS related complications on March 14  1991  eight months prior to the release of the film  He never saw the finished film  and his work on Aladdin was completed by another lyricist

Ashman  1950 1991   A pop version of the  Beauty and the Beast  theme  performed by C line Dion and Peabo Bryson over the end credits  was released as a commercial single from the film s soundtrack  supported with a music video  The Dion Bryson version of  Beauty and the Beast  became an international pop hit  reaching the Top Ten of the singles charts in the United States and the United Kingdom 21  22  Later home video releases of Beauty and the Beast would include  as bonus features  new music videos featuring covers of the title song by Jump 5  for the 2002 DVD release  and Jordin Sparks

in progress   Storyboards and pencil tests were used in place of the remaining 30   In addition  parts of the film that were finished were  stepped back  to previous versions of completion  The  work in progress  version of Beauty and the Beast played to a standing ovation from the film festival audience  15  The completed film would also be screened out of competition at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival  23  The finished film premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood on November 13  1991  and went into wide release through Walt Disney Pictures on November 22  Disney initially planned a re release of the film to be released theatrically in December 1998 in an attempt of counterprogramming against DreamWorks  The Prince of Egypt  The idea to restore the  Human Again  sequence was originally for this re issue  However  due to impending competition from the aforementioned Prince of Egypt as well as The Rugrats Movie  Babe  Pig in the City and Jack Frost as well as Disney s own holiday release schedule being quite full with Enemy of the State  A Bug s Life and Mighty Joe Young  the re release was delayed to spring 1999  When Disney decided to bump Doug s 1st Movie from direct to video to a theatrical release  that film took the re release s date  delaying it to the holiday season  Presumably due to competition  like the year before  and Disney s own efforts to promote Toy Story 2  this release date was also canceled  In 2002  Beauty and the Beast was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed  culturally  historically  or aesthetically significant   The film was restored and remastered for its New Year s Day  2002 re release in IMAX theatres in a special edition edit including a new musical sequence  For this version of the film  much of the animation was cleaned up  a new sequence set to the deleted song  Human Again  was inserted into the film s second act  and a new digital master from the original CAPS production files was used to make the high resolution IMAX film negative  A sing along edition of the film  hosted by Jordin Sparks  was released in select theaters on September 29 and October 2  2010  Prior to the showing of the film Sparks showed an exclusive behind the scenes look at the newly restored high definition animated classic and the making of her all new Beauty and the Beast music video  There was also commentary from producer Don Hahn  interviews with the cast and an inside look at how the animation was created  24  A 3D version of the film was originally scheduled to be released in US theatres on February 12  2010  but the project was postponed  25  On August 25  2011  Disney announced that the 3D version of the film would make its cinematic debut in the United States at Hollywood s El Capitan Theatre from September 2 15  2011  26  Disney spent less than  10 million on the 3D conversion  27  After the successful 3D re release of The Lion King  Disney announced a wide 3D re release of Beauty and the Beast in North America beginning January 13  2012  28   edit  Home media releases Blu ray Diamond edition cover The film was released to VHS and

except for the added 3D disc and digital copy  33   edit  Reception Upon the theatrical release of the finished version  the film was universally praised  with Roger Ebert giving it four stars out of four and saying that  Beauty and the Beast reaches back to an older and healthier Hollywood tradition in which the best writers  musicians and filmmakers are gathered for a project on the assumption that a family audience deserves great entertainment  too   He ranked the film as the third best film of 1991  James Berardinelli gave the film a four out of four stars and says   As a romance  Beauty and the Beast is a delightful confection  creating a pair of memorable  three dimensional characters and giving us reason to root for their union   Berardinelli has called the film the greatest animated film of all time and has ranked it  56 in his Top 100 Films  ahead of other famous films like  71 The Wizard of Oz   80 To Kill a Mockingbird  and  94 Lawrence of Arabia  The film received mostly positive reviews  among them some of the best notices the studio had received since the 1940s  15 Rotten Tomatoes  a film review aggregator  shows Beauty and the Beast with a 92  approval rating as of February 2012 averaged from 83 reviews of the original theatrical release and later theatrical and home video versions  34  The use of computer animation  particularly in the  Beauty and the Beast  ballroom sequence  was singled out in several reviews as one of the film s highlights  8  Smoodin writes in his book Animating Culture that the studio was trying to make up for earlier gender stereotypes with this film  35  Smoodin also states that  in the way it has been viewed as bringing together traditional fairy tales and feminism as well as computer and traditional animation  the film s  greatness could be proved in terms of technology narrative or even politics   36  Another author writes that Belle  becomes a sort of intellectual less by actually reading books  it seems  than by hanging out with them   but says that the film comes closer than other  Disney studio  films to  accepting challenges of the kind that the finest Walt Disney features met   37  David Whitley writes in The Idea of Nature in Disney Animation that Belle is different from earlier Disney heroines in that she is mostly free from the burdens of domestic housework  although her role is somewhat undefined in the same way that  contemporary culture now requires most adolescent girls to contribute little in the way of domestic work before they leave home and have to take on the fraught  multiple responsibilities of the working mother   38  Whitley also notes other themes and modern influences  such as the film s critical view of Gaston s chauvinism and attitude towards nature  the cyborg like servants  and the father s role as an inventor rather than a merchant  38  Betsy Hearne  editor of The Bulletin of the Center for Children s Books  writes that the film belittles the original story s moral about  inner beauty   as well as the heroine herself  in favor of a more brutish struggle   In fact   she says   it is not Beauty s lack of love that almost kills Disney s beast  but a rival s dagger   39  Stefan Kanfer writes in his book Serious Business that in this film  the tradition of the musical theater was fully co opted   such as in the casting of Broadway performers
