  officially known as the Republic of Chad  is a landlocked country in Central Africa  It is bordered by Libya to the north  Sudan to the east  the Central African Republic to the south  Cameroon and Nigeria to the southwest  and Niger to the west  Due to its distance from the sea and its largely desert climate  the country is sometimes referred to as the  Dead Heart of Africa   Chad is divided into multiple regions  a desert zone in the north  an arid Sahelian belt in the centre and a more fertile Sudanese savanna zone in the south  Lake Chad  after which the country is named  is the largest wetland in Chad and the second largest in Africa  Chad s highest peak is the Emi Koussi in the Sahara  and N Djamena   formerly Fort Lamy   the capital  is the largest city  Chad is home to over 200 different ethnic and linguistic groups  Arabic and French are the official languages  Islam and Christianity are the most widely practised religions  Beginning in the 7th millennium BC  human populations moved into the Chadian basin in great numbers  By the end of the 1st millennium BC  a series of states and empires rose and fell in Chad s Sahelian strip  each focused on controlling the trans Saharan trade routes that passed through the region  France conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of French Equatorial Africa  In 1960  Chad obtained independence under the leadership of Fran ois Tombalbaye  Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the eruption of a long lasting civil war in 1965  In 1979  the rebels conquered the capital and put an end to the south s hegemony  However  the rebel commanders fought amongst themselves until Hiss ne Habr  defeated his rivals  He was overthrown in 1990 by his general Idriss D by  Recently when    the Darfur crisis in Sudan has spilt over the border and destabilised the nation  with hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees living in and around camps in eastern Chad  While many political parties are active  power lies firmly in the hands of President D by and his political party  the Patriotic Salvation Movement  Chad remains plagued by political violence and recurrent attempted coups d  tat  see Battle of N Djamena  2006  and Battle of N Djamena  2008    Chad is one of the poorest and most corrupt countries in the world  most inhabitants live in poverty as subsistence herders and farmers  Since 2003  crude oil has become the country s primary source of export earnings  superseding the traditional cotton industry  Chad is considered a failed state by the Fund for Peace  3

Chadian territory favored human settlement  and the region experienced a strong population increase  Some of the most important African archaeological sites are found in Chad  mainly in the Borkou Ennedi Tibesti Region  some date to earlier than 2000 BC  4  5  For more than 2000 years  the Chadian Basin has been inhabited by agricultural and sedentary peoples  The region became a crossroads of civilizations  The earliest of these were the legendary Sao  known from artifacts and oral histories  The Sao fell to the Kanem Empire  6  7  the first and longest lasting of the empires that developed in Chad s Sahelian strip by the end of the 1st millennium AD  The power of Kanem and its successors was based on control of the trans Saharan trade routes that passed through the region  5  These states  at least tacitly Muslim  never extended their control to the southern grasslands except to raid for slaves  8  Group of Kanem Bu warriors  The Kanem Bornu Empire controlled almost all of what is today Chad  15 000 Chadian soldiers fought for Free France during World War II  9  French colonial expansion led to the creation of the Territoire Militaire des Pays et Protectorats du Tchad in 1900  By 1920  France had secured full control of the colony and incorporated it as part of French Equatorial Africa  10 French rule in Chad was characterised by an absence of policies to unify the territory and sluggish modernisation  The French primarily viewed the colony as an unimportant source of untrained labour and raw cotton  France introduced large scale cotton production in 1929  The colonial administration in Chad was critically understaffed and had to rely on the dregs of the French civil service  Only the south was governed effectively  French presence in the north and east was nominal  The educational system suffered from this neglect  5  11  After World War II  France granted Chad the status of overseas territory and its inhabitants the right to elect representatives to the French National Assembly and a Chadian assembly  The largest political party was the Chadian Progressive Party  PPT   based in the southern half of the colony  Chad was granted independence on August 11  1960 with the PPT s leader  Fran ois Tombalbaye  as its first president  5  12  13  Two years later  Tombalbaye banned opposition parties and established a one party system  Tombalbaye s autocratic rule and insensitive mismanagement exacerbated interethnic tensions  In 1965 Muslims began a civil war  Tombalbaye was overthrown and killed in 1975  14  but the insurgency continued  In 1979 the rebel factions conquered the capital  and all central authority in the country collapsed  Armed factions  many from the north s rebellion  contended for power  15  16  The disintegration of Chad caused the collapse of France s position in the country  Libya moved to fill the power vacuum and became involved in Chad s civil war  17  Libya s adventure ended in disaster in 1987  the French supported president  Hiss ne Habr   evoked a united response from Chadians of a kind never seen before 18  and forced the Libyan army off Chadian soil  19  Habr  consolidated his dictatorship through a power system that relied on corruption and violence  an estimated 40 000 people were killed under his rule  20  21  The president favoured his own Daza ethnic group and discriminated against his former allies  the Zaghawa  His general  Idriss D by  overthrew him in 1990  22  D by attempted to reconcile the rebel groups and reintroduced multiparty politics  Chadians approved a new constitution by referendum  and in 1996  D by easily won a competitive presidential election  He won a second term five years later  23 Oil exploitation began in Chad in 2003  bringing with it hopes that Chad would at last have some chances of peace and prosperity  Instead  internal dissent worsened  and a new civil war broke out  D by unilaterally modified the constitution to remove the two term limit on the presidency  this caused an uproar among the civil society and opposition parties  24  In 2006 D by won a third mandate in elections that the opposition boycotted  Ethnic violence in eastern Chad has increased  the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has warned that a genocide like that in Darfur may yet occur in Chad  25  In 2006 and in 2008 rebel forces have attempted to take the capital by force  but have on both occasions failed  26   edit  Politics and government Main article  Politics of Chad See also  Foreign relations of Chad Chad s constitution provides for a strong executive branch headed by a president who dominates the political system  The president has the power to appoint the prime minister and the cabinet  and exercises considerable influence over appointments of judges  generals  provincial officials and heads of Chad s para statal firms  In cases of grave and immediate threat  the president  in consultation with the National Assembly  may declare a state of emergency  The president is directly elected by popular vote for a five year term  in 2005 constitutional term limits were removed  27  This removal allows a president to remain in power beyond the previous two term limit  27  Most of D by s key advisers are members of the Zaghawa ethnic group  although southern and opposition personalities are represented in government  28  29  Chad is listed as a failed state by the Fund for Peace  FFP   In 2007 Chad had the seventh highest score on the failed state index  Since then the trend has been upwards each year  Chad had the second highest score  behind Somalia  on the Failed State Index of 2011  3  Corruption is rife at all levels  Transparency International s Corruption Perceptions Index for 2005 named Chad the most corrupt country in the world  30  and it has fared only slightly better in the following years  31  In 2007  it scored 1 8 out of 10 on the Corruption Perceptions Index  with 10 being the least corrupt   Only Tonga  Uzbekistan  Haiti  Iraq  Burma  and Somalia scored lower  32  Critics of President D by have accused him of cronyism and tribalism  33  Chad s legal system is based on French civil law and Chadian customary law where the latter does not interfere with public order or constitutional guarantees of equality  Despite the constitution s guarantee of judicial independence  the president names most key judicial officials  The legal system s highest jurisdictions  the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Council  have become fully operational since 2000  The Supreme Court is made up of a chief justice  named by the president  and 15 councillors  appointed for life by the president and the National Assembly  The Constitutional Court is headed by nine judges elected to nine year terms  It has the power to review legislation  treaties and international agreements prior to their adoption  28  29  Embassy of Chad in Washington  D C  The National Assembly makes legislation  The body consists of 155 members elected for four year terms who meet three times per year  The Assembly holds regular sessions twice a year  starting in March and October  and can hold special sessions when called by the prime minister  Deputies elect a National Assembly president every two years  The president must sign or reject newly passed laws within 15 days  The National Assembly must approve the prime minister s plan of government and may force the prime minister to resign through a majority vote of no confidence  However  if the National Assembly rejects the executive branch s programme twice in one year  the president may disband the Assembly and call for new legislative elections  In practice  the president exercises considerable influence over the National Assembly through his party  the Patriotic Salvation Movement  MPS   which holds a large majority  28  Until the legalisation of opposition parties in 1992  D by s MPS was the sole legal party in Chad  28  Since  78 registered political parties have become active  34  In 2005  opposition parties and human rights organisations supported the boycott of the constitutional referendum that allowed D by to stand for re election for a third term 35  amid reports of widespread irregularities in voter registration and government censorship of independent media outlets during the campaign  36  Correspondents judged the 2006 presidential elections a mere formality  as the opposition deemed the polls a farce and boycotted  37  D by faces armed opposition from groups who are deeply divided by leadership clashes but united in their intention to overthrow him  38  These forces stormed the capital on April 13  2006  but were ultimately repelled  Chad s greatest foreign influence is France  which maintains 1 000 troops in the country  D by relies on the French to help repel the rebels  and France gives the Chadian army logistical and intelligence support for fear of a complete collapse of regional stability  39  Nevertheless  Franco Chadian relations were soured by the granting of oil drilling rights to the American Exxon company in 1999  40  Educators face considerable challenges due to the nation s dispersed population and a certain degree of reluctance on the part of parents to send their children to school  Although attendance is compulsory  only 68  of boys attend primary school  and more than half of the population is illiterate  Higher education is provided at the University of N Djamena  28  41   edit  Humanitarian situation Main article  Human rights in Chad According to the United Nations  Chad has been affected by a humanitarian crisis since at least 2001  As of 2008  the country of Chad hosts over 280 000 refugees from the Sudan s Darfur region  over 55 000 from the Central African Republic  as well as over 170 000 internally displaced persons  42  In February 2008 in the aftermath of the battle of N Djamena  UN Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs John Holmes expressed  extreme concern  that the crisis would have a negative effect on the ability of humanitarians to deliver life saving assistance to half a million beneficiaries  most of whom   according to him   heavily rely on humanitarian aid for their survival  43  UN spokesperson Maurizio Giuliano stated to The Washington Post   If we do not manage to provide aid at sufficient levels  the humanitarian crisis might become a humanitarian catastrophe   44   edit  Regions  departments  and sub prefectures Main articles  Regions of Chad  Departments of Chad  and Sub prefectures of Chad Chad has been divided since February 2008 into 22 regions  45  46  The subdivision of Chad in regions came about in 2003 as part of the decentralisation process  when the government abolished the previous 14 prefectures  Each region is headed by a presidentially appointed governor  Prefects administer the 61 departments within the regions  46  The departments are divided into 200 sub prefectures  which are in turn composed of 446 cantons  47  48  The cantons are scheduled to be replaced by communaut s rurales  but the legal and regulatory framework has not yet been completed  49  The constitution provides for decentralised government to compel local populations to play an active role in their own development  50  To this end  the constitution declares that each administrative subdivisions be governed by elected local assemblies  51  but no local elections have taken place  52  and communal elections scheduled for 2005 have been repeatedly postponed  34  Regions of Chad Bol

three distinct zones  the Sudanese savanna in the south  the Sahara Desert in the north  and the Sahelian belt in Chad s center  At 1 284 000 square kilometres  496 000 sq mi   Chad is the world s 21st largest country  It is slightly smaller than Peru and slightly larger than South Africa  53  54  Chad is in north central Africa  lying between latitudes 7  and 24 N  and 13  and 24 E  Chad is bounded to the north by Libya  to the east by Sudan  to the west by Niger  Nigeria and Cameroon  and to the south by the Central African Republic  The country s capital is 1 060 kilometres  660 mi  from the nearest seaport Douala  Cameroon  41  55  Due to this distance from the sea and the country s largely desert climate  Chad is sometimes referred to as the  Dead Heart of Africa   56  The dominant physical structure is a wide basin bounded to the north  east and south by mountain ranges such as the Ennedi Plateau in the north east  Lake Chad  after which the country is named  is the remains of an immense lake that occupied 330 000 square kilometres  130 000 sq mi  of the Chad Basin 7 000 years ago  Lake Chad in a 2001 satellite image  On the top  the changes from 1973 to 1997 are shown   41  Although in the 21st century it covers only 17 806 square kilometres  6 875 sq mi   and its surface area is subject to heavy seasonal fluctuations  57  the lake is Africa s second largest wetland  58  The Emi Koussi  a dormant volcano in the Tibesti Mountains that reaches 3 414 metres  11 201 ft  above sea level  is the highest point in Chad and the Sahara  The region s tall grasses and extensive marshes make it favourable for birds  reptiles  and large mammals  Chad s major rivers the Chari  Logone and their tributaries flow through the southern savannas from the southeast into Lake Chad  41  59   edit  Climate Main article  Climate of Chad Each year a tropical weather system known as the intertropical front crosses Chad from south to north  bringing a wet season that lasts from May to October in the south  and from June to September in the Sahel  60  Variations in local rainfall create three major geographical zones  The Sahara lies in the country s northern third  Yearly precipitations throughout this belt are under 50 millimetres  2 0 in   only the occasional spontaneous palm grove survives  and the only ones to do so are south of the Tropic of Cancer  The Sahara gives way to a Sahelian belt in Chad s centre  precipitation there varies from 300 to 600 mm  11 8 to 23 6 in  per year  In the Sahel  a steppe of thorny bushes  mostly acacias  gradually gives way to the south to East Sudanian savanna in Chad s Sudanese zone  Yearly rainfall in this belt is over 900 mm  35 4 in   55   edit  Economy and infrastructure Main article  Economy of Chad A Chadian maternity ward  Although improving  Chad s infrastructure remains far less developed than that of its northern neighbours  The United Nations  Human Development Index ranks Chad as the seventh poorest country in the world  with 80  of the population living below the poverty line  The GDP  Purchasing power parity  per capita was estimated as US 1 600 in 2008  61  Chad is part of the Bank of Central African States  the Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa  UDEAC  and the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa  OHADA   62  Its currency is the CFA franc  Years of civil war have scared away foreign investors  those who left Chad between 1979 and 1982 have only recently begun to regain confidence in the country s future  In 2000 major direct foreign investment in the oil sector began  boosting the country s economic prospects  53  28  Women in Mao  where water is provided by a water tower  Access to clean water is often a problem in Chad  Over 80  of Chad s population relies on subsistence farming and livestock raising for its livelihood  53  The crops grown and the locations of herds are determined by the local climate  In the southernmost 10 percent of the territory lies the nation s most fertile cropland  with rich yields of sorghum and millet  In the Sahel only the hardier varieties of millet grow  and these with much lower yields than in the south  On the other hand  the Sahel is ideal pastureland for large herds of commercial cattle and for goats  sheep  donkeys and horses  The Sahara s scattered oases support only some dates and legumes  5  Before the development of oil industry  cotton dominated industry and the labour market and accounted for approximately 80  of export earnings  63  Cotton remains a primary export  although exact figures are not available  Rehabilitation of Cotontchad  a major cotton company that suffered from a decline in world cotton prices  has been financed by France  the Netherlands  the European Union  and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development  IBRD   The parastatal is now expected to be privatised  28  ExxonMobil leads a consortium of Chevron and Petronas that has invested  3 7 billion to develop oil reserves estimated at one billion barrels in southern Chad  Oil production began in 2003 with the completion of a pipeline  financed in part by the World Bank  that links the southern oilfields to terminals on the Atlantic coast of Cameroon  As a condition of its assistance  the World Bank insisted that 80  of oil revenues be spent on development projects  In January 2006 the World Bank suspended its loan programme when the Chadian government passed laws reducing this amount  28  52  On July 14  2006  the World Bank and Chad signed a memorandum of understanding under which the Government of Chad commits 70  of its spending to priority poverty reduction programmes  64  A bridge on the Bragoto River Civil war crippled the development of transport infrastructure  in 1987  Chad had only 30 kilometres  19 mi  of paved roads  Successive road rehabilitation projects improved the network 65  to 550 kilometres  340 mi  by 2004  66  Nevertheless  the road network is limited  roads are often unusable for several months of the year  With no railways of its own  Chad depends heavily on Cameroon s rail system for the transport of Chadian exports and imports to and from the seaport of Douala  67  Airplane landing in Ab ch   Tchad An international airport serves the capital and provides regular direct flights to Paris and several African cities  The telecommunication system is basic and expensive  with fixed telephone services provided by the state telephone company SotelTchad  Only 14 000 fixed telephone lines serve all of Chad  one of the lowest telephone density rates in the world  Chad s energy sector has suffered from years of mismanagement by the parastatal Chad Water and Electric Society  STEE   which provides power for 15  of the capital s citizens and covers only 1 5  of the national population  68  Most Chadians burn biomass fuels such as wood and animal manure for power  69  Chad s cities face serious difficulties of municipal infrastructure  only 48  of urban residents have access to potable water and only 2  to basic sanitation  41  70  The country s television audience is limited to N Djamena  The only television station is the state owned TeleTchad  Radio has a far greater reach  with 13 private radio stations  Newspapers are limited in quantity and distribution  and circulation figures are small due to transportation costs  low literacy rates  and poverty  69  71  While the constitution defends liberty of expression  the government has regularly restricted this right  and at the end of 2006 began to enact a system of prior censorship on the media  72   edit  Demographics Main articles  Demographics of Chad and Languages of Chad 2005 estimates place Chad s population at 10 146 000  25 8  live in urban areas and 74 8  in rural ones  73  The country s population is young  an estimated 47 3  is under 15  The birth rate is estimated at 42 35 births per 1 000 people  the mortality rate at 16 69  The life expectancy is 47 2 years  53  A Ouaddaian girl Chad s population is unevenly distributed  Density is 0 1  km2  0 26  sq mi  in the Saharan Borkou Ennedi Tibesti Region but 52 4  km2  136  sq mi  in the Logone Occidental Region  In the capital  it is even higher  55  About half of the nation s population lives in the southern fifth of its territory  making this the most densely populated region  74  Urban life is virtually restricted to the capital  whose population is mostly engaged in commerce  The other major towns are Sarh  Moundou  Ab ch  and Doba  which are less urbanised but are growing rapidly and joining the capital as decisive factors in economic growth  41  Since 2003  230 000 Sudanese refugees have fled to eastern Chad from war ridden Darfur  With the 172 000 Chadians 75  displaced by the civil war in the east  this has generated increased tensions among the region s communities  76  Polygamy is common  with 39  of women living in such unions  This is sanctioned by law  which automatically permits polygamy unless spouses specify that this is unacceptable upon marriage  77  Although violence against women is prohibited  domestic violence is common  Female genital mutilation is prohibited  but the practice is widespread and deeply rooted in tradition  45  of Chadian women undergo the procedure  with the highest rates among Arabs  Hadjarai  and Ouaddaians  90  or more   Lower percentages were reported among the Sara  38   and the Toubou  2    Women lack equal opportunities in education and training  making it difficult for them to compete for the relatively few formal sector jobs  Although property and inheritance laws based on the French code do not discriminate against women  local leaders adjudicate most inheritance cases in favour of men  according to traditional practice  34  A tribal delegation Chad has more than 200 distinct ethnic groups  28  which create diverse social structures  The colonial administration and independent governments have attempted to impose a national society  but for most Chadians the local or regional society remains the most important influence outside the immediate family  Nevertheless  Chad s peoples may be classified according to the geographical region in which they live  In the south live sedentary people such as the Sara  the nation s main ethnic group  whose essential social unit is the lineage  In the Sahel sedentary peoples live side by side with nomadic ones  such as the Arabs  the country s second major ethnic group  The north is inhabited by nomads  mostly Toubous  5  41  The nation s official business languages are French and Arabic  but over 100 languages and dialects are spoken  Due to the important role played by itinerant Arab traders and settled merchants in local communities  Chadian Arabic has become a lingua franca  5   edit  Religion Main article  Religion in Chad Chad is a religiously diverse country  The 1993 census found that 54  of Chadians were Muslim  20  Roman Catholic  14  Protestant  10  animist  and 3  atheist  55  None of these religious traditions are monolithic  Animism includes a variety of ancestor and place oriented religions whose expression is highly specific  Islam is expressed in diverse ways  Christianity arrived in Chad with the French and American missionaries  as with Chadian Islam  it syncretises aspects of pre Christian religious beliefs  5  Muslims are largely concentrated in northern and eastern Chad  and animists and Christians live primarily in southern Chad and Gu ra  41  The constitution provides for a secular state and guarantees religious freedom  different religious communities generally co exist without problems  78  Religion in Chad 1  religion percent Islam    53  Christianity    34  Animism    10  Atheism    3  The vast majority of Muslims in the country are adherents of a moderate branch of mystical Islam  Sufism  known locally as Tijaniyah  which incorporates some local African religious elements  A small minority of the country s Muslims hold more fundamentalist practices  which  in some cases  may be associated with Saudi oriented Salafi movement  Roman Catholics represent the largest Christian denomination in the country  Most Protestants  including the Nigeria based  Winners Chapel   are affiliated with various evangelical Christian groups  Members of the Bah    and Jehovah s Witnesses religious communities also are present in the country  Both faiths were introduced after independence in 1960 and therefore are considered to be  new  religions in the country  Chad is home to foreign missionaries representing both Christian and Islamic groups  Itinerant Muslim preachers primarily from Sudan  Saudi Arabia  and Pakistan  also visit  Saudi Arabian funding generally supports social and educational projects and extensive mosque construction  79   edit  Culture Holidays 68  Date English Name January 1 New Year s Day May 1 Labour Day May 25 African Liberation Day August 11 Independence Day November 1 All Saints  Day November 28 Republic Day December 1 Freedom and Democracy Day December 25 Christmas Because of its great variety of peoples and languages  Chad possesses a rich cultural heritage  The Chadian government has actively promoted Chadian culture and national traditions by opening the Chad National Museum and the Chad Cultural Centre  41  Six national holidays are observed throughout the year  and movable holidays include the Christian holiday of Easter Monday and the Muslim holidays of Eid ul Fitr  Eid ul Adha  and Eid Milad Nnabi  68  The music of Chad includes a number of unusual instruments such as the kinde  a type of bow harp  the kakaki  a long tin horn  and the hu hu  a stringed instrument that uses calabashes as loudspeakers  Other instruments and their combinations are more linked to specific ethnic groups  the Sara prefer whistles  balafones  harps and kodjo drums  and the Kanembu combine the sounds of drums with those of flute like instruments  80  A Chadian tailor sells traditional dresses  The music group Chari Jazz formed in 1964 and initiated Chad s modern music scene  Later  more renowned groups such as African Melody and International Challal attempted to mix modernity and tradition  Popular groups such as Tibesti have clung faster to their heritage by drawing on sai  a traditional style of music from southern Chad  The people of Chad have customarily disdained modern music  However  in 1995 greater interest has developed and fostered the distribution of CDs and audio cassettes featuring Chadian artists  Piracy and a lack of legal protections for artists  rights remain problems to further development of the Chadian music industry  80  81  Millet is the staple food throughout Chad  It is used to make balls of paste that are dipped in sauces  In the north this dish is known as alysh  in the south  as biya  Fish is popular  which is generally prepared and sold either as salanga  sun dried and lightly smoked Alestes and Hydrocynus  or as banda  smoked larger fish   82 Carcaje is a popular sweet drink extracted from hibiscus leaves  Alcoholic beverages  though absent in the north  are popular in the south  where people drink millet beer  known as billi billi when brewed from red millet and as coshate when from white millet  80  As in other Sahelian countries  literature in Chad has suffered from an economic  political and spiritual drought that has affected its best known writers  Chadian authors have been forced to write from exile or expatriate status and have generated literature dominated by themes of political oppression and historical discourse  Since 1962  20 Chadian authors have written some 60 works of fiction  Among the most internationally renowned writers are Joseph Brahim Se d  Baba Moustapha  Antoine Bangui and Koulsy Lamko  In 2003 Chad s sole literary critic  Ahmat Taboye  published his Anthologie de la litt rature tchadienne to further knowledge of Chad s literature internationally and among youth and to make up for Chad s lack of publishing houses and promotional structure  80  83  84  The development of a Chadian film industry has suffered from the devastations of civil war and from the lack of cinemas  of which there is only one in the whole country  The first Chadian feature film  the docudrama
