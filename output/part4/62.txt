Preview Center  at their adjacent Florida theme park  Opening 2 years before the new theme park  the Preview Center was designed to give guests a sneak peek at some of the themes and attractions for Islands of Adventure  The attraction was located in the Paradise Theater building located in the New York section of Universal Studios Florida  next to the Kongfrontation attraction  In the attraction  guests would walk through various rooms themed to the various  Islands  in the new park  The final room stated when the Islands of Adventure park would open  and showed guests Universal s future plans for the Universal Orlando Resort  The Preview Center was closed shortly after the opening of Islands of Adventure  2   edit  Opening Islands of Adventure had a soft opening beginning March 27  1999 3  during which visitors could preview the park at a discounted price while the staff conducted a technical rehearsal and worked on the  finishing touches   During this soft opening  guests were informed that attractions might open and close throughout the day without notice and that some attractions might not be open at all  Initial plans were to open the park in mid May  but this was ultimately delayed until May 28  1999  4  5  After the enormous capital expenditure required to build Islands of Adventure  CityWalk  and the resort hotels  Universal sought to overtake nearby Walt Disney World in attendance  However  with the addition of the second park  new resorts  and entertainment district  the resort was named Universal Studios Escape  Essentially  it seemed that visitors were confused by the name  assuming that Islands of Adventure was a new area added to the already existing Universal Studios Florida theme park  For the first two years  attendance did not rise as expected  6  By 2001  the marketing was re vamped  clarifying that Islands of Adventure was indeed a second  completely separate park with new rides and attractions  Universal Studios Escape was renamed Universal Orlando Resort  and ended up being the only resort in the Orlando area to actually have an increase in attendance after the September 11 attacks on the United States   edit  Timeline
