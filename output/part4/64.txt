Dubai  Arabic        Dubeii  IPA   du beii   English pronunciation   du  ba   doo BY  is a sovereign state known as the emirate in the United Arab Emirates  UAE   A city within the emirate is also named Dubai  The emirate is located south of the Persian Gulf on the Arabian Peninsula and has the largest population with the second largest land territory by area of all the emirates  after Abu Dhabi  4  Dubai and Abu Dhabi are the only two emirates to have veto power over critical matters of national importance in the country s legislature  5  Dubai City is located on the emirate s northern coastline  The earliest mention of Dubai is in 1095  and the earliest settlement known as Dubai town dates from 1799  Dubai was formally established in 1833 by Sheikh Maktoum bin Buti al Maktoum when he persuaded 800 members of the Bani Yas tribe  living in what is now part of Saudi Arabia  to follow him to the Dubai Creek by the Al Abu Falasa clan of Bani Yas  It remained under clan control when the United Kingdom assumed the protection of Dubai in 1892  6  Its geographical location made it an important trading hub and by the beginning of the 20th century  it was an important port  In 1966  oil was discovered  Dubai and the emirate of Qatar set up a new monetary unit to replace the Gulf Rupee  The oil economy led to a massive influx of foreign workers  quickly expanding the city by 300  and bringing in international oil interests  The modern emirate of Dubai was created after the UK left the area in 1971  At this time Dubai  together with Abu Dhabi and four other emirates  formed the United Arab Emirates  The following year Ras al Khaimah joined the federation while Qatar and Bahrain chose to remain independent nations  In 1973  the monetary union with Qatar was dissolved and the UAE Dirham introduced throughout the UAE  A free trade zone was built around the Jebel Ali port in 1979  allowing foreign companies unrestricted import of labor and export capital  The Gulf War of 1990 had a negative financial effect on the city  as depositors withdrew their money and traders withdrew their trade  but subsequently the city recovered in a changing political climate and thrived  Today  Dubai City has emerged as a global city and a business hub  7  Although Dubai s economy was built on the oil industry  the emirate s model of business drives its economy  with the effect that its main revenues are now from tourism  real estate  and financial services  similar to that of Western countries  8  9  10  Dubai has recently attracted world attention through many innovative large construction projects and sports events  This increased attention has highlighted labour rights and human rights issues concerning its largely South Asian workforce  11  Almost half the population of Dubai comprises Indians  Dubai s property market experienced a major deterioration in 2008 and 2009 as a result of the worldwide economic downturn following the financial crisis of 2007 2010  12

Dubai was referred to as Al Wasl by British historians  Few records pertaining to the cultural history of the UAE or its constituent emirates exist and because of the region s oral traditions  folklore and myth were not written down  The linguistic origins of the word Dubai are disputed  some believe it to have originated from the Persian language  while some believe that Arabic is its linguistic root  According to Fedel Handhal  a researcher in the history and culture of the UAE  the word Dubai may have come from the word Daba  a derivative of Yadub  which means to creep   referring to the slow flow of Dubai Creek inland  The poet and scholar Ahmad Mohammad Obaid traces it to the same word  but to its alternative meaning of locust  13   edit  History Main article  History of Dubai Although stone tools have been found at many sites  little is known about UAE s early inhabitants as only a few settlements have been found  14  Many ancient towns in the area were trading centers between the Eastern and Western worlds  The remnants of an ancient mangrove swamp  dated at 7 000 BC  were discovered during the construction of sewer lines near Dubai Internet City  The area was covered with sand about 5 000 years ago as the coast retreated inland  becoming a part of the city s present coastline  14  15  Pre Islamic ceramics have been found from the 3rd and 4th century  16  Prior to Islam  the people in this region worshiped Bajir  or Bajar   16  The Byzantine and Sassanian  Persian  empires constituted the great powers of the period  with the Sassanians controlling much of the region  After the spread of Islam in the area  the Umayyad Caliph  of the eastern Islamic world  invaded south east Arabia and drove out the Sassanians  Excavations by the Dubai Museum in the region of Al Jumayra  Jumeirah  found several artifacts from the Umayyad period  17  Al Fahidi Fort  built in 1799  is the oldest existing building in Dubai   now part of the Dubai Museum The earliest recorded mention of Dubai is in 1095  in the  Book of Geography  by the Andalusian Arab geographer Abu Abdullah al Bakri  The Venetian pearl merchant Gaspero Balbi visited the area in 1580 and mentioned Dubai  Dibei  for its pearling industry  17  Since 1799  there has been a settlement known as Dubai town  18  In the early 19th century  the Al Abu Falasa clan  House of Al Falasi  of Bani Yas clan established Dubai  which remained a dependent of Abu Dhabi until 1833  19  On 8 January 1820  the sheikh of Dubai and other sheikhs in the region signed the  General Maritime Peace Treaty  with the British government  14  In 1833  following tribal feuding  the Al Maktoum dynasty  also descendants of the House of Al Falasi  of the Bani Yas tribe left their ancestral home of the Liwa Oasis  South west of the settlement of Abu Dhabi and quickly took over Dubai from the Abu Fasala clan without resistance  19  The Al Ras district in Deira  Dubai in the 1960s Wind Towers in Dubai Dubai came under the protection of the United Kingdom by the  Exclusive Agreement  of 1892  in which the UK agreed to protect Dubai against the Ottoman Empire  19  Two catastrophes struck the town during the 1800s  First  in 1841  a smallpox epidemic broke out in the Bur Dubai locality  forcing residents to relocate east to Deira  Then  in 1894  fire swept through Deira  burning down most homes  20  However  the town s geographical location continued to attract traders and merchants from around the region  The emir of Dubai was keen to attract foreign traders and lowered trade tax brackets  which lured traders away from Sharjah and Bandar Lengeh  the region s main trade hubs at the time  Persian merchants naturally looked across to the Arab shore of the Persian Gulf finally making their homes in Dubai  They continued to trade with Lingah  however  as do many of the dhows in Dubai Creek today  and they named their district Bastakiya  after the Bastak region in southern Persia  20  21  Dubai s geographical proximity to Iran made it an important trade location  The town of Dubai was an important port of call for foreign tradesmen  chiefly those from Iran  many of whom eventually settled in the town  By the beginning of the 20th century  it was an important port  18  Dubai was known for its pearl exports until the 1930s  the pearl trade was damaged irreparably by World War I  and later on by the Great Depression in the 1930s  With the collapse of the pearling industry  Dubai fell into a deep depression and many residents starved or migrated to other parts of the Persian Gulf  14  In the early days since its inception  Dubai was constantly at odds with Abu Dhabi  In 1947  a border dispute between Dubai and Abu Dhabi on the northern sector of their mutual border  escalated into war  22  Arbitration by the British and the creation of a buffer frontier running south eastwards from the coast at Ras Hasian resulted in a temporary cessation of hostilities  23  Electricity  telephone services  and an airport were established in Dubai in the 1950s  when the British moved their local administrative offices there from Sharjah  24  After years of exploration following large finds in neighbouring Abu Dhabi  oil was eventually discovered in Dubai in 1971  albeit in far smaller quantities  after which the town granted concessions to international oil companies  The discovery of oil led to a massive influx of foreign workers  mainly Indians and Pakistanis  Between 1968 and 1975 the city s population grew by over 300   25  On 2 December 1971 Dubai  together with Abu Dhabi and five other emirates  formed the United Arab Emirates after the former protector  Britain  left the Persian Gulf in 1971  26  In 1973  Dubai joined the other emirates to adopt a uniform currency  the UAE dirham  18  In the 1970s  Dubai continued to grow from revenues generated from oil and trade  even as the city saw an influx of immigrants fleeing the Lebanese civil war  27  Border disputes between the emirates continued even after the formation of the UAE  it was only in 1979 that a formal compromise was reached that ended hostilities  28  The Jebel Ali port was established in 1979  Jafza  Jebel Ali Free Zone  was built around the port in 1985 to provide foreign companies unrestricted import of labour and export capital  29  The Gulf War of 1990 had a huge effect on the city  Depositors withdrew massive amounts of money from Dubai banks due to uncertain political conditions in the region  Later in the 1990s many foreign trading communities first from Kuwait  during the Gulf War  and later from Bahrain  during the Shia unrest moved their businesses to Dubai  21  Dubai provided refuelling bases to allied forces at the Jebel Ali free zone during the Gulf War  and again during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq  Large increases in oil prices after the Gulf War encouraged Dubai to continue to focus on free trade and tourism  30   edit  Geography Main

designation due to land reclamation from the sea  Dubai lies directly within the Arabian Desert  However  the topography of Dubai is significantly different from that of the southern portion of the UAE in that much of Dubai s landscape is highlighted by sandy desert patterns  while gravel deserts dominate much of the southern region of the country  31  The sand consists mostly of crushed shell and coral and is fine  clean and white  East of the city  the salt crusted coastal plains  known as sabkha  give way to a north south running line of dunes  Farther east  the dunes grow larger and are tinged red with iron oxide  25  View of Dubai Desert The flat sandy desert gives way to the Western Hajar Mountains  which run alongside Dubai s border with Oman at Hatta  The Western Hajar chain has an arid  jagged and shattered landscape  whose mountains rise to about 1 300 meters in some places  Dubai has no natural river bodies or oases  however  Dubai does have a natural inlet  Dubai Creek  which has been dredged to make it deep enough for large vessels to pass through  Dubai also has multiple gorges and waterholes which dot the base of the Western Al Hajar mountains  A vast sea of sand dunes covers much of southern Dubai  and eventually leads into the desert known as The Empty Quarter  Seismically  Dubai is in a very stable zone the nearest seismic fault line  the Zagros Fault  is 200 km  124 27 mi  from the UAE and is unlikely to have any seismic impact on Dubai  32  Experts also predict that the possibility of a tsunami in the region is minimal because the Persian Gulf waters are not deep enough to trigger a tsunami  32  The Dubai Sharjah Ajman metropolitan area at night The sandy desert surrounding the city supports wild grasses and occasional date palms  Desert hyacinths grow in the sabkha plains east of the city  while acacia and ghaf trees grow in the flat plains within the proximity of the Western Al Hajar mountains  Several indigenous trees such as the date palm and neem as well as imported trees like the eucalypts grow in Dubai s natural parks  The houbara bustard  striped hyena  caracal  desert fox  falcon and Arabian oryx are common in Dubai s desert  Dubai is on the migration path between Europe  Asia and Africa  and more than 320 migratory bird species pass through the emirate in spring and autumn  The waters of Dubai are home to more than 300 species of fish  including the hammour  The typical marine life off the Dubai coast includes tropical Fish  jellyfish  coral  dugong  dolphins  whales and sharks  Various types of turtles can also be found in the area including the Hawksbill turtle and Green Turtle which are listed as endangered species  33  34  Dubai Creek runs northeast southwest through the city  The eastern section of the city forms the locality of Deira and is flanked by the emirate of Sharjah in the east and the town of Al Aweer in the south  The Dubai International Airport is located south of Deira  while the Palm Deira is located north of Deira in the Persian Gulf  Much of Dubai s real estate boom is concentrated to the west of the Dubai Creek  on the Jumeirah coastal belt  Port Rashid  Jebel Ali  Burj Al Arab  the

Alleged labour injustices in Dubai have attracted the attention of various human rights groups  which have tried to persuade the government to become a signatory to two of the International Labour Organization s eight core conventions  which allows for the formation of labour unions  The Dubai government  however  denied any kind of labour injustices and stated that the watchdog s accusations were misguided  53  Towards the end of March 2006  the government announced steps to allow construction unions  UAE labour minister Ali al Kaabi said   Labourers will be allowed to form unions   54  Prostitution  though illegal  is conspicuously present in the emirate because of its very large male female imbalance  Research conducted by the American Center for International Policy Studies

Dubai s urban transformation and to mimic the sail of a boat  Burj Al Arab characterizes itself as the world s only  7 star  property  a designation considered by travel professionals to be hyperbole  All major travel guides and hotel rating systems have a 5 star maximum  which some hotels attempt to out do by ascribing themselves  6 star  status  Yet according to the Burj Al Arab s official site  the hotel is a  5 star deluxe hotel   The Burj Al Arab was built to resemble the sail of a Dhow  a type of Arabian vessel  Its design features a steel exoskeleton wrapped around a reinforced concrete tower  Two wings spread in a V to form a vast mast  while the space between them is enclosed in a massive atrium by a teflon coated fibreglass sail  During the day  the white fabric allows a soft  milky light inside the hotel  whereas a clear  glass front would produce blinding amounts of glare and a constantly increasing temperature  At night  both inside and outside  the fabric is lit by

dumping the effluent into storm drains or behind dunes in the desert  Sewage dumped into storm drains flows directly into the Persian Gulf  near the city s prime swimming beaches  Doctors have warned that tourists using the beaches run the risk of contracting serious illnesses like typhoid and hepatitis  107  Dubai municipality says that it is committed to catching the culprits and has imposed
