Bern as the seat of the federal authorities  The country is situated in western Europe  note 4  where it is bordered by Germany to the north  France to the west  Italy to the south  and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east  Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps  the Swiss Plateau and the Jura  spanning an area of 41 285 km2  15 940 sq mi   While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory  the Swiss population of approximately 7 9 million people is concentrated mostly on the Plateau  where the largest cities are to be found  Among them are the two global cities and economic centres of Zurich and Geneva  The Swiss Confederation has a long history of armed neutrality it has not been in a state of war internationally since 1815 and did not join the United Nations until 2002  It pursues  however  an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace building processes around the world  6  Switzerland is also the birthplace of the Red Cross and home to a large number of international organizations  including the second largest UN office  On the European level  it is a founding member of the European Free Trade Association and is part of the Schengen Area   although it is notably not a member of the European Union  nor the European Economic Area  It has the world s nineteenth largest economy by nominal GDP and the thirty sixth largest by purchasing power parity  It is the twentieth largest exporter and eighteenth largest importer of goods  In nominal terms  Switzerland is one of the richest countries in the world by per capita gross domestic product  with a nominal per capita GDP of  75 835  4  In 2010  Switzerland had the highest wealth per adult  financial and non financial assets  of any country in the world  with  372 692 for each person   7  Zurich and Geneva have respectively been ranked as the cities with the second and third highest quality of life in the world  8  Switzerland comprises three main linguistic and cultural regions  German  French  and Italian  to which the Romansh speaking valleys are added  The Swiss  therefore  though predominantly German speaking  do not form a nation in the sense of a common ethnic or linguistic identity  The strong sense of belonging to the country is founded on the common historical background  shared values  federalism and direct democracy  9  and

containing Switzer  an obsolete term for the Swiss  which was in use during the 16th to 19th centuries  11  The English adjective Swiss is a loan from French Suisse  also in use since the 16th century  The name Switzer is from the Alemannic Schwiizer  in origin an inhabitant of Schwyz and its associated territory  one of the Waldst tten cantons which formed the nucleus of the Old Swiss Confederacy  The toponym itself is first attested in 972  as Old High German Suittes  ultimately perhaps related to suedan  to burn   referring to the area of forest that was burned and cleared to build  12  The name was extended to the area dominated by the canton  and after the Swabian War of 1499 gradually came to be used for the entire Confederation  13  14  The Swiss German name of the country  Schwiiz  is homophonous to that of the canton and the settlement  but distinguished by the use of the definite article  d Schwiiz for the Confederation  15  but simply Schwiiz for the canton and the town   16  The New Latin name Confederatio Helvetica was introduced gradually after the formation of the federal state in 1848  harking back to the Napoleonic Helvetic Republic  appearing on coins from 1879  inscribed on the Federal Palace in 1902 and after 1948 used in the official seal  17  It is derived from the name of the Helvetii  a Gaulish tribe living on the Swiss plateau before the Roman era  Helvetia appears as a national personification of the Swiss confederacy in the 17th century  with a 1672 play by Johann Caspar Weissenbach  18   edit  History Main article  History of Switzerland Switzerland has existed as a state in its present form since the adoption of the Swiss Federal Constitution in 1848  The precursors of Switzerland established a protective alliance at the end of the 13th century  1291   forming a loose confederation of states which persisted for centuries   edit  Early history Main articles  Early history of Switzerland and Switzerland in the Roman era The oldest traces of hominid existence in Switzerland date back about 150 000 years  19  The oldest known farming settlements in Switzerland  which were found at G chlingen  have been dated to around 5300 BC  19  Founded in 44 BC  Augusta Raurica was the first Roman settlement on the Rhine and is now amongst the most important archaeological sites in Switzerland  20  The earliest known cultural tribes of the area were members of the Hallstatt and La T ne cultures  named after the archaeological site of La T ne on the north side of Lake Neuch tel  La T ne culture developed and flourished during the late Iron Age from around 450 BC  19  possibly under some influence from the Greek and Etruscan civilisations  One of the most important tribal groups in the Swiss region was the Helvetii  In 58 BC  at the Battle of Bibracte  Julius Caesar s armies defeated the Helvetii  19  In 15 BC  Tiberius  who was destined to be the second Roman emperor and his brother  Drusus  conquered the Alps  integrating them into the Roman Empire  The area occupied by the Helvetii the namesakes of the later Confoederatio Helvetica first became part of Rome s Gallia Belgica province and then of its Germania Superior province  while the eastern portion of modern Switzerland was integrated into the Roman province of Raetia  In the Early Middle Ages  from the 4th century  the western extent of modern day Switzerland was part of the territory of the Kings of the Burgundians  The Alemanni settled the Swiss plateau in the 5th century and the valleys of the Alps in the 8th century  forming Alemannia  Modern day Switzerland was therefore then divided between the kingdoms of Alemannia and Burgundy  19  The entire region became part of the expanding Frankish Empire in the 6th century  following Clovis I s victory over the Alemanni at Tolbiac in 504 AD  and later Frankish domination of the Burgundians  21  22  Throughout the rest of the 6th  7th and 8th centuries the Swiss regions continued under Frankish hegemony  Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties   But after its extension under Charlemagne  the Frankish empire was divided by the Treaty of Verdun in 843  19  The territories of present day Switzerland became divided into Middle Francia and East Francia until they were reunified under the Holy Roman Empire around 1000 AD  19  By 1200  the Swiss plateau comprised the dominions of the houses of Savoy  Z hringer  Habsburg and Kyburg  19  Some regions  Uri  Schwyz  Unterwalden  later known as Waldst tten  were accorded the Imperial immediacy to grant the empire direct control over the mountain passes  When the Kyburg dynasty fell in 1264 AD  the Habsburgs under King Rudolph I  Holy Roman Emperor in 1273  extended their territory to the eastern Swiss plateau  21   edit  Old Swiss Confederacy Main article  Old Swiss Confederacy Further information  Growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy  Reformation in Switzerland  and Early Modern Switzerland Federal charter of 1291 The Old Swiss Confederacy was an alliance among the valley communities of the central Alps  The Confederacy facilitated management of common interests  free trade  and ensured peace on the important mountain trade routes  The Federal Charter of 1291 agreed between the rural communes of Uri  Schwyz  and Unterwalden is considered the confederacy s founding document  even though similar alliances are likely to have existed decades earlier  23  24  The Old Swiss Confederacy from 1291  dark grey  to the sixteenth century  light grey  and its associates  blue  By 1353  the three original cantons had joined with the cantons of Glarus and Zug and the Lucerne  Zurich and Bern city states to form the  Old Confederacy  of eight states that existed until the end of the 15th century  The expansion led to increased power and wealth for the federation  24  By 1460  the confederates controlled most of the territory south and west of the Rhine to the Alps and the Jura mountains  particularly after victories against the Habsburgs  Battle of Sempach  Battle of N fels   over Charles the Bold of Burgundy during the 1470s  and the success of the Swiss mercenaries  The Swiss victory in the Swabian War against the Swabian League of Emperor Maximilian I in 1499 amounted to de facto independence within the Holy Roman Empire  24  The Old Swiss Confederacy had acquired a reputation of invincibility during these earlier wars  but expansion of the federation suffered a setback in 1515 with the Swiss defeat in the Battle of Marignano  This ended the so called  heroic  epoch of Swiss history  24  The success of Zwingli s Reformation in some cantons led to inter cantonal religious conflicts in 1529 and 1531  Wars of Kappel   It was not until more than one hundred years after these internal wars that  in 1648  under the Peace of Westphalia  European countries recognized Switzerland s independence from the Holy Roman Empire and its neutrality  21  22  During the Early Modern period of Swiss history  the growing authoritarianism of the patriciate families combined with a financial crisis in the wake of the Thirty Years  War led to the Swiss peasant war of 1653  In the background to this struggle  the conflict between Catholic and Protestant cantons persisted  erupting in further violence at the Battles of Villmergen in 1656 and 1712  24   edit  Napoleonic era Main articles  Switzerland in the Napoleonic era  Helvetic Republic  and Act of Mediation The Act of Mediation was Napoleon s attempt at a compromise between the Ancien R gime and a Republic  In 1798  the revolutionary French government conquered Switzerland and imposed a new unified constitution  24  This centralised the government of the country and effectively abolished the cantons and M lhausen and Valtellina valley separated from Switzerland  The new regime  known as the Helvetic Republic  was highly unpopular  It had been imposed by a foreign invading army and destroyed centuries of tradition  making Switzerland nothing more than a French satellite state  The fierce French suppression of the Nidwalden Revolt in September 1798 was an example of the oppressive presence of the French Army and the local population s resistance to the occupation  When war broke out between France and its rivals  Russian and Austrian forces invaded Switzerland  The Swiss refused to fight alongside the French in the name of the Helvetic Republic  In 1803 Napoleon organised a meeting of the leading Swiss politicians from both sides in Paris  The result was the Act of Mediation which largely restored Swiss autonomy and introduced a Confederation of 19 cantons  24  Henceforth much of Swiss politics would concern balancing the cantons  tradition of self rule with the need for a central government  In 1815 the Congress of Vienna fully re established Swiss independence and the European powers agreed to permanently recognise Swiss neutrality  21  22  24  Swiss troops still served foreign governments until 1860 when they fought in the Siege of Gaeta  The treaty also allowed Switzerland to increase its territory  with the admission of the cantons of Valais  Neuch tel and Geneva  Switzerland s borders have not changed since  25   edit  Federal state Main articles  Restoration and Regeneration  Switzerland  and Switzerland as a federal state The first Federal Palace in Bern  1857   One of the three cantons presiding over the Tagsatzung  former legislative and executive council   Bern was chosen as the federal capital in 1848  mainly because of its closeness to the French speaking area  26  The restoration of the power to the patriciate was only temporary  After a period of unrest with repeated violent clashes such as the Z riputsch of 1839  civil war broke out in 1847 when some of the Catholic cantons tried to set up a separate alliance  the Sonderbundskrieg   24  The war lasted for less than a month  causing fewer than 100 casualties  most of which were through friendly fire  However minor the Sonderbundskrieg seems to be when compared with other European riots and wars in the 19th century  it nevertheless had a major impact on both the psychology and the society of the Swiss and of Switzerland  The war convinced most Swiss of the need for unity and strength towards its European neighbours  Swiss people from all strata of society  whether Catholic  Protestant  or from the liberal or conservative current  realised that the cantons would profit more if their economic and religious interests were merged  Thus  while the rest of Europe was plagued by revolutionary uprisings  the Swiss drew up a constitution which provided for a federal layout  much of it inspired by the American example  This constitution provided for a central authority while leaving the cantons the right to self government on local issues  Giving credit to those who favoured the power of the cantons  the Sonderbund Kantone   the national assembly was divided between an upper house  the Swiss Council of States  2 representatives per canton  and a lower house  the National Council of Switzerland  representatives elected from across the country   Referenda were made mandatory for any amendment of this constitution  22  Inauguration in 1882 of the Gotthard Rail Tunnel connecting the southern canton of Ticino  the longest in the world at the time  27  A system of single weights and measures was introduced and in 1850 the Swiss franc became the Swiss single currency  Article 11 of the constitution forbade sending troops to serve abroad  though the Swiss were still obliged to serve Francis II of the Two Sicilies with Swiss Guards present at the Siege of Gaeta in 1860  marking the end of foreign service  An important clause of the constitution was that it could be re written completely if this was deemed necessary  thus enabling it to evolve as a whole rather than being modified one amendment at a time  28  This need soon proved itself when the rise in population and the Industrial Revolution that followed led to calls to modify the constitution accordingly  An early draft was rejected by the population in 1872 but modifications led to its acceptance in 1874  24  It introduced the facultative referendum for laws at the federal level  It also established federal responsibility for defense  trade  and legal matters  In 1891  the constitution was revised with unusually strong elements of direct democracy  which remain unique even today  24   edit  Modern history Main articles  Switzerland during the World Wars and Modern history of Switzerland General Ulrich Wille  Commander in Chief of the Swiss Army during World War I Switzerland was not invaded during either of the world wars  During World War I  Switzerland was home to Vladimir Illych Ulyanov  Lenin  and he remained there until 1917  29  Swiss neutrality was seriously questioned by the Grimm Hoffmann Affair in 1917  but it was short lived  In 1920  Switzerland joined the League of Nations  which was based in Geneva  on the condition that it was exempt from any military requirements  During World War II  detailed invasion plans were drawn up by the Germans  30  but Switzerland was never attacked  24  Switzerland was able to remain independent through a combination of military deterrence  concessions to Germany  and good fortune as larger events during the war delayed an invasion  22  31  Under General Henri Guisan  a massive mobilisation of militia forces was ordered  The Swiss military strategy was changed from one of static defence at the borders to protect the economic heartland  to one of organised long term attrition and withdrawal to strong  well stockpiled positions high in the Alps known as the Reduit  Switzerland was an important base for espionage by both sides in the conflict and often mediated communications between the Axis and Allied powers  31  Switzerland s trade was blockaded by both the Allies and by the Axis  Economic cooperation and extension of credit to the Third Reich varied according to the perceived likelihood of invasion and the availability of other trading partners  Concessions reached a peak after a crucial rail link through Vichy France was severed in 1942  leaving Switzerland completely surrounded by the Axis  Over the course of the war  Switzerland interned over 300 000 refugees 32  and the International Red Cross  based in Geneva  played an important part during the conflict  Strict immigration and asylum policies as well as the financial relationships with Nazi Germany raised controversy  but not until the end of the 20th century  33  Even in the 21st century  some Swiss banks and entities still refused to surrender the assets obtained from victims of Nazi persecution  During the war  the Swiss Air Force engaged aircraft of both sides  shooting down 11 intruding Luftwaffe planes in May and June 1940  then forcing down other intruders after a change of policy following threats from Germany  Over 100 Allied bombers and their crews were interned during the war  During 1944 45  Allied bombers mistakenly bombed a few places in Switzerland  among which were the cities of Schaffhausen  Basel and Zurich  31  After the war  the Swiss government exported credits through the charitable fund known as the Schweizerspende and also donated to the Marshall Plan to help Europe s recovery  efforts that ultimately benefit the Swiss economy  34  Women were granted the right to vote in the first Swiss cantons in 1959  at the federal level in 1971 24  35  and  after resistance  in the last canton Appenzell Innerrhoden  one of only two remaining Landsgemeinde  in 1990  After suffrage at the federal level  women quickly rose in political significance  with the first woman on the seven member Federal Council executive being Elisabeth Kopp  who served from 1984 1989  24  and the first female president being Ruth Dreifuss in 1999  In 2003  by granting the Swiss People s Party a second seat in the governing cabinet  the Parliament altered the coalition which had brought stability to Swiss politics since 1959  Switzerland joined the Council of Europe in 1963  22  In 1979 areas from the canton of Bern attained independence from the Bernese  forming the new canton of Jura  On 18 April 1999 the Swiss population and the cantons voted in favour of a completely revised federal constitution  24  In 2002 Switzerland became a full member of the United Nations  leaving the Vatican City as the last widely recognised state without full UN membership  Switzerland is a founding member of the EFTA  but is not a member of the European Economic Area  An application for membership in the European Union was sent in May 1992  but not advanced since the EEA was rejected in December 1992 24  when Switzerland was the only country to launch a referendum on the EEA  There have since been several referenda on the EU issue  due to a mixed reaction from the population the membership application has been frozen  Nonetheless  Swiss law is gradually being adjusted to conform with that of the EU  and the government has signed a number of bilateral agreements with the European Union  Switzerland  together with Liechtenstein  has been completely surrounded by the EU since Austria s membership in 1995  On 5 June 2005  Swiss voters agreed by a 55  majority to join the Schengen treaty  a result that was regarded by EU commentators as a sign of support by Switzerland  a country that is traditionally perceived as independent and reluctant to enter supranational bodies  22   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of Switzerland Physical map of Switzerland Extending across the north and south side of the Alps  Switzerland encompasses a great diversity of landscapes and climates on a limited area of 41 285 square kilometres  15 940 sq mi   36  The population is about 7 9 million  resulting in an average population density of around 190 people per square kilometre  485 sq mi   36  37  38  The more mountainous southern half of the country is far more sparsely populated than the northern half  36  In the largest Canton of Graub nden  lying entirely in the Alps  population density falls to 27  km   70  sq mi   Contrasted landscapes between the Matterhorn area in the high Alps  the Sanetsch region and the plateau at Lake Lucerne Switzerland lies between latitudes 45  and 48  N  and longitudes 5  and 11  E  It contains three basic topographical areas  the Swiss Alps to the south  the Swiss plateau or middleland  and the Jura mountains on the north  The Alps are a high mountain range running across the central south of the country  comprising about 60  of the country s total area  Among the high valleys of the Swiss Alps many glaciers are found  totalling an area of 1 063 square kilometres  From these originate the headwaters of several major rivers  such as the Rhine  Inn  Ticino and Rhone  which flow in the four cardinal directions into the whole of Europe  The hydrographic network includes several of the largest bodies of freshwater in Central and Western Europe  among which are included Lake Geneva  Lake Constance and Lake Maggiore  Switzerland has more than 1500 lakes  and contains 6  of Europe s stock of fresh water  Lakes and glaciers cover about 6  of the national territory  36  39  40  About a hundred of Switzerland s mountain peaks are close to or higher than 4 000 metres  13 000 ft   41  At 4 634 m  15 203 ft   Monte Rosa is the highest  although the Matterhorn  4 478 m 14 692 ft  is probably the most famous  Both are located within the Pennine Alps in the canton of Valais  The section of the Bernese Alps above the deep glacial Lauterbrunnen valley  containing 72 waterfalls  is well known for the Jungfrau  4 158 m 13 642 ft  and Eiger  and the many picturesque valleys in the region  In the southeast the long Engadin Valley  encompassing the St  Moritz area in canton Graub nden  is also well known  the highest peak in the neighbouring Bernina Alps is Piz Bernina  4 049 m 13 284 ft   42  The more populous northern part of the country  comprising about 30  of the country s total area  is called the Middle Land  It has greater open and hilly landscapes  partly forested  partly open pastures  usually with grazing herds  or vegetables and fruit fields  but it is still hilly  There are large lakes found here and the biggest Swiss cities are in this area of the country  42  The largest lake is Lake Geneva  also called Lac L man in French   in western Switzerland  The Rhone River is both the main input and output of Lake Geneva   edit  Climate Contrasted climates between the most glaciated area in western Eurasia  Aletsch Glacier   43  the cold temperate Jura  Vall e de Joux  and the southern canton of Ticino  Lake Lugano  The Swiss climate is generally temperate  but can vary greatly between the localities  44  45  from glacial conditions on the mountaintops to the often pleasant near Mediterranean climate at Switzerland s southern tip  Summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall so they are ideal for pastures and grazing  The less humid winters in the mountains may see long intervals of stable conditions for weeks  while the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion  during these periods  thus seeing no sun for weeks  A weather phenomenon known as the f hn  with an identical effect to the chinook wind  can occur at all times of the year and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind  bringing air of very low relative humidity to the north of the Alps during rainfall periods on the southern face of the Alps  This works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming wind from the south  Valleys running south to north trigger the best effect  The driest conditions persist in all inner alpine valleys that receive less rain because arriving clouds lose a lot of their content while crossing the mountains before reaching these areas  Large alpine areas such as Graub nden remain drier than pre alpine areas and as in the main valley of the Valais wine grapes are grown there  46  The wettest conditions persist in the high Alps and in the Ticino canton which has much sun yet heavy bursts of rain from time to time  46  Precipitation tends to be spread moderately throughout the year with a peak in summer  Autumn is the driest season  winter receives less precipitation than summer  yet the weather patterns in Switzerland are not in a stable climate system and can be variable from year to year with no strict and predictable periods   edit  Environment Switzerland s ecosystems can be particularly fragile  because of the many delicate valleys separated by high mountains  often forming unique ecologies  The mountainous regions themselves are also vulnerable  with a rich range of plants not found at other altitudes  and experience some pressure from visitors and grazing  The climatic  geological and topographical conditions of the alpine region make for a very fragile ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to climate change  47  48   edit  Politics Main article  Politics of Switzerland The Swiss Federal Council in 2012 with President Eveline Widmer Schlumpf  in the middle  note 5  The Federal Constitution adopted in 1848 is the legal foundation of the modern federal state  It is among the oldest constitutions in the world  49  A new Constitution was adopted in 1999  but did not introduce notable changes to the federal structure  It outlines basic and political rights of individuals and citizen participation in public affairs  divides the powers between the Confederation and the cantons and defines federal jurisdiction and authority  There are three main governing bodies on the federal level  50  the bicameral parliament  legislative   the Federal Council  executive  and the Federal Court  judicial   The Federal Palace  seat of the Federal Assembly and the Federal Council  The Swiss Parliament consists of two houses  the Council of States which has 46 representatives  two from each canton and one from each half canton  who are elected under a system determined by each canton  and the National Council  which consists of 200 members who are elected under a system of proportional representation  depending on the population of each canton  Members of both houses serve for 4 years  When both houses are in joint session  they are known collectively as the Federal Assembly  Through referendums  citizens may challenge any law passed by parliament and through initiatives  introduce amendments to the federal constitution  thus making Switzerland a direct democracy  49  The Federal Council constitutes the federal government  directs the federal administration and serves as collective Head of State  It is a collegial body of seven members  elected for a four year mandate by the Federal Assembly which also exercises oversight over the Council  The President of the Confederation is elected by the Assembly from among the seven members  traditionally in rotation and for a one year term  the President chairs the government and assumes representative functions  However  the president is a primus inter pares with no additional powers  and remains the head of a department within the administration  49  The Swiss government has been a coalition of the four major political parties since 1959  each party having a number of seats that roughly reflects its share of electorate and representation in the federal parliament  The classic distribution of 2 CVP PDC  2 SPS PSS  2 FDP PRD and 1 SVP UDC as it stood from 1959 to 2003 was known as the  magic formula   In the 2007 Federal Council elections the seven seats in the Federal Council were distributed as follows  2 Social Democrats  SPS PSS   2 Liberal Democrats  FDP PRD   2 Swiss People s Party  SVP UDC   note 6  1 Christian Democrats  CVP PDC   The function of the Federal Supreme Court is to hear appeals against rulings of cantonal or federal courts  The judges are elected by the Federal Assembly for six year terms  51   edit  Direct democracy Main article  Voting in Switzerland The Landsgemeinde is an old form of direct democracy  It is still practised in two cantons  52  Swiss citizens are subject to three legal jurisdictions  the commune  canton and federal levels  The 1848 federal constitution defines a system of direct democracy  sometimes called half direct or representative direct democracy since it is aided by the more commonplace institutions of a parliamentary democracy   The instruments of Swiss direct democracy at the federal level  known as civic rights  Volksrechte  droits civiques   include the right to submit a constitutional initiative and a referendum  both of which may overturn parliamentary decisions  49  53  By calling a federal referendum a group of citizens may challenge a law that has been passed by Parliament  if they can gather 50 000 signatures against the law within 100 days  If so  a national vote is scheduled where voters decide by a simple majority whether to accept or reject the law  Eight cantons together can also call a referendum on a federal law  49  Similarly  the federal constitutional initiative allows citizens to put a constitutional amendment to a national vote  if they can get 100 000 voters to sign the proposed amendment within 18 months  note 7  Parliament can supplement the proposed amendment with a counter proposal  with voters having to indicate a preference on the ballot in case both proposals are accepted  Constitutional amendments  whether introduced by initiative or in Parliament  must be accepted by a double majority of both the national popular vote and a majority of the cantonal popular votes  note 8  54  55  56   edit  Administrative divisions Main article  Cantons of Switzerland The Swiss Confederation consists of 26 cantons  49  Valais Ticino

Poland  Henri Guisan was elected as the General in Chief  Because of its neutrality policy  the Swiss army does not currently take part in armed conflicts in other countries  but is part of some peacekeeping missions around the world  Since 2000 the armed forces department has also maintained the Onyx intelligence gathering system to monitor satellite communications  67  Following the end of the Cold War there have been a number of attempts to curb military activity or even abolish the armed forces altogether  A notable referendum on the subject  launched by an anti militarist group  was held on 26 November 1989  It was defeated with about two thirds of the voters against the proposal  68  69  A similar referendum  called for before  but held shortly after  the September 11 attacks in

 the Swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with those of the EU in many ways  in an effort to enhance their international competitiveness  The economy has been growing most recently at around 3  per year  Full EU membership is a long term objective of some in the Swiss government  but there is considerable popular sentiment against this supported by the conservative SVP party  The western French speaking areas and the urban regions of the rest of the country tend to be more pro EU  however with far from any significant share of the population  107  108  The

the Swiss landscape as it did during the previous 2 000 years  This urban sprawl does not only affect the plateau but also the Jura and the Alpine foothills 139  and there are growing concerns about land use  140  However from the beginning of the 21st century  the population growth in urban areas is higher than in the countryside  138  Switzerland has a dense network of cities  where large
