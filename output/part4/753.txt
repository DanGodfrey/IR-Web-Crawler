California  United States and the world s largest and highest valued semiconductor chip maker  based on revenue  4  It is the inventor of the x86 series of microprocessors  the processors found in most personal computers  Intel Corporation  founded on July 18  1968  is a portmanteau of Integrated Electronics  though a common misconception is that  Intel  is from the word intelligence   Intel also makes motherboard chipsets  network interface controllers and integrated circuits  flash memory  graphic chips  embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing  Founded by semiconductor pioneers Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore and widely associated with the executive leadership and vision of Andrew Grove  Intel combines advanced chip design capability with a leading edge manufacturing capability  Though Intel was originally known primarily to engineers and technologists  its  Intel Inside  advertising campaign of the 1990s made it and its Pentium processor household names  Intel was an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips  and this represented the majority of its business until 1981  Although Intel created the world s first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971  it was not until the success of the personal computer  PC  that this became its primary business  During the 1990s  Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry  During this period Intel became the dominant supplier of microprocessors for PCs  and was known for aggressive and sometimes illegal tactics in defense of its market position  particularly against Advanced Micro Devices  AMD   as well as a struggle with Microsoft for control over the direction of the PC industry  5  6  The 2011 rankings of the world s 100 most valuable brands published by Millward Brown Optimor showed the company s brand value at number 58  7  Intel has also begun research in electrical transmission and generation  8  9  Intel has recently introduced a 3 D transistor that may improve performance and energy efficiency  10  Intel will be mass producing this 3 D transistor  called Tri Gate transistors  with their

Santa Clara  CA  USA Intel was founded in Mountain View  California in 1968 by Gordon E  Moore  of  Moore s Law  fame  a chemist and physicist   Robert Noyce  a physicist and co inventor of the integrated circuit   and Arthur Rock  investor and venture capitalist   Moore and Noyce came from Fairchild Semiconductor and were Intel s first two employees  Rock was not an employee  but he was an investor and Chairman of the Board  13  14  The total initial investment in Intel was  2 5 million convertible debentures and  10 000 from Rock  Just 2 years later  Intel completed their initial public offering  IPO   raising  6 8 million   23 50 per share   13  Intel s third employee was Andy Grove  15  a chemical engineer  who later ran the company through much of the 1980s and the high growth 1990s  Moore and Noyce initially wanted to name the company  Moore Noyce   16  The name  however  was a partial homophone for  more noise    an ill suited name for an electronics company  since noise in electronics is usually very undesirable and typically associated with bad interference  Instead they used the name NM Electronics for almost a year  before deciding to call their company Integrated Electronics or  Intel  for short  17  Since  Intel  was already trademarked by the hotel chain Intelco  they had to buy the rights for the name  13  18   edit  Early history At its founding  Intel was distinguished by its ability to make semiconductors  Its first product  in 1969  was the 3101 Schottky TTL bipolar 64 bit static random access memory  SRAM   which was nearly twice as fast as earlier Schottky diode implementations by Fairchild and the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Tsukuba  Japan  19  20  That same year Intel also produced the 3301 Schottky bipolar 1024 bit read only memory  ROM  21  and the first commercial metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor  MOSFET  silicon gate SRAM chip  the 256 bit 1101  13  22  23  Intel s business grew during the 1970s as it expanded and improved its manufacturing processes and produced a wider range of products  still dominated by various memory devices  While Intel created the first commercially available microprocessor  Intel 4004  in 1971 13  and one of the first microcomputers in 1972  24  22  by the early 1980s its business was dominated by dynamic random access memory chips  However  increased competition from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers had  by 1983  dramatically reduced the profitability of this market  and the sudden success of the IBM personal computer convinced then CEO Andrew Grove to shift the company s focus to microprocessors  and to change fundamental aspects of that business model  By the end of the 1980s this decision had proven successful  Buoyed by its fortuitous position as microprocessor supplier to IBM and IBM s competitors within the rapidly growing personal computer market  Intel embarked on a 10 year period of unprecedented growth as the primary  and most profitable  hardware supplier to the PC industry  By launching its Intel Inside marketing campaign in 1991  Intel was able to associate brand loyalty with consumer selection  so that by the end of the 1990s  its line of Pentium processors had become a household name   edit  Slowing demand and challenges to dominance After 2000  growth in demand for high end microprocessors slowed  Competitors  notably AMD  Intel s largest competitor in its primary x86 architecture market   garnered significant market share  initially in low end and mid range processors but ultimately across the product range  and Intel s dominant position in its core market was greatly reduced  25  In the early 2000s then CEO Craig Barrett attempted to diversify the company s business beyond semiconductors  but few of these activities were ultimately successful  Intel had also for a number of years been embroiled in litigation  US law did not initially recognize intellectual property rights related to microprocessor topology  circuit layouts   until the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984  a law sought by Intel and the Semiconductor Industry Association  SIA   26  During the late 1980s and 1990s  after this law was passed  Intel also sued companies that tried to develop competitor chips to the 80386 CPU  27  The lawsuits were noted to significantly burden the competition with legal bills  even if Intel lost the suits  27 Antitrust allegations had been simmering since the early 1990s and had been the cause of one lawsuit against Intel in 1991  In 2004  AMD brought further claims against Intel related to unfair competition  In 2005  AMD brought further claims  In 2005  CEO Paul Otellini reorganized the company to refocus its core processor and chipset business on platforms  enterprise  digital home  digital health  and mobility   This reorganization led to the hiring of over 20 000 employees  citation needed  In September 2006  due to falling profits  the company announced a restructuring that resulted in layoffs of 10 500 employees  about 10 percent of its workforce  by July 2007  citation needed   edit  Regaining of momentum Faced with the need to regain lost marketplace momentum  25  28  Intel unveiled its new product development model to regain its prior technological lead  Known as its  tick tock model   the program was based upon annual alternation of microarchitecture innovation and process innovation  In 2006  Intel produced P6 and NetBurst products with reduced die size  65 nm   A year later it unveiled its Core microarchitecture to widespread critical acclaim  29  the product range was perceived as an exceptional leap in processor performance that at a stroke regained much of its leadership of the field  30  31  In 2008  Intel had another  tick   when it introduced the Penryn microarchitecture  which was 45 nm  Later that year  Intel released a processor with the Nehalem architecture  Nehalem had positive reviews  Intel was not the first microprocessor corporation to do this  For example  around 1996 graphics chip designers nVidia had addressed its own business and marketplace difficulties by adopting a demanding 6 month internal product cycle whose products repeatedly outperformed market expectation   edit  Sale of XScale processor business On June 27  2006  the sale of Intel s XScale assets was announced  Intel agreed to sell the XScale processor business to Marvell Technology Group for an estimated  600 million in cash and the assumption of unspecified liabilities  The move was intended to permit Intel to focus its resources on its core x86 and server businesses  and the acquisition completed on November 9  2006  32   edit  Acquisitions In August 2010  Intel announced two major acquisitions  On August 19  Intel announced that it planned to purchase McAfee  a manufacturer of computer security technology  The purchase price was  7 68 billion  and the companies said that if the deal were approved  new products would be released early in 2011  33  Less than two weeks later  the company announced the acquisition of Infineon Technologies  Wireless Solutions business  34  With the Infineon transaction  Intel plans to use the company s technology in laptops  smart phones  netbooks  tablets and embedded computers in consumer products  eventually integrating its wireless modem into Intel s silicon chips  35  Intel won the European Union regulatory approval for its acquisition of McAfee on January 26  2011  Intel agreed to ensure that rival security firms have access to all necessary information that would allow their products to use Intel s chips and personal computers  36  Following the closure of the McAfee deal  Intel s workforce totals approximately 90 000  including  roughly  12 000 software engineers  37  In March 2011  Intel bought most of the assets of Cairo based SySDSoft  38  In July 2011  Intel announced that it has agreed to acquire Fulcrum Microsystems Inc   a company specializing in network switches   39  The company was previously included on EE Times list of 60 Emerging Startups   39  On October 1  2011  Intel reached a deal to acquire Telmap  an Israeli based navigation software company  The purchase price was not disclosed but Israeli media reports cited a  300 million to  350 million figure  40   edit  Expansions In 2008  Intel spun off key assets of a solar startup business effort to form an independent company  SpectraWatt Inc  However  as of 2011  SpectraWatt has filed for bankruptcy   12  February 2011  The company will build a new microprocessor factory at Chandler  Arizona which is expected to be completed in 2013 at a cost of  5 billion  It will accommodate 4 000 employees  The company produces three quarters of their products in the United States  although three quarters of the revenue come from overseas  41  42  April 2011  Intel Corporation began a pilot project to produce smartphones with ZTE Corporation for China s domestic market  This project is intended to challenge the domination of ARM processors in mobile phones  The smartphone will be based on the Intel Atom processor  43  December 2011  Intel Corporation announced that it reorganized several of its business units in order to form a new mobile and communications group   44  This group will be responsible for the company s smartphone  tablet and wireless efforts and will be headed by Hermann Eul   edit  Product and market history  edit  SRAMS and the microprocessor The company s first products were shift register memory and random access memory integrated circuits  and Intel grew to be a leader in the fiercely competitive DRAM  SRAM  and ROM markets throughout the 1970s  Concurrently  Intel engineers Marcian Hoff  Federico Faggin  Stanley Mazor and Masatoshi Shima invented Intel s first microprocessor  Originally developed for the Japanese company Busicom to replace a number of ASICs in a calculator already produced by Busicom  the Intel 4004 was introduced to the mass market on November 15  1971  though the microprocessor did not become the core of Intel s business until the mid 1980s   Note  Intel is usually given credit with Texas Instruments for the almost simultaneous invention of the microprocessor    edit  From DRAM to microprocessors In 1983  at the dawn of the personal computer era  Intel s profits came under increased pressure from Japanese memory chip manufacturers  and then President Andy Grove drove the company into a focus on microprocessors  Grove described this transition in the book Only the Paranoid Survive  A key element of his plan was the notion  then considered radical  of becoming the single source for successors to the popular 8086 microprocessor  Until then  manufacture of complex integrated circuits was not reliable enough for customers to depend on a single supplier  but Grove began producing processors in three geographically distinct factories  and ceased licensing the chip designs to competitors such as Zilog and AMD  When the PC industry boomed in the late 1980s and 1990s  Intel was one of the primary beneficiaries   edit  Intel  x86 processors  and the IBM PC The die from an Intel 8742  an 8 bit microcontroller that includes a CPU running at 12 MHz  128 bytes of RAM  2048 bytes of EPROM  and I O in the same chip  Despite the ultimate importance of the microprocessor  the 4004 and its successors the 8008 and the 8080 were never major revenue contributors at Intel  As the next processor  the 8086  and its variant the 8088  was completed in 1978  Intel embarked on a major marketing and sales campaign for that chip nicknamed  Operation Crush   and intended to win as many customers for the processor as possible  One design win was the newly created IBM PC division  though the importance of this was not fully realized at the time  IBM introduced its personal computer in 1981  and it was rapidly successful  In 1982  Intel created the 80286 microprocessor  which  two years later  was used in the IBM PC AT  Compaq  the first IBM PC  clone  manufacturer  produced a desktop system based on the faster 80286 processor in 1985 and in 1986 quickly followed with the first 80386 based system  beating IBM and establishing a competitive market for PC compatible systems and setting up Intel as a key component supplier  In 1975 the company had started a project to develop a highly advanced 32 bit microprocessor  finally released in 1981 as the Intel iAPX 432  The project was too ambitious and the processor was never able to meet its performance objectives  and it failed in the marketplace  Intel extended the x86 architecture to 32 bits instead  45  46   edit  386 microprocessor During this period Andrew Grove dramatically redirected the company  closing much of its DRAM business and directing resources to the microprocessor business  Of perhaps greater importance was his decision to  single source  the 386 microprocessor  Prior to this  microprocessor manufacturing was in its infancy  and manufacturing problems frequently reduced or stopped production  interrupting supplies to customers  To mitigate this risk  these customers typically insisted that multiple manufacturers produce chips they could use to ensure a consistent supply  The 8080 and 8086 series microprocessors were produced by several companies  notably AMD  Grove made the decision not to license the 386 design to other manufacturers  instead producing it in three geographically distinct factories in Santa Clara  California  Hillsboro  Oregon  and the Phoenix  Arizona suburb of Chandler  and convincing customers that this would ensure consistent delivery  As the success of Compaq s Deskpro 386 established the 386 as the dominant CPU choice  Intel achieved a position of near exclusive dominance as its supplier  Profits from this funded rapid development of both higher performance chip designs and higher performance manufacturing capabilities  propelling Intel to a position of unquestioned leadership by the early 1990s   edit  486  Pentium  and Itanium Intel introduced the 486 microprocessor in 1989  and in 1990 formally established a second design team  designing the processors code named  P5  and  P6  in parallel and committing to a major new processor every two years  versus the four or more years such designs had previously taken  The P5 was earlier known as  Operation Bicycle  referring to the cycles of the processor  The P5 was introduced in 1993 as the Intel Pentium  substituting a registered trademark name for the former part number  numbers  such as 486  are hard to register as a trademark   The P6 followed in 1995 as the Pentium Pro and improved into the Pentium II in 1997  New architectures were developed alternately in Santa Clara  California and Hillsboro  Oregon  The Santa Clara design team embarked in 1993 on a successor to the x86 architecture  codenamed  P7   The first attempt was dropped a year later  but quickly revived in a cooperative program with Hewlett Packard engineers  though Intel soon took over primary design responsibility  The resulting implementation of the IA 64 64 bit architecture was the Itanium  finally introduced in June 2001  The Itanium s performance running legacy x86 code did not achieve expectations  and it failed to compete effectively with 64 bit extensions to the original x86 architecture  introduced by AMD  named x86 64  although Intel uses the name Intel 64  previously EM64T   As of 2009  Intel continues to develop and deploy the Itanium  The Hillsboro team designed the Willamette processors  code named P67 and P68  which were marketed as the Pentium 4  citation needed   edit  Pentium flaw Main article  Pentium FDIV bug In June 1994  Intel engineers discovered a flaw in the floating point math subsection of the P5 Pentium microprocessor  Under certain data dependent conditions  low order bits of the result of floating point division operations would be incorrect  an error that can quickly compound in floating point operations to much larger errors in subsequent calculations  Intel corrected the error in a future chip revision  but nonetheless declined to disclose it  citation needed  In October 1994  Dr  Thomas Nicely  Professor of Mathematics at Lynchburg College independently discovered the bug  and upon receiving no response from his inquiry to Intel  on October 30 posted a message on the Internet  47  Word of the bug spread quickly on the Internet and then to the industry press  Because the bug was easy to replicate by an average user  there was a sequence of numbers one could enter into the OS calculator to show the error   Intel s statements that it was minor and  not even an erratum  were not accepted by many computer users  During Thanksgiving 1994  The New York Times ran a piece by journalist John Markoff spotlighting the error  Intel changed its position and offered to replace every chip  quickly putting in place a large end user support organization  This resulted in a  500 million charge against Intel s 1994 revenue  Ironically  the  Pentium flaw  incident  Intel s response to it  and the surrounding media coverage propelled Intel from being a technology supplier generally unknown to most computer users to a household name  Dovetailing with an uptick in the  Intel Inside  campaign  the episode is considered to have been a positive event for Intel  changing some of its business practices to be more end user focused and generating substantial public awareness  while avoiding a lasting negative impression  48   edit   Intel Inside  and other 1990s programs During this period  Intel undertook two major supporting programs  The first is widely known  the 1991  Intel Inside  marketing and branding campaign  The idea of ingredient branding was new at the time with only Nutrasweet and a few others making attempts at that  49  This campaign established Intel  which had been a component supplier little known outside the PC industry  as a household name  The second program is little known  Intel s Systems Group began  in the early 1990s  manufacturing PC  motherboards   the main board component of a personal computer  and the one into which the processor  CPU  and memory  RAM  chips are plugged  50  Shortly after  Intel began manufacturing fully configured  white box  systems for the dozens of PC clone companies that rapidly sprang up  citation needed  At its peak in the mid 1990s  Intel manufactured over 15  of all PCs  making it the third largest supplier at the time  citation needed  During the 1990s  Intel s Architecture Lab  IAL  was responsible for many of the hardware innovations of the personal computer  including the PCI Bus  the PCI Express  PCIe  bus  the Universal Serial Bus  USB   Bluetooth wireless interconnect  and the now dominant citation needed  architecture for multiprocessor servers  clarification needed  IAL s software efforts met with a more mixed fate  its video and graphics software was important in the development of software digital video  citation needed  but later its efforts were largely overshadowed by competition from Microsoft  The competition between Intel and Microsoft was revealed in testimony by IAL Vice President Steven McGeady at the Microsoft antitrust trial   edit  Solid state drives  SSD  On September 8  2008  Intel began shipping its first mainstream solid state drives  the X18 M and X25 M with 80GB and 160GB storage capacities  51  These MLC based drives received wide critical acclaim for their superior performance  52  53  54  55  Intel released their SLC based Enterprise X25 E Extreme SSDs on October 15 that same year in capacities of 32GB and 64GB  56  In July 2009  Intel refreshed their X25 M and X18 M lines by moving from a 50 nanometer to a 34 nanometer process  These new drives  dubbed by the press as the X25 M and X18 M G2 57  58   or generation 2   reduced prices by up to 60 percent while offering lower latency and improved performance  59  On February 1  2010  Intel and Micron announced that they were gearing up for production of NAND flash memory using a new 25 nanometer process  60  In March of that same year  Intel entered the budget SSD segment with their X25 V drives with an initial capacity of 40GB  61  The SSD 310  Intel s first mSATA drive was released on December 2010  providing X25 M G2 performance in a much smaller package  62  63  March 2011 saw the introduction of two new SSD lines from Intel  The first  the SSD 510  uses a SATA 6 Gigabit per second interface in order to reach speeds of up to 500 MegaBytes per second  64  The drive  which uses a controller from Marvell  65  was released using 34 nm NAND Flash and came in capacities of 120GB and 250GB  The second product announcement  the SSD 320  is the successor to Intel s earlier X25 M  It uses the new 25 nm process that Intel and Micron announced in 2010  and was released in capacities of 40 GB  80 GB  120 GB  160 GB  300 GB and 600 GB  66  Sequential read performance maxes out at 270 MB s due to the older SATA 3 Gbit s interface  and sequential write performance varies greatly based on the size of the drive with sequential write performance of the 40 GB model peaking at 45 MB s and the 600 GB at 220 MB s  67  Micron and Intel announced that they

parallel computers based on Intel microprocessors connected in hypercube topologies  80  In 1992 the name was changed to the Intel Supercomputing Systems Division  and development of the iWarp architecture was also subsumed  81  The division designed several supercomputer systems  including the Intel iPSC 1  iPSC 2  iPSC 860  Paragon and ASCI Red   edit  Competition  antitrust and espionage See also  AMD v  Intel Two factors combined to end this dominance  the slowing of PC demand growth beginning in 2000 and the rise of the low cost PC  By the end of the 1990s  microprocessor performance had outstripped software demand for that CPU power  Aside from high end server systems and software  demand for which dropped with the end of the  dot com bubble   consumer systems ran

for rapid gains by competitors  notably AMD  This in turn lowered the profitability citation needed  of the processor line and ended an era of unprecedented dominance of the PC hardware by Intel  citation needed  Intel s dominance in the x86 microprocessor market led to numerous charges of antitrust violations over the years  including FTC investigations in both the late 1980s and in 1999  and civil actions such as the 1997 suit by Digital Equipment Corporation  DEC  and a patent suit by Intergraph  Intel s market dominance  at one time when   it controlled over 85  of the market for 32 bit x86 microprocessors  combined with Intel s own hardball legal tactics  such as its infamous 338 patent suit versus PC manufacturers  82  made it an attractive target for litigation  but few of the lawsuits ever amounted to anything  clarification needed  A case of industrial espionage arose in 1995 that involved both Intel and AMD  Bill Gaede  an Argentine formerly employed both at AMD and at Intel s Arizona plant  was arrested for attempting in 1993 to sell the i486 and P5 Pentium designs to AMD and to certain foreign powers  83  Gaede videotaped data from his computer screen at Intel and mailed it to AMD  which immediately alerted Intel and authorities  resulting in Gaede s arrest  Gaede was convicted and sentenced to 33 months in prison in June 1996  84  85   edit  Partnership with Apple For more details on this topic  see Apple Intel transition  On June 6  2005  then Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced that Apple would be transitioning from its long favored PowerPC architecture to the Intel x86 architecture  because the future PowerPC road map was unable to satisfy Apple s needs  The first Macintosh computers containing Intel CPUs were announced on January 10  2006  and Apple

and brand management  edit  Intel Inside Intel has become one of the world s most recognizable computer brands following its long running Intel Inside campaign  The campaign  which started in 1991  was created by Intel marketing manager Dennis Carter  125  The five note jingle was introduced the following year and by its tenth anniversary was being heard in 130 countries around the world  The initial branding agency for the Intel Inside campaign was DahlinSmithWhite Advertising of Salt Lake City  The Intel swirl logo was the work of DahlinSmithWhite art director Steve Grigg under the direction of Intel president and CEO Andy Grove  The Intel Inside advertising campaign sought public brand loyalty and awareness of Intel processors in consumer computers  126  Intel paid some of the advertiser s costs for an ad that used the Intel Inside logo and jingle  127  In 2008  Intel planned to shift the emphasis of its Intel Inside campaign from traditional media such as television and print to newer media such as the Internet  128  Intel required that a minimum of 35  of the money it provided to the companies in its co op program be used for online marketing  128  The Intel 2010

Logos Intel Brand Logos Corporate Logo Date Intel Inside Logo Date Remarks 1968 2005 1991 2003 The original  Intel Inside  logo  It was used both stand alone and with the associated processor brand name  2003 2005 Highly similar Intel Inside logo  but changed to resemble the original Intel logo with lowering of the Intel  e  and changing the typeface  2005 present 2006 2009 Intel phased out the original corporate Intel and Intel Inside logos in favor of a new base Intel logo clearly inspired by the older Intel Inside logo  but omitted the word inside  The typeface was changed to Neo Sans Intel  In some instances the slogan Leap ahead was added to the corporate logo  2009 2011 In 2009  the Intel Inside logos were updated to a horizontal shape with a visual exposure of silicon below the label to help portray the idea that Intel is in the chips inside the computer  The various brand names were used on this basic shape including Core  i3  i5  i7  Atom  Pentium  and Xeon  Other logos included the names Chipset  Server Board  and Workstation Board  2011 present The Intel Inside logos are slightly modified to move the exposed silicon image to the middle of the logo  This also moved the inside word up next to the Intel logo more closely associating them  The product brand name is displayed at the bottom of the logo   edit  Sonic logo The famous D   D   G   D   A  jingle  sonic logo  tag  audio mnemonic  MP3 file of sonic logo  was produced by Musikvergnuegen and written by Walter Werzowa from the Austrian 1980s sampling band Edelweiss  130  The sonic Intel logo has undergone substantial changes in tone since the introduction of the Pentium III  Pentium 4  and Core processors  yet keeps the same jingle   edit  Naming strategy In 2006  Intel expanded its promotion of open specification platforms beyond Centrino  to include the Viiv media center PC and the business desktop Intel vPro  In mid January 2006  Intel announced that they were dropping the long running Pentium name from their processors  The Pentium name was first used to refer to the P5 core Intel processors  Pent refers to the 5 in P5   and was done to circumvent court rulings that prevent the trademarking of a string of numbers  so competitors could not just call their processor the same name  as had been done with the prior 386 and 486 processors  both of which had copies manufactured by IBM and AMD   They phased out the Pentium names from mobile processors first  when the new Yonah chips  branded Core Solo and Core Duo  were released  The desktop processors changed when the Core 2 line of processors were released  By 2009 Intel was using a good better best strategy with Celeron being good  Pentium better  and the Intel Core family representing the best the company has to offer  131  According to spokesman Bill Calder  since 2009  Intel has maintained only the Celeron brand  the Atom brand for netbooks and the vPro lineup for businesses  Since late 2009  Intel s mainstream processors have been called Celeron  Pentium  Core i3  Core i5  and Core i7  in order of performance from lowest to highest  The first generation core products carry a 3 digit name  such as i5 750  and the second generation products carry a 4 digit name  such as the i5 2500  In both cases  a K at the end of it shows that it is an unlocked processor  enabling additional overclocking abilities  for instance  2500K   vPro products will carry the Intel Core i7 vPro processor or the Intel Core i5 vPro processor name  132  In October 2011  Intel started to sell its Core i7 2700K  Sandy Bridge  chip to customers worldwide  133  Beginning in 2010  Centrino  will only be applied to Intel s WiMAX and Wi Fi technologies  it won t be a PC brand anymore  This will be an evolutionary process taking place over time  Intel acknowledges that multiple brands will be in the market including older ones throughout the transition  132   edit  Open source support Intel has a significant participation in the open source communities  For example  in 2006 Intel released MIT licensed X org drivers for their integrated graphic cards of the i965 family of chipsets  Intel released FreeBSD drivers for some networking cards  134  available under a BSD compatible license  which were also ported to OpenBSD  Intel ran the Moblin project until April 23  2009  when they handed the project over to the Linux Foundation  Intel also runs the LessWatts org campaigns  135  However  after the release of the wireless products called Intel Pro Wireless 2100  2200BG 2225BG 2915ABG and 3945ABG in 2005  Intel was criticized for not granting free redistribution rights for the firmware that must be included in the operating system for the wireless devices to operate  136  As a result of this  Intel became a target of campaigns to allow free operating systems to include binary firmware on terms acceptable to the open source community  Linspire Linux creator Michael Robertson outlined the difficult position that Intel was in releasing to open source  as Intel did not want to upset their large customer Microsoft  137 Theo de Raadt of OpenBSD also claimed that Intel is being  an Open Source fraud  after an Intel employee presented a distorted view of the situation on an open source conference  138  In spite of the significant negative attention Intel received as a result of the wireless dealings  the binary firmware still has not gained a license compatible with free software principles   edit  Environmental record In 2003  there were 1 4 tons of carbon tetrachloride measured from one of Intel s many acid scrubbers  However  Intel reported no release of carbon tetrachloride for all of 2003  139  Intel s facility in Rio Rancho  New Mexico overlooks a nearby village  and the hilly contours of its location create a setting for chemical gases heavier than air to move along arroyos and irrigation ditches in that village  Release of chemicals in such an environment reportedly caused adverse effects in both animals and humans  Deceased dogs in the area were found to have high levels of toluene  hexane  ethylbenzene  and xylene isomers in lungs  140  More than 1 580 pounds  720 kg  of VOC were released in June and July 2006  the company stated  141  Intel s environmental performance is published annually in their corporate responsibility report  142   edit  Religious controversy Orthodox Jews have protested against Intel operating in Israel on Saturday  Shabbat  Intel ringed its office with barbed wire before the protest  but there was no violence  143  As of December 2009  the situation has been stable for Intel Israel while some employees reported working overtime on Shabbat   edit  Age discrimination Intel has faced complaints of age discrimination in firing and layoffs  Intel was sued by nine former employees  over allegations that they were laid off because they were over the age of 40  144  A group called FACE Intel  Former and Current Employees of Intel  claims that Intel weeds out older employees  FACE Intel claims that more than 90 percent of people who have been terminated by Intel are over the age of 40  Upside magazine requested data from Intel breaking out its hiring and terminations by age  but the company declined to provide any  145  Intel has denied that age plays any role in Intel s employment practices  146  FACE Intel was founded by Ken Hamidi  who was terminated by Intel in 1995 at the age of 47  145  Hamidi was blocked in a 1999 court decision from using Intel s email system to distribute criticism of the company to employees  147   edit  Competition Further information  Semiconductor sales leaders by year In the 1980s  Intel was among the top ten sellers of semiconductors  10th in 1987  in the world  In 1991

licensing agreement is canceled in the event of an AMD bankruptcy or takeover  149  Some smaller competitors such as VIA and Transmeta produce low power x86 processors for small factor computers and portable equipment   edit  Lawsuits Intel has often been accused by competitors of using legal claims to thwart competition  Intel claims that it is defending its intellectual property  Intel has been plaintiff and defendant in numerous legal actions  In September 2005  Intel filed a response to an AMD lawsuit  150  disputing AMD s claims  and claiming that Intel s business practices are fair and lawful  In a rebuttal  Intel deconstructed AMD s offensive strategy and argued that AMD struggled largely as a result of its own bad business decisions  including underinvestment in essential manufacturing capacity and excessive reliance on contracting out chip foundries  151  Legal analysts predicted the lawsuit would drag on for a number of years  since Intel s initial response indicated its unwillingness to settle with AMD  152  153  In 2008 a court date was finally set  154  but in 2009 Intel settled with a  1 25 billion payout to AMD  see below   155  In October 2006  a Transmeta lawsuit was filed against Intel for patent infringement on computer architecture and power efficiency technologies  156  The lawsuit was settled in October 2007  with Intel agreeing to pay US 150 million initially and US 20 million per year for the next five years  Both companies agreed to drop lawsuits against each other  while Intel was granted a perpetual non exclusive license to use current and future patented Transmeta technologies in its chips for 10 years  157  On November 4  2009  New York s attorney general filed an antitrust lawsuit against Intel Corp  claiming the company used  illegal threats and collusion  to dominate the market for computer microprocessors  On November 12  2009  AMD agreed to drop the antitrust lawsuit against Intel in exchange for  1 25 billion  155  A joint press release published by the two chip makers stated  While the relationship between the two companies has been difficult in the past  this agreement ends the legal disputes and enables the companies to focus all of our efforts on product innovation and development   158  159   edit  Anti competitive allegations See also  AMD v  Intel  edit  Japan In 2005  the local Fair Trade Commission found that Intel violated the Japanese Antimonopoly Act  The commission ordered Intel to eliminate discounts that had discriminated against AMD  To avoid a trial  Intel agreed to comply with the order  160  161  162  163   edit  European Union In July 2007  the European Commission accused Intel of anti competitive practices  mostly against AMD  164  The allegations  going back to 2003  include giving preferential prices to computer makers buying most or all of their chips from Intel  paying computer makers to delay or cancel the launch of products using AMD chips  and providing chips at below standard cost to governments and educational institutions  165  Intel responded that the allegations were unfounded and instead qualified its market behavior as consumer friendly  165  General counsel Bruce Sewell responded that the Commission had misunderstood some factual assumptions as to pricing and manufacturing costs  166  In February 2008  Intel stated that its office in Munich had been raided by European Union regulators  Intel reported that it was cooperating with investigators  167  Intel faced a fine of up to 10  of its annual revenue  if found guilty of stifling competition  168  AMD subsequently launched a website promoting these allegations  169  170  In June 2008  the EU filed new charges against Intel  171  In May 2009  the EU found that Intel had engaged in anti competitive practices and subsequently fined Intel  1 06 billion  US 1 44 billion   a record amount  Intel was found to have paid companies  including Acer  Dell  HP  Lenovo and NEC  172  to exclusively use Intel chips in their products  and therefore harmed other companies including AMD  172  173  174  The European Commission said that Intel had deliberately acted to keep competitors out of the computer chip market and in doing so had made a  serious and sustained violation of the EU s antitrust rules   172  In addition to the fine  Intel was ordered by the Commission to immediately cease all illegal practices  172  Intel has stated that they will appeal against the Commission s verdict  172   edit  South Korea In September 2007  South Korean regulators accused Intel of breaking antitrust law  The investigation began in February 2006  when officials raided Intel s South Korean offices  The company risked a penalty of up to 3  of its annual sales  if found guilty  175  In June 2008  the Fair Trade Commission ordered Intel to pay a fine of US 25 5 million for taking advantage of its dominant position to offer incentives to major Korean PC manufacturers

administrative proceeding against Intel in September 2010  179  180  181  182  In November 2009  following a two year investigation  New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo sued Intel  accusing them of bribery and coercion  claiming that Intel bribed computer makers to buy more of their chips than those of their rivals  and threatened to withdraw these payments if the computer makers were perceived as working too closely with its competitors  Intel has denied these claims  183  On July 22  2010  Dell agreed to a settlement with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  to pay  100M in penalties resulting from charges that Dell did not accurately disclose accounting information to investors  In particular  the SEC charged that from 2002 to 2006  Dell had an agreement with Intel to receive rebates in exchange for not using chips manufactured by AMD  These substantial rebates were not disclosed to investors  but were used to help meet investor expectations regarding the company s financial performance  the SEC said that in the first quarter of 2007 they amounted to 70  of Dell s operating income  Dell eventually did adopt AMD as a secondary supplier in 2006  and Intel subsequently stopped their rebates  causing Dell s financial performance to fall  184  185  186   edit  Market share According to IDC  while Intel still enjoys the most market share in both the overall worldwide PC microprocessor market  79 3   and the mobile PC microprocessor  84 4   in the second quarter of 2011  the numbers decreased by 1 5  and 1 9  compared to the first quarter  187
