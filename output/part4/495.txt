Gold standard From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search For other uses  see Gold standard  disambiguation   Under a gold standard  paper notes are convertible into pre set  fixed quantities of gold  The gold standard is a monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is a fixed weight of gold  There are distinct kinds of gold standard  First  the gold specie standard is a system in which the monetary unit is associated with circulating gold coins  or with the unit of value defined in terms of one particular circulating gold coin in conjunction with subsidiary coinage made from a lesser valuable metal  Similarly  the gold exchange standard typically involves the circulation of only coins made of silver or other metals  but where the authorities guarantee a fixed exchange rate with another country that is on the gold standard  This creates a de facto gold standard  in that the value of the silver coins has a fixed external value in terms of gold that is independent of the inherent silver value  Finally  the gold bullion standard is a system in which gold coins do not circulate  but in which the authorities have agreed to sell gold bullion on demand at a fixed price in exchange for the circulating currency  Gold certificates were used as paper currency in the United States from 1882 to 1933  These certificates were freely convertible into gold coins  No country currently uses the gold standard as the basis of their monetary system  although several hold substantial gold reserves  Contents 1 History 1 1 Beginnings 1 2

universal currency  1  When commodities compete for the role of money  the one that over time loses the least value  takes on the role  2  The use of gold as money dates back thousands of years and the first known gold coins were minted in the kingdom of Lydia in Asia Minor around 610 BC  The first coins minted in China are thought to date around 600 BC  3  During the Middle Ages  the Byzantine gold Solidus  commonly known as the Bezant  circulated throughout Europe and the Mediterranean  But as the Byzantine Empire s economic influence declined  the European world tended to see silver  rather than gold  as the currency of choice  leading to the development of a silver standard  Silver pennies  based on the Roman Denarius  became the staple coin of Britain around the time of King Offa  circa AD 796  and similar coins  including Italian denari  French deniers  and Spanish dineros circulated throughout Europe  Following the Spanish discovery of great silver deposits at Potos  and in Mexico during the 16th century  international trade came to depend on coins such as the Spanish dollar  Maria Theresa thaler  and  in the 1870s  the United States Trade dollar  In modern times the British West Indies was one of the first regions to adopt a gold specie standard  Following Queen Anne s proclamation of 1704  the British West Indies gold standard was a de facto gold standard based on the Spanish gold doubloon coin  In the year 1717  master of the Royal Mint Sir Isaac Newton established a new mint ratio between silver and gold that had the effect of driving silver out of circulation and putting Britain on a gold standard  However  only in 1821  following the introduction of the gold sovereign coin by the new Royal Mint at Tower Hill in the year 1816  was the United Kingdom formally put on a gold specie standard  the first of the great industrial powers  Soon to follow was Canada in 1853  Newfoundland in 1865  and the USA and Germany de jure in 1873  The USA used the Eagle as their unit  and Germany introduced the new gold mark  while Canada adopted a dual system based on both the American Gold Eagle and the British Gold Sovereign  Australia and New Zealand adopted the British gold standard  as did the British West Indies  while Newfoundland was the only British Empire territory to introduce its own gold coin as a standard  Royal Mint branches were established in Sydney  New South Wales  Melbourne  Victoria  and Perth  Western Australia for the purpose of minting gold sovereigns from Australia s rich gold deposits  The crisis of silver currency and bank notes  1750 1870  In the late 18th century  wars and trade with China  which sold to Europe but had little use for European goods  drained silver from the economies of Western Europe and the United States  Coins were struck in smaller and smaller numbers  and there was a proliferation of bank and stock notes used as money  England In the 1790s  England  suffering a massive shortage of silver coinage  ceased to mint larger silver coins and issued  token  silver coins and overstruck foreign coins  With the end of the Napoleonic Wars  England began a massive recoinage programme that created standard gold sovereigns and circulating crowns and half crowns  and eventually copper farthings in 1821  The recoinage of silver in England after a long drought produced a burst of coins  England struck nearly 40 million shillings between 1816 and 1820  17 million half crowns and 1 3 million silver crowns  The 1819 Act for the Resumption of Cash Payments set 1823 as the date for resumption of convertibility  reached instead by 1821  Throughout the 1820s  small notes were issued by regional banks  which were finally restricted in 1826  while the Bank of England was allowed to set up regional branches  In 1833  however  the Bank of England notes were made legal tender  and redemption by other banks was discouraged  In 1844 the Bank Charter Act established that Bank of England Notes  fully backed by gold  were the legal standard  According to the strict interpretation of the gold standard  this 1844 act marks the establishment of a full gold standard for British money  US The US adopted a silver standard based on the Spanish milled dollar in 1785  This was codified in the 1792 Mint and Coinage Act  and by the Federal Government s use of the  Bank of the United States  to hold its reserves  as well as establishing a fixed ratio of gold to the US dollar  This was  in effect  a derivative silver standard  since the bank was not required to keep silver to back all of its currency  This began a long series of attempts for America to create a bi metallic standard for the US Dollar  which would continue until the 1920s  Gold and silver coins were legal tender  including the Spanish real  a silver coin struck in the Western Hemisphere  Because of the huge debt taken on by the US Federal Government to finance the Revolutionary War  silver coins struck by the government left circulation  and in 1806 President Jefferson suspended the minting of silver coins  The US Treasury was put on a strict hard money standard  doing business only in gold or silver coin as part of the Independent Treasury Act of 1848  which legally separated the accounts of the Federal Government from the banking system  However the fixed rate of gold to silver overvalued silver in relation to the demand for gold to trade or borrow from England  The drain of gold in favor of silver led to the search for gold  including the California Gold Rush of 1849  Following Gresham s law  silver poured into the US  which traded with other silver nations  and gold moved out  In 1853  the US reduced the silver weight of coins  to keep them in circulation  and in 1857 removed legal tender status from foreign coinage  In 1857 the final crisis of the free banking era of international finance began  as American banks suspended payment in silver  rippling through the very young international financial system of central banks  In 1861 the US government suspended payment in gold and silver  effectively ending the attempts to form a silver standard basis for the dollar  International Through the 1860 1871 period  various attempts to resurrect bi metallic standards were made  including one based on the gold and silver franc  however  with the rapid influx of silver from new deposits  the expectation of scarcity of silver ended  The interaction between central banking and currency basis formed the primary source of monetary instability during this period  The combination that produced economic stability was a restriction of supply of new notes  a government monopoly on the issuance of notes directly and  indirectly  a central bank and a single unit of value  Attempts to avoid these conditions produced periodic monetary crises  As notes devalued  or silver ceased to circulate as a store of value  or there was a depression as governments  demanding specie as payment  drained the circulating medium out of the economy  At the same time  there was a dramatically expanded need for credit  and large banks were being chartered in various states  including  by 1872  Japan  The need for a solid basis in monetary affairs would produce a rapid acceptance of the gold standard in the period that followed  Japan By way of example  and following Germany s decision after the Franco Prussian War  1870 1871  to extract reparations to facilitate a move to the gold standard  Japan gained the needed reserves after the Sino Japanese War of 1894 1895  Whether the gold standard provided a government sufficient bona fides when it sought to borrow abroad is debated  For Japan  moving to gold was considered vital to gain access to Western capital markets  4  The gold exchange standard  1870 1914  This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Towards the end of the 19th century  some of the remaining silver standard countries began to peg their silver coin units to the gold standards of the United Kingdom or the USA  In 1898  British India pegged the silver rupee to the pound sterling at a fixed rate of 1s 4d  while in 1906  the Straits Settlements adopted a gold exchange standard against the pound sterling with the silver Straits dollar being fixed at 2s 4d  At the turn of the century  the Philippines pegged the silver Peso dollar to the US dollar at 50 cents  A similar pegging at 50 cents occurred at around the same time with the silver Peso of Mexico and the silver Yen of Japan  When Siam adopted a gold exchange standard in 1908  this left only China and Hong Kong on the silver standard  Adopting the gold standard many European nations changed the name of their currency from Rixdaler  Sweden and Denmark  or Gulden  Austria Hungary  to Crown  since the former ones were traditionally associated with silver coins and the latter with gold coins  Impact of World War I  1914 25  Governments faced with the need to fund high levels of expenditure  but with limited sources of tax revenue  suspended convertibility of currency into gold on a number of occasions in the 19th century  The British government suspended convertibility  that is to say  it went off the gold standard  during the Napoleonic wars and the US government during the US Civil War  In both cases  convertibility was resumed after the war  citation needed  The real test  however  came in the form of World War I  a test  it failed utterly  according to economist Richard Lipsey  1  In order to finance the costs of war  most belligerent countries went off the gold standard during the war  and suffered significant inflation  Because inflation levels varied between states  when they returned to the standard after the war at price determined by themselves  some  for example  chose to enter at pre war prices   some countries  goods were undervalued and some overvalued  1  Ultimately  the system as it stood could not deal quickly enough with the large deficits and surpluses created in the balance of payments  this has previously been attributed to increasing rigidity of wages  particularly in terms of wage cuts  brought about by the advent of unionized labor  but is now more likely to be thought of as an inherent fault with the system which came to light under the pressures of war and rapid technological change  In any case  prices had not reached equilibrium by the time of the Great Depression  which served only to kill it off completely  1  For example  Germany had gone off the gold standard in 1914  and could not effectively return to it as Germany had lost much of its remaining gold reserves in reparations  The German central bank issued unbacked marks virtually without limit to buy foreign currency for further reparations and to support workers during the Occupation of the Ruhr finally leading to hyperinflation in the 1920s  The gold bullion standard and the decline of the gold standard  1925 31  This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   August 2011  William McKinley ran for president on the basis of the gold standard  The gold specie standard ended in the United Kingdom and the rest of the British Empire at the outbreak of World War I  Treasury notes replaced the circulation of the gold sovereigns and gold half sovereigns  However  legally  the gold specie standard was not repealed  The end of the gold standard was successfully effected by appeals to patriotism when somebody would request the Bank of England to redeem their paper money for gold specie  It was only in the year 1925 when Britain returned to the gold standard in conjunction with Australia and South Africa that the gold specie standard was officially ended  The British Gold Standard Act 1925 both introduced the gold bullion standard and simultaneously repealed the gold specie standard  The new gold bullion standard did not envisage any return to the circulation of gold specie coins  Instead  the law compelled the authorities to sell gold bullion on demand at a fixed price  but only in the form of bars containing approximately four hundred ounces troy of fine gold  5  This gold bullion standard lasted until 1931 when speculative attacks on the pound forced Britain off the gold standard  6  Loans from American and French Central Banks of  50 000 000  were insufficient and exhausted in a matter of weeks  7  On September 19  1931  the United Kingdom left the revised gold standard  8  forced to suspend the gold bullion standard due to large outflows of gold across the Atlantic Ocean  The British benefited from the departure  They could now use monetary policy to stimulate the economy through the lowering of interest rates  Australia and New Zealand had already been forced off the gold standard by the same pressures connected with the Great Depression  and Canada quickly followed suit with the United Kingdom  The interwar partially backed gold standard was inherently unstable  because of the conflict between  a  the expansion of sterling and dollar liabilities to foreign central banks  and  b  the resulting deterioration in the reserve ratio of the Bank of England  and U S  Treasury and Federal Reserve Banks  9  This instability was enhanced by gold flows out of England  with its overvalued pound  to other countries such as France  which was attempting to make Paris a world class financial center  in competition with London and New York  10  It was destabilizing speculation  emanating from lack of confidence in authorities  commitment to currency convertibility that ended the interwar gold standard  In May 1931 there was a run on Austria s largest commercial bank  and the bank failed  The run spread to Germany  where an important bank also collapsed  The countries  central banks lost substantial reserves  international financial assistance was too late  and in July 1931 Germany adopted exchange control  followed by Austria in October  These countries were definitively off the gold standard  The Austrian and German experiences  as well as British budgetary and political difficulties  were among the factors that destroyed confidence in sterling  which occurred in mid July 1931  Runs on sterling ensued  and the Bank of England lost much of its reserves  Loans from abroad were insufficient  and in any event taken as a sign of weakness  The gold standard was abandoned in September  and the pound quickly and sharply depreciated on the foreign  exchange market  as overvaluation of the pound would imply  11  Depression and World War II  1932 46  Prolongation of the Great Depression Some economic historians  such as American professor Barry Eichengreen  blame the gold standard of the 1920s for prolonging the Great Depression  12  Adherence to the gold standard prevented the Federal Reserve from expanding the money supply in order to stimulate the economy  fund insolvent banks and fund government deficits which could  prime the pump  for an expansion  Once the US went off the gold standard  it became free to engage in such money creation  The gold standard limited the flexibility of the central banks  monetary policy by limiting their ability to expand the money supply  and thus their ability to lower interest rates  In the US  the Federal Reserve was required by law to have 40  gold backing of its Federal Reserve demand notes  and thus  could not expand the money supply beyond what was allowed by the gold reserves held in their vaults  13  Others including Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman place most or all of the blame for the severity of the Great Depression at the feet of the Federal Reserve  mostly due to the deliberate tightening of monetary policy  14  Higher interest rates intensified the deflationary pressure on the dollar and reduced investment in U S  banks  Commercial banks also converted Federal Reserve Notes to gold in 1931  reducing the Federal Reserve s gold reserves  and forcing a corresponding reduction in the amount of Federal Reserve Notes in circulation  15  This speculative attack on the dollar created a panic in the U S  banking system  Fearing imminent devaluation of the dollar  many foreign and domestic depositors withdrew funds from U S  banks to convert them into gold or other assets  15  As people pulled money from the banking system due to bank panics  a reverse multiplier effect caused a contraction in the money supply  16  Additionally the New York Fed had loaned over  150 million  over 240 tons  to European Central Banks to help them out with their difficulties  This transfer of gold out of the US acted to contract the US money supply  These loans became questionable once England  Germany  Austria and other European countries went off the gold standard in 1931 and weakened confidence in the dollar  17  The forced contraction of the money supply caused by people removing funds from the banking system during the bank panics resulted in deflation  and even as nominal interest rates dropped  inflation adjusted real interest rates remained high  rewarding those that held onto money instead of spending it  causing a further slowdown in the economy  18  Recovery in the United States was slower than in Britain  in part due to Congressional reluctance to abandon the gold standard and float the U S  currency as Britain had done  19  In the early 1930s  the Federal Reserve defended the fixed price of dollars in respect to the gold standard by raising interest rates  trying to increase the demand for dollars  Its commitment and adherence to the gold standard explain why the U S  did not engage in expansionary monetary policy  To compete in the international economy  the U S  maintained high interest rates  This helped attract international investors who bought foreign assets with gold  15  Congress passed the Gold Reserve Act on 30 January 1934  the measure nationalized all gold by ordering the Federal Reserve banks to turn over their supply to the U S  Treasury  In return the banks received gold certificates to be used as reserves against deposits and Federal Reserve notes  The act also authorized the president to devalue the gold dollar so that it would have no more than 60 percent of its existing weight  Under this authority the president  on 31 January 1934  changed the value of the dollar from  20 67 to the troy ounce to  35 to the troy ounce  a devaluation of over 40   Other factors in the prolongation of the Great Depression include trade wars and the reduction in international trade caused by trade barriers such as Smoot Hawley Tarriff in the US and the Imperial Preference policies of Great Britain  20  the failure of central banks to act responsibly  21  government policies designed to prevent wages from falling  such as the Davis Bacon Act of 1931  during the deflationary period resulting in production costs dropping slower then sales prices and thereby injuring business profitability  22  and increases in taxes to reduce budget deficits and to support new programs such as Social Security  The US top marginal income tax rate went from 25  to 63  in 1932 and to 79  in 1936 23  while the bottom rate increased over 10 fold from  375  in 1929 to 4  in 1932 24  Successful attacks on partially backed currencies which forced many countries off the gold standard and reduced confidence in the financial system  and a financial system  further damaged by the bank panics of the 1930s were also factors  as was inclement weather such as the drought resulting in the US Dust Bowl  Milton Friedman stated that  the severity of each of the major contractions   1920 1  1929 33 and 1937 8 is directly attributable to acts of commission and omission by the Reserve authorities  25  He further believes that the US got out of the Great Depression because of the  natural resiliency of the economy and WW2  and not due to any acts of government  which in general were  very destructive  and extended the Great Depression  26  Barry Eichengreen believes that the Austrian School view that the Great Depression was the result of a credit bust has much to recommend it  27 Alan Greenspan wrote that the bank failures of the 1930s were sparked by Great Britain dropping the gold standard in 1931  This act  tore asunder  any remaining confidence in the banking system  28  Financial historian Niall Ferguson writes that what made the Great Depression truly  great  was the European banking crisis of 1931  29  British hesitate to return to gold standard During the 1939 1942 period  the UK depleted much of its gold stock in purchases of munitions and weaponry on a  cash and carry  basis from the U S  and other nations  citation needed  This depletion of the UK s reserve convinced Winston Churchill of the impracticality of returning to a pre war style gold standard  John Maynard Keynes  who had argued against such a gold standard  proposed to put the power to print money in the hands of the privately owned Bank of England  Keynes  in warning about the menaces of inflation  said   By a continuous process of inflation  governments can confiscate  secretly and unobserved  an important part of the wealth of their citizens  By this method  they not only confiscate  but they confiscate arbitrarily  and while the process impoverishes many  it actually enriches some   30  Quite possibly because of this  the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement established the International Monetary Fund and an international monetary system based on convertibility of the various national currencies into a U S  dollar that was in turn convertible into gold  Post war international gold dollar standard  1946 1971  Main article  Bretton Woods system After the Second World War  a system similar to a Gold Standard and sometimes described as a  gold exchange standard  was established by the Bretton Woods Agreements  Under this system  many countries fixed their exchange rates relative to the U S  dollar  The U S  promised to fix the price of gold at approximately  35 per ounce  Implicitly  then  all currencies pegged to the dollar also had a fixed value in terms of gold  1  Under the administration of the French President Charles de Gaulle up to 1970  France reduced its dollar reserves  trading them for gold from the U S  government  thereby reducing U S  economic influence abroad  This  along with the fiscal strain of federal expenditures for the Vietnam War and persistent balance of payments deficits  led President Richard Nixon to end the direct convertibility of the dollar to gold on August 15  1971  resulting in the system s breakdown  the  Nixon Shock    Theory Commodity money is inconvenient to store and transport  Further  it does not allow a government to manipulate or restrict the flow of commerce within its dominion with the same ease that a fiat currency does  As such  commodity money gave way to representative money  and gold and other specie were retained as its backing  Gold was a common form of money due to its rarity  durability  divisibility  fungibility  and ease of identification  4  often in conjunction with silver  Silver was typically the main circulating medium  with gold as the metal of monetary reserve  The gold standard variously specified how the gold backing would be implemented  including the amount of specie per currency unit  The currency itself is just paper and so has no intrinsic value  but is accepted by traders because it can be redeemed any time for the equivalent specie  A U S  silver certificate  for example  could be redeemed for an actual piece of silver  Representative money and the gold standard protect citizens from hyperinflation and other abuses of monetary policy  as were seen in some countries during the Great Depression  However  they were not without their problems and critics  and so were partially abandoned via the international adoption of the Bretton Woods System  That system eventually collapsed in 1971  at which time nearly all nations had switched to full fiat money  According to Keynesian analysis  the earliness with which a country left the gold standard reliably predicted its economic recovery from the great depression  For example  Great Britain and Scandinavia  which left the gold standard in 1931  recovered much earlier than France and Belgium  which remained on gold much longer  Countries such as China  which had a silver standard  almost avoided the depression entirely  The connection between leaving the gold standard as a strong predictor of that country s severity of its depression and the length of time of its recovery has been shown to be consistent for dozens of countries  including developing countries  This may explain why the experience and length of the depression differed between national economies  31  Differing definitions A 100  reserve gold standard  or a full gold standard  exists when a monetary authority holds sufficient gold to convert all of the representative money it has issued into gold at the promised exchange rate  It is sometimes referred to as the gold specie standard to more easily identify it from other forms of the gold standard that have existed at various times  Opponents of a 100  reserve standard consider a 100  reserve standard difficult to implement  saying that the quantity of gold in the world is too small to sustain current worldwide economic activity at current gold prices  implementation would entail a many fold increase in the price of gold  citation needed  However  proponents of the gold standard have said that any amount of gold can serve as the reserve   Once a money is established  any stock of money becomes compatible with any amount of employment and real income   32  According to them the prices of goods and services will adjust to the supply of gold  33  In an international gold standard system  which is necessarily based on an internal gold standard in the countries concerned   34  gold or a currency that is convertible into gold at a fixed price is used as a means of making international payments  Under such a system  when exchange rates rise above or fall below the fixed mint rate by more than the cost of shipping gold from one country to another  large inflows or outflows occur until the rates return to the official level  International gold standards often limit which entities have the right to redeem currency for gold  Under the Bretton Woods system  these were called  SDRs  for special drawing rights  citation needed  Advantages Long term price stability has been described as the great virtue of the gold standard  35  The gold standard limits the power of governments to inflate prices through excessive issuance of paper currency  36  Under the gold standard  high levels of inflation are rare  and hyperinflation is nearly impossible as the money supply can only grow at the rate that the gold supply increases  36  Economy wide price increases caused by ever increasing amounts of currency chasing a constant supply of goods are rare  36  as gold supply for monetary use is limited by the available gold that can be minted into coin  36  High levels of inflation under a gold standard are usually seen only when warfare destroys a large part of the economy  reducing the production of goods  or when a major new source of gold becomes available  36  In the U S  one of those periods of warfare was the Civil War  which destroyed the economy of the South  37  while the California Gold Rush made large amounts of gold available for minting  38  Proponents of the gold standard claim that its stability fosters economic prosperity  39  40  The gold standard provides fixed international exchange rates between those countries that have adopted it  and thus reduces uncertainty in international trade  36  Historically  imbalances between price levels in different countries would be partly or wholly offset by an automatic balance of payment adjustment mechanism called the  price specie flow mechanism   36  Gold used to pay for imports reduces the money supply of importing nations  causing deflation and a reduction in the general price level for goods and services  making them more competitive  while the importation of gold by net exporters serves to increase the money supply  causes inflation and an increase in the general price level  making them less competitive  41  The gold standard acts as a check on government deficit spending as it limits the amount of debt that can be issued  It also prevents governments from inflating away the real value of their already existing debt through currency devaluation  42  A central bank cannot be an unlimited buyer of last resort of government debt  A central bank could not create unlimited quantities of money at will  as there is a limited supply of gold  36  A gold standard cannot be used for what some economists call  financial repression  43  Newly printed money can be used to purchase goods and services  and to discharge debts  at no cost to the printer  This acts as a mechanism to transfer the wealth of society to those that can print money  from everyone else  Financial repression is most successful in liquidating debts when accompanied by a steady dose of inflation  and it can be considered a form of taxation  44  45  In 1966 Alan Greenspan wrote  Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth  Gold stands in the way of this insidious process  It stands as a protector of property rights  If one grasps this  one has no difficulty in understanding the statists  antagonism toward the gold standard   46  Per John Maynard Keynes  By a continuing process of inflation  governments can confiscate  secretly and unobserved  an important part of the wealth of their citizens   47  Financial repression negatively affects economic growth  48  The gold standard benefits savers by preventing their savings from being devalued or destroyed through inflation  and by rewarding them with higher real  inflation adjusted  interest rates  In the US and United Kingdom  from 1945 to 1980 negative real interest rates have cost lenders an estimated 3 4  of GDP per year on average  49  The gold standard tends to limit credit booms and the resulting boom bust cycle because of the inelastic supply of money  50  Disadvantages Gold prices  US  per ounce  from 1968 to 2010  in nominal US  and inflation adjusted US   The total amount of gold that has ever been mined has been estimated at around 142 000 metric tons 51  and arguments have been made that this amount is too small to serve as a monetary base  The value of this amount of gold is over 6 trillion dollars while the monetary base of the US  with a roughly 20  share of the world economy  stands at  2 7 trillion at the end of 2011  52  The unequal distribution of gold as a natural resource makes the gold standard much more advantageous in terms of cost and international economic empowerment for those countries that produce gold  53  In 2010 the largest producers of gold  in order  are China  followed by Australia  the US  South Africa and Russia  54  The country with the largest reserves is Australia  55  The gold standard acts as a limit on economic growth  56   As an economy s productive capacity grows  then so should its money supply  Because a gold standard requires that money be backed in the metal  then the scarcity of the metal constrains the ability of the economy to produce more capital and grow   56  Mainstream economists believe that economic recessions can be largely mitigated by increasing money supply during economic downturns  57  Following a gold standard would mean that the amount of money would be determined by the supply of gold  and hence monetary policy could no longer be used to stabilize the economy in times of economic recession  58  Such reason is often employed to partially blame the gold standard for the Great Depression  citing that the Federal Reserve couldn t expand credit enough to offset the deflationary forces at work in the market  59  Although the gold standard has brought long run price stability  it has also historically been associated with high short run price volatility  60  61  It has been argued by  among others  Anna Schwartz  that this kind of instability in short term price levels can lead to financial instability as lenders and borrowers become uncertain about the value of debt  62  Deflation punishes debtors  63  64  Real debt burdens therefore rise  causing borrowers to cut spending to service their debts or to default  Lenders become wealthier  but may choose to save some of their additional wealth rather than spending it all  65  The overall amount of expenditure is therefore likely to fall  65  Monetary policy would essentially be determined by the rate of gold production  66  Fluctuations in the amount of gold that is mined could cause inflation if there is an increase  or deflation if there is a decrease  60  66  Some hold the view that this contributed to the severity and length of the Great Depression as the gold standard forced the central banks to keep monetary policy too tight  creating deflation  67  68  James Hamilton contended that the gold standard may be susceptible to speculative attacks when a government s financial position appears weak  although others contend that this very threat discourages governments  engaging in risky policy  see Moral Hazard   68  For example  some believe that the United States was forced to contract the money supply and raise interest rates in September 1931 to defend the dollar after speculators forced Great Britain off the gold standard 68  69  70  If a country wanted to devalue its currency  a gold standard would generally produce sharper changes than the smooth declines seen in fiat currencies  depending on the method of devaluation  71  Most economists favor a low  positive rate of inflation  Partly this reflects fear of deflationary shocks  but primarily because they believe that central banks still have some role to play in dampening fluctuations in output and unemployment  Central banks can more safely play that role when a positive rate of inflation gives them room to tighten money growth without inducing price declines  72  It is difficult to manipulate a gold standard to tailor to an economy s demand for money  providing practical constraints against the measures that central banks might otherwise use to respond to economic crises  73  The demand for money always equals the supply of money  Creation of new money reduces interest rates and thereby increases demand for new lower cost debt  raising the demand for money  74  Advocates of a renewed gold standard The return to the gold standard is supported by many followers of the Austrian School of Economics  Objectivists  free market libertarians 75  and  in the United States  by strict constitutionalists largely because they object to the role of the government in issuing fiat currency through central banks  A significant number of gold standard advocates also call for a mandated end to fractional reserve banking  citation needed  Few politicians 76  today advocate a return to the gold standard  other than adherents of the Austrian school and some supply siders  However  some prominent economists have expressed sympathy with a hard currency basis  and have argued against politically controlled fiat money  including former U S  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan  himself a former Objectivist   and macro economist Robert Barro  77  Greenspan famously argued the case for returning to a  pure  gold standard in his 1966 paper  Gold and Economic Freedom   in which he described supporters of fiat currencies as  welfare statists  intent on using monetary policies to finance deficit spending  78  Barro argues in favor of adopting some form of  monetary constitution  that will provide stability to monetary policy rather than allowing decisions about monetary policy to be made on the basis of politics  but suggests that what form this constitution takes for example  a gold standard  some other commodity based standard  or a fiat currency with fixed rules for determining the quantity of money is considerably less important  77  U S  Congressman Ron Paul has continually argued for the reinstatement of the gold standard  but is no longer a strict advocate  instead supporting a basket of commodities that emerges on the free markets  79  For the time being  the global monetary system continues to rely on the U S  dollar as a reserve currency by which major transactions  such as the price of gold itself  are measured  80  A host of alternatives has been suggested  including energy based currencies  and market baskets of currencies or commodities  gold being one of the alternatives  In 2001  Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad proposed a new currency that would be used initially for international trade among Muslim nations  The currency he proposed was called the Islamic gold dinar and it was defined as 4 25 grams of pure  24 carat  gold  Mahathir Mohamad promoted the concept on the basis of its economic merits as a stable unit of account and also as a political symbol to create greater unity between Islamic nations  The purported purpose of this move would be to reduce dependence on the United States dollar as a reserve currency  and to establish a non debt backed currency in accord with Islamic law against the charging of interest  81  However  to date  Mahathir s proposed gold dinar currency has failed to take hold  In 2011  the legislature of the state of Utah passed a bill to accept federally issued gold and silver coins as legal tender to pay taxes  82  83  Similar legislation is under consideration in a number of other US states  Gold as a reserve today Main article  Gold reserve The Swiss Franc was based on a 40  legal gold reserve requirement from 1936  when
