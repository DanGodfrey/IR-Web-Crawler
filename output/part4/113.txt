 is a country in South America occupying a long  narrow strip of land between the Andes mountains to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west  It borders Peru to the north  Bolivia to the northeast  Argentina to the east  and the Drake Passage in the far south  Along with Ecuador  it is one of two countries in South America that does not border Brazil  Chile s coastline is the 5th largest in the world  at over 78 thousand kilometers  8  Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fern ndez  Salas y G mez  Desventuradas and Easter Island  Chile also claims about 1 250 000 square kilometres  480 000 sq mi  of Antarctica  although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty  The shape of Chile is a distinctive ribbon of land 4 300 kilometres  2 700 mi  long and on average 175 kilometres  109 mi  wide  Its climate varies  ranging from the world s driest desert   the Atacama   in the north  through a Mediterranean climate in the centre  to a rainy temperate climate in the south  9  The northern desert contains great mineral wealth  principally copper  The relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources  and is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century  when it incorporated its northern and southern regions  Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands and features a string of volcanoes and lakes  The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords  inlets  canals  twisting peninsulas  and islands  10  Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century  northern and central Chile was under Inca rule while the indigenous Mapuche inhabited southern Chile  Chile declared its independence from Spain on February 12  1818  In the War of the Pacific  1879 83   Chile defeated Peru and Bolivia and won its current northern territory  It was not until the 1880s that the Mapuche were completely subjugated  11  Although relatively free of the coups and arbitrary governments that blighted South America  Chile endured the 17 year long military dictatorship  1973 1990  of Augusto Pinochet that left more than 3 000 people dead or missing  9  Today  Chile is one of South America s most stable and prosperous nation 9  and a recognized middle power  12  It leads Latin American nations in human development  competitiveness  income per capita  globalization  economic freedom  low perception of corruption and state of peace  13  It also ranks high regionally in freedom of the press and democratic development  However  it has a high economic inequality  as measured by the Gini index  14  In May 2010 Chile became the first South American nation to join the OECD  15  Chile is a founding member of both the United Nations and the Union of

Healthcare 9 See also 10 References 11 Further reading 12 External links Etymology There are various theories about the origin of the word Chile  According to a theory by 17th century Spanish chronicler Diego de Rosales  16  the Incas of Peru called the valley of the Aconcagua  Chili  by corruption of the name of a Picunche tribal chief   cacique   called Tili  who ruled the area at the time of the Incan conquest in the 15th century  17  18  Another theory points to the similarity of the valley of the Aconcagua with that of the Casma Valley in Peru  where there was a town and valley named Chili  18  Other theories say Chile may derive its name from a Native American word meaning either  ends of the earth  or  sea gulls   19  from the Mapuche word chilli  which may mean  where the land ends   20  or from the Quechua chiri   cold   21  or tchili  meaning either  snow  21  22  or  the deepest point of the Earth   23  Another origin attributed to chilli is the onomatopoeic cheele cheele the Mapuche imitation of the warble of a bird locally known as trile  20  24  The Spanish conquistadors heard about this name from the Incas  and the few survivors of Diego de Almagro s first Spanish expedition south from Peru in 1535 36 called themselves the  men of Chilli   20  Ultimately  Almagro is credited with the universalization of the name Chile  after naming the Mapocho valley as such  18  History Main article  History of Chile Early history and colonization The Mapuche people were the original inhabitants of southern and central Chile About 10 000 years ago  migrating Native Americans settled in fertile valleys and coastal areas of what is present day Chile  Example settlement sites from the very early human habitation are Monte Verde  Cueva del Milodon and the Pali Aike Crater s lava tube  The Incas briefly extended their empire into what is now northern Chile  but the Mapuche  or Araucanians as they were known by the Spaniards  successfully resisted many attempts by the Inca Empire to subjugate them  despite their lack of state organization  25  They fought against the Sapa Inca Tupac Yupanqui and his army  The result of the bloody three day confrontation known as the Battle of the Maule was that the Inca conquest of the territories of Chile ended at the Maule river  26  In 1520  while attempting to circumnavigate the earth  Ferdinand Magellan discovered the southern passage now named after him  the Strait of Magellan  The next Europeans to reach Chile were Diego de Almagro and his band of Spanish conquistadors  who came from Peru in 1535 seeking gold  The Spanish encountered various cultures that supported themselves principally through slash and burn agriculture and hunting  The conquest of Chile began in earnest in 1540 and was carried out by Pedro de Valdivia  one of Francisco Pizarro s lieutenants  who founded the city of Santiago on February 12  1541  Although the Spanish did not find the extensive gold and silver they sought  they recognized the agricultural potential of Chile s central valley  and Chile became part of the Spanish Empire  26  Pedro de Valdivia Bernardo O Higgins  Supreme Director of Chile Conquest of the land took place gradually  and the Europeans suffered repeated setbacks at the hands of the local population  A massive Mapuche insurrection that began in 1553 resulted in Valdivia s death and the destruction of many of the colony s principal settlements  Subsequent major insurrections took place in 1598 and in 1655  Each time the Mapuche and other native groups revolted  the southern border of the colony was driven northward  The abolition of slavery by the Spanish crown in 1683 was done in recognition that enslaving the Mapuche intensified resistance rather than cowing them into submission  Despite the royal prohibitions relations remained strained from continual colonialist interference  27  Cut off to the north by desert  to the south by the Mapuche  to the east by the Andes Mountains  and to the west by the ocean  Chile became one of the most centralized  homogeneous colonies in Spanish America  Serving as a sort of frontier garrison  the colony found itself with the mission of forestalling encroachment by both the Mapuche and Spain s European enemies  especially the British and the Dutch  Buccaneers and English adventurers menaced the colony in addition to the Mapuche  as was shown by Sir Francis Drake s 1578 raid on Valpara so  the colony s principal port  Chile hosted one of the largest standing armies in the Americas  making it one of the most militarized of the Spanish possessions  as well as a drain on the treasury of the Viceroyalty of Peru  20  The first general census was performed by the government of Agust n de J uregui between 1777 and 1778  it indicated that the population consisted of 259 646 inhabitants  73 5  of European descent  7 9  mestizos  8 6  Indians and 9 8  blacks  Francisco Hurtado  Governor of the province of Chilo   conducted a census there in 1784 and found the population consisted of 26 703 inhabitants  64 4  of which were whites and 33 5  of which were natives  The Diocese of Concepci n conducted a census of areas south of the Maule river in 1812  but did not include the indigenous population or the inhabitants of the province of Chilo   The population is estimated at 210 567  86 1  of which were Spanish or of European descent  10  of which were Indians and 3 7  of which were mestizos  blacks and mulattos  28  Independence The usurpation of the Spanish throne by Napoleon s brother Joseph in 1808 precipitated the drive by the colony for independence from Spain  A national junta in the name of Ferdinand   heir to the deposed king   was formed on September 18  1810  The Government Junta of Chile proclaimed Chile an autonomous republic within the Spanish monarchy  in memory of this day Chile celebrates its National Day on September 18 each year   After these events  a movement for total independence  under the command of Jos  Miguel Carrera  one of the most renowned patriots  and his two brothers Juan Jos  and Luis Carrera  soon gained a wider following  Spanish attempts to re impose arbitrary rule during what was called the Reconquista led to a prolonged struggle  including infighting from Bernardo O Higgins  who challenged Carrera s leadership  Intermittent warfare continued until 1817  With Carrera in prison in Argentina  O Higgins and anti Carrera cohort Jos  de San Mart n  hero of the Argentine War of Independence  led an army that crossed the Andes into Chile and defeated the royalists  On February 12  1818  Chile was proclaimed an independent republic  The political revolt brought little social change  however  and 19th century Chilean society preserved the essence of the stratified colonial social structure  which was greatly influenced by family politics and the Roman Catholic Church  A strong presidency eventually emerged  but wealthy landowners remained powerful  26  War of the Pacific  The Battle of Iquique on May 21  1879 Toward the end of the 19th century  the government in Santiago consolidated its position in the south by suppressing the Mapuche during the Occupation of Araucan a  A treaty with Argentina confirming Chilean sovereignty over the Strait of Magellan was signed in 1881  As a result of the War of the Pacific with Peru and Bolivia  1879 83   Chile expanded its territory northward by almost one third  eliminating Bolivia s access to the Pacific  and acquired valuable nitrate deposits  the exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence  The Chilean Civil War in 1891 brought about a redistribution of power between the President and Congress  and Chile established a parliamentary style democracy  However  the Civil War had also been a contest between those who favored the development of local industries and powerful Chilean banking interests  particularly the House of Edwards who had strong ties to foreign investors  20th century The Chilean economy partially degenerated into a system protecting the interests of a ruling oligarchy  By the 1920s  the emerging middle and working classes were powerful enough to elect a reformist president  Arturo Alessandri  whose program was frustrated by a conservative congress  In the 1920s  Marxist groups with strong popular support arose  26  A military coup led by General Luis Altamirano in 1924 set off a period of political instability that lasted until 1932  Of the ten governments that held power in that period  the longest lasting was that of General Carlos Ib  ez del Campo  who briefly held power in 1925 and then again between 1927 and 1931 in what was a de facto dictatorship  although not really comparable in harshness or corruption to the type of military dictatorship that has often bedeviled the rest of Latin America   29  30  By relinquishing power to a democratically elected successor  Ib  ez del Campo retained the respect of a large enough segment of the population to remain a viable politician for more than thirty years  in spite of the vague and shifting nature of his ideology  When constitutional rule was restored in 1932  a strong middle class party  the Radicals  emerged  It became the key force in coalition governments for the next 20 years  During the period of Radical Party dominance  1932 52   the state increased its role in the economy  In 1952  voters returned Ib  ez del Campo to office for another six years  Jorge Alessandri succeeded Ib  ez del Campo in 1958  bringing Chilean conservatism back into power democratically for another term  The 1964 presidential election of Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei Montalva by an absolute majority initiated a period of major reform  Under the slogan  Revolution in Liberty   the Frei administration embarked on far reaching social and economic programs  particularly in education  housing  and agrarian reform  including rural unionization of agricultural workers  By 1967  however  Frei encountered increasing opposition from leftists  who charged that his reforms were inadequate  and from conservatives  who found them excessive  At the end of his term  Frei had not fully achieved his party s ambitious goals  26  President Salvador Allende In the 1970 election  Senator Salvador Allende of the Socialist Party of Chile  part of the  Popular Unity  coalition which included the Communists  Radicals  Social Democrats  dissident Christian Democrats  the Popular Unitary Action Movement  and the Independent Popular Action   26  achieved a partial majority in a plurality of votes in a three way contest  followed by candidates Radomiro Tomic for the Christian Democrat Party and Jorge Alessandri for the Conservative Party  Allende was not elected with an absolute majority  receiving fewer than 35  of votes  It became a war of classes  motivated by the central government  Despite pressure from the United States government  the Chilean Congress conducted a runoff vote between the leading candidates  Allende and former president Jorge Alessandri and keeping with tradition  chose Allende by a vote of 153 to 35  Frei refused to form an alliance with Alessandri to oppose Allende  on the grounds that the Christian Democrats were a workers party and could not make common cause with the right wing  31  32  An economic depression that began in 1972 was exacerbated by capital flight  plummeting private investment  and withdrawal of bank deposits in response to Allende s socialist program  Production fell and unemployment rose  Allende adopted measures including price freezes  wage increases  and tax reforms  to increase consumer spending and redistribute income downward  33  Joint public private public works projects helped reduce unemployment  34  page needed  Much of the banking sector was nationalized  Many enterprises within the copper  coal  iron  nitrate  and steel industries were expropriated  nationalized  or subjected to state intervention  Industrial output increased sharply and unemployment fell during the Allende administration s first year  34  Augusto Pinochet Allende s program included advancement of workers  interests  34  35  replacing the judicial system with  socialist legality   36  nationalization of banks and forcing others to bankruptcy  37  and strengthening  popular militias  known as MIR  37  Started under former President Frei  the Popular Unity platform also called for nationalization of Chile s major copper mines in the form of a constitutional amendment  The measure was passed unanimously by Congress  As a result  38  the Richard Nixon administration organized and inserted secret operatives in Chile  in order to quickly destabilize Allende s government  39  In addition  American financial pressure restricted international economic credit to Chile  40  The economic problems were also exacerbated by Allende s public spending which was financed mostly by printing money and poor credit ratings given by commercial banks  41  Simultaneously  opposition media  politicians  business guilds and other organizations helped to accelerate a campaign of domestic political and economical destabilization  some of which was helped by the United States  40  42  By early 1973  inflation was out of control  The crippled economy was further battered by prolonged and sometimes simultaneous strikes by physicians  teachers  students  truck owners  copper workers  and the small business class  On 26 May 1973  Chile s Supreme Court  which was opposed to Allende s government  unanimously denounced the Allende disruption of the legality of the nation  Although illegal under the Chilean constitution  the court supported and strengthened Pinochet s seizure of power  37  43  Finally  a military coup overthrew Allende on September 11  1973  As the armed forces bombarded the presidential palace  Allende apparently committed suicide  44  45  A military junta  led by General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte  took over control of the country  The first years of the regime were marked by human rights violations  On October 1973  at least 72 people were murdered by the Caravan of Death  46  According to the Rettig Report and Valech Commission  at least 2 115 were killed  47  and at least 27 265  48  were tortured  including 88 children younger than 12 years old   48  A new Constitution was approved by a controversial plebiscite on September 11  1980  and General Pinochet became president of the republic for an 8 year term  After Pinochet obtained rule of the country  several hundred committed Chilean revolutionaries joined the Sandinista army in Nicaragua  guerrilla forces in Argentina or training camps in Cuba  Eastern Europe and Northern Africa  49  In the late 1980s  largely as a result of events such as the 1982 economic collapse 50  and mass civil resistance in 1983 88  the government gradually permitted greater freedom of assembly  speech  and association  to include trade union and political activity  51  The government launched market oriented reforms with Hern n B chi as Minister of Finance  but poverty levels continued growing  52  Chile moved toward a free market economy that saw an increase in domestic and foreign private investment  although the copper industry and other important mineral resources were not opened for competition  In a plebiscite on October 5  1988  General Pinochet was denied a second 8 year term as president  56  against 44    Chileans elected a new president and the majority of members of a two chamber congress on December 14  1989  Christian Democrat Patricio Aylwin  the candidate of a coalition of 17 political parties called the Concertaci n  received an absolute majority of votes  55    53  President Aylwin served from 1990 to 1994  in what was considered a transition period  In December 1993  Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei Ruiz Tagle  the son of previous president Eduardo Frei Montalva  led the Concertaci n coalition to victory with an absolute majority of votes  58    54  21st century See also  2010 Chile earthquake and 2010 Copiap  mining accident All five Chilean presidents since 1990  Frei Ruiz Tagle was succeeded in 2000 by Socialist Ricardo Lagos  who won the presidency in an unprecedented runoff election against Joaqu n Lav n of the rightist Alliance for Chile  55  In January 2006  Chileans elected their first female president  Michelle Bachelet Jeria  of the Socialist Party  defeating Sebasti n Pi era  of the National Renewal party  extending the Concertaci n governance for another four years  56  57  In January 2010  Chileans elected Sebasti n Pi era  of the National Renewal party  as the first rightist President in 20 years  defeating former President Eduardo Frei Ruiz Tagle of the Concertaci n  for a four year term succeeding Bachelet  On February 27  2010  Chile was struck by an 8 8 MWearthquake  the fifth largest ever recorded at the time  More than 500 people died  most from the ensuing tsunami  and over a million people lost their homes  The earthquake was also followed by multiple aftershocks  58  Initial damage estimates were in the range of US 15 30 billion  around 10  to 15  of Chile real gross domestic product  59  Chile achieved global recognition for the successful rescue of 33 trapped miners in 2010  On August 5  2010 the access tunnel collapsed at the San Jose copper and gold mine in the Atacama Desert near Copiap  in northern Chile  trapping 33 men 700 meters  2 300 ft   below ground  A rescue effort organized by the Chilean Government located the miners 17 days later  All 33 men were brought to the surface on October 13  2010  over a period of almost 24 hours  an effort that was carried on live television around the world  60  Politics Main articles  Politics of Chile and Law of Chile The Palacio de La Moneda in downtown Santiago  The Palace of Justice in Santiago  The current Constitution of Chile was approved in a national plebiscite  regarded as  highly irregular  by some observers 61   in September 1980  under the military government of Augusto Pinochet  It entered into force in March 1981  After Pinochet s defeat in the 1988 plebiscite  the constitution was amended to ease provisions for future amendments to the Constitution  In September 2005  President Ricardo Lagos signed into law several constitutional amendments passed by Congress  These include eliminating the positions of appointed senators and senators for life  granting the President authority to remove the commanders in chief of the armed forces  and reducing the presidential term from six to four years  62  Chileans voted in the first round of presidential elections on December 13  2009  None of the four presidential candidates got more than 50  of the vote  As a result  the top two candidates  center left Concertaci n de Partidos por la Democracia coalition s Eduardo Frei Ruiz Tagle and center right Coalici n por el Cambio coalition s Sebasti n Pi era  competed in a run off election on January 17  2010  which Sebasti n Pi era won  This was Chile s fifth presidential election since the end of the Pinochet era  All five have been judged free and fair  The president is constitutionally barred from serving consecutive terms  The Congress of Chile has a 38 seat Senate and a 120 member Chamber of Deputies  Senators serve for 8 years with staggered terms  while deputies are elected every 4 years  The current Senate has a 20 18 split in favor of the opposition coalition  The last congressional elections were held on December 13  2009  concurrently with the presidential election  The current lower house the Chamber of Deputies contains 58 members of the governing center right coalition  54 from the center left opposition and 8 from small parties or independents  The Congress is located in the port city of Valpara so  about 140 kilometres  84 mi  west of the capital  Santiago  Chile s congressional elections are governed by a binominal systemsystem that  for the most part  rewards the two largest representations equally  often regardless of their relative popular support  Parties are thus forced to form wide coalitions and  historically  the two largest coalitions  Concertaci n and Alianza  split most of the seats  Only if the leading coalition ticket out polls the second place coalition by a margin of more than 2 to 1 does the winning coalition gain both seats  which tends to lock the legislative in a roughly 50 50 split  In the 2001 congressional elections  the conservative Independent Democratic Union surpassed the Christian Democrats for the first time to become the largest party in the lower house  In the 2005 parliamentary election  both leading parties  the Christian Democrats and the UDI lost representation in favor of their respective allies Socialist Party  which became the biggest party in the Concertaci n block  and National Renewal in the right wing alliance  In the last legislative elections in Chile  the Communist Party won 3 out of 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies for the first time in 30 years  the Communisty Party was not allowed to exist as such during the dictatorship   Chile s judiciary is independent and includes a court of appeal  a

port of Callao for preeminence in the Pacific trade routes  defeating the short lived alliance between Peru and Bolivia  the Peru Bolivian Confederation  1836 39  in the War of the Confederation  The war dissolved the confederation while distributing power in the Pacific  A second international war  the War of the Pacific  1879 83   further increased Chile s regional role  while adding considerably to its territory  20  During the 19th century  Chile s commercial ties were primarily with Britain  a country that had a decisive influence on the organization of the navy  The French influenced Chile s legal and educational systems and had a decisive impact on Chile  through the architecture of the capital in the boom years at the turn of the 20th century  German influence came from the organization and training of the army by Prussians  20  On June 26  1945  Chile participated as a founding member of the United Nations being among 50 countries that signed the United Nations Charter in San Francisco  California  68  69  70  With the military coup of 1973  Chile became isolated politically as a result of widespread human rights abuses  20  Since its return to democracy in

in northern Chile A long and narrow coastal Southern Cone country on the west side of the Andes Mountains  Chile stretches over 4 630 kilometres  2 880 mi  north to south  but only 430 kilometres  265 mi  at its widest point east to west  This encompasses a remarkable variety of landscapes  It contains 756 950 square kilometres  292 260 sq mi  of land area  It is situated within the Pacific Ring of Fire  Including its offshore islands  but excluding its Antarctic claim  Chile lies between latitudes 17  and 56 S  and longitudes 66  and 81 W  The northern Atacama Desert contains great mineral wealth  primarily copper and nitrates  The relatively small Central Valley  which includes Santiago  dominates the country in terms of population and agricultural resources  This area also is the historical center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century  when it integrated the northern and southern regions  Southern Chile is rich in forests  grazing lands  and features a string of volcanoes and lakes  The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords  inlets  canals  twisting peninsulas  and islands  The Andes Mountains are located on the eastern border  Chile is the longest north south country in the world  and also claims 1 250 000 km2  480 000 sq mi  of Antarctica as part of its territory  However  this latter claim is suspended under the terms of the Antarctic Treaty  of which Chile is a signatory  72  Chile controls Easter Island and Sala y G mez Island  the easternmost islands of Polynesia  which it incorporated to its territory in 1888  and Robinson Crusoe Island  more than 600 kilometres  370 mi  from the mainland  in the Juan Fern ndez Islands  Easter Island is today a province of Chile  Also controlled but only temporarily inhabited  by some local fishermen  are the small islands of Sala y G mez  San Ambrosio and San Felix  These islands are notable because they extend Chile s claim to territorial waters out from its coast into the Pacific  73  Climate Main article  Climate of Chile The climate of Chile comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a large geographic scale  extending across 38 degrees in latitude  making generalisations difficult  According to the K ppen system  Chile within its borders hosts at least seven major climatic subtypes  ranging from desert in the north  to alpine tundra and glaciers in the east and south east  humid subtropical in Easter Island  Oceanic in the south and Mediterranean climate in central Chile  There are four seasons in most of the country  summer  December to February   autumn  March to May   winter  June to August   and spring  September to November   Biodiversity Main article  Wildlife of Chile A glacier at Beagle Channel in southern Chile Juan Fern ndez Firecrown Fauna Chile s geographical isolation also has restricted the immigration of faunal life  so that only a few of the many distinctive South American animals are found  Among the larger mammals are the puma or cougar  the llama like guanaco and the fox like chilla  In the forest region  several types of marsupials and a small deer known as the pudu are found  74  There are many species of small birds  but most of the larger common Latin American types are absent  Few freshwater fish are native  but North American trout have been successfully introduced into the Andean lakes  74  Owing to the vicinity of the Humboldt Current  ocean waters abound with fish and other forms of marine life  which in turn support a rich variety of waterfowl  including several penguins  Whales are abundant  and some six species of seals are found in the area  74  Fungi Just over 3 000 species of fungi are recorded in Chile  75  76  but this number is far from complete  The true total number of fungal species occurring in Chile is likely to be far higher  given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7  of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered  77  Although the amount of available information is still very small  a first effort has been made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to Chile  and 1995 species have been tentatively identified as possible endemics of the country  78  Flora The northernmost coastal and central region is largely barren of vegetation  approaching the most closely an absolute desert in the world  74  On the slopes of the Andes  besides the scattered tola desert brush  grasses are found  The central valley is characterized by several species of cacti  the hardy espinos  the Chilean pine  the southern beeches and the copihue  a red bell shaped flower that is Chile s national flower  74  In southern Chile  south of the Biob o River  heavy precipitation has produced dense forests of laurels  magnolias  and various species of conifers and beeches  which become smaller and more stunted to the south   79  The cold temperatures and winds of the extreme south preclude heavy forestation  Grassland is found in Atlantic Chile  in Patagonia   Much of the Chilean flora is distinct from that of neighboring Argentina  indicating that the Andean barrier existed during its formation  79  Economy Main article  Economy of Chile Santiago s financial district  Pictured  Titanium La Portada  left  and Torre Gran Costanera  right   May 2011   Chile is one of South America s most stable and prosperous nations  9  leading Latin American nations in human development  competitiveness  income per capita  globalization  economic freedom  and low perception of corruption  13  However  it has a high economic inequality  as measured by the Gini index  14  In May 2010 Chile became the first South American country to join the OECD  15  In 2006  Chile became the country with the highest nominal GDP per capita in Latin America  80  During the early 1990s  Chile s reputation as a role model for economic reform was strengthened when the democratic government of Patricio Aylwin  who took over from the military in 1990  deepened the economic reform initiated by the military government  Growth in real GDP averaged 8  from 1991 1997  citation needed  but fell to half that level in 1998 because of tight monetary policies  implemented to keep the current account deficit in check  and because of lower export earnings  the latter which was a product of the Asian financial crisis  Chile s economy has since recovered and has seen growth rates of 5 7  over the past several years  citation needed  After a decade of impressive growth rates  Chile began to experience a moderate economic downturn in 1999  brought on by unfavorable global economic conditions related to the Asian financial crisis  which began in 1997  The economy remained sluggish until 2003  when it began to show clear signs of recovery  achieving 4 0  real GDP growth  81  The Chilean economy finished 2004 with growth of 6   Real GDP growth reached 5 7  in 2005 before falling back to 4  in 2006  GDP expanded by 5  in 2007  26  Unemployment hovered at 8  10  after the start of the economic slowdown in 1999  above the 7  average for the 1990s  Unemployment finally dipped to 7 8  in 2006  and continued to fall in 2007  averaging 6 8  monthly  up to August   82  Wages have risen faster than inflation as a result of higher productivity  boosting national living standards  The percentage of Chileans with per capita household incomes below the poverty line defined as twice the cost of satisfying a person s minimal nutritional needs fell from 45 1  in 1987 to 11 5  in 2009  according to government surveys  83  84  Critics in Chile  however  argue that true poverty figures are considerably higher than those officially published   The government constructs the poverty line based on an outdated 1987 household consumption survey  instead of more recent surveys from 1997 or 2007   According to these critics  using data from the 1997 survey increases the poverty rate to 29   85  Using the relative yardstick favoured in many European countries  27  of Chileans would be poor  according to Juan Carlos Feres of the ECLAC  86  High domestic savings and investment rates helped propel Chile s economy to average growth rates of 8  during the 1990s  The privatized national pension system  AFP  has encouraged domestic investment and contributed to an estimated total domestic savings rate of approximately 21  of GDP  87  Total foreign direct investment  FDI  was only  3 4 billion in 2006  up 52  from a poor performance in 2005  However  80  of FDI continues to go to only four sectors  electricity  gas  water and mining  Much of the jump in FDI in 2006 was also the result of acquisitions and mergers  but has done little to create new employment in Chile  citation needed  Economic policies Chilean  blue  and average Latin American  orange  GDP per capita  1950 2007   Sound economic policies  maintained consistently since the 1980s  have contributed to steady economic growth in Chile and have more than halved poverty rates  11  26  The 1973 90 military government sold many state owned companies  and the three democratic governments since 1990 have continued privatization  though at a slower pace  The government s role in the economy is mostly limited to regulation  although the state continues to operate copper giant CODELCO and a few other enterprises  there is one state run bank   Chile is strongly committed to free trade and has welcomed large amounts of foreign investment  Chile has signed free trade agreements  FTAs  with a whole network of countries  including an FTA with the United States that was signed in 2003 and implemented in January 2004  88  Chile s independent Central Bank pursues an inflation target of between 2  and 4   Inflation has not exceeded 5  since 1998  Chile registered an inflation rate of 3 2  in 2006  The Chilean peso s rapid appreciation against the U S  dollar in recent years has helped dampen inflation  Most wage settlements and loans are indexed  reducing inflation s volatility  Under the compulsory private pension system  most formal sector employees pay 10  of their salaries into privately managed funds  26  As of 2006  Chile invested only 0 6  of its annual GDP in research and development  R amp D   Even then  two thirds of that was government spending  Beyond its general economic and political stability  the government has also encouraged the use of Chile as an  investment platform  for multinational corporations planning to operate in the region  but this will have limited value given the developing business climate in Chile itself  specify  Chile s approach to foreign direct investment is codified in the country s Foreign Investment Law  which gives foreign investors the same treatment as Chileans  Registration is reported to be simple and transparent  and foreign investors are guaranteed access to the official foreign exchange market to repatriate their profits and capital  26  Faced with an international economic downturn the government announced a  4 billion economic stimulus plan to spur employment and growth  and despite the global financial crisis  aimed for an expansion of between 2 percent and 3 percent of GDP for 2009  Nonetheless  economic analysts disagreed with government estimates and predicted economic growth at a median of 1 5 percent  89  According to the CIA World FactBook  the GDP contracted an estimated  1 7  in 2009  citation needed  The Chilean Government has formed a Council on Innovation and Competition  which is tasked with identifying new sectors and industries to promote  It is hoped that this  combined with some tax reforms to encourage domestic and foreign investment in research and development  will bring in additional FDI to new parts of the economy  26  Chile maintains one of the best credit ratings  S amp P A   in Latin America  90  There are three main ways for Chilean firms to raise funds abroad  bank loans  issuance of bonds  and the selling of stocks on U S  markets through American Depository Receipts  ADRs   Nearly all of the funds raised through these means go to finance domestic Chilean investment  The government is required by law to run a fiscal surplus of at least 1  of GDP  In 2006  the Government of Chile ran a surplus of  11 3 billion  equal to almost 8  of GDP  The Government of Chile continues to pay down its foreign debt  with public debt only 3 9  of GDP at the end of 2006  26  Foreign trade Chile produces more than a third of the world s copper 2006 was a record year for Chilean trade  Total trade registered a 31  increase over 2005  During 2006  exports of goods and services totaled US  58 billion  an increase of 41   This figure was somewhat distorted by the skyrocketing price of copper  In 2006  copper exports reached a historical high of US  33 3 billion  Imports totaled US  35 billion  an increase of 17  compared to the previous year  Chile thus recorded a positive trade balance of US  23 billion in 2006  26  The main destinations for Chilean exports were the Americas  US  39 billion   Asia  US  27 8 billion  and Europe  US  22 2 billion   Seen as shares of Chile s export markets  42  of exports went to the Americas  30  to Asia and 24  to Europe  Within Chile s diversified network of trade relationships  its most important partner remained the United States  Total trade with the U S  was US  14 8 billion in 2006  Since the U S  Chile Free Trade Agreement went into effect on January 1  2004  U S  Chilean trade has increased by 154   Internal Government of Chile figures show that even when factoring out inflation and the recent high price of copper  bilateral trade between the U S  and Chile has grown over 60  since then  26  Total trade with Europe also grew in 2006  expanding by 42   The Netherlands and Italy were Chile s main European trading partners  Total trade with Asia also grew significantly at nearly 31   Trade with Korea and Japan grew significantly  but China remained Chile s most important trading partner in Asia  Chile s total trade with China reached U S   8 8 billion in 2006  representing nearly 66  of the value of its trade relationship with Asia  26  Chile is the world s fifth largest exporter of wine and the eighth largest producer 91  The growth of exports in 2006 was mainly caused by a strong increase in sales to the United States  the Netherlands  and Japan  These three markets alone accounted for an additional US  5 5 billion worth of Chilean exports  Chilean exports to the United States totaled US  9 3 billion  representing a 37 7  increase compared to 2005  US  6 7 billion   Exports to the European Union were US  15 4 billion  a 63 7  increased compared to 2005  US  9 4 billion   Exports to Asia increased from US  15 2 billion in 2005 to US  19 7 billion in 2006  a 29 9  increase  26  During 2006  Chile imported US  26 billion from the Americas  representing 54  of total imports  followed by Asia at 22   and Europe at 16   Mercosur members were the main suppliers of imports to Chile at US  9 1 billion  followed by the United States with US  5 5 billion and the European Union with US  5 2 billion  From Asia  China was the most important exporter to Chile  with goods valued at US  3 6 billion  Year on year growth in imports was especially strong from a number of countries Ecuador  123 9    Thailand  72 1    Korea  52 6    and China  36 9    26  Chile s overall trade profile has traditionally been dependent upon copper exports  The state owned firm CODELCO is the world s largest copper producing company  with recorded copper reserves of 200 years  Chile has made an effort to expand nontraditional exports  The most important non mineral exports are forestry and wood products  fresh fruit and processed food  fishmeal and seafood  and wine  26  Trade agreements Over the last several years  Chile has signed free trade agreements  FTA s  with the European Union  South Korea  New Zealand  Singapore  Brunei  China  and Japan  It reached a partial trade agreement with India in 2005 and began negotiations for a full fledged FTA with India in 2006  Chile conducted trade negotiations in 2007 with Australia  Malaysia  and Thailand  as well as with China to expand an existing agreement beyond just trade in goods  Chile concluded FTA negotiations with Australia and an expanded agreement with China in 2008  The members of the P4  Chile  Singapore  New Zealand  and Brunei  also plan to conclude a chapter on finance and investment in 2008  26  Successive Chilean governments have actively pursued trade liberalizing agreements  During the 1990s  Chile signed free trade agreements FTA with Canada  Mexico  and Central America  Chile also concluded preferential trade agreements with Venezuela  Colombia  and Ecuador  An association agreement with Mercosur Argentina  Brazil  Paraguay  and Uruguay went into effect in October 1996  Continuing its export oriented development strategy  Chile completed landmark free trade agreements in 2002 with the European Union and South Korea  Chile  as a member of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation  APEC  organization  is seeking to boost commercial ties to Asian markets  To that end  it has signed trade agreements in recent years with New Zealand  Singapore  Brunei  India  China  and most recently Japan  In 2007  Chile held trade negotiations with Australia  Thailand  Malaysia  and China  In 2008  Chile hopes to conclude an FTA with Australia  and finalize an expanded agreement  covering trade in services and investment  with China  The P4  Chile  Singapore  New Zealand  and Brunei  also plan to expand ties through adding a finance and investment chapter to the existing P4 agreement  Chile s trade talks with Malaysia and Thailand are also scheduled to continue in 2008  26  The port of San Antonio After two years of negotiations  the United States and Chile signed an agreement in June 2003 that will lead to completely duty free bilateral trade within 12 years  The U S  Chile FTA entered into force January 1  2004  following approval by the U S  and Chilean congresses  The bilateral FTA has inaugurated greatly expanded U S  Chilean trade ties  with total bilateral trade jumping by 154  during the FTA s first three years  26  Chile unilaterally lowered its across the board import tariff for all countries with which it does not have a trade agreement to 6  in 2003  Higher effective tariffs are charged only on imports of wheat  wheat flour  and sugar as a result of a system of import price bands  The price bands were ruled inconsistent with Chile s World Trade Organization  WTO  obligations in 2002  and the government has introduced legislation to modify them  Under the terms of the U S  Chile FTA  the price bands will be completely phased out for U S  imports of wheat  wheat flour  and sugar within 12 years  26  Chile is a strong proponent of pressing ahead on negotiations for a Free Trade Area of the Americas  FTAA  and is active in the WTO s Doha round of negotiations  principally through its membership in the G 20 and Cairns Group  26  Finance Skyline of Santiago s Financial District  aka Sanhattan  Chile s financial sector has grown quickly in recent years  with a banking reform law approved in 1997 that broadened the scope of permissible foreign activity for Chilean banks  The Chilean Government implemented a further liberalization of capital markets in 2001  and there is further pending legislation proposing further liberalization  Over the last ten years  Chileans have enjoyed the introduction of new financial tools such as home equity loans  currency futures and options  factoring  leasing  and debit cards  The introduction of these new products has also been accompanied by an increased use of traditional instruments such as loans and credit cards  Chile s private pension system  with assets worth roughly  70 billion at the end of 2006  has been an important source of investment capital for the capital market  However  by 2009  it has been reported that  21 billion had been lost from the pension system to the global financial crisis  92  The countries largest companies are airline LAN and retailers Cencosud and S A C I  Falabella  Tourism Main article  Tourism in Chile Easter Island Tourism in Chile has experienced sustained growth over the last few decades  In 2005  tourism grew by 13 6   generating more than 4 5 billion dollars of which 1 5 billion is attributed to foreign tourists  According to the National Service of Tourism  Sernatur   2 million people a year visit the country  Most of these visitors come from other countries in the American continent  mainly Argentina  followed by a growing number from the United States  Europe  and Brazil with a growing number of Asians from South Korea and PR China  93  The main attractions for tourists are places of natural beauty situated in the extreme zones of the country  San Pedro de Atacama  in the north  is very popular with foreign tourists who arrive to admire the Incaic architecture  the altiplano lakes  and the Valley of the Moon  In Putre  also in the North  there is the Chungar  Lake  as well as the Parinacota and the Pomerape volcanoes  with altitudes of 6 348 m and 6 282 m  respectively  Throughout the central Andes there are many ski resorts of international repute  including Portillo  Valle Nevado and Termas de Chill n  The main tourist sites in the south are the coastal area around Tir a and Ca ete with the Isla Mocha and the Nahuelbuta National Park  Chilo  Archipelago and Patagonia  which includes Laguna San Rafael National Park  with its many glaciers  and the Torres del Paine National Park  The central port city of Valpara so  which is World Heritage with its unique architecture  is also popular  Finally  Easter Island in the Pacific Ocean is one of the main Chilean tourist destinations  For locals  tourism is concentrated mostly in the summer  December to March   and mainly in the coastal beach towns  Arica  Iquique  Antofagasta  La Serena and Coquimbo are the main summer centres in the north  and Puc n on the shores of Lake Villarrica is the main centre in the south  Because of its proximity to Santiago  the coast of the Valpara so Region  with its many beach resorts  receives the largest number of tourists  Vi a del Mar  Valpara so s northern affluent neighbor  is popular because of its beaches  casino  and its annual song festival  the most important musical event in Latin America  Pichilemu in the O Higgins Region is widely known as South America s  best surfing spot   according to

Demographics Main article  Demographics of Chile Population of Chile from 1820  projected up to 2050 Chile s 2002 census reported a population of 15 1 million people  Its rate of population growth has been decreasing since 1990  due of a declining birth rate  95  By 2050 the population is expected to reach approximately 20 2 million people  96  About 85  of the country s population lives in urban areas  with 40  living in Greater Santiago  The largest agglomerations according to the 2002 census are Greater Santiago with 5 6 million people  Greater Concepci n with 861 000 and Greater Valpara so with 824 000  97  Chile is a multiethnic society  and a majority of the population can claim some European ancestry  mainly Spanish  Castilian  Andalusian  and Basque   but also German  Italian  Irish  French  British  Swiss  and Croatian  in various combinations  A small yet influential number of Irish and English immigrants came to Chile during the colonial period  German immigration began in the mid 1800s and continued into the 20th century  the southern provinces of Valdivia  Llanquihue  and Osorno show a strong German influence  In addition  there are a significant number of Middle Eastern  mainly Palestinian  immigrants and their descendants  About 800 000 Native Americans  mostly Mapuche  reside in the south central area  The Aymara  Atacameno  and Diaguita groups can be found mainly in Chile s northern desert valleys and oases  Easter Island  Rapa Nui  is home to the Rapa Nui  an indigenous population  60  Indigenous communities Main article  Indigenous peoples in Chile Mapuches

irrespective of their  racial purity   98  According to the 2002 census  only indigenous people that still practiced a native culture or spoke a native language were surveyed  and 4 6  of the population  692 192 people  fit that description  Of that 4 6   87 3  declared themselves Mapuche  99  Most of the indigenous population show varying degrees of mixed ancestry  100  Chile is one of 22 countries to have signed and ratified the only binding international law concerning indigenous peoples  Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention  1989  101  It was adopted in 1989 as the International Labour Organization  ILO  Convention 169  Chile ratified it in 2008  A Chilean court decision in November 2009  considered to be a landmark ruling in indigenous rights concerns  made use of the convention  The Supreme Court decision on Aymara water rights upheld rulings by both the Pozo Almonte tribunal and the Iquique Court of Appeals  and marks the first judicial application of ILO Convention 169 in Chile  102  Immigration Main article  Immigration to Chile A German influenced Puerto Varas Church An important number of non Spanish immigrants have arrived in Chile from various countries and regions  including Italy  Ireland  France  Greece  Germany  England  the Netherlands  Scotland  Croatia  and the Middle East  The largest contingent of people to arrive in Chile came from Spain  mainly the Basque country  beginning in the 16th century  Estimates of the number of people in Chile who can trace descent from Basques range from 10   1 600 000  to as high as 27   4 500 000   103  104  105  106  107  108  109  110  Louis Thayer Ojeda estimates that during the 17th and 18th centuries fully 45  of all immigrants in Chile were Basques  111  In 1848 an important and substantial German immigration took place  laying the foundation for the German Chilean community  112  113  Sponsored by the Chilean government for the colonization of the southern region  the Germans  including German speaking Swiss  Silesians  Alsatians and Austrians   strongly influenced the ethnic composition of the southern provinces of Chile  German immigrants have made a cultural impact in many areas of southern Chile  which is a sparsely populated region  The Consulate of Chile in Germany estimates that 500 000 to 600 000 Chileans  or between 3  to 3 5  of the population today  are descended from German immigrants 114  Most of them were located in the Los R os Region  It is estimated that nearly five percent of the Chilean population  or about 800 000 people  are of Middle Eastern origin  these include  most notably  Palestinians  Syrians  Lebanese and Middle Eastern Armenians   115  116  Note that Israelis  both Jewish and non Jewish citizens of the nation of Israel  may be included  Chile is home to a large population of immigrants  mostly Christian  from the Levant  115  Roughly 500 000 of Chile s population is of full or partial Palestinian origin  117  118  119  120  121  Italian immigrants to Capitan Pastene in southern Chile  Other historically significant immigrant groups in Chile include Croatians  whose descendants today have been estimated to number some 380 000 people  or about 2 4  of the population   122  123  Other authorities estimate that close to 4 6  of the Chilean population may have some Croatian ancestry  124  Over 700 000 Chileans  or about 4 5  of the national population  may have some English  Scottish  or Welsh ancestry  125  Chileans of Greek descent are estimated to number between 90 000 and 120 000 people  126  placing Chile among the five countries in the world with the most Greek descendants  127  Most live in or near either Santiago or Antofagasta  Swiss descendants add another 90 000 people to the population  128  Perhaps five percent of the Chilean population has some French ancestry  129  Between 600 000 and 800 000 Chileans are descended from Italian immigrants  Other groups of Europeans have followed but are found in smaller numbers  as the descendants of Austrians 130  and Dutchmen it is currently estimated at about 50 000 people  131  132  Altogether  these immigrants with their descendants  they have transformed the country culturally  economically and politically  European emigration to Chile  and to a lesser extent  the arrivals from the Middle East   during the second half of the 19th century and throughout the twentieth  was mostly to Latin America and then to areas like the Atlantic Coast of the Southern Cone  133  134  135  Descendants of different European ethnic groups often intermarried in Chile  diluting the cultures and separate identities of the home countries and fusing them together with the descendants of the original Basque Castilian aristocracy of the colonial period  while at the same time preserving some separate aspects  This intermarriage and mixture of cultures and races has help shape the present society and culture of the Chilean middle and upper classes  104  who now enjoy varied elements of their original European cultures  such as British afternoon tea  German cakes  and Italian pasta  The fusion is also visible in the architecture of Chilean cities  These classes do  however  frequently deprecate Chilean folk culture  an offshoot of the culture of the Spaniards who settled the country in the colonial period

South American countries because final syllables and  s  sounds are dropped  and some consonants have a soft pronunciation  Accent varies only very slightly from north to south  more noticeable are the small differences in accent based on social class or whether one lives in the city or the country  That the Chilean population was largely formed in a small section at the center of the country and then migrated in modest numbers to the north and south helps explain this relative lack of differentiation  which was maintained by the national reach of radio  and now television  which also helps to diffuse and homogenize colloquial expressions  26  There are several indigenous languages spoken in Chile  Mapudungun  Quechua  Aymara and Rapa Nui  After the Spanish invasion  Spanish took over as the lingua franca and the indigenous languages have become minority languages  with some now extinct or close to extinction  142  German is still spoken to some extent in southern Chile  143  either in small country side pockets or as a second language among the communities of larger cities  Through initiatives such as the English Opens Doors program  the government made English mandatory for students in fifth grade and above in public schools  Most private schools in Chile start teaching English from kindergarten  144  Common English words have been absorbed and appropriated into everyday Spanish speech  145  In 2010  all students from 3rd grade in  Ense anza Media   secondary school  will be tested on listening and reading comprehension  The evaluation is compulsory and the
