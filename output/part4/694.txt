recognised by Russia  Nicaragua  Venezuela  Nauru  Tuvalu and Vanuatu 11  12  and also by the partially recognised states of South Ossetia  Transnistria and Nagorno Karabakh  13  The Georgian government and the majority of the world s governments consider Abkhazia a part of Georgia s territory  14  Under Georgia s official designation it is an autonomous republic  called the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia  whose government sits in exile in Tbilisi  On 28 August 2008  the Parliament of Georgia passed a resolution declaring Abkhazia a  Russian occupied territory   15  16  The status of Abkhazia is a central issue of the Georgian Abkhazian conflict  The wider region formed part of the Soviet Union until 1991  As the Soviet Union began to disintegrate towards the end of the 1980s  ethnic tensions grew between Abkhaz and Georgians over Georgia s moves towards independence  This led to the 1992 1993 War in Abkhazia that resulted in a Georgian military defeat  de facto independence of Abkhazia and the mass exodus and ethnic cleansing of the Georgian population from Abkhazia  In spite of the 1994 ceasefire agreement and years of negotiations  the status dispute has not been resolved  and despite the long term presence of a United Nations monitoring force and a Russian dominated CIS peacekeeping operation  the conflict has flared up on several occasions  In August 2008  the sides again fought during the South Ossetia War  which was followed by the formal recognition of Abkhazia by Russia  the annulment of the 1994 cease fire agreement and the termination of the UN and CIS missions  citation needed  Contents 1 Naming 2 History 2 1 Early history 2 2 Abkhazia within the Russian Empire and Soviet Union 2 3 Abkhazia in post Soviet Georgia 2 4 The Abkhazian

was part of the ancient Georgian 19  20  21  kingdom of Colchis   Kolkha    22  This kingdom was subsequently absorbed in 63 BC into the Kingdom of Egrisi  known to Byzantine authors as  Lazica  and to the Persians as  Lazistan   named after the Laz tribe  23  24  Between 1000 and 550 BC  Greeks established trade colonies along the coast of the Black Sea  in particular at Pitiunt and Dioscurias  which was to become the capital of modern day Abkhazia  They encountered local warlike tribes who they called Heniochi  citation needed  Classical authors described various peoples living in the region and the great multitude of languages they spoke  citation needed Arrian  Pliny and Strabo have given accounts of the Abasgoi 25   generally considered ancestors of the modern Abkhazians  and Moschoi 26   generally considered as ancestors of Meskhetians  peoples somewhere in modern Abkhazia on the eastern shore of the Black Sea  The Roman Empire conquered Egrisi in the 1st century AD and ruled it until the 4th century  following which it regained a measure of independence  but remained within the Byzantine Empire s sphere of influence  Although the exact time when the population of Abkhazia was converted to Christianity has not been determined  it is known that the Metropolitan of Pitius participated in the First Ecumenical Council in 325 in Nicaea  citation needed  Abkhazia  or Abasgia in classic sources  citation needed  formerly part of Colchis and later of Egrisi  Lazica  until the late 690s  was a princedom under Byzantine authority  Anacopia was the princedom s capital  The country was mostly Christian with the archbishop s seat in Pityus  22  An Arab incursion into Abkhazia was repelled by Leon I jointly with his Egrisian and Kartlian allies in 736  After acquiring Egrisi via a dynastic union in the 780s 27  Abkhazia became the dominant power in the region and the Kingdom of Abkhazia  also known as the Kingdom of Egrisi or the Kingdom of the Abkhaz  was established  During this period the Georgian language replaced Greek as the language of literacy and culture  28  The kingdom flourished between 850 and 950 when it annexed significant parts of Eastern Georgia including Tbilisi  A period of unrest ensued  which ended as Abkhazia and eastern Georgian states were unified under a single Georgian monarchy  ruled by King Bagrat III  who was buried in the Monastery of Bedia in the Tkvarcheli district of Abkhazia  at the end of the 10th century and the beginning of the 11th century  In the 16th century  after the break up of the Georgian Kingdom  an autonomous Principality of Abkhazia emerged  ruled by the Shervashidze dynasty  also known as Sharvashidze  or Chachba   citation needed  Since the 1570s  when the Ottoman navy occupied the fort of Tskhumi  Abkhazia came under the influence of the Ottoman Empire and Islam  Under Ottoman rule  the majority of Abkhazians were converted to Islam  The principality retained a degree of autonomy under the Ottomans  and then Russian rule  but it was eventually absorbed into the Russian Empire in 1864  22   edit  Abkhazia within the Russian Empire and Soviet Union Abkhazia in 1899 In the beginning of the 19th century while the Russians and Ottomans were vying for control of the region  the rulers of Abkhazia shifted back and forth across the religious divide  citation needed  The first attempt to enter into relations with Russia was made by Keilash Bey in 1803  shortly after the incorporation of eastern Georgia into the expanding Tsarist empire  1801   However  the pro Ottoman orientation prevailed for a short time after his assassination by his son Aslan Bey on 2 May 1808  citation needed  On 2 July 1810  the Russian Marines stormed Suhum Kale and had Aslan Bey replaced with his rival brother  Sefer Bey  1810 1821   who had converted to Christianity and assumed the name of George  Abkhazia joined the Russian Empire as an autonomous principality  However  George s rule  as well as that of his successors  was limited to the neighbourhood of Suhum Kale and the Bzyb area  citation needed  The next Russo Turkish war strongly enhanced the Russian positions  leading to a further split in the Abkhaz elite  mainly along religious divisions  During the Crimean War  1853 1856   Russian forces had to evacuate Abkhazia and Prince Michael  1822 1864  seemingly switched to the Ottomans  citation needed  Later on  the Russian presence strengthened and the highlanders of Western Caucasia were finally subjugated by Russia in 1864  citation needed  The autonomy of Abkhazia  which had functioned as a pro Russian  buffer zone  in this troublesome region  was no longer needed by the Tsarist government and the rule of the Shervashidze came to an end  in November 1864  Prince Michael was forced to renounce his rights and resettle in Voronezh  citation needed  Abkhazia was incorporated into the Russian Empire as a special military province of Suhum Kalem which was transformed  in 1883  into an okrug as part of the Kutais Guberniya  Large numbers of Muslim Abkhazians  said to have constituted as much as 40  of the Abkhazian population  emigrated to the Ottoman Empire between 1864 and 1878 with other Muslim population of Caucasus  a process known as Muhajirism  Large areas of the region were left uninhabited and many Armenians  Georgians  Russians and others subsequently migrated to Abkhazia  resettling much of the vacated territory  29  According to Georgian historians  Georgian tribes  namely the Mingrelians and Svans  had populated Abkhazia

independent Georgia  which included Abkhazia  in 1918  Georgia s Menshevik government had problems with the area through most of its existence despite a limited autonomy being granted to the region  In 1921  the Bolshevik Red Army invaded Georgia and ended its short lived independence  Abkhazia was made a Socialist Soviet Republic  SSR Abkhazia  with the ambiguous status of a treaty republic associated with the Georgian SSR  31  32  In 1931  Stalin made it an autonomous republic  Abkhaz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic or in short Abkhaz ASSR  within the Georgian SSR  22  Despite its nominal autonomy  it was subjected to strong direct rule from central Soviet authorities  Under the rule of Stalin and Beria Abkhaz schools were closed  33  34  35  Russians also moved into Abkhazia in great numbers  Later  in the 1950s and 1960s  Vazgen I and the Armenian church encouraged and funded the migration of Armenians to Abkhazia  citation needed  Currently  Armenians are the second largest minority group in Abkhazia  closely matching the Georgians   although their numbers decreased dramatically from 77 000 in the 1989 census to 45 000 in the 2003 census  see the Demographics   The oppression of the Abkhaz was ended after Stalin s death 22  and Beria s execution  and the Abkhaz were given a greater role in the governance of the republic  22  As in most of the smaller autonomous republics  the Soviet government encouraged the development of culture and particularly of literature   edit  Abkhazia in post Soviet Georgia Flag of the SSR Abkhazia in 1989 Main article  Georgian Abkhaz conflict As the Soviet Union began to disintegrate at the end of the 1980s  ethnic tensions grew between the Abkhaz and Georgians over Georgia s moves towards independence  Many Abkhaz opposed this  fearing that an independent Georgia would lead to the elimination of their autonomy  and argued instead for the establishment of Abkhazia as a separate Soviet republic in its own right  The dispute turned violent on 16 July 1989 in Sukhumi  Sixteen Georgians are said to have been killed and another 137 injured when they tried to enroll in a Georgian University instead of an Abkhaz one  After several days of violence  Soviet troops restored order in the city and blamed rival nationalist paramilitaries for provoking confrontations  In March 1990  Georgia declared sovereignty  unilaterally nullifying treaties concluded by the Soviet government since 1921 and thereby moving closer to independence  The Republic of Georgia boycotted the 17 March 1991 all Union referendum on the renewal of the Soviet Union called by Mikhail Gorbachev  however  52 3  of Abkhazia s population  almost all of the ethnic non Georgian population  took part in the referendum and voted by an overwhelming majority  98 6   to preserve the Union  36  37  Most ethnic non Georgians in Abkhazia later boycotted a 31 March referendum on Georgia s independence  which was supported by a huge majority of Georgia s population  Within weeks  Georgia declared independence on 9 April 1991  under former Soviet dissident Zviad Gamsakhurdia  Under Gamsakhurdia  the situation was relatively calm in Abkhazia and a power sharing agreement was soon reached between the Abkhaz and Georgian factions  granting to the Abkhaz a certain over representation in the local legislature  38  Gamsakhurdia s rule was soon challenged by armed opposition groups  under the command of Tengiz Kitovani  that forced him to flee the country in a military coup in January 1992  Former Soviet foreign minister and architect of the disintegration of the USSR Eduard Shevardnadze replaced Gamsakhurdia as president  inheriting a government dominated by hard line Georgian nationalists  He was not an ethnic nationalist but did little to avoid being seen as supporting his administration s dominant figures and the leaders of the coup that swept him to power  citation needed  On 21 February 1992  Georgia s ruling Military Council announced that it was abolishing the Soviet era constitution and restoring the 1921 Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Georgia  Many Abkhaz interpreted this as an abolition of their autonomous status  although the 1921 constitution contained a provision for the region s autonomy  39  On 23 July 1992  the Abkhaz faction in the republic s Supreme Council declared effective independence from Georgia  although the session was boycotted by ethnic Georgian deputies and the gesture went unrecognised by any other country  The Abkhaz leadership launched a campaign of ousting Georgian officials from their offices  a process which was accompanied by violence  In the meantime  the Abkhaz leader Vladislav Ardzinba intensified his ties with hardline Russian politicians and military elite and declared he was ready for a war with Georgia  40   edit  The Abkhazian War Main article  War in Abkhazia In August 1992  the Georgian government accused Gamsakhurdia s supporters of kidnapping Georgia s Interior Minister and holding him captive in Abkhazia  The Georgian government dispatched 3 000 troops to the region  ostensibly to restore order  The Abkhaz were relatively unarmed at this time and the Georgian troops were able to march into Sukhumi with relatively little resistance 41  and subsequently engaged in ethnically based pillage  looting  assault  and murder  42  The Abkhaz units were forced to retreat to Gudauta and Tkvarcheli  The Abkhaz military defeat was met with a hostile response by the self styled Confederation of Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus  an umbrella group uniting a number of movements in the North Caucasus  including elements of Circassians  Abazins  Chechens  Cossacks  Ossetians and hundreds of volunteer paramilitaries and mercenaries from Russia  including the then little known Shamil Basayev  later a leader of the anti Moscow Chechen secessionists  They sided with the Abkhaz separatists to fight against the Georgian government  In the case of Basayev  it has been suggested that when he and the members of his battalion came to Abkhazia  they received training by the Russian Army  though others dispute this   presenting another possible motive  43  Regular Russian forces also reportedly sided with the secessionists  citation needed  In September  the Abkhaz and Russian paramilitaries mounted a major offensive against Gagra after breaking a cease fire  which drove the Georgian forces out of large swathes of the republic  Shevardnadze s government accused Russia of giving covert military support to the rebels with the aim of  detaching from Georgia its native territory and the Georgia Russian frontier land   1992 ended with the rebels in control of much of Abkhazia northwest of Sukhumi  The conflict was in stalemate until July 1993  when Abkhaz separatist militias launched an abortive attack on Georgian held Sukhumi  They surrounded and heavily shelled the capital  where Shevardnadze was trapped  The warring sides agreed to a Russian brokered truce in Sochi at the end of July  but it collapsed in mid September 1993 after a renewed Abkhaz attack  After ten days of heavy fighting  Sukhumi was taken by Abkhazian forces on 27 September 1993  Shevardnadze narrowly escaped death  after vowing to stay in the city no matter what  He was forced to flee when separatist snipers fired on the hotel where he was staying  Abkhaz  North Caucasian militants  and their allies committed numerous atrocities 44  against the city s remaining ethnic Georgians  in what has been dubbed the Sukhumi Massacre  The mass killings and destruction continued for two weeks  leaving thousands dead and missing  The Abkhaz forces quickly overran the rest of Abkhazia as the Georgian government faced a second threat  an uprising by the supporters of the deposed Zviad Gamsakhurdia in the region of Mingrelia  Samegrelo   Only a small region of eastern Abkhazia  the upper Kodori gorge  remained under Georgian control  until 2008   In the chaotic aftermath of defeat almost all ethnic Georgians fled the region  escaping an ethnic cleansing initiated by the victors  Many thousands died  it is estimated that on each side there were about 4 000 casualties  both military and civilian  44  During the war  gross human rights violations were reported on both sides  see Human Rights Watch report   44  Georgian troops have been accused of having committed looting 41  and murders  for the purpose of terrorising  robbing and driving the Abkhaz population out of their homes  44  in the first phase of the war  according to Human Rights Watch   while Georgia blames the Abkhaz forces and their allies for the ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia  which has also been recognised by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  OSCE  Summits in Budapest  1994   45 Lisbon  1996  46  and Istanbul  1999   47  Of about 200 000 240 000 Georgian refugees  some 60 000 Georgian refugees subsequently returned to Abkhazia s Gali district between 1994 and 1998  but tens of thousands were displaced again when fighting resumed in the Gali district in 1998  Nevertheless  between 40 000 and 60 000 refugees have returned to the Gali district since 1998  including persons commuting daily across the ceasefire line and those migrating seasonally in accordance with agricultural cycles  48  The human rights situation remained precarious for a while in the Georgian populated areas of the Gali district  The United Nations and other international organisations have been fruitlessly urging the Abkhaz de facto authorities  to refrain from adopting measures incompatible with the right to return and with international human rights standards  such as discriminatory legislation     and  to cooperate in the establishment of a permanent international human rights office in Gali and to admit United Nations civilian police without further delay   49  Key officials of the Gali district are virtually all ethnic Abkhaz  though their support staff are ethnic Georgian  50   edit  Post war Abkhazia Main article  Georgian Abkhaz conflict On 3 October 2004 presidential elections were held in Abkhazia  In the elections  Russia evidently supported Raul Khadjimba  the prime minister backed by the ailing outgoing separatist President Vladislav Ardzinba  Posters of Russia s President Vladimir Putin together with Khadjimba  who  like Putin  had worked as a KGB official  were everywhere in Sukhumi  citation needed  Deputies of Russia s parliament and Russian singers  led by Joseph Kobzon  a deputy and a popular singer  came to Abkhazia campaigning for Khadjimba  However Raul Khadjimba lost the elections to Sergei Bagapsh  The tense situation in the republic led to the cancellation of the election results by the Supreme Court  After that a deal was struck between former rivals to run jointly   Bagapsh as a presidential candidate and Khadjimba as a vice presidential candidate  They received more than 90  of the votes in the new election  citation needed  In July 2006  Georgian forces launched a successful police operation against the rebelled administrator of the Georgian populated Kodori Gorge  Emzar Kvitsiani  Kvitsiani had been appointed by the previous president of Georgia Edvard Shevardnadze and refused to recognise the authority of president Mikheil Saakashvili  who succeeded Shevardnadze after the Rose Revolution  Although Kvitsiani escaped capture by Georgian police  the Kodori Gorge was brought back under the control of the central government in Tbilisi  Sporadic acts of violence continued throughout the postwar years  Despite the peacekeeping status of the Russian peacekeepers in Abkhazia  Georgian officials routinely claimed that Russian peacekeepers were inciting violence by supplying Abkhaz rebels with arms and financial support  Russian support of Abkhazia became pronounced when the Russian ruble became the de facto currency and Russia began issuing passports to the population of Abkhazia  51  Georgia has also accused Russia of violating its airspace by sending helicopters to attack Georgian controlled towns in the Kodori Gorge  In April 2008  a Russian MiG   prohibited from Georgian airspace  including Abkhazia   shot down a Georgian UAV  52  53  On 9 August 2008  Abkhazian forces fired on Georgian forces in Kodori Gorge  This coincided with the 2008 South Ossetia war where Russia decided to support the Ossetian separatists who had been attacked by Georgia  citation needed  The conflict escalated into a full scale war between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Georgia  On 10 August 2008 an estimated 9 000 Russian troops entered Abkhazia ostensibly to reinforce the Russian peacekeepers in the republic  About 1 000 Abkhazian troops moved to expel the residual Georgian forces within Abkhazia in the Upper Kodori Gorge  54  By 12 August the Georgian forces and civilians had evacuated the last part of Abkhazia under Georgian government control  Russia recognised the independence of Abkhazia on 26 August 2008  55  56  Moreover  on 17 November 2008  the Abkhaz parliament ratified a bill that authorised the construction of a Russian military base in Abkhazia in 2009  citation needed  Since independence was recognised by Russia a series of controversial agreements were made between the Abkhazian government and the Russian Federation that leased or sold a number of key state assets and relinquished control over the borders  In May 2009 several opposition parties and war veteran groups protested against these deals complaining that they undermined state sovereignty and risked exchanging one colonial power  Georgia  for another  Russia   57  The Vice President  Raul Khadjimba  resigned on 28 May saying he agreed with the criticism the opposition had made  58  Subsequently  a conference of opposition parties nominated Raul Khadjimba as their candidate in the December 2009 Abkhazian presidential election won by Sergei Bagapsh   edit  International status Main article  International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia Main article  Foreign relations

recognised Abkhazia in September 2009  59  60  In December 2009  Nauru recognised Abkhazia  reportedly in return for  50 million in humanitarian aid from Russia  61  The unrecognised republic of Transnistria and the partially recognised republic of South Ossetia have recognised Abkhazia since 2006  Abkhazia  South Ossetia and Transnistria all belong to the Community for Democracy and Human Rights  a group that attempts to further the cause of unrecognised states that came from the former Soviet Union  Abkhazia is also a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization  UNPO   A majority of sovereign states recognise Abkhazia as an integral part of Georgia and support its territorial integrity according to the principles of international law  although Belarus has expressed sympathy toward the recognition of Abkhazia  62  63  The United Nations has been urging both sides to settle the dispute through diplomatic dialogue and ratifying the final status of Abkhazia in the Georgian constitution  44  64  However  the Abkhaz de facto government considers Abkhazia a sovereign country even if it is recognised by few other countries  In early 2000  then UN Special Representative of the Secretary General Dieter Boden and the Group of Friends of Georgia  consisting of the representatives of Russia  the United States  Britain  France  and Germany  drafted and informally presented a document to the parties outlining a possible distribution of competencies between the Abkhaz and Georgian authorities  based on a core respect for Georgian territorial integrity  The Abkhaz side  however  has never accepted the paper as a basis for negotiations  65  Eventually  Russia also withdrew its approval of the document  66  In 2005 and 2008  the Georgian government offered Abkhazia a high degree of autonomy and possible federal structure within the borders and jurisdiction of Georgia  On 18 October 2006  the People s Assembly of Abkhazia passed a resolution  calling upon Russia  international organisations  and the rest of the international community to recognise Abkhaz independence on the basis that Abkhazia possesses all the properties of an independent state  67  The United Nations has reaffirmed  the commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally recognised borders  and outlined the basic principles of conflict resolution which call for immediate return of all displaced persons and for non resumption of hostilities  68  Georgia accuses the Abkhaz secessionists of having conducted a deliberate campaign of ethnic cleansing of 200 000 240 000 Georgians citation needed   a claim supported by the OSCE  Budapest  Lisbon and Istanbul declaration   69  The UN Security Council has avoided use of the term  ethnic cleansing  but has affirmed  the unacceptability of the demographic changes resulting from the conflict   70  On 15 May 2008 United Nations General Assembly adopted a non binding resolution recognising the right of all refugees  including victims of reported  ethnic cleansing   to return to Abkhazia and their property rights  It  regretted  the attempts to alter pre war demographic composition and called for the  rapid development of a timetable to ensure the prompt voluntary return of all refugees and internally displaced persons to their homes   71  On 28 March 2008  the President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili unveiled his government s new proposals to Abkhazia  the broadest possible autonomy within the framework of a Georgian state  a joint free economic zone  representation in the central authorities including the post of vice president with the right to veto Abkhaz related decisions  72  The Abkhaz leader Sergei Bagapsh rejected these new initiatives as  propaganda   leading to Georgia s complaints that this skepticism was  triggered by Russia  rather than by real mood of the Abkhaz people   73  On 3 July 2008  the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly passed a resolution at its annual session in Astana  expressing concern over Russia s recent moves in breakaway Abkhazia  The resolution calls on the Russian authorities to refrain from maintaining ties with the breakaway regions  in any manner that would constitute a challenge to the sovereignty of Georgia  and also urges Russia  to abide by OSCE standards and generally accepted international norms with respect to the threat or use of force to resolve conflicts in relations with other participating States   74   edit  Russian involvement Leaders of Abkhazia  Russia

President Sergei Bagapsh  During the Georgian Abkhaz conflict  the Russian authorities and military supplied logistical and military aid to the separatist side  44  Today  Russia still maintains a strong political and military influence over separatist rule in Abkhazia  Russia has also issued passports for the citizens of Abkhazia since 2000  as the Abkhazian passports cannot be used for international travel  and subsequently paid retirement pensions and other monetary benefits  More than 80  of the Abkhazian population received Russian passports by 2006  As Russian citizens living abroad  Abkhazians do not pay Russian taxes or serve in the Russian Army  75  76  About 53 000 Abkhazian passports have been issued as of May 2007  77  Moscow  at certain times  had hinted that it might recognise Abkhazia and South Ossetia when the Western countries recognised the independence of Kosovo suggesting it created a precedent  Following Kosovo s declaration of independence the Russian parliament released a joint statement reading   Now that the situation in Kosovo has become an international precedent  Russia should take into account the Kosovo scenario   when considering ongoing territorial conflicts   78  Initially Russia continued to delay recognition of both of these republics  However  on 16 April 2008  the outgoing Russian president Vladimir Putin instructed his government to establish official ties with South Ossetia and Abkhazia  leading to Georgia s condemnation of what it described an attempt at  de facto annexation  79  and criticism from the European Union  NATO  and several Western governments  80  Later in April 2008  Russia accused Georgia of trying to exploit the NATO support in order to control Abkhazia by force  and announced it would increase its military in the region  pledging to retaliate militarily to Georgia s efforts  The Georgian Prime Minister Lado Gurgenidze had said Georgia will treat any additional troops in Abkhazia as  aggressors   81  In response to the Georgian invasion of South Ossetia  the Federal Assembly of Russia called an extraordinary session for 25 August 2008 to discuss recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia  82  Following a unanimous resolution that was passed by both houses of the parliament  calling on the Russian president to recognise independence of the breakaway republics  83  Russian president  Dmitry Medvedev  officially recognised both on 26 August 2008  84  85  Russian recognition 86  was condemned by NATO nations  OSCE  and European Council nations 87  88  89  90  91  due to

and based on autonomy for Abkhazia legitimised by referendum under international observation once the multi ethnic population has returned  100  According to Western interpretations the intervention

reassure the local population in the Gali district that their residency rights and identity will be respected  The Georgian side is  once again urged to address seriously legitimate Abkhaz security concerns  to avoid steps that could be seen as threatening and to refrain from militant rhetoric and provocative actions  especially in upper Kodori Valley   Calling on both parties to follow up on dialogue initiatives  it further urged them to comply fully with all previous agreements regarding non violence and confidence building  in particular those concerning the separation of forces

is bounded by the Georgian region of Samegrelo Zemo Svaneti  and on the south and southwest by the Black Sea  Abkhazia is extremely mountainous  The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range runs along the region s northern border  with its spurs   the Gagra  Bzyb and Kodori ranges   dividing the area into a number of deep  well watered valleys  The highest peaks of Abkhazia are in the northeast and east and several exceed 4 000 meters  13 123 ft  above sea level  The landscapes of Abkhazia range from coastal forests and citrus plantations  to eternal snows and glaciers to the north of the region  Although Abkhazia s complex topographic setting has spared most of the territory from significant human development  its cultivated fertile lands produce tea  tobacco  wine and fruits  a mainstay of the local agricultural sector  Abkhazia is richly irrigated by small rivers originating in the Caucasus Mountains  Chief of these are  Kodori  Bzyb  Ghalidzga  and Gumista  The Psou River separates the region from Russia  and the Inguri serves as a boundary between Abkhazia and Georgia proper  There are several periglacial and crater lakes in mountainous Abkhazia  Lake Ritsa is the most important of them  The world s deepest known cave  Krubera  Voronja  Cave   The Crows  Cave   in English   is located in Abkhazia s western Caucasus mountains  The latest survey  as of September 2006  has measured the vertical extent of this cave system as 2 158 meters  7 080 ft  between its highest and lowest explored points  118  Because of Abkhazia s proximity to the Black Sea and the shield of the Caucasus Mountains  the region s climate is very mild  The coastal areas of the republic have a subtropical climate  where the average annual temperature in most regions is around 15  C  59  F   The climate at higher elevations varies from maritime mountainous to cold and summerless  Abkhazia receives high amounts of precipitation  but its unique micro climate  transitional from subtropical
