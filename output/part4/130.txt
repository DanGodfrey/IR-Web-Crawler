largest city is Berlin  Germany covers an area of 357 021 km2 and has a largely temperate seasonal climate  With 81 8 million inhabitants  it is the most populous member state and the largest economy in the European Union  It is one of the major political powers of the European continent and a technological leader in many fields  A region named Germania  inhabited by several Germanic peoples  was documented before AD 100  During the Migration Age  the Germanic tribes expanded southward  and established successor kingdoms throughout much of Europe  Beginning in the 10th century  German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire  5  During the 16th century  northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation while southern and western parts remained dominated by Roman Catholic denominations  with the two factions clashing in the Thirty Years  War  marking the beginning of the Catholic Protestant divide that has characterized German society ever since  6  Occupied during the Napoleonic Wars  the rise of Pan Germanism inside the German Confederation resulted in the unification of most of the German states into the German Empire in 1871 which was Prussian dominated  After the German Revolution of 1918 1919 and the subsequent military surrender in World War I  the Empire was replaced by the Weimar Republic in 1918  and partitioned in the Versailles Treaty  Amidst the Great Depression  the Third Reich was proclaimed in 1933  The latter period was marked by Fascism and the Second World War  After 1945  Germany was divided by allied occupation  and evolved into two states  East Germany and West Germany  In 1990 Germany was reunified  Germany was a founding member of the European Community in 1957  which became the EU in 1993  It is part of the Schengen Area and since 1999 a member of the eurozone  Germany is a member of the United Nations  NATO  the G8  the G20  the OECD and the Council of Europe  and took

use after Julius Caesar adopted it for the peoples east of the Rhine  7  In other languages it has various names  The German term Deutschland  originally diutisciu land   the German lands   is derived from deutsch  descended from Old High German diutisc  popular   i  e   belonging to the diot or diota  people   originally used to distinguish the language of the common people from Latin and its Romance descendants   This in turn descends from Proto Germanic   iudiskaz  popular   see also the Latinised form Theodiscus   derived from   eud   descended from Proto Indo European  tewt h    people   8  History Main article  History of Germany Germanic tribes and Frankish Empire Main articles  Germania and Migration Period Map of the Germania and the Roman Empire The Germanic tribes are thought to date from the Nordic Bronze Age or the Pre Roman Iron Age  From southern Scandinavia and north Germany  they expanded south  east and west from the 1st century BC  coming into contact with the Celtic tribes of Gaul as well as Iranian  Baltic  and Slavic tribes in Eastern Europe  9  Under Augustus  the Roman General Publius Quinctilius Varus began to invade Germania  an area extending roughly from the Rhine to the Ural Mountains   In AD 9  three Roman legions led by Varus were defeated by the Cheruscan leader Arminius  By AD 100  when Tacitus wrote Germania  Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube  the Limes Germanicus   occupying most of the area of modern Germany  Austria  southern Bavaria and the western Rhineland  however  were Roman provinces  10  In the 3rd century a number of large West Germanic tribes emerged  Alamanni  Franks  Chatti  Saxons  Frisii  Sicambri  and Thuringii  Around 260  the Germanic peoples broke into Roman controlled lands  11  After the invasion of the Huns in 375  and with the decline of Rome from 395  Germanic tribes moved further south west  Simultaneously several large tribes formed in what is now Germany and displaced the smaller Germanic tribes  Large areas  known since the Merovingian period as Austrasia  were occupied by the Franks  and Northern Germany was ruled by the Saxons and Slavs  10  Holy Roman Empire Main article  Holy Roman Empire Martin Luther initiated the Protestant Reformation  On 25 December 800  Charlemagne founded the Carolingian Empire  which was divided in 843  12  The Holy Roman Empire resulted from the eastern portion of this division  Its territory stretched from the Eider River in the north to the Mediterranean coast in the south  12  Under the reign of the Ottonian emperors  919 1024   several major duchies were consolidated  and the German king was crowned Holy Roman Emperor of these regions in 962  The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and Burgundy under the reign of the Salian emperors  1024 1125   although the emperors lost power through the Investiture Controversy  Under the Hohenstaufen emperors  1138 1254   the German princes increased their influence further south and east into territories inhabited by Slavs  preceding German settlement in these areas and further east  Ostsiedlung   Northern German towns grew prosperous as members of the Hanseatic League  13  Starting with the Great Famine in 1315  then the Black Death of 1348 50  the population of Germany plummeted  14  The edict of the Golden Bull in 1356 provided the basic constitution of the empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven prince electors who ruled some of the most powerful principalities and archbishoprics  15  Martin Luther publicised his 95 Theses in 1517  challenging the Roman Catholic Church and initiating the Protestant Reformation  A separate Lutheran church became the official religion in many German states after 1530  Religious conflict led to the Thirty Years  War  1618 1648   which devastated German lands  16  The population of the German states was reduced by about 30   17  The Peace of Westphalia  1648  ended religious warfare among the German states  but the empire was de facto divided into numerous independent principalities  From 1740 onwards  dualism between the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy and the Kingdom of Prussia dominated German history  In 1806  the Imperium was overrun and dissolved as a result of the Napoleonic Wars  18  German Confederation and Empire Main articles  German Confederation  German Empire  and Pan Germanism Following the fall of Napoleon I of France  the Congress of Vienna convened in 1814 and founded the German Confederation  Deutscher Bund   a loose league of 39 sovereign states  Disagreement with restoration politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements  followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman Metternich  The Zollverein  a tariff union  furthered economic unity in the German states  19 National and liberal ideals of the French Revolution gained increasing support among many  especially young  Germans  In the light of a series of revolutionary movements in Europe  which established a republic in France  intellectuals and commoners started the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states  King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of Emperor  but with a loss of power  he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution  leading to a temporary setback for the movement  20  Foundation of the German Empire in Versailles  1871  Bismarck is at the centre in a white uniform  Conflict between King William I of Prussia and the increasingly liberal parliament erupted over military reforms in 1862  and the king appointed Otto von Bismarck the new Prime Minister of Prussia  Bismarck successfully waged war on Denmark in 1864  Prussian victory in the Austro Prussian War of 1866 enabled him to create the North German Federation  Norddeutscher Bund  and to exclude Austria  formerly the leading German state  from the federation s affairs  After the French defeat in the Franco Prussian War  the German Empire was proclaimed 1871 in Versailles  uniting all scattered parts of Germany except Austria  Kleindeutschland  or  Lesser Germany    With almost two thirds of its territory and population  Prussia was the dominating constituent of the new state  the Hohenzollern King of Prussia ruled as its concurrent Emperor  and Berlin became its capital  20  In the Gr nderzeit period following the unification of Germany  Bismarck s foreign policy as Chancellor of Germany under Emperor William I secured Germany s position as a great nation by forging alliances  isolating France by diplomatic means  and avoiding war  Under Wilhelm II  however  Germany  like other European powers  took an imperialistic course leading to friction with neighbouring countries  As a result of the Berlin Conference in 1884 Germany claimed several colonies including German East Africa  German South West Africa  Togo  and Cameroon  21  Most alliances in which Germany had previously been involved were not renewed  and new alliances excluded the country  22  The assassination of Austria s crown prince on 28 June 1914 triggered World War I  Germany  as part of the Central Powers  suffered defeat against the Allies in one of the bloodiest conflicts of all time  An estimated two million German soldiers died in World War I  23  The German Revolution broke out in November 1918  and Emperor Wilhelm II and all German ruling princes abdicated  An armistice ended the war on 11 November  and Germany was forced to sign the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919  The treaty was perceived in Germany as a humiliating continuation of the war  and is often cited as an influence in the rise of Nazism  24  Weimar Republic and Nazi Regime Main articles  Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany Adolf Hitler  chancellor and president11933 1945 1  office formally vacant from August 1934  Hitler styled himself  F hrer und Reichskanzler  25  At the beginning of the German Revolution in November 1918  Germany was declared a republic  However  the struggle for power continued  with radical left communists seizing power in Bavaria  The revolution came to an end on 11 August 1919  when the democratic Weimar Constitution was signed by President Friedrich Ebert  26  Suffering from the Great Depression of 1929  the harsh peace conditions dictated by the Treaty of Versailles  and a long succession of unstable governments  Germans increasingly lacked identification with the government  This was exacerbated by a widespread right wing Dolchsto legende  or stab in the back myth  which argued that Germany had lost World War I because of those who wanted to overthrow the government  The Weimar government was accused of betraying Germany by signing the Versailles Treaty  By 1932  the German Communist Party and the Nazi Party controlled the majority of parliament  fuelled by discontent with the Weimar government  After a series of unsuccessful cabinets  President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933  27  On 27 February 1933 the Reichstag building went up in flames  and a consequent emergency decree abrogated basic citizens  rights  An Enabling Act passed in parliament gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power  Only the Social Democratic Party voted against it  while Communist MPs had already been imprisoned  28  29  Using his powers to crush any actual or potential resistance  Hitler established a centralised totalitarian state within months  Industry was revitalised with a focus on military rearmament  30  In 1935  Germany reacquired control of the Saar and in 1936 military control of the Rhineland  both of which had been lost in the Treaty of Versailles  31  In 1938  Austria was annexed  and in 1939  Czechoslovakia was brought under German control  The invasion of Poland was prepared through the Molotov Ribbentrop pact and Operation Himmler  On 1 September 1939 the German Wehrmacht launched a blitzkrieg on Poland  which was swiftly occupied by Germany and by the Soviet Red Army  The UK and France declared war on Germany  marking the beginning of World War II  32  As the war progressed  Germany and its allies quickly gained control of most of continental Europe and North Africa  though plans to force the United Kingdom to an armistice or surrender failed  On 22 June 1941  Germany broke the Molotov Ribbentrop pact and invaded the Soviet Union  Japan s attack on Pearl Harbor led Germany to declare war on the United States  The Battle of Stalingrad forced the German army to retreat on the Eastern front  32  In September 1943  Germany s ally Italy surrendered  and German troops were forced to defend an additional front in Italy  D Day opened a Western front  as Allied forces advanced towards German territory  On 8 May 1945  the German armed forces surrendered after the Red Army occupied Berlin  33  Berlin in ruins after World War II In what later became known as The Holocaust  the Third Reich regime had enacted policies directly subjugating many dissidents and minorities  Millions of people were murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust  including approximately six million Jews  and a sizeable number of Romani people  Jehovah s Witnesses  Poles and other Slavs  Soviet POWs  people with mental and or physical disabilities  homosexuals  and members of the political and religious opposition  34  World War II was responsible for more than 40 million dead in Europe  35  The Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals were held after World War II  36  The war casualties for Germany are estimated at 5 3 million German soldiers 37  millions of German civilians  38  39  40  41  42  and losing the war resulted in large territorial losses  the expulsion of about 15 million Germans from the eastern areas of Germany and other countries  mass rape of German women  43  and the destruction of multiple major cities  East and West Germany Main article  History of Germany  1945 1990  Occupation zones in Germany  1947  The territories east of the Oder Neisse line  under Polish and Soviet de jure administration and de facto annexation  are shown as white as is the detached Saar protectorate  After the surrender of Germany  the remaining German territory and Berlin were partitioned by the Allies into four military occupation zones  The western sectors  controlled by France  the United Kingdom  and the United States  were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the Federal Republic of Germany  Bundesrepublik Deutschland   on 7 October 1949  the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic  Deutsche Demokratische Republik  or DDR   They were informally known as  West Germany  and  East Germany   East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital  while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital  to emphasise its stance that the two state solution was an artificial and temporary status quo  44  West Germany  established as a federal parliamentary republic with a  social market economy   was allied with the United States  the UK and France  The country enjoyed prolonged economic growth beginning in the early 1950s  Wirtschaftswunder   West Germany joined NATO in 1955 and was a founding member of the European Economic Community in 1957  East Germany was an Eastern bloc state under political and military control by the USSR via the latter s occupation forces and the Warsaw Pact  Though East Germany claimed to be a democracy  political power was exercised solely by leading members  Politb ro  of the communist controlled Socialist Unity Party of Germany  SED   supported by the Stasi  an immense secret service  45  and a variety of sub organisations controlling every aspect of society  A Soviet style command economy was set up  the GDR later became a Comecon state  46  While East German propaganda was based on the benefits of the GDR s social programmes and the alleged constant threat of a West German invasion  many of her citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity  47  The Berlin Wall  built in 1961 to stop East Germans from escaping to West Germany  became a symbol of the Cold War  20  The Berlin Wall in front of the Brandenburg Gate shortly before its fall in 1989 Tensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the early 1970s by Chancellor Willy Brandt s Ostpolitik  In summer 1989  Hungary decided to dismantle the Iron Curtain and open the borders  causing the emigration of thousands of East Germans to West Germany via Hungary  This had devastating effects on the GDR  where regular mass demonstrations received increasing support  The East German authorities unexpectedly eased the border restrictions  allowing East German citizens to travel to the West  originally intended to help retain East Germany as a state  the opening of the border actually led to an acceleration of the Wende reform process  This culminated in the Two Plus Four Treaty a year later on 12 September 1990  under which the four occupying powers renounced their rights under the Instrument of Surrender  and Germany regained full sovereignty  This permitted German reunification on 3 October 1990  with the accession of the five re established states of the former GDR  new states or  neue L nder    20  Berlin Republic and the EU Main article  History of Germany since 1990 Based on the Berlin Bonn Act  adopted on 10 March 1994  Berlin once again became the capital of the reunified Germany  while Bonn obtained the unique status of a Bundesstadt  federal city  retaining some federal ministries  48  The relocation of the government was completed in 1999  49  Since reunification  Germany has taken a more active role in the European Union and NATO  Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent a force of German troops to Afghanistan as part of a NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban  50  These deployments were controversial since  after the war  Germany was bound by domestic law only to deploy troops for defence roles  51  In 2005  Angela Merkel became the first female Chancellor of Germany as the leader of a grand coalition  20

decisions surrounding the Kosovo War and by sending German troops into combat for the first time since World War II  78  The governments of Germany and the United States are close political allies  20  The 1948 Marshall Plan and strong cultural ties have crafted a strong bond between the two countries  although Schr der s vocal opposition to the Iraq War suggested the end of Atlanticism and a
