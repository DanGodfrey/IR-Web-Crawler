feel secure in his life and plans to propose to Mary Jane Watson  who has just recently made her Broadway musical debut  While Peter and Mary Jane are on a date  a small meteorite crashes nearby  and an extraterrestrial symbiote attaches itself to Peter s moped  Meanwhile  while being pursued by the police  escaped convict Flint Marko falls into a particle accelerator  which fuses his body with the surrounding sand  The result allows him to shapeshift at will  becoming the Sandman  Peter s best friend  Harry Osborn  who seeks vengeance for his father s death  which he believes Peter caused  attacks him using new weapons adapted from the Green Goblin technology his father had left behind  During the scuffle  Harry injures his head and suffers from partial amnesia  making him forget his feud and the fact that Peter is Spider Man  Later  during a festival honoring Spider Man for saving Gwen Stacy s life  Sandman attempts to rob an armored car  and overpowers Spider Man  NYPD Captain George Stacy  Gwen s father  later informs Peter and Aunt May that Ben Parker s killer was actually Flint Marko  and that the now deceased Dennis Carradine was merely an accomplice  A vengeful Peter waits for Marko to strike again as the symbiote bonds with his costume while he is asleep  Peter wakes up hanging from a skyscraper in central Manhattan and discovers that not only has his costume changed  but his powers have been enhanced as well  The symbiotic black suit brings out the more vengeful  selfish and arrogant side of Peter s personality  Wearing the new suit  Spider Man locates Marko  fights him in a cavernous underground subway tunnel and  upon discovering that water can dissolve Marko s body  rips open a large water pipe to deliver what he believes to be a lethal torrent of water  reducing the Sandman to mud  The shift in Peter s personality alienates Mary Jane  whose career is floundering  and she finds solace with Harry  Harry recovers from his amnesia and  urged on by an apparition of his dead father  forces Mary Jane to break up with Peter  After Mary Jane leaves Peter  stating she is in love with another guy  Harry meets him at a restaurant and claims to be the other guy  Later  Peter confronts him at the Osborn mansion  With the help of the black suit  Peter is victorious in a brutal fight  which leaves Harry s face disfigured due to an explosion from one of his own pumpkin bombs  Influenced by the suit  Peter exposes and humiliates Eddie Brock  a rival freelance photographer  who has just gained overnight star status at the Daily Bugle by submitting doctored photographs from one of Marko s heists supposedly exposing Spider Man as a criminal  furious at now having to print a retraction  J  Jonah Jameson fires Eddie  Peter changes how he dresses and alters his hairstyle and begins to behave arrogantly  Meanwhile  the Sandman recovers from his injuries  having survived Spider Man s attack  In an effort to make Mary Jane jealous  Peter brings Gwen to the nightclub where Mary Jane works  Gwen catches on to the ploy and storms out leaving Peter to confront Mary Jane  During this  he gets into a fight with the club s bouncers and accidentally slaps Mary Jane  knocking her to the floor  Peter realizes the symbiote is changing him for the worse  He walks out of the nightclub and goes to a church bell tower to dispose of it  Initially  he is unable to remove the suit  but the alien eventually weakens due to the loud sounds of the bell  enabling Peter to break free  Eddie Brock  by chance  is at the same church praying for Peter s death when the symbiote falls from the tower and takes over his body  Eddie  now reincarnated as Venom  finds the Sandman and suggests joining forces to destroy Spider Man  to which the Sandman agrees  The pair put Mary Jane in a taxicab and hang it from a gigantic web above a construction site filled with sand  Peter approaches Harry for help  but is turned down  However  Harry learns the truth about his father s death from his butler Bernard  and arrives in time to rescue Peter  they form an alliance against the two villains  As the fight progresses  Harry temporarily subdues a gigantic  monstrous incarnation of the Sandman  and Venom attempts to impale Peter with Harry s glider  but Harry jumps in the way and is mortally wounded  suffering the same fate as his father  During his fight with Venom  Peter notices that the resonance made by falling pipes to distress the symbiote  and recalling how the church bell s toll weakened it  creates a ring of pipes around Venom to make a fence of sonic vibrations  The alien succumbs to so much pain that it releases Brock  and Peter pulls Eddie away from it with a string of web  Peter throws one of Harry s pumpkin bombs at the symbiote  but Eddie jumps into the ring in an attempt to rebond with it  and they are both killed in the resulting explosion  After the battle  Flint Marko recovers and tells Peter that he had no intention of killing Ben Parker  but rather  shot him by accident when Dennis grabbed his arm  and that it was an accident born out of a desperate attempt to save his dying daughter s life  He claims that Ben Parker s death has haunted him ever since then  Peter forgives Marko  who dissipates and floats away  Peter and Harry forgive each other before Harry dies with Mary Jane and Peter at his side  They attend Harry s funeral along with Aunt May  Bernard  and the Stacys  A few days later  Peter walks into the jazz bar where Mary Jane is singing  They embrace  begin to dance and begin to improve on their relationship   edit  Cast Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker   Spider Man  A superhero  a brilliant physics student at Columbia University  and photographer for the

Production  edit  Development  The most important thing Peter right now has to learn is that this whole concept of him as the avenger or him as the hero  he wears this red and blue outfit  with each criminal he brings to justice he s trying to pay down this debt of guilt he feels about the death of Uncle Ben  He considers himself a hero and a sinless person versus these villains that he nabs  We felt it would be a great thing for him to learn a little less black and white view of life and that he s not above these people    Sam Raimi 17  In March 2004  with Spider Man 2 being released the coming June  Marvel Studios had begun developing Spider Man 3 for a release in 2007  18  By the release of Spider Man 2  a release date for Spider Man 3 had been set for May 2  2007 before production on the sequel had begun  19  The date was later changed to May 4  2007  In January 2005  Sony Pictures Entertainment completed a seven figure deal with screenwriter Alvin Sargent  who had penned Spider Man 2  to work on Spider Man 3 with an option to write a fourth film  20  Immediately after Spider Man 2 s release  Ivan Raimi wrote a treatment over two months  4  with Sam Raimi deciding to use the film to explore Peter learning that he is not a sinless vigilante  and that there also can be humanity in those he considers criminals  17 Harry Osborn was brought back as Raimi wanted to conclude his storyline  17  Raimi felt that Harry would not follow his father s legacy  but be instead  somewhere between   21 Sandman was introduced as an antagonist  as Raimi found him a visually fascinating character  17  While Sandman is a petty criminal in the comics  the screenwriters created a background of the character being Uncle Ben s killer to increase Peter s guilt over his death 22  and challenge his simplistic perception of the event  17  Overall  Raimi described the film as being about Peter  Mary Jane  Harry  and the Sandman  23  with Peter s journey being one of forgiveness  11  Raimi wanted another villain  and Ben Kingsley was involved in negotiations to play the Vulture before the character was cut  4  Producer Avi Arad convinced Raimi to include Venom  a character whose perceived  lack of humanity  had initially been criticized by Sam Raimi  12  Venom s alter ego  Eddie Brock  already had a minor role in the script  24  Arad told the director that Venom had a strong fan base  so Raimi included the character to please them  23  and even began to appreciate the character himself  12  The film s version of the character is an amalgamation of Venom stories  Eddie Brock  Jr   the human part of Venom  serves as a mirror to Peter Parker  with both characters having similar jobs and romantic interests  12  Brock s actions as a journalist in Spider Man 3 also represent contemporary themes of paparazzi and tabloid journalism  5  The producers also suggested adding rival love interest Gwen Stacy  filling in an  other girl  type that Raimi already created  23  With so many additions  Sargent soon found his script so complex that he considered splitting it into two films  but abandoned the idea when he could not create a successful intermediate climax  4   edit  Filming Camera crews spent ten days from November 5  2005 to November 18  2005  to film sequences that would involve intense visual effects so Sony Pictures Imageworks could begin work on the shots early in the project  The same steps had been taken for Spider Man 2 to begin producing visual effects early for sequences involving the villain Doctor Octopus  25  Principal photography for Spider Man 3 began on January 16  2006 and wrapped in July 2006 after over a hundred days of filming  The team filmed in Los Angeles until May 19  2006  25  In spring 2006  film location manager Peter Martorano brought camera crews to Cleveland  26  due to the Greater Cleveland Film Commission offering production space at the city s convention center at no cost  27  In Cleveland  they shot the battle between Spider Man and Sandman in the armored car  4  Afterwards  the team moved to Manhattan  where filming took place from May 26  2006 until July 1  2006  25  Shooting placed a strain on Raimi  who often had to move between several units to complete the picture  4  Shooting was also difficult for cinematographer Bill Pope  as the symbiote Spider Man  Venom  and the New Goblin were costumed in black during fight scenes taking place at night  28  After August  pick ups were conducted as Raimi sought to film more action scenes  29  The film then wrapped in October  although in the following month  additional special effects shots were taken to finalize the production  30  At the start of 2007  there were further pick up shots regarding the resolution of Sandman s story  amounting to four different versions  7   edit  Effects Amputee boxer Baxter Humby  as Spider Man  throws a computer generated punch through the chest of Sandman  portrayed by Thomas Haden Church  John Dykstra  who won the Academy Award for Visual Effects for his work on Spider Man 2  declined to work on the third film as visual effects supervisor  Dykstra s colleague  Scott Stokdyk  took his place as supervisor  31  leading two hundred programmers at Sony Pictures Imageworks  This group designed specific computer programs that did not exist when Spider Man 3 began production  creating nine hundred visual effects shots  32  Concept art of the Venom suit  which possesses a webbing motif  unlike the comics  in order to show the symbiote s control and represent the character as a twisted foil to Spider Man  In addition to the innovative visual effects for the film  Stokdyk created a miniature of a skyscraper section at 1 16 scale with New Deal Studios  Ian Hunter and David Sanger  Stokdyk chose to design the miniature instead of using computer generated imagery so damage done to the building could be portrayed realistically and timely without guesswork involving computer models  33  In addition  to Sony Imageworks  Cafe FX provided visual effects for the crane disaster scene when Spider Man rescues Gwen Stacy  as well as shots in the climactic battle  34  To understand the effects of sand for the Sandman  experiments were done with twelve types of sand  such as splashing  launching it at stuntmen  and pouring it over ledges  The results were mimicked on the computer to create the visual effects for Sandman  32  For scenes involving visual effects  Thomas Haden Church was super imposed onto the screen  where computer generated imagery was then applied  6  With sand as a possible hazard in scenes that buried actors  ground up corncobs were used as a substitute instead  35  Because of its resemblance to the substance  sand from Arizona was used as the model for the CG sand  32  In a fight where Spider Man punches through Sandman s chest  amputee martial arts expert Baxter Humby took Tobey Maguire s place in filming the scene  Humby  whose right hand was amputated at birth  helped deliver the intended effect of punching through Sandman s chest  36  Whereas the symbiote suit worn in the comics by Spider Man was a plain black affair with a large white spider on the front and back  the design was changed for the film to become a black version of Spider Man s traditional costume  complete with webbing motif  As a consequence of this  the suit Topher Grace wore as Venom also bore the webbing motif  as producer Grant Curtis noted   it s the Spider Man suit  but twisted and mangled in its own right   37  Additionally  the motif gave a sense of life to the symbiote  giving it the appearance of gripping onto the character s body  38  When animating the symbiote  Raimi did not want it to resemble a spider or an octopus  and to give it a sense of character  The CG model is made of many separate strands  39  When animating Venom himself  animators observed footage of big cats such as lions and cheetahs for the character s agile movements  40   edit  Music Originally  Danny Elfman  the composer for the previous installments  did not plan to return for the third installment of Spider Man because of difficulties with director Sam Raimi  Elfman said that he had a  miserable experience  working with Raimi on Spider Man 2 and could not comfortably adapt his music  41 Christopher Young was then announced to score Spider Man 3 in Elfman s absence  42  In December 2006  however  producer Grant Curtis announced that Elfman had begun collaborating with Christopher Young on the music for Spider Man 3  43  Sandman s theme uses  two contrabass saxophones  two contrabass clarinets  two contrabass bassoons and eight very low French horns  to sound  low  aggressive and heavy   Young described Venom s theme as  Vicious  my instructions on that one were that he s the devil personified  His theme is much more demonic sounding   44  Venom s theme uses eight French horns  45  Raimi approved the new themes during their first performance  but rejected the initial music to the birth of Sandman  finding it too monstrous and not tragic enough  Young had to recompose much of his score at a later stage  as the producers felt there weren t enough themes from the previous films  44  Ultimately  new themes for the love story  Aunt May  and Mary Jane were dropped  45   edit  Reception Tobey Maguire greets fans at the premiere

accommodate the demand  57  The FX channel signed a five year deal for the television rights to Spider Man 3  which they began airing in 2009  The price was based on the film s box office performance

critics  67  Manohla Dargis of The New York Times deplored the film s pacing as  mostly just plods  and a lack of humor  68 Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film only 2 out of 4 stars  feeling   for every slam bang action sequence  there are far too many sluggish scenes   69 David Edelstein of New York magazine misses the  centrifugal threat  of Alfred Molina s character  adding that  the three villains here don t add up to one Doc Ock   70 James Berardinelli felt director Sam Raimi  overreached his grasp  by allowing so many villains  specifically saying   Venom is one bad guy too many   71 Roger Ebert thought Church never expressed how Sandman felt about his new powers  something Molina  as Doc Ock in Spider Man 2  did  with a vengeance   he claimed the film was  a mess   with too many villains  subplots  romantic misunderstandings  conversations and  street crowds looking high into the air and shouting  oooh   this way  then swiveling and shouting  aaah   that way   72 The New Yorker s Anthony Lane gave the film a mildly positive review  summarizing it as  shambles  which  makes the rules up as it goes along   73  However  Roger Friedman of Fox News called the film a  4 star opera   noting that while long  there was plenty of humor and action  74  Andy Khouri of Comic Book Resources praised the film as  easily the most complex and deftly orchestrated superhero epic ever filmed       despite the enormous amount of characters  action and sci fi superhero plot going on in this film  Spider Man 3 never feels weighted down  tedious or boring   75 Jonathan Ross  a big fan of the comic books  felt the film was the best of the trilogy  76 Richard Corliss of Time commended the filmmakers for their ability to  dramatize feelings of angst and personal betrayal worthy of an Ingmar Bergman film  and then to dress them up in gaudy comic book colors   77 Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe  who gave the film 4 out of 5 stars  wrote that it was a well made  fresh film  but would leave the viewer  overfulfilled   78  Jonathan Dean of Total Film felt the film s complex plot helped the film s pacing  in that   it rarely feels disjointed or loose       Spider Man cements its shelf life   79 Entertainment Weekly named the Sandman as the eighth best computer generated film character  80  John Hartl of MSNBC gave Spider Man 3 a good review  but stated that it has some flaws such as having  too many storylines   81  His opinion is echoed by Houston Chronicle s Amy Biancolli who complained that  the script is busy with so many supporting characters and plot detours that the series  charming idiosyncrasy is sometimes lost in the noise   82  Jack Matthews of Daily News thought the film was too devoted to the  quiet conversations  of Peter and Mary Jane  but that fans would not be disappointed by the action  83  Finally  Sean Burns of Philadelphia Weekly felt that the director  substituted scope and scale for the warmth and wit that made those two previous pictures so memorable   84   edit  Release  edit  Box office performance On its international opening day on May 1  2007 in 16 territories  Spider Man 3 grossed  29 2

Ziskin  Avi Arad  and Grant Curtis are among those who contributed to the audio commentaries  Sony announced plans to create  one of the largest  marketing campaigns in Hollywood for the October 30  2007 release of the DVD  Beginning with a partnership with Papa Johns  Sony printed close to 8 5 billion impressions for pizza boxes  television  radio  and online ads  Sony also worked with Pringles Potato Crisp  Blu Tack  Jolly Time Pop Corn  and Nutella  Sony s Vice President of marketing  Jennifer Anderson  stated the studio spend approximately 15  to 25  of its marketing budget on digital ad campaigns  from this  Papa Johns sent text messages to mobile phones with ads  Anderson stated that there would be three sweepstakes held for consumers  where they would be able to win prizes from Sony and its promotional partners  98  In the United States  the film grossed more than  124 million on DVD sales  99  It also grossed more than  43 76 million on DVD Home Video Rentals in 11 weeks  100  However  the DVD sales results of this film did not meet industry expectations  101   edit  Cancelled sequel In 2007  Spider Man 4 entered development  with Raimi attached to direct and Maguire  Dunst and other cast members set to reprise their roles  Both a fourth and a fifth movie were planned and at one time the idea of shooting the two sequels concurrently was under consideration  However  Raimi stated in March 2009 that only the fourth film was in development at that time and that if there were fifth and sixth films  those two films would actually be a continuation of each other  102  103  104  105 James Vanderbilt was hired in October 2007 to pen the screenplay after initial reports in early 2007 that Sony Pictures was in contact with David Koepp  who wrote the first Spider Man film  106  107  The script was subsequently rewritten by Pulitzer winning playwright David Lindsay Abaire and rewritten again by Gary Ross in October 2009  108  Sony also engaged Vanderbilt to write scripts for Spider Man 5 and Spider Man 6  107  In 2007  Raimi expressed interest in portraying the transformation of Dr  Curt Connors into his villainous alter ego  the Lizard  the character s actor Dylan Baker and producer Grant Curtis were also enthusiastic about the idea  109  110  111  It was reported in December 2009 that John Malkovich was in negotiations to play Vulture and that Anne Hathaway would play Felicia Hardy  though she would not have transformed into the Black Cat as in the comics  Instead  Raimi s Felicia was expected to become a brand new superpowered figure called the Vulturess  112  Sony Pictures announced in January 2010 that plans for Spider Man 4 had been cancelled due to Raimi s withdrawal from the project  Raimi reportedly ended his participation due to his doubt that he could meet the planned May 6  2011 release date while at the same time upholding the film creatively  Raimi purportedly went through four iterations of the script with different screenwriters and still  hated it   The next film in the franchise  a reboot of the series  called The Amazing Spider Man is set to be released in July 2012  with Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker   113
