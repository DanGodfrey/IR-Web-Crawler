character is presented as an adventurer reminiscent of the 1930s film serial treasure hunters and pulp action heroes  whose research is funded by Marshall College  named after producer Frank Marshall  18  a fictional college in Connecticut  where he is a professor of archaeology  In this first adventure  he is pitted against the Nazis  traveling the world to prevent them from recovering the Ark of the Covenant  see also Biblical archaeology   He is aided by Marion Ravenwood and Sallah  The Nazis are led by Jones s archrival  a Nazi sympathizing French archaeologist named Ren  Belloq  and Arnold Toht  a sinister Gestapo agent  The 1984 prequel  Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom  set in 1935  took the character into a more horror oriented story  skipping his legitimate teaching job and globe trotting  and taking place almost entirely in India  This time  Jones attempts to recover children and the Sankara stones from the bloodthirsty Thuggee cult  He is aided by Short Round and accompanied by Willie Scott  Kate Capshaw   The third film  1989 s Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  set in 1938  returned to the formula of the original  reintroducing characters such as Sallah and Marcus Brody  a scene from Professor Jones s classroom  he now teaches at Barnett College   the globe trotting element of multiple locations  and the return of the infamous Nazi mystics  this time trying to find the Holy Grail  The film s introduction  set in 1912  provided some back story to the character  specifically the origin of his fear of snakes  his use of a bullwhip  the scar on his chin  and his hat  the film s epilogue also reveals that  Indiana  is not Jones s first name  but a nickname he took from the family dog  The film was a buddy movie of sorts  teaming Jones with his father  often to comical effect  Although Lucas intended at the time to do five films  this ended up being the last for over eighteen years  as Lucas could not think of a good plot element to drive the next installment  19  The 2008 film  Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull  became the latest film in the series  Set in 1957  19 years after the third film  it pits an older  wiser Indiana Jones against Soviet agents bent on harnessing the power of a crystal skull discovered in South America by his former colleague Harold Oxley  John Hurt   He is aided in his adventure by an old lover  Marion Ravenwood  Karen Allen   and her son a young greaser named Henry  Mutt  Williams  Shia LaBeouf   later revealed to be his biological child  Henry Jones III  There were rumors that LaBeouf will take over the Indy franchise  20  This film also reveals that Jones was recruited by the Office of Strategic Services  a predecessor department to the CIA  during World War II  attaining the rank of Colonel in the United States Army and running covert operations with MI6 agent George McHale on the Soviet Union   edit  Television From 1992 to 1996  George Lucas executive produced a television series named The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles  which was designed as an educational program for children  spotlighting historical figures and important events  using the concept of a prequel to the films as a draw  The show featured a standard formula of a 93 year old Jones  George Hall   wearing an eye patch  introducing a story  and then an adventure with either a 17 year old Jones  Sean Patrick Flanery  or a 10 year old Jones  Corey Carrier   and even a baby Indy  Neil  Boulie  Boulane   Historical figures featured on the show include Mustafa Kemal Atat rk  Leo Tolstoy  Pancho Villa  Charles de Gaulle  Mata Hari  Eliot Ness  Ernest Hemingway  Jiddu Krishnamurti  Patrick Pearse  Emperor Karl and Empress Zita of Austria Hungary  Vladimir Lenin  T  E  Lawrence  Pablo Picasso  Igor Stravinsky  Winston Churchill  Herman G ring  Sigmund Freud  Theodore Roosevelt  Manfred von Richthofen  and John Ford  in such diverse locations as Egypt  India  China  and the whole of Europe  One episode   Young Indiana Jones and the Mystery of the Blues   is bookended by Harrison Ford  reprising his role as the character  Indiana loses one of his eyes sometime between 1957 and when the  Old Indy  segments take place  The show provided some backstory for the films  as well as new information regarding the character  He was born July 1  1899  and his middle name is Walton  Lucas s middle name   It is also mentioned that he had a sister called Suzie who died as an infant of fever  and that he eventually has a daughter and grandchildren who appear in some episode introductions and epilogues  His relationship with his father  first introduced in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  was further fleshed out with stories about his travels with his father as a young boy  A large portion of the series centered around his activities during World War I  In 1999  Lucas removed the episode introductions and epilogues by George Hall for the VHS and DVD releases  as he re edited the episodes into chronologically ordered feature length stories  The series title was also changed to The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones   edit  Video games The character has appeared in several officially licensed games  including LEGO Indiana Jones video games  beginning with adaptations of Raiders of the Lost Ark  Temple of Doom  two adaptations of The Last Crusade  one with purely action mechanics  one with an adventure and puzzle based structure  and Indiana Jones  Greatest Adventures which included the storylines from all three of the original films  Following this  the games branched off into original storylines with Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom  Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis  Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine  Indiana Jones and the Emperor s Tomb and Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings  21 Emperor s Tomb sets up Jones s companion Wu Han and the search for Nurhaci s ashes seen at the beginning of Temple of Doom  The first two games were developed by Hal Barwood and starred Doug Lee as the voice of Indiana Jones  Emperor s Tomb had David Esch fill the role and Staff of Kings starred John Armstrong  Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine was the first Indy based game presented in three dimensions  as opposed to 8 bit graphics and side scrolling games before  There is also a small game from Lucas Arts Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures  A video game was made for young Indy called Young Indiana Jones and the Instruments of Chaos  as well as a video game version of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles  Two Lego Indiana Jones games have also been released  Lego Indiana Jones  The Original Adventures was released in 2008 22  and follows the plots of the first three films  It was followed by LEGO Indiana Jones 2  The Adventure Continues in late 2009  The sequel includes an abbreviated reprise of the first three films  but focuses on the plot of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull  Indiana Jones has also made cameo appearances as an unlockable character in the games Mercenaries  Playground of Destruction and Lego Star Wars  The Complete Saga  Social gaming company Zynga introduced Indiana Jones to their  Adventure World  game in late 2011  23   edit  Theme parks Main article  Indiana Jones Adventure Indiana Jones is featured at several Walt Disney theme park attractions  The Indiana Jones Adventure attractions at Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea   Temple of the Forbidden Eye  and  Temple of the Crystal Skull   respectively  place Indy at the forefront of two similar archaeological discoveries  These two temples each contain a wrathful deity who threatens the guests who ride through in World War II troop transports  The attractions  some of the most expensive of their kind at the time  opened in 1995 and 2001  respectively  with sole design credit attributed to Walt Disney Imagineering  Disney did not license Harrison Ford s likeness for the North American version  nevertheless  a differentiated Indiana Jones audio animatronic character appears at three points in both attractions  However  the Indiana Jones featured in the DisneySea version does use Harrison Ford s likeness but uses Japanese audio for all of his speaking parts  In 2010  some of the Indy audio animatronics at the Disneyland version have been replaced and now resemble Ford  24  Disneyland Resort Paris also features an Indiana Jones titled ride where people speed off through ancient ruins in a runaway mine wagon similar to that found in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom  Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril is a looping roller coaster engineered by Intamin  designed by Walt Disney Imagineering  and opened in 1993  The Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular  is a live show that has been presented in the Disney s Hollywood Studios theme park of the Walt Disney World Resort with few changes since the park s 1989 opening under a different name  The 25 minute show presents various stunts framed in the context of a feature film production  and recruits members of the audience to participate in the show  Stunt artists in the show re create and ultimately reveal some of the secrets of the stunts of the Raiders of the Lost Ark films  including the well known  running from the boulder  scene  Stunt performer Anislav Varbanov was fatally injured in August 2009  while rehearsing the popular show  25  Also at Disney s Hollywood Studios  an audio animatronic Indiana Jones appears in another attraction  during the The Great Movie Ride s Raiders of the Lost Ark segment   edit  Character description and formation In his role as a college professor of archaeology  Henry Jones Jr  is scholarly and learned in a tweed suit  lecturing on ancient civilizations  In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull  it is revealed that Jones is influenced by the Marxist Archaeologist  Vere Gordon Childe  whose qualified acceptance of cultural diffusionism theory he propounds  Ironically  though Childe loathes fieldwork  26  Indy goes on to say   If you want to be a good archaeologist  you gotta get out of the library   This is in tongue in cheek contrast to the previous film s comment   Seventy percent of all archaeology is done in the library   However  at the opportunity to recover important artifacts  Dr  Jones transforms into  Indiana   a  non superhero superhero  image he has concocted for himself  27  Producer Frank Marshall said   Indy  is  a fallible character  He makes mistakes and gets hurt        That s the other thing people like  He s a real character  not a character with superpowers   28  Spielberg said there  was the willingness to allow our leading man to get hurt and to express his pain and to get his mad out and to take pratfalls and sometimes be the butt of his own jokes  I mean  Indiana Jones is not a perfect hero  and his imperfections  I think  make the audience feel that  with a little more exercise and a little more courage  they could be just like him   29  According to Spielberg biographer Douglas Brode  Indiana created his heroic figure so as to escape the dullness of teaching at a school  Both of Indiana s personas reject one another in philosophy  creating a duality  27  Harrison Ford said the fun of playing the character was because Indiana is both a romantic and a cynic  30  while scholars have analyzed Indiana as having traits of a lone wolf  a man on a quest  a noble treasure hunter  a hardboiled detective  a human superhero  and an American patriot  31  Like many characters in his films  Jones has some autobiographical elements of Spielberg  Indiana lacks a proper father figure because of his strained relationship with his father  Henry Senior  His own contained anger is misdirected at the likes of Professor Abner Ravenwood  his mentor at the University of Chicago  leading to a strained relationship with Marion Ravenwood  27  The teenage Indiana bases his own look on a figure from the prologue of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  after being given his hat  32 Marcus Brody acts as Indiana s positive role model at the college  32  Indiana s own insecurities are made worse by the absence of his mother  33  In Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom  the character becomes the father in a temporary family unit with Willie Scott and Short Round to survive  Indiana is rescued from the evil of Kali by Short Round s dedication  Indiana also saves many children from slavery  33  Because of Indiana s strained relationship with his father  who was absent much of Indiana s youth searching for the Holy Grail  the character does not pursue the more spiritual aspects of the cultures he studies  Indiana uses his knowledge of Shiva to ultimately defeat Mola Ram  33  In Raiders  however  he is wise enough to close his eyes in the presence of God in the Ark of the Covenant  By contrast  his rival Rene Belloq dies horribly for having the audacity to try to communicate directly with God  27  In Crusade s prologue  Indiana s intentions are revealed as prosocial  as he believes artifacts  belong in a museum   In the film s climax  Indiana undergoes  literal  tests of faith to retrieve the Grail and save his father s life  He also remembers Jesus as a historical figure   a humble carpenter   rather than an exalted figure when he recognizes the simple nature and tarnished appearance of the real Grail amongst a large assortment of much more ornately decorated ones  Henry Senior rescues his son from falling to his death when reaching for the fallen Grail  telling him to  let it go   overcoming his mercenary nature  32 The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles explains how Indiana becomes solitary and less idealistic after fighting in World War I  34  In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull  Jones is older and wiser  whereas his sidekicks Mutt and Mac are youthfully arrogant and greedy  respectively  35  Born in 1899  Indiana Jones is part of the Lost Generation and fits the Nomad archetype of Strauss Howe generational theory  He s a risk taking loner and survivalist  but  at the same time  can be a great leader and was a commanding officer during World War II   edit  Origins and inspirations Indiana Jones is modeled after the strong jawed heroes of the matin e serials and pulp magazines that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg enjoyed in their childhoods  such as the Republic Pictures serials  and the Doc Savage series   Sir H  Rider Haggard s safari guide big game hunter Allan Quatermain of King Solomon s Mines  who dates back to 1885  is a notable template for Jones  36  The two friends first discussed the project in Hawaii around the time of the release of the first Star Wars film  37  Spielberg told Lucas how he wanted his next project to be something fun  like perhaps a James Bond film  According to sources  Lucas responded to the effect that he had something  even better   37  or that he  got that beat   38  Two of the possible bases for  Indiana  Jones are Professor Challenger  created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in 1912 for his novel  The Lost World  who was in turn based on his Doyle physiology professor  Sir William Rutherford  an adventuring academic  albeit a zoologist anthropologist  or Charlton Heston s character of Harry Steele in 1954 Secret of the Incas  citation needed  The character was originally named  Indiana Smith   perhaps in a nod to the 1966 Western film Nevada Smith   after an Alaskan Malamute Lucas owned in the 1970s   Indiana    however  Spielberg disliked the name  Smith   and Lucas casually suggested  Jones  as an alternative based on the archaeologist Vendyl Jones  37  Costume designer Deborah Nadoolman Landis said the inspiration for Indiana s outfit was Charlton Heston s Harry Steele in Secret of the Incas   We did watch this film together as a crew several times  and I always thought it strange that the filmmakers did not credit it later as the inspiration for the series   39  Upon requests by Spielberg and Lucas  the costume designer gave the character a distinctive silhouette through the styling of the hat  after examining many hats  the designers chose a tall crowned  wide brimmed fedora  As a documentary of Raiders pointed out  the hat served a practical purpose  Following the lead of the old  B  movies that inspired the Indiana Jones series  the fedora hid the actor s face sufficiently to allow doubles to perform the more dangerous stunts seamlessly  Examples in Raiders include the wider angle shot of Indy and Marion crashing a statue through a wall  and Indy sliding under a fast moving vehicle from front to back  Thus it was necessary for the hat to stay in place much of the time  The hat became so iconic that the filmmakers could only come up with very good reasons or jokes to remove it  If it ever fell off during a take  filming would have to stop to put it back on  In jest  Ford put a stapler against his head to stop his from falling off when a documentary crew visited during shooting of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  This created the urban legend that Ford stapled the hat to his head  40  Although other hats were also used throughout the movies  the general style and profile remained the same  Elements of the outfit include  The fedora was supplied by Herbert Johnson Hatters in England for the first three films  It was referred to as  The Australian Model  by costume designer Deborah Landis and was fitted with a Petersham bow  41  The fedora for Crystal Skull was made by Steve Delk and Marc Kitter of the Adventurebilt Hat Company of Columbus  Mississippi  The leather jacket  a hybrid of the  Type 440  and the A 2 jacket  was made by Leather Concessionaires  now known as Wested Leather Co   for Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  For Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom  jackets were made in house at Bermans  amp  Nathans in London based on a stunt jacket they provided for Raiders of the Lost Ark  Tony Nowak made the jacket for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull  The bag was a modified Mark VII British gas mask bag  usually worn under the jacket with the exception of Crystal Skull where the bag was worn over the jacket  The whip was a 8 to 10 foot  2 4 to 3 0 m  bullwhip crafted by David Morgan for the first three films  The whips for Crystal Skull were crafted by a variety of people  including Terry Jacka  Joe Strain and Morgan  different lengths and styles were likely used in specific stunts   The pistol was usually a World War I era revolver  including the Webley Government  Last Crusade and Crystal Skull   or a  45 ACP Smith  amp  Wesson Hand Ejector 2nd model revolver  Raiders   He has also used an M1917 revolver  Temple of Doom   a Nagant M1895  Young Indiana Jones   and a 9 mm Browning Hi Power  Raiders   42  The weapon is carried in a military pattern flap holster  The shoes were made by Alden  A stock style  model 405  that had been a favorite of Ford s before the movies  they are still sold today  though in a redder  brick  shade of brown than seen in the movies  and are popularly known as  Indy Boots   43  The fedora and leather jacket from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade are on display at the Smithsonian s American History Museum in Washington  D C  44  The collection of props and clothing from the films has become a thriving hobby for some aficionados of the franchise  45  Jones  whip was the third most popular film weapon  as shown by a 2008 poll held by 20th Century Fox  which surveyed approximately two thousand film fans  46   edit  Casting Originally  Spielberg suggested Harrison Ford  Lucas resisted the idea  since he had already cast the actor in American Graffiti  Star Wars  and The Empire Strikes Back  and did not want Ford to become known as his  Bobby De Niro   in reference to the fact that fellow director Martin Scorsese regularly cast Robert De Niro in his films   37  During an intensive casting process  Lucas and Spielberg auditioned many actors  and finally cast then little known actor Tom Selleck as Indiana Jones  Shortly afterward pre production began in earnest on Raiders of the Lost Ark  37  However  CBS refused to release Selleck from his contractual commitment to Magnum  P I   which was gradually gaining momentum in the ratings   forcing him to turn down the role  37  One of CBS s concerns was that shooting for Magnum P I  conflicted with shooting for Raiders  both of which were to begin about the same time  However  Selleck was to say later in an interview that shooting for Magnum P I  was delayed and did not actually begin until shooting for Raiders had concluded  After Spielberg suggested Ford again  Lucas gave in  and Ford was cast in the role less than three weeks before filming began  37   edit  Models Many people are said to be the real life inspiration of the Indiana Jones character although none of the following have been confirmed as inspirations by Lucas or Spielberg  There are some suggestions  listed here in alphabetical order by last name  Beloit College professor and paleontologist Roy Chapman Andrews  47  Italian archaeologist and circus strongman Giovanni Battista Belzoni  1778 1823   48  Yale University professor  historian  and explorer Hiram Bingham III  who rediscovered and excavated the lost city of Machu Picchu  49  and chronicled his find in the bestselling book The Lost City of the Incas in 1948  50  University of Chicago archaeologist Robert Braidwood  51  University of Chicago archaeologist James Henry Breasted  52  The British archaeologist Percy Fawcett  who spent much of his life exploring the jungles of northern Brazil  and who was last seen in 1925 returning to the Amazon Basin to look for the Lost City Of Z  A fictionalized version of Fawcett appears to Jones in the book Indiana Jones And The Seven Veils  7  British archaeologist and soldier T  E  Lawrence  53  The Northwestern University anthropologist  professor and adventurer William Montgomery McGovern  54  Frederick Albert Mitchell Hedges  55  German archaeologist Otto Rahn  56  Lucas has said on various occasions that Sean Connery s portrayal of British secret agent James Bond was one of the primary inspirations for Jones  a reason Connery was chosen for the role of Indiana s father in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  57  58   edit  Influence This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   November 2011  Though some archaeologists criticize Indy s methods as befitting a  looter  rather more than a careful worker of precious sites  many have adopted the popular figure as something of a standard bearer for their profession  59  The industry magazine Archaeology  believing that Jones  as one editor said  was  a horrible archaeologist but a great diplomat for archaeology   59  named eight past and current archaeologists who they felt  embodied  Jones   spirit  as recipients of the  Indy Spirit Awards  in 2008  60  That same year Ford himself was elected to the Board of Directors of the Archaeological Institute of America  Commenting that  understanding the past can only help us in dealing with the present and the future   Ford was praised by the association s president for his character s  significant role in stimulating the public s interest in archaeological exploration   61  While himself a homage to various prior adventurers  aspects of Indiana Jones also directly influenced some subsequent characterizations  Lara Croft  the female archaeologist of the Tomb Raider series  was originally designed as a man  but was changed to a woman  partly because the developers felt that the original design was too similar to Indiana Jones  62 Paramount Pictures  which distributed the Indiana Jones film series  would later make two films based on the Tomb Raider games  Prince of Persia producer Ben Mattes explained that their  inspiration was anything Harrison Ford has ever done  Indiana Jones  Han Solo   63  The video game series Uncharted is also very heavily influenced and inspired by Indiana Jones  The main character  Nathan Drake  also shares many similarities with Indiana Jones himself  both visually and personality wise  The design team felt the sources shared themes of mystery and  what if scenarios  that romanticized adventure and aimed to include those in Uncharted  64  Jack West Jr  a character featured in 3 Matthew Reilly books   Seven Ancient Wonders  The Six Sacred Stones and The Five Greatest Warriors  is heavily influenced by Indiana Jones  Reilly is a big fan of George Lucas  Rick O Connell of The Mummy and its sequels  Ben Franklin Gates of the National Treasure film series  In the game World of Warcraft there is an NPC named Harrison Jones  a reference to Indiana Jones and Harrison Ford  who teaches Archaeology to the character  making them able to find ancient treasures around the world  Furthermore  the game area Uldum has numerous playable quests with Harrison Jones as the main character  which contain a number of lines and references from Raiders of the Lost Ark  The Tia Carrere television show Relic Hunter  Robert Langdon from such Dan Brown novels as Angels

template for the Indiana Jones character  King Solomon s Mines  1950   Quartermain finds himself unwillingly thrust into a worldwide search for the legendary mines of King Solomon  The look and feel of Indiana and his past adventures are quite apparent  Both Quartermain and Jones are confronted by angry villagers and a myriad of dangerous booby traps  Look to King Solomon s Mines for a good idea on the feel and tone Lucas and Spielberg are after with their latest Indiana Jones outing   Superheroflix com  Retrieved on 2012 01 14    a b c d e f g  Making Raiders of the Lost Ark   IndianaJones
