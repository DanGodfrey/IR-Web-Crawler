Cemeteries D Day assault map of the Normandy region and the north western coast of France  Utah Beach and Omaha Beach are separated by the Douve River  whose mouth is clear in the coastline notch  or  corner   of the map  Omaha Beach is the code name for one of the five sectors of the Allied invasion of German occupied France in the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944  during World War II  The beach is located on the coast of Normandy  France  facing the English Channel  and is 5 miles  8 km  long  from east of Sainte Honorine des Pertes to west of Vierville sur Mer on the right bank of the Douve River estuary  Landings here were necessary in order to link up the British landings to the east at Gold Beach with the American landing to the west at Utah Beach  thus providing a continuous lodgement on the Normandy coast of the Bay of the Seine  Taking Omaha was to be the responsibility of United States Army troops  with sea transport provided by the U S  Navy and elements of the Royal Navy  On D Day  the untested 29th Infantry Division  joined by nine companies of U S  Army Rangers redirected from Pointe du Hoc  were to assault the western half of the beach  The battle hardened 1st Infantry Division was given the eastern half  The initial assault waves  consisting of tanks  infantry  and combat engineer forces  were carefully planned to reduce the coastal defenses and allow the larger ships of the follow up waves to land  The primary objective at Omaha was to secure a beachhead of some five miles  eight kilometres  depth  between Port en Bessin and the Vire River  linking with the British landings at Gold Beach to the east  and reaching the area of Isigny to the west to link up with VII Corps landing at Utah Beach  Opposing the landings was the German 352nd Infantry Division  a large portion of whom were teenagers  though they were supplemented by veterans who had fought on the Eastern Front  The 352nd had never had any battalion or regimental training  Of the 12 020 men of the division  only 6 800 were experienced combat troops  detailed to defend a 53 km front  The Germans were largely deployed in strongpoints along the coast the German strategy was based on defeating any seaborne assault at the water line  Nevertheless  Allied calculations indicated that Omaha s defenses were three times as strong as those they had encountered during the Battle of Kwajalein and its defenders were four times as many  1  Very little went as planned during the landing at Omaha Beach  Difficulties in navigation caused the majority of landing craft to miss their targets throughout the day  The defenses were unexpectedly strong  and inflicted heavy casualties on landing US troops  Under heavy fire  the engineers struggled to clear the beach obstacles  later landings bunched up around the few channels that were cleared  Weakened by the casualties taken just in landing  the surviving assault troops could not clear the heavily defended exits off the beach  This caused further problems and consequent delays for later landings  Small penetrations were eventually achieved by groups of survivors making improvised assaults  scaling the bluffs between the most heavily defended points  By the end of the day  two small isolated footholds had been won  which were subsequently exploited against weaker defenses further inland  thus achieving the original D Day objectives over the following days  Contents 1 Omaha Beach 1 1 Terrain and defenses 1 2 Plan of attack 2 Initial assault 2 1 Tank landings 2 2 Infantry landings 2 3 Engineer landings 3 Second

at either end by rocky cliffs  the Omaha Beach crescent presented a gently sloping tidal area averaging 300 yards  275 m  between low and highwater marks  Above the tide line was a bank of shingle 8 feet  2 4 m  high and up to 15 yards  14 m  wide in some places  At the western end the shingle bank rested against a stone   further east becoming wood  sea wall which ranged from 4 12 feet  1 5 4 m  in height  For the remaining two thirds of the beach after the seawall ended the shingle lay against a low sand embankment  Behind the sand embankment and sea wall lay a level shelf of sand  narrow at either end and extending up to 200 yards  180 m  inland in the center  Steep escarpments or bluffs then rose 100 170 feet  30 50 m   dominating the whole beach and cut into by small wooded valleys or draws at five points along the beach  codenamed west to east D 1  D 3  E 1  E 3 and F 1  2  German Panzer IV turret mounted on bunker at Omaha Beach  June 1944 A German casemate at Omaha Beach Inner view of a German casemate at Omaha Beach The German defensive preparations and the lack of any defense in depth indicated that their plan was to stop the invasion at the beaches  3  Four lines of obstacles were constructed in the water  The first  a non contiguous line with a small gap in the middle of Dog White sector and a larger gap across the whole of Easy Red sector  was 270 yards  250 m  out from the highwater line and consisted of 200 Belgian Gates with mines lashed to the uprights  Some 32 yards  30 m  behind these was a continuous line of logs driven into the sand pointing seaward  every third one capped with an anti tank mine  This method was not as effective as the Germans would have wished  Another 32 yards  30 m  shoreward of this line was a continuous line of 450 ramps sloping towards the shore  also with mines attached and designed to force flat bottomed landing craft to ride up and either flip or detonate the mine  The final line of obstacles was a continuous line of hedgehogs 165 yards  150 m  from the shoreline  4  The area between the shingle bank and the bluffs was both wired and mined  and mines were also scattered on the bluff slopes  German barricades set up to prevent tanks advancing on the shores became useful to the allies  seeing that they provided cover from the hail of bullets  Coastal troop deployments  comprising five companies of infantry  were concentrated mostly at 15 strongpoints called Widerstandsnester   resistance nests    numbered WN 60 in the east to WN 74 near Vierville in the west  located primarily around the entrances to the draws and protected by minefields and wire  5  Positions within each strongpoint were interconnected by trenches and tunnels  As well as the basic weaponry of rifles and machine guns  a total of over 60 light artillery pieces were deployed at these strongpoints  The heaviest pieces were located in eight gun casemates and four open positions while the lighter guns were housed in 35 pillboxes  A further 18 anti tank guns completed the disposition of artillery targeting the beach  Areas between the strongpoints were lightly manned with occasional trenches  rifle pits  and a further 85 machine gun emplacements  6  7  No area of the beach was left uncovered  and the disposition of weapons meant that flanking fire could be brought to bear anywhere along the beach  Allied intelligence identified the coastal defenses as being manned by a reinforced battalion  800 1000 men  of the 716th Infantry Division  8  This was a static defensive division estimated to contain up to 50  of non Germanic troops  mostly Russian volunteers and German Volksdeutsche  The recently activated  but capable 352nd Infantry Division was identified as being located 20 miles  30 km  inland at Saint L  and was regarded as the most likely force to be committed to a counter attack  However  as part of Rommel s strategy to concentrate defenses at the water s edge the 352nd was ordered forward in March  9  taking over responsibility for the defense of the Normandy coast in which Omaha Beach was located  As part of this reorganization the 352nd also took under command the two battalions of the 726th Grenadier Regiment as well as the 439th Ost Battalion that had been attached to the 726th  10  Omaha Beach fell mostly within  Coast Defense Sector 2   stretching westwards from Colleville and allocated to the 916th Grenadier Regiment with the third battalion 726th Grenadier Regiment attached  Two companies of the 726th manned strongpoints in the Vierville area while two companies of the 916th occupied the St  Laurent area strongpoints in the center of Omaha  These positions were supported by the artillery of the first and fourth battalions of the 352nd Artillery Regiment  twelve 105 mm and four 150 mm howitzers respectively   The two remaining companies of the 916th formed a reserve at Formigny two miles  4 km  inland  East of Colleville   Coast Defense Sector 3  was the responsibility of the remainder of the 726th Grenadier Regiment  Two companies were deployed at the coast  one in the most easterly series of strongpoints  with artillery support provided by the third battalion of the 352nd Artillery Regiment  The area reserve  comprising the two battalions of the 915th Grenadier Regiment and known as  Kampfgruppe Meyer   was located south east of Bayeux outside of the immediate Omaha area  11  The failure to identify the reorganization of the defenses was a rare intelligence breakdown for the allies  Post action reports still documented the original estimate and assumed that the 352nd had been deployed to the coastal defenses by chance only a few days previously as part of an anti invasion exercise  11  12  The source of this inaccurate information came from German prisoners of war from the 352nd Infantry Division captured on D Day as reported by the 16th Infantry S 3 D Day Action Report  In fact  Allied intelligence had already become aware of the relocation of the 352nd Infantry Division on June 4  This information was passed on to V Infantry Corps and 1st Infantry Division HQ through 1st Army  however  at this late stage in the operations no plans were changed  13   edit  Plan of attack Official history map showing the V Corps objectives for D Day Omaha was divided into ten sectors  codenamed  from west to east   Able  Baker  Charlie  Dog Green  Dog White  Dog Red  Easy Green  Easy Red  Fox Green and Fox Red  The initial assault was to be made by two Regimental Combat Teams  RCT   supported by two tank battalions  with two battalions of Rangers also attached  The infantry regiments were organized into three battalions each of around 1 000 men  Each battalion was organized as three rifle companies each of up to 240 men  and a support company of up to 190 men  14  Infantry companies A through D belonged to the 1st battalion of a regiment  E through H to the 2nd  I through M to the 3rd  the letter  J  was not used   Individual companies will be referred to in this article by company and regiment  e g  Company A of the 116th RCT will be A 116   In addition  each battalion had a headquarters company of up to 180 men  The tank battalions consisted of three companies  A through C  each of 16 tanks  while the Ranger battalions were organized into six companies  A through F  of around 65 men per company  The 116th RCT of the 29th Infantry Division was to land two battalions in the western four sectors  to be followed 30 minutes later by the third battalion  Their landings were to be supported by the tanks of the 743rd Tank Battalion  two companies swimming ashore in amphibious DD tanks and the remaining company landing directly onto the beach from assault craft  To the left of the 116th RCT the 16th RCT of the 1st Infantry Division was also to land two battalions with the third following 30 minutes after  on Easy Red and Fox Green at the eastern end of Omaha  Their tank support was to be provided by the 741st Tank Battalion  again two companies swimming ashore and the third landed conventionally  Three companies of the 2nd Ranger Battalion were to take a fortified battery at Pointe du Hoc  three miles  5 km  to the west of Omaha  Meanwhile C company 2nd Rangers was to land on the right of the 116th RCT and take the positions at Pointe de la Perc e  The remaining companies of 2nd Rangers and the 5th Ranger Battalion were to follow up at Pointe du Hoc if that action proved to be successful  otherwise they were to follow the 116th into Dog Green and proceed to Pointe du Hoc overland  15  The landings were scheduled to start at 06 30   H Hour   on a flooding tide  preceded by a 40 minute naval and 30 minute aerial bombardment of the beach defenses  with the DD tanks arriving five minutes before H Hour  The infantry were organized into specially equipped assault sections  32 men strong  one section to a landing craft  with each section assigned specific objectives in reducing the beach defenses  Immediately behind the first landings the Special Engineer Task Force was to land with the mission of clearing and marking lanes through the beach obstacles  This would allow the larger ships of the follow up landings to get through safely at high tide  The landing of artillery support was scheduled to start at H 90 minutes while the main build up of vehicles was to start at H 180 minutes  At H 195 minutes two further Regimental Combat Teams  the 115th RCT of the 29th Infantry Division and the 18th RCT of the 1st Infantry Division were to land  with the 26th RCT of the 1st Infantry Division to be landed on the orders of the V Corps commander  16  The objective was for the beach defenses to be cleared by H 2 hours  whereupon the assault sections were to reorganize  continuing the battle in battalion formations  The draws were to be opened to allow traffic to exit the beach by H 3 hours  By the end of the day  the forces at Omaha were to have established a bridgehead five miles  8 km  deep  linked up with the British 50th Division landed at Gold Beach to the east  and be in position to move on Isigny the next day  linking up with the American VII Corps at Utah Beach to the west  17  The assault force expected to execute this plan totaled over 34 000 men and 3 300 vehicles  with naval support provided by two battleships  three cruisers  12 destroyers  and 105 other ships  These were provided predominantly by the US Navy  but also included British and Free French warships  18  The 16th RCT  swollen by 3 502 men and 295 vehicles attached only for the beach landing  numbered 9 828 troops  919 vehicles and 48 tanks  To move this force required 2 transport ships  6 Landing Ships  Tank  LSTs   53 LCTs  5 Landing Craft Infantry  Large   LCI  L s   81 LCVPs  18 LCAs  13 other landing craft  and about 64 DUKWs  19  Assault craft were crewed by the US Navy  US Coast Guard and the British Royal Navy  20   edit  Initial assault H Hour  A landing craft of the initial assault wave nears the smoke shrouded coast following a heavy naval bombardment  Official history map showing first assault wave landings Despite these preparations  very little went according to plan  Ten landing craft were swamped by the rough seas before they reached the beach and several others stayed afloat only because their passengers bailed water with their helmets  Seasickness was prevalent among the troops waiting offshore  On the 16th RCT front  the landing boats passed struggling men in life preservers and on rafts  survivors of the DD tanks which had sunk  21  Navigation of the assault craft was made difficult by the smoke and mist obscuring the landmarks they were to use in guiding themselves in  while a heavy current pushed them continually eastward  22  As the boats approached within a few hundred yards of the shore  they came under increasingly heavy fire from automatic weapons and artillery  The force discovered only then the ineffectiveness of the pre landing bombardment  Delayed by the weather and attempting to avoid the landing craft as they ran in  the bombers had laid their ordnance too far inland  having no real effect on the coastal defenses  23   edit  Tank landings Because sea conditions were too rough  the decision was made for the 116th RCT to carry the DD tanks of the 743rd Tank Battalion all the way to the beach  Coming in opposite the heavily defended Vierville draw  Company B of the 743rd Tank Battalion lost all but one of its officers and half its DD tanks  However  the other two companies landed to the left of B 743 without initial loss  On the 16th RCT front  the two DD tanks that had survived the swim ashore were joined by three others that were landed directly onto the beach because of their LCT s damaged ramp  The remaining tank company managed to land 14 of its 16 tanks  although three of these were quickly knocked out   24  25   edit  Infantry landings I was the first one out  The seventh man was the next one to get across the beach without being hit  All the ones in between were hit  Two were killed  three were injured  That s how lucky you had to be  Captain Richard Merrill  2nd Ranger Battalion  26  Dog Green sector Dog White sector Dog Red sector Easy Green sector Easy Red sector Fox Green sector Of the nine companies landing in the first wave  only Company A of the 116th RCT at Dog Green and the Rangers to their right landed where intended  E 116  aiming for Easy Green  ended up scattered across the two sectors of the 16th RCT beach  27  G 116  aiming for Dog White  opened up a 1 000 yard  900 m  gap between themselves and A 116 to their right when they landed at Easy Green instead  I 16 drifted so far east it did not land for another hour and a half  28  As infantry disembarked from the landing craft  they often found themselves on sandbars 50 to 100 yards  45 to 90 m  out  To reach the beach they had to wade through water sometimes neck deep  and they still had 200 yards  180 m  or more to go when they did reach shore  Those that made it to the shingle did so at a walking pace because they were so heavily laden  Most sections had to brave the full weight of fire from small arms  mortars  artillery  and interlocking fields of heavy machine gun fire  29  Where the naval bombardment had set grass fires burning  as it had at Dog Red opposite the Les Moulins strongpoint  the smoke obscured the landing troops and prevented effective fire from being laid down by the defenders  27  Some sections of G 116 and F 116 were able to reach the shingle bank relatively unscathed  though the latter became disorganized after the loss of their officers  G 116 was able to retain some cohesion  but this was soon lost as they made their way westwards under fire along the shingle in an attempt to reach their assigned objectives  30  The scattering of the boats was most evident on the 16th RCT front  where parts of E 16  F 16 and E 116 had intermingled  making it difficult for sections to come together to improvise company assaults that might have reversed the situation caused by the mis landings  Those scattered sections of E 116 landing at Easy Red were able to escape heavy casualties  although  having encountered a deep runnel after being landed on a sandbank  they were forced to discard most of their weapons to make the swim ashore  31  Casualties were heaviest among the troops landing at either end of Omaha  In the east at Fox Green and the adjacent stretch of Easy Red  scattered elements of three companies were reduced to half strength by the time they gained the relative safety of the shingle  many of them having crawled the 300 yards  270 m  of beach just ahead of the incoming tide  Within 15 minutes of landing at Dog Green on the western end of the beach  A 116 had been cut to pieces  the leaders among the 120 or so casualties  30  32  33  34  the survivors reduced to seeking cover at the water s edge or behind obstacles  The smaller Ranger company to their right had fared a little better  having made the shelter of the bluffs  but were also down to half strength  L 16 eventually landed  30 minutes late  to the left of Fox Green  taking casualties as the boats ran in and more as they crossed the 200 yards  180 m  of beach  The terrain at the very eastern end of Omaha  however  gave them enough protection to allow the 125 survivors to organize and begin an assault of the bluffs  They were the only company in the first wave able to operate as a unit  35  All the other companies were  at best  disorganized  mostly leaderless and pinned down behind the shingle with no hope of carrying out their assault missions  At worst  they had ceased to exist as fighting units  Nearly all had landed at least a few hundred yards off target  and in an intricately planned operation where each section on each boat had been assigned a specific task  this was enough to throw the whole plan off   edit  Engineer landings Like the infantry  the engineers had been pushed off their targets  and only five of the 16 teams arrived at their assigned locations  Three teams came in where there were no infantry or armor to cover them  Working under heavy fire  the engineers set about their task of clearing gaps through the beach obstacles work made more difficult by loss of equipment  and by infantry passing through or taking cover behind the obstacles they were trying to blow  They also suffered heavy casualties as enemy fire set off the explosives they were working with  Eight men of one team were dragging their pre loaded rubber boat off the LCM when artillery hit  only one survived the resulting detonation of their supplies  Another team had just finished laying their explosives when the area was struck by mortar fire  The premature explosion of the charges killed or wounded 19 engineers  as well as some nearby infantry  Nevertheless  the engineers succeeded in clearing six gaps  one each at Dog White and Easy Green on the 116th RCT front  the other four at Easy Red on the 16th RCT front  However  they had suffered casualties of over 40   36   edit  Second assault wave Official history map showing the second assault wave landings  An officer observes Omaha Beach as his landing craft approaches the Norman coast  With the initial targets unaccomplished  the second and larger wave of assault landings brought in reinforcements  support weapons and headquarter elements at 07 00 only to face nearly the same difficulties as had the first  The only advantage enjoyed by second wave was that it was larger  and so the defenders  fire was less concentrated  The survivors of the first wave were unable to provide effective covering fire  and in places the fresh landing troops suffered casualty rates as high as those of the first wave  Failure to clear paths through the beach obstacles also added to the difficulties of the second wave  In addition  the incoming tide was beginning to hide the remaining obstacles  causing high attrition among the landing craft before they had reached the shore  As in the initial landings  difficult navigation caused disruptive mislandings  scattering the infantry and separating vital headquarters elements from their units  37  On the 116th RCT front  the remainder of the 1st battalion  B 116  C 116 and D 116  were due to land in support of A 116 at Dog Green  Three boats  including their headquarters and beach master groups  landed too far west  under the cliffs  Their exact casualties in getting across the beach are unknown  but the one third to one half that made it spent the rest of the day pinned down by snipers  Dog Green remaining a lethal sector  Not all sections of the badly scattered B 116 landed there  but those that did were quickly forced to join those survivors of A 116 fighting for survival at the water s edge  38  Two companies of 2nd Rangers  coming in later on the edge of Dog Green  did manage to reach the seawall  but at the cost of half their strength  39  To the left of Dog Green sat the Dog White sector  between the Vierville and Les Moulins strongpoints  defending draws D 1 and D 3   and here was a different story  As a result of earlier mis landings  and now because of their own mis landing  the troops of C 116 found themselves alone at Dog White  with only a handful of tanks from the first wave in sight  The smoke from the grass fires covering their advance up the beach  they gained the seawall with few casualties  and were in better shape than any unit on the 116th RCT front so far  40  Although the 1st battalion was effectively disarmed of its heavy weapons when D 116 suffered a disastrous landing  the build up at Dog White continued  C 116 was joined by the 5th Ranger battalion almost in its entirety  The Ranger commander  recognizing the situation at Dog Green on the run in  ordered the assault craft to divert into Dog White  Like the C 116  the smoke covered their advance  although the 2nd Rangers were caught out on the right flank of the Ranger s landing  This was the sector where the 116th RCT regimental command group  including the 29th Division assistant commander Brigadier General Norman Cota  was able to land relatively unscathed  39  Further east  the strongpoint defenses were effective  On the Dog Red   Easy Green boundary  the defenses around the Les Moulins strongpoint took a heavy toll on the remaining 2nd battalion  H 116 and headquarters elements struggling ashore there  The survivors joined the remnants of F 116 behind the shingle  and here the battalion commander was able to organize 50 men for an improvised advance across the shingle  However  a further advance up the bluffs just east of Les Moulins was too weak to have any effect and was forced back down  41  To their left  mainly between the draws on the Easy Green   Easy Red boundary  the 116th RCT support battalion landed without too much loss  although they did become scattered  and were too disorganized to play any immediate part in an assault on the bluffs  42  On the 16th RCT front  at the eastern end of Easy Red  was another area between strongpoints  This allowed G 16 and the support battalion to escape complete destruction in their advance up the beach  Nevertheless  most of G 16 s 63 casualties for the day came before they had reached the shingle  The other 2nd battalion company landed in the second wave  H 16 came in a few hundred yards to the left  opposite the E 3 draw  and suffered for it   they were put out of action for several hours  43  On the eastern most beach  Fox Green  elements of five different companies had become entangled  and the situation was little improved by the equally disorganized landings of the second wave  Two more companies of the 3rd battalion joined the melee  and  having drifted east in the first wave  I 16 finally made their traumatic landing on Fox Green  at 08 00  Two of their six boats were swamped on their detour to the east  and as they came in under fire  three of the four remaining boats were damaged by artillery or mines  and the fourth was hung up on an obstacle  A captain from this company found himself senior officer  and in charge of the badly out of shape 3rd battalion  44   edit  American situation Assault troops of the 3rd battalion 16th RCT  from the first two waves  shelter under the chalk cliffs  which identify this as an area of Fox Red sector   Wounded soldiers from a sunken landing craft are brought ashore  Along with the infantry landing in the second wave  supporting arms began to arrive  meeting the same chaos and destruction as had the rifle companies  Combat engineers  tasked with clearing the exits and marking beaches  landed off target and without their equipment  Many half tracks  jeeps and trucks floundered in deep water  those that made it ashore soon became jammed up on the narrowing beach  making easy targets for the German defenders  Most of the radios were lost  making the task of organizing the scattered and dispirited troops even more difficult  and those command groups that did make the shore found their effectiveness limited to their immediate vicinity  Except for a few surviving tanks and a heavy weapons squad here or there  the assault troops had only their personal weapons  which  having been dragged through surf and sand  invariably needed cleaning before they could be used  45  The survivors at the shingle  many facing combat for the first time  found themselves relatively well protected from small arms fire  but still exposed to artillery and mortars  In front of them lay heavily mined flats exposed to active fire from the bluffs above  Morale naturally became a problem  46  Many groups were leaderless and witnesses to the fate of neighboring troops and landings coming in around them  Wounded men on the beach were drowning in the incoming tide and incoming landing craft were being pounded and set ablaze   edit  German situation As late as 13 35 the German 352nd division was reporting that the assault had been hurled back into the sea  47  From their vantage point at Pointe de la Perc e  overlooking the whole beach from the western end  the German perception was that the assault had been stopped at the beach  An officer there noted that troops were seeking cover behind obstacles  and counted ten tanks burning  48  However  as early as 07 35  the third battalion 726th Grenadier Regiment  defending Draw F 1 on Fox Green beach  was reporting that 100 200 American troops had penetrated the front  with troops inside the wire at WN 62 and WN 61 attacking the Germans from the rear  49  Casualties among the defenders were mounting  While the 916th regiment  defending the center of the 352nd zone  was reporting that the landings had been frustrated  it was also requesting reinforcement  The request could not be met  because the situation elsewhere in Normandy was becoming more urgent for the defenders  The reserve regiment  the 915th of the 352nd division  which had earlier been ordered against the American airborne landings to the west of Omaha  was diverted to the Gold Beach zone east of Omaha  the defenses there having crumbled  50   edit  Breakthrough  Are you going to lay there and get killed  or get up and do something about it   Unidentified lieutenant  Easy Red sector  46  The key geographical features that had influenced the landings also influenced the next phase of the battle  the draws  the natural exits off the beaches  were the main targets in the initial assault plan  However  the strongly concentrated defenses around these draws meant that the troops landing near them quickly wound up in no shape to carry a further assault  Only in the areas between the draws  at the bluffs  were units able to land in greater strength  Defenses were also weaker away from the draws  thus  most advances were made there  51  The other key aspect of the next few hours was leadership  The original plan was in tatters  with so many units mis landed  disorganized and scattered  Most commanders had fallen or were absent  and there were few ways to communicate  other than shouted commands  In places  small groups of men  sometimes scratched together from different companies  in some cases from different divisions  were     inspired  encouraged or bullied     46  out of the relative safety of the shingle  starting the grueling task of reducing the defenses atop the bluffs   edit  Assaulting the bluffs Survivors of C company 2nd Rangers in the first wave landed on Dog Green around 06 45  by 07 30  they had scaled the cliffs near Dog White and the Vierville draw  They were joined later by a mis landed section from B 116  and this group spent the better part of the day tying up and eventually taking WN 73  which defended draw D 1 at Vierville  52  53  At 07 50  C 116 led the charge off of Dog White  between WN 68 and WN 70  by forcing gaps in the wire with a Bangalore torpedo and wire cutters  20 minutes later  the 5th Rangers joined the advance  and blew more openings  The command party established themselves at the top of the bluff  and elements of G 116 and H 116 joined them  having earlier moved laterally along the beach  and now the narrow front had widened to the east  Before 09 00  small parties from F 116 and B 116 reached the crests just east of Dog White  53  54  The right flank of this penetration was covered by the survivors of the 2nd Rangers  A and B companies  who had independently fought their way to the top between 08 00 and 08 30  They took WN 70  already heavily damaged by naval shells   and joined the 5th Rangers for the move inland  By 09 00 more than 600 American troops  in groups ranging from company sized to just a few men  had reached the top of the bluff opposite Dog White and were advancing inland  55  56  The 3rd battalion 116th RCT forced its way across the flats and up the bluff between WN 66  which defended the D 3 draw at Les Moulins   and WN 65  defending the E 1 draw   They advanced in small groups  supported by the heavy weapons of M 116  who were held at the base of the bluff  Progress was slowed by mines on the slopes of the bluff  but elements of all three rifle companies  as well as a stray section of G 116  had gained the top by 09 00  causing the defenders at WN 62 to mistakenly report that both WN 65 and WN 66 had been taken  57  58  Between 07 30 and 08 30 elements of G 16  E 16  and E 116 came together and climbed the bluffs at Easy Red  between WN 64  defending the E 1 draw  and WN 62  the E 3 draw   At 09 05  German observers reported that WN 61 was lost  and that only one machine gun was still firing from WN 62  150 men  mostly from G 16  having reached the top hampered more by minefields than by enemy fire  continued south to attack the WN 63 command post on the edge of Colleville  Meanwhile E 16  led by Second Lieutenant John M  Spalding  turned westward along the top of the bluffs  engaging in a two hour battle for WN 64  His small group of just three men had effectively neutralized this point by mid morning  taking 21 prisoners just in time to prevent them from attacking freshly landing troops  59  On the beach below  the 16th RCT commander  Colonel George Taylor had landed at 08 15  With the words  Two kinds of people are staying on this beach  the dead and those who are going to die   now let s get the hell out of here   60  he organized groups of men regardless of their unit  putting them under the command of the nearest non commissioned officer and sending them through the area opened up by G 16  By 09 30  the regimental command post was set up just below the bluff crest  and the 1st and 2nd battalions of the 16th RCT were being sent inland as they reached the crest  61  On Fox Green  at the eastern end of Omaha  four sections of L 16 had survived their landing intact and were now leading elements of I 16  K 16 and E 116 up the slopes  With supporting fire from the heavy weapons of M 16  tanks and destroyers  this force eliminated WN 60  which defended the draw at F 1  by 09 00  the 3rd battalion 16th RCT was moving inland  53  62   edit  Naval support USS Frankford The only artillery support for the troops making these tentative advances was from the navy  Finding targets difficult to spot  and in fear of hitting their own troops  the big guns of the battleships and cruisers concentrated fire on the flanks of the beaches  The destroyers  however  were able to get in closer  and from 08 00 began engaging their own targets  At 09 50  two minutes after the McCook destroyed a 75 mm gun position in WN 74  the destroyers were ordered to get as close in as possible  Some approached within 1 000 yards  900 m  several times  scraping bottom and risking running aground  49  An engineer who had landed in the first wave at Fox Red  watching the Frankford steaming in towards shore  thought she had been badly hit and was being beached  Instead  she turned parallel to the beach and cruised westwards  guns blazing at targets of opportunity  Thinking she would turn back out to sea  the engineer soon saw that she had instead begun backing up  guns still firing  At one point  gunners aboard the Frankford saw an immobilized tank at the water s edge  still firing  Watching the fall of its shot  they followed up with a salvo of their own  In this manner  the tank acted as the ship s fire control party for several minutes  63   edit  Pre invasion naval bombardment General Bradley reviewing Allied troops in England training for D Day  promised the soldiers that the Germans on the beach would be blasted with naval gunfire prior to the landing and that   You men should consider yourself lucky  You are going to have ringside seats for the greatest show on earth  naval gunfire    64  Rear Admiral John L  Hall   Commander Task Force 124  the  Omaha  Beach Assault Force   strongly disapproved of the amount of air and naval bombardment used  Hall was recorded saying  It s a crime to send me on the biggest amphibious attack in history with such inadequate naval gunfire support  65  Later analysis of naval support during the pre landing phase concluded that the navy had provided inadequate bombardment  given the size and extent of the planned assault  66  Kenneth P  Lord  a U S  Army planner for the D Day invasion  says that  upon hearing the naval gunfire support plan for Omaha Beach  which limited support to one battleship  two cruisers and six destroyers  he and other planners were very upset especially in light of the tremendous naval gunfire support given to landings in the Pacific  67  Historian Adrian R  Lewis postulates that American casualties would have been greatly reduced if a longer barrage had been implemented  68   edit  German defenses inland While the coastal defenses had not turned back the invasion at the beach  they had broken up and weakened the assault formations struggling through them  The German emphasis on this Main Line of Resistance  MLR  meant that defenses further inland were significantly weaker  and based on small pockets of prepared positions smaller than company sized in strength  This tactic was enough to disrupt American advances inland  making it difficult even to reach the assembly areas  let alone achieve their D Day objectives  69  As an example of the effectiveness of German defenses despite weakness in numbers  the 5th Ranger battalion was halted in its advance inland by a single machine gun position hidden in a hedgerow  One platoon attempted to outflank the position  only to run into another machine gun position to the left of the first  A second platoon dispatched to take this new position ran into a third  and attempts to deal with this met with fire from a fourth position  The success of the MLR in blocking the movement of heavy weapons off the beach meant that  after four hours  the Rangers were forced to give up on attempts to move them any further inland  70   edit  Beachhead Omaha Beach on the afternoon of D Day American reinforcements landing on Omaha Beach  Despite penetrations inland  the key beach objectives had not been achieved  The draws necessary for the movement of vehicles off the beach had not been opened  and the strongpoints defending these were still putting up a spirited resistance  The failure to significantly clear the beach obstacles tended to force subsequent landings to concentrate in the Easy Green and Easy Red sectors  71  Where vehicles were landing  they found only a narrow strip of beach with no shelter from enemy fire and around 08 30 the decision was taken to suspend all such landings  The closure of the beach to vehicles resulted in a jam of landing craft out to sea  The DUKW s had a particularly hard time of it in the rough conditions  The experiences of the 111th Field Artillery battalion of the 116th RCT are indicative of the general situation these craft faced  Of the 13 DUKW s being used to carry this unit in  five were swamped soon after disembarking from the LCT  four were lost as they circled in the rendezvous area waiting to land and one capsized as they turned for the beach  Two were destroyed by enemy fire as they approached the beach and the lone survivor managed to offload its howitzer to a passing craft before it also succumbed to the sea  This one gun eventually landed in the afternoon  72  Aerial view of Omaha Beach 6 June 1944 showing the landing of the 18th and 115th infantry regiments  The official record of Omaha reports that     the tanks were leading a hard life      According to the commander of the 2nd battalion 116th RCT the tanks     saved the day  They shot the hell out of the Germans  and got the hell shot out of them   73  As the morning progressed the beach defenses were gradually being reduced  often by tanks  Scattered along the length of the beach  trapped between the sea and the impassable shingle embankment and with no operating radios amongst the commanders  tanks had to be controlled individually  This was perilous work  The commanding officer of the 111th Field Artillery  who had landed ahead of his unit  was killed as he tried to direct the fire of one tank  The command group of the 741st tank battalion lost three out their group of five in their efforts  Additionally  the commander of the 743rd tank battalion became a casualty as he approached one of his tanks with orders  When naval gunfire was brought to bear against the strong points defending the E 3 draw  a decision was made to try to force this exit with tanks  Colonel Taylor ordered all available tanks into action against this point at 11 00  Only three were able to reach the rallying point  and two were knocked out as they attempted to go up the draw  forcing the remaining tank to back off  Reinforcement regiments were due to land by battalion  beginning with the 18th RCT at 09 30 on Easy Red  The first battalion to land  2 18  arrived at the E 1 draw 30 minutes late after a difficult passage through the congestion off shore  Casualties were light  though  Despite the existence of a narrow channel through the beach obstacles  the ramps and mines there accounted for the loss 22 LCVPs  2 LCI L s and 4 LCTs  Supported by tank and subsequent naval fire  the newly arrived troops took the surrender at 11 30 of the last strong point defending the entrance to the E 1 draw  Although a usable exit was finally opened  congestion prevented an early exploitation inland  The three battalions of the 115th RCT  scheduled to land from 10 30 on Dog Red and Easy Green  came in together and on top of the 18th RCT landings at Easy Red  The confusion prevented the remaining two battalions of the 18th RCT from landing until 13 00  and delayed the move off the beach of all but 2 18  which had exited the beach further east before noon  until 14 00  Even then  this movement was hampered by mines and enemy positions still in action further up the draw  74  Aerial view of Omaha showing the draws  left to right  Vierville  D 1   Les Moulins  D 3   St  Laurent  E 1   Colleville  E 3  and  Number 5 Draw   F 1   By early afternoon  the strong point guarding the D 1 draw at Vierville was silenced by the navy  But without enough force on the ground to mop up the remaining defenders  the exit could not be opened  Traffic was eventually able to use this route by nightfall  and the surviving tanks of the 743rd tank battalion spent the night near Vierville  75  The advance of the 18th RCT cleared away the last remnants of the force defending the E 1 draw  When engineers cut a road up the western side of this draw  it became the main route inland off the beaches  With the congestion on the beaches thus relieved  they were re opened for the landing of vehicles by 14 00  Further congestion on this route  caused by continued resistance just inland at St  Laurent  was bypassed with a new route  and at 17 00  the surviving tanks of the 741st tank battalion were ordered inland via the E 1 draw  76  The F 1 draw  initially considered too steep for use  was also eventually opened when engineers laid down a new road  In the absence of any real progress opening the D 3 and E 3 draws  landing schedules were revised to take advantage of this route  and a company of tanks from the 745th tank battalion were able to reach the high ground by 20 00  77  Approaches to the exits were also cleared  with minefields lifted and holes blown in the embankment to permit the passage of vehicles  As the tide receded  engineers were also able to resume their work of clearing the beach obstacles  and by the end of the evening  13 gaps were opened and marked  78   edit  German reactions Observing the build up of shipping off the beach  and in an attempt to contain what were regarded as minor penetrations at Omaha  a battalion was detached from the 915th regiment being deployed against the British to the east  Along with an anti tank company  this force was attached to the 916th regiment and committed to a counter attack in the Colleville area in the early afternoon  It was stopped by  firm American resistance  and reported heavy losses  79  The strategic situation in Normandy precluded the reinforcement of the weakened 352nd division  The main threat was perceived by the Germans to be the British beachheads to the east of Omaha  and these received the most attention from the German mobile reserves in the immediate area of Normandy  80  Preparations were made to bring up units stationed for the defense of Brittany  southwest of Normandy  but these would not arrive quickly and would be subject to losses inflicted in transit by overwhelming Allied air superiority  The last reserve of the 352nd division  an engineer battalion  was attached to the 916th regiment in the evening  It was deployed to defend against the expected attempt to breakout of the Colleville St  Laurent beachhead established on the 16th RCT front  At midnight General Dietrich Kraiss  commander of the 352nd division  reporting the total loss of men and equipment in the coastal positions  advised that he had sufficient forces to contain the Americans on D 1 but that he would need reinforcements thereafter  only to be told that there were no more reserves available  81   edit  End of the day Official history map showing extent of advances made by evening  An American casualty of the morning s battle  Following the penetrations inland  confused hard fought individual actions pushed the foothold out barely a mile and a half  2 5 km  deep in the Colleville area to the east  less than that west of St  Laurent  and an isolated penetration in the Vierville area  Pockets of enemy resistance still fought on behind the American front line  and the whole beachhead remained under artillery fire  At 21 00 the landing of the 26th RCT completed the planned landing of infantry  but losses in equipment were high  including 26 artillery pieces  over 50 tanks  about 50 landing craft and 10 larger vessels  82  Of the 2 400 tons of supplies scheduled to be landed on D Day  only 100 tons actually landed  83  Casualties for V Corps were estimated at 3 000 killed  wounded and missing  The heaviest casualties were taken by the infantry  tanks and engineers in the first landings  The 16th and 116th RCT s lost about 1 000 men each  82  Only five tanks of the 741st tank battalion were ready for action the next day  84  The German 352nd division suffered 1 200 killed  wounded and missing  about 20  of its strength  81  Its deployment at the beach caused such problems that Lieutenant General Omar Bradley  commander of the U S  First Army  at one stage considered evacuating Omaha  85  while Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery considered the possibility of diverting V Corps forces through Gold Beach  86   edit  Aftermath Official history map showing advances made by the 29th Infantry Division in the days immediately after D Day Official history map showing advances made by the 1st Infantry Division in the days immediately after D Day Supplies and reinforcements being landed at Omaha Beach in the days following the landings The foothold gained on D Day at Omaha Beach  itself two isolated pockets  was the most tenuous across all the D Day beaches  With the original objective yet to be achieved  the priority for the allies was to link up all the Normandy beachheads  86  During the course of June 7  while still under random shellfire  the beach was prepared as a supply area  Surplus cargo ships were deliberately sunk to form an artificial breakwater and  while still less than planned  1 429 tons of stores were landed that day  87  With the beach assault phase completed the RCTs reorganized into infantry regiments and battalions and over the course of the next two days achieved the original D Day objectives  On the 1st divisional front the 18th Infantry Regiment blocked an attempt by two companies from the 916th and 726th Grenadiers to break out of WN 63 and Colleville  both of which were subsequently taken by the 16th Infantry Regiment which also moved on Port en Bessin  The main advance was made by the 18th Infantry Regiment  with the 3rd battalion of the 26th Infantry Regiment attached  south and south eastwards  The heaviest opposition was encountered at Formigny where troops of the 2nd battalion 915th Grenadiers had reinforced the headquarters troops of 2nd battalion 916th Grenadiers  Attempts by 3 26 and B 18 with support from the tanks of B 745 were held off and the town did not fall until the morning of June 8  The threat of an armored counter attack kept the 18th Infantry Regiment on the defensive for the rest of June 8  The 26th Infantry Regiment s three battalions  having been attached to the 16th  18th and 115th Regiments the previous day  spent June 8 reassembling before pushing eastwards  forcing the 1st battalion of the German 726th Grenadiers to spend the night extricating itself from the pocket thus forming between Bayeux and Port en Bessin  By the morning of June 9 the 1st Division had established contact with the British XXX Corps  thus linking Omaha with Gold Beach  88  On the 29th divisional front two battalions of the 116th Infantry Regiment cleared the last defenders from the bluffs while the remaining 116th battalion joined the Rangers in their move west along the coast  This force relieved the 2nd Ranger companies who were holding Pointe du Hoc on June 8 and subsequently forced the German 914th Grenadiers and the 439th Ost Battalion to withdraw from the Grandcamp area which lay further to the west  Early on June 7 WN 69 defending St  Laurent was abandoned and the 115th Infantry Regiment was therefore able to push inland to the south west  reaching the Formigny area on the June 7 and the original D Day phase line the following day  The third regiment of 29th Division  the 175th  started landing on June 7  By the morning of June 9 this regiment had taken Isigny and on the evening of the following day forward patrols established contact with the 101st Airborne Division  thus linking Omaha with Utah Beach  89  In the meantime  the original defender at Omaha  the 352nd Division  was being steadily reduced  By the morning of June 9 the division was reported as having been     reduced to  small groups      while the 726th Grenadier Regiment had     practically disappeared   90  By June 11 the effectiveness of the 352nd was regarded as  very slight   91  and by June 14 the German corps command was reporting the 352nd as completely used up and needing to be removed from the line  92  Once the beachhead had been secured Omaha Beach became the location of one of the two Mulberry harbors  prefabricated artificial harbors towed in pieces across the English Channel and assembled just off shore  Construction of  Mulberry A  at Omaha began the day after D Day with the scuttling of ships to form a breakwater  By D 10 the harbor became operational when the first pier was completed  LST 342 docking and unloading 78 vehicles in 38 minutes  Three days later the worst storm to hit Normandy in 40 years began to blow  raging for three days and not abating until the night of June 22  The harbor was so completely wrecked that the decision was taken not to repair it  supplies being subsequently landed directly on the beach until fixed port facilities were captured  93  In the few days that the harbor was operational 11 000 troops  2 000 vehicles and 9 000 tons of equipment and supplies were brought ashore  94  Over the 100 days following D Day more than 1 000 000 tons of supplies  100 000 vehicles and 600 000 men were landed  and 93 000 casualties were evacuated  via Omaha Beach  95  Today at Omaha jagged remains of the harbor can be seen at low tide  The shingle bank is no longer there  cleared by engineers in the days following D Day to facilitate the landing of supplies  The beachfront is more built up and the beach road extended  villages have grown and merged  but the geography of the beach remains as it was and the remains of the coastal defenses can still be visited  96  At the top of the bluff overlooking Omaha near Colleville is the American cemetery  Omaha Beach landscape 67 years after landing  Harbor remains and  Les Braves  monument can be seen on the sand beach top edge   edit  See also World War II portal Military of the United States portal Heinrich Severloh also known as  The Beast of Omaha Beach   edit  Footnotes
