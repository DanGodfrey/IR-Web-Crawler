colonial era and the slave era  Legally sanctioned racism imposed a heavy burden on Native Americans  African Americans  Asian Americans  and Latin Americans  European Americans  particularly Anglo Americans  were privileged by law in matters of literacy  immigration  voting rights  citizenship  land acquisition  and criminal procedure over periods of time extending from the 17th century to the 1960s  Many non Protestant European immigrant groups  particularly American Jews  Irish Americans  Italian Americans  as well as other immigrants from elsewhere  suffered xenophobic exclusion and other forms of discrimination in American society  Major racially structured institutions included slavery  Indian Wars  Native American reservations  segregation  residential schools  for Native Americans   and internment camps  1  Formal racial discrimination was largely banned in the mid 20th century  and came to be perceived as socially unacceptable and or morally repugnant as well  yet racial politics remain a major phenomenon  Historical racism continues to be reflected in socio economic inequality  2 Racial stratification continues to occur in employment  housing  education  lending  and government  Many people in the U S  continue to have some prejudices against other races  3  4  5  In the view of the US Human Rights Network  a network of scores of US civil rights and human rights organizations   Discrimination permeates all aspects of life in the United States  and extends to all communities of color   6  Discrimination against African Americans  Latin Americans

of the Muscogee  Creek  Nation in Oklahoma around 1877  Notice the members with European and African ancestry  The Creek were originally from the Alabama region  Native Americans  who have lived on the North American continent for at least 20 000 years  10  had an enormously complex impact on American history and racial relations  During the colonial and independent periods  a long series of conflicts were waged  with the primary objective of obtaining resources of Native Americans  Through wars  massacres  forced displacement  such as in the Trail of Tears   and the imposition of treaties  land was taken and numerous hardships imposed  In 1540  the first racial strife was with Spaniard Hernando de Soto s expedition who enslaved and murdered in many New World communities  In the early 18th century  the English had enslaved nearly 800 Choctaws  11  After the creation of the United States  the idea of Indian removal gained momentum  However  some Native Americans chose or were allowed to remain and avoided removal whereafter they were subjected to racist institutions in their ancestral homeland  The Choctaws in Mississippi described their situation in 1849   we have had our habitations torn down and burned  our fences destroyed  cattle turned into our fields and we ourselves have been scourged  manacled  fettered and otherwise personally abused  until by such treatment some of our best men have died   12  Joseph B  Cobb  who moved to Mississippi from Georgia  described Choctaws as having  no nobility or virtue at all   and in some respect he found blacks  especially native Africans  more interesting and admirable  the red man s superior in every way  The Choctaw and Chickasaw  the tribes he knew best  were beneath contempt  that is  even worse than black slaves  13  Ideological expansionist justification  Manifest Destiny  included stereotyped perceptions of all Native Americans as  merciless Indian savages   as described in the United States Declaration of Independence  despite successful American efforts at civilization as proven with the Cherokee  Chickasaw  Creek  and Choctaw  An egregious attempt occurred with the California gold rush  the first two years of which saw the deaths of thousands of Native Americans  Under Mexican rule in California  Indians were subjected to de facto enslavement under a system of peonage by the white elite  While in 1850  California formally entered the Union as a free state  with respect to the issue of slavery  the practice of Indian indentured servitude was not outlawed by the California Legislature until 1863  14  Military and civil resistance by Native Americans has been a constant feature of American history  So too have a variety of debates around issues of sovereignty  the upholding of treaty provisions  and the civil rights of Native Americans under U S  law   edit  Discrimination  marginalization Once their territories were incorporated into the United States  surviving Native Americans were denied equality before the law and often treated as wards of the state  15  See also  Native American reservations Many Native Americans were relegated to reservations constituting just 4  of U S  territory and the treaties signed with them violated  Tens of thousands of American Indians and Alaska Natives were forced to attend a residential school system which sought to reeducate them in white settler American values  culture and economy  to  kill the Indian  save the man   16  17  Further dispossession of various kinds continues into the present  although these current dispossessions  especially in terms of land  rarely make major news headlines in the country  e g   the Lenape people s recent fiscal troubles and subsequent land grab by the State of New Jersey   and sometimes even fail to make it to headlines in the localities in which they occur  Through concessions for industries such as oil  mining and timber and through division of land from the Allotment Act forward  these concessions have raised problems of consent  exploitation of low royalty rates  environmental injustice  and gross mismanagement of funds held in trust  resulting in the loss of  10 40 billion  18  The Worldwatch Institute notes that 317 reservations are threatened by environmental hazards  while Western Shoshone land has been subjected to more than 1 000 nuclear explosions  19   edit  Assimilation efforts into American society Benjamin Hawkins  seen here on his plantation  teaches Creek Native Americans how to use European technology  Painted in 1805  George Washington and Henry Knox believed that Native Americans were equals but that their society was inferior  citation needed  The government appointed agents  like Benjamin Hawkins  to live among the Native Americans and to teach them  through example and instruction  how to live like whites  20  Washington formulated a policy to encourage the  civilizing  process  21  Washington had a six point plan for civilization which included  1  impartial justice toward Native Americans 2  regulated buying of Native American lands 3  promotion of commerce 4  promotion of experiments to civilize or improve Native American society 5  presidential authority to give presents 6  punishing those who violated Native American rights  22  The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 granted U S  citizenship to all Native Americans  Prior to the passage of the act  nearly two thirds of Native Americans were already U S  citizens  23  The earliest recorded date of Native Americans becoming U S  citizens was in 1831 when the Mississippi Choctaw became citizens after the United States Legislature ratified the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek  Under article XIV of that treaty  any Choctaw who elected not to move to Native American Territory could become an American citizen when he registered and if he stayed on designated lands for five years after treaty ratification  Citizenship could also be obtained by  1  Treaty Provision  as with the Mississippi Choctaw  2  Allotment under the Act of February 8  1887 3  Issuance of Patent in Fee Simple 4  Adopting Habits of Civilized Life 5  Minor Children 6  Citizenship by Birth 7  Becoming Soldiers and Sailors in the U S  Armed Forces 8  Marriage 9  Special Act of Congress    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled  That all noncitizen Native Americans born within the territorial limits of the United States be  and they are hereby  declared to be citizens of the United States  Provided  That the granting of such citizenship shall not in any manner impair or otherwise affect the right of any Native American to tribal or other property      Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 While formal equality has been legally granted  American Indians  Alaska Natives  Native Hawaiians  and Pacific Islanders remain among the most economically disadvantaged groups in the country  and according to National mental health studies  American Indians as a group tend to suffer from high levels of alcoholism  depression and suicide  24   edit  Racism against African Americans Main article  African American history Perhaps the most prominent and notable form of American racism  other than imperialism against Native Americans  began with the institution of slavery  during which Africans were enslaved and treated as property  Prior to the institution of slavery  early African and non white immigrants to the Colonies had been regarded with equal status  serving as sharecroppers alongside whites  After the institution of slavery the status of Africans was stigmatized  and this stigma was the basis for the more virulent anti African racism that persisted until the present  25   edit  Slavery and emancipation This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   November 2009  In colonial America  before slavery became completely based on racial lines  thousands of African slaves served European colonists  alongside other Europeans serving a term of indentured servitude  26  In some cases for African slaves  a term of service meant freedom and a land grant afterward  but these were rarely awarded  and few former slaves became landowners this way  citation needed  In a precursor to the American Revolution  Nathaniel Bacon led a revolt in 1676 against the Governor of Virginia and the system of exploitation he represented  exploitation of poorer colonists by the increasingly wealthy landowners where poorer people  regardless of skin color  fought side by side  However  Bacon died  probably of dysentery  hundreds of participants in the revolt were lured to disarm by a promised amnesty  and the revolt lost steam  27  Slaves were primarily used for agricultural labor  notably in the production of cotton and tobacco  Black slavery in the Northeast was common until the early 19th century  when many Northeastern states abolished slavery  Slaves were used as a labor force in agricultural production  shipyards  docks  and as domestic servants  In both regions  only the wealthiest Americans owned slaves  citation needed  In contrast  poor whites recognized that slavery devalued their own labor  The social rift along color lines soon became ingrained in every aspect of colonial American culture  citation needed  Approximately one Southern family in four held slaves prior to war  According to the 1860 U S  census  there were about 385 000 slaveowners out of approximately 1 5 million white families  28  In the early part of the 19th century  a variety of organizations were established advocating the movement of black people from the United States to locations where they would enjoy greater freedom  some endorsed colonization  while others advocated emigration  During the 1820s and 1830s the American Colonization Society  A C S   was the primary vehicle for proposals to return black Americans to greater freedom and equality in Africa  29  and in 1821 the A C S  established the colony of Liberia  assisting thousands of former African American slaves and free black people  with legislated limits  to move there from the United States  The colonization effort resulted from a mixture of motives with its founder Henry Clay stating   unconquerable prejudice resulting from their color  they never could amalgamate with the free whites of this country  It was desirable  therefore  as it respected them  and the residue of the population of the country  to drain them off   30  Although the Constitution had banned the importation of new African slaves in 1808  and in 1820 slave trade was equated with piracy  punishable by death  31  the practice of chattel slavery still existed for the next half century  All slaves in only the areas of the Confederate States of America that were not under direct control of the United States government were declared free by the Emancipation Proclamation  which was issued on January 1  1863 by President Abraham Lincoln  32  It should be noted that the Emancipation Proclamation did not apply to areas loyal to  or controlled by  the Union  thus the document only freed slaves where the Union still had not regained the legitimacy to do so  Slavery was not actually abolished in the United States until the passage of the 13th Amendment which was declared ratified on December 6  1865  33  About 4 million black slaves were freed in 1865  Ninety five percent of blacks lived in the South  comprising one third of the population there as opposed to one percent of the population of the North  Consequently  fears of eventual emancipation were much greater in the South than in the North  34  Based on 1860 census figures  8  of all white males aged 13 to 43 died in the civil war  including 6  in the North and an extraordinary 18  in the South  35  Despite this  post emancipation America was not free from racism  discriminatory practices continued in the United States with the existence of Jim Crow laws  educational disparities and widespread criminal acts against people of color  citation needed   edit  Nadir of American race relations Main articles  Nadir of American race relations and Mass racial violence in the United States The mob style lynching of Will James  Cairo  Illinois  1909  The new century saw a hardening of institutionalized racism and legal discrimination against citizens of African descent in the United States  Although technically able to vote  poll taxes  acts of terror  often perpetuated by groups such as the Ku Klux Klan  founded in the Reconstruction South   and discriminatory laws such as grandfather clauses kept black Americans disenfranchised particularly in the South but also nationwide following the Hayes election at the end of the Reconstruction era in 1877  In response to de jure racism  protest and lobbyist groups emerged  most notably  the NAACP  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  in 1909  This time period is sometimes referred to as the nadir of American race relations because racism in the United States was worse during this time than at any period before or since  Segregation  racial discrimination  and expressions of white supremacy all increased  So did anti black violence  including lynchings and race riots  In addition  racism which had been viewed primarily as a problem in the Southern states  burst onto the national consciousness following the Great Migration  the relocation of millions of African Americans from their roots in the Southern states to the industrial centers of the North after World War I  particularly in cities such as Boston  Chicago  and New York  Harlem   In northern cities  racial tensions exploded  most violently in Chicago  and lynchings  mob directed hangings  usually racially motivated increased dramatically in the 1920s  As a member of the Princeton chapter of the NAACP  Albert Einstein corresponded with W  E  B  Du Bois  and in 1946 Einstein called racism America s  worst disease   36  37   edit  African Americans in recent decades While substantial gains were made in the succeeding decades through middle class advancement and public employment  black poverty and lack of education 38  deepened in the context of de industrialization  39  Prejudice  discrimination  and institutional racism  see below  continued to affect African Americans  From 1981 to 1997  the United States Department of Agriculture discriminated against tens of thousands of African American farmers  denying loans provided to white farmers in similar circumstances  The discrimination was the subject of the Pigford v  Glickman lawsuit brought by members of the National Black Farmers Association  which resulted in two settlement agreements of  1 25 billion in 1999 and of  1 15 billion in 2009  40  Many cite the 2008 United States presidential election as a step forward in race relations  White Americans played a role in electing Barack Obama  the country s first black president  41  In fact  Obama received a greater percentage of the white vote  43    42  than did the previous Democratic candidate  John Kerry  41    43  Racial divisions persisted throughout the election  wide margins of Black voters gave Obama an edge during the presidential primary  where 8 out of 10 African Americans voted for him in the primaries  and an MSNBC poll showed that race was a key factor in whether a candidate was perceived as being ready for office  In South Carolina  for instance  Whites were far likelier to name Clinton than Obama as being most qualified to be commander in chief  likeliest to unite the country and most apt to capture the White House in November  Blacks named Obama over Clinton by even stronger margins   two  and three to one   in all three areas    44   edit  Discrimination and racism against Asian Americans A Sinophobic cartoon called  Yellow terror  appearing in the United States in 1899 See also  Sinophobia  Chinese American history  and Anti Chinese sentiment in the United States  Anti Japanese sentiment in the United States  Yellow Peril  and Turban Tide and Hindoo Invasion In the Pacific States  racism was primarily directed against the resident Asian immigrants  Several immigration laws discriminated against the Asians  and at different points the ethnic Chinese or other groups were banned from entering the United States  45  Nonwhites were prohibited from testifying against whites  a prohibition extended to the Chinese by People v  Hall  46  The Chinese were often subject to harder labor on the First Transcontinental Railroad and often performed the more dangerous tasks such as using dynamite to make pathways through the mountains  47  The San Francisco Vigilance Movement  although ostensibly a response to crime and corruption  also systematically victimized Irish immigrants  and later this was transformed into mob violence against Chinese immigrants  citation needed   Anti Chinese sentiment was also rife in early Los Angeles  culminating in a notorious 1871 riot in which a mob attacked Chinese residents  48  In the ensuing inquests and trials  all the perpetrators either were acquitted  or received only light punishments for lesser offenses  citation needed  because the testimony of Chinese witnesses was either completely inadmissible  or else considered less credible than that of others  Legal discrimination of Asian minorities was furthered with the passages of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882  which banned the entrance of virtually all ethnic Chinese immigrants into the United States until 1943  During World War II  the United States created internment camps for Japanese American citizens in fear that they would be used as spies for the Japanese  49  Currently implemented immigration laws are still largely plagued with national origin based quotas that is unfavorable to Asian countries due to large populations and historically low U S  immigration rates  3   edit  Discrimination against Latin Americans Americans of Latin American ancestry  often categorized as  Hispanic   come from a wide variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds  Latinos are not all distinguishable as a racial minority  After the Mexican American War  1846 1848   the U S  annexed much of the current Southwestern region from Mexico  Mexicans residing in that territory found themselves subject to discrimination  It is estimated that at least 597 Mexicans were lynched between 1848 and 1928  this is a conservative estimate due to lack of records in many reported lynchings   Mexicans were lynched at a rate of 27 4 per 100 000 of population between 1880 and 1930  This statistic is second only to that of the African American community during that period  which suffered an average of 37 1 per 100 000 population  50  Between 1848 to 1879  Mexicans were lynched at an unprecedented rate of 473 per 100 000 of population  51  During The Great Depression  the U S  government sponsored a Mexican Repatriation program which was intended to encourage Mexican immigrants to voluntarily return to Mexico  however  many were forcibly removed against their will  In total  up to one million persons of Mexican ancestry were deported  approximately 60 percent of those individuals were actually U S  citizens  52  The Zoot Suit Riots were vivid incidents of racial violence against Latinos  e g  Mexican Americans  in Los Angeles in 1943  Naval servicemen stationed in a Latino neighborhood conflicted with youth in the dense neighborhood  Frequent confrontations between small groups and individuals had intensified into several days of non stop rioting  Large mobs of servicemen would enter civilian quarters looking to attack Mexican American youths  some of whom were wearing zoot suits  a distinctive exaggerated fashion popular among that group  53  The disturbances continued unchecked  and even assisted  by the local police for several days before base commanders declared downtown Los Angeles and Mexican American neighborhoods off limits to servicemen  54  Many public institutions  businesses  and homeowners associations had official policies to exclude Mexican Americans  School children of Mexican American descent were subject to racial segregation in the public school system  In many counties  Mexican Americans were excluded from serving as jurors in court cases  especially in those that involved a Mexican American defendant  In many areas across the Southwest  they lived in separate residential areas  due to laws and real estate company policies  55  56  57  58  During the 1960s  Mexican American youth rallied behind civil rights causes and launched the Chicano Movement   edit  Antisemitism Main article  Antisemitism in the United States Antisemitism has also played a role in America  During the late 19th and early 20th centuries  hundreds of thousands of Ashkenazi Jews were escaping the pogroms of Russia and Eastern Europe  They boarded boats from ports on the Baltic Sea and in Northern Germany  and largely arrived at Ellis Island  New York  59  It is thought by Leo Rosten  in his book   The Joys of Yiddish   that as soon as they left the boat  they were subject to racism from the port immigration authorities  The derogatory term  kike  was adopted when referring to Jews  because they often could not write so they may have signed their immigration papers with circles   or kikel in Yiddish   60  From the 1910s  the Southern Jewish communities were attacked by the Ku Klux Klan  who objected to Jewish immigration  and often used  The Jewish Banker  in their propaganda  In 1915  Texas born  New York Jew Leo Frank was lynched by the newly re formed Klan  after being convicted of rape and sentenced to death  his punishment was commuted to life imprisonment   61  The events in Nazi Germany also attracted attention from America  Jewish lobbying for intervention in Europe drew opposition from the isolationists  amongst whom was Father Charles Coughlin  a well known radio priest  who was known to be critical of Jews  believing that they were leading America into the war  62  He preached in weekly  overtly anti Semitic sermons and  from 1936  began publication of a newspaper  Social Justice  in which he printed anti Semitic accusations such as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion  62  A number of Jewish organizations  Christian organizations  Muslim organizations  and academics consider the Nation of Islam to be anti Semitic  Specifically  they claim that the Nation of Islam has engaged in revisionist and antisemitic interpretations of the Holocaust and exaggerates the role of Jews in the African slave trade  63  The Jewish Anti Defamation League  ADL  alleges that NOI Health Minister  Abdul Alim Muhammad  has accused Jewish doctors of injecting blacks with the AIDS virus  64  an allegation that Dr  Abdul Alim Muhammad has denied   edit  Racism against Middle Easterners and South Asians See also  Anti Arabism and Islamophobia An Assyrian church vandalized in Detroit  2007   Assyrians  although not Arabs and mostly Christians  often face backlash in the US for their Middle Eastern background  65  People of Middle East and South Asian descent historically occupied an ambiguous racial status in the United States  Middle East  and South Asian immigrants were among those who sued in the late 19th and early 20th century to determine whether they were  white  immigrants as required by naturalization law  By 1923  courts had vindicated a  common knowledge  standard  concluding that  scientific evidence   including the notion of a  Caucasian race  including Arabs and many South Asians  was incoherent  Legal scholar John Tehranian argues that in reality this was a  performance based  standard  relating to religious practices  education  intermarriage and a community s role in the United States  66  Recent studies have found that while official parameters encompass Arabs as part of the White American racial category  many Arab Americans from places other than the Levant feel they are not white and are not perceived as white by American society   67  Racism against Arab Americans 68  and racialized Islamophobia against Muslims has risen concomitantly with tensions between the American government and the Islamic world  69  Following the September 11  2001 attacks in the United States  discrimination and racialized violence has markedly increased against Arab Americans and many other religious and cultural groups  70  Scholars  including Sunaina Maira and Evelyn Alsultany  argue that in the post September 11 climate  Muslim Americans have been racialized within American society  although the markers of this racialization are cultural  political  and religious rather than phenotypic  71  72  Middle Easterners in particular were demonized which led to hatred towards Arabs and Iranians living in the United States and elsewhere in the western world  73  74  There have been attacks against Arabs not only on the basis of their religion  Islam   but also on the basis of their ethnicity  numerous Christian Arabs have been attacked based on their appearances  75  In addition  non Arab peoples  Iranians  Assyrians  Yezidis  Kurds  who are mistaken for Arabs because of perceived  similarities in appearance  have been collateral victims of anti Arabism  Iranian people  who constitute a different ethnicity than Arabs   as well as South Asians of different ethnic religious backgrounds  Hindus  Muslims and Sikhs  have been stereotyped as  Arabs   The case of Balbir Singh Sodhi  a Sikh who was murdered at a Phoenix gas station by a white supremacist for  looking like an Arab terrorist   because of the turban that is a requirement of Sikhism   as well as that of Hindus being attacked for  being Muslims  have achieved prominence and criticism following the September 11 attacks  76  77  Those of Middle Eastern descent who are in the United States military face racism from fellow soldiers  Army Spc Zachari Klawonn endured numerous instances of racism during his enlistment at Fort Hood  Texas  During his basic training he was made to put cloth around his head and play the role a terrorist  His fellow soldiers had to take him down to the ground and draw guns on him  He was also called things such as  raghead    sand monkey   and  Zachari bin Laden    78   edit  War on Drugs and Racism The  War on Drugs  is a term coined by President Nixon  was a law enforcement effort by US Presidents starting from Nixon to oppose the sale  distribution and usage of illegal drugs  This term as well as the effects of this war has become controversial for the way it has hurt Black people  racial minorities and poor people in the USA  A big part of this effort has involved in the arresting of Americans  over 13 million  mostly of color  Every one in 9 black families have a close relative in prison over aggressive arrests done by US law enforcement  79  Even though usage of illegal drugs are roughly the same along racial lines  the Drug Policy Alliance Network shows that blacks constitute 13 percent of drug users  but are 38 percent of people arrested for drug offenses  and 59 percent of those convicted  80  The Human Rights Watch supported this claim as well  stating that of blacks convicted of drug crimes 71  are incarcerated  compared with 63  of convicted whites  81  US laws have a much higher penalty for possession and distribution of crack coccaine  a frequently used drug among African Americans and this affects the Black community as well   edit  Racism against Iranians See also  Anti Iranian sentiment A man holding a sign that reads  deport all Iranians  and  get the hell out of my country  during a protest of the Iran hostage crisis in Washington  D C  in 1979  The November 1979 Iranian hostage crisis of the U S  embassy in Tehran precipitated a wave of anti Iranian sentiment in the United States  directed both against the new Islamic regime and Iranian nationals and immigrants  Even though such sentiments gradually declined after the release of the hostages at the start of 1981  they sometimes flare up  In response  some Iranian immigrants to the U S  have distanced themselves from their nationality and instead identify primarily on the basis of their ethnic or religious affiliations  82  Ann Coulter called Iranians  ragheads   83 Brent Scowcroft called the Iranian people  rug merchants   84  Since the 1980s and especially since the 1990s Hollywood s depiction of Iranians has gradually shown signs of vilifying Iranians  85  Hollywood network productions such as 24  86 John Doe  On Wings of Eagles  1986   87 Escape From Iran  The Canadian Caper  1981   88  and JAG almost regularly host Persian speaking villains in their storylines  On May 9  1997  CBS aired an episode of JAG in which several Hamas terrorists take a Washington hospital under siege  According to the film  they spoke in fluent  Persian   not  Arabic   citation needed   edit  Anti European immigrant racism Main Article  Anti Irish racism on Irish Americans Various non Jewish European American immigrant groups have been subject to discrimination either on the basis of their immigrant status  known as  Nativism   or on the basis of their ethnicities  country of origin   Philadelphia Nativist Riots  New York Times  1854 ad  reading  No Irish need apply   In the 19th century  this was particularly true of anti Irish prejudice  which was partly anti Catholic sentiment  partly anti Irish as an ethnicity  This was especially true for Irish Catholics who immigrated to the U S  in the mid 19th century  the large number of Irish  both Catholic and Protestant  who settled in America in the 18th century had largely  but not entirely  escaped such discimination and eventually blended into the American white population  The 20th century saw racism against immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe  notably Italian Americans and Polish Americans   partly from anti Catholic sentiment  as against Irish Americans   and partly from Nordicism  which considered Southern Europeans and Eastern Europeans inferior   see Nordicism in the USA    Biological laws tell us that certain divergent people will not mix or blend  The Nordics propagate themselves successfully  With other races  the outcome shows deterioration on both sides     Future US president Calvin Coolidge  1921  89  Nordicism lead to the reduction in Southern European and Eastern European immigrants in the National Origins Formula of the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and the Immigration Act of 1924  whose goal was to maintain the status quo distribution of ethnicity by limiting immigration in proportion to existing populations  This reduced the inflow from the average prior to 1921 of 176 983 from Northern and Western Europe  and 685 531 for other countries  principally Southern and Eastern Europe  to a 1924 level of 140 999 for Northern and Western Europe  and 21 847 for other countries  principally Southern and Eastern Europe  from a 1 3 9 ratio to a 6 4 1 ratio   There was also racism against German Americans and Italian Americans due to these being enemy countries in World War I  Germany  and World War II  Germany and Italy   This resulted in a sharp decrease in German American ethnic identity and a sharp decrease in the use of German in the United States following WWI  which had hitherto been significant  and to German American internment and Italian American internment during WWII  see also World War I anti German sentiment  Specific European American ethnicities significantly diminished as a political issue in the 1930s  being replaced by a bi racialism of Black White  as described and predicted by Lothrop Stoddard  due to numerous causes  The National Origins Formula significantly reduced inflows of non Nordic ethnicities  the Great Migration  of African Americans out of the South  displaced anti White immigrant racism with anti Black racism  and the Great Depression brought economic concerns to the fore  Anti Catholic sentiment remained evident in the presidential campaign of John F  Kennedy  who nevertheless went on to become the US s first Catholic  and indeed non Protestant  president  In the 1960s and 1970s  ethnic jokes most notably Jew Jokes and Polish Jokes were popular  but are considered offensive to people of Irish  Italian  Polish  Jewish and other White ethnic descent  citation needed  After the fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse of the the Soviet Union in the late 1980s early 1990s many immigrants came to the United States from Eastern Europe  A new type of racism which is based on the former Cold War stereotypes began to target white people from the former Soviet states  There are many jokes refer to a communist past  corruption  alcohol consumption  prostitution  and unemployment  Some people began to use words like Eurotrash  mafia  cracker  commie  Borat  and Russki when refer to Russians  Ukranians  Belarusians  or Balcans  Serbs  Albanians and others  During the Olympic Games in Vancouver NBC s commenter Mike Milbury used the term

as racial quotas or gender quotas for collegiate admission  have been criticized as a form of  reverse discrimination   90  Affirmative action is sometimes called  reverse racism  by its opponents  91

as separate races  often identifying as having  American ethnicity    have distinct heritages and experience discrimination and low socio economic status as an ethnicity  The status of poor rural whites has often been compared to that of blacks  being also seen as suffering from slavery  because unable to compete with the free labor of slaves   Such descriptions date to the 19th century  as is Uncle Tom s Cabin  and poor rural whites continue to lag on numerous socio economic indicators  health  income  and the like    see social and economic stratification in Appalachia  Other white subgroups who are sometimes subject of offensive humor  jokes  and stereotypes are Mormons  due to their religion  and French Canadians  because their mother language is French    edit  Anti White crimes Main article  Hate crimes against white people One series of unprovoked crimes that specifically targeted White Americans is the Zebra murders that occurred in San Francisco between 1973 and 1974  The Zebra murders were carried out by a group known as Death Angels  a radical splinter group of the Nation of Islam  that intended to kill whites to spread terror and earn favor and status within their sect  Another series of crimes that specifically targeted whites is the 2002 Beltway sniper attacks which planned to kill six whites a day for 30 days  93  and resulted in 10 deaths and 3 critical injuries  One of the snipers Lee Boyd Malvo testified that John Allen Muhammad was driven by hatred of America because of its  slavery  hypocrisy and foreign policy  and his belief that  the white man is the devil   According to the Southern Poverty Law Center  national anti white hate groups that are currently active include Nation of Islam and New Black Panther Party  According to FBI statistics from 1995 2002  whites are the second most targeted group for racially motivated hate crime in New York City  94   edit  History by region In the popular imagination  racism is particularly associated with the American South  with its legacy of slavery and Jim Crow  However  all regions of the United States have exhibited racism in various forms and at various times  For example  the Great Migration of African Americans  1910 1930  from the South to the Northeast  Midwest  and West  led to increased Black White contact  racism  and segregation in the destinations   edit  West Coast racism The Pacific and Western states were often portrayed to those on the East Coast as more liberal in terms of race relations in the 1960s and 1970s  but California legally allowed racial segregation of public facilities until the 1950s and other forms of racism were felt there as well  Over the winter spanning 1929 and 1930  anti Filipino racism exploded in the Central Coast area surrounding Watsonville over labor tensions and general xenophobia  Filipino farm workers were terrorized for  taking jobs from whites   and for mixing with white women  in California  and many states  Filipinos were barred from marrying White Americans  a group which included Hispanic Americans   Violence was done against Filipinos  some resulting in deaths  and a Filipino establishment was even dynamited  A race war broke out in the Bay Area  with roving gangs of whites pulling Filipinos from their homes and dwellings  until the violence subsided  As a result of the riots  California s attitude changed towards importing cheaper Asian labor  ironically moving towards utilizing cheaper Mexican labor instead  95  See also  History of Oregon Racial Discrimination A variety of laws were enacted to prevent African American migration to the Pacific Northwest  While slavery was criminalized in the Oregon Territory in 1844  a so called  lash law  subjected blacks found guilty of violating the law to whippings no less than 20 and no more than 39 strokes of the lash every six months  until he or she shall quit the territory   An exclusion law  barring African Americans from entering the territory was passed in 1847  repealed in 1854  and added to the new Oregon state constitution in 1857  While African Americans have been present at some level since 1805  the demographic reverberations of these laws remain today  96   edit  Racism as a factor in U S  foreign policy The earliest decades of expansionist United States foreign policy making was often accompanied by racialist ideological justifications  While pursuing a series of expansionist wars  see  Racism against Native Americans  above   American leaders embraced an ideology of white racial supremacy  George Washington predicted at the end of the U S  Revolutionary War   The gradual extension of our settlements will as certainly cause the savage  as the wolf  to retire  both being beasts of prey  tho  they differ in shape   97  The successful slave revolution in Haiti alarmed the United States leadership  and the country refused diplomatic recognition for decades  The United States conquest of Florida and the Seminole Wars were fought in part to confront the danger of  mingled hordes of lawless Indians and negroes   in the words of President John Quincy Adams  98  Early 20th century President Theodore Roosevelt declared   The most ultimately righteous of all wars is a war with savages  and openly spoke of cementing the rule of  dominant world races   98  In line with the concepts of the  Manifest Destiny  of white Anglo Americans to conquer lands inhabited by  inferior  races of Native Americans and Mexicans  and the  White Man s Burden  of Europeans  obligation to introduce civilization to the  primitive  people of Africa  Asia and the Pacific  American foreign policy in the early 20th century had racial overtones of a  superior  race destined to rule the world  Critics such as Gore Vidal and Noam Chomsky have suggested that racism has played a significant role in U S  foreign policy in the Middle East and its treatment of the Arabs  Various critics have suggested that racism along with strategic and financial interests motivated the Bush Administration to attack Iraq even though the Baathist regime of Saddam Hussein did not possess weapons of mass destruction nor had any ties to Al Qaida  99  100  101  On the other hand  some scholars believe that the United States has softened racial restrictions based on foreign policy concerns  For example  Congress eliminated racial bars on Asian immigration during World War II and the Vietnam War to recognize American allies  102  When the Supreme Court decided Brown v  Board of Education  the government argued that the Supreme Court should rule against racial segregation to counter Communist propaganda and improve America s image overseas  103   edit  Conflicts between racial and ethnic minorities  edit  Argument against minority minority racism Minority racism is sometimes considered controversial because of theories of power in society  Some theories of racism insist that racism can only exist in the context of social power to impose it upon others  104   edit  African and Mexican American gang violence There has been ongoing violence between African American and Mexican American gangs  particularly in Southern California  105  106  107  108  There have been reports of racially motivated attacks against Mexican Americans who have moved into neighborhoods occupied mostly by African Americans  and vice versa  109  110  According to gang experts and law enforcement agents  a longstanding race war between the Mexican Mafia and the Black Guerilla Family  a rival African American prison gang  has generated such intense racial hatred among Mexican Mafia leaders  or shot callers  that they have issued a  green light  on all blacks  This amounts to a standing authorization for Latino gang members to prove their mettle by terrorizing or even murdering any blacks sighted in a neighborhood claimed by a gang loyal to the Mexican Mafia  dead link  111  There have been several significant riots in California prisons where Mexican American inmates and African Americans have targeted each other particularly  based on racial reasons  112  113   edit  New Immigrant Africans and African Americans The rapid growth in African immigrants has come into conflict with American blacks  Interaction and cooperation between African immigrants and black Americans are  ironically

period of conflict  ethnic and racial groups can band together in solidarity  For example  the competing Irish American and Italian American groups once held animosity against each other in the early 20th century  would later merge and also with Polish Americans  German Americans and French Canadians in the U S  because of the commonality as  ethnics  and Roman Catholics in a primarily Protestant Anglo America by the 1940s and  50s  The modern American consciousness on race will consider descendants of European ethnic groups assimilated to become part of the larger  White American  group  In the 1960s  amp   70s  African American and Puerto Rican political activism banded together to battle the common problems of racial discrimination  poverty and underpresentation in many urban areas across the US like in New York City  Also to note there was substantial intermarriage between the newly arrived Indian American  later came the Filipino and Hispanic communities in California under

Native Americans Popular culture  songs  theater  for European American audiences in the 19th century created and perpetuated negative stereotypes of African Americans  One key symbol of racism against African Americans was the use of blackface  Directly related to this was the institution of minstrelsy  Other stereotypes of African Americans included the fat  dark skinned  mammy  and the irrational  hypersexual male  buck   Other stereotypes include the portrayal of East Asians as very small people with huge front teeth  the portrayal of Native Americans as dangerous savages  the portrayal of Australians as blonde rednecks who do nothing but ride kangaroos and cook food on the barbie  and the portrayal of Frenchmen who wear berets and striped shirts  smoke  love watching Jerry

enacting tropes of scantily clothed women and men as thugs or pimps  Church organized groups have protested outside the residence of Phillipe Dauman  Upper East Side  New York  NY    president and chief executive officer of Viacom  and the residence of Debra L  Lee  Northwest Washington DC   chairman and chief executive of Black Entertainment Television  a unit of Viacom   Rev  Donald Coates  leader of a protest organization formed around the issue of the videos   Enough is Enough   said   In the wake of the Imus affair  I began to think that the African American community must be consistent in its outrage   The Clifton  Maryland minister has also said   Why are these corporations making these images normative and mainstream        I can talk about this in the church until I am blue in the face  but we need to take it outside   The NAACP and the National Congress of Black Women also have called for the reform of images on videos and on television  Julian Bond said that in a segregated society  people get their impressions of other groups from what they see in videos and what they hear in music  116  117  118  119  In a similar vein  activists protested against the BET show  Hot Ghetto Mess  which satirizes the culture of working class African Americans  The protests resulted in the change of the television show name to We Got to Do Better  116   edit  Congressional

states of the United States and enforced between 1876 and 1965  They mandated  separate but equal  status for black Americans  In reality  this led to treatment and accommodations that were almost always inferior to those provided to white Americans  The most important laws required that public schools  public places and public transportation  like trains and buses  have separate facilities for whites and blacks   These Jim Crow Laws were separate from the 1800 66 Black Codes  which had restricted the civil rights and civil liberties of African Americans   State sponsored school segregation was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1954 in Brown v  Board of Education  Generally  the remaining Jim Crow laws were overruled by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act  none were in effect at the end of the 1960s  Segregation continued even after the demise of the Jim Crow laws  Data on house prices and attitudes toward integration from suggest that in the mid 20th century  segregation was a product of collective actions taken by whites to exclude blacks from their neighborhoods  120  Segregation also took the form of redlining  the practice of denying or increasing the cost of services  such as banking  insurance  access to jobs  121  access to health care  122  or even supermarkets 123  to residents in certain  often racially determined  124  areas  Although in the United States informal discrimination and segregation have always existed  the practice called  redlining  began with the National Housing Act of 1934  which established the Federal Housing Administration  FHA   The practice was fought first through passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968  which prevents redlining when the criteria for redlining are based on race  religion  gender  familial status  disability  or ethnic origin   and later through the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977  which requires banks to apply the same lending criteria in all communities  125  Although redlining is illegal some argue that it continues to exist in other forms   edit  Contemporary issues Black White segregation is declining fairly consistently for most metropolitan areas and cities  Despite these pervasive patterns  many changes for individual areas are small  126  Thirty years after the civil rights era  the United States remains a residentially segregated society in which Blacks and Whites inhabit different neighborhoods of vastly different quality  127  128  Some researchers suggest that racial segregation may lead to disparities in health and mortality  Thomas LaVeist  1989  1993  tested the hypothesis that segregation would aid in explaining race differences in infant mortality rates across cities  Analyzing 176 large and midsized cities  LaVeist found support for the hypothesis  Since LaVeist s studies  segregation has received increased attention as a determinant of race disparities in mortality  129  Studies have shown that mortality rates for male and female African Americans are lower in areas with lower levels of residential segregation  Mortality for male and female Whites was not associated in either direction with residential segregation  130  Researchers Sharon A  Jackson  Roger T  Anderson  Norman J  Johnson and Paul D  Sorlie found that  after adjustment for family income  mortality risk increased with increasing minority residential segregation among Blacks aged 25 to 44 years and non Blacks aged 45 to 64 years  In most age race gender groups  the highest and lowest mortality risks occurred in the highest and lowest categories of residential segregation  respectively  These results suggest that minority residential segregation may influence mortality risk and underscore the traditional emphasis on the social underpinnings of disease and death  131  Rates of heart disease among African Americans are associated with the segregation patterns in the neighborhoods where they live  Fang et al  1998   Stephanie A  Bond Huie writes that neighborhoods affect health and mortality outcomes primarily in an indirect fashion through environmental factors such as smoking  diet  exercise  stress  and access to health insurance and medical providers  132  Moreover  segregation strongly influences premature mortality in the US  133   edit  Laws regarding race Main article  Race legislation in the United States  edit  Court cases regarding race  edit  Institutional racism Institutional racism is the theory that aspects of the structure  pervasive attitudes  and established institutions of society disadvantage some racial groups  although not by an overtly discriminatory mechanism  134  There are several factors that play into institutional racism  including but not limited to  accumulated wealth benefits from racial groups that have benefited from past discrimination  educational and occupational disadvantages faced by non native English speakers in the United States  ingrained stereotypical images that still remain in the society  e g  black men are likely to be criminals   135   edit  Immigration Access to United States citizenship was restricted by race  beginning with the Naturalization Act of 1790 which refused naturalization to  non whites   Many in the modern United States forget the institutionalized prejudice against white followers of Roman Catholicism who immigrated from countries such as Ireland  Germany  Italy and France  136  Other efforts include the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act and the 1924 National Origins Act  137  138  The Immigration Act of 1924 was aimed at further restricting the Southern and Eastern Europeans who had begun to enter the country in large numbers beginning in the 1890s  While officially prohibited  U S  officials continue to differentially apply laws on illegal immigration depending on national origin  essentially declining to enforce immigration laws against citizens of rich countries who overstay their visas  and personal economy  differentially awarding visas to foreign nationals based on bank accounts  properties and so on    edit  Wealth creation Massive racial differentials in account of wealth remain in the United States  between whites and African Americans  the gap is a factor of twenty  139  An analyst of the phenomenon  Thomas Shapiro  professor of law and social policy at Brandeis University argues   The wealth gap is not just a story of merit and achievement  it s also a story of the historical legacy of race in the United States   140  Differentials applied to the Social Security Act  which excluded agricultural workers  a sector that then included most black workers   rewards to military officers  and the educational benefits offered returning soldiers after World War II  Pre existing disparities in wealth are exacerbated by tax policies that reward investment over waged income  subsidize mortgages  and subsidize private sector developers  141  However  according to the US Census  the highest percentage of citizens in America living below the poverty line are white Americans  and not African Americans  142   edit  Slavery by non whites See also  Slavery in the United States Before removal and  under white influence   some Southern Native American tribes owned African American slaves  The Cherokee  Choctaw  and Chickasaw were known to have had slaves  However  unlike white slaveholders  they encouraged the young black slaves to attend the schools opened for the Indian children  The children they had with black women and men were raised in practical equality with their full blooded offspring    143  Unlike the United States before Emancipation  African Americans  and European Americans  were allowed to become citizens of their respective Native American nations  however  it was rare for African Americans to become citizens of Native American nations  For example  a small number of  Free People of Color  lived in many Native American nations as Cherokee  Choctaw  or Creek citizens  144   edit  Impact on health See also  Race and health In the US racial differences in health and quality of life often persist even at equivalent socioeconomics levels  Individual and institutional discrimination  along with the stigma of inferiority  can adversely affect health  Residence in poor neighborhoods  racial bias in medical care  the stress of experiences of discrimination and the acceptance of the societal stigma of inferiority can have deleterious consequences for health  145  Using The Schedule of Racist Events  SRE   an 18 item self report inventory that assesses the frequency of racist discrimination  Hope Landrine and Elizabeth A  Klonoff found that racist discrimination is rampant in the lives of African Americans and is strongly related to psychiatric symptoms  146  A study on racist events in the lives of African American women found that lifetime experiences of racism were positively related to lifetime history of both physical disease and frequency of recent common colds  These relationships were largely unaccounted for by other variables  Demographic variables such as income and education were not related to experiences of racism  The results suggest that racism can be detrimental to African American s well being  147  The physiological stress caused by racism has been documented in studies by Claude Steele  Joshua Aronson  and Steven Spencer on what they term  stereotype threat   148  Kennedy et al  found that both measures of collective disrespect were strongly correlated with black mortality  r   0 53 to 0 56   as well as with white mortality  r   0 48 to 0 54   These data suggest that racism  measured as an ecologic characteristic  is associated with higher mortality in both blacks and whites  149   edit  Health care inequality See also  Race and health They are major racial differences in access to health care and in the quality of health care provided  A study published in the American Journal of Public Health estimated that   over 886 000 deaths could have been prevented from 1991 to 2000 if African Americans had received the same care as whites   The key differences they cited were lack of insurance  inadequate insurance  poor service  and reluctance to seek care  150  A history of government sponsored experimentation  such as the notorious Tuskegee Syphilis Study has left a legacy of African American distrust of the medical system  151  Inequalities in health care may also reflect a systemic bias in the way medical procedures and treatments are prescribed for different ethnic groups  Raj Bhopal writes that the history of racism in science and medicine shows that people and institutions behave according to the ethos of their times and warns of dangers to avoid in the future  152  Nancy Krieger contended that much modern research supported the assumptions needed to justify racism  Racism she writes underlies unexplained inequities in health care  including treatment for heart disease  153  renal failure  154  bladder cancer  155  and pneumonia  156  Raj Bhopal writes that these inequalities have been documented in numerous studies  The consistent and repeated findings that black Americans receive less health care than white Americans particularly where this involves expensive new technology  157   edit  Political issues  edit  Affirmative action Main article  Affirmative action in the United States Affirmative action is a policy or program intended to promote access to education or employment for minority groups and women  Motivation for affirmative action policies is to redress the effects of past discrimination and to encourage public institutions such as universities  hospitals  and police forces to be more representative of the population  Affirmative action programs may include targeted recruitment efforts  preferential treatment given to applicants from historically disadvantaged groups  and in some cases the use of quotas  Most American universities and some employers practice affirmative action  citation needed  Some opponents of affirmative action view the greater access by women and minority groups to be at the expense of groups considered dominant  typically white men   In their view  these policies demonstrate an overt preference for applicants from particular backgrounds over better qualified  or equally qualified  candidates from other backgrounds  Some opponents of affirmative action believe the only consideration in choosing between applicants should be merit  Some also criticize affirmative action because they believe it perpetuates racial division instead of minimizing the importance of race in American society  158  Supporters of affirmative action believe that the perceived injustice to the dominant group is not supported by facts  They point to statistics that suggest that affirmative action has not resulted in fewer opportunities for white people  For example  white enrollment in universities has increased along with minority enrollment  In 1973  30  of white high school graduates attended universities  in 1993  after widespread implementation of affirmative action policies  that number had risen to 42   159  Some supporters of affirmative action point out that  even in the absence of affirmative action  college admissions rarely are purely merit based  athletes  musicians  and legacy students  children of alumni  have always been given preferential treatment  For example  Harvard University admits 35 40  of legacy applicants  and a rejected white applicant is more likely to have been displaced by a legacy student than by one who benefited from affirmative action  citation needed   edit  Hate crimes Main article  Hate crime Most hate crimes in the United States target victims on the basis of race or ethnicity  for Federal purposes  crimes targeting Hispanics based on that identity are considered based on ethnicity   Leading forms of bias cited in the FBI s Uniform Crime Reporting  UCR  Program  based on law enforcement agency filings are  anti black  anti Jewish  anti white  anti homosexual  and anti Hispanic bias in that order in both 2004 and 2005  160  There are more hate crimes against whites than against Hispanics  Asians  American Indians  and multiracial groups   a statistically expected trend given that there far more whites than other ethnic groups put together  By contrast  the National Criminal Victimization Survey  finds that per capita rates of hate crime victimization varied little by race or ethnicity  and the differences are not statistically significant  161  The New Century Foundation  a white nationalist organization founded by Jared Taylor  argues that blacks are more likely than whites to commit hate crimes  and that FBI figures inflate the number of hate crimes committed by whites by counting Hispanics as  white   162  Other analysts are sharply critical of the NCF s findings  referring to the criminological mainstream view that  Racial and ethnic data must be treated with caution  Existing research on crime has generally shown that racial or ethnic identity is not predictive of criminal behavior with data which has been controlled for social and economic factors   163  NCF s methodology and statistics are further sharply criticized as flawed and deceptive by anti racist activists Tim Wise and the Southern Poverty Law Center  164  165  The first post Jim Crow era hate crime to make sensational media attention was the beating death of Vincent Chin  an Asian American of Chinese descent in 1982  He was attacked by a mob of white assailants who were recently laid off from a Detroit area auto factory job and blamed the Japanese for their individual unemployment  Chin was not of Japanese descent  but the assailants testified at the criminal court case that he  looked like a Jap   an ethnic slur used to describe
