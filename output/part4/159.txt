officially the Kingdom of Norway  is a Nordic unitary constitutional monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula  Jan Mayen  and the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard and Bouvet Island  note 1  Norway has a total area of 385 252 square kilometres  148 747 sq mi  and a population of about 5 million  9  It is the second least densely populated country in Europe  The majority of the country shares a border to the east with Sweden  its northernmost region is bordered by Finland to the south and Russia to the east  in its south Norway borders the Skagerrak Strait across from Denmark  The capital city of Norway is Oslo  Norway s extensive coastline  facing the North Atlantic Ocean and the Barents Sea  is home to its famous fjords  Two centuries of Viking raids tapered off following the adoption of Christianity by King Olav Tryggvason in 994  A period of civil war ended in the 13th century when Norway expanded its control overseas to parts of the British Isles  Iceland  and Greenland  Norwegian territorial power peaked in 1265  but competition from the Hanseatic League and the spread of the Black Death weakened the country  In 1380  Norway was absorbed into a union with Denmark that lasted more than four centuries  In 1814  Norwegians resisted the cession of their country to Sweden and adopted a new constitution  Sweden then invaded Norway but agreed to let Norway keep its constitution in return for accepting the union under a Swedish king  Rising nationalism throughout the 19th century led to a 1905 referendum granting Norway independence  Although Norway remained neutral in World War I  it suffered heavy losses to its shipping  Norway proclaimed its neutrality at the outset of World War II  but was nonetheless occupied for five years by the Third Reich  In 1949  neutrality was abandoned and Norway became a founding member of NATO  Discovery of oil and gas in adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway s economic fortunes  In referenda held in 1972 and 1994  Norway rejected joining the EU  Key domestic issues include immigration and integration of ethnic minorities  maintaining the country s extensive social safety net with an aging population  and preserving economic competitiveness  2  10  Norway is a unitary parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy  with King Harald V as its head of state and Jens Stoltenberg as its prime minister  It is a unitary state with administrative subdivisions on two levels known as counties  fylke  and municipalities  kommuner   The S mi people have a certain amount of self determination and influence over traditional territories through the S mi Parliament and the Finnmark Act  Although having rejected European Union membership in two referenda  Norway maintains close ties with the union and its member countries  as well as with the United States  Norway remains one of the biggest financial contributors to the United Nations  11  and participates with UN forces in international missions  notably in Afghanistan  Kosovo  Sudan and Libya  Norway is a founding member of the United Nations  NATO  the Council of Europe  and the Nordic Council  a member of the European Economic Area  the WTO  and the OECD  and is also a part of Schengen Area  Norway has extensive reserves of petroleum  natural gas  minerals  lumber  seafood  fresh water  and hydropower  The country has the fourth highest GDP per capita in the world  On a per capita basis  it is the world s largest producer of oil and natural gas outside the Middle East  12  13  and the petroleum industry accounts for around a quarter of the country s gross domestic product  14  The country maintains a Nordic welfare model with universal health care  subsidized higher education  and a comprehensive social security system  From 2001 to 2006  15  and then again from 2009 through 2011  Norway has had the highest human development index ranking in the world  16  17

 way north  or the  north way    which in Old Norse would have been nor veg or  nor  vegr  The Old Norse name for Norway was N regr  the Anglo Saxon Nor  weg and mediaeval Latin Northvegia  The present name of the Kingdom of Norway in Bokm l is  Kongeriket Norge  and in Nynorsk  Kongeriket Noreg   both only a couple of letters removed from the original  northern way   Nor d   v e g  History Main articles  History of Norway and History of Scandinavia Prehistory Approximate extent of the Corded Ware culture  Nordic Bronze Age rock carvings at Steinkjer  Central Norway Main article  Scandinavian prehistory The first inhabitants were the Ahrensburg culture  11th to 10th millennia BC  which was a late Upper Paleolithic culture during the Younger Dryas  the last spell of cold at the end of the Weichsel glaciation  The culture is named after village of Ahrensburg  25 km  15 53 mi  northeast of Hamburg in the German state of Schleswig Holstein where wooden arrow shafts and clubs have been excavated  18  The earliest traces of human occupation in Norway are found along the coast  where the huge ice shelf of the last ice age first melted between 11 000 and 8 000 BC  The oldest finds are stone tools dating from 9 500 to 6 000 BC  discovered in Finnmark  Komsa culture  in the north and Rogaland  Fosna culture  in the southwest  However  theories about two altogether different cultures  the Komsa culture north of the Arctic Circle being one and the Fosna culture from Tr ndelag to Oslo Fjord being the other  were rendered obsolete in the 1970s  More recent finds along the entire coast revealed to archaeologists that the difference between the two can simply be ascribed to different types of tools and not to different cultures  Coastal fauna provided a means of livelihood for fishermen and hunters  who may have made their way along the southern coast about 10 000 BC when the interior was still covered with ice  It is now thought that these so called  Arctic  peoples came from the south and followed the coast northward considerably later  Some may have come along the ice free coast of the Kola Peninsula  but the evidence of this is still poor  In the southern part of the country are dwelling sites dating from about 5 000 BC  Finds from these sites give a clearer idea of the life of the hunting and fishing peoples  The implements vary in shape and mostly are made of different kinds of stone  those of later periods are more skillfully made  Rock carvings  i  e  petroglyphs  have been found  usually near hunting and fishing grounds  They represent game such as deer  reindeer  elk  bears  birds  seals  whales  and fish  especially salmon and halibut   all of which were vital to the way of life of the coastal peoples  The carvings at Alta in Finnmark  the largest in Scandinavia  were made at sea level continuously from 4 200 to 500 BC and mark the progression of the land as it rose from the sea after the last ice age  Rock carvings at Alta   Bronze Age Main article  Nordic Bronze Age S b  sword from S b   Hordaland  800 AD  Between 3000 and 2500 BC new settlers  Corded Ware culture  arrived in eastern Norway  They were Indo European farmers who grew grain and kept cows and sheep  The hunting fishing population of the west coast was also gradually replaced by farmers  though hunting and fishing remained useful secondary means of livelihood  From about 1500 BC bronze was gradually introduced  but the use of stone implements continued  Norway had few riches to barter for bronze goods  and the few finds consist mostly of elaborate weapons and brooches that only chieftains could afford  Huge burial cairns built close to the sea as far north as Harstad and also inland in the south are characteristic of this period  The motifs of the rock carvings differ from those typical of the Stone Age  Representations of the Sun  animals  trees  weapons  ships  and people are all strongly stylized  probably as fertility symbols connected with the religious ideas of the period  Iron Age Main article  Pre Roman Iron Age Little has been found dating from the early Iron Age  the last 500 years BC   The dead were cremated  and their graves contain few burial goods  During the first four centuries AD the people of Norway were in contact with Roman occupied Gaul  About 70 Roman bronze cauldrons  often used as burial urns  have been found  Contact with the civilized countries farther south brought a knowledge of runes  the oldest known Norwegian runic inscription dates from the 3rd century  At this time the amount of settled area in the country increased  a development that can be traced by coordinated studies of topography  archaeology  and place names  The oldest root names  such as nes  vik  and b    cape    bay   and  farm    are of great antiquity  dating perhaps from the Bronze Age  whereas the earliest of the groups of compound names with the suffixes vin   meadow   or heim   settlement    as in Bjorgvin  Bergen  or Saeheim  Seim   usually date from the 1st century AD  Migration Age Main article  Migration Age The destruction of the Western Roman Empire by the Germanic tribes  5th century  is characterized by rich finds  including chieftains  graves containing magnificent weapons and gold objects  Hill forts were built on precipitous rocks for defense  Excavation has revealed stone foundations of farmhouses 60 to 90 feet  18 to 27 metres  long one even 150 feet  46 metres  long the roofs of which were supported on wooden posts  These houses were family homesteads where several generations lived together  with people and cattle under one roof  From this period and later  600 800   nascent communities can be traced  Defense works require cooperation and leadership  so petty states of some kind with a defense and administrative organization must have existed  These states were based on either clans or tribes  e g   the Horder of Hordaland in western Norway   By the 9th century each of these small states had things  or tings  local or regional assemblies   for negotiating and settling disputes  The thing meeting places  each eventually with a horg  open air sanctuary  or a hov  temple  literally  hill    were usually situated on the oldest and best farms  which belonged to the chieftains and wealthiest farmers  The regional things united to form even larger units  assemblies of deputy yeomen from several regions  In this way  the lagting  assemblies for negotiations and lawmaking  developed  The Gulating had its meeting place by Sognefjord and may have been the centre of an aristocratic confederation along the western fjords and islands called the Gulatingslag  The Frostating was the assembly for the leaders in the Trondheimsfjord area  the earls Jarls of Lade  near Trondheim  seem to have enlarged the Frostatingslag by adding the coastland from Romsdalsfjord to the Lofoten Islands  A lagting developed in the area of Lake Mj sa in the east and eventually established its meeting place at Eidsvoll  becoming known as the Eidsivating  The area around Oslofjord  although at times closely tied to Denmark  developed a lagting with its meeting place at Sarpsborg called the Borgarting  Viking Age Main article  Viking Age The helmet found at Gjermundbu near Haugsbygd  Buskerud  is the only Viking Age helmet that has been found  The Gokstad ship at the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo  Norway  The Norwegian Kingdom at its greatest extent  c  1265 The Viking Age was characterized by expansion and emigration by Viking seafarers  According to tradition  Harald Fairhair  Harald H rfagre  unified them into one in 872 after the Battle of Hafrsfjord in Stavanger  thus becoming the first king of a united Norway   The date of 872 may be somewhat arbitrary  In fact  the actual date may be just prior to 900   19  Harald s realm was mainly a South Norwegian coastal state  Harald Fairhair ruled with a strong hand and  according to the sagas  many Norwegians left the country to live in Iceland  the Faroe Islands  Greenland  and parts of Britain and Ireland  The modern day Irish cities of Dublin  Limerick  and Waterford were founded by Norwegian  and Danish  settlers  20 Norse traditions were slowly replaced by Christian ones in the 10th and 11th Centuries  This is largely attributed to the missionary kings Olav Tryggvasson and St  Olav  Haakon the Good was Norway s first Christian king  in the mid 10th century  though his attempt to introduce the religion was rejected  Born sometime in between 963 969  Olav Tryggvasson set off raiding in England with 390 ships  He attacked London during this raiding  Arriving back in Norway in 995  Olav landed in Moster  21  There he built a church which became the first Christian church ever built in Norway  21  From Moster  Olav sailed north to Trondheim were he was acclaimed King of Norway by the Eyrathing in 995  21  Feudalism never really developed in Norway and Sweden  as it did in the rest of Europe  22  However  the administration of government took on a very conservative feudal character  22  The Hanseatic League forced the royalty to cede to them greater and greater concessions over foreign trade and the economy  22  The League had this hold over the royalty because of the loans the Hansa had made to the royalty and the large debt the kings were carrying  22  The League s monopolistic control over the economy of Norway put pressure on all classes  especially the peasantry  to the degree that no real burgher class existed in Norway  22  Kalmar Union Main article  Kalmar Union Kalmar Union c  1500 AD Upon the death of Haakon V  King of Norway  in 1319  three year old Magnus Erikson inherited the throne as King Magnus VII of Norway  23  At the same time a movement to make Magnus King of Sweden proved successful  23   At this time both the kings of Sweden and of Denmark were elected to the throne by their respective nobles   23  Thus  with his election to the throne of Sweden  both Sweden and Norway were united under King Magnus VII  23  In 1349  the Black Death radically altered Norway  killing between 50  and 60  of its population 24  and leaving it in a period of social and economic decline  25  The plague left Norway very poor  26  Although the death rate was comparable with the rest of Europe  economic recovery took much longer because of the small  scattered population  25  Before the plague  total population was only about 500 000 people  27  After the plague  many farms lay idle while the population slowly increased  25  The few surviving farms  tenants found their bargaining positions with their landlords greatly strengthened  25  King Magnus VII ruled Norway until 1350  when his son  Haakon  was placed on the throne as Haakon VI  28  In 1363  Haakon VI married Margaret  the daughter of King Valdemar IV of Denmark  25  Upon the death of Haakon VI  in 1379  his son  Olaf IV  was only 10 years old  25  Olaf had already been elected to the throne of Denmark on May 3  1376  25  Thus  upon Olaf s ascension to the throne of Norway  Denmark and Norway entered personal union  29  Olaf s mother and Haakon s widow  Queen Margaret  managed the foreign affairs of Denmark and Norway during the minority of Olaf IV  25  Margaret was working toward a union of Sweden with Denmark and Norway by having Olaf elected to the Swedish throne  She was on the verge of achieving this goal when Olaf IV suddenly died  25  However  Denmark made Margaret temporary ruler upon the death of Olaf  On February 2  1388  Norway followed suit and crowned Margaret  25  Queen Margaret knew that her power would be more secure if she were able to find a king to rule in her place  She settled on Eric of Pomerania  grandson of her sister  Thus at an all Scandinavian meeting held at Kalmar  Erik of Pomerania was crowned king of all three Scandinavian countries  Thus  royal politics resulted in personal unions between the Nordic countries  eventually bringing the thrones of Norway  Denmark  and Sweden under the control of Queen Margaret when the country entered into the Kalmar Union  Union with Denmark Main article  Denmark Norway After Sweden broke out of the Kalmar Union in 1521  Norway remained with Denmark until 1814  a total of 436 years  During the national romanticism of the 19th century  this period was by some referred to as the  400 Year Night   since all of the kingdom s royal  intellectual  and administrative power was centred in Copenhagen in Denmark  With the introduction of Protestantism in 1536  the archbishopric in Trondheim was dissolved  and Norway effectually became a tributary to Denmark  and the church s incomes were distributed to the court in Copenhagen instead  Norway lost the steady stream of pilgrims to the relics of St  Olav at the Nidaros shrine  and with them  much of the contact with cultural and economic life in the rest of Europe  Additionally  Norway saw its land area decrease in the 17th century with the loss of the provinces B huslen  Jemtland  and Herjedalen to Sweden  as a result of numerous wars between Denmark Norway and Sweden  To the north  however  its territory was increased by the acquisition of the northern provinces of Troms and Finnmark  at the expense of Sweden and Russia  The famine of 1695 96 killed roughly 10  of Norway s population  30  At least nine severe harvest failures were recorded in the Scandinavian countries between 1740 and 1800  each resulting in a substantial rise of the death rate  31  Union with Sweden  19th century  Main article  Union between Sweden and Norway The 1814 constitutional assembly  painted by Oscar Wergeland After Denmark Norway was attacked by the United Kingdom at the Battle of Copenhagen  it entered into an alliance with Napoleon  with the war leading to dire conditions and mass starvation in 1812  As the Danish kingdom found itself on the losing side in 1814  it was forced  under terms of the Treaty of Kiel  to cede Norway to the king of Sweden  while the old Norwegian provinces of Iceland  Greenland and the Faroe Islands remained with the Danish crown  32  Norway took this opportunity to declare independence  adopted a constitution based on American and French models  and elected the Crown prince of Denmark and Norway  Christian Frederick  as king on 17 May 1814  This is the famous Syttende Mai  Seventeenth of May  holiday celebrated by Norwegians and Norwegian Americans alike  Syttende Mai is also called Norwegian Constitution Day  Norwegian opposition to the great powers  decision to link Norway with Sweden caused the Norwegian Swedish War to break out as Sweden tried to subdue Norway by military means  As Sweden s military was not strong enough to defeat the Norwegian forces outright and Norway s treasury was not large enough to support a protracted war  and as British and Russian navies blockaded the Norwegian coast  33  the belligerents were forced to negotiate the Convention of Moss  According to the terms of the convention  Christian Frederik abdicated the Norwegian throne and authorized the Parliament of Norway to make the necessary constitutional amendments to allow for the personal union that Norway was forced to accept  On November 4  1814  the Parliament  Storting  elected Charles XIII of Sweden as king of Norway  thereby establishing the union with Sweden  34  Under this arrangement  Norway kept its liberal constitution and its own independent institutions  except for the foreign service  Following the recession caused by the Napoleonic Wars  economic development of Norway remained slow until economic growth began around 1830  35  This period also saw the rise of the Norwegian romantic nationalism  as Norwegians sought to define and express a distinct national character  The movement covered all branches of culture  including literature  Henrik Wergeland  1808 1845   Bj rnstjerne Bj rnson  1832

Norwegian Museum of Cultural History  King Karl XIV Johan  who came to the throne of Norway and Sweden in 1818  was the second king following Norway s break from Denmark and the union with Sweden  Karl Johan was a complex man whose long reign extended to 1844  King Karl Johan protected the constitution and liberties of Norway and Sweden during the age of Metternich  As such  he was regarded as a liberal monarch for that age  However  he was ruthless in his use of paid informers  the secret police and restrictions on the freedom of the press to put down public movements for reform especially the Norwegian national independence movement  36  A Sami  Lapp  family in Norway around 1900  The Romantic Era that followed the reign of King Karl Johan brought some significant social and political reforms  In 1854  women were given the right to inherit property in their own right just like men  37  In 1863  the last trace of keeping unmarried women in the status of minors was removed  37  Furthermore  women were then eligible for different occupations  particularly the common school teacher  37  However  by mid century  Norway was still far from a  democracy   Voting was limited to officials  property owners  leaseholders  and burghers of incorporated towns  38  There was some dissatisfaction with this backwardness  Still Norway remained a conservative society  Life in Norway  especially economic life  was  dominated by the aristocracy of professional men who filled most of the important posts in the central government   39  There was no strong bourgeosie class in Norway to demand a breakdown of this aristocratic control of the economy  40  Thus  even while revolution swept over most of the countries of Europe in 1848  Norway was largely unaffected by revolts that year  Most revolts broke themselves on the granite conservativism of the Norwegian society  40  Indeed  the Thrane movement was the only  revolt  that broke out in Norway in 1848  Marcus Thrane was a Utopian socialist  41  He made his appeal to the labouring classes urging a change of social structure  from below upwards   41  In 1848  he organized a labour society in Drammen  In just a few months this society had a membership of 500 and the society was publishing its own newspaper  41  Within two years 300 societies had been organized all over Norway with a total membership of 20 000 persons  41  The membership was drawn from the lower classes of both the town and country  41  For the first time these two groups felt they had common cause with each other  41  In the end  the revolt was easily crushed  Thrane was captured and sentenced to three years in jail for crimes against the safety of the state  Upon his release from jail  after serving his sentence  Marcus Thrane migrated to the United States of America  In 1898  all men were granted universal suffrage  followed by all women in 1913  Independence Main article  Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905 Christian Michelsen  a shipping magnate and statesman  Prime Minister of Norway from 1905 to 1907  played a central role in the peaceful separation of Norway from Sweden on 7 June 1905  After a national referendum confirmed the people s preference for a monarchy over a republic  the Norwegian government offered the throne of Norway to the Danish Prince Carl  and Parliament unanimously elected him king  the first king of a fully independent Norway in 586 years  He took the name of Haakon VII  after the mediaeval kings of independent Norway  World War I and II See also  Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany and Free Norwegian Forces Scenes from the Norwegian Campaign in 1940 During World War I  Norway was a neutral country  In reality  however  Norway had been pressured by the United Kingdom to hand over increasingly large parts of its massive merchant fleet to the UK at low rates  as well as to join the trade blockade against Germany  citation needed  Norwegian merchant marine ships with Norwegian sailors were then required to sail under the British flag and risk being sunk by German submarines  42  Thus  many Norwegian sailors and ships were lost  42  Thereafter  the world ranking of the Norwegian merchant marine fell from fourth place in the world to sixth place in the world  42  Norway also proclaimed its neutrality during World War II  but Norway was invaded by German forces on 9 April 1940  Norway was unprepared for the German surprise attack  see  Battle of Dr bak Sound  Norwegian Campaign  and Invasion of Norway   but military and naval resistance lasted for two months  The armed forces in the north launched an offensive against the German forces in the Battles of Narvik  until they were forced to surrender on June 10 after losing British help diverted to France during the German Invasion of France  King Haakon and the Norwegian government escaped to Rotherhithe  London  England  and they supported the fight through inspirational radio speeches from London and by supporting clandestine military actions in Norway against the Nazis  On the day of the invasion  the collaborative leader of the small National Socialist party Nasjonal Samling  Vidkun Quisling  tried to seize power but was forced by the German occupiers to step aside  Real power was wielded by the leader of the German occupation authority  Reichskommissar Josef Terboven  Quisling  as minister president  later formed a collaborationist government under German control  Up to 15 000 Norwegians volunteered to fight in German units  including the Waffen SS  43  There were also many Norwegians  and those of Norwegian descent  who joined the Allied forces as well as the Free Norwegian Forces  From the small group that had left Norway in June 1940 consisting of 13 ships  five aircraft and 500 men from the Royal Norwegian Navy who followed the King to the United Kingdom the force had grown by the end of the war to 58 ships and 7 500 men in service in the Norwegian Navy  5 squadrons of aircraft  including Spitfires  Sunderland flying boats and Mosquitos  in the newly formed Norwegian Air Force  and land forces including the Norwegian Independent Company 1 and 5 Troop as well as No  10 Commandos  During the five years of Nazi occupation  Norwegians built a resistance movement which fought the German occupation forces with both civil disobedience and armed resistance including the destruction of Norsk Hydro s heavy water plant and stockpile of heavy water at Vemork  which crippled the German nuclear program  see  Norwegian heavy water sabotage   More important to the Allied war effort  however  was the role of the Norwegian Merchant Marine  At the time of the invasion  Norway had the fourth largest merchant marine fleet in the world  It was led by the Norwegian shipping company Nortraship under the Allies throughout the war and took part in every war operation from the evacuation of Dunkirk to the Normandy landings  Each December Norway gives a Christmas tree to the United Kingdom as thanks for the British assistance during World War II  A ceremony takes place to erect the tree in London s famous Trafalgar Square  44  Post war history From 1945 to 1962  the Labour Party held an absolute majority in the parliament  The government  led by prime minister Einar Gerhardsen  embarked on a program inspired by Keynesian economics  emphasizing state financed industrialization  cooperation between trade unions and employers  organizations  Many measures of state control of the economy imposed during the war were continued  although the rationing of dairy products was lifted in 1949  while price control and rationing of housing and cars continued as long as until 1960  The wartime alliance with the United Kingdom and the United States was continued in the post war years  Although pursuing the goal of a socialist economy  the Labour Party distanced itself from the communists  especially after Soviet seizure of power in Czechoslovakia in 1948   and strengthened its foreign policy and defence policy ties with the U S  Norway received Marshall Plan aid from the United States starting in 1947  joined the OEEC one year later and became a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO  in 1949  Around 1975  both the proportion and absolute number of workers in industry peaked  Since then labour intensive industries and services like factory mass production and shipping have largely been outsourced  In 1969  the Phillips Petroleum Company discovered petroleum resources at the Ekofisk field west of Norway  In 1973  the Norwegian government founded the State oil company  Statoil  Oil production did not provide net income until the early 1980s because of the large capital investment that was required to establish the country s petroleum industry  Norway was a founding member of the European Free Trade Area  EFTA   Two referendums on joining the European Union failed by narrow margins in 1972 and 1994  In 1981  a Conservative government led by K re Willoch replaced the Labour Party with a policy of stimulating the stagflated economy with tax cuts  economic liberalization  deregulation of markets  and measures to curb the record high inflation  13 6  in 1981   Norway s first female prime minister  Gro Harlem Brundtland of the Labour party  continued many of the reforms of her right wing predecessor  while backing traditional Labour concerns such as social security  high taxes  the industrialization of nature  and feminism  By the late 1990s  Norway had paid off its foreign debt and had started accumulating a sovereign wealth fund  Since the 1990s  a divisive question in politics has been how much of the income from petroleum

much of the country is dominated by mountainous or high terrain  with a great variety of natural features caused by prehistoric glaciers and varied topography  The most noticeable of these are the fjords  deep grooves cut into the land flooded by the sea following the end of the Ice Age  The longest is Sognefjorden at 204 kilometres  127 mi   Sognefjorden is the world s second deepest fjord  and the world s longest  Hornindalsvatnet is the deepest lake in all Europe  46 Frozen ground all year can be found in the higher mountain areas and in the interior of Finnmark county  Numerous glaciers are found in Norway  Norway lies between latitudes 57  and 81  N  and longitudes 4  and 32  E  The land is mostly made of hard granite and gneiss rock  but slate  sandstone and limestone are also common  and the lowest elevations contain marine deposits  Because of the Gulf Stream and prevailing westerlies  Norway experiences higher temperatures and more precipitation than expected at such northern latitudes  especially along the coast  The mainland experiences four distinct seasons  with colder winters and less precipitation inland  The northernmost part has a mostly maritime Subarctic climate  while Svalbard has an Arctic tundra climate  Because of the large latitudinal range of the country and the varied topography and climate  Norway has a larger number of different habitats than almost any other European country  There are approximately 60 000 species in Norway and adjacent waters  excluding bacteria and virus   The Norwegian Shelf large marine ecosystem is considered highly productive  47  Climate The southern and western parts of Norway experience more precipitation and have milder winters than the southeastern part  The lowlands around Oslo have the warmest and sunniest summers but also cold weather and snow in wintertime  especially inland   Because of Norway s high latitude  there are large seasonal variations in daylight  From late May to late July  the sun never completely descends beneath the horizon in areas north of the Arctic Circle  hence Norway s description as the  Land of the Midnight Sun    and the rest of the country experiences up to 20 hours of daylight per day  Conversely  from late November to late January  the sun never rises above the horizon in the north  and daylight hours are very short in the rest of the country

Norwegian parliamentary election  2009 Harald V  the King of Norway since 1991 According to the Constitution of Norway  which was adopted on 16 May 1814 52  and inspired by the United States Declaration of Independence and French Revolution of 1776 and 1789  respectively  Norway is a unitary constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of government  wherein the King of Norway is the head of state and the Prime Minister is the head of government  Power is separated between the legislative  executive and judicial branches of government  as defined by the Constitution  which serves as the country s supreme legal document  The Monarch officially retains executive power  however  following the introduction of a parliamentary system of government  the duties of the Monarch have since become strictly representative and ceremonial  53  such as the formal appointment and dismissal of the Prime Minister and other ministers in the executive government  Accordingly  the Monarch is commander in chief of the Norwegian armed forces  supreme authority in the Church of Norway  and serves as chief diplomatic official abroad and a symbol of unity  In practice  it is the Prime Minister who is responsible for the exercise of executive powers  Since his accession in 1991  Harald V of the House of Schleswig Holstein Sonderburg Gl cksburg has been King of Norway  the first since the 14th century who has actually been born in the country  54 Haakon  Crown Prince of Norway is the legal and rightful heir to the throne and the Kingdom  The Storting is the Parliament of Norway Constitutionally  legislative power is vested with both the government and the Parliament of Norway  but the latter is the supreme legislature and a unicameral body  55  A proposition can become a law or an act by simple majority amongst the 150 representatives  who are elected on the basis of proportional representation from 19 constituencies for four year terms  An additional 19 seats   levelling seats   are allocated on a nationwide basis to make the representation in parliament correspond better with the popular vote  As a result  there are currently 169 Members of Parliament altogether  There is also a 4  election threshold to gain levelling seats in Parliament  56  As such  Norway is fundamentally structured as a representative democracy  Effectively called the Stortinget  meaning Grand Assembly  members of Parliament ratify treaties and can impeach members of the government if their acts are declared unconstitutional  and as such have the power to remove them from office in case of an impeachment trial  Jens Stoltenberg  the Prime Minister of Norway since 2005 The position of Prime Minister  Norway s head of government  is allocated to the Member of Parliament who can obtain the confidence of a majority in Parliament  usually the current leader of the largest political party or more effectively through a coalition of parties  as a single party normally does not have the support to form a government on its own  However  Norway has often been ruled by minority governments  The Prime Minister nominates the Cabinet  traditionally drawn from members of the same political party in the Storting  to which they are responsible  and as such forms the executive government and exercises power vested to them by the Constitution  57  In order to form a government  however  more than half the membership of the Cabinet is required to belong to the Church of Norway  Currently  this means at least ten out of the 19 ministries  This has sparked controversy regarding an ongoing debate of separation of church and state in Norway  The current Prime Minister is Jens Stoltenberg  the leader of the Norwegian Labour Party  AP   Royal Palace of Norway in Oslo Through the Council of State  a privy council presided over by the Monarch  the Prime Minister and the Cabinet meet at the Royal Palace and formally consult the Monarch  Besides enacting parliamentary bills  all government bills need the formal approval by the Monarch before and after introduction to Parliament  Approval is also given by the Council to all of the Monarch s actions as head of state  Although all government and parliamentary acts are decided beforehand  the privy council is an example of another symbolic gesture the King obtains  54  Members of the Storting are directly elected from party lists proportional representation in nineteen plural member constituencies in a national multi party system  58  Historically  both the Norwegian Labour Party and Conservative Party have played leading political roles  while the former has remained in power since the 2005 election  in a Red Green Coalition with the Socialist Left Party and the Centre Party  59  Since then  both the Conservative Party and the Progress Party have won great amount of seats in the Parliament  however  as of the 2009 general election  not sufficient enough to overthrow the coalition  This has been the result of poor cooperation between the opposition parties  including the Liberal Party and the Christian Democratic Party  As such  Jens Stoltenberg  the leader of the Labour Party  remains Prime Minister of Norway with the necessary majority attributed to the alliance with the Socialist Left and Centre parties  60  Administrative divisions Main articles  Administrative divisions of Norway  Counties of Norway  Municipalities of Norway  List of towns and cities in Norway  and Dependencies of Norway Norway  a unitary state  is divided into nineteen first level administrative counties  fylker   The counties are administrated through directly elected county assemblies who elect the County Governor  Additionally  the King and government are represented in every county by a fylkesmann  who effectively acts as a Governor  61  As such  the Government is directly represented at a local level through the County Governors  offices  The counties are then sub divided into 430 second level municipalities  kommuner   which in turn are administrated by directly elected municipal council  headed by a mayor and a small executive cabinet  The capital of Oslo is considered both a county and a municipality  Norway also has two integral overseas territories  Jan Mayen and Svalbard  There are three Antarctic and Subantarctic dependencies  Bouvet Island  Peter I Island and Queen Maud Land  In addition  there are 96 settlements with city status in Norway  In most cases  the city borders are coterminous with the borders of their respective municipalities  Often  Norwegian city municipalities include large non built up areas  for example  Oslo municipality contains large forests  located north and southeast of the city  and over half of Bergen municipality consists of mountainous areas  62  A geopolitical map of Norway  showing the 19 fylker  the Svalbard  Spitsbergen  and Jan Mayen islands  which are part of the Norwegian kingdom The

uses a civil law system where laws are created and amended in Parliament and the system regulated through the Courts of Justice of Norway  It consists of the Supreme Court of 19 permanent judges and a Chief Justice  appellate courts  city and district courts  and conciliation councils  63  The judiciary  although traditionally a third branch of government  is independent of executive and legislative branches  While the Prime Minister nominates Supreme Court Justices for office  their nomination must be approved by Parliament and formally confirmed by the Monarch in the Council of State  Usually  judges attached to regular courts are formally appointed by the Monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister  The Courts  strict and formal mission is to regulate the Norwegian judicial system  interpret the Constitution  and as such implement the legislation adopted by Parliament and monitor the legislative and executive powers to ensure that they themselves comply with the acts of legislation that have been previously adopted  63  Law enforcement in Norway is carried out by the Norwegian Police Service  The Norwegian Police Service is a Unified National Police Service made up of 27 Police Districts and several specialist agencies like  kokrim and Kripos  each headed by a Chief of Police  The Police Service is headed by the National Police Directorate  which in turn is subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and the Police  the Police Directorate is headed by a National Police Commissioner  The only exception is the Norwegian Police Security Agency who answers directly to the Ministry of Justice and the Police  In its 2007 Worldwide Press Freedom Index  Reporters Without Borders ranked Norway at a shared 1st place  with Iceland  out of 169 countries  64

  Scandinavia has traditionally been considered more reluctant in relation to the process of European integration than other European countries  Norway did however follow suit when neighbouring Nordic countries issued applications for accession to the European Union  EU  in 1962  1967 and 1992  respectively  While Denmark  Sweden and Finland obtained membership  the treaties of accession which had been negotiated were rejected by the Norwegian electorate in 1972 and 1994  After the failed 1994 referendum  Norway maintained its membership in the European Economic Area  EEA   an arrangement which had been seen as a prerequisite for countries about to accede to the EU in 1995  This continues to grant the country access to the internal market of the Union  on the condition that Norway implements those of the Union s pieces of legislation which are deemed relevant to the internal market  counting approximately seven thousand as of 2010  66  Successive Norwegian governments have  since 1994  requested Norway s participation in parts of the EU s cooperation which go beyond the provisions of the EEA agreement  Non voting participation by Norway has been granted in for instance the Union s Common Security and Defence Policy  the Schengen Agreement  the European Defence Agency as well as 19 separate programmes  67  Norway has been considered a notable participant in international

functioning and stable country  Continued oil and gas exports coupled with a healthy economy and substantial accumulated wealth lead to a conclusion that Norway will remain among the richest countries in the world in the foreseeable future  The Norwegian economy is an example of a mixed economy  a prosperous capitalist welfare state featuring a combination of free market activity and large state ownership in certain key sectors  The Norwegian welfare state makes public health care free  above a certain level   and parents have 46 weeks paid 70  parental leave  The income that the state receives from natural resources includes a significant contribution from petroleum production and the substantial and carefully managed income related to this sector  Norway has a very low unemployment rate  currently 3 1   71  30  of the labour force are employed by the government  the highest in the OECD  72  22  are on welfare and 13  are too disabled to work  the highest proportions

that the wage difference between the lowest paid worker and the CEO of most companies is much smaller than in comparable western economies  citation needed  This is also evident in Norway s low Gini coefficient  The state has large ownership positions in key industrial sectors  such as the strategic petroleum sector  Statoil and Aker Solutions   hydroelectric energy production  Statkraft   aluminium production  Norsk Hydro   the largest Norwegian bank  DnB NOR   and telecommunication provider  Telenor   Through these big companies  the government controls approximately 30  of the stock values at the Oslo Stock Exchange  When non listed companies are included  the state has even higher share in ownership  mainly from direct oil license ownership   Norway is a major shipping nation and has the world s 6th largest merchant fleet  with 1 412 Norwegian owned merchant vessels  Bryggen in Bergen is on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites Referendums in 1972 and 1994 indicated that the Norwegian people wished to remain outside the European Union  EU   However  Norway  together with Iceland and Liechtenstein  participates in the European Union s single market via the European Economic Area  EEA  agreement  The EEA Treaty between the European Union countries and the EFTA countries  transposed into Norwegian law via  E S loven  74   describes the procedures for implementing European Union rules in Norway and the other EFTA countries  This makes Norway a highly integrated member of most sectors of the EU internal market  However  some sectors  such as agriculture  oil and fish  are not wholly covered by the EEA Treaty  Norway has also acceded to the Schengen Agreement and several other intergovernmental agreements between the EU member states  Agriculture is a significant sector  in spite of the mountainous landscape  Flakstad  The country is richly endowed with natural resources including petroleum  hydropower  fish  forests  and minerals  Large reserves of petroleum and natural gas were discovered in the 1960s  which led to a boom in the economy  Norway has obtained one of the highest standards of living in the world in part by having a large amount of natural resources compared to the size of the population  In 2011  28  of state revenues were generated from the petroleum industry  75  Resources Export revenues from oil and gas have risen to 45  of total exports and constitute more than 20  of the GDP  76  Norway is the fifth largest oil exporter and third largest gas exporter in the world  but it is not a member of OPEC  To reduce overheating in the economy from oil revenues and minimize uncertainty from volatility in oil price  and to provide a cushion for the effect of aging of the population  the Norwegian government in 1995 established the sovereign wealth fund   Government Pension Fund   Global    which would be funded with oil revenues  including taxes  dividends  sales revenues and licensing fees  Oil production has been a big part of the Norwegian economy since the 1970s  with a dominating state ownership  Statfjord oil field  The government controls its petroleum resources through a combination of state ownership in major operators in the oil fields  with approximately 62  ownership in Statoil in 2007  and the fully state owned Petoro  which has a market value of about twice Statoil  and SDFI  Finally  the government controls licensing of exploration and production of fields  The fund invests in developed financial markets outside Norway  The budgetary rule   Handlingsregelen   is to spend no more than 4  of the fund each year  assumed to be the normal yield from the fund   As of March 2011  the Government Pension Fund of Norway controlled assets valued at is approximately US 570 billion  equal to US 114 000 per capita  which is about 140  of Norway s current GDP  Currently it is the second largest state owned sovereign wealth fund  second only to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority  Conservative estimates tell that the fund may reach US 800 900 billion by 2017  Projections indicate that the Norwegian pension fund may become the largest capital fund in the world  The fund controls approximately 1 25  of all listed shares in Europe and more than 1  of all the publicly traded shares in the world  The Norwegian Central Bank operates investment offices in London  New York and Shanghai  Guidelines implemented in 2007 allow the fund to invest up to 60  of the capital in shares  maximum of 40  prior   while the rest may be placed in bonds and real estate  As the stock markets tumbled in September 2008  the fund was able to buy more shares at low prices  In this way  the losses incurred by the market turmoil was recuperated by November 2009  Stockfish has been exported from Lofoten in Norway for at least 1 000 years Other natural resource based economies  such as Russia  are trying to learn from Norway by establishing similar funds  The investment choices of the Norwegian fund are directed by ethical guidelines  for example  the fund is not allowed to invest in companies that produce parts for nuclear weapons  The highly transparent investment scheme is lauded by the international community  The future size of the fund is of course closely linked to the price of oil and to developments in international financial markets  The Norwegian trade surplus for 2008 reached approximately US 80 billion  With an enormous amount of cash invested in international financial markets  Norway has financial muscles to avert many of the worst effects of the financial crisis that hit most countries in the fall of 2008  As most western countries struggle with burgeoning foreign debt  Norway remains a nation of stowed away wealth  financial stability and economic power to meet the challenges of the worldwide economic crisis  In spite of the crisis  Norway still runs a 9  state budget surplus  being the only western country to run a surplus as of July 2009  In 2000  the government sold one third of the state owned oil company Statoil in an IPO  The next year  the main telecom supplier  Telenor  was listed on Oslo Stock Exchange  The state also owns significant shares of Norway s largest bank  DnB NOR and the airline SAS  Since 2000  economic growth has been rapid  pushing unemployment down to levels not seen since the early 1980s  unemployment in 2007  1 3    The international financial crisis has primarily affected the industrial sector  but unemployment has remained low and is at 3 3   86 000 people  in August 2011  Norway is among the least affected countries of the international economic downturn  Neighbouring Sweden is experiencing substantially higher actual and projected unemployment numbers as a result of the ongoing recession  and in the 1st quarter of 2009 the GNP of Norway surpassed Sweden s for the first time in history  despite a population numbering about half of Sweden s  Norway is also the world s second

services such as baptism  confirmation  marriage and burial  rites which have strong cultural standing in Norway  About 79 2  109  of Norwegians were members of the Church of Norway as of January 1  2010  However  only 20  of Norwegians say that religion occupies an important place in their life  according to a recent Gallup poll   the fourth lowest such percentage in the world  only Estonia  Sweden and Denmark are lower   110  In the early 1990s  it was estimated that between 4 7    5 3  of Norwegians attended church on a weekly basis  111  This figure has dropped to about 2    the lowest

Christianized  the indigenous Norse religion and practices were prohibited  Remnants of the native religion and beliefs of Norway survive today in the form of names  referential names of cities and locations  the days of the week  and other parts of the everyday language  Modern interest in the old ways has led to a revival of the pagan religious practices in the form of Asatru  The Norwegian

of Norway See also  Norwegian language and Sami languages Distribution of Norwegian dialect groups  North Norwegian  yellow   Tr ndelag Norwegian  navy blue   West Norwegian  orange  and East Norwegian  pale blue   The North Germanic Norwegian language has two official written forms  Bokm l and Nynorsk  Both of them are recognized as official languages  in that they are both used in public administration  in schools  churches  and media  and Bokm l is the written language used by the vast majority of about 80 85   Around 95  of the population speak Norwegian as their native language  although many speak dialects that may differ significantly from the written language  In general  most Norwegian dialects are inter intelligible  although some may require significant efforts on the part of a listener to understand  Several Uralic Sami languages are spoken and written throughout the country  especially in the north  by the Sami people  Speakers have a right to get education in Sami language no matter where they are living and receive communication from the government in various Sami languages  The Kven minority speak the Uralic Kven language Finnish  There is advocacy for making Norwegian Sign Language an official Norwegian language  In the 19th and 20th century  Norwegian language was subject to strong political and cultural controversy  which led to the creation of Nynorsk in the 19th century and to the formation of alternative spelling standards in the 20th century  notably the Riksm l standard  which is more conservative  that is  more similar to Danish  than Bokm l  Norwegian is similar to the other languages in Scandinavia  Swedish and Danish  All three languages are mutually intelligible and can be  and commonly are  employed in communication between inhabitants of the Scandinavian countries  As a result of the cooperation within the Nordic Council  inhabitants of all Nordic countries  including Iceland and Finland  have the right to communicate with the Norwegian authorities in their own language  Any Norwegian student who is a child of immigrant parents is encouraged to learn the Norwegian language  The Norwegian government offers language instructional courses for immigrants wishing to obtain Norwegian citizenship  From 1 September 2008  an applicant for Norwegian citizenship must also give evidence of proficiency in either the

mostly in the cities  Traditionally  English  German and French were considered the main foreign languages in Norway  These languages  for instance  had been used on Norwegian passports until the 1990s  and university students have a general right to use these languages when submitting their theses  Culture Main article  Culture of Norway The various regions of Norway have their own bunads  traditional costumes The unique Norwegian farm culture  sustained to this day  has resulted not only from scarce resources and a harsh climate but also from ancient property laws  In the 18th century  it brought about a strong romantic nationalistic movement  which is still visible in the Norwegian language and media  In the 19th century  Norwegian culture blossomed as efforts continued to achieve an independent identity in the areas of literature  art and music  This continues today in the performing arts and as a result of government support for exhibitions  cultural projects and artwork  127  Norway has been  in many regards  an early adopter of women s rights  minority rights  and LGBT rights  128  For example  in 1990 Norway was the first country to recognize the ILO convention 169 on indigenous people  and in 1913 become one of the first countries to grant women universal suffrage  without conditions on civil status   It was also the first independent nation to allow women to run for elected office  In regards to LGBT rights  Norway was the first country in the world to enact an anti discrimination law protecting the rights of gays and lesbians  In 1993 Norway became the second country to legalize civil union partnerships for same sex couples  and on January 1  2009  Norway became the sixth country to grant full marriage equality to same sex couples  However  only in 1990 was the Norwegian constitution altered to grant absolute primogeniture to the Norwegian throne  meaning that the eldest child  regardless of gender  takes precedence in the line of succession  This was not done retroactively  meaning that even now the current successor to the throne is not the eldest child to the King  but the eldest son  The Norwegian constitution Article 6 states that  For those born before the year 1990 it shall      be the case that a male shall take precedence over a female   129  An ardent promoter of human rights  Norway is home to the annual Oslo Freedom Forum conference  a gathering described by The Economist as  on its way to becoming a human rights equivalent of the Davos economic forum   130  Cinema Main article  Cinema of Norway Not until fairly recently has the Norwegian cinema received international recognition  but as early as 1951 a documentary film of the Kon Tiki expedition won an Oscar Academy Award  In 1959  Arne Skouen s Nine Lives

classical performers include Leif Ove Andsnes  one of the world s more famous pianists  Truls M rk  an outstanding cellist  and the great Wagnerian soprano Kirsten Flagstad  Since the 1990s  Norway s biggest cultural export is black metal  The lo fi  dark and raw form of heavy metal exploded in Norway during the 1990s and launched the careers of bands such as Darkthrone  Mayhem  Burzum  Emperor  Gorgoroth and Immortal  as well as later bands such as Dimmu Borgir  This development has since become an important part of extreme metal  but many events that took place in the early 1990s related to the black metal movement such as several church burnings and a prominent murder case caused some concern amongst the Norwegian citizens at large  The jazz scene in Norway is also thriving  Jan Garbarek  Terje Rypdal  Mari Boine  Arild Andersen  and Bugge Wesseltoft are internationally recognized while Paal Nilssen Love  Supersilent  Jaga Jazzist and Wibutee are becoming world class artists

poems and skaldic verse of the 9th and 10th centuries with poets such as Bragi Boddason and Eyvindr sk ldaspillir  The arrival of Christianity around the year 1000 brought Norway into contact with European mediaeval learning  hagiography and history writing  Merged with native oral tradition and Icelandic influence this was to flower into an active period of literature production in the late 12th and early 13th centuries  Major works of that period include Historia Norwegi    i rekssaga and Konungs skuggsj   Little Norwegian literature came out of the period of the Scandinavian Union and the subsequent Dano Norwegian union  1387 1814   with some notable exceptions such as Petter Dass and Ludvig Holberg  In his play Peer Gynt  Ibsen characterized this period as  Twice two hundred years of darkness brooded o er the race of monkeys   although the latter line is not as frequently quoted as the former  During the union with Denmark  written Norwegian was replaced by Danish  Henrik Ibsen Two major events precipitated a major resurgence in Norwegian literature  In 1811 a Norwegian university was established in Christiania  Seized by the spirit of revolution following the American and French Revolutions  the Norwegians signed their first Constitution in 1814  Soon  the cultural backwater that was Norway brought forth a series of strong authors recognized first in Scandinavia  and then worldwide  among them were Henrik Wergeland  Peter Christen Asbj rnsen  J rgen Moe and Camilla Collett  By the late 19th century  in the Golden Age of Norwegian literature  the so called Great Four emerged  Henrik Ibsen  Bj rnstjerne Bj rnson  Alexander Kielland  and Jonas Lie  Bj rnson s  peasant novels   such as  En glad gutt   A Happy Boy  and  Synn ve Solbakken  are typical of the national romanticism of their day  whereas Kielland s novels and short stories are mostly realistic  Although an important contributor to early Norwegian romantic nationalism  especially the ironic Peer Gynt   Henrik Ibsen s fame rests primarily on his pioneering realistic dramas such The Wild Duck and A Doll s House  many of which caused moral uproar because of their candid portrayals of the middle classes  In the 20th century  three Norwegian novelists were awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature  Bj rnstjerne Bj rnson in 1903  Knut Hamsun for the book  Markens gr de    Growth of the Soil   in 1920  and Sigrid Undset in 1928  Further important contributions to Norwegian literature were made by writers like Dag Solstad  Jon Fosse  Cora Sandel  Olav Duun  Olav H  Hauge  Gunvor Hofmo

Norway Urnes Stave Church has been listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site Norway has always had a tradition of building in wood  Indeed  many of today s most interesting new buildings are made of wood  reflecting the strong appeal that this material continues to hold for Norwegian designers and builders  135  Norway s conversion to Christianity some 1 000 years ago led to the introduction of stonework architecture  beginning with the construction of Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim  The small town R ros has small streets and old houses  In the early Middle Ages  stave churches were constructed throughout Norway  Many of them remain to this day and represent Norway s most important contribution to architectural history  A fine example is Urnes Stave Church which is now on UNESCO s World Heritage List  Another notable example of wooden architecture is the Bryggen Wharf in Bergen  consisting of a row of narrow wooden structures along the quayside  In the 17th century  under the Danish monarchy  cities such as Kongsberg with its Baroque church and R ros with its wooden buildings were established  After Norway s union with Denmark was dissolved in 1814  Oslo became the capital  Architect Christian H  Grosch designed the oldest parts of the University of Oslo  the Oslo Stock Exchange  and many other buildings and churches  At the beginning of the 20th century  the city of  lesund was rebuilt in the Art Nouveau style  The 1930s  when functionalism dominated  became a strong period for Norwegian architecture  but it is only in recent decades that Norwegian architects have truly achieved international renown  One of the most striking modern buildings in Norway is the Sami Parliament in K r  johka designed by Stein Halvorson and Christian Sundby  Its debating chamber is an abstract timber version of a Lavvo  the traditional tent used by the nomadic Sami people  136  Art Main article  Norwegian art For an extended period  the Norwegian art scene was dominated by artwork from Germany and Holland as well as by the influence of Copenhagen  It was in the 19th century that a truly Norwegian era began  first with portraits  later with even more impressive landscapes  Johan Christian Dahl  1788 1857   originally from the Dresden school  eventually returned to paint the landscapes of western Norway  defining Norwegian painting for the first time   137  Brudeferd i Hardanger by Adolph Tidemand og Hans Gude  1848 Norway s new found independence from Denmark encouraged painters to develop their Norwegian identity  especially with landscape painting by artists such as Kitty Kielland  a female painter who studied under Hans Gude  Harriet Backer  1845 1932  another pioneer among female artists  influenced by impressionism  Frits Thaulow  an impressionist  was influenced by the art scene in Paris as was Christian Krohg  a realist painter  famous for his paintings of prostitutes  138  Of particular note is Edvard Munch  a symbolist expressionist painter who became world famous for The Scream which is said to represent the anxiety of modern man  Other artists of note include Harald Sohlberg  a neo romantic painter remembered for his paintings of R ros  and Odd Nerdrum  a figurative painter who maintains his work is not art but kitsch  Cuisine Main article  Norwegian cuisine Norway s culinary traditions show the influence of long seafaring and farming traditions with salmon  fresh and cured   herring  pickled or marinated   trout  codfish and other seafood balanced by cheeses  dairy products and breads  predominantly dark
