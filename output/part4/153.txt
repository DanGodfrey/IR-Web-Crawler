to the north and China to the south  east and west  Although Mongolia does not share a border with Kazakhstan  its western most point is only 38 kilometres  24 mi  from Kazakhstan s eastern tip  Ulan Bator  the capital and largest city  is home to about 45  of the population  Mongolia s political system is a parliamentary republic  The area of what is now Mongolia has been ruled by various nomadic empires  including the Xiongnu  the Xianbei  the Rouran  the G kturks and others  The Mongol Empire was founded by Genghis Khan in 1206  After the collapse of the Yuan Dynasty  the Mongols returned to their earlier pattern of constant internal conflict and occasional raids on the Chinese borderlands  In the 16th and 17th centuries  Mongolia came under the influence of Tibetan Buddhism  At the end of the 17th century  all of Mongolia had been incorporated into the area ruled by the Qing Dynasty  During the collapse of the Qing Dynasty in 1911  Mongolia declared independence  but had to struggle until 1921 to firmly establish de facto independence from the Republic of China  and until 1945 to gain international recognition  As a consequence  clarification needed  it came under strong Russian and Soviet influence  in 1924  the Mongolian People s Republic was declared  and Mongolian politics began to follow the same patterns as the Soviet politics of the time  After the breakdown of communist regimes in Eastern Europe in late 1989  Mongolia saw its own Democratic Revolution in early 1990  which led to a multi party system  a new constitution in 1992  and transition to a market economy  At 1 564 116 square kilometres  603 909 sq mi   Mongolia is the 19th largest and the most sparsely populated independent country in the world  with a population of around 2 75 million people  It is also the world s second largest landlocked country after Kazakhstan  The country contains very little arable land  as much of its area is covered by steppes  with mountains to the north and west and the Gobi Desert to the south  Approximately 30  of the population are nomadic or semi nomadic  The predominant religion in Mongolia is Tibetan Buddhism  and the majority of the state s citizens are of the Mongol ethnicity  though Kazakhs  Tuvans  and other minorities also live in the country  especially in the west  About 20  of the population live on less than US 1 25 per day  8  Mongolia joined the World Trade Organization in 1997 and seeks to expand its participation in regional economic and trade regimes  12  Contents 1 History 1 1 Prehistory and antiquity 1 2 Middle Ages to

History Main article  History of Mongolia Prehistory and antiquity Deer stones in Mongolia Sites such as Tsagaan Agui  White Cave  in Bayankhongor Province show that Homo erectus inhabited Mongolia from 800 000 years ago  13  Modern humans reached Mongolia approximately 40 000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic  The Khoid Tsenkher Cave 14  in Khovd Province shows lively pink  brown and red ochre paintings  20 000 years ago  of mammoths  lynx  bactrian camels and ostriches  earning it the nickname  the Lascaux of Mongolia   The Mal ta Venus  21 000 years ago  testifies to the level of Upper Paleolithic art in northern Mongolia  though Mal ta is now part of Russia  Neolithic agricultural settlements  c  5500 3500 BC  such as those at Norovlin  Tamsagbulag  Bayanzag and Rashaan Khad predated the introduction of horse riding nomadism  a pivotal event in the history of Mongolia as it became the dominant lifestyle  Horse riding nomadism is first seen in Mongolia during the Copper and Bronze Age Afanasevo culture  3500 2500 BC  which stretched to the Khangai Mountains in Central Mongolia  The wheeled vehicles found in the burials of the Afanasevans have been dated to before 2200 BC  15  Pastoral nomadism and metalworking became more and more developed with the later Okunev Culture  2nd millennium BC   Andronovo culture  2300 1000 BC  and Karasuk culture  1500 300 BC   culminating with the Iron Age Xiongnu Empire in 209 BC  Monuments of the pre Xiongnu Bronze Age include deer stones  keregsur kurgans  square slab tombs and rock paintings  Although cultivation of crops has continued since the Neolithic it always remained small in scale compared to pastoral nomadism  which may have first been introduced from the west or arose independently in the region  The population during the Copper Age has been described as paleomongoloid in the east of what is now Mongolia  and as europoid in the west  14  Tocharians  Yuezhi  and Scythians inhabited western Mongolia during the Bronze Age  The mummy of a Scythian warrior  which is believed to be about 2 500 years old  was a 30 to 40 year old man with blond hair and was found in the Altai  Mongolia  16  As horse nomadism was introduced into Mongolia  the political center of the Eurasian Steppe also shifted to Mongolia  where it remained until the 18th century CE  The intrusions of northern pastoralists  e g  Guifang  Shanrong  Donghu  into China during the Shang dynasty  1600 1046 BC  and Zhou dynasty  1046 256 BC  presaged the age of nomadic empires  Mongolia  since prehistoric times  has been inhabited by nomads who  from time to time  formed great confederations that rose to prominence  The first of these  the Xiongnu of undetermined ethnicity  were brought together to form a confederation by Modu Shanyu in 209 BC  Soon they emerged as the greatest threat to the Qin Dynasty  forcing the latter to construct the Great Wall of China  itself being guarded by up to almost 300 000 soldiers during marshal Meng Tian s tenure  as a means of defense against the destructive Xiongnu raids  The vast Xiongnu empire  209 BC 93 AD  was followed by the Mongolic Xianbei empire  93 234  which also ruled more than the entirety of present day Mongolia  The Mongolic Rouran Khaganate  330 555   of Xianbei provenance  ruled a massive empire before being defeated by the G kt rks  555 745  whose empire was even bigger  laid siege to Panticapaeum  present day Kerch  in 576   They were succeeded by the Uyghur Khaganate  745 840  who were defeated by the Kyrgyz  The Mongolic Khitans  also descendants of the Xianbei  ruled Mongolia during the Liao Dynasty  907 1125  after which the Khamag Mongol  1125 1206  rose to prominence  Middle Ages to independence Main article  Mongol Empire This map shows the boundary of 13th century Mongol Empire compared to today s Mongols  In the chaos of the late 12th century  a chieftain named Tem jin finally succeeded in uniting the Mongol tribes  belonging to the Shiwei branch of the Mongolic Xianbei  between Manchuria and the Altai Mountains  In 1206  he took the title Genghis Khan  and waged a series of military campaigns   renowned for their brutality and ferocity   sweeping through much of Asia  and forming the Mongol Empire  the largest contiguous land empire in world history  Under his successors it stretched from present day Poland in the west to Korea in the east  and from Siberia in the north to the Gulf of Oman and Vietnam in the south  covering some 33 000 000 square kilometres  13 000 000 sq mi   17   22  of Earth s total land area  and having a population of over 100 million people  The emergence of Pax Mongolica also significantly eased trade and commerce across Asia during its height  18  19  After Genghis Khan s death  the empire was subdivided into four kingdoms or Khanates which eventually became quasi independent after M ngke s death in 1259  One of the khanates  the  Great Khaanate   consisting of the Mongol homeland and China  became the Yuan Dynasty under Kublai Khan  the grandson of Genghis Khan  He set up his capital in present day Beijing but after more than a century of power  the Yuan was replaced by the Ming Dynasty in 1368  with the Mongol court fleeing to the north  As the Ming armies pursued the Mongols into their homeland  they successfully sacked and destroyed the Mongol capital Karakorum among a few other cities  although some of these attempts were repelled by the Mongols under Ayushridar and his general K ke Tem r  Altan Khan  1507 1582  founded the city of Hohhot  helped introduce Buddhism and originated the title of Dalai Lama Castle built in northern Mongolia by Tsogt Taij in 1601  After the expulsion of the Yuan Dynasty rulers from China  the Mongols continued to rule Mongolia  also referred to as the Northern Yuan  The next centuries were marked by violent power struggles among various factions  notably the Genghisids and the non Genghisid Oirads  as well as by several Chinese invasions  like the five expeditions led by the Yongle Emperor   In the early 15th century  the Oirads under Esen Tayisi gained the upper hand  and even raided China in 1449 in a conflict over Esen s right to pay tribute  capturing the Ming emperor in the process  However  Esen was murdered in 1454  and the Borjigids recovered  Batum ngke Dayan Khan and his khatun Mandukhai reunited the entire Mongol nation under the Genghisids in the early 16th century  In the mid 16th century  Altan Khan of the T med  a grandson of Dayan Khan   but no legitimate Khan himself   became powerful  He founded Hohhot in 1557 and his meeting with the Dalai Lama in 1578 sparked the second introduction of Tibetan Buddhism to Mongolia  Abtai Khan of the Khalkha converted to Buddhism and founded the Erdene Zuu monastery in 1585  His grandson Zanabazar became the first Jebtsundamba Khutughtu in 1640  An image of an early 20th century Oirat caravan  traveling on horseback  possibly to trade goods  The last Mongol Khan was Ligden Khan in the early 17th century  He got into conflicts with the Manchus over the looting of Chinese cities  and managed to alienate most Mongol tribes  He died in 1634 on his way to Tibet  in an attempt to evade the Manchus and destroy the Yellow Hat sect of Buddhism  By 1636  most Inner Mongolian tribes had submitted to the Manchus  who founded the Qing Dynasty  The Khalkha eventually submitted to Qing rule in 1691  thus bringing all of today s Mongolia under Beijing s rule  After several wars  the Dzungars  the western Mongols or Oirats  were virtually annihilated during the Qing conquest of Dzungaria in 1757 58  20  Some scholars estimate that about 80  of the 600 000 or more Dzungars were destroyed by a combination of disease and warfare  21  Outer Mongolia was given relative autonomy  being administered by the hereditary Genghisid khanates of Tusheet Khan  Setsen Khan  Zasagt Khan and Sain Noyon Khan  The Jebtsundamba Khutuktu of Mongolia had immense de facto authority  The Manchus also forbade mass Chinese immigration  allowing the Mongols to keep their culture  Until 1911  Qing Dynasty maintained control of Mongolia with a series of alliances and intermarriages  as well as military and economic measures  Ambans  Manchu  high officials   were installed in Kh ree  Uliastai  and Khovd  and the country was subdivided into ever more feudal and ecclesiastical fiefdoms  Over the course of the 19th century  the feudal lords attached more importance to representation and less importance to the responsibilities towards their subjects  The behaviour of Mongolia s nobility  together with the usurious practices of the Chinese traders and the collection of imperial taxes in silver instead of animals  resulted in poverty becoming ever more rampant  Post independence The eighth Jebtsundamba Khutuktu With the fall of the Qing Dynasty  Mongolia under the Bogd Khaan declared independence in 1911  However  the newly established Republic of China considered Mongolia to be part of its own territory  The area controlled by the Bogd Khaan was approximately that of the former Outer Mongolia during the Qing period  In 1919  after the October Revolution in Russia  Chinese troops led by Xu Shuzheng occupied Mongolia  However  as a result of the Russian Civil War  the White Russian adventurer Baron Ungern led his troops into Mongolia in October 1920  defeating the Chinese forces in Niislel Kh ree  Ulaanbaatar  in early February 1921  In order to eliminate the threat posed by Ungern  Bolshevik Russia decided to support the establishment of a communist Mongolian government and army  This Mongolian army took the Mongolian part of Kyakhta from Chinese forces on March 18  1921  and on July 6 Russian and Mongolian troops arrived in Kh ree  Mongolia s independence was declared once again on July 11  1921  22  These events led to Mongolia s close alignment with the Soviet Union over the next seven decades  In 1924  after the death of the religious leader and king Bogd Khan  a Mongolian People s Republic was proclaimed with support from the Soviet Union  Damdin S khbaatar  ca 1920 1922 In 1928  Khorloogiin Choibalsan rose to power  He instituted collectivisation of livestock  the destruction of Buddhist monasteries and the Mongolia s enemies of the people persecution resulting in the murder of monks and other people  In Mongolia during the 1920s  approximately one third of the male population were monks  By the beginning of the 20th century  about 750 monasteries were functioning in Mongolia  23  The Stalinist purges in Mongolia that began in 1937 affected the Republic by killing more than 30 000 people  Japanese imperialism became even more alarming after the invasion of neighboring Manchuria in 1931  During the Soviet Japanese Border War of 1939  the Soviet Union successfully defended Mongolia against Japanese expansionism  In August 1945 Mongolian forces also took part in the Soviet Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation in Inner Mongolia  The Soviet threat of seizing parts of Inner Mongolia citation needed  induced China to recognize Outer Mongolia s independence  provided that a referendum be held  The referendum took place on October 20  1945  with  according to official numbers  100  of the electorate voting for independence  citation needed  After the establishment of the People s Republic of China  both countries confirmed their mutual recognition on October 6  1949  On January 26  1952  Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal took power  In 1956 and again in 1962  Choibalsan s personality cult was condemned at the ruling Mongolian People s Revolutionary Party Central Committee plenums  Mongolia continued to align itself closely with the Soviet Union  especially after the Sino Soviet split of the late 1950s  In the 1980s  an estimated 55 000 Soviet troops were based in Mongolia  While Tsedenbal was visiting Moscow in August 1984  his severe illness prompted the parliament to announce his retirement and replace him with Jambyn Batm nkh  The introduction of perestroika and glasnost in the USSR by Mikhail Gorbachev strongly influenced Mongolian politics  leading to the peaceful Democratic Revolution and the introduction of a multi party system and market economy  A new constitution was introduced in 1992  and the  People s Republic  was dropped from the country s name  The transition to market economy was often rocky  The early 1990s saw high inflation and food shortages  The first election wins for non communist parties came in 1993  presidential elections  and 1996  parliamentary elections   The signing of the Oyu Tolgoi mine contract is considered a major milestone in modern Mongolian history  The Mongolian People s Revolutionary Party renamed itself the Mongolian People s Party in 2010  Politics Main article  Politics of Mongolia Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj  current President of Mongolia  Mongolia is a parliamentary

dominant party in two other coalitions  Both changes of government after 2004 were initiated by the MPRP  The DP was the dominant force in the ruling coalition between 1996 and 2000  and also an approximately equal partner with the MPRP in the 2004 2006 coalition  The MPRP won the last round of parliamentary elections  held in June 2008  The President of Mongolia has a largely symbolic role  but can block the Parliament s decisions  The parliament  in response  can then overrule the veto by a two thirds majority vote  Mongolia s constitution provides three requirements for taking office

Gobi Desert  while the northern and western portions are mountainous  Bactrian camels by sand dunes in Gobi Desert  At 1 564 116 km2  603 909 sq mi   30  Mongolia is the world s 19th largest country  after Iran   It is significantly larger than the next largest country  Peru  It mostly lies between latitudes 41  and 52 N  a small area is north of 52    and longitudes 87  and 120 E  The geography of Mongolia is varied  with the Gobi Desert to the south and with cold and mountainous regions to the north and west  Much of Mongolia consists of steppes  The highest point in Mongolia is the Kh iten Peak in the Tavan bogd massif in the far west at 4 374 m  14 350 ft   The basin of the Uvs Lake  shared with Tuva Republic in Russia  is a natural World Heritage Site  Most of the country is hot in the summer and extremely cold in the winter  with January averages dropping as low as  30  C   22  F   31  The country is also subject to occasional harsh climatic conditions known as zud  The annual average temperature in Ulan Bator is 0 C  making it the world s coldest capital city  31  Mongolia is high  cold  and windy  It has an extreme continental climate with long  cold winters and short summers  during which most of its annual precipitation falls  The country averages 257 cloudless days a year  and it is usually at the center of a region of high atmospheric pressure  Precipitation is highest in the north  average of 200 to 350 millimeters  7 9 to 13 8 in  per year  and lowest in the south  which receives 100 to 200 millimeters  3 9 to 7 9 in  annually  The highest annual precipitation of 622 297mm occurred in the forests of Bulgan Province close to the border with Russia and the lowest of 41 735mm occurred in the Gobi Desert  period 1961 1990   32  The sparsely populated far north of Bulgan Province averages 600mm in annual precipitation which means it receives more precipitation than Beijing  571 8mm  or Berlin  571mm   The name  Gobi  is a Mongol term for a desert steppe  which usually refers to a category of arid rangeland with insufficient vegetation to support marmots but with enough to support camels  Mongols distinguish Gobi from desert proper  although the distinction is not always apparent to outsiders unfamiliar with the Mongolian landscape  Gobi rangelands are fragile and are easily destroyed by overgrazing  which results in expansion of the true desert  a stony waste where not even Bactrian camels can survive  Economy Main article  Economy of Mongolia Capital Ulan Bator is the hub of most domestic and international trade and relations Economic activity in Mongolia has traditionally been based on herding and agriculture  although development of extensive mineral deposits of copper  coal  molybdenum  tin  tungsten  and gold have emerged as a driver of industrial production  33  Besides mining  21 8  of GDP  and agriculture  16  of GDP   dominant industries in the composition of GDP are wholesale and retail trade and service  transportation and storage  and real estate activities  33  The grey economy is estimated to be at least one third the size of the official economy  33  As of 2006  68 4  of Mongolia s exports went to the PRC  and the PRC supplied 29 8  of Mongolia s imports  34  Mongolia is ranked as lower middle income economy by the World Bank  35  22 4  of the population lives on less than US  1 25 a day  8  GDP per capita in 2011 was  3 100  12  Despite growth  the proportion of the population below the poverty line was estimated to be 35 6  in 1998  36 1  in 2002 2003  32 2  in 2006  36  Because of a boom in the mining sector  Mongolia had high growth rates in 2007 and 2008  9 9  and 8 9   respectively   33  In 2009  sharp drops in commodity prices and the effects of the global financial crisis caused the local currency to drop 40  against the U S  dollar  Two of the 16 commercial banks were taken into receivership  33  GDP growth in 2011 was expected to reach 16 4   However  inflation continued to erode GDP gains  with an average rate of 12 6  expected in Mongolia at the end of 2011  33  Although GDP has risen steadily since 2002 at the rate of 7 5  in an official 2006 estimate  the state is still working to overcome a sizable trade deficit  The Economist expects this trade deficit of 14  of Mongolia s GDP to transform into a surplus in 2013  37  Mongolia was never listed among the Emerging markets countries until February 2011 when Citigroup analysts determined Mongolia to be one of Global Growth Generators countries which being countries with the most promising growth prospects for 2010 2050  38  The Mongolian Stock Exchange  established in 1991 in Ulan Bator  is among the world s smallest stock exchanges by market capitalisation  39  40  In 2011  it had 336 companies listed with a total market capitalization of US 2 billion after quadrupling from US 406 million in 2008  41  Mineral industry Oyu Tolgoi employs 18 000 workers and will be producing 450 000 tonnes of copper a year by 2020 42  Minerals represent more than 80  of Mongolia s exports  a proportion expected to eventually rise to 95   37  About 3 000 mining licences have been issued  37  Mining is continuing to rise as a major industry of Mongolia as evidenced by number of Chinese  Russian and Canadian firms opening and starting mining business in Mongolia  12  In summer 2009 the government negotiated an  Investment Agreement  with Rio Tinto and Ivanhoe Mines to develop the Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold deposit  33  the biggest foreign investment project in Mongolia  expected to account for one third of Mongolia s GDP by 2020  37  In March 2011  six big mining companies prepared to bid for the Tavan Tolgoi area  the world s largest untapped coal deposit  According

from breeding lifestock  44  Most herders in Mongolia follow a pattern of nomadic or semi nomadic pastoralism  Due to the severe 2009 2010 winter  Mongolia lost 9 7 million animals  or 22  of total livestock  This immediately affected meat prices  which increased twofold  GDP dropped 1 6  in 2009  33  Transportation Train in Zamyn   d station in Dornogovi aimag Main article  Transportation in Mongolia The Trans Mongolian Railway is the main rail link between Mongolia and its neighbors  It begins at the Trans Siberian Railway in Russia at the town of Ulan Ude  crosses into Mongolia  runs through Ulaanbaatar  then passes into China at Erenhot where it joins the Chinese railway system  A separate railroad link connects the eastern city of Choibalsan with the Trans Siberian Railway  However  that link is closed to passengers after the Mongolian town of Chuluunkhoroot  45  Mongolia has a number of domestic airports  The only international airport is the Chinggis Khaan International Airport near Ulaanbaatar  Direct flight connections exist between Mongolia and South Korea  China  Japan  Russia and Germany  MIAT is Mongolia s largest carrier  Many overland roads in Mongolia are only gravel roads or simple cross country tracks  There are paved roads from Ulaanbaatar to the Russian and Chinese border  from Ulaanbaatar east  and westward  the so called Millenium Road   and from Darkhan to Bulgan  A number of road construction projects are currently underway  Demographics Main article  Demographics of Mongolia Apartment complexes in Bayangol district in Ulaanbaatar In settlements  many families live in ger quarters Mongolia s total population as of July 2007 is estimated by U S  Census Bureau 46  at 2 951 786 people  ranking at around 138th in the world in terms of population  But the U S  Department of State Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs uses the U N  estimations 47  instead of the U S  Census Bureau estimations  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division 48  estimates Mongolia s total population  mid 2007  as 2 629 000  11  less than the U S  Census Bureau figure   UN estimates resemble those made by the Mongolian National Statistical Office  2 612 900  end of June 2007   Mongolia s population growth rate is estimated at 1 2   2007 est    48  About 59  of the total population is under age 30  27  of whom are under 14  This relatively young and growing population has placed strains on Mongolia s economy  Since the end of socialism  Mongolia has experienced a decline of total fertility rate  children per woman  that is steeper than in any other country in the world  according to recent UN estimations  48  in 1970 1975  fertility was estimated to be 7 33 children per woman  but 2005 2010 prospects are 1 87  4 times less   Ethnic Mongols account for about 95  of the population and consist of Khalkha and other groups  all distinguished primarily by dialects of the Mongol language  The Khalkha make up 86  of the ethnic Mongol population  The remaining 14  include Oirats  Buryats and others  Turkic peoples  Kazakhs  Tuvans  and Chantuu  Uzbek  constitute 4 5  of Mongolia s population  and the rest are Russian  Chinese  Korean and American nationalities  49  Languages The official language of Mongolia is Mongolian  and is spoken by 95  of the population  A variety of dialects of Oirat and Buryat are spoken across the country  and there are also some speakers of Mongolic Khamnigan  In the west of the country  Kazakh and Tuvan  both Turkic languages  are also spoken  Today  Mongolian is written using the Cyrillic alphabet  although in the past it was written using the Mongolian script  An official reintroduction of the old script was planned for 1994  but has not yet taken place as older generations encountered practical difficulties   50  The traditional alphabet is being slowly reintroduced through schools   51  The Russian language is the most frequently spoken foreign language in Mongolia  followed by English  though English has been gradually replacing Russian as the second language  citation needed Korean has gained popularity as tens of thousands of Mongolians work in South Korea  52  Interest in Chinese  as the language of the other neighbouring power  has been growing  citation needed Japanese is also popular among the younger people  A number of older educated Mongolians speak some German  as they studied in the former East Germany  while a few speak other languages from the former Eastern Bloc  Besides that  many younger Mongolians are fluent in the Western European languages as they study or work in foreign countries including Germany  France and Italy  Deaf people in Mongolia use Mongolian Sign Language  Religion

have been widely practiced throughout the history of what is now modern day Mongolia  as such beliefs were common among nomadic people in Asian history  Such beliefs gradually gave way to Tibetan Buddhism  but shamanism has left a mark on Mongolian religious culture  and it continues to be practiced  The Kazakhs of western Mongolia traditionally practice Islam  Throughout much of the 20th century  the communist government ensured that the religious practices of the Mongolian people were largely repressed  citation needed  It targeted the clergy of the Mongolian Tibetan Buddhist Church  which had been tightly intertwined with the previous feudal government structures  e g  from 1911 on  the head of the Church had also been the khan of the country   54  In the late 1930s  the regime  then led by Khorloogiin Choibalsan  closed almost all of Mongolia s over 700 Buddhist monasteries and killed at least 18 000 lamas  55  The number of Buddhist monks dropped from 100 000 in 1924 to 110 in 1990  54  The fall of communism in 1991 restored the legality of public religious practice  and Tibetan Buddhism  which had been the predominant religion in the region before the rise of communism  again rose to become the most widely practiced religion in Mongolia  The end of religious repression in the 1990s also allowed for other religions  such as Baha i Faith and Christianity  to spread in the country  According to the Christian missionary group Barnabas Fund  the number of Christians grew from just four in 1989 to around 40 000 as of 2008  56  Culture Main article  Culture of Mongolia Riders during Naadam festival Naadam is the largest summer celebration The main festival is Naadam  which has been organised for centuries  consists of three Mongolian traditional sports  archery  horse racing  over long stretches of open country  not the short racing around a track practiced in the West   and wrestling  Nowadays it is held on July 11 to July 13 in the honour of the anniversaries of the National Democratic Revolution and foundation of the Great Mongol State  Another very popular activity called Shagaa is the  flicking  of sheep ankle bones at a target several feet away  using a flicking motion of the finger to send the small bone flying at targets and trying to knock the target bones off the platform  This contest at Naadam is very popular and develops a serious audience among older Mongolians  In Mongolia  the khoomei  or throat singing   style of music is popular  particularly in parts of Western Mongolia  The ornate symbol in the leftmost bar of the national flag is a Buddhist icon called Soyombo  It represents the sun  moon  stars  and heavens per standard cosmological symbology abstracted from that seen in traditional thangka paintings  Sports Mongolia s Naadam festival takes place over three days in the summer and includes horse racing  archery  and Mongolian wrestling  These three sports  traditionally recognized as the three primary masculine activities  are the most widely watched and practiced sports throughout the country  Horse riding is especially central to Mongolian culture  The long distance races that are showcased during Naadam festivals are one aspect of this  as is the popularity of trick riding  One example of trick riding is the legend that the Mongolian military hero Damdin S khbaatar scattered coins on the ground and then picked them up while riding a horse at full gallop  Other sports such as table tennis  basketball  and association football are increasingly getting popular  More Mongolian table tennis players are competing internationally  B khiin  rg    main arena of the Mongolian wrestling in Ulaanbaatar Mongolian wrestling is a common sport Wrestling is the most popular of all Mongol sports  It is the highlight of the Three Manly Games of Naadam  Historians claim that Mongol style wrestling originated some seven thousand years ago  Hundreds of wrestlers from different cities and aimags around the country take part in the national wrestling competition  There are no weight categories or age limits  Each wrestler has his own attendant herald  The aim of the sport is to knock one s opponent off balance and throw him down  making him touch the ground with his elbow and knee  The winners are honored with ancient titles  the winner of the fifth round gets the honorary title of nachin  falcon   of the seventh and eighth rounds zaan  elephant   and of the tenth and eleventh rounds arslan  lion   The wrestler who becomes the absolute champion is awarded the title of avarga  Titan   Every subsequent victory at the national Naadam festival will add an epithet to the avarga title  like  Invincible Titan to be remembered by all   Beginning in 2003  the Mongolian parliament adopted a new law on Naadam  making amendments to some of the wrestling titles  The titles of iarudi and Khartsaga  Hawk  were added to the existing above mentioned rules  The traditional wrestling costume includes an open fronted jacket  tied around the waist with a string  This is said to have come into use after the champion of a wrestling competition many years ago was discovered to be a woman  The jacket was introduced to ensure that only men could compete  Mongolia s traditional wrestlers have made the transition to Japanese sumo wrestling with great success  Asash ry  Akinori was the first Mongolian to be promoted to the top sumo rank of yokozuna in 2003 and was followed by his countryman Hakuh  Sh  in 2007  Naidangiin T vshinbayar won Mongolia s first ever Olympic gold medal in the men s 100 kilogram class of judo  57  Association football is also played in Mongolia  The Mongolia national football team began playing again in the 1990s  it has yet to qualify for a major tournament  The Mongolia Premier League is the top domestic competition  Several Mongolian women have excelled in pistol shooting  Otryadyn G ndegmaa is a silver medalist of the 2008 Olympic Games  Munkhbayar Dorjsuren is a double world champion and Olympic bronze medal winner  now representing Germany   while Tsogbadrakhyn M nkhzul is  as of May 2007  ranked third in the world in the 25 m Pistol event  58  Architecture Main article  Architecture of Mongolia A ger in front of the Gurvan Saikhan Mountains Gandantegchinlen Khiid Monastery has many Buddhist architecture temples Ulaanbaatar Opera House The traditional Mongolian dwelling is known as a ger  In the past it was known by the Russian term yurt  but this is changing as the Mongolian term becomes better known among English speaking countries  According to Mongolian artist and art critic N  Chultem  the ger was the basis for development of traditional Mongolian architecture  In the 16th and 17th centuries  lamaseries were built throughout the country  Many of them started as ger temples  When they needed to be enlarged to accommodate the growing number of worshippers  the Mongolian architects used structures with 6 and 12 angles clarification needed  with pyramidal roofs to approximate to the round shape of a ger  Further enlargement led to a quadratic shape of the temples  The roofs were made in the shape of marquees  59  The trellis walls  roof poles and layers of felt were replaced by stone  brick  beams and planks  and became permanent  60  Chultem distinguished three styles in traditional Mongolian architecture  Mongolian  Tibetan and Chinese as well as combinations of the three  Among the first quadratic temples was Batu Tsagaan  1654  designed by Zanabazar  An example of the ger style architecture is the lamasery Dashi Choiling in Ulaanbaatar  The temple Lavrin  18th century  in the Erdene Zuu lamasery was built in the Tibetan tradition  An example of a temple built in the Chinese tradition is the lamasery Choijing Lamiin Sume  1904   which is a museum today  The quadratic temple Tsogchin in lamasery Gandan in Ulan Bator is a combination of the Mongolian and Chinese tradition  The temple of Maitreya  disassembled in 1938  is an example of the Tibeto Mongolian architecture  59  Dashi Choiling monastery has commenced a project to restore the temple and the 80 feet  24 m  sculpture of Maitreya  Music Main article  Music of Mongolia Musician playing the traditional Mongolian musical instrument morin khuur The music of Mongolia is strongly influenced by nature  nomadism  shamanism  and also Tibetan Buddhism  The traditional music includes a variety of instruments  famously the morin khuur  and also the singing styles like the urtyn duu   long song    and throat singing  khoomei   The  tsam  is danced to keep away evil spirits and it was seen the reminiscences of shamaning  The first rock band of Mongolia was Soyol Erdene  founded in the 1960s  Their Beatles like manner was severely criticized by the Communist censorship  It was followed by Mungunhurhree  Ineemseglel  Urgoo  etc   carving out the path for the genre in the harsh environment of Communist ideology  Mungunhurhree and Haranga were to become the pioneers in the Mongolia s heavy rock music  Haranga approached its zenith in the late 1980s and 1990s  The leader of Haranga  famous guitarist Enh Manlai  generously helped the growth of the following generations of rockers  Among the followers of Haranga was the band Hurd  In the early 1990s  group Har Chono put the beginning for Mongolia s folk rock  merging elements of the Mongolian traditional  long song  into the genre  By that time  the environment for development of artistic thought had become largely liberal thanks to the new democratic society in the country  The 1990s saw development of rap  techno  hip hop and also boy bands and girl bands flourish at the turn of the millennium  Media Main article  Media of Mongolia Mongolian media interviewing the opposition Mongolian Green Party  The media has gained significant freedoms since democratic reforms initiated in the 1990s  Mongolian press began in 1920 with close ties to the Soviet Union under the Mongolian Communist Party  with the establishment of the Unen   Truth   newspaper similar to the Soviet Pravda  61  Until reforms in the 1990s  the government had strict control of the media and oversaw all publishing  in which no independent media was allowed  61  The dissolution of the Soviet Union had a significant impact on Mongolia  where the one party state grew into a multi party democracy  and with that  media freedoms came to the forefront  A new law on press freedom  drafted with help from international NGOs on August 28  1998 and enacted on January 1  1999  paved the way for media reforms  62  The Mongolian media currently consists of around 300 print and broadcasting outlets  63  Since 2006  the media environment has been improving with the government debating a new Freedom of Information Act  and the removal of any affiliation of media outlets with the government  64  65  Market reforms have led to an increasing number of people working in the media year on year  along with students at journalism schools  64  In its 2008 report  Reporters Without Borders classified the media environment as 93rd out of 173  with 1st being most free  66  Education The National University of Mongolia in Ulan Bator During the state socialist period  education was one of the areas of significant achievement in Mongolia  Illiteracy was virtually eliminated  in part through the use of seasonal boarding schools for children of nomadic families  Funding to these boarding schools was cut in the 1990s  contributing to slightly increased illiteracy  Primary and secondary education formerly lasted 10 years  but was expanded to 11 years  Since the 2008 2009 school year  new first graders are using the 12 year system  As such  full transition to the 12 year system will not happen until the 2019 2020 school year  when the current third graders graduate  67  Mongolian national universities are all spin offs from the National University of Mongolia and the Mongolian University of Science and Technology  The broad liberalization of the 1990s led to a boom in private institutions of higher education  although many of these establishments have difficulty living up to their name of  college  or  university   citation needed  Health Since 1990  key health indicators like life expectancy and infant and child mortality have steadily improved  both due to social changes and to improvement in the health sector  However  serious problems remain  especially in the countryside  68  Average childbirth  fertility rate  is around 2 25 46    1 87 48  per woman  2007  and average life expectancy is 68 5 years  2011   8  Infant mortality is at 1 9  69  4  70  and child mortality is at 4 3   71  The health sector comprises 17 specialized hospitals and centers  4 regional diagnostic and treatment centers  9 district and 21 aimag general hospitals  323 soum hospitals  18 feldsher posts  233 family group practices  and 536 private hospitals and 57 drug supply companies pharmacies  In 2002 the total number of health workers was 33 273  of which 6823 were doctors  788 pharmacists  7802 nurses  and 14 091 mid level personnel  At present  there are 27 7 physicians and 75 7 hospital beds per 10 000 inhabitants  See also Central Asia portal Mongolia portal Book  Mongolia Wikipedia books
