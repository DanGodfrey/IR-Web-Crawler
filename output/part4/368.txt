New Mutants From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search This article may contain minor or trivial fictional references  Mere trivia  or references unimportant to the overall plot of a work of fiction  should be deleted  See also what Wikipedia is not   August 2011  The New Mutants are a group of teenaged mutant superheroes in training published by Marvel Comics  They have been the main characters of three successive comic book series  which were spin offs of the popular X Men franchise  The first team of New Mutants characters was created by Chris Claremont  long time writer of Uncanny X Men  and artist Bob McLeod  although the concept for a  X Men in training team  was originated by Uncanny X Men artist John Byrne in a letter he wrote to Claremont in 1978  1  They first appeared in 1982 s Marvel Graphic Novel  4 and were subsequently featured in their own title from 1983 until 1991  Also  like its parent title  The New Mutants highlighted interpersonal and group conflict as well as action and adventure  and featured a large ensemble cast  With the end of the first series  the characters were relaunched as X Force in a new  eponymous series  The second New Mutants series  launched in 2003  featured a new group of teenage mutants  but unlike the original New Mutants  they were only part of a huge cast of students at the Xavier Institute  At first  they were notable for their drive to become superheroes  but soon rival internal groups played a large role in the series  In 2004  it was relaunched as New X Men  Academy X  after which the central group was formally dubbed the  New Mutants   In the aftermath of the  M Day  crossover storyline in late 2005  the remaining students were merged into one junior team  the New X Men  The third New Mutants series  reuniting most of the original team  launched in May 2009  Contents 1 The New Mutants  vol  1 1 1 Collected editions 2 The New Mutants  vol  2 2 1 Collected editions 3 New Mutants  vol

under the authorship of Chris Claremont  had become one of the comic book industry s most successful titles  prompting Marvel to launch The New Mutants  the first of several X Men spin offs  The New Mutants were teenaged students of Professor Charles Xavier  much like the original X Men  who had since grown into adulthood  These students  however  rather resembled the  All New  All Different X Men  in terms of ethnic diversity  The original team consisted of  Karma  Xi an Coy Manh   a 19 year old Vietnamese girl and the team s original leader  who could mentally possess other people s bodies  Cannonball  Samuel Guthrie   a mild mannered Kentuckian and eventual co leader after Karma s  death   who became nigh invulnerable when rocketing through the air  Wolfsbane  Rahne Sinclair   a Scot who could transform into a wolf like creature  Psyche  Danielle Moonstar  also called Mirage and Moonstar   a Cheyenne and eventual co leader after Karma s  death   who could create visual empathic three dimensional illusions  Sunspot  Roberto da Costa   a Brazilian who gained superhuman strength fueled by sunlight and could store solar energy in his body to use his super strength during the night  The team debuted in Marvel Graphic Novel  4  December 1982   which continued a plotline from Uncanny X Men  The group was formed by Professor X when he was under the control of the menacing alien race called the Brood  The youths were intended to be hosts for Brood embryos  but the X Men returned and set matters straight  The five youngsters remained at Xavier s School for Gifted Youngsters to learn to control their powers  The series was originally written by Claremont and illustrated by McLeod  the team s co creators  but McLeod soon passed artistic duties on to Sal Buscema  Claremont gave the series an oddly dark tone  which was heightened with the arrival of artist Bill Sienkiewicz  In addition to very serious depictions of teenage angst and growing pains  the series featured themes of mysticism and psychic boundaries  The New Mutants also encountered a secret society called the Hellfire Club  and began a rivalry with their young apprentices  the Hellions  The New Mutants initially had a semi antagonistic relationship with the youngest X Man  Kitty Pryde  sparked by Professor X s decision to  demote  Kitty to the junior team after its establishment  Though Kitty ultimately proved herself to Xavier and remained an X Man  she held a grudge against the New Mutants nonetheless  dubbing them  X Babies   The New Mutants  blameless in Xavier s decision and resenting Kitty s attitude  responded in kind  The animosity softened after the team attempted to rescue Kitty from the Hellfire Club s White Queen Emma Frost  and furthermore after Kitty s friends Illyana Rasputin and Doug Ramsey joined the team  see below   After the apparent death of Karma  Cannonball and Dani Moonstar were appointed co leaders  New recruits included  Magma  Amara Aquila Alison Crestmere   a fiercely tempered native of a secret Roman society in the Amazon who could control lava  Magik  Illyana Rasputin   sister of the Russian X Man Colossus and long time resident of the X Mansion  an accomplished mystic who could open  teleportation discs  allowing travel to Limbo and from there  any point on Earth  Warlock  an extraterrestrial of the techno organic race known as the Technarchy  Cypher  Douglas Ramsey   an otherwise ordinary young man who could learn any language  spoken or written  at an exponential rate  whether it was human  alien  or machine  making him an unmatched computer expert  In 1986  Professor X was written out of the series  Before he left  he made the X Men s one time nemesis  Magneto  headmaster of his school  Not trusted by his students  Magneto struggled in his new role and eventually joined the Hellfire Club  In 1987  the series was turned over to writer Louise Simonson and illustrator Bret Blevins  Simonson s run was controversial  citation needed  as Magma was written out of the book  Cypher was killed off  new characters Bird Brain and Gosamyr were added to the team  and Magik was de aged back to childhood  Simonson also folded the X Terminators  a group of young wards from X Factor  into the New Mutants  The X Terminators added to the team were  Rictor  Julio Richter   a young Mexican who could create shock waves  Rusty Collins  a pyrokinetic wanted by the U S  government  Skids  Sally Blevins   a former Morlock who could project a force field around her body  Boom Boom  Tabitha Smith   a teen runaway who could create  plasma bombs   In 1989  Simonson crafted a saga in which the team journeyed to Asgard  the home of the gods of Norse mythology  The storyline wrote Dani Moonstar out of the series  as she joined the Norse pantheon as one of the Valkyrie  Sales of the series had slumped for several years  but took a sharp upturn after Rob Liefeld took over the penciling and co plotting chores at the end of 1989  citation needed  A new mentor for the group  the mysterious mercenary Cable  was introduced  further helping sales  Over the next year  several longtime team members were written out or killed off  When Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza  who wrote dialogue based on Liefeld s plots  took over as writers of the final three issues of the series  they included several harder edged characters  Domino  Cable s pale skinned  black garbed mercenary lover  Shatterstar  a swashbuckling warrior from another dimension  Warpath  James Proudstar   the younger brother of slain X Man Thunderbird and a former Hellion  an Apache who possessed super strength and speed  Feral  Maria Callasantos   who possessed a bestial temperament and appearance  The New Mutants was cancelled in 1991 with issue  100  but the new platoon like team formed by Cable continued in X Force  a successful series  whose first issue sold approximately one million copies  citation needed  that would continue until 2002  and feature a variety of the former New Mutants cast   edit  Collected editions The New Mutants has been reprinted in several trade paperbacks  some containing specific story arcs  such as the  Demon Bear Saga  by Claremont and Sienkiewicz   and some collected as part of a larger crossover of the various X titles  Only in 2006  however  did a chronological reprinting of the series begin

CypherMagmaMoonstar  leader SunspotWarlockX ManFormer Members CannonballKarmaMagik In May 2009  a third volume of New Mutants was launched  The series is written by Zeb Wells and pencilled by Diogenes Neves with many original characters returning to form a new field team for the X Men  The team is a reunion of sorts for the original cast from the first volume and consists of Cannonball  Dani Moonstar  Magma  Sunspot  Karma  and Magik  and spun from events from the limited series X Infernus   edit  The Return of Legion The series opens with Shan and Dani investigating the possible case of a mutant in Westcliffe  Colorado  Shan meets a little girl and they are both in trouble as an axe comes through a door behind them while a hand turns the doorknob  Meanwhile at the X Men s new HQ Magik returns  battle scarred  from the future and is met with hostility by the mutants that she dealt with in Limbo during the Quest For Magik storyline  Cannonball and Sunspot step in to defend her while Magik subsequently faints  muttering   They ll be almost dead by now   In the X Brig  Magma brings soup to the recently blinded Empath of the Hellions  They begin to talk when Sam calls Amara to the Med Bay due to the return of Illyana  Beast checks her out while the remaining former New Mutants discuss whether or not it is her due to her acting strange  Roberto then explains that both Beast and Cerebra say she is the real Illyana  Sam requests to create a new team consisting of himself  Amara  Roberto  and Illyana to find Dani and Shan as Magik believes they are in trouble  They get their uniforms and a jet and begin to travel to Westcliffe  Magik s strange behavior continues when she tells Amara that she knows Shan and Dani are in trouble because a year later Amara told her and blamed her for not being here to help  which was the reason Magik traveled back  Magik also questions whether Amara still loves Empath and even offers to reverse the blinding done to him by Pixie  She then believes that Amara prefers Empath to be helpless and offers to reverse it and keep it their secret  Upon arriving in Westcliffe  Magik sees a picture of the girl Shan was with earlier on a missing poster  This has a bad effect on Magik as she likens it to when she was abducted by the demon Belasco  Magik and Amara go to speak with the girl s parents while Sam and Roberto go to a bar  They are met with a less than warm welcome and eventually get into a fight  They then find Shan tied to a chair in the back room of the bar looking catatonic  Meanwhile  Magik and Amara go to the house of the parents of the girl  Marci  There Magik figures out clues the future Amara had given her and they know they are in the right place  They are met with resistance by the parents but eventually get to the basement where Marci is being kept  In the basement is a large box  Magik and Amara hear Shan s voice from the box  which they report back to Sam who does not understand as he was looking at Shan tied to the chair  Amara and Magik open the box and out walks David Haller  the mutant known as Legion  It is revealed that Shan and Marci are trapped in Haller s mind  They are chased by his many personalities through the mindscape  Roberto approaches Shan in the back room of the bar and is nearly sucked into Haller s mind until Sam punches him away  Shan hides Marci in an attic and is attacked and captured by the personalities  Marci takes control of Legion s body and communicates with her parents who try to protect her from Amara and Magik  While her parents argue about whether or not her father called the X Men  Marci is set upon by the personalities  One personality with what seems to be super strength takes the doll  which dictates who is in control of Legion s body  and punches Amara  Another takes the doll and uses an energy discharge to blast Magik through the roof of the house  Marci s mother still thinks that she is Legion  Marci s father knows otherwise and tries to stop her going to Legion  Another personality takes hold and punches through both of Marci s parents  Her father subsequently reveals he did call the X Men to his dying wife  Magma and Amara recover while Legion flies to find Dani because she is a Fixer  someone who helped fix David s mind previously  Sam interrogates the bartender and learns that Dani is in the local jail  They are subsequently found by the police outside the bar  Sam picks up Roberto and blasts by them  Legion then enters the jail and kills the officer on duty  Legion threatens Dani saying they have many ways to kill her  to which she replies that she has a few herself from behind the jail cell bars  The personality known as Jack Wayne speaks with Dani and tells her that more personalities have emerged and insults her loss of powers  He even goes so far as to toy with the idea of raping Dani until Roberto and Sam blast through the wall of the prison  kicking Legion through a wall  A quick exchange between Dani and Sam occurs  ending in Sam leaving Dani in the jail cell for her own protection  angering her greatly  The doll is handed to a new personality named Sally  whose powers seem to allow Legion s body to become incredibly muscled  Legion suddenly shouts   Nobody loves me   causing Bobby to pause and nearly get injured until Sam blasts onto the scene and punches Legion  Yet another personality who has a prehensile tongue  Hugh Davidson  takes over  He begins choking Bobby until Sam saves him  A  good  personality takes over and distracts Sam and Bobby while another Legion forms in Dani s cell and tries to kill her  The one in control is actually sad to do this and even apologizes as it prepares to kill Dani  This newly formed other Legion has its head melted by Magma as she and Magik arrive to save Dani  Sam and Bobby then blast through the cell doors  not realizing the other two had arrived  After Sam powers down  Dani punches him after he apologizes for leaving her there  She then walks out saying she is going to make herself  useful   As she is gone  there is a quick sit rep among the team ending in Magik leaving to go to the bar where Karma s body is  Sam worries about Legion coming after Dani again just before she returns armed with guns saying that they need to chase Legion  Illyana is warned not to kill any of David s personalities as she touches Karma s body and is dragged into Legion s mind  She arrives  takes out the Soulsword  and demands to see Shan  Jack Wayne taunts her  saying she will not kill any of them because she was told not to  Magik then proceeds to kill 3 personalities  including Jack Wayne  The main team gets ready to fight Legion and Dani is told to leave by Sam  They get into an argument where Sam calls Dani s lack of power into the argument  Dani gets into a van and drives off  Due to the powers of one of the personalities  Legion sees Dani driving away  In the mindscape  Magik again demands to be brought to Shan  One personality attempts to attack her as they  are many   Magik kills him and says   You are many  I have many ways to kill you   The other personalities then become more helpful  In the real world  Legion attacks the team with super speed and uses scrap metal to cut Roberto across the stomach  Magma then traps him with lava  In the mindscape  Magik finds Shan protecting Marci in a pseudo jail  Marci then leads them to where the real David Haller personality is  A new personality takes over  causing Magma s powers to shut down  Sam then punches him through a wall  Karma and Magik find David in another one of the cells  He is sad to find out that he has been bad again  Marci then tells David that the bad men took her doll Moira  this is a reference to the fact that he was in the care of Moira MacTaggert before  Magik exits the cell and demands the doll  The doll passes into the possession of someone who can turn off Sam s powers  causing him to hit into a car and get knocked out  The doll is handed to a personality who can heal Legion s injured body  Legion s body becomes that of a werewolf which goes to bite Sam before Dani drives the van she drove off in into him  He survives  and a brief fight ensues until Illyana takes the doll and thus control of Legion s body  Later the X Men arrive where Emma Frost puts the people of Westcliffe under the impression that they were all sick with the flu for the past 2 days  Madison Jeffries then puts a helmet on Legion in order to keep the peace inside his head  Sam thanks Dani for saving him  but she walks away without saying a word  Sam then has a conversation with Scott Summers about being a leader  The next issue deals with the aftermath of the case in Westcliffe  Utopia  and the return of Warlock  H A M M E R agents fire two missiles on Warlock but they do not explode  after Warlock has touched them  they are given sentience and they do not want to blow up  The comic then cuts to Utopia where Dani is brushing Brightwind  the horse she uses when she has her Valkyrie powers she received from Hela during the Utopia storyline in order to defeat Ares  Cyclops then offers her a teaching job  revealing that Sam has not put her on his team  The rest of the team are then being debriefed by Kavita Rao in relation to the Westcliffe mission  Shan worries about Marci being trapped in Haller s mind with all the others  The comic then shows the inside of Haller s mind now with all the different personalities being separately boxed by the X Club and Rogue  Roberto then tries to hit on Rogue while the X Club explains what s being done and how Legion got so many new powers and personalities  Roberto  Amara and Sam leave the lab and pass the danger room as they leave  The doors to the danger room slowly open to reveal Dani who promptly shouts   Guthrie   Shan explains to Dr  Rao how they got out of Haller s mind  and reveals that the only way someone could become part of Haller s mind was either through Shan s powers or if Legion is next to the person when they die  The comic then cuts to Sam and Dani in the danger room  while Sam wants to talk  Dani wants to spar  She punches him in the face and they begin to argue about why she is not on the team  she asks Sam what he would do if someone told him he could not die for one of the team  Sam replies   I d punch them in the face   The two spar briefly and leave the danger room to get some beers  In Shan s interview  the comic reveals that someone else was in control of Legion when Marci died  It is implied that he abused her in some way  as when Shan looked at him she knew what he had done as though she had done it  and she wanted the memory gone  She then took the Soulsword and proceeded to kill the personality  It is then revealed Magik told Rao that she killed the personality  taking the blame for Shan  Finally  the comic shows Warlock in the ruins of the Xavier Institute where he finds a picture or himself and his friends among the wreckage  He then sees Cypher s grave is empty   edit  Necrosha The next arc opens with Professor Charles Xavier asking Danger if he can see his son  Legion  He ponders if he only has bad effects on his students  The New Mutants then join him  He is over joyed to see his young students all grown up and they are happy see him  Outside the recently resurrected Cypher watches the exchange showing his powers to have evolved as now he can read body language and figures out what people are really saying  He is able to find out insecurities and such through this  He is then contacted by Warlock but Selene s objectives override Warlock  His mission is to take out Magma and does so by hiding in her room  He tells her that  They brought me back  and points behind her  Amara looks and Doug knocks her out  He then pulls Amara into the kitchen where the rest of the New Mutants are with a message from Selene  They are all shocked to see him again after so long and attack him after realising Magma has been badly wounded  Using his translation powers he easily dodges and counter attack Roberto  Sam and Magik  Karma then attempts to possess him but it fails  Dani attacks him but she gets beaten  Roberto and Sam try again but again are defeated when Doug throws Roberto into the oncoming Sam  Karma then out thinks Doug and uses all the other New Mutants to attack him  Since there is not method to their movements he is unable to translate it and ends up punched out a window and into the water  The team worry about Amara and realise something is going down all over Utopia  They are quickly silenced as Warlock appears having saved Doug and Sam who had flown out the window under Karma s control  He attempts to fix Doug as he is infected with malicious code  He is then attacked and decapitated by Doug  Doug throws Warlock s head off Utopia but is attacked by the code Warlock introduced and is freed from Selene s control  As the new virus takes hold the Devil appears  It is then revealed that it is the enemy team of the New Mutants  the Hellions  As Jetstream goes to enter the room Dani thows a knife and closes the door  The door then slices Jetstream in half  Cypher is still dealing with Warlock s code battling the other code that revived him  Tarot s devil reappears and Magik slices it in half with her Soulsword  Jetstream is revealed to still be alive and attacks Doug  The rest of the Hellions appear and try to take Doug away as he screams a plea for help to Sam who is about to teleport away on one of Magik s teleport disks  They then find themselves on a partially destroyed Utopia with the X Men fighting newly resurrected foes  Karma then tells the others that she thinks that it is the real Doug and expresses anxiety at having left him behind  Colossus is punched towards the team where a funny little exchange between Illyana and Piotr occurs when he warns her about the dead walking as she replies with  We are not ones to talk   Roberto then assists Colossus in defeating their resurrected enemy  Roberto is still worried about Amara while Sam decides to save Doug because  The Hellions want him  That means I want him more   The comic then cuts to Doug being re infected with Selene s virus  Then the comic shows a small fish turn to yellow energy near Warlock s head signalling that he is not out for the count  Warlock continues killing sea creatures in order to heal himself  while Bobby runs Amara to the Infirmary  Dani is with them but they are set upon by Feral  Doug is being made evil again by the Hellions when Karma attempts to take control of them  This leads to Roulette admitting she thought that she loved Doug at some point  Sam  Amara and Ilyana are then seen  Feral jumps on Dani and she stabs Feral  Feral then goes for Amara but Roberto rips her arm off  Dani then throws the arm out the window and Feral jumps after it  The Hellions and the New Mutants then begin to fight to save Doug  All of Tarot s cards are defeated by Illyana s Soulsword  She is then knocked off the platform they are fighting on while Karma and Sam try to fight off the rest as Doug remains dealing with the two TO strains in his system  Magik then finds Warlock and purges him of the malicious code  Dr  Nemesis then saves Amara in the infirmary  The Hellions prepare to kill Doug but Warlock returns looking emaciated  He cannot defeat the Hellions so he calls the two missiles he gave life to  They prepare to explode as Warlock grabs Doug and jumps through a teleportation disk  They then explode and kill the Hellions  He then uses Magik s Soulsword to purge Doug of the TO virus completely   edit  Prelude to Fall of the New Mutants The issue opens with a scientist being told someone is returning from  hell   A group of soldiers then return  many of whom are scarred and one has a seemingly demonic hand  The comic then opens on Utopia with Warlock and Cypher being checked for the TO virus by Maddison Jeffries  Dr  Nemesis  Danger  Cyclops and Emma Frost  Danger starts to come on to Warlock  where it is also referenced that Jeffries has feelings for Danger  Warlock then refers to Illyana as Magik 2

her old friend Gus Grim  a Native American Cognitive Therapist from Colorado known for his work in the Cheyenne communities  to help her  damaged  teammates  She first brings him to see Nate Grey  but Grim never talks to Grey  and instead recommends that Moonstar let him battle something  real  in the Danger Room so Grey can push himself  Grim then talks to Cannonball  who has put himself under psychiatric observation in a secure ward  Grim believes that Cannonball took himself out of a leadership position because he was too afraid of failing  and that he is still capable of leading if he was simply willing to put aside those feelings  He then goes to see Karma  who has stayed out of the field to be with Face  a sense deprived mutant whom she shares a psychic bond with  Grim tells Karma that there are any number of telepaths or empaths who could engage with Face  and the fact that she wants to do it alone is selfish of her  Lastly  Grim is taken to see Magik  who is imprisoned

from this ordeal  and Magik explains that the demons used his body as a Trojan Horse to get into Utopia to rescue her  As Grim gets ready to leave Utopia  Moonstar fears that his experiences have put him off from doing regular sessions with her teammates  but Grim is surprised that Moonstar would even want him to do more sessions after how hard he went into her teammates  Moonstar explains that
