Marvel Universe From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search For other uses  see Marvel Universe  disambiguation   Various characters of the Marvel Universe  Promotional Art for the Civil War event by Steve McNiven  The Marvel Universe is the shared fictional universe where stories in most comic book titles and other media published by Marvel Entertainment take place  including those featuring Marvel s most familiar characters  such as Spider Man  the Hulk  the X Men  and the Avengers  The Marvel Universe is further depicted as existing within a  multiverse  consisting of thousands of separate universes  all of which are the creations of Marvel Comics and all of which are  in a sense   Marvel universes   In this context   Marvel Universe  is taken to refer to the mainstream Marvel continuity  which is known as Earth 616  Contents 1 History 1 1 Origins 1 2 New Universe 1 3 Heroes Reborn and Ultimate Marvel 2 Concepts 2 1 Costumed superheroes and

citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   August 2009   edit  Origins Though the concept of a shared universe was not new or unique to comics in 1961  writer editor Stan Lee  together with several artists including Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko  created a series of titles where events in one book would have repercussions in another title and serialized stories would show characters  growth and change  Headline characters in one title would make cameo or guest appearances in other books  Eventually many of the leading heroes assembled into a team known as the Avengers  This was not the first time that Marvel s characters had interacted with one another Namor the Sub Mariner and the Original Human Torch had been rivals in Marvel s  Golden Age  but it was the first time that the comic book publisher s characters seemed to share a world  The Marvel Universe was also notable for setting its central titles in New York City  by contrast  many DC heroes live in fictional cities  Care was taken to portray the city and the world as realistically as possible with the presence of superhumans affecting the common citizens in various ways  Over time  a few Marvel Comics writers lobbied Marvel editors to incorporate the idea of a Multiverse resembling DC s parallel worlds  this plot device allows one to create several fictional universes which normally do not overlap  see below or Multiverse for more information   What happens on Earth in the main Marvel Universe would normally have no effect on what happens on a parallel Earth in another Marvel created universe  However  storywriters would have the creative ability to write stories in which people from one such universe would visit this alternate universe  In 1982  Marvel published the mini series Contest of Champions  in which all of the major heroes in existence at the time were gathered together to deal with one threat  This was Marvel s first miniseries  Each issue contained biographical information on many major costumed characters  these biographies were a precursor to Marvel s series of reference material  The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  which followed shortly on the heels of Contest of Champions   edit  New Universe In 1986  in honor of Marvel Comics  25th anniversary  then editor in chief Jim Shooter launched the New Universe line of comics  The New Universe was intended to be a more realistic Marvel universe than others  with less reliance on standard comic book clich s  but due to a combination of a lack of editorial support and fewer sales than the mainstream titles the line was eventually canceled   edit  Heroes Reborn and Ultimate Marvel Over the years  as the number of titles published increased and the volume of past stories accumulated  it became increasingly difficult to maintain internal consistency and continuity  But  unlike its main rival DC Comics  Marvel has never engaged in a drastic reboot of their continuity  Minor attempts have been made in recent years to produce stories more accessible for neophyte readers such as the Heroes Reborn titles  which occurred in a pocket universe where many of the major Marvel heroes were exiled for a year  The most successful attempt to date has been the Ultimate titles  a series of titles in a universe separate from the main Marvel continuity and essentially starting the entire Marvel Universe over from scratch  often with changes to the character s stories  Ongoing  Ultimate  comics were made for the X Men  the Avengers  in the form of the Ultimates   Spider Man  and the Fantastic Four  as well as miniseries featuring other characters such as Daredevil and Elektra  Sales of these titles are strong  and indications are that Marvel will continue to expand the line  effectively creating two Marvel Universes existing concurrently  In fact the Ultimate titles have done so well they have been the basis for several video games  Ultimate Spider Man and X Men Legends   and two animated movies  Ultimate Avengers and Ultimate Avengers 2  Recent sales of the Ultimate line have suffered  While many have posited reason for this  economic trends  editorial decisions  or an increase in cover price   the most widely cited reason tends to be the largely unsuccessful Ultimatum crossover  1  in 2010 the Ultimate Universe has been rearranged again including the formation of a new X Men team  a new Avengers team and a new Spider Man all of who are significantly different than their original counterparts   edit  Concepts This section may contain original research  Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding references  Statements consisting only of original research may be removed  More details may be available on the talk page   August 2009  The Marvel Universe is strongly based on the real world  Earth in the Marvel Universe has all the features of the real one  same countries  same personalities  politicians  movie stars  etc    same historical events  such as the September 11  2001 attacks   and so on  However  it also contains many other fictional elements  countries such as Wakanda and Latveria  very small nations   and organizations like the espionage agency S H I E L D  and its enemy  HYDRA  In 2009 Marvel to officially described its world s geography in a two part miniseries  the Marvel Atlas  2  Most importantly  the Marvel Universe also incorporates examples of almost all major science fiction and fantasy concepts  with writers adding more continuously  Aliens  gods  magic  cosmic powers and extremely advanced human developed technology all exist prominently in the Marvel Universe   A universe incorporating all these types of fantastic elements is fairly rare  another example is the DC Universe   Monsters also play a more prominent role with east asian origins of magical incantation  outlandish sorcery and manifesting principle in the Marvel Universe  One such case is Fin Fang Foom arising from the ashes of tantric magic  Thanks to these extra elements  Earth in the Marvel Universe is home to a large number of superheroes and supervillains  who have gained their powers by any of these means  Comparatively little time passes in the Marvel Universe compared to the real world  owing to the serial nature of storytelling  with the stories of certain issues picking up mere seconds after the conclusion of the previous one  while a whole month has passed by in  real time   Marvel s major heroes were created in the 1960s  but the amount of time that has passed between then and now within the universe itself has  after a prolonged period of being identified as about ten years in the mid to late 1990s  most recently been identified as thirteen years  3  Consequently  the settings of some events which were contemporary when written have to be updated every few years in order to  make sense  in this floating timeline  Thus  the events of previous stories are considered to have happened within a certain number of years prior to the publishing date of the current issue  For example  Spider Man s high school graduation was published in Amazing Spider Man  28  September 1965   his college graduation in Amazing Spider Man  185  October 1978   and his high school reunion in Marvel Knights  Spider Man  7  December 2004   Because of the floating timeline  where stories reference real life historic events  these references are later ignored or rewritten to suit current sensibilities  For instance  the origin of Iron Man was recently changed to refer to armed conflict in Afghanistan  whereas the original Iron Man stories had referred to the Vietnam War  4  The Marvel Comics company itself exists within the Marvel Universe  and versions of people such as Stan Lee and Jack Kirby have appeared in some of the stories  whereas characters like Steve Rogers   Captain America s alter ego   have worked for Marvel  The Marvel of this reality publishes comics that adapt the actual adventures of the superheroes  except for details not known to the public  like their secret identities   many of these are licensed with the permission of the heroes themselves  who customarily donate their share of profits to charity  Additionally  the DC Comics Universe is also said to exist in the Marvel Universe as one of the many alternate universes  The reverse may also be said with respect to the DC Universe  This is one method of explaining the various crossover stories co published by the two companies  Pop culture characters such as Dracula and Frankenstein actually exist in the Marvel Universe  This is usually justified as a second hand account of events as told to credited authors Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley although the general public continues to believe them as fictional  Robert E  Howard s Conan the Barbarian  Red Sonja  Kull the Conqueror  and Solomon Kane also have real life existences in the Marvel Universe  The Hyborian Era of Conan and Kull is considered part of Earth 616 pre recorded history  However  they rarely encounter modern Marvel superhero characters  This is most likely possible due to the uncertain legal status of Howard s works prior to 2006 when they became public domain  Other licensed works that have been incorporated into the Marvel Universe include Godzilla  2001  A Space Odyssey  in the character of Machine Man   ROM  Spaceknight  the Micronauts  and the Shogun Warriors  In most cases  such material is either restricted from use after the license expires or the characters redesigned or renamed to avoid infringement   edit  Costumed superheroes and supervillains Within the fictional history of the Marvel Universe  the tradition of using costumed secret identities to fight or commit evil had long existed  but it came into prominence during the days of the American  Wild West  with heroes such as the Phantom Rider  During the 20th century the tradition was reinvigorated by Captain America and his fellow Invaders in the 1940s  who fought for the Allies of World War II  Marvel s major heroes are those created between 1961 and 1963  during Marvel s  Silver Age   Spider Man  Iron Man  Doctor Strange  Daredevil  Thor  the Hulk  Ant Man and the Wasp  the X Men  the Fantastic Four  and S H I E L D  s director  Nick Fury  Unlike the DC Universe  few of Marvel s 1940s characters have become major characters in modern publications  Captain America is one exception  and to a lesser extent his contemporary  the Sub Mariner  is as well  primarily because both of these characters were reintroduced to readers and to the Marvel Universe during the 1960s  Prominent groups of superheroes include the Avengers  the X Men  the Fantastic Four  and the Defenders  All these groups have varying lineups  the Avengers in particular have included most of Marvel s major heroes as members at one time or another  The X Men are a team of mutants formed by Professor X and include some of Marvel s most popular characters  such as Wolverine  The Defenders are an ad hoc team usually brought together by Dr  Strange  which has included the Hulk  the Sub Mariner and the Silver Surfer  During the last five years  many previously costumed supervillains have been portrayed in street clothes  Recently published comics show that this trend may have been temporary   edit  Origin of superhuman powers Most of the superhumans in Marvel s Earth owe their powers to the Celestials  cosmic entities who visited Earth millions of years ago and experimented on our prehistoric ancestors  a process they also carried out on several other planets   This resulted in the creation of two hidden races  the godlike Eternals and the genetically unstable Deviants  in addition to giving some humans an  x factor  in their genes  which sometimes activates naturally  resulting in sometimes superpowered  sometimes disfigured individuals called mutants  Others require other factors  such as radiation  for their powers to come forth  Depending on the genetic profile  individuals who are exposed to different chemicals or radiation will often suffer death or injury  while in others it will cause superhuman abilities to manifest  With the exception of psionic abilities  these powers are usually random  rarely do two people have exactly the same set of powers  It is not clear why the Celestials did this  although it is known that they continue to observe humanity s evolution  A Marvel series titled Earth X explored one possible reason for this  that superhumans are meant to protect a Celestial embryo that grows inside the Earth and has for eons  against any planetary threats  An X Men villain known as Vargas claims to be a new direction in human evolution  as he is born with superpowers even though his genetic profile said he was an ordinary human being  The majority of the public is unaware of what may cause superhuman powers  Other possible origins for superhuman powers include magic  genetic manipulation and or bionic implants  Some heroes and villains have no powers at all but depend instead on hand to hand combat training or advanced technological equipment  In the Marvel Universe  technology is considerably more advanced than in the real world  this is due to unique individuals of genius intelligence  such as Reed Richards  Mister Fantastic  of the Fantastic Four  However  most of the really advanced devices  such as powered armor and death rays  are too expensive for the common citizen  and are usually in the hands of government organizations like S H I E L D   or powerful criminal organizations like A I M  One major company producing these devices is Stark International  owned by Anthony Stark  Iron Man   but there are others  Advanced technology has also been given to humans by hidden races  aliens  or time travelers like Kang the Conqueror  who is known to have influenced the robotics industry in the past  In superhumans the energy required for their superpowers either comes from within using their own body as a source  or if the demand of energy exceeds what their body is capable to deliver  comes from another source  In most cases  this other source seems to be what is called the universal psionic field  UPF   which they are able to tap into  Sometimes they are connected to another source  and more rarely they are even a host for it  Marvel tries to explain most superpowers and their sources  scientifically   usually through the use of fictional science like concepts  such as  The battery effect  the cells in the body have the same function as batteries  being charged with energy that comes from an outer source  This is most often seen in gamma exposed individuals such as the Hulk  who get their powers from this stored energy  The powers will remain as long as the energy is present  and can even be increased by filling the  batteries  even more  If the energy is emptied  the powers will fade away  The X Man Cyclops has been described as absorbing sunlight to power his optic blasts  The Power Primordial is a leftover force from Big Bang and is controlled by the Elders of the Universe  Phoenix Force is a force of incredible power  It channels energy from life itself and has been shown to favor mutant telepaths like Jean Grey  Psionic energy  which is assumed to be an invisible  unknown form of energy generated by all living brains that has the ability to manipulate other forms of matter and energy  Universal psionic field is a force present everywhere in the universe  but only those with abilities to connect to it can make use of its energy  Enigma Force is suspected to be connected to the Microverse  and is also the source to the Uni Power  which transforms an individual into Captain Universe  Extradimensional space  dimensions that can be tapped in order to pull mass from them  to add to objects on Earth  or taken away from those objects and be stored in those  pocket dimensions  to be retrieved later  This is how characters like the Hulk can grow and shrink with no visible absorption of mass  A type of subatomic particles called Pym Particles can be used for these effects   Note that many giant sized characters have a limited ability to manipulate gravity to handle their increased weight   The change in mass can be in the form of a density change instead  allowing a character to become harder or incorporeal  Some characters can seem to  transform  themselves  or others  into unliving substances  or even pure energy  by storing their bodies in extradimensional space and replacing them with bodies made from matter or energy from that dimension  while their souls remain on Earth  controlling their new body  Travel into other dimensions can also be used as a way to  teleport  by re entering the Earth dimension at a different point from the exiting one  The Darkforce is an unknown  dark substance from another dimension  known simply as the Darkforce Dimension  that can be summoned and manipulated in many ways  to create impenetrable darkness  to solidify it in various forms  and  most notably  to absorb the  life energy  from living beings  not all users can use all these effects   The Darkforce can also be used to travel to and from its home dimension  but this is dangerous to all except those with Darkforce powers  Some believe that the Darkforce is sentient and sometimes has an evil influence on those who use it  Various heroes and villains have versions of Darkforce powers  including Darkstar  the first Blackout  the Shroud  Cloak  Doorman and Quagmire  of the Squadron Supreme Universe   Cloak seems to be the prime  portal  to the Darkforce  however  The Living Light is the opposite of the Darkforce  a form of energy that resembles light and also comes from its own dimension  but has healing effects on living beings  except ones made of darkness or Darkforce   It is unknown if it might be sentient  Cloak s partner  Dagger seems to be the Living Light s main Avatar  The Power Cosmic is a force that can alter reality  allowing the user to do whatever he or she wants  including bending the laws of physics   only being limited by how much cosmic energy the character can tap at a time  It seems to be part of the universe itself  and is most prominently used by Galactus and his heralds  Magic also appears to be like a form of energy  except that it can defy the laws of physics naturally  and usually overrules ordinary science  However  it does have rules of its own to follow  which vary with the method of invocation  usually in the form of spoken spells  It appears to be present in everything  even living beings  All humans in the Marvel Universe have the ability to use magic  but only if properly trained  Most people are unaware that magic actually works  In addition  powerful magical beings from other dimensions have created specific  extremely powerful magical spells that they allow to be used  often indiscriminately  by those sorcerers who invoke their names  one example is the trinity of beings called The Vishanti  who serve as patrons to heroic sorcerers  At any given time  there is a sorcerer on Earth whose task is to protect the universe against extradimensional mystical invaders  this sorcerer is known as the Sorcerer Supreme  an office most recently held by Brother Voodoo  Stars in the Marvel Universe are actually sentient beings  and the source of all mystic energy  citation needed   edit  Nonhuman races A degree of paranoid fear against mutants exists due to stories of mutants being a race or even a species  Homo superior or Homo sapiens superior  that is evolving and is meant to replace normal humans  This has caused organizations to form to deal with the problem  who can be divided into three camps  those who seek peaceful coexistence between mutants and normal humans  the X Men and their affiliated groups   those who seek to control or eliminate humans to give mutants safety or dominance  Magneto and his followers  as well as other mutants such as Apocalypse   and those who seek to regulate or eliminate mutants in favor of humans  The latter often use the robots known as Sentinels as weapons  Certain species are regarded as subhuman  disambiguation needed   like the Morlocks who lurk beneath New York City and have been discriminated against by the outside world because of their mutant deformities  The Morlocks have recently joined the terrorist organization Gene Nation  In addition to mutants  Eternals and Deviants  several other intelligent races have existed secretly on Earth  These include  The Inhumans  another genetically unstable race  like the Deviants  but in their case its due to their use of a substance called the  Terrigen Mists   that was created by a Kree experiment long ago  The Subterraneans  a race of humanoids adapted to living below the surface  created by the Deviants  some subterraneans were transformed into  Lava Men  by a demon   and Homo mermanus  a humanoid race of water breathers that lives in Earth s oceans  Most of these races have advanced technology but existed hidden from humanity until recent times  More variants of humanity can be found in the Savage Land  see places  below   Most of the Savage Land races have their origin from a group of primitive ape men who seems to have escaped the Celestial experiments whose influence is present in all modern Homo sapiens  Other leftovers from the era where primitive humanoids walked the earth still exist  such as the altered Neanderthal known as Missing Link  an old enemy of the Hulk   edit  Alien races The Marvel Universe also contains hundreds of intelligent alien races  Earth has interacted with many of them because a major  hyperspace warp  happens to exist in our solar system  Main article  List of Marvel Comics alien races The three major space empires are  the Kree  who rule the Kree Galaxy  the Greater Magellanic Cloud  the Skrulls  who rule the Skrull Galaxy  the Andromeda Galaxy  the Shi ar  who rule the Shi ar Galaxy  no known real world counterpart  but might possibly be the Triangulum Galaxy citation needed   The three are often in direct or indirect conflict  which occasionally involve Earth people  in particular  the Kree and Skrulls are ancient enemies  and the Kree Skrull War has involved humans on several occasions  The Skrulls have also been known to be in a long and consistent war against the Majesdanians  who live in a milky planet named Majesdane  5  The war between the two had started after two Majesdanians  Frank and Leslie Dean of The Pride had been kicked out for criminal activities  the two travelled to Earth  where Frank and Leslie stopped the war against Earth in exchange for giving the Skrulls the location of Majesdane  which was hidden behind the corona of a white dwarf  The war had gone on for sixteen years minimum  it ended abruptly after the Skrulls shot a barrage of missiles at Majesdane  who retaliated  5  Another prominent alien race is The Watchers  immortal and wise beings who watch over the Marvel Universe and have taken a sacred vow not to intervene in events  though the Watcher assigned to Earth  Uatu  has violated this oath on several occasions  The Elders of the Universe are ancient aliens who have often had great impact on many worlds  for billions of years  acting alone or as a group  A power called Power Primordial is channeled through them  Many other races exist  and have formed an  Intergalactic Council  to have their say on matters that affect them all  such as interference from Earth humans in their affairs  In Secret Wars  Spider Man s symbiotic black costume made its first appearance  Later with Eddie Brock  it became the being known as Venom  who is now one of Spider Man s greatest foes and has spawned Carnage   edit  Supernatural creatures Also abundant in the Marvel Universe are legendary creatures such as gods  demons and vampires  The  gods  of most polytheistic pantheons are actually powerful  immortal human like races from other dimensions who visited Earth in ancient times  and became the basis of many legends  Besides mythological gods  many deities made up by Marvel writers exist as well  such as the Dark Gods  enemies of the Asgardians  Many persons and beings have falsely pretended to be gods or demons during history  in particular  none of the ones claiming to be major figures from Judeo Christian beliefs has turned out to be the real article  although a number of angels have appeared in recent years  as well as an apparent true rebellion and expulsion of angels from a higher realm known as Paradise  proving that some form of Heaven and Hell do exist in this Universe  seemingly like those in keeping with common real world religious belief  Similarly  demons are evil magical beings who take affairs in the matters of the universe  Some of the most powerful are Blackheart  Mephisto  Nightmare  Satannish  and Zom  There are also powerful benevolent mystical entities such as The Vishanti  or amoral and malevolent entities who are not truly demonic in nature  such as Dormammu and The Octessence  or ones heavily drawing upon the mythology of H P  Lovecraft  such as Shuma Gorath  Most of the current generation of gods have been revealed to be the descendants of the Elder Goddess Gaea  The two most featured pantheons are the Asgardians  of whom Thor is a member  and the Olympians  of whom Hercules is a member   The lords of the various pantheons sometimes gather in groups known as the Council of Godheads and Council of Skyfathers  The gods were forced to stop meddling with humanity  at least openly  a thousand years ago by the Celestials  and most people today believe them to be fictional   edit  Cosmic entities The cosmic entities are beings of unbelievably great levels of power  the weakest of whom can destroy planets  who exist to perform duties that maintain the existence of the universe  Most do not care at all about  lesser beings  such as humans  and as a consequence their acts are recurrently dangerous to mortals  When dire threats threaten the universe it is not uncommon for these beings to gather together to discuss the threat  and even act  Above all pantheons of gods  mystical beings  and cosmic conceptual entities there exists one  supreme  God   a mysterious but apparently benign entity sometimes referred to as the One Above All  This being is indicated to be the Creator of all existence and all realities of the Marvel Universe and possibly beyond  The Living Tribunal is the cosmic judge  overseer  and mediator  It safeguards the multiverse from dire threats  but is also willing to destroy entire universes on behalf of more favoured creations  Most conceptual entities are simply interested in furthering their own essential function  or to keep the balance with an opposing force  However  certain cosmic entities  such as Galactus  In Betweener  Maelstrom  or The Stranger have demonstrated personality  motivations  or  except for the first mention  even ambitions beyond their functions  but often maintain the perspective that morality is entirely relative  or that destroying civilisations of  lesser  beings is no more evil than if these beings destroyed an anthill  Others such as Uatu the Watcher  Eon  or the Celestials Ashema and Tiamut are aberrations in the sense of sympathising with and occasionally coming to the defense of humanity  The  Fulcrum  is a comparatively recent addition to the hierarchy  that  all  cosmic entities allegedly serve  of a level of raw power stated to far surpass the might of the Watchers and the Celestials  Unlike most other entities it is capable of conscience  compassion  and even a sense of humour  and has stated that it wants other cosmic beings to develop such as well  The Phoenix Force first received personification in Jean Grey  The Force is composed of the psionic energy from all living beings  past  present and future  and is sometimes referred to as an embodiment of rebirth and destructive transformation through  burning away what doesn t work   and helped to restart the universe before the Big Bang   edit  Cosmology Main article  Marvel Comics Multiverse The Marvel Universe is part of a multiverse  with various universes coexisting simultaneously without affecting each other directly   edit  Universes Earths continuities The action of most Marvel Comics titles takes place in a continuity known as Earth 616  This continuity exists in a multiverse alongside trillions of alternate continuities  6  Alternate continuities in the Marvel multiverse are generally defined in terms of their differences from Earth 616  Continuities besides Earth 616 include the following  for a complete listing see Multiverse  Marvel Comics    Age of Apocalypse Alterniverse Amalgam House of M Marvel Age Marvel Zombies MC2 New Universe Ultimate Marvel X Men Adventures   Originally based on the X Men animated series  this universe went on to feature more original stories  and in its final issue  revealed itself to be the universe which existed prior to the current 616 reality  when it was destroyed by the fracturing of the M Kraan crystal  The current edition of the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe corroborates this  X Men  Evolution  based on the X Men Evolution animated series  In addition  multiple continuities are visited in the comic book series What If  What The      formerly Not Brand Echh  and Exiles  The concept of a continuity is not the same as  dimension  or  universe   for example  characters like Mephisto and Dormammu hail from alternate dimensions and Galactus from another universe  but they all nevertheless belong to the Earth 616 continuity  where all the dimensions and universes seems to be connected to the same main timeline   A continuity should also not be confused with an imprint  for example  while the titles of some imprints  such as Ultimate Marvel  take place in a different continuity  some or all publications in other imprints  such as Epic Comics  Marvel MAX  and Marvel UK  take place within the Earth 616 continuity   edit  Dimensions Within and sometimes between continuities  there exist a variety of dimensions  sometimes called pocket dimensions which typically are not depicted as separate continuities  but rather part of one  typically Earth 616  There are a score of such dimensions  ranging from the Earthlike to the totally alien  Some are magical in nature and others are scientific  some are inhabited and others are not  These include realities like the Microverse  the Darkforce Dimension  Limbo  the Mojoverse  and many more  The Astral Plane is a dimensional plane which is the source of telekinesis and various other psychic powers  It is a dimension created by the Elder Goddess Oshtur that is sometimes referred to as the  Temple of Oshtur  or the  Realm of the Mind   7  Despite various contradictions  the term  dimension is sometimes interchangeable with universe or reality  Every reality of the Marvel Universe has numerous interconnected dimensions  with each dimension differing from those of other realities  for example  the Ultimate Asgard has clearly been shown to be distinct from the Asgard known to Earth 616 characters  Such dimensions  such as Asgard or the Dark Dimension are technically not  pocket dimensions  as they clearly reside completely outside the boundaries of the Marvel Universe  instead of within  as the former does   edit  Time One cannot normally alter the Marvel Universe s history  if a time traveller should cause an alteration to the established flow of events at some point in the past  a divergent universe will simply  branch out  from the existing timeline  and the time traveller will still return to his or her unaltered original universe  Those realities can also spawn realities of their own  There exists hundreds  probably thousands of such realities  It is unknown why this happens  though a warp known as the Nexus of All Realities exists in a swamp in the Florida of Earth 616  For the most part this does not matter  as most beings are unaware that this occurs  or even that their universes were recently  born  from another  However  individuals and organizations exist that try to monitor or manipulate the various realities  These include Immortus  the Captain Britain Corps  the Time Variance Authority  the Timebreakers Exiles  and Kang the Conqueror s forces  It has been shown to be possible to travel through time without creating a new alternate universe  instead altering events in the future  but this seems to have devastating and very far reaching repercussions  as depicted in Marvel 1602  it almost destroyed the whole multiverse  including the afterlife   Also  time itself passes much differently within the confines of the Marvel Universe than it does in the real world  Despite various characters having appeared within company publications for decades  few if any have aged to any appreciable degree  For example  the patriotic hero Captain America was created in 1941 but stopped appearing in titles soon after the end of World War II  The character was revived more than twenty years later  explained as having been frozen in a block of ice though believed to be dead  to lead Marvel s latest team of superheroes the Avengers  This first Avengers team featured several characters that would go on to be some of the company s most famous and most popular  Although the characters would be portrayed in hundreds and even thousands of adventures over the decades  they have been portrayed as having aged little or none at all  Naturally this tendency is purely due to story conveniences  or a somewhat haphazardly shifting patchwork pattern of authors   and mainly that the fictional  continuity  has been maintained and expanded far beyond what Stan Lee and others originally planned or hoped for  Hence  the passing of time was more discernible in the very early years  such as the graduation of Spider Man  and what started as children or teenaged characters  such as Kitty Pryde  Franklin Richards  Valeria Richards  Power Pack  or the New Mutants are all allowed to age at wildly shifting rates  in the second case even backwards at times   whereas surrounding characters somewhat dependent on a certain age limit do not change at all  This recurrently creates inherently contradictory effects  as events are routinely described to have happened several years ago  even in cases when this would mean that some of the involved character would have been toddlers  Different approaches also exist regarding allowing  second generation  descendants of heroes or villains  fully grown over 18 years after an event  for example Hulkling  other members of the Young Avengers  Runaways  and Secret Warriors   whereas other books  such as Young Allies use the inherent contradiction to debunk similar claims  If a past storyline wherein a direct depictions of a then current president or similar is referenced in a later era  it tends to become updated accordingly  sometimes with an  in joke  acknowledgement   edit  Space While the Marvel Universe is presumably as large as the non fictional universe comic book readers inhabit  for all intents and purposes the Local group is the universe  practically all action takes place in it  The Skrull Empire is located in the Andromeda galaxy  the Kree Empire in the Magellan clouds which are satellites of the Milky Way galaxy in which Earth of course is found  while the Shi ar Empire is located somewhere between them in one of the smaller galaxies  perhaps Triangulum   frequently  these three empires are quoted as the main political powers  in the universe   Similarly  the Local Group seemed to be the only affected area when the Annihilation Wave cut its bloody swath  across the universe   An exception to the  Local group  rule is Planet Hulk  which not only took place in another galactic cluster but indeed another galactic supercluster  namely Fornax   edit  Role playing games Four role playing games have been set in the Marvel Universe  Marvel Super Heroes  TSR  1984  Marvel Super Heroes Adventure Game  TSR  1998  Marvel Universe
