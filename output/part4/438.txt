Halo  Combat Evolved  also referred to as Halo  CE  or simply Halo  is a first person shooter video game developed by Bungie and published by Microsoft Game Studios  The first game of the Halo franchise  it was released on November 15  2001 as a launch title for the Xbox gaming system  1  and is considered the platform s  killer app   7  With more than five million copies sold worldwide as of November 9  2005  8  Microsoft released versions of the game for Microsoft Windows  ported by Gearbox Software  and Mac OS X in 2003  and the surrounding storyline was adapted and elaborated into a series of novels and comic books  The game was later released as an Xbox Original for download onto an Xbox 360 HDD  Halo is set in the twenty sixth century  with the player assuming the role of the Master Chief  a cybernetically enhanced super soldier  The player is accompanied by Cortana  an artificial intelligence who occupies the Master Chief s neural interface  Players battle various aliens as they attempt to uncover the secrets of the eponymous Halo  a ring shaped artificial world  The game has been called  easy to learn   9  and has been praised for its  engaging story   10  Many game magazines have praised Halo as one of the best 11  and most important 12  games of all time  The game s popularity has led to labels such as  Halo clone  13  and  Halo killer   applied respectively to games either similar to or anticipated to be better than it  14  15  In addition  the game inspired and was used in the fan created Red vs  Blue video series  which is credited as the  first big success  of machinima 16   the technique of using real time 3D engines  often from video games  to create animated films   Two sequels  Halo 2 and Halo 3  a side game  Halo 3  ODST  and a prequel  Halo  Reach  were released in 2004  2007  2009  and 2010  respectively  A remake  Halo  Combat Evolved Anniversary  was released in 2011  on the 10th anniversary of the original game s release  Halo 4  a planned sequel by 343 Industries  is currently in development  Contents 1 Gameplay 1 1 Combatants 1 2 Multiplayer 2 Plot 2 1 Setting 2 2 Characters 2 3 Story 2 4 Cast 3 Development 3 1 Audio 4 Reception 4 1 Legacy 5 Adaptations 5 1 Halo  Combat Evolved Anniversary 6 References 7 External links  edit  Gameplay As a first person shooter  Halo  Combat Evolved has a gameplay fundamentally similar to that of its peers  focusing on combat in a 3D environment  and taking place almost entirely from a character s eye view  The player can move around and look up  down  left or right  17  The game features vehicles  ranging from armored jeeps and tanks to alien hovercraft and aircraft  many of which can be controlled by the player  The game switches to the third person perspective during vehicle use for pilots and mounted gun operators  passengers maintain a first person view  18  The Master Chief fires his Assault Rifle at a pack of Grunts on the level  Halo   Ammunition  health  and motion sensor displays are visible in the corners of the screen  The player character is equipped with a damage absorbing energy shield  in addition to hit points  The shield s charge appears as a blue bar in the upper right hand corner of the game s heads up display  When the shield is fully depleted  the player is highly vulnerable  and further damage is applied directly to the character s health level  10  Critically  the shield will recharge if no further damage is sustained for a brief period  19  Halo s arsenal consists of weapons from science fiction  The game has been praised for giving each weapon a unique purpose  thus making them useful in different scenarios  20  For example  plasma weapons need time to cool if fired too rapidly  but cannot be reloaded and must be discarded upon depletion of battery  In contrast  conventional firearms cannot overheat  but require reloading and ammunition  Players may carry only two weapons at once  thus  a strategy is required when using and selecting firearms  21  Halo departs from traditional FPS conventions by not forcing the player character to holster their firearm before deploying grenades or melee range blunt instruments  instead  both attacks can be utilized while a gun is still equipped  supplanting or supplementing small arms fire  19  All weapons may be used to bludgeon enemies  19  which allows the Master Chief to silently kill opponents without alerting other nearby enemies  22  The Chief can also carry up to eight grenades at a time  four fragmentation and four plasma grenades each  23  Like the game s other weapons  the two types of grenades differ  the fragmentation grenade bounces and detonates quickly  24  whereas the plasma grenade adheres to targets before exploding  sometimes with blackly comic results  25   edit  Combatants The game s main enemy force is the Covenant  a group of alien species allied by belief in a common religion  Their forces include Elites  fierce warriors protected by recharging energy shields much like the player s own  Grunts  which are short  cowardly creatures  usually led by Elites  and who often flee in terror instead of fighting unless an Elite is present  Jackals  which wear highly durable energy shields on their arms  and Hunters  large  powerful creatures with thick armor plates that cover the majority of their bodies  26  A secondary enemy is the Flood  a parasitic alien life form that appears in three main variants  27  Infection Forms  the true form of the Flood  are fragile and do little damage individually  but often travel in swarms of several dozen  Combat Forms result from humans and Covenant Elites who have succumbed to the Infection Forms  and have hideously deformed bodies  Bloated Carrier Forms are the result of an aged or unused Combat Form and serve as incubators for new Infection Forms  when wounded or near a potential victim  they explode to damage other nearby life forms and to release their spores  thus perpetuating the life cycle  Battling the Flood  Covenant and human forces are the Sentinels  robotic drones designed by an extinct race called the Forerunners  Sentinels lack durability  but use powerful beam weapons and are immune to infection by the Flood  27  The artificial intelligence in Halo has been favorably received  28  Enemies take cover and use suppressive fire and grenades  20  Some enemies retreat when their superiors are killed  29  The player is often aided by United Nations Space Command  UNSC  Marines  who offer ground support  such as manning gun turrets or riding shotgun while the player is driving a vehicle  20   edit  Multiplayer As Halo was released before Xbox Live  online multiplayer games were not officially supported  30  The game instead uses local Ethernet or  system link  that supports a maximum of 16 players  This setup was a first for a console game  but was often deemed impractical by critics  20  22  As Halo lacks artificially intelligent game bots  LAN parties are needed to reach the game s 16 player limit  In addition to five customizable competitive multiplayer modes  two players may co operatively play through the game s campaign  17 Halo s multiplayer components were generally well received by critics and is widely considered one of the best multiplayer games of all time  18  31  32  Although the Xbox version of Halo lacks official support for online multiplayer play  XLink Kai  GameSpy and XBConnect s packet tunnelling software provide unofficial ways around this limitation  33  The Windows and Macintosh ports of Halo support online matches involving up to 16 players and include multiplayer maps not in the original Xbox release  34  However  co operative play was removed from the ports because it would have required large amounts of recoding to implement  35  On March 15  2004  Gearbox Software released Halo  Custom Edition for Windows  which enabled players to use custom made maps and game modifications  36   edit  Plot  edit  Setting Halo  Combat Evolved takes place in a science fiction universe created by Bungie Studios specifically for the game  According to the story  the overpopulation of Earth and the realization of faster than light travel have caused the human race to colonize other planets  A keystone of these efforts is the planet Reach  an interstellar naval yard and a hub of scientific and military activity  19  A secret military endeavor  dubbed the SPARTAN Project  was established on Reach to create an army of biologically engineered  cyborg  super soldiers   Twenty seven years before the beginning of the game  a technologically advanced collective of alien races  the Covenant  began to attack human settlements  declaring humanity an affront to their gods  The United Nations Space Command experienced a series of crushing defeats  and  although the super soldiers of the SPARTAN II Project fought effectively against the Covenant  they were too few in numbers to turn the tides of war  19  To prepare for a mission to discover the location of the Covenant s homeworld  SPARTAN II soldiers were recalled to Reach for armor upgrades  Two days before the mission was to begin  Covenant forces attacked Reach and destroyed the colony  19  A starship  the Pillar of Autumn  survived the onslaught with the lead SPARTAN II  Master Chief  onboard  The ship initiated a random jump to slipspace  similar to hyperspace   37  hoping to lead the enemy away from Earth  38  The game starts with the Pillar of Autumn encountering Halo  19  The titular Halo is an enormous  ring shaped artificial space habitat planet  which  according to Bungie Studios  has a diameter of ten thousand kilometers  39  Halo sits at a Lagrange point between a planet and its moon  Centrifugal force created by the rotation of the station provides the ring s gravity  40   edit  Characters Main article  Characters of Halo The player character is Master Chief Petty Officer John 117  41  one of the few  see Halo  The Fall of Reach and its sequels for more information  surviving super soldiers of the SPARTAN II project  and the main character of the story  Accompanying the Master Chief is the Pillar of Autumn s feminine artificial intelligence construct  Cortana  who resides in a neural implant connected to his battle armor  codenamed MJOLNIR Mark V  The Pillar of Autumn s captain  Jacob Keyes  is also a major character  with Staff Sergeant Avery Junior Johnson as a supporting character  Playing a mainly antagonistic role in the game s events is 343 Guilty Spark  an eccentric artificial intelligence responsible for monitoring and maintaining Halo s systems   edit  Story Beginning immediately after the events of Halo  Reach  the game opens as the Pillar of Autumn exits slipspace near a mysterious ring shaped space station  called  Halo  by the enemy of the game  the Covenant  42  A Covenant fleet attacks and heavily damages the Pillar of Autumn  Captain Keyes initiates  The Cole Protocol   43  a procedure designed to prevent the Covenant from learning the location of Earth  While Keyes prepares to land the ship on Halo  the Master Chief and Cortana escape via an escape pod  which crash lands on the ring  Cortana and the Chief are the only ones who survive the impact of the escape pod crash  Keyes survives the Autumn s crash landing  but is captured by the Covenant  44  In the second and third levels of the game  the Master Chief and Cortana gather human survivors and rescue Captain Keyes  who is imprisoned aboard the Covenant ship Truth and Reconciliation  Once rescued  Keyes orders the Master Chief to beat the Covenant to Halo s control center and to discover its purpose  45  The Master Chief and Cortana travel to a map room called the Silent Cartographer  which leads them to the control room  46  There  Cortana enters the systems and  discovering something urgent  suddenly sends the Master Chief to find Captain Keyes while she stays behind  47  While searching for his commander  the Master Chief learns that the Covenant have accidentally released the Flood  a parasitic alien race capable of spreading itself by overwhelming and infesting other sentient life forms  Keyes falls victim to them while looking for a cache of weapons  The release of the Flood prompts Halo s AI monitor  343 Guilty Spark  to recruit the Master Chief in retrieving the Index  a device that will activate Halo and prevent the Flood from spreading beyond the facility  After the Master Chief retrieves and prepares to use the Index  Cortana re appears and warns him against the activation  She has discovered that Halo s defense system is a weapon designed to kill all sentient life in the galaxy  which the Flood requires to spread  48  a revelation which Guilty Spark confirms  49  Faced with this information  the Master Chief and Cortana decide to destroy Halo to prevent its activation  While fighting the Flood  the Covenant  and Guilty Spark s Sentinels  Cortana discovers that the best way to accomplish this is to cause the crashed Pillar of Autumn to self destruct  50  However  Captain Keyes  authorization is required to destroy the Autumn  51  forcing the Chief and Cortana to return to the now Flood infested Truth and Reconciliation to search for him  By the time that they reach Keyes  however  he has been infected beyond the point of no return by the Flood  The Master Chief retrieves Keyes  neural implants directly from his brain and retreats to the Autumn  where Cortana activates the ship s self destruct sequence  However  343 Guilty Spark reappears and deactivates the countdown  discovering the record of human history in the process  52  The Master Chief manually destabilizes the Pillar of Autumn s fusion reactors  and he and Cortana narrowly escape the destruction of the ring via a fighter   edit  Cast Steve Downes as the Master Chief Jen Taylor as Cortana Pete Stacker as Captain Keyes David

amp  Expo  Steve Jobs announced that Halo would be released for Mac OS and Windows simultaneously  54  Before this public announcement  game industry journalists under a non disclosure agreement had previewed the game in a private showing during E3 1999  55  and were reportedly amazed  54  55  Bungie Studios later stated an even earlier development build of the game centered on real time strategy and was  basically Myth in a sci fi universe   56  At E3 2000  the first trailer of Halo was well received  57  The version shown there differed greatly from the one exhibited previously  marking the first major overhaul in the game s development  58  At this point  Halo was a third person action game  in which a transport starship crashlands on a mysterious ring world that orbits a star  Early versions of Covenant aliens appear in great numbers and loot what they can  and war erupts between them and the humans  Unable to match the technologically advanced alien race  the humans on the ring world resort to guerrilla warfare  59  This version of the game featured Halo specific fauna  which were later dropped because of design difficulties and the creatures   detract ion  from the surprise  drama and impact of the Flood   60  As rumors had predicted  61 Microsoft announced on June 19  2000 that it had acquired Bungie Studios  62 Halo became an exclusive game for Microsoft s Xbox video game console  and Bungie Studios rewrote the game s engine  heavily altering its presentation and turning it into a first person shooter  63  Originally a key element  the game s online multiplayer component was dropped because Xbox Live would be unfinished at the time of Halo s release  While a playable demonstration of the game at Gamestock 2001 was well received  64  critics had mixed reactions to its exhibition at E3 2001  65  66  67  The game was released in North America simultaneously with the Xbox  on November 15  2001  1  the  Combat Evolved  subtitle was an addition by marketers at Microsoft  who felt that Halo alone was not a descriptive enough title to compete with other military themed games  68  On July 12  2002  a Halo port for Windows was announced to be under development by Gearbox Software  69  Its showing at E3 2003 was positively received by some critics  70  71  with skepticism by others  72  It was released on September 30  2003  2  and included support for online multiplayer play and featured sharper graphics  but had compatibility issues that caused poor performance  34  73 Halo was later released for Mac OS X on December 11  2003  3  On December 4  2007  the game became available for the Xbox 360 via download from the Xbox Live Marketplace for 1200 Microsoft Points  74   edit  Audio Main article  Halo Original Soundtrack Halo s soundtrack was created by Bungie Studios  audio director  Martin O Donnell  and received enthusiastic praise from many critics  10  18  20  21  O Donnell has stated that his goal was to provide  a feeling of importance  weight  and sense of the  ancient    75  He designed the music so that it  could be dissembled and remixed in such a way that would give  him  multiple  interchangeable loops that could be randomly recombined in order to keep the piece interesting as well as a variable length   Development involved the creation of  alternative middle sections that could be transitioned to if the game called for such a change  i e  less or more intense    76  O Donnell has remarked that he  sat with the level designers and  spotted  the level as though it was a movie  with the knowledge that the music would have to be malleable rather than static      T he level designer would tell me what he hoped a player would feel at certain points or after accomplishing certain tasks   Based on this information  O Donnell would  go back and develop appropriate music cues  then have the designer script the cues into the level  and then we d play through it to see if it worked as desired   76  He explained that the use of music in Halo is sparse because he believes that   music  is best used in a game to quicken the emotional state of the player and it works best when used least   and that   if  music is constantly playing it tends to become sonic wallpaper and loses its impact when it is needed to truly enhance some dramatic component of game play   77   edit  Reception  Reception

sales records  by April 8  2002  one million units had been sold  this pace was faster than that of any previous sixth generation console game  82  During the two months following Halo s release  the game sold alongside more than fifty percent of Xbox consoles  83 Halo s retail price remained at US 49 99 until November 30  2003  84  By July 14  2003  the game had sold three million copies

an overall score of 97  on Metacritic  1 Electronic Gaming Monthly observed   This game has me totally mesmerized      It  engages your intellect on a whole different level   7 Edge praised the game as  the most important launch game for any console  ever  and commented   GoldenEye 007 was the multiplayer standard for console first person shooters    It has been surpassed   32 GameSpot claimed that  Halo s single player game is worth picking up an Xbox for alone   concluding   Not only is this easily the best of the Xbox launch games  but it s easily one of the best shooters ever  on any platform   20 IGN remarked similarly  calling Halo a  can t miss  no brainer  sure thing  five star  triple A game   18  Among the specific aspects that reviewers praised were the balance of weapons  the role of drivable vehicles  3  18  and the artificial intelligence of enemies  3  32  The game received numerous Game of the Year awards  including those of the Academy of Interactive Arts  amp  Sciences  87 Electronic Gaming Monthly  Edge  and IGN  88  The British Academy of Film and Television Arts awarded Halo  Best Console Game   and Rolling Stone presented it with their  Best Original Soundtrack  award  According to Xbox com  the game received a total of 48 awards  88  Although Halo s overall reception was largely positive  the game received criticism for its level design  GameSpy commented   you ll trudge through countless hallways and control rooms that all look exactly the same  fighting identical looking groups of enemies over and over and over it is simply frustrating to see a game with such groundbreaking sequences too often degenerate  into  this kind of mindless  repetitive action   10  Similarly  an article on Game Studies org remarked   In the latter part of the game  the scenarios rely on repetition and quantity rather than innovativeness and quality   89 Eurogamer concluded   Halo is very much a game of two halves  The first half is fast  exciting  beautifully designed and constantly full of surprises  The second half is festooned with gobsmacking plot twists and great cinematics but let down by repetitive paint by numbers level design   80 Halo was released prior to the launch of Xbox Live  and the lack of both online multiplayer and bots to simulate human players was criticised by GameSpy  10  in 2003 GameSpy included Halo in a list of  Top 25 Most Overrated Games of All Time   33  Halo s PC port garnered mixed reactions and received a score of 83  on Metacritic  2  GameSpot stated that it was  still an incredible action game      and  a true classic   awarding it 9 0 out of 10  73  It received a score of 8 2 out of 10 from IGN  who stated   If you ve played the game on the Xbox  there s not much for you here   34  Eurogamer called the game  a missed opportunity   but stated that the online multiplayer component was  a massive draw     for Halo veterans   35   edit  Legacy According to Gamespot  Halo s  numerous subtle innovations have been borrowed by countless other games since   90  The game is often cited as the main reason for the Xbox s success  91  and it began what is commonly regarded as the system s flagship franchise  92  Game designer Vox Day credited the game with using science fiction environments to follow Half Life in eschewing static levels and a similarity to dungeon crawls  which the FPS genre inherited from Akalabeth  Day further wrote that Halo spurred a sustained trend of many other FPS console games  93  In July 2006  Next Gen biz published an article estimating Halo as the second highest revenue generating twenty first century console video game in the United States  behind Grand Theft Auto  Vice City  94  The game s popularity sparked the usage of terms like  Halo clone  95  96  97  and  Halo killer   14  The Halo engine has been used for the game Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse  98  Halo has been featured at both Major League Gaming and the World Cyber Games

site  Good news is the Captain s still alive  The bad news is that the Covenant have captured all of the surviving men  Let s hurry and find the final lifeboat so we can link up with the rest of the survivors     Bungie  Halo  Combat Evolved   Microsoft Game Studios   Xbox  Level area  The Truth and Reconciliation   2001   Cortana  According to the data in their networks  the ring has some kind of deep religious significance  If I m analyzing this correctly  they believe that Halo is some kind of weapon   one with vast  unimaginable power    Keyes  And it s true  The Covenant kept saying that whoever controls Halo controls the fate of the universe    Cortana  Now I see  I have intercepted a number of messages about a Covenant search team scouting for a control room  I thought they were looking for the bridge of a cruiser that I damaged during the battle above the ring  but they must be looking for Halo s control room    Keyes  That s bad news  If Halo is a weapon  and the Covenant gain control of it  they ll use it against us and wipe out the entire human race  Chief  Cortana  I have a new mission for you  We need to beat the Covenant to Halo s control room  Marines  let s move     Bungie  Halo  Combat Evolved   Microsoft Game Studios   Xbox   2001   Cortana  The Covenant believe that what they call the  Silent Cartographer  is somewhere under this island  The Cartographer is a map room that will lead us to Halo s control center     Bungie  Halo  Combat Evolved   Microsoft Game Studios   Xbox   2001   Master Chief  So  what sort of weapon is it    Cortana  What are you talking about  Master Chief  Let s stay focused  Halo  how do we use it against the Covenant    Cortana  This ring isn t a cudgel  you barbarian  It s something else  Something much more important  The Covenant were right  This ring  it s Forerunner  Give me a second to access    yes  the Forerunners built this place  what they called a fortress world  in order to Wait    No  that can t be  Oh  those Covenant fools  They must have known  There must have been signs    Master Chief  Slow down  You re losing me    Cortana  The Covenant    found something buried in this ring  something horrible  And now they re afraid  Master Chief  Something buried  Where    Cortana  The Captain  We ve got to stop the Captain    Master Chief  Keyes  What do we      Cortana  The weapons cache he s

you  Why the Forerunners built it  Halo doesn t kill Flood  it kills their food  Humans  Covenant  whatever  we re all equally edible  The only way to stop the Flood is to starve them to death  and that s exactly what Halo is designed to do wipe the galaxy clean of all sentient life  You don t believe me  Ask him     Bungie  Halo  Combat Evolved   Microsoft Game Studios   Xbox   2001   Master Chief  Is it true    343 Guilty Spark  More or less  Technically  this installation s pulse has a maximum effective radius of twenty five thousand light years  but once the others follow suit  this galaxy will be quite devoid of life  or any least any life with sufficient biomass to sustain the Flood    but you already knew that  I mean  how couldn t you     Bungie  Halo  Combat Evolved   Microsoft Game Studios   Xbox   2001   Cortana  We can t let the monitor activate Halo  We have to stop him we have to destroy Halo  According to my analysis of the available data  I believe the best course of action is somewhat risky  An explosion of sufficient size will help destabilize the ring and will cut through a number of primary systems  We need to trigger a detonation on a large scale  however  A starship s fusion reactors going critical would do the job  I m going to search what s left of the Covenant battle net  and see if I can locate the Pillar of Autumn s crash site  If the ship s fusion reactors are still relatively intact  we can use them to destroy Halo     Bungie  Halo  Combat Evolved   Microsoft Game Studios   Xbox   2001   Cortana  I ve located the Pillar of Autumn  She put down twelve hundred kilometers upspin  Energy readings show her fusion reactors are still powered up  The systems on the Pillar of Autumn have fail safes even I can t override without authorization from the Captain  We ll need to find him  or his neural implants  to start the fusion core detonation     Bungie  Halo  Combat Evolved   Microsoft Game Studios   Xbox   2001   Cortana  This won t take long     There  That should give us enough time to make it to a lifeboat and put some distance between ourselves and Halo before the detonation    343 Guilty Spark  I m afraid that s out of the question  really    Cortana  Oh  hell    343 Guilty Spark  Ridiculous that you and a warship s AI with such a wealth of knowledge     Weren t you worried it might be captured  or destroyed    Cortana  He s in my data arrays a local tap    343 Guilty Spark  You can t imagine how exciting this is to have a record of all our lost time  Human history is it  Fascinating    343 Guilty Spark  Oh  how will I enjoy every moment of its categorization  To think that you would destroy this installation  as well as this record  I am shocked  Almost too shocked for words    Cortana  He stopped
