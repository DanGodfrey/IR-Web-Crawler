African American Civil Rights Movement  1955 1968  refers to the movements in the United States aimed at outlawing racial discrimination against African Americans and restoring voting rights to them  This article covers the phase of the movement between 1955 and 1968  particularly in the South  The emergence of the Black Power Movement  which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975  enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity  economic and political self sufficiency  and freedom from oppression by white Americans  The movement was characterized by major campaigns of civil resistance  Between 1955 and 1968  acts of nonviolent protest and civil disobedience produced crisis situations between activists and government authorities  Federal  state  and local governments  businesses  and communities often had to respond immediately to these situations that highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans  Forms of protest and or civil disobedience included boycotts such as the successful Montgomery Bus Boycott  1955 1956  in Alabama   sit ins  such as the influential Greensboro sit ins  1960  in North Carolina  marches  such as the Selma to Montgomery marches  1965  in Alabama  and a wide range of other nonviolent activities  Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of Civil Rights Act of 1964  1  that banned discrimination based on  race  color  religion  or national origin  in employment practices and public accommodations  the Voting Rights Act of 1965  that restored and protected voting rights  the Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965  that dramatically opened entry to the U S  to immigrants other than traditional European groups  and the Fair Housing Act of 1968  that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing  African Americans re entered politics in the South  and across the country young people were inspired to action  Contents 1 Background 2 Mass

intimidation and violence in the elections  Systematic disfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states from 1890 to 1908 and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid 1960s  For more than 60 years  for example  blacks in the South were not able to elect anyone to represent their interests in Congress or local government  2  During this period  the white dominated Democratic Party regained political control over the South  The Republican Party the  party of Lincoln  which had been the party that most blacks belonged to  shrank to insignificance as black voter registration was suppressed  By the early 20th century  almost all elected officials in the South were Democrats  citation needed  During the same time as African Americans were being disfranchised  white Democrats imposed racial segregation by law  Violence against blacks increased  The system of overt  state sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post Reconstruction South became known as the  Jim Crow  system  It remained virtually intact into the early 1950s  Thus  the early 20th century is a period often referred to as the  nadir of American race relations   While problems and civil rights violations were most intense in the South  social tensions affected African Americans in other regions as well  3  Characteristics of the post Reconstruction period  Racial segregation  By law  4  public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate  white  and  colored  domains  Characteristically  those for colored were underfunded and of inferior quality  Disfranchisement  When white Democrats regained power  they passed laws that made voter registration more inaccessible to blacks  Black voters were forced off the voting rolls  The number of African American voters dropped dramatically  and they no longer were able to elect representatives  From 1890 to 1908  Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised tens of thousands of African Americans  Exploitation  Increased economic oppression of blacks  Latinos  and Asians  denial of economic opportunities  and widespread employment discrimination  Violence  Individual  police  organizational  and mass racial violence against blacks  and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California   African Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime  They resisted it in numerous ways and sought better opportunities through lawsuits  new organizations  political redress  and labor organizing  see the African American Civil Rights Movement  1896 1954    The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  NAACP  was founded in 1909  It fought to end race discrimination through litigation  education  and lobbying efforts  Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision Brown v  Board of Education  1954  that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the  separate but equal  doctrine established in Plessy v  Ferguson  The situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better  in most states they could vote and have their children educated  though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs   From 1910 to 1970  African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west  A total of nearly seven million blacks left the South in what was known as the Great Migration  Invigorated by the victory of Brown and frustrated by the lack of immediate practical effect  private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist  legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about desegregation  They were faced with  massive resistance  in the South by proponents of racial segregation and voter suppression  In defiance  African Americans adopted a combined strategy of direct action with nonviolent resistance known as civil disobedience  giving rise to the African American Civil Rights Movement of 1955 1968  Mass action replacing litigation The strategy of public education  legislative lobbying  and litigation in the court system that typified the Civil Rights Movement in the first half of the 20th Century broadened after Brown to a strategy that emphasized  direct action  primarily boycotts  sit ins  Freedom Rides  marches and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization  nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience  This mass action approach typified the movement from 1960 to 1968  Churches  the centers of their communities  local grassroots organizations  fraternal societies  and black owned businesses  mobilized volunteers to participate in broad based actions  This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges  In 1952  the Regional Council of Negro Leadership  RCNL   led by T  R  M  Howard  a black surgeon  entrepreneur  and planter  organized a successful boycott of gas stations in Mississippi that refused to provide restrooms for blacks  Through the RCNL  Howard led campaigns to expose brutality by the Mississippi state highway patrol and to encourage blacks to make deposits in the black owned Tri State Bank of Nashville which  in turn  gave loans to civil rights activists who were victims of a  credit squeeze  by the White Citizens  Councils  5  The Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the Montgomery Bus Boycott managed to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses  The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr  a nationally known figure  It also inspired other bus boycotts  such as the highly successful Tallahassee  Florida  boycott of 1956 1957  6  In 1957 Dr  King and Rev  John Duffy  the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association  joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts  such as Rev  C  K  Steele of Tallahassee and Rev  T  J  Jemison of Baton Rouge  and other activists such as Rev  Fred Shuttlesworth  Ella Baker  A  Philip Randolph  Bayard Rustin and Stanley Levison  to form the Southern Christian Leadership Conference  The SCLC  with its headquarters in Atlanta  Georgia  did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did  It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation  The headquarters organization raised funds  mostly from Northern sources  to support such campaigns  It made non violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism  In 1959  Septima Clarke  Bernice Robinson  and Esau Jenkins  with the help of the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee  began the first Citizenship Schools in South Carolina s Sea Islands  They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests  The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on Johns Island  SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere  Key events Main article  Timeline of the African American Civil Rights Movement Brown v  Board of Education  1954 Main article  Brown v  Board of Education Spring 1951 was the year in which great turmoil was felt amongst Black students in reference to Virginia state s educational system  At the time in Prince Edward County  Moton High School was segregated and students had decided to take matters into their own hands to fight against two things  the overpopulated school premises and the unsuitable conditions in their school  This particular behavior coming from Black people in the South was most likely unexpected and inappropriate as White people had expectations for Blacks to act in a subordinate manner  Moreover  some local leaders of the NAACP had tried to persuade the students to back down from their protest against the Jim Crow laws of school segregation  When the students did not accept the NAACP s demands  the NAACP automatically joined them in their battle against school segregation  This became one of the five cases that made up what is known today as Brown v  Board of Education  7  School integration  Barnard School  Washington  D C   1955 On May 17  1954  the U S  Supreme Court handed down its decision regarding the case called Brown v  Board of Education of Topeka  Kansas  in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional  The opinion of the Court stated that the  segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children  The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law  for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group   The lawyers from the NAACP had to gather some plausible evidence in order to win the case of Brown vs  Education  Their way of addressing the issue of school segregation was to enumerate several arguments  One of them pertained to having an exposure to interracial contact in a school environment  It was said that it would  in turn  help to prevent children to live with the pressures that society exerts in regards to race  Therefore  having a better chance of living in democracy  In addition  another was in reference to the emphasis of how   education  comprehends the entire process of developing and training the mental  physical and moral powers and capabilities of human beings   8  In Goluboff s book  it has been stated that the goals of the NAACP was to bring to the Court s awareness the fact that African American children were the victims of the legalization of school segregation and were not guaranteed a bright future  Without having the opportunity to be exposed to other cultures  it impedes on how Black children will function later on as adults trying to live a normal life  The Court ruled that both Plessy v  Ferguson  1896   which had established the segregationist   separate but equal  standard in general  and Cumming v  Richmond County Board of Education  1899   which had applied that standard to schools  were unconstitutional  The following year  in the case known as Brown v  Board of Education  the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time   with all deliberate speed   9 Brown v  Board of Education of Topeka  Kansas  1954  did not overturn Plessy v  Ferguson  1896   Plessy v  Ferguson was segregation based on transportation  Brown v  Board of Education dealt with segregation in education  Brown v  Board of Education did set in motion the future overturning of  separate but equal   On May 18  1954 Greensboro became the first city in the South to publicly announce that it would abide by the U S  Supreme Court s Brown v  Board of Education ruling which declared racial segregation in the nation s public schools unconstitutional   It is unthinkable   remarked School Board Superintendent Benjamin Smith   that we will try to  override  the laws of the United States   In agreement with Smith s position  the school board voted six to one to support the court s ruling  This positive reception for Brown  together with the appointment of African American Dr  David Jones to the school board in 1953  convinced numerous white and black citizens that Greensboro was heading in a forward direction and would likely emerge as a leader in school integration  Integration in Greensboro occurred rather peacefully compared to that of other Southern states such as Alabama  Arkansas  and Virginia where  massive resistance  took hold  10  Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott  1955 1956 Main articles  Rosa Parks and Montgomery Bus Boycott On December 1  1955  Rosa Parks  the  mother of the Civil Rights Movement   refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger  She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the Highlander Center in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed  Parks was arrested  tried  and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance  After word of this incident reached the black community  50 African American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to demand a more humane bus transportation system  However  after many reforms were rejected  the NAACP  led by E D  Nixon  pushed for full desegregation of public buses  With the support of most of Montgomery s 50 000 African Americans  the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African Americans and whites on public buses was lifted  Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery partook in the boycotts  which reduced bus revenue by 80  until a federal court ordered Montgomery s buses desegregated in November 1956  and the boycott ended  11  A young Baptist minister named Martin Luther King  Jr  was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association  the organization that directed the boycott  The protest made King a national figure  His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South  Desegregating Little Rock  1957 Main article  Little Rock Nine Troops from the 327th Regiment  101st Airborne escorting the Little Rock Nine African American students up the steps of Central High  Little Rock  Arkansas  was in a relatively progressive Southern state  A crisis erupted  however  when Governor of Arkansas Orval Faubus called out the National Guard on September 4 to prevent entry to the nine African American students who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school  Little Rock Central High School  12  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades  On the first day of school  only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school  She was harassed by white protesters outside the school  and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her  Afterward  the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in jeeps  Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist  The Arkansas Democratic Party  which then controlled politics in the state  put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the Brown decision  Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it  Faubus  order received the attention of President Dwight D  Eisenhower  who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts  Critics had charged he was lukewarm  at best  on the goal of desegregation of public schools  Eisenhower federalized the National Guard and ordered them to return to their barracks  Eisenhower then deployed elements of the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock to protect the students  The students were able to attend high school  They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting  jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day  and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year  Although federal troops escorted the students between classes  the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers were not around  One of the Little Rock Nine  Minnijean Brown  was suspended for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line  Later  she was expelled for verbally abusing a white female student  13  Only one of the Little Rock Nine  Ernest Green  got the chance to graduate  after the 1957 58 school year was over  the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate  Other school systems across the South followed suit  Sit ins  1960 The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit in at a Woolworth s store in Greensboro  North Carolina  14  On February 1  1960  four students Ezell A  Blair  Jr   now known as Jibreel Khazan   David Richmond  Joseph McNeil  and Franklin McCain from North Carolina Agricultural  amp  Technical College  an all black college  sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth s policy of excluding African Americans  15  The four students purchased small items in other parts of the store and kept their receipts  then sat down at the lunch counter and asked to be served  After being denied service  they produced their receipts and asked why their money was good everywhere else at the store  but not at the lunch counter  16  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally  to sit quietly  and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in  The sit in soon inspired other sit ins in Richmond  Virginia  17 Nashville  Tennessee  and Atlanta  Georgia  18  19  As students across the south began to  sit in  at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores  local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities  The  sit in  technique was not new as far back as 1939  African American attorney Samuel Wilbert Tucker organized a sit in at the then segregated Alexandria  Virginia library  20  In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement  21  The success of the Greensboro sit in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South  Probably the best organized  most highly disciplined  the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville  Tennessee  22  On March 9  1960 an Atlanta University Center group of students released An Appeal for Human Rights  23  as a full page advertisement in newspapers  including the Atlanta Constitution  Atlanta Journal  and Atlanta Daily World  24  This student group  known as the Committee on the Appeal for Human Rights  COAHR   initiated the Atlanta Student Movement  25  and began to lead in Atlanta  26  with sit ins starting on March 15  1960  19  By the end of 1960  the sit ins had spread to every southern and border state and even to Nevada  Illinois  and Ohio  Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks  beaches  libraries  theaters  museums  and other public places  Upon being arrested  student demonstrators made  jail no bail  pledges  to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest  thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food  In April  1960 activists who had led these sit ins held a conference at Shaw University in Raleigh  North Carolina that led to the formation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  SNCC   27  SNCC took these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further  to the freedom rides  28  See also  Greensboro sit ins and Nashville sit ins Freedom Rides  1961 Main article  Freedom Rider John Lewis and James Zwerg in 1961 after being beaten by a mob in Montgomery  Alabama during the Freedom Ride  Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v  Virginia   1960  364 U S  that ended segregation for passengers engaged in interstate travel  Organized by CORE  the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D C  on May 4  1961  and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17  29  During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides  activists traveled through the Deep South to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals  including restrooms and water fountains  That proved to be a dangerous mission  In Anniston  Alabama  one bus was firebombed  forcing its passengers to flee for their lives  In Birmingham  Alabama  an FBI informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene  Bull  Connor gave Ku Klux Klan members fifteen minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police  protect  them  The riders were severely beaten  until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them   James Peck  a white activist  was beaten so hard he required fifty stitches to his head  30  Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides  but SNCC activists from Nashville brought in new riders to continue the journey from Birmingham  In Montgomery  Alabama  at the Greyhound Bus Station  a mob charged another bus load of riders  knocking John Lewis unconscious with a crate and smashing Life photographer Don Urbrock in the face with his own camera  A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg  a white student from Fisk University  and beat him in the face with a suitcase  knocking out his teeth  30  On 24 May 1961  the freedom riders continued their rides into Jackson  Mississippi  where they were arrested for  breaching the peace  by using  white only  facilities  New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations  As riders arrived in Jackson  they were arrested  By the end of summer  more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi  29      When the weary Riders arrive in Jackson and attempt to use  white only  restrooms and lunch counters they are immediately arrested for Breach of Peace and Refusal to Obey an Officer  Says  sic  Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett in defense of segregation   The Negro is different because God made him different to punish him   From lockup  the Riders announce  Jail No Bail    they will not pay fines for unconstitutional arrests and illegal convictions   and by staying in jail they keep the issue alive  Each prisoner will remain in jail for 39 days  the maximum time they can serve without loosing  sic  their right to appeal the unconstitutionality of their arrests  trials  and convictions  After 39 days  they file an appeal and post bond     31  The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly  crammed into tiny  filthy cells and sporadically beaten  In Jackson  Mississippi  some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100 degree heat  Others were transferred to Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman  where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed  Sometimes the men were suspended by  wrist breakers  from the walls  Typically  the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days  making it hard for them to breathe  Public sympathy and support for the freedom riders led the Kennedy administration to order the Interstate Commerce Commission  ICC  to issue a new desegregation order  When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1  passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus   white  and  colored  signs came down in the terminals  separate drinking fountains  toilets  and waiting rooms were consolidated  and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color  The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis  a single minded activist  James Lawson  the revered  guru  of nonviolent theory and tactics  Diane Nash  an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice  Bob Moses  pioneer of voting registration in Mississippi  and James Bevel  a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator  Other prominent student activists included Charles McDew  Bernard Lafayette  Charles Jones  Lonnie King  Julian Bond  Hosea Williams  and Stokely Carmichael  Voter registration organizing After the Freedom Rides  local black leaders in Mississippi such as Amzie Moore  Aaron Henry  Medgar Evers  and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and to build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state  Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890  with provisions such as poll taxes  residency requirements  and literacy tests  it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the polls  After so many years  the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy  In the fall of 1961  SNCC organizer Robert Moses began the first such project in McComb and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state  Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen  White Citizens  Council  and Ku Klux Klan resulting in beatings  hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee  32  White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state s civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success  In February 1962  representatives of SNCC  CORE  and the NAACP formed the Council of Federated Organizations  COFO   At a subsequent meeting in August  SCLC became part of COFO  33  In the Spring of 1962  with funds from the Voter Education Project  SNCC COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around Greenwood  and the areas surrounding Hattiesburg  Laurel  and Holly Springs  As in McComb  their efforts were met with fierce opposition arrests  beatings  shootings  arson  and murder  Registrars used the literacy test to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that even highly educated people could not meet  In addition  employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes  34  Over the following years  the black voter registration campaign spread across the state  Similar voter registration campaigns with similar responses were begun by SNCC  CORE  and SCLC in Louisiana  Alabama  southwest Georgia  and South Carolina  By 1963  voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts  After passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  1  protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement  It resulted in passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965  Integration of Mississippi universities  1956 1965 This section contains weasel words  vague phrasing that often accompanies biased or unverifiable information  Such statements should be clarified or removed   May 2010  James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U S  marshals Beginning in 1956  Clyde Kennard  a black Korean War veteran  tried to enroll at Mississippi Southern College  now the University of Southern Mississippi  under the GI Bill at Hattiesburg  Dr  William David McCain  the college president  tried to prevent his enrollment by appealing to local black leaders and the segregationist state political establishment  He used the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission  of which he was a member  It was a state funded organization that tried to counter the civil rights movement by positively portraying segregationist policies  More significantly  it collected data on activists  harassed them legally  and used economic boycotts against them by threatening their jobs  or causing them to lose their jobs  to try to suppress their work  Kennard was twice arrested on trumped up charges  and eventually convicted and sentenced to seven years in the state prison  35  After three years at hard labor  Kennard was paroled by Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett  Journalists had investigated his case and publicized the state s mistreatment of his colon cancer  35  McCain s role in Kennard s arrests and convictions is unknown  36  37  38  39  While trying to prevent Kennard s enrollment  McCain made a speech in Chicago  with his travel sponsored by the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission  He described the blacks  seeking to desegregate Southern schools as  imports  from the North   Kennard was a native and resident of Hattiesburg    We insist that educationally and socially  we maintain a segregated society      In all fairness  I admit that we are not encouraging Negro voting   he said   The Negroes prefer that control of the government remain in the white man s hands   36  38  39  Note  Mississippi had passed a new constitution in 1890 that effectively disfranchised most blacks by changing electoral and voter registration requirements  although it deprived them of constitutional rights authorized under post Civil War amendments  it survived US Supreme Court challenges at the time  It was not until after passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that most blacks in Mississippi and other southern states gained federal protection to enforce their right to vote  In September 1962  James Meredith won a lawsuit to secure admission to the previously segregated University of Mississippi  He attempted to enter campus on September 20  on September 25  and again on September 26  He was blocked by Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett  who said    N o school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor   The Fifth U S  Circuit Court of Appeals held Barnett and Lieutenant Governor Paul B  Johnson  Jr  in contempt  with fines of more than  10 000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll  Attorney General Robert Kennedy sent in a force of U S  Marshals  On September 30  1962  Meredith entered the campus under their escort  Students and other whites began rioting that evening  throwing rocks and then firing on the U S  Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall  Two people  including a French journalist  were killed  28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds  and 160 others were injured  After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus  President John F  Kennedy sent regular US Army forces to the campus to quell the riot  Meredith began classes the day after the troops arrived  40  Kennard and other activists continued to work on public university desegregation  In 1965 Raylawni Branch and Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong became the first African American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi  By that time  McCain helped ensure they had a peaceful entry  41  In 2006  Judge Robert Helfrich ruled that Kennard was factually innocent of all charges for which he had been convicted in the 1950s  35  Albany Movement  1961 1962 Main article  Albany Movement The SCLC  which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides  committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in Albany  Georgia  in November 1961  King  who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers faced and given the derisive nickname  De Lawd  as a result intervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders  The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett  the local police chief  and divisions within the black community  The goals may not have been specific enough  Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion  He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities  allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail  Prichett also foresaw King s presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King s rallying the black community  King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories  The local movement  however  continued the struggle  and it obtained significant gains in the next few years  42  Birmingham Campaign  1963 1964 Main article  Birmingham Campaign Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the University of Alabama and is confronted by US Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbachat in 1963  The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC  however  when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963  Executive Director Wyatt Tee Walker carefully planned strategy and tactics for the campaign  It focused on one goal the desegregation of Birmingham s downtown merchants  rather than total desegregation  as in Albany  The movement s efforts were helped by the brutal response of local authorities  in particular Eugene  Bull  Connor  the Commissioner of Public Safety  He had long held much political power  but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate  Refusing to accept the new mayor s authority  Connor intended to stay in office  The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation  including sit ins  kneel ins at local churches  and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters  The city  however  obtained an injunction barring all such protests  Convinced that the order was unconstitutional  the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters  King elected to be among those arrested on April 12  1963  43  While in jail  King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail  44  on the margins of a newspaper  since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement  45  Supporters appealed to the Kennedy administration  which intervened to obtain King s release  King was allowed to call his wife  who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child  and was released early on April 19  The campaign  however  was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest  James Bevel  SCLC s Director of Direct Action and Nonviolent Education  came up with a bold and controversial alternative  to train high school students to take part in the demonstrations  As a result  more than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to meet at the 16th Street Baptist Church to join the demonstrations  in what would come to be called the Children s Crusade  More than six hundred ended up in jail  This was newsworthy  but in this first encounter  the police acted with restraint  On the next day  however  another one thousand students gathered at the church  When they started marching  Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them  then turned the city s fire hoses water streams on the children  Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators  Congress of Racial Equality march in Washington DC on 22 September 1963 in memory of the children killed in the Birmingham bombings  Widespread public outrage led the Kennedy administration to intervene more forcefully in negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC  On May 10  the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown  to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices  to arrange for the release of jailed protesters  and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders  Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement  the Rev  Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical  since he was skeptical about the good faith of Birmingham s power structure from his experience in dealing with them  Parts of the white community reacted violently  They bombed the Gaston Motel  which housed the SCLC s unofficial headquarters  and the home of King s brother  the Reverend A  D  King  Kennedy prepared to federalize the Alabama National Guard if the need arose  Four months later  on September 15  a conspiracy of Ku Klux Klan members bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham  killing four young girls  Other events of the summer of 1963  On June 11  1963  George Wallace  Governor of Alabama  tried to block 46  the integration of the University of Alabama  President John F  Kennedy sent a force to make Governor Wallace step aside  allowing the enrollment of two black students  That evening  President Kennedy addressed the nation on TV and radio with his historic civil rights speech  47  The next day  Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi  48  49  The next week  as promised  on June 19  1963  President Kennedy submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress  50  March on Washington  1963 The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the National Mall Main article  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom Civil Rights March on Washington  leaders marching from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial A  Philip Randolph had planned a march on Washington  D C  in 1941 to support demands for elimination of employment discrimination in defense industries  he called off the march when the Roosevelt administration met the demand by issuing Executive Order 8802 barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order  Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march  which they proposed in 1962  The Kennedy administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success  The march was held on August 28  1963  Unlike the planned 1941 march  for which Randolph included only black led organizations in the planning  the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations  the more progressive wing of the labor movement  and other liberal organizations  The march had six official goals  meaningful civil rights laws  a massive federal works program  full and fair employment  decent housing  the right to vote  and adequate integrated education  Of these  the march s major focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham  Martin Luther King  Jr  at a Civil Rights March on Washington  D C  National media attention also greatly contributed to the march s national exposure and probable impact  In his section  The March on Washington and Television News   51 William Thomas notes   Over five hundred cameramen  technicians  and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event  More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last presidential inauguration  One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument  to give dramatic vistas of the marchers   By carrying the organizers  speeches and offering their own commentary  television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event  51   I Have a Dream  30 second

success  although not without controversy  An estimated 200 000 to 300 000 demonstrators gathered in front of the Lincoln Memorial  where King delivered his famous  I Have a Dream  speech  While many speakers applauded the Kennedy administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new  more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation  John Lewis of SNCC took the administration to task for not doing more to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South  After the march  King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the White House  While the Kennedy administration appeared sincerely committed to passing the bill  it was not clear that it had the votes in Congress to do it  However when President Kennedy was assassinated on November 22  1963  50  the new President Lyndon Johnson decided to use his influence in Congress to bring about much of Kennedy s legislative agenda  St  Augustine  Florida  1963 1964 Main article  St  Augustine Movement St  Augustine  on the northeast coast of Florida was famous as the  Nation s Oldest City   founded by the Spanish in 1565  It became the stage for a great drama leading up to the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964  A local movement  led by Dr  Robert B  Hayling  a black dentist and Air Force veteran  had been picketing segregated local institutions since 1963  as a result of which Dr  Hayling and three companions  James Jackson  Clyde Jenkins  and James Hauser  were brutally beaten at a Ku Klux Klan rally in the fall of that year  Nightriders shot into black homes  and teenagers Audrey Nell Edwards  JoeAnn Anderson  Samuel White  and Willie Carl Singleton  who came to be known as  The St  Augustine Four   spent six months in jail and reform school after sitting in at the local Woolworth s lunch counter  It took a special action of the governor and cabinet of Florida to release them after national protests by the Pittsburgh Courier  Jackie Robinson  and others  In 1964  Dr  Hayling and other activists urged the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to come to St  Augustine  The first action came during spring break  when Hayling appealed to northern college students to come to the Ancient City  not to go to the beach  but to take part in demonstrations  Four prominent Massachusetts women Mrs  Mary Parkman Peabody  Mrs  Esther Burgess  Mrs  Hester Campbell  all of whose husbands were Episcopal bishops   and Mrs  Florence Rowe  whose husband was vice president of John Hancock Insurance Company came to lend their support  and the arrest of Mrs  Peabody  the 72 year old mother of the governor of Massachusetts  for attempting to eat at the segregated Ponce de Leon Motor Lodge in an integrated group  made front page news across the country  and brought the civil rights movement in St  Augustine to the attention of the world  Widely publicized activities continued in the ensuing months  as Congress saw the longest filibuster against a civil rights bill in its history  Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr  was arrested at the Monson Motel in St  Augustine on June 11  1964  the only place in Florida he was arrested  He sent a  Letter from the St  Augustine Jail  to a northern supporter  Rabbi Israel Dresner of New Jersey  urging him to recruit others to participate in the movement  This resulted  a week later  in the largest mass arrest of rabbis in American history while conducting a pray in at the Monson  A famous photograph taken in St  Augustine shows the manager of the Monson Motel pouring acid in the swimming pool while blacks and whites are swimming in it  The horrifying photograph was run on the front page of the Washington newspaper the day the senate went to vote on passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964  Mississippi Freedom Summer  1964 Main article  Freedom Summer In the summer of 1964  COFO brought nearly 1 000 activists to Mississippi most of them white college students to join with local black activists to register voters  teach in  Freedom Schools   and organize the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  MFDP   52  Andrew Goodman  James Chaney  and Michael Schwerner Many of Mississippi s white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society  State and local governments  police  the White Citizens  Council and the Ku Klux Klan used arrests  beatings  arson  murder  spying  firing  evictions  and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality  53  On June 21  1964  three civil rights workers disappeared  James Chaney  a young black Mississippian and plasterer s apprentice  and two Jewish activists  Andrew Goodman  a Queens College anthropology student  and Michael Schwerner  a CORE organizer from Manhattan s Lower East Side  were found weeks later  murdered by conspirators who turned out to be local members of the Klan  some of them members of the Neshoba County sheriff s department  This outraged the public  leading the U S  Justice Department along with the FBI  the latter which had previously avoided dealing with the issue of segregation and persecution of blacks  to take action  The outrage over these murders helped lead to the passage of the Civil Rights Act   See Mississippi civil rights workers murders for details   From June to August  Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state  with the largest number concentrated in the Mississippi Delta region  At least 30 Freedom Schools  with close to 3 500 students were established  and 28 community centers set up  54  Over the course of the Summer Project  some 17 000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of the red tape and forces of white supremacy arrayed against them only 1 600  less than 10   succeeded  But more than 80 000 joined the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  MFDP   founded as an alternative political organization  showing their desire to vote and participate in politics  55  Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters  it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement  It helped break down the decades of people s isolation and repression that were the foundation of the Jim Crow system  Before Freedom Summer  the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers  The progression of events throughout the South increased media attention to Mississippi  The deaths of affluent northern white students and threats to other northerners attracted the full attention of the media spotlight to the state  Many black activists became embittered  believing the media valued lives of whites and blacks differently  Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers  almost all of whom black and white still consider it to have been one of the defining periods of their lives  56  Civil Rights Act of 1964 Although President Kennedy had proposed civil rights legislation and it had support from Northern Congressmen  Southern Senators blocked consideration of the bill by threatening filibusters  After considerable parliamentary maneuvering and 54 days of filibuster on the floor of the United States Senate  President Johnson got a bill through the Congress  On July 2  1964  President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964  1  that banned discrimination based on  race  color  religion  sex or national origin  in employment practices and public accommodations  The bill authorized the Attorney General to file lawsuits to enforce the new law  The law also nullified state and local laws that required such discrimination  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  1964 Main article  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party President Lyndon B  Johnson meets with Civil Rights leaders Martin Luther King  Jr   Whitney Young  James Farmer Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 19th century  In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote  More than 80 000 people registered and voted in the mock election  which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the  Freedom Party  against the official state Democratic Party candidates  57  In 1964  organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  MFDP  to challenge the all white official party  When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates  they held their own primary  They selected Fannie Lou Hamer  Annie Devine  and Victoria Gray to run for Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention  52  The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in Atlantic City  New Jersey  was inconvenient  however  for the convention organizers  They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson administration s achievements in civil rights  rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party  All white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated  Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the  Solid South   as well as support that George Wallace had received in the North during the Democratic primaries  Johnson could not  however  prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee  There Fannie Lou Hamer testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote  Turning to the television cameras  Hamer asked   Is this America   Johnson offered the MFDP a  compromise  under which it would receive two non voting  at large seats  while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats  The MFDP angrily rejected the  compromise   The MFDP kept up its agitation at the convention  after it was denied official recognition  When all but three of the  regular  Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party  the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates  National party organizers removed them  When they returned the next day  they found convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before  They stayed and sang  freedom songs   The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement  but it did not destroy the MFDP  The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City  It invited Malcolm X  then a spokesman for the Nation of Islam  to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the war in Vietnam  Dr  King Awarded Nobel Peace Prize On December 10  1964  Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr  was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize  the youngest man to receive the award  he was 35 years of age  58  Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players  January 1965 After the 1964 professional American Football League season  the AFL All Star Game had been scheduled for early 1965 in New Orleans  Tulane Stadium  After numerous black players were refused service by a number of New Orleans hotels and businesses  and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers  black and white players alike lobbied for a boycott of New Orleans  Under the leadership of Buffalo Bills  players  including Cookie Gilchrist  the players put up a unified front  The game was moved to Jeppesen Stadium in Houston  The discriminatory practices that prompted the boycott were illegal under the Civil Rights Act of 1964  1  which had been signed in July 1964  This new law likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause  It was the first boycott by a professional sports event of an entire city  Selma and the Voting Rights Act

marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police  Jimmie Lee Jackson  a resident of nearby Marion  was killed by police at a later march in February 17  1965  Jackson s death prompted James Bevel  director of the Selma Movement  to initiate a plan to march from Selma to Montgomery  the state capital  On March 7  1965  acting on Bevel s plan  Hosea Williams of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles  87 km  from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery  Only six blocks into the march  at the Edmund Pettus Bridge  state troopers and local law enforcement  some mounted on horseback  attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs  tear gas  rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire  and bull whips  They drove the marchers back into Selma  John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety  At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized  Among those gassed and beaten was Amelia Boynton Robinson  who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time  The national broadcast of the news footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers  seeking the right to vote provoked a national response  as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier  The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later  Participants in the Selma to Montgomery marches After a second march

televised address to support the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress  In it he stated  But even if we pass this bill  the battle will not be over  What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America  It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life  Their cause must be our cause too  Because it is not just Negroes  but really it is all of us  who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice  And we shall overcome  Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 on August 6  The 1965 act suspended poll taxes  literacy tests  and other subjective voter tests  It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used  African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts  If voting discrimination occurred  the 1965 act authorized the Attorney General of the United States to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars  Johnson reportedly told associates of his concern that signing the bill had lost the white South as voters for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future  The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans  Within months of its passage  250 000 new black voters had been registered  one third of them by federal examiners  Within four years  voter registration in the South had more than doubled  In 1965  Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout at 74  and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected  In 1969  Tennessee had a 92 1  turnout  Arkansas  77 9   and Texas  73 1   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights

Orangeburg massacre Other issues Avoiding the  Communist  label On 17 December 1951  the Communist Party affiliated Civil Rights Congress delivered the petition We Charge Genocide  The Crime of Government Against the Negro People   often shortened to We Charge Genocide  to the United Nations in 1951  arguing that the U S  federal government  by its failure to act against lynching in the United States  was guilty of genocide under Article II of the UN Genocide Convention  60  The petition was presented to the United Nations at two separate venues  Paul Robeson  concert singer and activist  to a UN official in New York City  while William L  Patterson  executive director of the CRC  delivered copies of the drafted petition to a UN delegation in Paris  Patterson  the editor of the petition  was a leader in the Communist Party USA and head of the International Labor Defense  a group that offered legal representation to communists  trade unionists  and African Americans in cases involving issues of political or racial persecution  As earlier Civil Rights figures like Robeson  Dubois and Patterson became more politically radical  and therefore targets of Cold War anti Communism by the US  Government  they lost favor with both mainstream Black America and the NAACP  In order to secure a place in the mainstream and gain the broadest base  it was a matter of survival for the new generation of civil rights activists to openly distance themselves from anything and anyone Communist associated  Even with this distinction however  many civil rights leaders and organizations were still investigated by the FBI under J Edgar Hoover and labeled  Communist  or  subversive   In the early 1960s  the practice of distancing the Civil Rights Movement from  Reds  was challenged by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee who adopted a policy of accepting assistance and participation by anyone  regardless of political affiliation  who supported the SNCC program and was willing to  put their body on the line   At times this political openness put SNCC at odds with the NAACP  61  Kennedy administration  1961 1963 Robert F  Kennedy speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the Justice Department building  June 1963  During the years preceding his election to the presidency  John F  Kennedy s record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant  Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency  his knowledge of the civil rights movement was  lacking   For the first two years of the Kennedy administration  attitudes to both the president and attorney general  Robert F  Kennedy  were mixed  Many viewed the administration with suspicion  A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom  Still  many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning  Although observers frequently assert the phrase  The Kennedy administration  or even   President Kennedy  when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement  between 1960 and 1963  many of the initiatives were the result of Robert Kennedy s passion  Through his rapid education in the realities of racism citation needed   Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney General  Asked in an interview in May 1962   What do you see as the big problem ahead for you  is it Crime or Internal Security   Robert Kennedy replied   Civil Rights   62  The President came to share his brother s sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney General s insistence that he made his famous address to the nation  63  When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery  Alabama  where King held out with protesters  the Attorney General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U S  Marshals and National Guard could secure the area  King proceeded to berate Kennedy for  allowing the situation to continue   King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy s commanding the force to break up an attack  which might otherwise have ended King s life  The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations  For Dr King  Robert Kennedy initially represented the  softly softly  approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U S  For Robert Kennedy  King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy  Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress  King initially regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies  Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial  It was at Robert Kennedy s constant insistence  through conversations with King and others  that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffrage the need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels  In time the president gained King s respect and trust  via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney General  Robert Kennedy became very much his brother s key advisor on matters of racial equality  The president regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney General s office  With a very small majority in Congress  the president s ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South  Indeed  without the support of Vice President Lyndon Johnson  who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there  many of the Attorney General s programs would not have progressed  By late 1962  frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement s strong support for legislative initiatives  housing rights  administrative representation across all US Government departments  safe conditions at the ballot box  pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals  King remarked by the end of the year   This administration has reached out more

certain  lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues   64  From squaring off against Governor George Wallace  to  tearing into  Vice President Johnson  for failing to desegregate areas of the administration   to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment  to desegregating interstate transport  Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement and later carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968  On the night of Governor Wallace s capitulation  President Kennedy gave an address to the nation  which marked the changing tide  an address that was to become a landmark for the ensuing change in political policy  In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now   We preach freedom around the world  and we mean it  and we cherish our freedom here at home  but are we to say to the world  and much more importantly  to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes  that we have no second class citizens except Negroes  that we have no class or caste system  no ghettoes  no master race except with respect to Negroes  Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise  The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them    President Kennedy   65    Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr  The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F  Kennedy was assassinated  The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on Capitol Hill by the combined efforts of the Kennedy brothers  Dr  King  and other leaders  and President Lyndon Johnson  In 1966  Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti apartheid movement  His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa  Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population  He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state  In an interview with LOOK Magazine he said  At the University of Natal in Durban  I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity  A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be  because God created Negroes to serve   But suppose God is black   I replied   What if we go to Heaven and we  all our lives  have treated the Negro as an inferior  and God is there  and we look up and He is not white  What then is our response   There was no answer  Only silence   Robert Kennedy   LOOK Magazine 66  American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement Many in the Jewish community supported the Civil Rights Movement  In

of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s  67  Jewish leaders were arrested while heeding a call from Rev  Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr  in St  Augustine  Florida  in June 1964  where the largest mass arrest of rabbis in American history took place at the Monson Motor Lodge a nationally important civil rights landmark that was demolished in 2003 so that a Hilton Hotel could be built on the site  Abraham Joshua Heschel  a writer  rabbi and professor of theology at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights  He marched arm in arm with Dr  King in the 1965 March on Selma  In the Mississippi Burning murders of 1964  the two white activists killed  Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner  were both Jewish  Jewish civil rights activist Joseph L  Rauh  Jr  marching with Martin Luther King in 1963 Brandeis University  the only nonsectarian Jewish sponsored college university in the world  created the Transitional Year Program  TYP in 1968  in part response to Rev  Dr  Martin Luther King s assassination  The faculty created it to renew the University s commitment to social justice  Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence  these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience  The program began by admitting 20 black males  As it developed  two groups have been given chances  The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis  For example  their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences  Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools  The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus  energy  and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits  Some have served as heads of their households  others have worked full time while attending high school full time  and others have shown leadership in other ways  The American Jewish Committee  American Jewish Congress  and Anti Defamation League actively promoted civil rights  While Jews were very active in the civil rights movement in the South  in the North  many had experienced a more strained relationship with African Americans  In communities experiencing white flight  racial rioting  and urban decay  Jewish Americans were more often the last remaining whites in the communities most affected  With Black militancy and the Black Power movements on the rise  Black Anti Semitism increased leading to strained relations between Blacks and Jews in Northern communities  In New York City  most notably  there was a major socio economic class difference in the perception of African Americans by Jews  68  Jews from better educated Upper Middle Class backgrounds were often very supportive of African American civil rights activities while the Jews in poorer urban communities that became increasingly minority were often less supportive largely in part due to more negative and violent interactions between the two groups  See also  African American   Jewish relations and Brownsville  Brooklyn Fraying of alliances King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964  when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize  His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges  The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 1  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray  King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson administration  In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam  He moved further left in the following years  speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society  He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement  King s attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful  however  King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination  SCLC s campaign in Chicago publicly failed  as Chicago Mayor Richard J  Daley marginalized SCLC s campaign by promising to  study  the city s problems  In 1966  white demonstrators holding  white power  signs in notoriously racist Cicero  a suburb of Chicago  threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation  Race riots  1963 1970 By the end of World War II  more than half of the country s black population lived in Northern and Western industrial cities rather than Southern rural areas  citation needed  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities  education and to escape legal segregation  African Americans often found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law  While after the 1920s  the Ku Klux Klan was not prevalent  by the 1960s other problems prevailed in northern cities  Beginning in the 1950s  deindustrialization and restructuring of major industries  railroads and meatpacking  steel industry and car industry  markedly reduced working class jobs  which had earlier provided middle class incomes  As the last population to enter the industrial job market  blacks were disadvantaged by its collapse  At the same time  investment in highways and private development of suburbs in the postwar years had drawn many ethnic whites out of the cities to newer housing in expanding suburbs  Urban blacks who did not follow the middle class out of the cities became concentrated in the older housing of inner city neighborhoods  among the poorest in most major cities  Because jobs in new service areas and parts of the economy were being created in suburbs  unemployment was much higher in many black than in white neighborhoods  and crime was frequent  African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived  Many were limited to menial or blue collar jobs  although union organizing in the 1930s and 1940s had opened up good working environments for some  African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned  or poorly maintained public housing  They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had fewer white students than in the decades before WWII  The racial makeup of most major city police departments  largely ethnic white  especially Irish   was a major factor in adding to racial tensions  Even a black neighborhood such as Harlem had a ratio of one black officer for every six white officers  69  The majority black city of Newark  New Jersey had only 145 blacks among its 1322 police officers  70  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics  descendants of 19th century immigrants  mainly Irish  Italian  and Eastern European officers  They had established their own power bases in the police departments and in territories in cities  Some would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation  71  One of the first major race riots took place in Harlem  New York  in the summer of 1964  A white Irish American police officer  Thomas Gilligan  shot 15 year old James Powell  who was black  for allegedly charging him armed with a knife  It was found that Powell was unarmed  A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan s suspension  Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17  1964  the day after Powell s death  72  The police department did not suspend Gilligan  Although the precinct had promoted the NYPD s first black station commander  neighborhood residents were frustrated with racial inequalities  They looted and burned anything that was not black owned in the neighborhood  citation needed Bedford Stuyvesant  a major black neighborhood in Brooklyn erupted next  That summer  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia  for similar reasons  In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964  the federal government funded a pilot program called Project Uplift  Thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965  The project was inspired by a report generated by HARYOU called Youth in the Ghetto  73  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project  together with the National Urban League and nearly 100 smaller community organizations  74  Permanent jobs at living wages were still out of reach of many young black men  Police arrest a man during the Watts Riots  August 1965 In 1965  President Lyndon B  Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act  but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks  A few days after the act became law  a riot broke out in the South Central Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts  Like Harlem  Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment  Its residents were supervised by a largely white police department that had a history of abuse against blacks  While arresting a young man for drunk driving  police officers argued with the suspect s mother before onlookers  The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting  Thirty four people were killed and property valued at about  30 million was destroyed  making the Watts Riots among the worst in American history  With black militancy on the rise  ghetto residents directed acts of anger at the police  Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot  Some young people joined groups such as the Black Panthers  whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers  Riots among blacks occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as Atlanta  San Francisco  Oakland  Baltimore  Seattle  Cleveland  Cincinnati  Columbus  Newark  Chicago  New York City  specifically in Brooklyn  Harlem and the Bronx   and worst of all in Detroit  In Detroit  a comfortable black middle class had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at good paying jobs in the automotive industry  citation needed  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions  subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem  When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons during the hot summer  furious residents rioted  One significant effect of the Detroit riot was the acceleration of  white flight   an ethnic succession by which ethnic white residents  who had become better established economically  moved out of inner city neighborhoods to newer housing in the suburbs  which were first settled by European Americans  or whites  Poorer migrants and immigrants had the older housing in the city  Demonstrating the economic basis of the suburban migration  Detroit lost some of its black middle class as well  as did cities such as Washington  DC and Chicago during the next decades  As a result of suburbanization  the riots  and migration of jobs to the suburbs  formerly prosperous industrial cities  such as Detroit  Newark  and Baltimore  now have less than 40  white population  Newark is close enough to New York to attract new immigrants from Asia and the Middle East as well  Changes in industry caused continued job losses  depopulation of middle classes  and concentrated poverty in such cities in the late 20th century  President Johnson created the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders in 1967  The commission s final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities  It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies  In April 1968 after the assassination of Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr  in Memphis  Tennessee  rioting broke out in cities across the country from frustration and despair  These included Cleveland  Baltimore  Washington  D C   Chicago  New York City and Louisville  Kentucky  As in previous riots  most of the damage was done in black neighborhoods  In some cities  it has taken more than a quarter of a century for these areas to recover from the damage of the riots  in others  little recovery has been achieved  Programs in affirmative action resulted in the hiring of more black police officers in every major city  Today blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore  Washington  New Orleans  Atlanta  Newark  and Detroit  Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination  The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded  but not all the problems have been solved  With industrial and economic restructuring  hundreds of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities  Some moved South  as has much population following new jobs  and others out of the U S  altogether  Civil unrest broke out in Miami in 1980  in Los Angeles in 1992  and in Cincinnati in 2001  See also  Mass racial violence in the United States Black power  1966 Main article  Black Power At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party  he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based  integration and non violence  Stokely Carmichael  who became the leader of SNCC in 1966  was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the  Black Power  movement after he used that slogan  coined by activist and organizer Willie Ricks  in Greenwood  Mississippi on June 17  1966  In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle  He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan  citation needed  Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well  In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity  several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as  Negroes  but as  Afro Americans   Up until the mid 1960s  blacks had dressed similarly to whites and straightened their hair  As a part of gaining a unique identity  blacks started to wear loosely fit dashikis and had started to grow their hair out as a natural afro  The afro  sometimes nicknamed the   fro   remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s  Black Power was made most public  however  by the Black Panther Party  which was founded by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale in Oakland  California  in 1966  This group followed the ideology of Malcolm X  a former member of the Nation of Islam  using a  by any means necessary  approach to stopping inequality  They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of police brutality and created a ten point plan amongst other things  Their dress code consisted of black leather jackets  berets  slacks  and light blue shirts  They wore an afro hairstyle  They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs  referring to police officers as  pigs   displaying shotguns and a raised fist  and often using the statement of  Power to the people   Black Power was taken to another level inside prison walls  In 1966  George Jackson formed the Black Guerrilla Family in the California San Quentin State Prison  The goal of this group was to overthrow the white run government in America and the prison system  In 1970  this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty of shooting and killing three black prisoners from the prison tower  They retaliated by killing a white prison guard   Say It Loud   I m Black and I m Proud  James Brown s  Say It Loud   I m Black and I m Proud  from Say It Loud   I m Black and I m Proud Problems listening to this file  See media help  Released in August 1968  the number one Rhythm  amp  Blues single for the Billboard Year End list was James Brown s  Say It Loud   I m Black and I m Proud   75  In October 1968  Tommie Smith and John Carlos  while being awarded the gold and bronze medals  respectively  at the 1968 Summer Olympics  donned human rights badges and each raised a black gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony  Incidentally  it was the suggestion of white silver medalist  Peter Norman of Australia  for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove  Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the United States Olympic Committee  and later the International Olympic Committee issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two  However  the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live  international television  King was not comfortable with the  Black Power  slogan  which sounded too much like black nationalism to him  SNCC activists  in the meantime  began embracing the  right to self defense  in response to attacks from white authorities  and booed King for continuing to advocate non violence  When King was murdered in 1968  Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground  In every major city from Boston to San Francisco  racial riots broke out in the black community following King s death and as a result   White Flight  occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city  citation needed  Prison reform Gates v  Collier Mississippi State Penitentiary Conditions at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman  then known as Parchman Farm  became part of the public discussion of civil rights after activists were imprisoned there  In the spring of 1961  Freedom Riders came to the South to test the desegregation of public facilities  By the end of June 1963  Freedom Riders had been convicted in Jackson  Mississippi  76  Many were jailed in Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman  Mississippi employed the trusty system  a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates  77  In 1970 the civil rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates  He collected 50 pages of details of murders  rapes  beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary  In a landmark case known as Gates v  Collier  1972   four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the United States Constitution  Federal Judge William C  Keady found in favor of the inmates  writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting cruel and unusual punishment  He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices  Racial segregation of inmates was abolished  And the trustee system  which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others  was also abolished  78  The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady  he wrote that the prison was an affront to  modern standards of decency   Among other reforms  the accommodations were made fit for human habitation  The system of  trusties  was abolished   The prison had armed lifers with rifles and given them authority to oversee and guard other inmates  which led to many abuses and murders   79  In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states  blacks represented a disproportionate number of the prisoners  in excess of their proportion of the general population  They were often treated as second class citizens by white correctional officers  Blacks also represented a disproportionately high number of death row inmates  Eldridge Cleaver s book Soul on Ice was written from his experiences in the California correctional system  it contributed to black militancy  80  Cold War There was an international context for the actions of the U S  Federal government during these years  It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in the Third World  81  In Cold War Civil Rights  Race and the Image of American Democracy  the historian Mary L  Dudziak argued that Communists critical of the United States criticized the nation for its hypocrisy in portraying itself as the  leader of the free world   when so many of its citizens were subjected to severe racial discrimination and violence  She argued that this was a major factor in the government moving to support civil rights legislation  See also  The Communist Party and African Americans Documentary films
