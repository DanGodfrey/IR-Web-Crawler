Edwards Air Force Base Jon Favreau said it was originally his intent to create a film trilogy for Iron Man  7  with Obadiah Stane  Jeff Bridges  becoming Iron Monger during the sequels  After a meeting between Favreau and various comic book writers  including Mark Millar  Stane became the main villain in Iron Man  Millar argued the Mandarin  whom Favreau originally intended to be the main villain  was too fantastical  24  Favreau concurred  deciding   I look at Mandarin more like how in Star Wars you had the Emperor  but Darth Vader is the guy you want to see fight  Then you work your way to the time when lightning bolts are shooting out of the fingers and all that stuff could happen  But you can t have what happened in Return of the Jedi happen in A New Hope  You just can t do it   25  Favreau discussed in interviews how the films  version of Iron Man s comic book nemesis the Mandarin  allows us to incorporate the whole pantheon of villains   He also mentioned that S H I E L D  will continue to have a major role  26  During development  Favreau said the film would explore Stark s alcoholism  but it would not be  the  Demon in a Bottle  version   26  Downey said  while promoting the first film  that Stark would probably develop a drinking problem as he is unable to cope with his age  the effects of revealing he is Iron Man  as well as Pepper getting a boyfriend  27  Before filming began  Downey revealed that while the film was not an adaptation of the   Demon in a Bottle  storyline from the comic book series  it was more about the  interim space  between the origin and the  Demon  story arc  12  Pre production Justin Theroux signed to write the script in July 2008  which is based on a story written by Jon Favreau and Robert Downey  Jr  28  Theroux co wrote Tropic Thunder  and Downey recommended him to Marvel  29 Genndy Tartakovsky storyboarded the film  30 Shane Black gave some advice on the script  and suggested to Favreau and Downey that they model Stark on J  Robert Oppenheimer  who became depressed with being  the destroyer of worlds  after working on the Manhattan Project  27 Adi Granov returned to supervise the designs for Iron Man s armor  26  Filming primarily took place at Raleigh Studios in Manhattan Beach  California  31  Casting Don Cheadle was cast as Rhodes  replacing Terrence Howard from the first film  Howard said   There was no explanation  apparently the contracts that we write and sign aren t worth the paper that they re printed on sometimes  Promises aren t kept  and good faith negotiations aren t always held up   32 Entertainment Weekly stated Favreau did not enjoy working with Howard  often re shooting and cutting his scenes  Howard s publicist said he had a good experience playing the part  while Marvel chose not to comment  As Favreau and Theroux chose to minimize the role  Marvel came to Howard to discuss lowering his salary   Howard was the first actor hired in Iron Man and earned the largest salary of the cast  The publication stated they were unsure whether Howard s representatives left the project first or if Marvel chose to stop negotiating  33  Theroux denied the part of the report stating  the role of War Machine was scaled back and then beefed up   29  Cheadle only had a few hours to accept the role and did not even know what storyline Rhodes would undergo  34  He commented he is a comic book fan  but had not previously participated in comics themed films due to the lack of black superheroes  35  Cheadle said he thought Iron Man was a robot before the first film came out  11  Mickey Rourke was cast as Ivan Vanko  a physicist and ex convict who builds his own arc reactor based weapon to exact vengeance on the Stark family  The character is an amalgamation of Iron Man villains Blacklash  originally known as Whiplash  and the Crimson Dynamo  and is the son of impoverished Soviet physicist Anton Vanko  the original Crimson Dynamo in the comics  36  Downey offered Rourke the part during a roundtable discussion with David Ansen at the 2009 Golden Globes  and Rourke met with Favreau and Theroux to discuss his character s role  Rourke almost dropped out of the role due to Marvel s initial salary offer of  250 000  so the studio chose to increase the deal  37  Rourke researched for the part by visiting Butyrka prison  38  He suggested half of the character s dialogue be in Russian  39  Rourke suggested the addition of tattoos  gold teeth and a fondness for a pet cockatoo  paying for the teeth and bird out of his own money  40  Rourke explained he didn t want to play a  one dimensional bad guy  and wanted to challenge the audience to see something redeemable in him  Not knowing anything about computers himself Rourke described pretending to be tech savvy as the hardest part of the role  11  41  Sam Rockwell was considered for the role of Tony Stark in the first film  and he accepted the role of Hammer without reading the script  42  He had never heard of the character before he was contacted about the part  and was unaware Hammer is an old man in the comics  whereas in the film he is closer to Stark s age  43  Rockwell says his character is  plucky comic relief  but he s got a little bit of an edge   44  Scarlett Johansson was cast as Natalie Rushman   Natasha Romanoff after a scheduling conflict  a previous commitment to Gulliver s Travels forced Emily Blunt to drop out of the part  45  Samuel L  Jackson initially balked at the salary Marvel offered and was unsure about reprising the part of Fury until reaching a deal that would entail his appearance in up to nine films as the character  46  Actress Olivia Munn said she had been given a different part than originally and that reshoots involving her scenes had taken place   Actually  they just gave me another role in the film  I had to re shoot all of my scenes     as they started to edit they realized it was becoming darker than what they d expected and what my scenes had allowed for  My parts were lighthearted and comedic  Jon Favreau called and was like   I ve got good news and bad news  This is what s happening in editing but we all really like you   Marvel and Jon had to add another character from the Marvel universe to keep me included   47  Filming Principal photography began April 6  2009  12  at the Pasadena Masonic Temple  The fake working title was Rasputin  48  Filming also took place at Edwards Air Force Base  49  A post credits scene depicting the discovery of a large hammer was filmed on the set of Thor  and some of it was reused in the film  8  Jon Favreau revealed that the scene was filmed with anamorphic lenses to match Thor  8  Effects The Historic Grand Prix of Monaco action sequence had to be shot in the parking lot of Downey Studios  after permission to film prior to the 2009 Monaco Grand Prix was initially awarded but later retracted by Bernie Ecclestone  citation needed  The filmmakers did ship one Rolls Royce Phantom there  and filmed a track sequence in which race cars were later digitally added  citation needed  Stark s Grand Prix racer was partially based on a 1978 Walter Wolf race car powered by a Chevrolet small block engine  Tanner Foust took on the role of driving Stark s racing car  citation needed  Visual effects and computer interfaces by Perception  including gadgets such as Tony Stark s

four issue miniseries titled Iron Man vs Whiplash as a tie in to the movie  The series introduced a new version of Whiplash that was heavily inspired by the movie s portrayal  as Marvel s existing versions of the character had little resemblance to the movie s depiction  citation needed A three issue miniseries titled Iron Man 2  Public Identity was released in April which serves as a prequel of the events of the movie  Release The international release date of the film was moved forward to increase interest ahead of the 2010 FIFA World Cup soccer tournament  70  Since the film was

is  Certified Fresh   with the critical consensus that  It isn t quite the breath of fresh air that Iron Man was  but this sequel comes close with solid performances and an action packed plot   73 Metacritic gave the film 57  based on a normalized rating of 40 reviews  75  Positive reviewers include Brian Lowry of Variety who stated   Iron Man 2 isn t as much fun as its predecessor  but by the time the smoke clears  it ll do   76  Anthony Lane of The New Yorker said   To find a comic book hero who doesn t agonize over his supergifts  and would defend his constitutional right to get a kick out of them  is frankly a relief   77  David Edelstein of New York Magazine wrote   It doesn t come close to the emotional heft of those two rare 2s that outclassed their ones  Superman II and Spider Man 2  But Iron Man 2 hums along quite nicely   78 Roger Ebert gave it 3 stars out of 4  stating that  Iron Man 2 is a polished  high octane sequel  not as good as the original but building once again on a quirky performance by Robert Downey Jr   79 Frank Lovece of Film Journal International  a one time Marvel Comics writer  said that   In a refreshing and unexpected turn  the sequel to Iron Man doesn t find a changed man  Inside the metal  imperfect humanity grows even more so  as thought provoking questions of identity meet techno fantasy made flesh   80  Critics of the film include Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter  who stated   Everything fun and terrific about Iron Man  a mere two years ago  has vanished with its sequel  In its place  Iron Man 2 has substituted noise  confusion  multiple villains  irrelevant stunts and misguided story lines   81  Box office Iron Man 2 launched internationally with number one openings on Wednesday  April 28  2010  in six European markets for a total  2 2 million from 960 venues  82  It earned  100 2 million its first five days from 6 764 theaters in 53 foreign markets for a strong average of  14 814 per site  4  IMAX

contract with Robert Downey  Jr  to do it  and it will come after The Avengers   Feige said  89  Jon Favreau said that although the character may need reworking  the Mandarin would be in the third film  The director said   The problem with the Mandarin is that the way it s depicted in the comic books  you don t want to see that  He has 10 magical rings   that just doesn t feel right for our  franchise   So it s either tech based  or the rings are not really rings   90  After the release of Iron Man 2  a conflict between Paramount Pictures  which has distribution rights to certain Marvel properties  and The Walt Disney Company  Marvel Entertainment s new corporate parent  clouded the timing and the distribution arrangement of a possible third film  91  On October 18  2010  however  Walt Disney Pictures agreed to pay Paramount at least  115 million for the worldwide distribution rights to Iron Man 3 and The Avengers  92  Disney  Marvel  and Paramount announced a May 3  2013 release date for Iron Man 3  93  Favreau said in December 2010 that he would not direct Iron Man 3  opting to direct Magic Kingdom instead  He remained an executive producer of director Joss Whedon s
