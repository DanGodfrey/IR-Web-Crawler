partiesElections The Republican Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States  along with the Democratic Party  Founded by anti slavery expansion activists in 1854  it is often called the GOP  Grand Old Party   The party s platform generally reflects American conservatism in the U S  political spectrum  1  2  3  American conservatism of the Republican Party is not wholly based upon rejection of the political ideology of liberalism  as many principles of American conservatism are based upon classical liberalism  4  Rather the Republican Party s conservatism is largely based upon its support of classical liberal principles against the modern liberalism of the Democratic Party that is considered American liberalism in contemporary American political discourse  4  In the 112th Congress  elected in 2010  the Republican Party holds a majority of seats in the House of Representatives  and a minority of seats in the Senate  The party holds the majority of governorships  as well as the majority of state legislatures  and control of one chamber in five states  Contents 1 History 1 1 20th century 2 Name and symbols 3 Structure and composition

History Main article  History of the United States Republican Party Abraham Lincoln  the first Republican President  1861 1865  Founded in northern states in 1854 by anti slavery activists  modernizers  ex Whigs and ex Free Soilers  the Republican Party quickly became the principal opposition to the dominant Democratic Party and the briefly popular Know Nothing Party  The main cause was opposition to the Kansas Nebraska Act  which repealed the Missouri Compromise by which slavery was kept out of Kansas  The Republicans saw the expansion of slavery as a great evil  The first public meeting where the name  Republican  was suggested for a new anti slavery party was held on March 20  1854 in a schoolhouse in Ripon  Wisconsin  5  The first official party convention was held on July 6  1854 in Jackson  Michigan  By 1858  the Republicans dominated nearly all northern states  The Republican Party first came to power in 1860 with the election of Lincoln to the Presidency and Republicans in control of Congress and the northern states  It oversaw the saving of the union  the destruction of slavery  and the provision of equal rights to all men in the American Civil War and Reconstruction  1861 1877  6  The Republicans  initial base was in the Northeast and the upper Midwest  With the realignment of parties and voters in the Third Party System  the strong run of John C  Fremont in the 1856 Presidential election demonstrated it dominated most northern states  Early Republican ideology was reflected in the 1856 slogan  free labor  free land  free men   7   Free labor  referred to the Republican opposition to slave labor and belief in independent artisans and businessmen   Free land  referred to Republican opposition to plantation system whereby the rich could buy up all the good farm land and work it with slaves  leaving the yeoman independent farmers the leftovers  The Party had the goal of containing the expansion of slavery  which would cause the collapse of the Slave Power and the expansion of freedom  8  Lincoln  representing the fast growing western states  won the Republican nomination in 1860 and subsequently won the presidency  The party took on the mission of saving the Union and destroying slavery during the American Civil War and over Reconstruction  In the election of 1864  it united with pro war Democrats to nominate Lincoln on the National Union Party ticket  The party s success created factionalism within the party in the 1870s  Those who felt that Reconstruction had been accomplished and was continued mostly to promote the large scale corruption tolerated by President Ulysses S  Grant ran Horace Greeley for the presidency  The Stalwarts defended Grant and the spoils system  the Half Breeds pushed for reform of the civil service  The GOP supported business generally  hard money  i e   the gold standard   high tariffs to promote economic growth  high wages and high profits  generous pensions for Union veterans  and  after 1893  the annexation of Hawaii  The Republicans supported the pietistic Protestants who demanded Prohibition  As the northern post bellum economy boomed with heavy and light industry  railroads  mines  fast growing cities and prosperous agriculture  the Republicans took credit and promoted policies to sustain the fast growth  Nevertheless  by 1890 the Republicans had agreed to the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Interstate Commerce Commission in response to complaints from owners of small businesses and farmers  The high McKinley Tariff of 1890 hurt the party and the Democrats swept to a landslide in the off year elections  even defeating McKinley himself  After the two terms of Democrat Grover Cleveland  the election of William McKinley in 1896 is widely seen as a resurgence of Republican dominance and is sometimes cited as a realigning election  McKinley promised that high tariffs would end the severe hardship caused by the Panic of 1893  and that the GOP would guarantee a sort of pluralism in which all groups would benefit  20th century Theodore Roosevelt  26th President of the United States  1901 1909  Dwight Eisenhower  34th President of the United States  1953 1961  Ronald Reagan  40th President of the United States  1981 1989  The Republicans were cemented as the party of business  though mitigated by the succession of Theodore Roosevelt who embraced trust busting  He later ran on a third party ticket of the Progressive Party and challenged his previous successor William Howard Taft  The party controlled the presidency throughout the 1920s  running on a platform of opposition to the League of Nations  high tariffs  and promotion of business interests  Warren G  Harding  Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover were resoundingly elected in 1920  1924  and 1928 respectively  The Teapot Dome scandal threatened to hurt the party but Harding died and Coolidge blamed everything on him  as the opposition splintered in 1924  The pro business policies of the decade seemed to produce an unprecedented prosperity until the Wall Street Crash of 1929 heralded the Great Depression  The New Deal coalition of Democrat Franklin D  Roosevelt controlled American politics for most of the next three decades  excepting the two term presidency of Republican Dwight D  Eisenhower  African Americans moved into the Democratic Party during Roosevelt s time  After Roosevelt took office in 1933  New Deal legislation sailed through Congress at lightning speed  In the 1934 midterm elections  10 Republican senators went down to defeat  leaving them with only 25 against 71 Democrats  The House of Representatives was split in a similar ratio  Republicans in Congress heavily criticized the  Second New Deal  and likened it to class warfare and socialism  The volume of legislation  and the inability of the Republicans to block it  soon elevated the level of opposition to Roosevelt  Conservative Democrats  mostly from the South  joined with Republicans led by Senator Robert Taft to create the conservative coalition  which dominated domestic issues in Congress until 1964  The Republicans recaptured Congress in 1946 after gaining 13 seats in the Senate and 55 seats in the House  The second half of the 20th century saw election or succession of Republican presidents Dwight D  Eisenhower  Richard Nixon  Gerald Ford  Ronald Reagan  George H  W  Bush and George W  Bush  The Republican Party  led by House Republican Minority Whip Newt Gingrich campaigning on the Contract with America  was elected to majorities to both houses of Congress in the Republican Revolution of 1994  The Senate majority lasted until 2001  when the Senate became split evenly but was regained in the 2002 elections  Both Republican majorities in the House and Senate were held until the Democrats regained control in the mid term elections of 2006  In the 21st century  the Republican Party has been defined by social conservatism  a preemptive war foreign policy intended to defeat terrorism and promote global democracy  a more powerful executive branch  supply side economics  support for gun ownership  and deregulation  In the Presidential election of 2008  the party s nominees were Senator John McCain  of Arizona  for President and Alaska Governor Sarah Palin for Vice President  They were defeated by Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and Senator Joe Biden of Delaware  In 2009  Republicans Chris Christie and Bob McDonnell were elected to the governorships of New Jersey and Virginia  2010 was a year of political success for the GOP  starting with the upset win of Scott Brown in the Massachusetts special Senate election for the seat held for many decades by the Kennedy brothers  In the November elections  the GOP recaptured control of the House  increased their number of seats in the Senate  and gained a majority of governorships  9  In state legislatures  Republicans gained 680 seats  the biggest gain by either party since 1966  As a result of the elections  Republicans held approximately 3 890 of the total state legislative seats in the U S   about 53 percent  That is the most seats in the GOP column since 1928  The Republicans won control of at least 54 of the 99 state legislative chambers  the highest number since 1952  10  Name and symbols 1874 Nast cartoon featuring the first notable appearance of the Republican elephant 11  The red  GOP  logo used by the party for its website The party s founding members chose the name  Republican Party  in the mid 1850s as homage to the values of republicanism promoted by Thomas Jefferson s Republican party  12  The idea for the name came from an editorial by the party s leading publicist Horace Greeley  who called for   some simple name like  Republican   that  would more fitly designate those who had united to restore the Union to its true mission of champion and promulgator of Liberty rather than propagandist of slavery   13  The name reflects the 1776 republican values of civic virtue and opposition to aristocracy and corruption  14  The term  Grand Old Party  is a traditional nickname for the Republican Party  and the abbreviation  G O P    or  GOP   is a commonly used designation  15  The traditional mascot of the party is the elephant  A political cartoon by Thomas Nast  published in Harper s Weekly on November 7  1874  is considered the first important use of the symbol  16  In the early 20th century  the usual symbol of the Republican Party in Midwestern states such as Indiana and Ohio was the eagle  as opposed to the Democratic rooster  This symbol still appears on Indiana  New York  17  dead link  and West Virginia 18  dead link  ballots  After the 2000 election  the color red became associated with the GOP  although the party has not officially adopted it  That election night  for the first time  all of the major broadcast networks used the same color scheme for the electoral map  states won by Republican nominee George W  Bush were colored red  and states won by Democratic nominee Al Gore were colored blue  Although the assignment of colors to political parties is unofficial and informal  they have come to be widely recognized by the media to represent the respective political parties  see Political color and Red states and blue states for more details   Structure and composition Further information  Politics of the United States Organization of American political parties The Republican National Committee  RNC  is responsible for promoting Republican campaign activities  It is responsible for developing and promoting the Republican political platform  as well as coordinating fundraising and election strategy  Its current chairman is Reince Priebus  The chairman of the RNC is chosen by the President when the Republicans have the White House or otherwise by the Party s state committees  The RNC  under the direction of the party s presidential candidate  supervises the Republican National Convention  raises funds  and coordinates campaign strategy  On the local level  there are similar state committees in every state and most large cities  counties and legislative districts  but they have far less money and influence than the national body  The Republican House and Senate caucuses have separate fundraising and strategy committees  The National Republican Congressional Committee  NRCC  assists in House races  and the National Republican Senatorial Committee  NRSC  in Senate races  They each raise over  100 million per election cycle  and play important roles in recruiting strong state candidates  while the Republican Governors Association  RGA  assists in state gubernatorial races  it is currently chaired by Governor Bob McDonnell of Virginia  Ideology and political positions Part

Republican Party  United States  The Republican Party includes fiscal conservatives  social conservatives  neoconservatives  moderates  and libertarians  Prior to the formation of the conservative coalition  which helped realign the Democratic and Republican party ideologies in the mid 1960s  the party historically advocated classical liberalism  paleoconservatism  and progressivism  Economic policies Republicans emphasize the role of free markets and individual achievement as the primary factors behind economic prosperity  To this end  they favor laissez faire economics  fiscal conservatism  and the promotion of personal responsibility over welfare programs  A leading economic theory advocated by modern Republicans is supply side economics  Some fiscal policies influenced by this theory were popularly known as Reaganomics  a term popularized during the Presidential administrations of Ronald Reagan  This theory holds that reduced income tax rates increase GDP growth and thereby generate the same or more revenue for the government from the smaller tax on the extra growth  19  This belief is reflected  in part  by the party s long term advocacy of tax cuts  Many Republicans consider the income tax system to be inherently inefficient and oppose graduated tax rates  which they believe are unfairly targeted at those who create jobs and wealth  They believe private spending is usually more efficient than government spending  Republicans oppose the estate tax  United States This template is part of the series Politics and government of the United States

 to assist the less fortunate  however  they tend to believe the private sector is more effective in helping the poor than government is  as a result  Republicans support giving government grants to faith based and other private charitable organizations to supplant welfare spending  Members of the GOP also believe that limits on eligibility and benefits must be in place to ensure the safety net is not abused  Republicans introduced and strongly supported the welfare reform of 1996  which was signed into law by Democratic President Clinton  and which limited eligibility for welfare  successfully leading to many former welfare recipients finding jobs  20  21  The party opposes a government run single payer health care system  believing such a system constitutes socialized medicine  and is in favor of a personal or employer based system of insurance  supplemented by Medicare for the elderly and Medicaid  which covers approximately 40  of the poor  22  The GOP has a mixed record of supporting the historically popular Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid programs  Congressional Republicans and the Bush administration supported a reduction in Medicaid s growth rate  23  however  congressional Republicans expanded Medicare  supporting a new drug plan for seniors starting in 2006  In 2011  House Republicans overwhelmingly voted for a proposal named The Path to Prosperity and for major changes to Medicare  Medicaid  and the 2010 Health Care Legislation  Many Republicans support increased health insurance portability  laws promoting coverage of pre existing medical conditions  a cap on malpractice lawsuits  the implementation of a streamlined electronic medical records system  an emphasis on preventative care rather than emergency room care  and tax benefits aimed at making health insurance more affordable for the uninsured and targeted to promote universal access  They generally oppose government funding for elective abortions  24  Republicans are generally opposed by labor union management and members  and have supported various legislation on the state and federal levels  including right to work legislation and the Taft Hartley Act  which gives workers the right not to participate in unions  as opposed to a closed shop  which prohibits workers from choosing not to join unions in workplaces  Some Republicans are opposed to increases in the minimum wage  believing that such increases hurt many businesses by forcing them to cut jobs and services  export jobs overseas  and raise the prices of goods to compensate for the decrease in profit  Separation of powers and balance of powers United States Bill of Rights Many contemporary Republicans voice support of strict constructionism  the judicial philosophy that the Constitution should be interpreted narrowly and as close to the original intent as is practicable rather than a more flexible  living Constitution  model  25  Most Republicans point to Roe v  Wade as a case of judicial activism  where the court overturned most laws restricting abortion on the basis of a right to privacy inferred from the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  Some Republicans have actively sought to block judges whom they see as being activist judges and have sought the appointment of judges who claim to practice judicial restraint  Other Republicans  though  argue that it is the right of judges to extend the interpretation of the Constitution and judge actions by the legislative or executive branches as legal or unconstitutional on previously unarticulated grounds  The issue of judicial deference to the legislature is a matter of some debate   like the Democrats  most Republicans criticize court decisions that overturn their own  conservative  legislation as overstepping bounds and support decisions that overturn opposing legislation  Some commentators have advocated that the Republicans take a more aggressive approach and support legislative supremacy more firmly  26  The Republican Party has supported various bills within the last decade to strip some or all federal courts of the ability to hear certain types of cases  in an attempt to limit judicial review  These jurisdiction stripping laws have included removing federal review of the recognition of same sex marriage with the Marriage Protection Act  27  the constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance with the Pledge Protection Act  and the rights of detainees in Guantanamo Bay in the Detainee Treatment Act  The Supreme Court overruled the last of these limitations in Hamdan v  Rumsfeld  Compared with Democrats  many Republicans believe in a more robust version of federalism with greater limitations placed upon federal power and a larger role reserved for the States  Following this view on federalism  Republicans often take a less expansive reading of congressional power under the Commerce Clause  such as in the opinion of William Rehnquist in United States v  Lopez  Many Republicans on the more libertarian wing wish for a more dramatic narrowing of Commerce Clause power by revisiting  among other cases  Wickard v  Filburn  a case that held that growing wheat on a farm for consumption on the same farm fell under congressional power to  regulate commerce     among the several States   President George W  Bush was a proponent of the unitary executive theory and cited it within his Signing statements about legislation passed by Congress  28  The administration s interpretation of the unitary executive theory was called seriously into question by Hamdan v  Rumsfeld  where the Supreme Court ruled 5 3 that the President does not have sweeping powers to override or ignore laws through his power as commander in chief  29  stating  the Executive is bound to comply with the Rule of Law that prevails   30  Following the ruling  the Bush administration has sought Congressional authorization for programs started only on executive mandate  as was the case with the Military Commissions Act  or abandoned programs it had previously asserted executive authority to enact  in the case of the National Security Agency domestic wiretapping program  Environmental policies The Republican Party has long supported the protection of the environment  For example  Republican President Theodore Roosevelt was a prominent conservationist whose policies eventually led to the creation of the modern National Park Service  31  Republican President Richard Nixon was responsible for establishing the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970  32  More recently  California Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger  with the support of 16 other states  sued the Federal Government and the United States Environmental Protection Agency for the right to set vehicle emission standards higher than the Federal Standard  33  a right to which California is entitled under the Clean Air Act  This association however has shifted as the Democratic Party came to also support environmentalism  For example  Democratic President Bill Clinton did not send the Kyoto Protocol to the U S  Senate for ratification  as he thought it unfair to the United States  34  President George W  Bush also publicly opposed ratification of the Kyoto Protocols on the grounds that they unfairly targeted Western industrialized nations such as the United States while favoring developing Global South polluters such as China and India  In 2000  the Republican Party adopted as part of its platform support for the development of market based solutions to environmental problems  According to the platform   economic prosperity and environmental protection must advance together  environmental regulations should be based on science  the government s role should be to provide market based incentives to develop the technologies to meet environmental standards  we should ensure that environmental policy meets the needs of localities  and environmental policy should focus on achieving results processes   35  The Bush administration  36  along with several of the candidates that sought the Republican Presidential nomination in 2008  37  38  39  supported increased Federal investment into the development of clean alternative fuels  increased nuclear power  and well as fuels such as ethanol  as a way of helping the U S  achieve energy independence  as opposed to supporting less use of carbon dioxide producing methods of generating energy  McCain supports the cap and trade policy  a policy that is quite popular among Democrats but much less so among other Republicans  Some Republicans support increased oil drilling in currently protected areas such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  a position that has drawn sharp criticism from some activists  Social policies Social services Some Republicans favor faith based initiatives  There are some exceptions  especially in the Northeast and Pacific Coast states  Race They are generally against affirmative action for women and some minorities  often describing it as a quota system  believing that it is not meritocratic and that is counter productive socially by only further promoting discrimination  Many Republicans support race neutral admissions policies in universities but support taking into account the socioeconomic status of the student  40  41  Capital punishment Most of the GOP s membership favors capital punishment and stricter punishments as a means to prevent crime  Gun rights Republicans generally support gun ownership rights and oppose laws regulating guns  although some Republicans in urban areas sometimes favor limited restrictions on the grounds that they are necessary to protect safety in large cities  Education Most Republicans support school choice through charter schools and school vouchers for private schools  many have denounced the performance of the public school system and the teachers  unions  The party has insisted on a system of greater accountability for public schools  most prominently in recent years with the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001  Many Republicans  however  opposed the creation of the United States Department of Education when it was initially created in 1979  Some in the religious wing of the party support voluntary organized prayer in public schools and the teaching of intelligent design in science classes  Abortion and related issues A majority of the GOP s national and state candidates are pro life and oppose elective abortion on religious or moral grounds  Although the GOP has voted for increases in government funding of scientific research  some members actively oppose the federal funding of embryonic stem cell research beyond the original lines because it involves the destruction of human embryos  which many consider ethically equivalent to abortion   while arguing for applying research money into adult stem cell or amniotic stem cell research  The stem cell issue has garnered two once rare vetoes on research funding bills from President Bush  who said the research  crossed a moral boundary   LGBT issues The 2004 Republican platform expressed support for the Federal Marriage Amendment to the United States Constitution to define marriage as exclusively between one man and one woman  Generally speaking  most Republicans have opposed government recognition of same sex unions such as with same sex marriage  This opposition formed a key method of energizing conservative voters  the Republican base  in the 2004 election  A New York Times and CBS News collaborative poll released in April 2009 reported that 18  of Republicans favored recognition of same sex marriage  42  An August 2010 Fox poll found 19  support  43  Historically  most Republicans have opposed permitting LGBT people to serve openly in the military and supported the  don t ask  don t tell  policy  However  majorities of 52  and 58  among Republicans in both 2004 and 2009 opposed the policy and supported open enlistment  according to Gallup polling  44  Groups pushing for LGBT issues inside the party include Log Cabin Republicans and GOProud  Fox News national exit polls of self described LGBT voters found that 24  voted Republican in 2004 and in 2006  That value was 19  and 31  in 2008 and 2010  respectively  45  In 2011  28  of Republicans supported gay marriage  46  National defense and military spending Although the Republican Party has always advocated a strong national defense  historically they disapproved of interventionist foreign policy actions  Republicans opposed Woodrow Wilson s intervention in World War I and his subsequent attempt to create the League of Nations  They were also staunchly opposed to intervention in World War II until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor  Dwight Eisenhower In 1952 Dwight D  Eisenhower was drafted by the Republican party to counter the candidacy of non interventionist Senator Robert Taft  Eisenhower s campaign was a crusade against the Truman administration s policies regarding  Korea  Communism and Corruption   47  Ronald Reagan Grenada On October 25  1983  at the request of the regional governments  Reagan ordered Operation Urgent Fury  a military invasion of the small  Caribbean island of Grenada  where over a thousand American students and their families were in residence  A Marxist coup d  tat had overthrown the established government and shot its leader Maurice Bishop  This was the first actual rollback that destroyed a Communist regime and marked the continued escalation of tensions with the Soviet Union known as the Second Cold War  Democrats had been highly critical of Reagan s anti Communism in Latin America  but this time Reagan had strong support from the voters and leading Democrats said the invasion was justified  48  It built the President s image of decisive strong action a year before the 1984 election  when Mondale said he too would have ordered the invasion  Indeed Mondale attacked Senator Gary Hart  his chief opponent for the Democratic nomination  as isolationist and weak on fighting dictatorships  49  Cold War Reagan escalated the Cold War  accelerating a reversal from the policy of d tente  which began in 1979 under President Jimmy Carter following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan  50  Reagan then ordered a massive buildup of the United States Armed Forces 51  Covert operations Under a policy that came to be known as the Reagan Doctrine  Reagan and his administration also provided overt and covert aid to anti communist resistance movements in an effort to  rollback  Soviet backed communist governments in Africa  Asia and Latin America  The policy was politically controversial  with liberal Democrats especially angry with Reagan s operations in Latin America  49  Covert operations elsewhere  especially in Afghanistan against the Soviets  however  usually won bipartisan support  52  George H  W  Bush Gulf War 1990 91 Main article  Gulf War On August 1  1990  Iraq  led by Saddam Hussein  invaded Kuwait  President Bush formed an international coalition and secured UN approval to expel Iraq  On January 12  1991  Congress voted approval for a military attack  Operation Desert Storm  by a narrow margin  with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed  The vote in the House was 250 183  and in the Senate 52 47  In the Senate 42 Republicans and 10 Democrats voted yes to war  while 45 Democrats and two Republicans voted no  In the House 164 Republicans and 86 Democrats voted yes  and 179 Democrats  three Republicans and one Independent voted no  53  The war was short and successful  but Hussein was allowed to remain in power  Arab countries repaid all the American military costs  54  In the 1990s  Republicans opposed the intervention of the United States in the Balkans under President Bill Clinton 55  and in 2000  George W  Bush ran on a platform that opposed these types of involvement in foreign conflicts  George W  Bush Invasion of Afghanistan After the September 11 attacks in 2001 in New York  Bush launched the War on Terrorism  in which the United States led an international coalition invaded Afghanistan  the base of terrorist Osama bin Laden  This invasion led to the toppling of the Taliban regime  After a surprise raid on bin Laden s compound on May 2  2011  ordered by Barack Obama  bin Laden was killed and his body disposed of in the sea  There was bipartisan support for this action  with notable Republican and Democratic figures speaking out in support of the raid  Invasion of Iraq In 2003  George W  Bush launched the invasion of Iraq  in conjunction with coalition partners  most notably Great Britain  The invasion was described by Bush as being part of the War on Terrorism  Saddam Hussein was captured and executed  but his supporters staged an insurgency that dragged on for years  It was a major election issue in 2004  when Bush was reelected  and in 2006 and 2008  when the Democrats won   56  Policies As a result  some in the Republican Party support unilateralism on issues of national security  believing in the ability and right of the United States to act without external support in matters of its national defense  In general  Republican thinking on defense and international relations is heavily influenced by the theories of neorealism and realism  characterizing conflicts between nations as struggles between faceless forces of international structure  as opposed to being the result of the ideas and actions of individual leaders  The realist school s influence shows in Reagan s Evil Empire stance on the Soviet Union and George W  Bush s Axis of evil  Republicans secured gains in the 2002 and 2004 elections  with the War on Terror being one of the top issues favoring them  Since the September 11  2001 attacks  some in the party support neoconservative policies with regard to the War on Terror  including the 2001 war in Afghanistan and the 2003 invasion of Iraq  The doctrine of preemptive war  wars to disarm and destroy potential military foes based on speculation of future attacks rather than in defense against actual attack  has been advocated by prominent members of the Bush administration  but the war within Iraq has undercut the influence of this doctrine within the Republican Party  Rudy Giuliani  mayor of New York at the time of the September 11 terrorist attacks  and a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008  has stated his support for that policy  saying America must keep itself  on the offensive  against terrorists  The George W  Bush administration took the position that the Geneva Conventions do not apply to unlawful combatants  saying they apply to soldiers serving in the armies of nation states and not terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda  The Supreme Court overruled this position in Hamdan v  Rumsfeld  which held that the Geneva Conventions were legally binding and must be followed in regards to all enemy combatants  Prominent Republicans such as John McCain  Mike Huckabee  and Ron Paul strongly oppose the use of enhanced interrogation techniques  which they view as torture  Other international policies Israel The Republican leadership supports a strong Israel  but supports efforts to secure peace in the Middle East between Israel and its Arab neighbors  57  Russia The Republican party claims U S  should promote friendship not only between the United States and Russia  but also between Russia and its neighbors  With Russia  the U S  needs patience  consistency  and a principled reliance on democratic forces  Russia must stop encouraging the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  58  The party stress the common interests of the two countries which includes ending terrorism  combating nuclear proliferation  promoting bilateral trade  59  Trade The party  through former U N  Ambassador John Bolton  has advocated reforms in the United Nations to halt corruption such as that which afflicted the Oil for Food Program  Most Republicans oppose the Kyoto Protocol  The party promotes free trade agreements  most notably North American Free Trade Agreement  Dominican Republic   Central America Free Trade Agreement and now an effort to go further south to Brazil  Peru and Colombia  although some have a protectionist view of trade  Immigration Republicans are divided on how to confront illegal immigration between a platform that allows for migrant workers and easing citizenship guidelines  and border enforcement first approach  In general  pro growth advocates within the Republican Party support more immigration  and traditional or populist conservatives oppose it  In 2006  the White House supported and Republican led Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform that would eventually allow millions of illegal immigrants to become citizens  but the House  also led by Republicans  took an enforcement first approach  and the bill failed to pass the conference committee  60  Political status of Puerto Rico The Republican Party has expressed its support for the U S  citizens of Puerto Rico to exercise their right to determine a future permanent non territorial political status with government by consent  full enfranchisement and to be admitted to the union as a fully sovereign U S  state  Puerto Rico has been under U S  sovereignty for over a century and Puerto Ricans have been U S  citizens since 1917  but the island s ultimate status still has not been determined and its 3 9 million residents still do not have voting representation in their national government  The following is a section from the 2008 party platform  unchanged from the 2004 and 2000 platforms   61  62  63  We support the right of the United States citizens of Puerto Rico to be admitted to the Union as a fully sovereign state after they freely so determine  We recognize that Congress has the final authority to define the constitutionally valid options for Puerto Rico to achieve a permanent non territorial status with government by consent and full enfranchisement  As long as Puerto Rico is not a state  however  the will of its people regarding their political status should be ascertained by means of a general right of referendum or specific referenda sponsored by the U S  government  Voter base As of 2010 update   Gallup polling found that 31  of Americans identified as Democrats  29  as Republicans  and 38  as independents  64  Business community The GOP is usually seen as the traditionally pro business party and it garners major support from a wide variety of industries from the financial sector to small businesses  Republicans are about 50 percent more likely to be self employed  and are more likely to work in management  65  Gender Since 1980  a  gender gap  has seen slightly stronger support for the GOP among men than among women  In the 2006 House races  43  of women voted for GOP  while 47  of men did so  66  In the 2010 midterms  the  gender gap  was reduced with women supporting GOP and Democratic candidates equally 49  to 49   67  68  Race Currently  most of the Republican voter base is Caucasian  While historically the party had been supporters of rights for African Americans since the 1860s  it lost its leadership position  the GOP has been winning under 15  of the black vote in recent national elections  1980 to 2008   The party has recently nominated African American candidates for senator or governor in Illinois  Ohio  Pennsylvania and Maryland  though none were successful  In the 2010 elections  two African American Republicans were elected to the U S  House of Representatives  69  The Republican Party abolished slavery under Abraham Lincoln  defeated the Slave Power  and gave blacks the vote during Reconstruction in the late 1860s  Until the New Deal of the 1930s  blacks supported the GOP by large margins  70  Most black voters switched to the Democratic Party in the 1930s when the New Deal offered them employment opportunities  and major figures  such as Eleanor Roosevelt  began to support civil rights  They became one of the core components of the New Deal Coalition  In the South  blacks were able to vote in large numbers after 1965  when a bipartisan coalition passed the Voting Rights Act  and ever since have formed a significant portion  20 50   of the Democratic vote in that region  71  In recent decades  the party has been moderately successful in gaining support from Hispanic and Asian American voters  George W  Bush  who campaigned energetically for Hispanic votes  received 35  of their vote in 2000 and 44  in 2004  72  The party s strong anti communist stance has made it popular among some minority groups from current and former Communist states  in particular Cuban Americans  Korean Americans  Chinese Americans  and Vietnamese Americans  The election of Bobby Jindal as Governor of Louisiana has been hailed as pathbreaking  73  He is the first elected minority governor in Louisiana and the first state governor of Indian descent  74  In the 2008 presidential election  John McCain won 55  of white votes  35  of Asian votes  31  of Hispanic votes  and 4  of African American votes  75  In the 2010 House election  the GOP won 60  of the white votes  38  of Hispanic votes  and 9  of the African American vote  76  For decades  a greater percentage of white voters identified themselves as Democrats  rather than Republicans  However  since the mid 1990s whites have been more likely to self identify as Republicans than Democrats  77  Family status In recent elections  Republicans have found their greatest support among whites from married couples with children living at home  78  Unmarried and divorced women were far more likely to vote for Kerry in 2004  79  Income Low income voters tend to favor the Democratic Party while high income voters tend to support the Republican Party  President George W  Bush won 41  of the poorest 20  of voters in 2004  55  of the richest twenty percent  and 53  of those in between  In the 2006 House races  the voters with incomes over  50 000 were 49  Republican  while those under were 38   66  Military Republicans hold a large majority in the armed services  with 57  of active military personnel and 66  of officers identified as Republican in 2003  80  Education Self identified Republicans are significantly more likely than Democrats to have 4 year college degrees  The trends for the years 1955 through 2004 are shown by gender in the graphs below  reproduced from a book published by Joseph Fried  81  These graphs depict results obtained by Fried from the National Election Studies  NES  database  Regarding graduate level degrees  masters or doctorate   there is a rough parity between Democrats and Republicans  According to the Gallup Organization    B oth Democrats and Republicans have equal numbers of Americans at the upper end of the educational spectrum   that is  with post graduate degrees     81  Fried provides a slightly more detailed analysis  noting that Republican men are more likely than Democratic men to have advanced degrees  but Democratic women are now more likely than Republican women to have advanced degrees  82  Republicans remain a small minority of college professors  with 11  of full time faculty identifying as Republican  83  Age The Democrats do better among younger Americans and Republicans among older Americans  In 2006  the GOP won 38  of the voters aged 18 29  66  Sexual Orientation Exit polls conducted in 2000  2004 and 2006 indicate that about one quarter of gay and lesbian Americans voted for the GOP  In recent years  many in the party have opposed same sex marriage  adoption by same sex couples  inclusion of sexual orientation in federal hate crimes laws  the Employment Non Discrimination Act  while supporting the use of the don t ask  don t tell policy within the military  Some members of the party  particularly in the Northeast and Pacific coast  support civil unions and adoption rights for same sex couples  84  The opposition to gay rights largely comes from the socially conservative wing of the party  85  Religion Religion has always played a major role for both parties but  in the course of a century  the parties  religious compositions have changed  Religion was a major dividing line between the parties before 1960  with Catholics  Jews  and Southern Protestants heavily Democratic  and Northeastern Protestants heavily Republican  Most of the old differences faded away after the realignment of the 1970s and 80s that undercut the New Deal coalition  Voters who attend church weekly gave 61  of their votes to Bush in 2004  those who attend occasionally gave him only 47   while those who never attend gave him 36   Fifty nine percent of Protestants voted for Bush  along with 52  of Catholics  even though John Kerry was Catholic   Since 1980  large majorities of evangelicals have voted Republican  70 80  voted for Bush in 2000 and 2004  and 70  for GOP House candidates in 2006  Jews continue to vote 70 80  Democratic  Democrats have close links with the African American churches  especially the National Baptists  while their historic dominance among Catholic voters has eroded to 54 46 in the 2010 midterms  75  The main line traditional Protestants  Methodists  Lutherans  Presbyterians  Episcopalians  have dropped to about 55  Republican  in contrast to 75  before 1968   Their church memberships have declined in that time as well as the conservative evangelical churches have grown  Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  commonly known as Mormons  are overwhelmingly Republican and vote in line with the Christian right   George W  Bush received 89  of the Mormon vote  86  Bush also received almost 80  of the Muslim vote in the 2000 Presidential election  However  his support among Muslims declined sharply and  by the 2004 election  at least half of those voters supported Democratic candidate John Kerry or a third party candidate  87  This map shows the vote in the 2004 presidential election by county  All major Republican geographic constituencies are visible  red dominates the map  showing Republican strength in the rural areas  while the denser areas  i e   cities  are blue  Notable exceptions include the Pacific coast  New England  the Black Belt  areas with high Native American populations  and the heavily Hispanic parts of the Southwest  Location Since 1980  geographically the Republican  base    red states   is strongest in the South  the Midwest  and Mountain West  While it is currently weakest on the West Coast and Northeast  this has not always been the case  historically the northeast was a bastion of the Republican Party with Vermont and Maine being the only two states to vote against Franklin Roosevelt all four times  The Midwest has been roughly balanced since 1854  with Illinois becoming more Democratic and liberal because of the city of Chicago  see below  and Minnesota and Wisconsin more Republican since 1990  Ohio and Indiana both trend Republican  Since the 1930s  the Democrats have dominated most central cities  while the Republicans now dominate rural areas and the majority of suburbs  88  The South has become solidly Republican in national elections since 1980  and has been trending Republican at the state level since then at a slower pace  89  In 2004  Bush led Kerry by 70  30  among Southern whites  who made up 71  of the Southern electorate  Kerry had a 70 30 lead among the 29  of the voters who were black or Hispanic  One third of these Southern voters said they were white evangelicals  they voted for Bush by 80 20  but were only 72  Republican in 2006  66  72  The Republican Party s strongest focus of political influence lies in the Great Plains states  particularly Oklahoma  Kansas  Nebraska  South Dakota  and North Dakota  and in the Mountain states of Idaho  Wyoming  and Utah  Utah gave George W  Bush more than 70  of the popular vote in 2004   These states are sparsely populated with few major urban centers  and have majority white populations  making it extremely difficult for Democrats to create a sustainable voter base there  Unlike the South  these areas have been strongly Republican since before the party realignments of the 1960s  The Great Plains states were one of the few areas of the country where Republicans had any significant support during the Great Depression  Conservatives and Moderates Republican  conservatives  are strongest in the South  Mountain West and Midwest  where they draw support from social conservatives  The moderates tend to dominate the party in New England  and used to be well represented in all states  From the 1940s to the 1970s under such leaders as Thomas E  Dewey  Dwight D  Eisenhower  Nelson Rockefeller  and Richard Nixon  they usually dominated the presidential wing of the party  Since the 1970s  they have been less powerful  though they are always represented in the cabinets of Republican presidents  In Vermont  Jim Jeffords  a Republican Senator became an independent in 2001 due to growing disagreement with President Bush and the party leadership  In addition  moderate Republicans have recently held the governorships in several New England States  while Lincoln Chafee  a former moderate Republican senator is currently the independent governor of Rhode Island  Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins  both of Maine  and Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts are notable moderate Republicans from New England  From 1991 to 2007  moderate Republicans served as Governor of Massachusetts  Some well known conservative radio hosts  including national figures such as Rush Limbaugh  Sean Hannity  Glenn Beck  Neal Boortz  Laura Ingraham  Michael Reagan  Howie Carr  and Michael Savage  as well as many local commentators  support Republican causes  while vocally opposing those of the Democrats  90  Trends As of 2004 update   the Republican Party had remained fairly cohesive  as both strong economic libertarians and social conservatives opposed the Democrats  whom they saw as the party of bloated and more secular  liberal government  91  Yet  some libertarians have argued that the GOP s policies have grown increasingly restrictive of personal liberties  and has contributed to increasing corporate welfare and national debt  92  Some social conservatives have expressed dissatisfaction with the party s support for economic policies that they see as sometimes in conflict with their moral values  93  2012 election Main article  Republican Party presidential primaries  2012 As the presidential campaign season headed toward the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary in January 2012  one candidate after another surged  then fell back  94  with Mitt Romney holding steady in the mid 20s as the favorite of the moderates  In the USA Today Gallup Poll  six hopefuls at one time or another were the top choice of GOP voters in 2011  former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee  real estate tycoon Donald Trump  former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney  Texas governor Rick Perry  businessman Herman Cain and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich  95  The surprise of the Iowa caucuses on January 3  2012  was the sudden rise of Rick Santorum  who narrowly defeated Mitt Romney with 25  each  with Ron Paul finishing third at 21   The first primary in New Hampshire on January was won by Romney  taking 39   over Paul  23   and Jon Huntsman  17    96  State and territorial parties Alabama Republican Party  2  Republican Party of Alaska  3  Arizona Republican Party  4  Republican Party of
