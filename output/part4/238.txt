came a day  a day unlike any other  when Earth s mightiest heroes and heroines found themselves united against a common threat  On that day  the Avengers were born to fight the foes no single super hero could withstand  Through the years  their roster has prospered  changing many times  but their glory has never been denied  Heed the call  then for now  the Avengers Assemble    Prologue from The Avengers volume  amp  issue needed  The first adventure features the Asgardian trickster god Loki  who seeks revenge against his brother Thor  Using an illusion  Loki tricks the Hulk into destroying a railroad track  He then diverts a radio call by Rick Jones for help to Thor  whom Loki hopes will battle the Hulk  Unknown to Loki  the radio call is also answered by Ant Man  the Wasp  and Iron Man  After an initial misunderstanding  the heroes unite and defeat Loki after Thor is lured away by an illusion of the Hulk and suspects Loki when he realises it is an illusion  Ant Man states the five work well together and suggests they form a combined team  the Wasp names the group  the Avengers  because it sounded  dramatic   11  The roster changes almost immediately  by the beginning of the second issue  Ant Man has become Giant Man and  at the end of the issue  the Hulk leaves once he realizes how much the others fear his unstable personality  12  Feeling responsible  the Avengers try to locate and contain the Hulk  which subsequently leads them into combat with Namor the Sub Mariner  13  This would result in the first major milestone in the Avengers  history  the revival and return of Captain America  14  Captain America joins the team  14  and he is also given  founding member  status in the Hulk s place  15  The Avengers go on to fight foes such as Captain America s wartime enemy Baron Zemo  who forms the Masters of Evil  16 Kang the Conqueror  13 Wonder Man  17  and Count Nefaria  18  The next milestone came when every member but Captain America resigned and were replaced by three former villains  Hawkeye  the Scarlet Witch  and Quicksilver  19  Although lacking the raw power of the original team   Cap s Kooky Quartet  20   as they were sometimes jokingly called   proved their worth by fighting and defeating the Swordsman  21  the original Power Man  22  and Doctor Doom  23  They are soon rejoined by Henry Pym  who changes his name to Goliath  24  and the Wasp  24  along with Hercules  25  the Black Knight  26  and the Black Widow  27  although the last two do not obtain official membership status until years later  When writer Roy Thomas commenced  there was a greater focus on characterization  citation needed  The Black Panther joins the team  28  followed by the Vision  29  Thomas also established that the Avengers are headquartered in a New York City building called Avengers Mansion  provided courtesy of Tony Stark  Iron Man s real identity   who also funds the Avengers through the Maria Stark Foundation  a non profit organization  volume  amp  issue needed  The mansion is serviced by Edwin Jarvis  the Avengers  faithful butler  and also furnished with state of the art technology and defense systems  including the Avengers

issue needed  The Vision and the Scarlet Witch fall in love  although the relationship is tinged with sadness as the Vision believes himself to be inhuman and unworthy of her  volume  amp  issue needed  Writer Steve Englehart then introduces Mantis  who joins the team along with the reformed Swordsman  32  Englehart linked her origins to the very beginnings of the Kree Skrull conflict in a time spanning adventure involving Kang the Conqueror and the mysterious Immortus  who are revealed to be past and future versions of each other  volume  amp  issue needed  Mantis is revealed to be the Celestial Madonna  who is destined to give birth to a being that will save the universe  volume  amp  issue needed  This saga also reveals that the Vision s body had only been appropriated  and not created  by Ultron  and that it had originally belonged to the 1940s Human Torch  With his origins now clear to him  the Vision proposes to the Scarlet Witch  The Celestial Madonna saga ends with their wedding  presided over by Immortus  33  Englehart s tenure also coincided with the debut of George P rez as artist  34  After Englehart s departure  and a seven issue stint by Gerry Conway  Jim Shooter began as writer  generating several classic adventures  including  Bride of Ultron   the  Nefaria Trilogy   and  The Korvac Saga   featuring nearly every Avenger who joined the team up to that point  35  New members added during this time include the Beast  36  a resurrected Wonder Man  Captain America s former partner the Falcon  and Ms  Marvel  volume  amp  issue needed  Shooter also introduced the character of Henry Peter Gyrich  the Avengers  liaison to the United States National Security Council  37  Gyrich is prejudiced against superhumans and acts in a heavy handed  obstructive manner  insisting that the Avengers follow government rules and regulations or else lose their priority status with the government  Among Gyrich s demands is that the active roster be trimmed down to only seven members  and that the Falcon  an African American  be admitted to the team to comply with affirmative action laws  This last act is resented by Hawkeye  who because of the seven member limit loses his membership slot to the Falcon  The Falcon  in turn  is unhappy to be the beneficiary of what he perceives to be tokenism  and decides to resign from the team  after which Wonder Man rejoins  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  1980s The Avengers  200  Oct  1980   Cover art by George P rez and Terry Austin  The first major development was the breakdown of Henry Pym  volume  amp  issue needed  with his frequent changes of costume and name being symptomatic of an identity problem and an inferiority complex  After abusing his wife  failing to win back the confidence of the Avengers with a ruse and being duped by the villain Egghead  Pym is jailed  38  Writer Roger Stern later resolves this by having Pym outwit Egghead and defeat the latest incarnation of the Masters of Evil singlehandedly  thereby proving his innocence  39  Pym reconciles with the Wasp  but they decide to remain apart  40  Pym also retires from superheroics  40  but returns some years later  41  Stern developed several major storylines  such as  Ultimate Vision  in which the Vision takes over the world s computer systems in a misguided attempt to create world peace  42  the formation of the West Coast Avengers  43  and  Avengers Under Siege  which involves the second Baron Zemo and the Masters of Evil taking over the mansion and severely injuring Jarvis and Hercules  44   War on Olympus  in which Hercules  father Zeus blames the Avengers for his son s injuries and brings them to Olympus for trial 45  and  Heavy Metal  in which the Super Adaptoid organizes several

claimed  falsely  to be the granddaughter of Thanos  53  The team also relocated for a period to a floating island off the coast of New York called Hydrobase  The Avengers moved their base of operations to Hydrobase after the  Under Siege  storyline was completed in The Avengers  277  March 1987  where Avengers Mansion was severely damaged  The move to Hydrobase was undertaken in The

the comics to allow members to be active when available and reserve when not available and merged the volume  amp  issue needed  two separate Avengers teams into one team with two bases  Byrne s contributions included a revamping of the Vision  and the discovery that the children of the Scarlet Witch and the Vision are actually illusions  The loss of the Scarlet Witch s children and the Vision  who is disassembled by government agents in retaliation for the  Ultimate Vision  storyline  drives her insane  although she eventually recovers and rejoins the team  This story also revealed that the Scarlet Witch s powers include wide range reality manipulation and she is what the time traveling Immortus refers to as a  nexus being  setting the stage for 2004 s eventual  Chaos  and  Avengers Disassembled  storylines  This played out in the  Darker than Scarlet  storyline which ran in Avengers West Coast from issues  51 62  Nov  1989   Sept  1990   The Avengers titles were then embroiled in the major crossover event  Acts of Vengeance  wherein Loki assembles many of Marvel s arch villains  with his inner circle consisting of Doctor Doom  Magneto  Kingpin  Mandarin  Wizard  and Red Skull  in a plot to destroy the team  Loki orchestrates a mass breakout of villains from prison facility the Vault  as part of his Acts of Vengeance scheme  but he ultimately fails in his goal to destroy the Avengers  This decade coincided with a speculators  boom  followed by an industry wide slump and Marvel filing for bankruptcy in 1997  During this period the U S  government revokes the Avengers  New York State charter in a treaty with the Soviet Union  The Avengers then received a charter from the United Nations and again the Avengers split into two teams with a substitute reserve team backing up the main teams  Bob Harras and Steve Epting took over the title  volume  amp  issue needed  and introduced a stable lineup with ongoing storylines and character development focused on the Black Knight  Sersi  Crystal  Quicksilver  Hercules and the Vision  Their primary enemies in this run include the mysterious Proctor and the Shi ar warrior Deathcry  During this period  the team finds themselves facing increasingly murderous enemies  and are forced to question their rule against killing  volume  amp  issue needed  This culminated in  Operation  Galactic Storm   a 19 part storyline that ran through all Avengers related titles and showcases a conflict between the Kree and the Shi ar Empire  The team splits when Iron Man and several dissidents execute the Supreme Intelligence against the wishes of Captain America  After a vote disbanding the West Coast Avengers  Iron Man forms a proactive and aggressive team called Force Works  During the team s first mission Wonder Man is apparently killed again  his atoms are actually only temporarily scattered   Force Works later disbands after it is revealed that Iron Man has become a murderer via the manipulations of the villain Kang  54   edit   Heroes Reborn  The Avengers vol  2   11  Sept  1997   showing the Heroes Reborn Avengers  Cover art by Michael Ryan and Sal Regla  Together with the Fantastic Four and others  many of the Avengers apparently died stopping the gestalt psychic entity Onslaught  although it is later revealed that Franklin Richards preserved these heroes in a pocket universe  Believing the main team gone  the Black Widow disbands the Avengers  with only butler Jarvis remaining to tend to the Mansion  Marvel contracted out The Avengers and three related titles Captain America
