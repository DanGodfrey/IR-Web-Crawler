versions of Blob  Mastermind  Quicksilver  Scarlet Witch  and Toad  It is soon revealed that the mutated versions of Blob  Mastermind  Quicksilver  Scarlet Witch  and Toad are clones created by Joseph  80   edit  Powers and abilities The Scarlet Witch is a mutant who had the ability to manipulate probability via her  hexes   often manifesting physically as  hex spheres  or  hex bolts    These hexes are relatively short range  and are limited to her line of sight  Casting a hex requires a gesture and concentration on her part  though the gestures are largely a focus for the concentration and despite this precision  the hexes are not necessarily guaranteed to work  particularly if Wanda is tired or using her powers excessively  If overextended  Wanda s hexes can backfire  causing probability to work against her wishes or to undo previous hexes  Early in her career  her hexes were unconscious on her part  and would be automatically triggered whenever she made a particular gesture  regardless of her intent  These hexes would only manifest  bad luck  effects  She later gained enough control over her powers that her powers only work when she wants them to  and they are not limited to negative effects  She can use her hexes to light flammable objects  contain or remove air from a particular volume  deflect objects  stop the momentum of projectiles  open doors  explode objects  create force fields and deflect magical attacks etc  The effects are varied but almost always detrimental to opponents  such as causing the artifact the Evil Eye to work against inter dimensional warlord Dormammu  81  the robot Ultron to short circuit  27  or a gas main underneath the Brotherhood of Mutants to explode  82  Wanda is an expert combatant having been trained by both Captain America and Hawkeye  as well as being an adept tactician due to her years of experience working as an Avenger and her experience in a variety of combat situations  The Scarlet Witch also has the potential to wield magic and later learned that she was destined to serve the role of Nexus Being  a living focal point for the Earth dimension s mystical energy  volume  amp  issue needed  Writer Kurt Busiek redefined the Scarlet Witch s powers  and maintained that it was in fact an ability to manipulate chaos magic  activated when she was born  Busiek s redefinition upgraded Wanda s powers substantially  and she is shown as being capable of feats such as the resurrection of Wonder Man  She was here described as the  nexus being  of the Marvel Universe  capable of birthing children with power enough to challenge avatars of Eternity  83  Writer Brian Michael Bendis revamped Wanda s powers yet again  with Doctor Strange stating that there was in fact no such thing as chaos magic  and that Wanda had been altering reality all along  Her power was here depicted as sufficient to rewrite her entire universe  84  and cause multiverse threatening ripples  85  When the Elder god and primeval demon Chthon was summoned to Earth Dimension by the power of the Darkhold and took Quicksilver as his host  he revealed that there is in fact Chaos Magic  a form of magic so dreaded and horrific that all of Earth s sorcerers made a pact to end Chthon s reign with a lie  that there is no God of Chaos and no Chaos Magic which is the basis for Chthon s unholy might  Later on after Chthon was exorcised from Quicksilver  he mentioned that he found in the Darkhold a leading text on Chaos Magic  the power which he believes is the source for his sister s insanity  86  Wanda s power to alter reality was spawned from the combination of her natural mutant abilities to affect probability and Chaos Magic  Because of the nature of her powers  she does not possess certain limitations such as other reality warpers such as Mad Jim Jaspers who needs existing reality to use his powers  Her powers which stemmed out from the ability to manipulate probabilities suggest that she does not need existing matter to warp reality  only possibilities which are endless  It must also be noted that the Scarlet Witch is responsible for the resurrection of Mad Jim Jaspers which happened when her powers altered reality  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Other versions The Ultimate Scarlet Witch on the cover of Ultimate Power  6  Sep  2007   Art by Greg Land   edit  Age of Apocalypse During the
