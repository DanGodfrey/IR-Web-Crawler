logo  used until the 1967 sale to Transamerica UA was incorporated as a joint venture on February 5  1919  by four of the leading figures in early Hollywood  Mary Pickford  Charles Chaplin  Douglas Fairbanks  and D  W  Griffith  Each held a 20  stake  with the remaining 20  held by lawyer William Gibbs McAdoo  4  The idea for the venture originated with Fairbanks  Chaplin  Pickford  and cowboy star William S  Hart a year earlier as they were traveling around the U S  selling Liberty bonds to help the World War I effort  Already veterans of Hollywood  the four film stars began to talk of forming their own company to better control their own work as well as their futures  They were spurred on by established Hollywood producers and distributors who were tightening their control over actor salaries and creative decisions  a process that evolved into the rigid studio system  With the addition of Griffith  planning began  but Hart bowed out before things had formalized  When he heard about their scheme  Richard A  Rowland  head of Metro Pictures  is said to have observed   The inmates are taking over the asylum   The four partners  with advice from McAdoo  son in law and former Treasury Secretary of then President Woodrow Wilson   formed their distribution company  with Hiram Abrams as its first managing director  List of UA stockholders in 1920 The original terms called for Pickford  Fairbanks  Griffith and Chaplin to independently produce five pictures each year  But by the time the company got under way in 1920 1921  feature films were becoming more expensive and more polished  and running times had settled at around ninety minutes  or eight reels   It was believed that no one  no matter how popular  could produce and star in five quality feature films a year  By 1924  by which time Griffith had dropped out  the company was facing a crisis  either bring in others to help support a costly distribution system or concede defeat  The veteran producer Joseph Schenck was hired as president  Not only had he been producing pictures for a decade  but he brought along commitments for films starring his wife  Norma Talmadge  his sister in law  Constance Talmadge  and his brother in law  Buster Keaton  Contracts were signed with a number of independent producers  most notably Samuel Goldwyn  Alexander Korda and Howard Hughes  Schenck also formed a separate partnership with Pickford and Chaplin to buy and build theaters under the United Artists name  They also began international operations  first in Canada  then in Mexico  and by the end of the 1930s  United Artists was represented in over 40 countries  D W  Griffith  Mary Pickford  Charlie Chaplin  seated  and Douglas Fairbanks at the signing of the contract establishing United Artists motion picture studio in 1919  Lawyers Albert Banzhaf  left  and Dennis F  O Brien  right  stand in the background  Still  even with a broadening of the company  UA struggled  The coming of sound ended the careers of Pickford and Fairbanks  Chaplin  rich enough to do what he pleased  worked only occasionally  Schenck resigned in 1933 to organize a new company with Darryl F  Zanuck  Twentieth Century Pictures  which soon provided four pictures a year to UA s schedule  He was replaced as president by sales manager Al Lichtman who himself resigned after only a few months  Pickford produced a few films  and at various times Goldwyn  Korda  Walt Disney  Walter Wanger  and David O  Selznick were made  producing partners   i e   sharing in the profits   but ownership still rested with the founders  As the years passed and the dynamics of the business changed  these  producing partners  drifted away  Goldwyn and Disney to RKO  Wanger to Universal Pictures  Selznick to retirement  By the late 1940s  United Artists had virtually ceased to exist as either a producer or distributor  It sold off its Mexican releasing division to Cr dito Cinematogr fico Mexicano  a local company   edit  Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers  1940s and 1950s  The Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers was founded in 1941 by Mary Pickford  Charlie Chaplin  Walt Disney  Orson Welles  Samuel Goldwyn  David O  Selznick  Alexander Korda  and Walter Wanger   many of the same people who were members of United Artists  Later members included Hunt Stromberg  William Cagney  Sol Lesser  and Hal Roach  The Society aimed to advance the interests of independent producers in an industry overwhelmingly controlled by the studio system  SIMPP also fought to end ostensibly anti competitive practices by the seven major film studios   Loew s  Columbia Pictures  Paramount Pictures  Universal Pictures  RKO Radio Pictures  20th Century Fox  and Warner Bros  First National   that controlled the production  distribution  and exhibition of films  In 1942  the SIMPP filed an antitrust suit against Paramount s United Detroit Theatres  The complaint accused Paramount of conspiracy to control first run and subsequent run theaters in Detroit  It was the first antitrust suit brought by producers against exhibitors alleging monopoly and restraint of trade  In 1948  the U S  Supreme Court Paramount Decision ordered the major Hollywood movie studios   Loew s MGM  Paramount  Warner Bros  First National  20th Century Fox and RKO   to sell their theater chains and to eliminate certain anti competitive practices  This effectively brought an end to the studio system  By 1958  many of the objectives that led to the creation of the SIMPP had been obtained and SIMPP closed its offices   edit  The 1950s and 1960s This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  On February 16  1951  two lawyers turned producers Arthur Krim  of Eagle Lion Films  and Robert Benjamin approached Pickford and Chaplin with a wild idea  let them take over United Artists for five years  If  at the end of those five years  UA was profitable  they would be given an option to buy the company  Since UA was barely alive  Pickford saw nothing to lose and agreed  Chaplin was against the deal  but changed his mind in late 1952 when the US government revoked his re entry visa while he was in London for the UK premiere of Limelight  He sold his remaining shares of UA several years later  1967 1968 UA Logo In taking over UA  Krim and Benjamin created the first studio without an actual  studio   Primarily acting as bankers  they offered money to independent producers  UA leased space at the Pickford Fairbanks Studio  but did not own a studio lot as such  Thus UA did not have the overhead  the maintenance  or the expensive production staff that ran up costs at other studios  Among their first clients were Sam Spiegel and John Huston  whose  Horizon Productions  gave UA one major hit  The African Queen  1951  and one slightly less successful one  Moulin Rouge  1952   based on the life of Toulouse Lautrec  Others followed  among them Stanley Kramer  Otto Preminger  Hill Hecht Lancaster Productions  and a number of actors  newly freed from studio contracts and anxious to produce or direct their own films  UA production head Arnold Picker selected the properties the company would back  With UA s new success  Pickford saw a chance to exit gracefully  though she still held out for top dollar  walking away with  1 5 million in 1955  That same year  UA won its first Best Picture Oscar  for the film Marty  It starred Ernest Borgnine  who won a Best Actor Oscar for his performance  UA went public the following year  and as the other mainstream studios fell into decline  UA prospered  adding relationships with the Mirisch brothers  Billy Wilder  Joseph E  Levine and others  In 1961  United Artists released West Side Story  an adaptation of the Leonard Bernstein Stephen Sondheim stage musical  which won a record ten Academy Awards  including Best Picture   In 1958 United Artists Records was created  initially to release soundtracks from UA films  but it later diversified into many types of music  In 1968  UA Records was merged with Liberty Records  along with their many subsidiary labels such as Imperial Records and Dolton Records  In 1972 the group was consolidated into one entity as United Artists Records  It was later taken over by EMI  Also in 1958 UA acquired Ilya Lopert s Lopert Pictures Corporation a company that released foreign films in the United States to release foreign films that may have attracted criticism or cause censorship problems  5  In 1964 UA released the controversial Billy Wilder American made film Kiss Me  Stupid under the Lopert name  Lopert later became vice president of United Artists in Paris  In 1959  United Artists offered its first ever television series  The Troubleshooters  after failing to sell several pilots in the previous few years   an adventure drama on NBC  starring Keenan Wynn and Bob Mathias  as employees of an international construction company  6  In 1960  United Artists purchased Ziv Television Programs and  using the idea of financial backing for television  UA s television division was responsible for shows such as CBS s Gilligan s Island and three ABC programs  The Fugitive with David Janssen  Outer Limits  a science fiction series  and The Patty Duke Show with Patty Duke and William Schallert  The television unit also had begun to build up a substantial   and profitable   rental library  having purchased Associated Artists Productions  owners of Warner Bros  pre 1950 7  8  features  shorts and cartoons  as well as the Popeye cartoons  purchased from Paramount Pictures a few years earlier   See note below at Film archives for more on this   In 1963 United Artists released two Stanley Kramer films  the epic comedy It s A Mad  Mad  Mad  Mad World and the drama A Child is Waiting  In 1964  UA introduced U S  film audiences to The Beatles by releasing producer Walter Shenson s A Hard Day s Night  1964  and Help   1965    The group had already made wildly successful television appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show   At the same time it backed two expatriate North Americans in Britain  who had acquired screen rights to Ian Fleming s James Bond novels  For  1 million  UA backed Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli s Dr  No  which was a sensation in 1962  and launched the James Bond series  The franchise has outlived UA s time as a major studio  still running half a century later  Other successful projects backed in this period included Blake Edwards s Pink Panther series  which began in 1964  and Sergio Leone s Spaghetti Westerns  which made a star of Clint Eastwood  In 1964  the French subsidiary Les Productions Artistes Associ s released its first production  That Man From Rio  On the basis of its fantastic string of film and television hits in the 1960s  the company was an attractive property  and in 1967 Krim and Benjamin sold control of UA to the San Francisco based insurance giant  Transamerica Corp  UA released another Best Picture Oscar winner in 1967  In the Heat of the Night  starring Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger  and a nominee for Best Picture  The Graduate  an Embassy production that UA distributed

removed   January 2009  United Artists opening and closing logo  1971 1981  From 1981 to 1982  it was just United Artists on a black screen with no Transamerica indicator  For a time the flow of successful pictures continued  including the 1971 screen version of Fiddler on the Roof   However  the 1972 film version of Man of La Mancha was a failure   New talent was encouraged  including Woody Allen  Robert Altman  Sylvester Stallone  Saul Zaentz  Milo  Forman  and Brian De Palma  In 1973  UA took over the sales and distribution of MGM s films in Anglo America  while Cinema International Corporation took over international distribution rights  In 1975  Harry Saltzman sold UA his 50  stake in Danjaq  LLC  the holding company for the Bond films  UA was to remain a silent partner  putting up money  while Albert Broccoli took producer credit  Danjaq and UA have remained the public co copyright holders for the Bond series ever since  and the 2006 Casino Royale release shares the copyright with Columbia Pictures  part of the consortium that now owns MGM UA  However  Transamerica was not pleased with UA s frequent releases of films rated X by the Motion Picture Association of America  such as Midnight Cowboy and Last Tango in Paris  in these instances  Transamerica demanded the byline  A Transamerica Company  be removed from the UA logo on the prints and in all advertising  At one point  the parent company expressed their desire to phase out the UA name and replace it with Transamerica Films  Finally in 1978  following a dispute over administrative expenses  UA s top executives  including Arthur B  Krim  chairman  Eric Pleskow  president and chief executive officer  Robert S  Benjamin  chairman of the finance committee  walked out  Within days they announced the formation of Orion Pictures  with backing from Warner  Orion would eventually be a part of MGM along with United Artists  while Warner retained the rights to the pre 1982 Orion library along with acquiring the rights to a few post 1982 Orion films   The departures of Krim  Pleskow and Benjamin concerned several Hollywood figures enough that they took out an ad in a trade paper warning Transamerica that it had made a fatal mistake in letting them go   edit  The Heaven s Gate fiasco The new leadership of UA agreed to back Heaven s Gate  the pet project of director Michael Cimino  who had won Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director for his 1978 film The Deer Hunter  A western starring Kris Kristofferson and Christopher Walken  Heaven s Gate had an unusually protracted shooting schedule  Cimino reportedly wanted 50 takes for a single scene  for instance  which generated adverse publicity about runaway costs and Cimino s autocratic style  The almost four hour film opened to scathing reviews and alienated audiences  Cimino pulled it in favor of a 149 minute version  but the damage was done  It turned out to be a colossal box office bomb  netting only  3 million in earnings compared to a budget of  44 million  United Artists recorded a major loss for the year due almost entirely to the Heaven s Gate fiasco  To Transamerica  it was only a blip on a multi billion dollar balance sheet  but it soured the relationship forever  To the greater Hollywood community  it also signaled that UA was a company that could no longer produce bankable pictures  The Heaven s Gate fiasco may have saved the United Artists brand as UA s final head before the sale  Steven Bach  wrote in his book Final Cut that there was talk about renaming United Artists to Transamerica Pictures  Despite the financial ruin  UA s blockbuster franchise films  Pink Panther  James Bond  and eventually Rocky  were emphasized more heavily than the financially unsuccessful films   edit  United Artists Classics In 1981  United Artists Classics  which had formerly been a division of the company that re released library titles  was turned into a first run art film distributor by Nathaniel T  Kwit Jr  Tom Bernard was hired as the division s head of sales  and Ira Deutchman 9  10  11  as its head of marketing  Later the division added Michael Barker and Donna Gigliotti  Deutchman left to form Cinecom  and Barker and Bernard later went on to form Orion Classics and Sony Pictures Classics  The label mostly released foreign and independent films such as Ticket to Heaven and The Grey Fox  and occasional first run reissues from the UA library  such as director s cuts of Joan Micklin Silver s Head Over Heels and Ivan Passer s Cutter s Way  When Barker  and Bernard left to form Orion  the label was briefly rechristened MGM UA Classics before it was finally shut down in the late 1980s  United Artists opening logo  1982 1987  This logo also would replace the Transamerica  T  from most pre 1981 prints   edit  The 1980s and 1990s  MGM UA Around 1980  Transamerica was retiring from the filmmaking business  and United Artists was put up for sale  MGM  led by Kirk Kerkorian  the company that United Artists had a 10 year distribution deal since 1974   made a bid for UA by estimating that MGM would pay UA  350 million in distribution fees if the expiring distribution deal was renewed and used the estimated amount to offer the  350 million 12  to Transamerica to buy United Artists  Transamerica said yes and MGM absorbed UA  The studio  which was essentially bankrupt following the disaster of Heaven s Gate  cut its production schedule sharply  MGM and UA were merged into MGM UA Entertainment Co  from 1981 to 1986  Because MGM was not able to drop out from CIC  which distributed MGM s films outside Anglo America  which joined in 1973  UA s international operations were merged with CIC  eventually becoming United International Pictures  MGM UA would drop out from the venture in 2000  as its films were released internationally by 20th Century Fox  UA was essentially dormant after 1990  releasing no films for several years  In part this was due to the continuing turmoil at MGM UA  bought by Ted Turner in 1986  he could not get financial backing to complete the deal and  seventy four days later  re sold UA and the MGM trademark to Kerkorian  sold the MGM studio lot to Lorimar  now the location of Sony Pictures Studios  while keeping the MGM UA library for himself  with the exception of those MGM UA releases by United Artists    See below for a note on the film library   As a result of the MGM split from Turner  United Artists and what was left of MGM UA  at the time called MGM Entertaiment Co   was subsequently reorganized  and changed its name to MGM UA Communications Co  after Kerkorian bought back the MGM trademark  As a result  both MGM and UA became merely brands of MGM UA Communications Co  In 1988  a planned  400 million split between MGM and UA was announced by Kerkorian  He hoped to end up with at least 57  of the new MGM and retain its share of UA  at the time called United Artists Pictures  Inc    25  of MGM would go to a company controlled by Burt Sugarman and producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber  and 18  would be offered for sale to public holders of MGM UA stock  but the plan fell through  Around this time  Viacom  Gannett  Disney  Republic Pictures  General Electric  CBS  Time Inc   Hearst  News Corporation  TCI  Globo of Brazil  Aaron Spelling s Spelling Entertainment and Sony all tried to purchase MGM UA  Nevertheless  the studio was able to manage box office hits such as Rain Man  winner of the 1988 Oscar for Best Picture   Baby Boom  and The Living Daylights  However  during this period  the company s fortunes languished greatly  losing money while its market share declined to 8  by the end of the 1980s  The sale of MGM UA to an Australian company Qintex Australian Television Network  owners of the Hal Roach library both MGM and UA distributed in the 1930s  in 1989 also fell through  due to the company s bankruptcy later that year  Eventually  in 1990  came the sale to Italian promoter Giancarlo Parretti who purchased Path  the previous year and merged MGM UA with the former company  resulting into MGM Path  Communications Co  Having bought MGM UA by overstating his own financial condition  within a year Parretti had defaulted to his primary bank  Cr dit Lyonnais  which foreclosed on the studio in 1992  also resulting in the sale orclosure of MGM UA s string of US theaters  On July 2  1992  MGM Path  Communications Co  was renamed to Metro Goldwyn Mayer  Inc  In an effort to make MGM UA saleable  Credit Lyonnais ramped up production  reviving two long running franchises  the Pink Panther and James Bond films  MGM was sold in 1996  again to Kirk Kerkorian   edit  The 2000s During the 2000s  UA was repositioned as a specialty studio  MGM had just acquired The Samuel Goldwyn Company  which had been a leading distributor of arthouse films  and after that name was retired  UA assumed SGC s purpose  The distributorship  branding  and copyrights for UA s main franchises  James Bond  Pink Panther  and Rocky  were moved to MGM  although select MGM releases  notably the James Bond franchise co held with Danjaq  LLC and the Amityville Horror remake  carry a United Artists copyright  UA  re christened United Artists Films  distributed a few  art house  films  among them Michael Moore s Bowling for Columbine  2002 s Nicholas Nickleby and the winner of that year s Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film  No Man s Land  and 2004 s Hotel Rwanda  a co production of UA and Lions Gate Entertainment  On April 8  2005  a partnership of Comcast  Sony and several merchant banks bought United Artists and its parent  MGM  for a total of  4 8 billion  In March 2006  MGM announced that it would return once again as a distribution company domestically  Striking distribution deals with The Weinstein Company  Lakeshore Entertainment  Bauer Martinez Entertainment and other independent studios  MGM distributes films from these companies  MGM continues funding and co producing projects that are released in conjunction with Sony s Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group on a limited basis and is producing  tentpoles  for their own distribution company MGM Distribution  Sony has a minority stake in MGM but otherwise MGM and UA will operate under the direction of Stephen Cooper  CEO of MGM and a minority owner himself    edit  The Tom Cruise era On November 2  2006  MGM announced that actor Tom Cruise and his long time production partner Paula Wagner were resurrecting UA 13  14   this announcement came after the duo were released from a fourteen year production relationship at Viacom owned Paramount Pictures earlier that year   Cruise  Wagner and MGM Studios created United Artists Entertainment LLC and the producer actor and his partner owned a 30  stake in the studio  15  with the approval by MGM s consortium of owners  The deal gave them control over production and development of films  Wagner was named CEO of United Artists  which was allotted an annual slate of four films with different budget ranges  while Cruise serves as a producer for the revamped studio as well as serving as the occasional star  UA became the first motion picture studio granted a WGA waiver in January 2008 during the Writers  Strike  16  On August 14  2008  MGM announced Paula Wagner will leave United Artists to produce films independently  2  Her output as head of UA was two films  both starring Cruise  Lions for Lambs 17  and Valkyrie  which despite mixed reviews was successful at the box office  18  Wagner s departure led to speculation that an overhaul at United Artists was imminent  2  Since then  United Artists has merely served as a co producer with MGM for two releases  the 2009 remake of Fame and Hot Tub Time Machine  Throughout 2010  continued debt and credit issues for MGM Holdings  Inc   United Artists  parent company had left the future of MGM and UA in doubt until it was resolved near the end of the year  A 2011 financial report revealed that MGM reacquired its 100  stake in United Artists  15  MGM might continue to make new films under the UA brand  15   edit  Historical list of films List of

Few studios had the foresight or ability to maintain control over every picture they produced or released  United Artists  through various strategic purchases  built up a substantial film and television library  Included were rights not only to some of UA s own releases  but to the RKO and pre 1950 7  8  Warner Bros  libraries  Having passed through numerous hands  these catalogs now belong to Time Warner s Turner Entertainment unit  Since UA produced very few of the pictures it released  the copyrights of UA s output up until the 1970s belonged to the individual or company producing  UA managed to acquire full rights to a majority of these films later on  MGM Path   now simply known as MGM  or  for legal purposes  Metro Goldwyn Mayer Studios   took over the copyrights to UA films  particularly the in house productions  after the studio folded into the former company in 1990  Productions made after the company was revived by MGM in 1994 are copyrighted by UA  Still  the rights to many UA releases around this time reverted back to the producers  Some UA films of the 1930s  1940s and early 1950s fell into the public domain  to be picked up by Republic Pictures  today part of Paramount Pictures  or studios like Westchester Films  successor to Castle Hill Productions   and Classic Media  in most cases with distribution by Warner Brothers   A small fraction of UA s silent output is now owned by Kino International  A number of United Artists  films from the 1920s through the 1940s that are in the public domain are seldom shown  Of the hundreds of films UA distributed over eighty years  those it still owns outright are most of its own productions from 1951 forward  plus a few pre 1951 films such as 1933 s Hallelujah  I m a Bum and Howard Hawks  Red River  1948  with parent company MGM handling distribution  Until the early  90s  many of those films were released on home video by Magnetic Video  which later became CBS Fox Video  in the United States and Canada and by Warner Home Video internationally   edit  The Big Four  Chaplin  Pickford  Fairbanks and Griffith  Charlie Chaplin s films  features and shorts are controlled by his estate  with most rights handled by French distributor MK2 and Janus Films  Most of the films Douglas Fairbanks and D W  Griffith made at United Artists now rest with film restoration company Film Preservation Associates  In 1931  Mary Pickford considered destroying her films  afraid they might seem ridiculous to future generations of viewers  however  her friend Lillian Gish managed to persuade her otherwise  19  20  The rights to all of her films are now held by the Mary Pickford Foundation   edit  Disney  Lantz  and Twentieth Century Pictures  productions All of the Disney shorts released through United Artists from June 1932 to May 1937  as well as the 1943 film Victory Through Air Power  were always owned by The Walt Disney Company  A number of these had been re released through RKO  replacing the original titles  prior to the launch of Buena Vista Distribution in 1953  All of the Walter Lantz cartoons distributed by UA during 1947 up to 1949 are now held by Lantz s original home  Universal  The Twentieth Century pictures released by UA between 1933 and 1935 rest with the successor company  20th Century Fox   edit  Collaborations Films made by UA in co production with other companies rest with several studios in certain territories or under contractual agreements  As of the present  UA owns domestic distribution  including television syndication  theatrical  and internet  and the copyright to The Return of the Pink Panther  All other rights reside under Universal Pictures  Focus Features division in partnership with ITC and its successor ITV Global Entertainment Ltd   Ironically  MGM UA s rights are the result of their theatrical distribution license for the ITC ITV library  In another twist of irony  UA also owns theatrical distribution rights to the 1978 remake of The Big Sleep  another ITC production originally released by UA  by virtue of MGM s distribution rights to ITC s theatrical output  Worldwide rights to Always are now with Universal Pictures  the film s co producing studio  Most ancillary rights to Convoy  an EMI Films production  are now with EMI s successor company  StudioCanal  although its copyright and US home video re release issues are with MGM  but an official home video DVD re issue has yet to be announced   edit  Independent producers Rights to the UA released Hal Roach films are now with RHI Entertainment  even though most of these are in the public domain  McLintock   made by John Wayne s Batjac Productions  is in the public domain  though the music score is still under copyright   Batjac retains the original film elements  and licensed Paramount Home Entertainment the distribution rights to release DVD versions authorized by Batjac and Wayne s estate  Rights to the UA distributed Hopalong Cassidy films are held by the late William Boyd s company  U S  Television Office  Rights to Stanley Kramer s pre 1952 productions for UA  ex  Champion  The Men  High Noon   as well as a majority of the films made by Enterprise Productions  ex  Body and Soul  Arch of Triumph  are currently owned by Republic Pictures under Paramount  with Trifecta handling television syndication and Lionsgate holding video DVD rights  Another Kramer production  the 1950 film version of Cyrano de Bergerac  is in the public domain  Rights to the The Caddo Company Howard Hughes films produced by UA are now owned by Universal  except for a few like Two Arabian Knights and The Front Page  which are in the public domain  home video rights rest with independent home video distributors like Flicker Alley and Reelclassicdvd com   The pre 1941 Samuel Goldwyn films released by UA  as well as the films made during his tenure at RKO  were temporarily handled by The Samuel Goldwyn Company  with HBO Home Video handling home entertainment rights  but are currently held by successor company MGM  ironically also the parent company of UA   which predecessor company Goldwyn Pictures Corporation feuded with for years  The U S  rights to The African Queen are now owned by Paramount Pictures  after years of changing hands as the result of a series of management changes involving Paramount s parent company Viacom   As of the present  Paramount handles theatrical distribution  while Trifecta Entertainment  amp  Media manages television syndication under Paramount s license  ITV Global Entertainment Ltd  handles distribution outside the U S  Ancillary rights to The Final Countdown are now with Lionsgate  successor in interest to Producers Sales Organization   however the video rights are held by Blue Underground  Lionsgate also now owns US DVD rights to Francis Ford Coppola s Apocalypse Now  under license from Paramount Pictures  which owns US distribution rights on behalf of the film s rights holder  American Zoetrope  Coppola s company   Trifecta  also under license from Paramount  handles television distribution rights  International distribution rights have been farmed out to other companies  in some countries  the original and  Redux  versions have different distributors   Rights to Mike Todd s Around the World in Eighty Days and the UA distributed Lorimar films are now with Warner Bros   Warner Communications bought the rights to Days from Elizabeth Taylor  Todd s widow  and successor company Time Warner bought the Lorimar library after they bought out the company in 1990  Saul Zaentz and his namesake corporation retains the rights to his UA distributed productions  which includes One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest and Ralph Bakshi s 1978 animated film The Lord of the Rings  Zaentz licensed the distribution of these films to Warner Bros  Several of Otto Preminger s UA films remain under the control of his estate  with Warner Bros  distributing  However  Preminger s The Man With the Golden Arm is no longer under copyright  though the music score still is   Rights to the Mexican films originally released by UA are now with Laguna Films  while others are in the public domain or owned by independent companies  That s because the US copyright laws did not apply worldwide  The 1951 film version of Scrooge is now held by its original production company  Renown Film Productions  with VCI Entertainment handling video rights   edit  The Selznick library Rights to Selznick International Pictures and other later productions from David O  Selznick are held by ABC  which is also owned by Disney   Home video rights are held by MGM under license  This excludes Gone with the Wind  which was originally released by Metro Goldwyn Mayer  and is now owned by Time Warner  via subsidiary Turner Entertainment Company  with TW s Warner Bros  unit holding distribution rights  Like Gone with the Wind  The Prisoner of Zenda  1937  is also owned by Turner  Unlike the case of Gone with the Wind  which Selznick sold to MGM in 1944  It is assumed that The Prisoner of Zenda was bought by MGM themselves because they planned to produce a would be 1952 remake of the film and wished to better the original film  a similar situation occurred when MGM filmed a version of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde in 1941  having also bought the 1931 version from Paramount   When the pre May 1986 MGM library was bought by Turner Entertainment  both productions were included in the roster as well  Little Lord Fauntleroy  1936   Nothing Sacred  1937   A Star is Born  1937  and Made for Each Other are now in the public domain   edit  Pre May 1986 MGM UA library The pre May 1986 MGM films released through United Artists  and outside Anglo America through Cinema International Corporation and United International Pictures  are also now with WB Turner Entertainment  Some of the pre May 1986 MGM UA films made around the early 1980s still remain in the MGM library and were not picked up by Turner Entertainment due to most of these films produced by UA  ex   Don Bluth s 1982 animated film The Secret of NIMH  the 1983 film WarGames  the foreign rights to the 1976 Sidney Lumet film Network and the James Bond  Pink Panther and Rocky franchises   However  a specific film from the official UA library  the 1937 film The Prisoner of Zenda  has managed to enter the Turner library  thus part of the Warner catalogs   See above  One WB film in the a a p  package  Rope  had its rights reverted to director Alfred Hitchcock in later years  His estate then sold the rights to Universal Studios in 1983  The 1975 documentary  Bugs Bunny  Superstar  is also now with WB Turner  as it featured several full cartoons in the a a p  package  Most of the a a p  library  The Popeye cartoons and most of the pre 1950 Warner Bros  library  are owned by WB Turner  The only exception is Rope    edit  The Beatles  films Rights to A Hard Day s Night  1964  are controlled by The Weinstein Company  in conjunction with Miramax Films and Lionsgate  the latter company currently holding home video rights under Miramax   The rights to Help   1965  and Let It Be  1970   also distributed by UA  are now owned by the surviving members of The Beatles and the estates of the deceased members through Apple Corps  with licensing from EMI  Yellow Submarine  1968  is owned by Subafilms  the Beatles  production company  MGM continued to distribute the film for many years  however Capitol Records assumed video distribution for a Blu Ray release in 2012   edit  United Artists Television Further information  United Artists Television  edit  UA Films on video United Artists originally leased the home video rights to its films  including the pre 1950 Warner Bros  classics they owned at the time  to Magnetic Video  the first home video company  Magnetic was purchased by 20th Century Fox in 1981 and was renamed 20th Century Fox Video that year  In 1982  20th Century Fox Video merged with CBS Video Enterprises  which had demerged with MGM CBS Home Video after MGM merged with UA  giving birth to CBS Fox Video  Although MGM owned UA around this time  the latter studio s licensing deal with CBS Fox was still in effect  however  the newly renamed MGM UA Home Video started releasing some UA product  including a few recent films  In 1986  the pre 1950 WB and the pre May 1986 MGM film and television libraries were purchased by Ted Turner after its short lived ownership of MGM UA  and as a result CBS Fox lost home video rights to the pre 1950 WB films to MGM UA Home Video  When the deal with CBS Fox  inherited from Magnetic Video  expired in 1989  the UA films began to be issued through MGM UA Home Video  Up until then  international distribution was handled by Warner Home Video  including in the UK  Europe  Japan  and South America  In the late 1980s  UA licensed the video releases for its more obscure titles to a small specialty video distributor called Wood Knapp Video  This deal lasted in effect until the early 1990s   edit  United Artists Broadcasting United Artists owned and operated two television stations between the
