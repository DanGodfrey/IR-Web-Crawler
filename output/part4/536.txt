comprised money  industrial output  food  petroleum  technological innovation  and  especially 1944 45   soldiers  Much of the focus in Washington was maximizing the economic output of the nation  The overall result was a dramatic increase in GDP  the export of vast quantities of supplies to the Allies and to American forces overseas  the end of unemployment  and a rise in civilian consumption even as 40  of the GDP went to the war effort  This was achieved by tens of millions of workers moving from low productivity occupations to high efficiency jobs  improvements in productivity through better technology and management  and the move into the active labor force of students  retired people  housewives  and the unemployed  and an increase in hours worked  It was exhausting  leisure activities declined sharply  People tolerated the extra work because of patriotism  the pay  and the confidence it was only  for the duration  and life would return to normal as soon as the war was won  Most durable goods became unavailable  and meat  clothing  and gasoline were tightly rationed  In industrial areas housing was in short supply as people doubled up and lived in cramped quarters  Prices and wages were controlled  and Americans saved a high portion of their incomes  which led to renewed growth after the war instead of a return to depression  1  2   edit  Taxes and controls Federal tax policy was highly contentious during the war  with President Franklin D  Roosevelt battling a conservative Congress  However  both sides agreed on the need for high taxes  along with heavy borrowing  to pay for the war  Roosevelt tried unsuccessfully to impose a 100  tax on incomes over  25 000  equal to  335 769 today   Congress enlarged the tax base by lowering the minimum income to pay taxes  By 1944 nearly every employed person was paying federal income taxes  compared to 10  in 1940   3  Many controls were put on the economy  The most important were price controls  imposed on most products and monitored by the Office of Price Administration  Wages were also controlled  4  Corporations dealt with numerous agencies  especially the War production Board  WPB   and the War and Navy departments  which had the purchasing power and priorities that largely reshaped and expanded industrial production  5   edit  Rationing Main article  Rationing United States In 1942 a rationing system was begun to guarantee minimum amounts of necessities to everyone  especially poor people  and prevent inflation  Tires were the first item to be rationed in January 1942 because supplies of natural rubber were interrupted  Gasoline rationing proved an even better way to allocate scarce rubber  By 1943 one needed government issued ration coupons to purchase typewriters  coffee  sugar  gasoline  bicycles  clothing  fuel oil  silk  nylon  stoves  shoes  meat  cheese  butter  lard  margarine  canned foods  dried fruits  jam  and many other items  Some items like new automobiles and appliances were no longer made  The rationing system did not apply to used goods  like clothes or cars   To get a classification and a book of rationing stamps  one had to appear before a local rationing board  Each person in a household received a ration book  including babies and children  When purchasing gasoline  a driver had to present a gas card along with a ration book and cash  Ration stamps were valid only for a set period to forestall hoarding  All forms of automobile racing were banned  including Indianapolis  Sightseeing driving was banned  too   edit  Personal savings Personal income was at an all time high  and more dollars were chasing fewer goods to purchase  This was a recipe for economic disaster that was largely avoided because Americans cajoled daily by their government to do so were also saving money at an all time high rate  mostly in War Bonds but also in private savings accounts and insurance policies  Consumer saving was strongly encouraged through investment in War bonds that would mature after the war  Most workers had an automatic payroll deduction  children collected savings stamps until they had enough to buy a bond  Bond rallies were held throughout the U S  with famous celebrities  usually Hollywood film stars  to enhance the bond advertising effectiveness  Several stars were responsible for personal appearance tours that netted multiple millions of dollars in bond pledges an astonishing amount in 1943  The public paid 3 4 of the face value of a war bond  and received the full face value back after a set number of years  This shifted their consumption from the war to postwar  and allowed over 40  of GDP to go to military spending  with moderate inflation  6  Americans were challenged to put  at least 10  of every paycheck into Bonds   Compliance was very high  with entire factories of workers earning a special  Minuteman  flag to fly over their plant if all workers belonged to the  Ten Percent Club   There were seven major War Loan drives  all of which exceeded their goals  7   edit  Labor  Rosie the Riveter   working on an A 31  Vengeance  dive bomber  Tennessee  1943  The unemployment problem ended in the United States with the preparations leading up to World War II  Greater wartime production created millions of new jobs  while the draft reduced the number of young men available for civilian jobs  So great was the demand for labor that millions of retired people  housewives  and students entered the labor force  lured by patriotism and wages  8  The shortage of grocery clerks caused some stores to convert from service at the counter to self service and to lower shelves to 5 feet 8 inches  1 73 m   allegedly the height that a woman could reach  Before the war most groceries  dry cleaners  drugstores  and department stores offered home delivery service  The labor shortage and gasoline and tire rationing caused many stores to stop delivery  They found that requiring customers to buy their products in person increased sales  9  130 132  edit  Women Women also joined the workforce to replace men who had joined the forces  though in fewer numbers  Roosevelt stated that the efforts of civilians at home to support the war through personal sacrifice was as critical to winning the war as the efforts of the soldiers themselves   Rosie the Riveter  became the symbol of women laboring in manufacturing  The war effort brought about significant changes in the role of women in society as a whole  At the end of the war  many of the munitions factories closed  Other women were replaced by returning veterans  However most women who wanted to continue working did so  Young daughters of these working women learned that to be a working woman was a normal part of life and later many of these daughters also became working women  In the figure below the development of the United States labor force by gender during the war years  10  Year Total labor force   1000  of

exemption and few were drafted  Large numbers volunteered or moved to cities for factory jobs  At the same time many agricultural commodities were in greater demand by the military and for the civilian populations of Allies  Production was encouraged and prices and markets were under tight federal control  11  The Bracero Program  a bi national labor agreement between Mexico and the United States  started in 1942  Braceros   strong arms   in Spanish  were recruited and contracted to work in the agriculture fields  More than 20  of all Mexican workers  46 954 of 220 640  who came to the United States between 1943 and 1947 were contracted to work in the Pacific Northwest  12  Between 1942 and 1946 some 425 000 Italian and German prisoners of war were used as farm laborers  loggers and cannery workers  In Michigan  for example  the POWs accounted for more than one third of the state s agricultural production and food processing in 1944  13   edit  Teenagers With the war s ever increasing need for able bodied men consuming America s labor force in the early 1940s  industry turned to teen aged boys and girls to fill in as replacements  14  Consequently  many states had to change their child labor laws to allow these teenagers to work  The lures of patriotism  adulthood and money led many youth to drop out of school and take a defense job  Between 1940 and 1944  the number of teenage workers increased by 1 9 million  and the number of students in public high schools dropped from 6 6 million in 1940 to 5 6 million in 1944  as a million students and many teachers took jobs  15   edit  Labor unions Welder making boilers for a ship  Combustion Engineering Co   Chattanooga  Tennessee  June 1942  The war mobilization changed the relationship of the Congress of Industrial Organizations  CIO  with both employers and the national government  16  Both the CIO and the larger American Federation of Labor  AFL  grew rapidly in the war years  17  Nearly all the unions that belonged to the CIO were fully supportive of both the war effort and of the Roosevelt administration  However the United Mine Workers  who had taken an isolationist stand in the years leading up to the war and had opposed Roosevelt s reelection in 1940  left the CIO in 1942  The major unions supported a wartime no strike pledge that aimed to eliminate not only major strikes for new contracts  but also the innumerable small strikes called by shop stewards and local union leadership to protest particular grievances  In return for labor s no strike pledge  the government offered arbitration to determine the wages and other terms of new contracts  Those procedures produced modest wage increases during the first few years of the war but not enough to keep up with inflation  particularly when combined with the slowness of the arbitration machinery  18  Even though the complaints from union members about the no strike pledge became louder and more bitter  the CIO did not abandon it  The Mine Workers  by contrast  who did not belong to either the AFL or the CIO for much of the war  threatened numerous strikes including a successful twelve day strike in 1943  The strikes and threats made mine leader John L  Lewis a much hated man and led to legislation hostile to unions  19  All the major unions grew stronger during the war  The government put pressure on employers to recognize unions to avoid the sort of turbulent struggles over union recognition of the 1930s  while unions were generally able to obtain maintenance of membership clauses  a form of union security  through arbitration and negotiation  Employers gave workers new untaxed benefits  such as vacation time  pensions and health insurance   which increased real incomes even when wage rates were frozen  20  The wage differential between higher skilled and less skilled workers narrowed  and with the enormous increase in overtime for blue collar wage workers  at time and a half pay   incomes in working class households shot up  while the salaried middle class lost ground  The experience of bargaining on a national basis  while restraining local unions from striking  also tended to accelerate the trend toward bureaucracy within the larger CIO unions  Some  such as the Steelworkers  had always been centralized organizations in which authority for major decisions resided at the top  The UAW  by contrast  had always been a more grassroots organization  but it also started to try to rein in its maverick local leadership during these years  21  The CIO also had to confront deep racial divides in its own membership  particularly in the UAW plants in Detroit where white workers sometimes struck to protest the promotion of black workers to production jobs  but also in shipyards in Alabama  mass transit in Philadelphia  and steel plants in Baltimore  The CIO leadership  particularly those in further left unions such as the Packinghouse Workers  the UAW  the NMU and the Transport Workers  undertook serious efforts to suppress hate strikes  to educate their membership and to support the Roosevelt Administration s tentative efforts to remedy racial discrimination in war industries through the Fair Employment Practices Commission  Those unions contrasted their relatively bold attack on the problem with the timidity and racism of the AFL  22  The CIO unions were progressive in dealing with gender discrimination in wartime industry  which now employed many more women workers in nontraditional jobs  Unions that had represented large numbers of women workers before the war  such as the UE clarification needed  and the Food and Tobacco Workers  had fairly good records of fighting discrimination against women  Most union leaders saw women as temporary wartime replacements for the men in the armed forces  It was important that the wages of these women be kept high so that the veterans would get high wages  23   edit  Civilian support for war effort See also  United States civil defense World War II and American Theater  1939 1945  Atlantic Ocean A synagogue on West Twenty Third Street in New York City remained open 24 hours on D Day for special services and prayer  Early in the war  it became apparent that German U boats were using the backlighting of coastal cities in Eastern and Southern United States to destroy ships exiting harbors  It became the first duties of civilians recruited for local civilian defense to ensure that lights were either off or thick curtains drawn over all windows at night  The Civil Air Patrol was established  which enrolled civilian spotters in air reconnaissance  search and rescue  and transport  Its Coast Guard counterpart  the Coast Guard Auxiliary  used civilian boats and crews in similar roles  Towers were built in coastal and border towns  and spotters were trained to recognize enemy aircraft  Blackouts were practiced in every city  even those far from the coast  All exterior lighting had to be extinguished  and black out curtains placed over windows  to avoid helping the enemy in targeting at night  The main purpose was to remind people that there was a war on and to provide activities that would engage the civil spirit of millions of people not otherwise involved in the war effort  In large part  this effort was successful  sometimes almost to a fault  such as the Plains states where many dedicated aircraft spotters took up their posts night after night watching the skies in an area of the country that no enemy aircraft of that time could possibly hope to reach  24  The United Service Organizations  USO  was founded in 1941 in response to a request from President Franklin D  Roosevelt to provide morale and recreation services to uniformed military personnel  This request led six civilian agencies the Salvation Army  Young Men s Christian Association  Young Women s Christian Association  National Catholic Community Service  National Travelers Aid Association and the National Jewish Welfare Board to unite in support of the troops  The United Service Organizations  or USO  was incorporated in New York on February 4  1941  Legions of women previously employed only in the home  or in traditionally female work  took jobs in factories that directly supported the war effort  or filled jobs vacated by men who had entered military service  Various items  previously discarded  were saved after use for what was called  recycling  years later  Families were requested to save fat drippings from cooking for use in soap making  Neighborhood  scrap drives  collected scrap copper and brass for use in artillery shells  Milkweed was harvested by children ostensibly for lifejackets  25   edit  Draft A female factory worker in 1942  Fort Worth  Texas  Women entered the workforce as men were drafted into the armed forces  In 1940 Congress passed the first peace time draft legislation  which was led by Grenville Clark  It was renewed  by one vote  in summer 1941  It involved questions as to who should control the draft  the size of the army  and the need for deferments  The system worked through local draft boards comprising community leaders who were given quotas and then decided how to fill them  There was very little draft resistance  26  The nation went from a surplus manpower pool with high unemployment and relief in 1940 to a severe manpower shortage by 1943  Industry realized that the Army urgently desired production of essential war materials and foodstuffs more than soldiers   Large numbers of soldiers were not used until the invasion of Europe in summer 1944   In 1940 43 the Army often transferred soldiers to civilian status in the Enlisted Reserve Corps in order to increase production  Those transferred would return to work in essential industry  although they could be called back to active duty if the Army needed them  Others were discharged if their civilian work was deemed essential  There were instances of mass releases of men to increase production in various industries  Working men who has been classified 4F or otherwise ineligible for the draft took second jobs  citation needed  In the figure below an overview of the development of the United States labor force  the armed forces and unemployment during the war years  27  Year Total labor force   1000  Armed forces   1000  Unemployed   1000  Unemployment rate

60 970 3 450 2 270 3 9 One contentious issue involved the drafting of fathers  which was avoided as much as possible  The drafting of 18 year olds was desired by the military but vetoed by public opinion  Racial minorities were drafted at the same rate as Whites  and were paid the same  but blacks were kept in all black units  The experience of World War I regarding men needed by industry was particularly unsatisfactory too many skilled mechanics and engineers became privates  there is a possibly apocryphal story of a banker assigned as a baker due to a clerical error  noted by historian Lee Kennett in his book  G I    Farmers demanded and were generally given occupational deferments  many volunteered anyway  but those who stayed at home lost postwar veteran s benefits   Later in the war  in light of the tremendous amount of manpower that would be necessary for the invasion of France in 1944  many earlier deferment categories became draft eligible   edit  Disloyalty Civilian support for the war was widespread  with isolated cases of draft resistance  The FBI was already tracking elements that were suspected of loyalty to Germany  Japan or Italy  and many were arrested in the weeks after Pearl Harbor  7000 German and Italian aliens  who were not U S  citizens  were moved back from the West Coast  along with 100 000 of Japanese descent  Some enemy aliens were held without trial during the entire war  The U S  citizens accused of supporting Germany were given public trials  and often were freed  28  29  30   edit  Population movements There was large scale migration to industrial centers  especially on the West Coast  Millions of wives followed their husbands to military camps  Many new military training bases were established or enlarged  especially in the South  Large numbers of African Americans left the cotton fields and headed for the cities  Housing was increasingly difficult to find in industrial centers  as there was no new non military construction  Commuting by car was limited by gasoline rationing  People car pooled or took public transportation  which was seriously overcrowded  Trains were heavily booked  with uniformed military personnel taking priority  so people limited vacation and long distance travel   edit  Racial tensions The large scale movement of blacks from the rural South to defense centers in the North  and some in the South  led to small scale local confrontations over jobs and housing shortages  Washington feared a major race war  The cities were relatively peaceful  much feared large scale race riots did not happen  but there was small scale violence  as in the 1943 race riot in Detroit and the anti Mexican Zoot Suit Riots in Los Angeles in 1943  31   edit  Role of women Standlee  2010  argues that during the war the traditional gender division of labor changed somewhat  as the  home  or domestic female sphere expanded to include the  home front   Meanwhile the public sphere the male domain was redefined as the international stage of military action  32   edit  Employment Riveting team working on the cockpit shell of a C 47 transport at the plant of North American Aviation  Office of War Information photo by Alfred T  Palmer  1942  Woman aircraft worker checking assemblies  California  1942  Woman standing next to a wide range of tire sizes required by military aircraft  Women took on an active role in World War II 24  and took on many paid jobs in temporary new munitions factories and in old factories that had been converted from civilian products like automobiles  This was the  Rosie the Riveter  phenomenon  They also filled many traditionally female jobs that were created by the war boom as waitresses  for example  And they worked at jobs that previously had been held by men such as bank teller or shoe salesperson  Nearly one million women worked as so called  government girls   taking jobs in the federal government  mainly in Washington  DC  that had previously been held by men or were newly created to deal with the war effort  During World War II  women began to gain more respect and men realized that women actually could work outside of the home  They fought for equal pay and made a huge impact on the United States workforce  They began to take over  male  jobs and gained confidence in themselves  citation needed  In general  when they replaced men  they came with fewer skills  Industry retooled its machine jobs so that unskilled workers could handle them   This opened many jobs for men who had been unemployed in the 1930s   Some unions tried to maintain the same pay scale as men had because they expected men to resume their jobs after the war  At the Oak Ridge plant separating U 235 for the Manhattan Project  it was noted that the  hill billy  women operators employed by Tennessee Eastman outperformed the scientists first used on the calutrons  In 1944  unemployment hit an all time low of 1 2   33   edit  Volunteer activities Women staffed millions of jobs in community service roles  such as nursing  USO  34  and Red Cross  35  Unorganized women were encouraged to collect and turn in materials that were needed by the war effort  Women collected fats rendered during cooking  children formed balls of aluminum foil they peeled from chewing gum wrappers  and also created rubber band balls  which they contributed to the war effort  Hundreds of thousands of men joined civil defense units to prepare for disasters  such as enemy bombing  The Women Airforce Service Pilots  WASP  mobilized 1000 civilian women to fly new warplanes from the factories to airfields located on the east coast of the U S  They are important in gender history because flying a warplane had always been a male role  Unlike Russia  no American women flew warplanes in combat  36   edit  Baby boom Marriage and motherhood came back as prosperity empowered couples who had postponed marriage  The birth rate started shooting up in 1941  paused in 1944 45 as 12 million men were in uniform  then continued to soar until reaching a peak in the late 1950s  This was the  Baby Boom   In a New Deal like move  the federal government set up the  EMIC  program that provided free prenatal and natal care for the wives of servicemen below the rank of sergeant  Housing shortages  especially in the munitions centers  forced millions of couples to live with parents or in makeshift facilities  Little housing had been built in the Depression years  so the shortages grew steadily worse until about 1948  when a massive housing boom finally caught up with demand   After 1944 much of the new housing was supported by the G I  Bill   Federal law made it difficult to divorce absent servicemen  so the number of divorces peaked when they returned in 1946  In long range terms  divorce rates changed little  24   edit  Housewives Juggling their roles as mothers due to the Baby Boom and the jobs they filled while the men were at war  women strained to complete all tasks set before them  The war caused cutbacks in automobile and bus service  and migration from farms and towns to munitions centers  Those housewives who worked found the dual role difficult to handle  The worst psychological pressure came when sons  husbands  fathers  brothers and fiances were drafted and sent to faraway training camps  preparing for a war in which nobody knew how many would be killed  Millions of wives tried to relocate near their husbands  training camps  24   edit  Role of minorities  edit  FEPC The Fair Employment Practices Commission  FEPC  was a federal executive order requiring companies with government contracts not to discriminate on the basis of race or religion  It assisted African Americans in obtaining jobs in industry  Under pressure from A  Philip Randolph s growing March on Washington Movement  on June 25  1941  President Roosevelt created the Fair Employment Practices Committee  FEPC  by signing Executive Order 8802  It said  there shall be no discrimination in the employment of workers in defense industries or government because of race  creed  color  or national origin   In 1943 Roosevelt greatly strengthened FEPC with a new executive order   9346  It required that all government contracts have a non discrimination clause  FEPC was the most significant breakthrough ever for Blacks and women on the job front  During the war the federal government operated airfield  shipyards  supply centers  ammunition plants and other facilities that employed millions  FEPC rules applied and guaranteed equality of employment rights  These facilities shut down when the war ended  In the private sector the FEPC was generally successful in enforcing non discrimination in the North  it did not attempt to challenge segregation in the South  and in the border region its intervention led to hate strikes by angry white workers  37   edit  African American  Double V campaign Participants in the Double V campaign  1942  From the collection of the National Archives and Records Administration  The African American community in the United States resolved on a Double V Campaign  Victory over fascism abroad  and victory over discrimination at home  Large numbers migrated from poor Southern farms to munitions centers  Racial tensions were high in overcrowded cities like Chicago  Detroit and Harlem experienced race riots in 1943  38  Black newspapers created the Double V Campaign to build black morale and head off radical action  39  Most Black women had been farm laborers or domestics before the war  40  Despite discrimination and segregated facilities throughout the South  they escaped the cotton patch and took blue collar jobs in the cities  Working with the federal Fair Employment Practices Committee  the NAACP and CIO unions  these Black women fought a  Double V  campaign against the Axis abroad and against restrictive hiring practices at home  Their efforts redefined citizenship  equating their patriotism with war work  and seeking equal employment opportunities  government entitlements  and better working conditions as conditions appropriate for full citizens  41  In the South black women worked in segregated jobs  in the West and most of the North they were integrated  but wildcat strikes erupted in Detroit  Baltimore  and Evansville where white migrants from the South refused to work alongside black women  42  43   edit  Internment of Japanese Americans Main article  Japanese American internment In 1942 the War Department demanded that all enemy nationals be removed from war zones on the West Coast  The question became how to evacuate the estimated 120 000 people of Japanese citizenship living in California  Roosevelt looked at the secret evidence available to him  44  the Japanese in the Philippines had collaborated with the Japanese invasion troops  most of the adult Japanese in California had been strong supporters of Japan in the war against China  There was evidence of espionage compiled by code breakers that decrypted messages to Japan from agents in North America and Hawaii before and after the attack on Pearl Harbor  These MAGIC cables were kept secret from all but those with the highest clearance  such as Roosevelt  On February 19  1942  Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 which set up designated military areas  from which any or all persons may be excluded   The most controversial part of the order included American born children and youth who had dual U S  and Japanese citizenship  Germans and Italians were not interned shown from the  Korematsu v  United States  case  In February 1943  when activating the 442nd Regimental Combat Team a unit composed mostly of American born American citizens of Japanese descent living in Hawaii Roosevelt said   No loyal citizen of the United States should be denied the democratic right to exercise the responsibilities of his citizenship  regardless of his ancestry  The principle on which this country was founded and by which it has always been governed is that Americanism is a matter of the mind and heart  Americanism is not  and never was  a matter of race or ancestry   In 1944  the U S  Supreme Court upheld the legality of the executive order in the Korematsu v  United States case  The executive order remained in force until December when Roosevelt released the Japanese internees  except for those who announced their intention to return to Japan  Italy was an official enemy  and citizens of Italy were also forced away from  strategic  coastal areas in California  Altogether  58 000 Italians were forced to relocate  They relocated on their own and were not put in camps  Known spokesmen for Benito Mussolini were arrested and held in prison  The restrictions were dropped in October 1942  and Italy switched sides in 1943 and became an American ally  In the east  however  the large Italian populations of the northeast  especially in munitions producing centers such as Bridgeport and New Haven faced no restrictions and contributed just as much to the war effort as other Americans   edit  Wartime politics Roosevelt easily won the bitterly contested 1940 election  but the Conservative coalition maintained a tight grip on Congress  Wendell Willkie  the defeated GOP candidate in 1940  became a roving ambassador for Roosevelt  After a series of squabbles with Vice President Henry A  Wallace  Roosevelt stripped him of his administrative responsibilities and dropped him from the 1944 ticket  choosing instead Senator Harry S  Truman  Truman was best known for investigating waste  fraud and inefficiency in civilian programs  45  In very light turnout in 1942 the Republicans made major gains  In the 1944 election  Roosevelt defeated Tom Dewey in a relatively close race that attracted little attention   edit  Propaganda and culture Rural school children in front of homefront posters  San Augustine County  Texas  1943  Main article  American propaganda during World War II The media cooperated with the federal government in presenting the official view of the war  All movie scripts had to be pre approved  46  For example there was widespread rumors in the Army to the effect that people on the homefront were slacking off  A Private SNAFU film cartoon  released to soldiers only  belied that rumor  47  World War II posters helped to mobilize the nation  Inexpensive  accessible  and ever present  the poster was an ideal agent for making war aims the personal mission of every citizen  Government agencies  businesses  and private organizations issued an array of poster images linking the military front with the home front calling upon every American to boost production at work and at home  Deriving their appearance from the fine and commercial arts  posters conveyed more than simple slogans  Posters expressed the needs and goals of the people who created them  By definition  wartime posters are naturally propagandistic  but most posters were merely patriotically so  Some  however  resorted to extreme racial and ethnic caricatures of the enemy  sometimes as hopelessly bumbling cartoon characters  sometimes as evil  half human creatures  The National Archives  Northwestern University and the University of Minnesota all have extensive collections of World War II posters accessible online that contain many examples of posters of the era in regard to the use of propaganda  both subtle and patriotic  and blatantly anti German and Japanese  One of the most noteworthy areas of civilian involvement during the war was in the area of recycling  Many everyday commodities were vital to the war effort  and drives were organized to recycle such things as rubber  tin  waste kitchen fats  the predominant raw material of explosives and many pharmaceuticals  paper  lumber  steel and many others  Popular phrases promoted by the government at the time were  Get into the scrap   and  Get some cash for your trash   a nominal sum was paid to the donor for many kinds of scrap items  and Thomas  Fats  Waller even wrote and recorded a song with the latter title  Such commodities as rubber and tin remained highly important as recycled materials until the end of the war  while others  such as steel  were critically needed at first  but in lesser quantities as damaged war supplies were returned from overseas for scrapping  lessening the need for civilian scrap metal drives  Once again  war propaganda played a prominent role in many of these drives  A strong aspect of American culture then as now was a fascination with celebrities  and many stars of Hollywood and radio gave service above and beyond the call in the donation of their time for everything from being Civilian Defense marshals to making personal appearances at War Bond drives  The sale of bonds produced the money that financed the war  and Bond drives where celebrities appeared were always very successful  The public paid 3 4 of the face value of a war bond  and received the full face value back after a set number of years  While this may have represented a rather unspectacular interest rate  the government has never defaulted on payment of any bond  People were challenged to put  at least 10  of every paycheck into Bonds   citation needed  Compliance was high  with entire factories of workers earning a special  Minuteman  flag to fly over their plant if all workers belonged to the  Ten Percent Club   There were seven major War Loan drives  all of which exceeded their goals  An added advantage was that citizens who were putting their money into War Bonds were not putting it into the home front wartime economy  There was a job for anyone who wanted one during the war  most of them well paid  Personal income was at an all time high  and more dollars were chasing fewer goods to purchase  This was a recipe for runaway inflation that was largely avoided because Americans cajoled daily by their government to do so were also saving money at an all time high rate  mostly in War Bonds but also in private savings accounts and insurance policies  citation needed  Hollywood studios also went all out for the war effort  as studios allowed their major stars  such as Clark Gable and James Stewart  to enlist  and also created propaganda films to remind American moviegoers of their heritage  Many of the finest films of the era are about the war  such as Casablanca  Mrs  Miniver  and Going My Way  while others  such as Yankee Doodle Dandy  focused on patriotism  Even before active American involvement in the war  the popular Three Stooges comic trio were lampooning the Nazi German leadership  and Nazis in general  with a number of short subject films  starting with You Nazty Spy  in January 1940  nearly two years before the United States was drawn into World War II  the very first Hollywood produced work to ridicule Hitler and the Nazis  Cartoons and short subjects were a major sign of the times  as Warner Brothers Studios and Disney Studios gave unprecedented aid to the war effort by creating cartoons that were both patriotic and humorous  and also contributed to remind movie goers of wartime activities such as rationing and scrap drives  war bond purchases  and the creation of victory gardens  Warner shorts such as Daffy   The Commando  Draftee Daffy  Herr Meets Hare and Russian Rhapsody are particularly remembered for their biting wit and unflinching mockery of the enemy  particularly Adolf Hitler  Hideki T j  and Hermann Goering  Their cartoons of Private Snafu  produced for the military as  training films   served to remind many military men of the importance of following proper procedure during wartime  for their own safety  Hanna Barbara also contributed to the war effort with slyly pro US short cartoon The Yankee Doodle Mouse with  Lt  Jerry Mouse as the hero and Tom Cat as the  enemy   Walt Disney s studio also helped the war effort  as almost every cartoon produced by Disney in this period dealt with the war effort  Each Disney cartoon began with a headshot of Mickey Mouse  Donald Duck  or Goofy  and during this time each wore an Army or Navy cap  Disney produced a B Feature based on the book  Victory Through Air Power and several promotional and comical shorts on the importance of rationing  buying bonds and paying one s income tax   Taxes Against the Axis    Education for Death was a Disney short documentary based on the book of the same name  on the making of a Nazi  demonstrating the cruelty of Hitler s Reich against even its own citizens  weeding out the  weak or inferior  and breeding hatred and obedience in its people  devoid of compassion  Der Fuehrer s Face aka Donald Duck in Nutziland  starring Donald living a nightmare in German province and working in a munitions plant  was one of the most popular and famous cartoons of the period  The song from the cartoon    Der Fuehrer s face  recorded by Spike Jones  amp  the City Slickers   also became very popular for its contempt of Nazi leaders  Ven der Fuehrer says   Ve iss der master race   Ve HEIL   honk   HEIL   honk   Right in der Fuehrer s face  Not to luff der Fuehrer iss a great disgrace  So Ve HEIL   honk   HEIL   honk   Right in der Fuehrer s face  Ven Herr Goebbels says   Ve own der world und space   Ve HEIL   honk   HEIL   honk   Right in Herr Goebbels  face  Ven Herr Goering says   Dey ll never bomb dis place   Ve HEIL   honk   HEIL   honk   Right in Herr Goering s face  Disney s famous Three Little Pigs song  Who s Afraid of the Big  Bad Wolf  became a rallying cry for civilians during the war  In a short during the war years  the familiar pigs and wolf were re imagined with the  bricks  in the Practical Pig s house being actually made of war bonds  and the Big Bad Wolf is shown wearing a swastika  representing Nazi Germany  Disney Cartoon Mascots during the War  The American Volunteer Group s  Flying Tiger  insignia  shown on a Curtiss P 40 fighter of that unit  piloted by ace Robert  R T   Smith  was created by the Walt Disney Company  Donald Duck mascot of United States Coast Guard Auxiliary  309th Fighter Squadron  415th Fighter Squadron  438th Fighter Squadron  479th Bombardment Squadron  531st Bombardment Squadron  Goofy mascot of 602nd Bomb Squadron  756th Bomb Squadron  Pete  Disney character  mascot of United States Merchant Marine  603rd Bomb Squadron Figaro  Disney  mascot of RAF Ace Ian Gleed s Spitfire Mk  Vb Troop while he was in action over the Western Desert and the Mediterranean during the middle of the war  The Disney company also created a number of military unit insignias for the United States forces during World War II  including the American Volunteer Group  the  Flying Tigers  of the China Burma India Theater s early years in the war  48  The Looney Tunes characters of the time  from the Warner Brothers animation studio  also were used by a number of American military units  and individual fighting vehicles  mostly tanks  jeeps and warplanes   such as  Bugs Bunny mascot of Kingman Army Air Field  Kingman  Arizona  486th Bomb squadron  530th Bombardment Squadron Daffy Duck mascot of 600th Bomb Squadron Sylvester  Looney Tunes  mascot of 45th Reconnaissance Squadron citation needed  Yosemite Sam mascot of US Army air Corps 20th Reconnaissance Squadron citation needed  later the 20th Intelligence Squadron   edit  See also American Minority Groups in World War II American music during World War II Greatest Generation Home front during World War II Military history of
