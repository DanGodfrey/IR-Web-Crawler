United States Bill of Rights From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search United States Bill of Rights United States Bill of Rights Created September 25  1789 Ratified December 15  1791 Location National Archives Author s  James Madison Purpose To set limits on government actions in regard to personal liberties  The Bill of Rights is the collective name for the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution  These limitations serve to protect the natural rights of liberty and property  They guarantee a number of personal freedoms  limit the government s power in judicial and other proceedings  and reserve some powers to the states and the public  While originally the amendments applied only to the federal government  most of their provisions have since been held to apply to the states by way of the Fourteenth Amendment  The amendments were introduced by James Madison to the 1st United States Congress as a series of legislative articles  They were adopted by the House of Representatives on August 21  1789  1  2  formally proposed by joint resolution of Congress on September 25  1789  and came into effect as Constitutional Amendments on December 15  1791  through the process of ratification by three fourths of the States  While twelve amendments were passed by Congress  only ten were originally passed by the states  Of the remaining two  one was adopted as the Twenty seventh Amendment and the other technically remains pending before the states  Originally  the Bill of Rights legally protected only land owning white men  3  excluding African Americans 4  and women  5  6   However  these limitations were not explicit in the Bill of Right s text  It took additional Constitutional Amendments and numerous Supreme Court cases to extend the same rights to all U S  citizens  The Bill of Rights plays a key role in American law and government  and remains a vital symbol of the freedoms and culture of the nation  One of the first

drafting the American Bill of Rights was the English Bill of Rights of 1689  one of the fundamental documents of English constitutional law  The English Bill of Rights differed substantially in form and intent from the American Bill of Rights  because it was intended to address the rights of citizens as represented by Parliament against the Crown  However  some of its basic tenets were adopted and extended by the U S  Bill of Rights  including  the right of petition  an independent judiciary  the Sovereign was forbidden to establish his own courts or to act as a judge himself   freedom from taxation by royal  executive  prerogative  without agreement by Parliament  legislators   freedom from a peace time standing army  freedom  for Protestants  to bear arms for their defence  as allowed by law  freedom to elect members of Parliament without interference from the Sovereign  freedom of speech in Parliament  freedom from cruel and unusual punishments and excessive bail  and freedom from fines and forfeitures without trial  Virginia Declaration of Rights Main article  Virginia Declaration of Rights The Virginia Declaration of Rights  well known to Madison  had already been a strong influence on the American Revolution   all power is vested in  and consequently derived from  the people       7  also  a majority of the community hath an indubitable  unalienable  and indefeasible right to reform  alter or abolish  the government     It had shaped the drafting of the United States Declaration of Independence a decade before the drafting of the Constitution  proclaiming that  all men are by nature equally free and independent  and have certain inherent rights of which      they cannot divest   namely  the enjoyment of life and liberty  with the means of acquiring and possessing property  and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety   8  On a practical level  its recommendations of a government with a separation of powers  Articles 5 6  and  frequent  certain  and regular  9 elections of executives and legislators were incorporated into the United States Constitution   but the bulk of this work addresses the rights of the people and restrictions on the powers of government  and is recognizable in the modern Bill of Rights  The government should not have the power of suspending or executing laws   without consent of the representatives of the people    10  A legal defendant has the right to be  confronted with the accusers and witnesses  to call for evidence in his favor  and to a speedy trial by an impartial jury of his vicinage   and may not be  compelled to give evidence against himself   11  Individuals should be protected against  cruel and unusual punishments   12  baseless search and seizure  13  and be guaranteed a trial by jury  14  The government should not abridge freedom of the press  15  or freedom of religion   all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion    16  The government should be enjoined against maintaining a standing army rather than a  well regulated militia   17  Articles of Confederation Prior to the acceptance and implementation of the United States Constitution  the original 13 colonies followed the stipulations and agreements set forth in the Articles of Confederation  created by the Second Continental Congress and ratified in 1781  The national government that operated under the Articles of Confederation was too weak however to adequately regulate the various conflicts that arose between the states  18  The Philadelphia Convention set out to correct weaknesses inherent in the Articles of Confederation that had been apparent even before the American Revolutionary War had been successfully concluded  18  The newly constituted Federal government included a strong executive branch  a stronger legislative branch and an independent judiciary  The Bill of Rights is a series of limitations on the power of the U S  federal government  protecting the natural rights of liberty and property including freedom of religion  freedom of speech  a free press  free assembly  and free association  as well as the right to keep and bear arms  In federal criminal cases  it requires indictment by a grand jury for any capital or  infamous crime   guarantees a speedy  public trial with an impartial jury composed of members of the state or judicial district in which the crime occurred  and prohibits double jeopardy  In addition  the Bill of Rights reserves for the people any rights not specifically mentioned in the Constitution 19  and reserves all powers not specifically granted to the federal government to the people or the States  Most of these restrictions on the federal government were later applied to the states by a series of legal decisions applying the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment  which was ratified in 1868  The Bill was influenced by George Mason s 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights  the English Bill of Rights 1689  works of the Age of Enlightenment pertaining to natural rights  and earlier English political documents such as Magna Carta  1215   The Anti Federalists See also  Anti Federalism and Anti Federalist Papers On June 5  1788  Patrick Henry spoke before Virginia s ratification convention in opposition to the Constitution  Following the Philadelphia Convention  some famous revolutionary figures and statesmen  such as Patrick Henry  publicly argued against the Constitution  20  Many were concerned that the strong national government proposed by the Federalists was a threat to individual rights and that the President would become a king  and objected to the federal court system in the proposed Constitution  Thomas Jefferson  at the time serving as Ambassador to France  wrote to Madison advocating a Bill of Rights   Half a loaf is better than no bread  If we cannot secure all our rights  let us secure what we can   21 George Mason refused to sign the proposed Constitution  in part to protest its lack of a Bill of Rights  22  In a paper later collected into the Anti Federalist Papers  the pseudonymous  Brutus   probably Robert Yates  wrote  We find they have  in the ninth section of the first article declared  that the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended  unless in cases of rebellion   that no bill of attainder  or ex post facto law  shall be passed   that no title of nobility shall be granted by the United States  etc  If every thing which is not given is reserved  what propriety is there in these exceptions  Does this Constitution any where grant the power of suspending the habeas corpus  to make ex post facto laws  pass bills of attainder  or grant titles of nobility  It certainly does not in express terms  The only answer that can be given is  that these are implied in the general powers granted  With equal truth it may be said  that all the powers which the bills of rights guard against the abuse of  are contained or implied in the general ones granted by this Constitution  23  Brutus continued with an implication directed against the Founding Fathers  Ought not a government  vested with such extensive and indefinite authority  to have been restricted by a declaration of rights  It certainly ought  So clear a point is this  that I cannot help suspecting that persons who attempt to persuade people that such reservations were less necessary under this Constitution than under those of the States  are wilfully endeavoring to deceive  and to lead you into an absolute state of vassalage  23  Philadelphia Convention The United States Constitutional Convention 24   also known as the Philadelphia Convention  24  and various other names  took place from May 14 to September 17  1787  in Philadelphia  Pennsylvania and although the Convention was purportedly intended only to revise the Articles of Confederation  the intention from the outset of many of its proponents  chief among them James Madison and Alexander Hamilton  was to create a new government rather than fix the existing one  Due to the difficulty of travel in the late 18th century  very few of the selected delegates were present on the designated day of May 14  1787  and it was not until May 25 that a quorum of seven states was secured  The convention convened in the Pennsylvania State House  and George Washington was unanimously elected as president of the convention 25  and William Jackson was elected as secretary  Madison s Notes of Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787 remain the most complete record of the convention  18  In late July 1787  the convention appointed a Committee of Detail to draft a document based on the agreements that had been reached  After another month of discussion and refinement  a second committee  the Committee of Style and Arrangement  headed by Gouverneur Morris  and including Hamilton  William Samuel Johnson  Rufus King  and Madison  produced the final version  which was submitted for signing on September 17  Morris is credited  both now and then  as the chief draftsman of the final document  including the preamble  Not all delegates were pleased with the results and thirteen of them left before the ceremony  three of those remaining refused to sign  Edmund Randolph of Virginia  George Mason of Virginia  and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts  George Mason demanded a Bill of Rights if he was to support the Constitution  The Bill of Rights was not included in the Constitution submitted to the states for ratification  but many states ratified it anyway with the understanding that a bill of rights would soon follow  26  39 of the 55 delegates ended up signing  but it is likely that none were completely satisfied  Their views were summed up by Benjamin Franklin  who said   There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve  but I am not sure I shall never approve them      I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain  may be able to make a better Constitution      It therefore astonishes me  Sir  to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does  and I think it will astonish our enemies     Delegates to the Philadelphia Convention on September 12  1787  debated whether to include a Bill of Rights in the body of the U S  Constitution  and an agreement to create the Bill of Rights helped to secure ratification of the Constitution itself  27  Ideological conflict between Federalists and anti Federalists threatened the final ratification of the new national Constitution  Thus  the Bill addressed the concerns of some of the Constitution s influential opponents  including prominent Founding Fathers  who argued that the Constitution should not be ratified because it failed to protect the fundamental principles of human liberty  The Constitution was then submitted to the states for ratification  pursuant to its own Article VII  Twelve articles were proposed to the States  but only ten  corresponding to the First through Tenth Amendments  were ratified in the 18th Century  The first Article  dealing with the number and apportionment of U S  Representatives  has never been ratified  and the second  limiting the power of Congress to increase the salaries of its members  was ratified in 1992 as the 27th Amendment  Delegates to the Constitutional convention The 55 delegates who drafted the Constitution included many of the Founding Fathers of the new nation  Thomas Jefferson  who was Minister to France during the convention  characterized the delegates as an assembly of  demi gods   18 John Adams also did not attend  being abroad in Europe as Minister to Great Britain  but he wrote home to encourage the delegates  Patrick Henry was also absent  he refused to go because he  smelt a rat in Philadelphia  tending toward the monarchy   Also absent were John Hancock and Samuel Adams  Rhode Island refused to send delegates to the convention  Connecticut Oliver Ellsworth  William Samuel Johnson Roger Sherman Delaware Richard Bassett Gunning Bedford  Jr  Jacob Broom John Dickinson George Read Georgia Abraham Baldwin William Few William Houstoun  William Pierce  Maryland Daniel

Washington George Wythe  Rhode Island Rhode Island did not send delegates to the convention      Did not sign the final draft of the U S  Constitution  Randolph  Mason  and Gerry were the only three present in Philadelphia at the time who refused to sign  The Bill of Rights The Ideas of John Locke Madison s  Notes for speech on Constitutional amendments  June 8  1789  in which he underlined the concept of  natural rights retained  To some degree  the Bill of Rights  and the American Revolution  incorporated the ideas of John Locke  who argued in his 1689 work Two Treatises of Government that civil society was created for the protection of property  Latin proprius  or that which is one s own  meaning  life  liberty  and estate    Locke also advanced the notion that each individual is free and equal in the state of nature  Locke expounded on the idea of natural rights that are inherent to all individuals  a concept Madison mentioned in his speech presenting the Bill of Rights to the 1st Congress  Locke s argument for protecting economic rights against government may have been most salient to the framers of the Amendments  quartering and cruel punishments were not the current abuses of 1791  28  Madison s preemptive proposal On June 8  1789  Madison submitted his proposal to Congress  In his speech to Congress on that day  Madison said  For while we feel all these inducements to go into a revisal of the constitution  we must feel for the constitution itself  and make that revisal a moderate one  I should be unwilling to see a door opened for a re consideration of the whole structure of the government  for a re consideration of the principles and the substance of the powers given  because I doubt  if such a door was opened  if we should be very likely to stop at that point which would be safe to the government itself  But I do wish to see a door opened to consider  so far as to incorporate those provisions for the security of rights  against which I believe no serious objection has been made by any class of our constituents  29  Prior to listing his proposals for a number of constitutional amendments  Madison acknowledged a major reason for some of the discontent with the Constitution as written  I believe that the great mass of the people who opposed  the Constitution   disliked it because it did not contain effectual provision against encroachments on particular rights  and those safeguards which they have been long accustomed to have interposed between them and the magistrate who exercised the sovereign power  nor ought we to consider them safe  while a great number of our fellow citizens think these securities necessary  29  Madison s proposed amendments were presented as Nine Articles comprisinng up to 20 Amendemnts  The amendments which have occurred to me  proper to be recommended by congress to the state legislatures are these  First  That there be prefixed to the constitution a declaration That all power is originally vested in  and consequently derived from the people  That government is instituted  and ought to be exercised for the benefit of the people  which consists in the enjoyment of life and liberty  with the right of acquiring and using property  and generally of pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety  That the people have an indubitable  unalienable  and indefeasible right to reform or change their government  whenever it be found adverse or inadequate to the purposes of its institution  Secondly  That in article 2nd  section 2  clause 3  these words be struck out  to wit   The number of representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand  but each state shall have at least one representative  and until such enumeration shall be made   And that in place thereof be inserted these words  to wit   After the first actual enumeration  there shall be one representative for every thirty thousand  until the number amount to after which the proportion shall be so regulated by congress  that the number shall never be less than nor more than but each state shall after the first enumeration  have at least two representatives  and prior thereto   Thirdly  That in article 2nd  section 6  clause 1  there be added to the end of the first sentence  these words  to wit   But no law varying the compensation last ascertained shall operate before the next ensuing election of representatives   Fourthly  That in article 2nd  section 9  between clauses 3 and 4  be inserted these clauses  to wit The civil rights of none shall be abridged on account of religious belief or worship  nor shall any national religion be established  nor shall the full and equal rights of conscience by in any manner  or on any pretext infringed The people shall not be deprived or abridged of their right to speak  to write  or to publish their sentiments  and the freedom of the press  as one of the great bulwarks of liberty  shall be inviolable  The people shall not be restrained from peaceably assembling and consulting for their common good  nor from applying to the legislature by petitions  or remonstrances for redress of their grievances  The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed  a well armed  and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country  but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms  shall be compelled to render military service in person  No soldier shall in time of peace be quartered in any house without the consent of the owner  nor at any time  but in a manner warranted by law  No person shall be subject  except in cases of impeachment  to more than one punishment  or one trial for the same office  nor shall be compelled to be a witness against himself  nor be deprived of life  liberty  or property without due process of law  nor be obliged to relinquish his property  where it may be necessary for public use  without a just compensation  Excessive bail shall not be required  nor excessive fines imposed  nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted  The rights of the people to be secured in their persons  their houses  their papers  and their other property from all unreasonable searches and seizures  shall not be violated by warrants issued without probable cause  supported by oath or affirmation  or not particularly describing the places to be searched  or the persons or things to be seized  In all criminal prosecutions  the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial  to be informed of the cause and nature of the accusation  to be confronted with his accusers  and the witnesses against him  to have a compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor  and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense  The exceptions here or elsewhere in the constitution  made in favor of particular rights  shall not be so construed as to diminish the just importance of other rights retained by the people  or as to enlarge the powers delegated by the constitution  but either as actual limitations of such powers  or as inserted merely for greater caution  Fifthly  That in article 2nd  section 10  between clauses 1 and 2  be inserted this clause  to wit  No state shall violate the equal rights of conscience  or the freedom of the press  or the trial by jury in criminal cases  Sixthly  That article 3rd  section 2  be annexed to the end of clause 2nd  these words to wit  but no appeal to such court shall be allowed where the value in controversy shall not amount to    dollars  nor shall any fact triable by jury  according to the course of common law  be otherwise re examinable than may consist with the principles of common law  Seventhly  That in article 3rd  section 2  the third clause be struck out  and in its place be inserted the classes following  to wit  The trial of all crimes  except in cases of impeachments  and cases arising in the land or naval forces  or the militia when on actual service in time of war or public danger  shall be by an impartial jury of freeholders of the vicinage  with the requisite of unanimity for conviction  of the right of challenge  and other accustomed requisites  and in all crimes punishable with loss of life or member  presentment or indictment by a grand jury shall be an essential preliminary  provided that in cases of crimes committed within any county which may be in possession of an enemy  or in which a general insurrection may prevail  the trial may by law be authorized in some other county of the same state  as near as may be to the seat of the offence  In cases of crimes committed not within any county  the trial may by law be in such county as the laws shall have prescribed  In suits at common law  between man and man  the trial by jury  as one of the best securities to the rights of the people  ought to remain inviolate  Eighthly  That immediately after article 6th  be inserted  as article 7th  the clauses following  to wit  The powers delegated by this constitution  are appropriated to the departments to which they are respectively distributed  so that the legislative department shall never exercise the powers vested in the executive or judicial  nor the executive exercise the powers vested in the legislative or judicial  nor the judicial exercise the powers vested in the legislative or executive departments  The powers not delegated by this constitution  nor prohibited by it to the states  are reserved to the States respectively  Ninthly  That article 7th  be numbered as article 8th  Madison s proposal was reworked and adopted as 17 Amendments by the House of Representatives on August 21  1789  and forwarded to the Senate on August 24  The House version rejected Madison s idea to incorporate the amendments into the body of the Constitution and instead submitted it s 17 Articles to be attached separately  in addition to  and amendment of  the Constitution    30  The Senate edited the House s proposed 17 Amendments and adopted a version with 12 Amendments  The two versions went to the Joint Committee and the Senate s version became the one adopted by joint resolution of Congress on September 25  1789  to be forwarded to the states on September 28  1  2  31  Early sentiments favoring expanding the Bill of Rights A portrait of Alexander Hamilton shortly after the American Revolution The idea of adding a bill of rights to the Constitution was originally controversial  Alexander Hamilton  in Federalist No  84  argued against a  Bill of Rights   asserting that ratification of the Constitution did not mean the American people were surrendering their rights  and  therefore  that protections were unnecessary   Here  in strictness  the people surrender nothing  and as they retain everything  they have no need of particular reservations   Critics pointed out that earlier political documents had protected specific rights  but Hamilton argued that the Constitution was inherently different  Bills of rights are in their origin  stipulations between kings and their subjects  abridgments of prerogative in favor of privilege  reservations of rights not surrendered to the prince  Such was  Magna Charta   obtained by the Barons  swords in hand  from King John  32  Finally  Hamilton expressed the fear that protecting specific rights might imply that any unmentioned rights would not be protected  I go further  and affirm that bills of rights  in the sense and in the extent in which they are contended for  are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution  but would even be dangerous  They would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted  and on this very account  would afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were granted  For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do  32  Essentially  Hamilton and other Federalists believed in the British system of common law which did not define or quantify natural rights  They believed that adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution would limit their rights to those listed in the Constitution  This is the primary reason the Ninth Amendment was included  Thomas Jefferson was a supporter of the Bill of Rights  33 George Mason  wished the plan  the Constitution  had been prefaced with a Bill of Rights   Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts  concurred in the idea  amp  moved for a Committee to prepare a Bill of Rights   Roger Sherman argued against a Bill of Rights stating that the  State Declarations of Rights are not repealed by this Constitution   Mason then stated  The Laws of the U  S  are to be paramount to State Bills of Rights   Gerry s motion was defeated with 10 Nays  1 Absent  and No Yeas  34  Ratification and the Massachusetts Compromise

least the desirability  of a bill of rights was almost universally felt  and the Anti Federalists were able to play on these feelings in the ratification convention in Massachusetts  By this stage  five of the states had ratified the Constitution with relative ease  however  the Massachusetts convention was bitter and contentious  In Massachusetts  the Constitution ran into serious  organized opposition  Only after two leading Anti federalists  Adams and Hancock  negotiated a far reaching compromise did the convention vote for ratification on February 6  1788  187 168   Anti federalists had demanded that the Constitution be amended before they would consider it or that amendments be a condition of ratification  Federalists had retorted that it had to be accepted or rejected as it was  Under the Massachusetts compromise  the delegates recommended amendments to be considered by the new Congress  should the Constitution go into force  The Massachusetts compromise determined the fate of the Constitution  as it permitted delegates with doubts to vote for it in the hope that it would be amended  35  On September 17  1787  the Constitution was completed  followed by a speech given by Benjamin Franklin  who urged unanimity  although the Convention decided that only nine states were needed to ratify  The Convention submitted the Constitution to the Congress of the Confederation 36  Massachusetts  Rufus King assessed the Convention as a creature of the states  independent of the Articles Congress  submitting its proposal to Congress only to satisfy forms  Though amendments were debated  they were all defeated  and on September 28  1787  the Articles Congress resolved  unanimously  to transmit the Constitution to state legislatures for submitting to a ratification convention according to the Constitutional procedure  37  Several states enlarged the numbers qualified just for electing ratification delegates  In this they went beyond the Constitution s provision for the most voters for the state legislature to make a new social contract among  more nearly than ever before   We  the people   38  Following Massachusetts  lead  the Federalist minorities in both Virginia and New York were able to obtain ratification in convention by linking ratification to recommended amendments  39  A minority of the Constitution s critics continued to oppose the Constitution  Maryland s Luther Martin argued that the federal convention had exceeded its authority  he still called for amending the Articles  40  Article 13 of the Articles of Confederation stated that the union created under the Articles was  perpetual  and that any alteration must be  agreed to in a Congress of the United States  and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State   41  However  the unanimous requirement under the Articles made all attempts at reform impossible  Martin s allies such as New York s John Lansing  Jr   dropped moves to obstruct the Convention s process  They began to take exception to the Constitution  as it was   seeking amendments  Several conventions saw supporters for  amendments before  shift to a position of  amendments after  for the sake of staying in the Union  New York Anti s  circular letter  was sent to each state legislature proposing a second constitutional convention for  amendments before   It failed in the state legislatures  Ultimately  only North Carolina and Rhode Island would wait for amendments from Congress before ratifying  39  Article VII of the proposed constitution stipulated that only nine of the thirteen states would have to ratify for the new government to go into effect  for the participating states   After a year had passed in state by state ratification battles  on September 13  1788  the Articles Congress certified that the new Constitution had been ratified  The new government would be inaugurated with eleven of the thirteen  The Articles Congress directed the new government to begin in New York City on the first Wednesday in March  42  and on March 4  1789  the government duly began operations  George Washington had earlier been reluctant to go the Convention for fear the states  with their darling sovereignties  could not be overcome  43  But he was elected the Constitution s President unanimously  including the vote of Virginia s presidential elector  the Anti federalist Patrick Henry  44  The new Congress would be a triumph for the Federalists  The Senate of eleven states would be 20 Federalists to two Virginia  Henry  Anti federalists  The House would seat 48 Federalists to 11 Antis from only four states  Massachusetts  New York  Virginia and South Carolina  45  Antis  fears of personal oppression by Congress would be allayed by Amendments passed under the floor leadership of James Madison in the first session of the first Congress  These first ten Amendments ratified by the states were to become known as the Bill of Rights  46  Objections to a potentially remote federal judiciary would be reconciled with 13 federal courts  11 states  Maine and Kentucky   and three Federal riding circuits out of the Supreme Court  Eastern  Middle and South  47  Suspicion of a powerful federal executive was answered by Washington s cabinet appointments of once Anti Federalists Edmund Jennings Randolph as Attorney General and Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State  48  49  What Constitutional historian Pauline Maier calls a national  dialogue between power and liberty  had begun anew  50  George Washington s 1788 letter to the Marquis de Lafayette observed   the Convention of Massachusetts adopted the Constitution in toto  but recommended a number of specific alterations and quieting explanations   Source  Library of Congress Four of the next five states to ratify  including New Hampshire  Virginia  and New York  included similar language in their ratification instruments  They all sent recommendations for amendments with their ratification documents to the new Congress  Since many of these recommendations pertained to safeguarding personal rights  this pressured Congress to add a Bill of Rights after Constitutional ratification  Additionally  North Carolina refused to ratify the Constitution until progress was made on the issue of the Bill of Rights  Thus  while the Anti Federalists were unsuccessful in their quest to prevent the adoption of the Constitution  their efforts were not totally in vain  After the Constitution was ratified in 1789  the 1st United States Congress met in Federal Hall in New York City  Most of the delegates agreed that a  bill of rights  was needed and most of them agreed on the rights they believed should be enumerated  James Madison   Father of the Constitution  and first author of the Bill of Rights Madison  at the head of the Virginia delegation of the 1st Congress  had originally opposed a Bill of Rights but hoped to pre empt a second Constitutional Convention that might have undone the difficult compromises of 1787  a second convention would open the entire Constitution to reconsideration and could undermine the work he and so many others had done in establishing the structure of the U S  Government  Writing to Jefferson  he stated   The friends of the Constitution   wish the revisal to be carried no farther than to supply additional guards for liberty   and are fixed in opposition to the risk of another Convention    It is equally certain that there are others who urge a second Convention with the insidious hope of throwing all things into Confusion  and of subverting the fabric just established  if not the Union itself   51  Madison based much of the Bill of Rights on George Mason s Virginia Declaration of Rights  1776   52  which itself had been written with Madison s input  He carefully considered the state amendment recommendations as well  He looked for recommendations shared by many states to avoid controversy and reduce opposition to the ratification of the future amendments  53  Additionally  Madison s work on the Bill of Rights reflected centuries of English law and philosophy  further modified by the principles of

become part of the Constitution  Article II was ratified by 6 14  later 7 15 states  but did not receive the 3 4 majority of States needed for ratification until 1992 when it became the 27th Amendment  Later consideration Lawmakers in Kentucky  which became the 15th state to join the Union in June 1792  ratified the entire set of twelve proposals during that commonwealth s initial month of statehood  perhaps unaware   given the nature of long distance communications in the 1700s   that Virginia s approval six months earlier had already made ten of the package of twelve part of the Constitution  Although ratification made the Bill of Rights effective in 1791  three of the original thirteen states   Connecticut  Georgia  and Massachusetts   did not ratify the first ten amendments until 1939  when they were urged to do so in a celebration of the 150th anniversary of their passage by Congress  55  Text of the Bill of Rights Preamble Congress of the United States begun and held at the City of New York  on Wednesday the fourth of March  one thousand seven hundred and eighty nine THE Conventions of a number of the States  having at the time of their adopting the Constitution

compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives  shall take effect  until an election of Representatives shall have intervened  The Bill of Rights United States Bill of Rights currently housed in the National Archives  It is commonly understood that originally the Bill of Rights was not intended to apply to the states  however  there is no such limit in the text itself  except where an amendment refers specifically to the federal government  One example is the First Amendment  which says only that  Congress shall make no law      and under which some states in the early years of the nation officially established a religion  A rule of inapplicability to the states remained until 1868  when the Fourteenth Amendment was passed  which stated  in part  that  No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States  nor shall any State deprive any person of life  liberty  or property  without due process of law  nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws  The Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to extend most  but not all  parts of the Bill of Rights to the states  a process known as incorporation of the Bill of Rights  The balance of state and federal power under the incorporation doctrine is still an open question and continues to be fought separately for each right in the federal courts  The amendments that became the Bill of Rights were the last ten of the twelve amendments proposed in 1789  The second of the twelve proposed amendments  regarding the compensation of members of Congress  remained unratified until 1992  when the legislatures of enough states finally approved it  as a result  after pending for two centuries  it became the Twenty seventh Amendment  The first of the twelve  which is still technically pending before the state legislatures for ratification  pertains to the apportionment of the United States House of Representatives after each decennial census  The most recent state whose lawmakers are known to have ratified this proposal is Kentucky in 1792  during that commonwealth s first month of statehood  First Amendment  addresses the rights of freedom of religion  prohibiting Congress from making a law  respecting an establishment  of religion and protecting the right to free exercise of religion   freedom of speech  freedom of the press  freedom of assembly  and freedom of petition  Second Amendment  guarantees the right of individuals to possess weapons  The most recent Supreme Court decision interpreting the Second Amendment is McDonald v  Chicago  Third Amendment  prohibits the government from using private homes as quarters for soldiers during peacetime without the consent of the owners  The only existing case law directly regarding this amendment is a decision of the Court of Appeals  the appellate level between the U S  District Court and the U S  Supreme Court  in the case of Engblom v  Carey  58  However  it is also cited in the landmark case  Griswold v  Connecticut  in support of the Supreme Court s holding that the constitution protects the right to personal privacy  Fourth Amendment  guards against searches  arrests  and seizures of property without a specific warrant or a  probable cause  to believe a crime has been committed  Some rights to privacy have been inferred from this amendment and others by the Supreme Court  Fifth Amendment  forbids trial for a major crime except after indictment by a grand jury  prohibits double jeopardy  repeated trials   except in certain very limited circumstances  forbids punishment without due process of law  and provides that an accused person may not be compelled to testify against himself  this is also known as  Taking the Fifth  or  Pleading the Fifth    This is regarded as the  rights of the accused  amendment  otherwise known as the Miranda rights after the Supreme Court case  It also prohibits government from taking private property for public use without  just compensation   the basis of eminent domain in the United States  Sixth Amendment  guarantees a speedy public trial for criminal offenses  It requires trial by a jury  guarantees the right to legal counsel for the accused  and guarantees that the accused may require witnesses to attend the trial and testify in the presence of the accused  It also guarantees the accused a right to know the charges against him  The Sixth Amendment has several court cases associated with it  including Powell v  Alabama  United States v  Wong Kim Ark  Gideon v  Wainwright  and Crawford v  Washington  In 1966  the Supreme Court ruled that the fifth amendment prohibition on forced self incrimination and the sixth amendment clause on right to counsel were to be made known to all persons placed under arrest  and these clauses have become known as the Miranda rights  Seventh Amendment  assures trial by jury in civil cases  Eighth Amendment  forbids excessive bail or fines  and cruel and unusual punishment  Ninth Amendment  declares that the listing of individual rights in the Constitution and Bill of Rights is not meant to be comprehensive  and that the other rights not specifically mentioned are retained by the people  Tenth Amendment  reserves to the states respectively  or to the people  any powers the Constitution did not delegate to the United States  nor prohibit the states from exercising  Status of the original 14 copies George Washington had fourteen handwritten copies of the Bill of Rights made  one for Congress and one for each

fire  65  whereas the Pennsylvania copy reportedly disappeared in the later 18th century  citation needed  Two unidentified copies of the missing four  thought to be the Georgia and Maryland copies  survive  one is in the National Archives 68  69  and the other is in the New York Public Library  66  North Carolina s copy was stolen by a Union soldier in April 1865 and returned to North Carolina in 2005  140 years later by FBI Special Agent Robert King Wittman  59  66  Virginia s copy was used for the Bill of Rights Tour  to mark the bicentennial of the Bill of Rights  in 1991  Excluded from The Bill of Rights Main article  Incorporation of the Bill of Rights Originally  the Bill of Rights restrictions applied only to the federal government and not to the state governments  Parts of the amendments originally proposed by Madison that would have limited state governments   No state shall violate the equal rights of conscience  or the freedom of the press  or the trial by jury in criminal cases    were not approved by Congress  and therefore the Bill of Rights did not apply to the powers of state governments  70  States had established state churches up until the 1820s  and Southern states  beginning in the 1830s  could ban abolitionist literature  In the 1833 case Barron v  Baltimore  the Supreme Court specifically ruled that the Bill of Rights provided  security against the apprehended encroachments of the general government not against those of local governments   In the Gitlow v  New York  268 U S  652   1925  case  the Supreme Court ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment  which had been adopted in 1868  could make certain applications of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states  However  the Gitlow case stated  p  666    For present purposes we may and do presume that freedom of speech and of the press   which are protected by the First Amendment from abridgment by Congress   are among the fundamental personal rights and  liberties  protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from impairment by the States   However at p  668  the Court held   It does not protect publications prompting the overthrow of government by force   which Gitlow and associates advocated in their publications  The Supreme Court has cited Gitlow v  New York as precedent for a series of decisions that made most  but not all  of the provisions of the Bill of Rights restrictions applicable to the states under the doctrine of selective incorporation  The Bill of Rights applied to white men who owned property and excluded most Americans  Free blacks were excluded from The Bill of Rights because they were not citizens  71  Also excluded were all women  Native Americans  immigrants and white men who did not own land  Display and honoring of the Bill of Rights In 1941  President Franklin D  Roosevelt declared December 15 to be Bill of Rights Day  commemorating the 150th anniversary of the ratification of the Bill of Rights  The Bill of Rights is on display at the National Archives and Records Administration  72  in the Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom  The Rotunda itself was constructed in the 1950s and dedicated in 1952 by President Harry S  Truman  who said   Only as these documents are reflected in the thoughts and acts of Americans  can they remain symbols of power that can move the world  That power is our faith in human liberty       73  After fifty years  signs of deterioration in the casing were noted  while the documents themselves appeared to be well preserved   But if the ink of 1787 was holding its own  the encasements of 1951 were not     minute crystals and microdroplets of liquid were found on surfaces of the two glass sheets over each document     The CMS scans confirmed evidence of progressive glass deterioration  which was a major impetus in deciding to re encase the Charters of Freedom   74  Accordingly  the casing was updated and the Rotunda rededicated on September 17  2003  In his dedicatory remarks  two hundred and sixteen years after the close of the Constitutional Convention  President George W  Bush stated   The true  American  revolution was not to defy one earthly power  but to declare principles that stand above every earthly power the equality of each person before God  and the responsibility of government to secure the rights of all   75  In 1991  the Bill
