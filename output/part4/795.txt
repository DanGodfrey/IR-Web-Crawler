Midwestern United States  and its terminus was chosen in 1837  In 1839 homes and a store were built there and by 1842  the settlement   now named Atlanta   had six buildings and 30 residents  By 1854 rail lines had arrived from four different directions  making the young town the rail hub for the entire Southern United States  During the American Civil War  Atlanta was an important railroad and military supply hub  In 1864  the city became the target of a major Union invasion during the Atlanta campaign  In 1864 Atlanta was under union siege for four months  Union General William Tecumseh Sherman ordered all public buildings and Confederate assets destroyed  On September 2  the city surrendered  and on September 7 Sherman ordered evacuation four days before ordering Atlanta to be burned to the ground  The city recovered quickly from the Civil War and grew quickly into a transportation  trade and industrial powerhouse of the Southeast  Henry W  Grady  the editor of the Atlanta Constitution  promoted the city to investors as a city of the  New South   by which he meant a diversification of the economy away from agriculture  and a shift from the  Old South  attitudes of slavery and rebellion  As part of the effort to modernize the South  Grady and many others also supported the creation of the Georgia School of Technology  now the Georgia Institute of Technology   which was founded on the city s northern outskirts in 1885  The city of Atlanta s new symbol  the Phoenix  symbolized this spirit of rebirth  By 1890  the city had a population over 65 000  by 1910  the city had more than 150 000 residents  Skyscrapers began emerging with the 1892 Equitable Building and the 1897 Flatiron Building  The city of Atlanta quickly became a center of Southern business  By 1906  the 17 story Candler Building housed Asa Candler s Coca Cola company  Atlanta s growth was almost unimpeded from 1870 to 1930  with a small interruption during WWI  Despite discrimination and segregation during the early 1900s  a prosperous black middle class and upper class emerged in Atlanta  Desegregation came in stages  buses and trolleys in 1959  19  the first restaurants in 1961  20  theaters in 1962  21  22  and public schools from 1961 73  23  In the 1960s  Atlanta was a major center of the US Civil Rights Movement  with Martin Luther King and students from Atlanta s historically black colleges and universities playing major roles in the movement s leadership  On October 19  1960  a sit in at the lunch counters of several Atlanta department stores led to the arrest of Dr  King and several students  drawing attention from the media and presidential candidate John F  Kennedy  The 1970s saw the election of the first black mayor  Maynard Jackson  most of the MARTA system s construction  and major suburban growth  The 80s saw the launch of CNN and Atlanta hosting the 1988 Democratic National Convention  In the 1990s  Atlanta hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics

to the United States Census Bureau  the city encompasses 132 4 square miles  342 9 km2   of which 131 7 square miles  341 1 km2  is land and 0 7 square miles  1 8 km2  is water  At about 1 050 feet  320 m  above mean sea level  Atlanta sits atop a ridge south of the Chattahoochee River  The Eastern Continental Divide line enters Atlanta from the south  proceeding to the downtown area  From downtown  the divide line runs eastward along DeKalb Avenue and the CSX rail lines through Decatur  24  Rainwater that falls on the south and east side runs eventually into the Atlantic Ocean  while rainwater on the north and west side of the divide runs into the Gulf of Mexico 24  via the Chattahoochee River  That river is part of the ACF River Basin  and from which Atlanta and many of its neighbors draw most of their water  Being at the far northwestern edge of the city  much of the river s natural habitat is still preserved  in part by the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area  Downstream however  excessive water use during droughts and pollution during floods has been a source of contention and legal battles with neighboring states Alabama and Florida  25  26   edit

Atlanta s high mean elevation distinguishes it from most other southern and eastern cities  and contributes to a more temperate climate than is found in areas farther south  27  Humid in the summer  Atlanta often experiences summer thunderstorms  Typical of the southeastern U S   Atlanta receives abundant rainfall  which is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year  though spring and early fall are markedly drier  Average annual rainfall is 50 2 inches  1 280 mm   Temperatures at or above 90  F  32  C  occur more than 40 days per year  overnight freezing can be expected over 45

Cityscape Main articles  Architecture of Atlanta  Neighborhoods of Atlanta  and Metro Atlanta Architecture in Atlanta is dominated by modernism and postmodernism in its commercial and institutional buildings  with a significant influence by hometown architect John Portman  A few notable buildings remain from earlier eras going back to the 1880s  but not a single building remains from the antebellum city  which Union troops burned to the ground in 1864  note 1  Residential architecture in Atlanta s Intown neighborhoods  largely built between the 1880s and 1920s  is characterized by styles ranging from Victorian cottages to Craftsman bungalows to Revival styles  Atlanta s outer neighborhoods were built in post World War II suburban styles  Historically  industry located next to the rail lines  and repurposed industrial structures can be found near those rail lines which both approach Downtown Atlanta from all directions  as well as surround it in a belt pattern  passing through the city s inner neighborhoods    The template below  Wide image  is being considered for merging  See templates for discussion to help reach a consensus    Midtown Atlanta from the Northwest

skyscraper in the foreground  April 2010 Bank of America Plaza  the tallest building in Georgia Most of Atlanta was burned during the Civil War  depleting it its antebellum architecture  Yet Atlanta  architecturally  had never been particularly  southern   Because Atlanta originated as a railroad town  rather than a patrician southern seaport like Savannah or Charleston  many of the city s landmarks could have easily been erected in the Northeast or Midwest  34  After the war  Atlanta viewed itself as the leading city of a progressive  New South   and opted for expressive modern structures  35  Candler Building  1906  As a result of Atlanta s embrace of modernism  its cityscape is dominated by relatively recent architectural styles  containing works by most major U S  firms and some of the more prominent architects of the 20th century  including Michael Graves  Richard Meier  Marcel Breuer  Renzo Piano  Pickard Chilton  and locally based  internationally known Mack Scogin and Merrill Elam Architects  The city s skyline  which began its marked rise in the 1960s  is punctuated with highrise and midrise buildings of both modern and postmodern vintage  At 1 023 feet  312 m   Atlanta s tallest skyscraper the Bank of America Plaza is the 52nd tallest building in the world and the 9th tallest building in the United States  36  Unfortunately  the city s embrace of modernism and postmodernism resulted in an ambivalent approach toward historic preservation  Such an approach ultimately led to the destruction of notable architectural landmarks  including the Equitable Building  Atlanta s first skyscraper   Terminal Station  and the Carnegie Library  Atlanta s cultural icon  the Fox Theatre  would have met the same fate had it not been for a grassroots effort to save it in the mid 1970s  34  Beath Dickey House  1890   example of Queen Anne architecture  Inman Park Atlanta contains more than 40 historic districts  nearly all NRHP listed  The most notable residential historic districts include Druid Hills  with its parks and parkways designed by Frederick Law Olmsted  Inman Park with its Victorian mansions  also Olmsted   Virginia Highland with its Craftsman bungalows  and Cabbagetown with its shotgun houses  One Symphony Tower in Midtown Notable industrial architecture includes Ponce City Market  formerly a Sears regional warehouse   the former Van Winkle Cotton Gin and Machine Works  Northyards  a converted roundhouse and rail yards   and other buildings in the Means Street Historic District  the proposed King Plow Railroad Historic District  and on the Marietta Street Artery  The city is divided into 25 neighborhood planning units or NPUs  which in turn are divided into 242 officially defined neighborhoods  37  The three major high rise districts within the city limits form a north south axis along Peachtree  Downtown  Midtown  and Buckhead  38  Surrounding these high density districts are leafy single family residential neighborhoods  39  40 Downtown contains many notable skyscrapers  the most office space in the metro area and many government offices  Further north is Midtown Atlanta  a major employment center  including many law offices  41  Between 1990 and 2010  a skyline of office and residential towers took shape  Upscale retail stores are opening  though scaled down from previous  2006  plans  Buckhead is eight miles  13 km  north of Downtown  The wealthy suburban area developed into a major commercial and financial center after Lenox Square mall opened in 1959  Skyscapers and hotels surround the mall  and around this commercial core are neighborhoods of single family homes ranging from upper middle class to very wealthy  Rowhouses in Glenwood Park  an example of gentrification in Atlanta Atlanta s east side is marked by historic streetcar suburbs built from the 1890s 1930s as havens for the upper middle class  Each of these neighborhoods are unique  containing separate commercial villages surrounded by leafy  architecturally distinct residential streets  East side neighborhoods include Victorian Inman Park and Grant Park  craftsman Virginia Highland and Kirkwood  and Bohemian Candler Park and East Atlanta  42  In West Midtown  former warehouses and factories have been transformed into condos  apartments  retail space  art galleries  and sophisticated restaurants  43  It is largely in these areas where the gentrification of Atlanta has taken place  transformed the city since the 1996 Olympics  As of 2010  Buckhead and northeastern Atlanta were on average 80  white  Downtown  Midtown  West Midtown  and some close in east side neighborhoods were the fastest growing areas of the city from 2000 to 2010  Bungalows in Inman Park Predominantly black neighborhoods cover 60  of the city s area  northwestern  southwestern  and southeastern Atlanta were 92  African American as of 2010  In Southwestern Atlanta  the areas closest to Downtown are streetcar suburbs such as the historic West End  these transition into postwar suburban neighborhoods  including Collier Heights and Cascade Heights  home to the city s established African American elite  44  45  Further out are newer neighborhoods that are also havens for middle class and upper class black homeowners  46  From 2000 to 2010 there was rapid population loss in northwestern Atlanta   24 1   and southeastern Atlanta   20 5    while small areas at the far west perimeter like Ben Hill grew quickly   45 8    The population of the Atlanta region spreads across a metropolitan area of 8 376 square miles  21 694

official count and the 2009 estimates caused some to question the reliability of the 2010 count  51  However  Atlanta s daytime population is much larger  According to a 2000 daytime population estimate by the Census Bureau  52  over 250 000 more people commuted to Atlanta on any given workday  boosting the city s estimated daytime population to 676 431  an increase of 62 4  over the

growth was the fastest amongst major cities  note 3  61  The city also became more diverse with portion of Non Hispanic Whites and Blacks dropping from 97 1  to 90 3  between 1990 2010 while the Metro area diversified much more quickly  The Hispanic and Asian populations doubled to become 10  and 5  of the population respectively between 2000 an 2010  63  Atlanta has one of the highest LGBT
