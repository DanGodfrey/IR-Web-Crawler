edit  Publication history This section requires expansion  Joe Simon was inspired at the moment he was considering an appropriate villain for Captain America  Coincidentally  he saw a hot fudge sundae melting and noticed how it was resembling a human like figure in the process  Although Simon initially considered calling this character Hot Fudge  the cherry on top seemed like an exposed skull as its head and he decided that the Red Skull was a more appropriate moniker  4  The Red Skull was introduced in Timely Comics  Captain America Comics  1  cover dated March 1941   written and drawn by the team of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby  The more enduring Johann Schmidt version of the Red Skull was created by writer France Herron 5  6  and artist Kirby  with Simon on inks   he first appeared in Captain America Comics  7  Oct  1941   The character was subsequently revived in the Silver Age of Comic Books  first in Tales of Suspense  65  May 1965  in the short lived Captain America early World War II period story run  and then was established as a contemporary villain in issue  79  July 1966   For decades  the character s true face was hidden  but in Captain America vol  1   297  Sept  1984  the Red Skull unmasked in front of the superhero with his face  albeit extremely aged  fully revealed  In the next issue  the Red Skull retells his story with his face fully visible in his various ages  When the character was revealed to be alive in issue  350  Feb  1989   in a story called  Resurrection   by John Byrne  the face of Johann Schmidt s original body is hidden again  but the Skull s face is fully visible  albeit in his cloned copy of Captain America s body  The character s origin was more fully illustrated in the limited series  Red Skull  Incarnate  with Schmidt s face fully visible again   edit  Fictional character biography This section s plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed  Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise   July 2011  The Red Skull  Johann Schmidt  sometimes spelled Shmidt   was a former Nazi general officer and confidant of Adolf Hitler  He has been closely affiliated with HYDRA and is an enemy of S H I E L D   the Avengers  and the interests of the United States and the free world in general  He was physically augmented by having his mind placed into the body of a clone of Captain America  the pinnacle of human perfection  He has been seemingly killed in the past  only to return time and time again to plague the world with schemes of world domination and genocide   edit  World War II era  edit  George Maxon Chronologically by publication date  the first Red Skull to appear in the 1940s comics was George John Maxon  an American businessman and Nazi agent who led a ring of spies and saboteurs  He faced Captain America during two of the latter s first missions  7  A formidable opponent in his own right  Maxon was thought killed during the last encounter  though he would reappear for one last encounter with Captain America in the Silver Age  Maxon was later revealed to be the agent of Johann Schmidt  the true Red Skull   edit  Johann Schmidt  the true Red Skull Johann Schmidt was born in a village in Germany to Hermann and Martha Schmidt  His mother died in childbirth and his father blamed Johann for her death  Johann s father tried to drown the baby  only to be stopped by the attending doctor  he later committed suicide  leaving Johann an orphan  The doctor took Johann to an orphanage  where the child led a lonely existence  Johann ran away from the orphanage when he was seven years old and lived on the streets as a beggar and a thief  As he grew older he worked at various menial jobs but spent most of his time in prison for crimes ranging from vagrancy to theft  As a young man Schmidt was from time to time employed by a Jewish shopkeeper  whose daughter  Esther  was the only person who had treated Schmidt kindly up to that point  Seized with passion for Esther  Schmidt tried to force himself upon her  only to be rejected by her  In unthinking fury  Schmidt murdered her  Schmidt fled the scene in terror  but also felt ecstatic joy in committing his first murder  In killing Esther he had given vent to the rage at the world that had been building up in him throughout his young life  8  In reality  as depicted in Red Skull  Incarnate  he actually defended Esther from attackers and violently rejected her after the subsequent death of her father and merely claimed to have murdered her to disturb Captain America who was in his clutches at that time  volume  amp  issue needed  According to the official version of the story told by the Red Skull and the Nazis  Schmidt met Hitler while working as a bellhop in a major hotel  This occurred during his late teens  around the same time that the Nazi Party gained power in Germany  Schmidt wound up serving the rooms of Adolf Hitler himself  By chance  Schmidt was present by bringing refreshments when the F hrer was furiously scolding an officer for letting a prisoner escape  during which Hitler pledged that he could create a better National Socialist out of the bellhop  Looking closely at the youth and sensing his dark inner nature  Hitler decided to take up the challenge and recruited Schmidt  8  In the series Red Skull  Incarnate  it has been revealed that Schmidt actually engineered his meeting with the F hrer with himself disguised as a bellhop  tricking his fellow orphan Dieter into trying to kill Hitler and then taking this opportunity to save Hitler s life  9  Dissatisfied with the standard drill instruction his subordinates used to train Schmidt  Hitler took over personally  and trained Schmidt as his right hand man  Upon completion  Hitler gave Schmidt a unique uniform with a grotesque red skull mask  and he emerged as the Red Skull  in literal German  Roter Totenkopf or Roter  Toten  Sch del  for the first time  His role was the embodiment of Nazi intimidation  while Hitler could remain the popular leader of Germany  To that end  The Red Skull was appointed head of Nazi terrorist activities with an additional large role in external espionage and sabotage  He succeeded  wreaking havoc throughout Europe in the early stages of World War II  The propaganda effect was so great that the United States government decided to counter it by creating their own equivalent using the one recipient of the lost Project Rebirth  Steve Rogers  as Captain America  8  In Europe during the war  the Skull took personal command of many military actions and personally supervised the takeovers and lootings of many cities and towns  in various cases the Skull ordered and supervised the eradication of the entire population of such communities  The Red Skull also organized a  wolf pack  of submarines which preyed upon shipping across the world  often under the Skull s personal command  volume  amp  issue needed  At first Hitler took great pride in his prot g  s successes and let the Skull have anything he wanted  Hitler thus financed the construction of secret bases for the Skull in various locations throughout the world  many of which were equipped with highly advanced experimental weapons and devices developed by Nazi scientists  The Skull was particularly interested in procuring technological weapons that could be used for the purposes of subversion and warfare  During the war he stole plans for the  nullatron   a device that could control human minds  adapted a space warping device developed by the cyborg scientist codenamed Brain Drain  and commissioned Nazi scientists to develop a projector which could encircle and suspend sections of cities within spheres of energy  But while the Skull always admired Hitler for his ideological vision  he was never content with being Hitler s subordinate  The Skull kidnapped and killed many of Hitler s closest advisers and eventually rose to become the second most powerful man in the Third Reich  Now Hitler could no longer effectively control the Skull and came to fear him  especially since the Skull had made little secret of his ambition to supplant Hitler someday  After the renowned military officer Baron Wolfgang von Strucker had a falling out with Hitler  the Red Skull sent Strucker to Japan to found an organization that would prepare the way for takeovers in the Far East under the Skull s leadership  volume  amp  issue needed  In the Far East Strucker joined a subversive organization that came to be known as HYDRA  broke his ties with the Skull  became head of HYDRA and built it into a major threat to world peace  volume  amp  issue needed  As World War II raged on  Hitler vowed  that if he could not conquer the world  he would destroy it  To achieve this end  the Skull proposed the construction of five gigantic war machines  to be called the Sleepers  which would be hidden in various locations while they generated and stored the power they would need  and then be released at a future date   Der Tag    The Day    to destroy the Earth if the Allies won  Hitler enthusiastically instructed the Skull to construct the Sleepers  unaware that the Skull intended to use them to conquer the world himself if Hitler s Third Reich fell  In the closing days of the war in Europe  Allied intelligence received reports of a Nazi doomsday plan code named  Der Tag  to be implemented after Hitler s defeat  However  the Allies had no idea what the plan entailed  Captain America and his teenage partner Bucky Barnes fought against and thwarted the Skull and his plans many times during the war  both working on their own and operating as members of the Invaders  Once they were captured by him  and Captain America was placed under Nazi control by a drug and told to assassinate a high ranking officer  but thanks to Bucky he broke free  volume  amp  issue needed  During the final days of World War II in Europe  Captain America and Bucky were assigned to England to prevent desperate Nazi efforts at sabotaging Allied supply bases there  volume  amp  issue needed  The Red Skull sent a number of his subordinates  who became known as the Exiles  and a large contingent of loyal German soldiers and their wives to a secret island base   Exile Island    where they would organize an army for use in the future  volume  amp  issue needed  The two counterparts soon clashed for the first time  10  The Skull later temporarily brainwashed three of the Invaders into serving him  11  The Red Skull and Captain America continued to engage in a series of skirmishes throughout the war  On one occasion the Skull captured Captain America and told him his origin  He placed Captain America under his control and tried to use him to kill a high ranking officer  but with Bucky s help Captain America broke free  12  Now that the German defeat was becoming a reality  the Red Skull was more determined than ever to obtain vengeance for his numerous personal defeats by Captain America and Bucky  The Skull assigned Baron Heinrich Zemo to go to England  and  under the cover of stealing an experimental Allied drone plane  to capture or kill Captain America and Bucky  However  the Skull was unaware that the Allies had just secretly parachuted Captain America into beleaguered Berlin to investigate  Der Tag   volume  amp  issue needed  Finally  Captain America tracked the Skull down to his hidden bunker  The Skull was about to hurl an armed hand grenade at his nemesis when Captain America threw his shield at him  The grenade went off  but the Skull was not killed  thanks to his body armor  He was  however  seriously hurt and partially buried in debris  Thinking he was dying  the Skull defiantly told Captain America that the Sleepers would avenge the Nazis  defeat  Then  suddenly  an Allied attack on Berlin began  An Allied plane dropped a huge blockbuster bomb on the bunker  causing a cave in that Captain America barely escaped  Captain America was picked up by the Allies and returned to England only to fall into Zemo s trap  which led to Captain America s falling into suspended animation for decades  Support pillars that crisscrossed over the Red Skull when the bunker caved in saved him from being struck by tons of rubble when the bomb hit  The cave in released an experimental gas from canisters in the bunker which put the Skull into suspended animation during which his wounds slowly healed  13   edit  Post World War II era  edit  Albert Malik With Schmidt s disappearance after 1945  the reputation of the Skull was still formidable enough to prove useful  In 1953  a Soviet Russian KGB agent named Albert Malik set up his spy criminal organization in Algeria and assumed the identity of the Red Skull  pretending that he was the original  when he was actually serving Soviet interests  During the 1950s  he faced the then active version of Captain America who was also using the identity of Steve Rogers  pretending to be the original  The two impersonators continued to battle each other throughout the decade  While the Captain and Bucky  Jack Monroe  were placed into suspended animation when his flawed replicate of the Super Soldier formula seriously affected his and Bucky s minds  Malik continued his activities  and over time cut his links to the Soviet Union  Among other notorious deeds  he was responsible for the deaths of Richard Parker and Mary Fitzpatrick Parker  the parents of Peter Parker  a k a  Spider Man   tipped off by the super criminal Gustav  The Gentleman  Fiers  Johann Schmidt s legacy continued to cause trouble in the years of his absence  This primarily came in the Sleepers which were activated by his agents as scheduled  Captain America was able to neutralize all the machines in turn   edit  Modern era The Red Skull wielding the Cosmic Cube  Tales of Suspense  80  Aug  1966   Cover art by Jack Kirby and Don Heck  Johann was eventually rescued and revived from suspended animation in modern times by the terrorist organization  AIM with his henchman  The Skull quickly subverted a cell to his own ambitions of world conquest and the death of Captain America  He stole the Cosmic Cube after taking control of its Keeper s mind with a device he planted while shaking hands  and revealed that he gave Zemo the order to steal the bomb plane that led to Bucky s death  He had had a rivalry with Zemo  and hoped to set his two foes against each other  Captain America found out from the dying pilot of a plane that had been following the Keeper s plane of the Cube  which had been used to destroy the plane  Schmidt told another AIM member of his plans after getting a mind control device on him  then caused him to shoot himself  He fought Captain America again for the first time in years after getting the Cube on an island  and created a superstrong humanoid monster to fight Captain America  Captain America began defeating it  so the Red Skull sent it away  He began sending Captain America to another dimension when Captain America offered to become his servant  The Red Skull encased himself in a golden suit of armor  and talked of creating a new order of knights  He planned to take over the world with the Cube  then create spaceships to conquer other worlds  Captain America defeated him by getting close to him while the Red Skull prepared to knight him  Captain America tried to get the Cube  and in the fight the island split apart due to the Cube s power  and the Skull fell off a cliff while trying to get the Cosmic Cube  14  When Johann reappeared  he and Malik  though his age was starting to catch up with him  started to antagonize each other while both claiming the identity of the Red Skull  volume  amp  issue needed  Finally Albert was the victim of an assassination organized by Johann  at the hands of a rogue agent of the Scourge of the Underworld  15  Thus the two enemies resumed their war  with Captain America  among other opponents  frustrating the Skull s schemes  The Skull captured part of Manhattan Island  16  unleashed the fourth Sleeper  and captured Captain America on Exile Island  17  The Skull then regained the reality altering Cosmic Cube and temporarily switched bodies with Captain America  He also used the Cube to alter the personality of  Snap  Wilson  the future Falcon  18  Some time later  he first fought Doctor Doom  19  The Red Skull then fomented racial hatred in New York  20  and was revealed as the true power behind the Las Vegas HYDRA faction  and first clashed with the Kingpin  21  Some time later  the Skull killed the would be Captain America  Roscoe  while Rogers had temporarily given up the role  He also revived the use of his  dust of death   22  The Skull later fought Doctor Doom on the moon but was defeated  23  With Arnim Zola  the Skull sought to transplant Hitler s brain into Captain America s body  24  He transformed a number of S H I E L D  agents into his skull faced slaves  25  The Skull teamed with the Hate Monger  a clone of Hitler  and trapped him in a flawed Cosmic Cube  26  The Skull led the Nihilist Order for a brief time  27  Establishing a Nazi colony on a deserted island  the Skull fathered a daughter who would eventually become known as Mother Superior  28  The war between Captain America and Red Skull in the modern era reached a breaking point when Red Skull discovered that the gas that had placed him in suspended animation was wearing off and his body was rapidly aging to what would be Skull s normal age  Now physically in his mid 80s  a weak and feeble Red Skull planned for a final showdown with his arch rival  Kidnapping Captain America s closest allies  he forced Captain America to surrender himself and forcibly undergo a medical treatment that aged Captain America s body to its rightful age  The two men  their bodies now ancient  fought one last battle to the death  Captain America refused to kill the Red Skull  who died cursing Captain America as his elderly body shut down  29  Dead at last  it seemed like the threat of the Red Skull had finally ended and The Avengers were able to restore Rogers  youth   edit  Resurrection The Red Skull would not stay dead for long  Nazi geneticist Arnim Zola  who had obtained DNA samples of Captain America years earlier  arranged for Skull s mind to be transplanted into a clone body of Captain America at the moment of his death  Assuming the identity of  John Smith   the English equivalent of his natural German name   Skull decided that he would reinvent himself and his quest for absolute power as a means to celebrate his cheating death  The Red Skull abandoned his longstanding beliefs in National Socialism and Hitler  on the belief that the Nazi philosophy made him look like a relic of the past  Skull instead turned towards American ideology for his new motivation  Skull saw much potential in the American dream of capitalism and self determination and set about establishing his own foothold inside Washington DC  culminating in him gaining control over  The Commission   a government body in Washington that monitored and regulated superhero activities  Skull also changed his mode of operations  rather than  living from one grand scheme to the next   he began financing a score of evil organizations that reported directly to him  most notably the militia group the Watchdogs  He also employed one of the Scourges  an organization who terrorized supervillains with a killing spree  Despite all of this  Skull s biggest move would be his plot to remove Rogers from the position of Captain America and replace him with a jingoist named John Walker  Although Walker initially attempted to live up to his predecessor s ideals  The Skull arranged for the murders of Walker s parents  driving him insane and into a downward spiral of murder as part of his plan to blacken the name of Captain America  30  Yet like all things  Skull s plans fell apart when Skull s chief pawn in the Commission was killed by Skull  right in front of Captain America  About to be exposed  Skull tried to manipulate Walker into killing Rogers  When Rogers defeated Walker  the Skull appeared to gloat at what he had done to Rogers and Walker and the reputation of Captain America  The Skull explained that this is part of his new operational method of engaging in multiple concurrent projects instead of investing consecutive grand schemes that his enemies could focus all their energies on stopping  Furthermore  these projects include killing Rogers at a time of his own choosing and that he could not touch Skull due to his status as a wealthy American businessman  Rogers  disturbed and puzzled by this mystery man with a face identical to his own and claiming to be his dead archenemy  noted that the Skull was not inhaling from the cigarette holder he had in his mouth  The cigarette turned out to be holding a lethal dose of the Skull s favorite poison  the Dust of Death  intended for Rogers   but the trap backfired against Schmidt when Walker suddenly hit him from behind with his shield  As a result  Schmidt suffered the facial disfigurement attributed to the Dust  as his face took on the appearance of a living red skull  his head is hairless and its skin has shriveled  clinging tightly to his actual skull  and has taken on a red discoloration  Skull did not die though  due to the effects of the Super Soldier formula  31  After this  the Skull masterminded a conflict between the United States and Symkaria  the nation of Silver Sable 32  He joined the  Acts of Vengeance  conspiracy  but was attacked by the mutant terrorist Magneto  a Holocaust survivor who wanted to punish him for his involvement in Hitler s regime  Magneto buried him alive with enough water for a few months  The Skull remained imprisoned  close to death and beginning to see the error of his ways  until he was rescued by his henchman Crossbones  33  The Red Skull s relationship with other villains was fraught with problems due to many villains shunning him because of his Nazi background  In the  Streets of Poison  storyline  the Skull proposes an alliance with the Kingpin to bring a new designer drug to New York but the Kingpin refuses to ally with the Nazi and the two engage in a drug war  He then defeats a weakened Skull in hand to hand combat  sparing his life on the condition he never come near the Kingpin s territory again  34  In the  Acts of Vengeance  crossover  the Skull demands the Wizard apologize for an insult to which the Wizard replies  You ll see yourself welcomed into Heaven before I speak those words   volume  amp  issue needed  Not long after that  he was kidnapped by Magneto  One prominent exception is fellow Nazi  Baron Wolfgang von Strucker  leader of the terrorist organization HYDRA  After the Skull s agents allow Strucker to be reborn  a grateful Strucker allows the Skull the use of HYDRA resources  35   edit  On the run Skull s tenure in Washington came to an end when Skull was captured by Hauptmann Deutschland  and taken to Germany to stand trial for crimes against humanity  stemming from his days as an agent of the Third Reich  Skull narrowly escaped and was rescued by Arnim Zola  and was forced to fake his death and go into hiding in a Rocky Mountain compound  He recruited the female sociopath  The Viper   a move that alienated his minions and was further rocked when his chief henchman Crossbones kidnapped Captain America s girlfriend Diamondback  resulting in Captain America finding Skull s new lair  Skull fired Crossbones  and went into hiding while the Viper  using funds she plied from Red Skull as part of a scheme to use televisions across America to blind TV viewers  was defeated by Captain America  36  Skull resurfaced during  Operation  AIM Island   where Skull discovered that he was facing the same permanent paralysis that Captain America was facing due to their exposure to the Super Soldier formula  37  When the evil scientist Superia offered Captain America a cure  Captain America refused it because Superia said that Captain America would  owe her   Skull took the cure and apparently killed Superia  then arranged for Captain America to be kidnapped by his remaining forces and given a blood transfusion that cured him  38   edit  Reluctant allies Captain America s recovery would segue into a reluctant team up with the Red Skull  a Nazi cult that worshiped Adolf Hitler as a god had discovered a Cosmic Cube that contained Hitler s mind  put there by Skull himself  The two sought to stop the cult from fully powering the Hitler Cosmic Cube but Skull opted instead to send Captain America  against his will  into the cube to kill Hitler  imprisoning Captain America in the cube while he used its power to conquer humanity  Captain America escaped and in the process used his shield to sever one of Skull s arms  causing him to drop the cube  The Cube then became unstable  destroying Skull  39   edit  Cosmic resurrection Trapped in a hellish nightmare dimension and forced to serve as a bellhop to a world of non European immigrants  Skull s will ultimately was so great that he was able to escape his prison  As a result  Skull now possessed limited reality warping powers that made him a truly cosmic threat  He was further aided by Korvac  who was posing as Kang the Conqueror  He was sent to Galactus  ship to steal more power  in particular the power of omniscience   which would remove all limits to Skull s reality warping powers  This led to Skull s undoing as he was ambushed by Korvac  Korvac stole Skull s cosmic powers and banished Skull back to Earth  40  The Red Skull later manipulated his way into the position of Secretary of Defense as Dell Rusk  an anagram for  red skull   to develop a biological weapon he tested at Mount Rushmore  41  He was exposed and defeated by the Avengers  The Black Panther beat him so badly that he broke the Skull s jaw in half  42   edit  Aleksander Lukin and the Winter Soldier The Red Skull  in Alexander Lukin s mind  Art by Steve Epting  The Red Skull was assassinated by the mysterious Winter Soldier  under orders from the renegade former Soviet general Aleksander Lukin  who wanted to possess the new Cosmic Cube the Skull had manufactured  43  When the Skull was shot  he attempted to use the Cube to switch bodies with Lukin to survive  but as the Cube was still weak he only managed to transfer his mind into Lukin s body  so that the two enemies are trapped together  waging a constant war for dominance which the Red Skull seems to be progressively winning  During a plot to lure out Captain America  Red Skull Lukin recruited several German skinheads and made them the successors to the Master Man  He then had these soldiers  dubbed the  Master Race   launch an attack on London  which was thwarted by Captain America  Spitfire  and Union Jack  Then  Red Skull Lukin activated a Sleeper  a robot programmed for mass destruction  that was presumably created by Doctor Doom  The robot damaged a significant portion of the new London Kronas HQ  and was ultimately destroyed by Captain America and Bucky  In the aftermath  Red Skull sent a videotape  announcing to the world his return  followed by Lukin holding a press conference condemning the actions of both the Red Skull and Captain America  and supporting the Superhero Registration Act  Then  in his office  Red Skull introduced Lukin to his old new associates  Crossbones and Sin  volume  amp  issue needed  With America s superheroes divided over the act  the Skull manipulates events to his own ends  with the aid of Doctor Faustus  Doctor Doom  and Arnim Zola  His plans involved the reunion of Captain America and his former lover Sharon Carter  who is being manipulated by Faustus  volume  amp  issue needed  In the immediate aftermath of the Civil War  the Skull puts his plans into action  arranging for Crossbones to shoot Captain America as he enters a courthouse in New York City  in the ensuing chaos  Carter  acting under Faustus  mental directive  assassinates Captain America  This is only the first phase of the Skull s evil plan  Upon the discovery of his identity as Lukin  the Skull fakes his death  and initiates the second part of his plan  using Kronas Corporation s vast holdings to economically cripple the United States  before having S H I E L D  agents brainwashed by Doctor Faustus open fire on crowds of protesters in front of the White House  The Red Skull continues his assault by engineering a riot by placing Kronas security troops and drugged water in a protest on the Lincoln Monument  44  All of this has apparently been to elevate his puppet politician  Gordon Wright  elevated in the public s eye with being credited as  resolving  the situations  as well as surviving a  staged  attack by the Serpent Squad  Once elected  Wright will lead the country directly into a police state secretly controlled by the Red Skull  The Skull also plans to transfer his consciousness into Sharon s unborn child  apparently sired by Steve Rogers himself and potentially having inherited his Project Rebirth enhancements  45  Both schemes fail because of the impatience and incompetence of the Skull s daughter   her near fatal attack on Sharon Carter causes her to lose the baby  and she intentionally botches her pseudo assassination of Gordon Wright by attempting to kill him for real  As Faustus has surreptitiously tampered with Sharon s programming  she is able to rebel  and before escaping shoots Lukin to death  This is not the end of Red Skull  since Arnim Zola had seconds earlier transferred his mind to one of his spare robotic bodies  but after having his current form damaged by the imposter Captain America  he s unable to return back to Red Skull  essentially trapping him in his current robotic form for the time being  46   edit  Captain America  Reborn It has been revealed that Red Skull did not actually kill Steve Rogers  but trapped his body in a fixed position in space and time  He was planning on using Sharon and a machine created by Doctor Doom to return his body back to their time  but since Sharon destroyed the machine  his body is now drifting through time and space  47  Apparently  it is presumed that the Red Skull intended to transfer his mind into Rogers  body  Norman Osborn decides to assist in completing his plan as Captain America leading his team of Avengers would increase his popularity in his stolen Iron Man suit  48  Sin and Crossbones find him and take him to Latveria in order to place the Red Skull s mind in a living body  49  The Red Skull  Sin  and Crossbones land in Latveria and Doom confronts them  saying that he would kill them if he was not a man of his word  Doom and Zola complete the machine and  after Ms  Hand brings Sharon to them  they strap her in  They activate the machine and soon Steve Rogers  body returns  When Steve opens his eyes  they are shown to be red  signifying that the Red Skull is now in control  50  Steve Rogers still resides in the body  and during the Red Skull s invasion of Washington D C   he and Steve battle in the mind of Steve s body  51  Steve eventually forces Red Skull out  placing him back into his robot body  To prevent him from escaping the immediate area  Sharon Carter hits the Red Skull with a shot of Pym Particles  making him a massive robot who cannot elude any pursuer s attention  While Rogers and the Avengers keep Schmidt occupied with a team attack  he is destroyed by a missile barrage fired by Sharon Carter on a hijacked AIM battleship  In the epilogue  it was shown that Sin was too close to the exploding robot  and her face was heavily scarred  leaving her looking just like her father  52   edit  Powers and abilities Although the Red Skull has no superhuman abilities  he possesses an intellect and inventive genius on the level of supervillains such as Doctor Doom  and is a highly gifted subversive strategist and political operative  At one point  the Red Skull s mind inhabited a body cloned from Captain America s  and hence possessed the mutagenic alterations induced by the Super Soldier formula  He was thus endowed with a body that was in perfect physical condition  with strength  speed  durability  agility  dexterity  reflexes  coordination  balance  and physical endurance that exceeded that of any Olympic athlete who ever performed  Despite the scar tissue covering his face and head  his senses were still above average  He has been shown as a superb martial artist  though he was never on par with Captain America himself  he was originally trained by German athletes appointed by Hitler  and is heavily trained as a skilled marksman with various forms of handguns  and well versed in the use of fire arms and explosives  While sharing Alexander Lukin s body  he lost his superhuman abilities  Since then he resides in one of the android bodies engineered by Arnim Zola  with enhanced endurance and resilience  He typically armed himself with a trick cigarette that could fire fatal poison gas   his trademark  Dust of Death    toward his victim  The  Dust of Death  is a red powder which kills a victim within seconds of skin contact  The powder causes the skin of the victim s head to shrivel  tighten  and take on a red discoloration  while causing the hair to fall out  Hence the victim s head resembles a  red skull   He also carries a large arsenal of conventional and advanced fire arms and explosives   edit  Other versions  edit  Earth 110 Red Skull allied with Doctor Doom  Hulk  Magneto  Namor  and Ultron in order to take over Manhattan  53   edit  JLA

Skull Ultimate Red Skull shown on the variant cover to Ultimate Comics  Avengers  1  Art by Leinil Yu  The Ultimate Red Skull first appears in Ultimate Comics  Avengers created by Mark Millar  This Red Skull is the illegitimate son of Captain America and Gail Richards  conceived before the Captain s presumed death during WWII  Taken from Richards  the son is raised on an army base where he appears to be a well adjusted  physically superior  and tactically brilliant young man who greatly resembles his father  His easy going personality is a ruse  Around the age of seventeen  he kills over 200 men on the base  and then cuts off his own face  this last act being interpreted as part of his efforts to reject his father  60  As a final symbol of his rebellion against the system that created him  he assassinates President John F  Kennedy in 1963  61  After decades of working as a professional assassin  the Red Skull joins A I M  He and his men steal the blueprints of the Cosmic

of his power he has the entire Alaskan A I M  team cannibalize each other  When the Avengers arrive on the scene they immediately try to destroy him but the Cube imbues him with nearly unlimited power  making him absolutely invulnerable  During the battle with the Avengers he beats them mercilessly  Captain America arrives in a stolen Teleporter Jet  but Skull forces the jet to crash  Cap survives the crash and teleports the jet to the Red Skull s exact coordinates  impaling him on one of the two rods that protrude from its nose  62  The Red Skull is taken to a hospital and kept alive long enough for Gail Richards  his mother  to say her goodbyes  Skull explains to Nick Fury that all he wanted to do with the Cosmic Cube was to turn back time and prevent Steve Rogers  his father  from being lost during the war so that he could grow up with him and lead a normal life  rather than the one he was given  Petra Laskov  a woman whom he forced to kill her husband then her infant son
