The American Civil War  1861 1865   often referred to simply as The Civil War in the United States  was a civil war fought in the United States of America  In response to the election of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States  11 southern slave states declared their secession from the United States and formed the Confederate States of America   the Confederacy    the other 25 states supported the federal government   the Union    After four years of warfare  mostly within the Southern states  the Confederacy surrendered and slavery was outlawed everywhere in the nation  Issues that led to war were partially resolved in the Reconstruction Era that followed  though others remained unresolved  In the presidential election of 1860  the Republican Party  led by Abraham Lincoln  had campaigned against expanding slavery beyond the states in which it already existed  The Republicans strongly advocated nationalism  and in their 1860 platform they denounced threats of disunion as avowals of treason  After a Republican victory  but before the new administration took office on March 4  1861  seven cotton states declared their secession and joined to form the Confederate States of America  Both the outgoing administration of President James Buchanan and the incoming administration rejected the legality of secession  considering it rebellion  The other eight slave states rejected calls for secession at this point  No country in the world recognized the Confederacy  Hostilities began on April 12  1861  when Confederate forces attacked a U S  military installation at Fort Sumter in South Carolina  Lincoln responded by calling for a volunteer army from each state to recapture federal property  which led to declarations of secession by four more slave states  Both sides raised armies as the Union seized control of the border states early in the war and established a naval blockade  Land warfare in the East was inconclusive in 1861 62  as the Confederacy beat back Union efforts to capture its capital  Richmond  Virginia  notably during the Peninsular Campaign  In September 1862  the Confederate campaign in Maryland ended in defeat at the Battle of Antietam  which dissuaded the British from intervening  2  Days after that battle  Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation  which made ending slavery a war goal  3  In 1863  Confederate general Robert E  Lee s northward advance ended in defeat at the Battle of Gettysburg  To the west  the Union gained control of the Mississippi River after the Battle of Shiloh and Siege of Vicksburg  splitting the Confederacy in two and destroying much of their western army  Due to his western successes  Ulysses S  Grant was given command of the eastern army in 1864  and organized the armies of William Tecumseh Sherman  Philip Sheridan and others to attack the Confederacy from all directions  increasing the North s advantage in manpower  Grant restructured the union army  and put other generals in command of divisions of the army that were to support his push into Virginia  He fought several battles of attrition against Lee through the Overland Campaign to seize Richmond  though in the face of fierce resistance he altered his plans and led the Siege of Petersburg which nearly finished off the rest of Lee s army  Meanwhile  Sherman captured Atlanta and marched to the sea  destroying Confederate infrastructure along the way  When the Confederate attempt to defend Petersburg failed  the Confederate army retreated but was pursued and defeated  which resulted in Lee s surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9  1865  The American Civil War was one of the earliest true industrial wars  Railroads  the telegraph  steamships  and mass produced weapons were employed extensively  The practices of total war  developed by Sherman in Georgia  and of trench warfare around Petersburg foreshadowed World War I in Europe  It remains the deadliest war in American history  resulting in the deaths of 620 000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties  Historian John Huddleston estimates the death toll at ten percent of all Northern males 20 45 years old  and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18 40  4  Victory for the North meant the end of the Confederacy and of slavery in the United States  and strengthened the role of the federal government  The social  political  economic and racial issues of the war decisively shaped the reconstruction era that lasted to 1877  Contents 1 Causes of secession 1 1 Slavery 1 2

States Portal v t e The causes of the Civil War were complex  and have been controversial since the war began  The issue has been further complicated by historical revisionists  who have tried to improve the image of the South by lessening the role of slavery  5  Slavery was the central source of escalating political tension in the 1850s  The Republican Party was determined to prevent any spread of slavery  and many Southern leaders had threatened secession if the Republican candidate  Lincoln  won the 1860 election  Following Lincoln s victory  many Southern whites felt that disunion had become their only option  While not all Southerners saw themselves as fighting to preserve slavery  most of the officers and over a third of the rank and file in Lee s army had close family ties to slavery  To Northerners  in contrast  the motivation was primarily to preserve the Union  not to abolish slavery  6  Abraham Lincoln consistently made preserving the Union the central goal of the war  though he increasingly saw slavery as a crucial issue and made ending it an additional goal  7  Lincoln s decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation angered both Peace Democrats   Copperheads   and War Democrats  but energized most Republicans  8  By warning that free blacks would flood the North  Democrats made gains in the 1862 elections  but they did not gain control of Congress  The Republicans  counterargument that slavery was the mainstay of the enemy steadily gained support  with the Democrats crushed at the 1863 elections in Ohio when they tried to resurrect anti black sentiment  9  Slavery Main article  Slavery in the United States The slavery issue addressed not only the well being of the slaves  although abolitionists raised the issue  but also the question of whether slavery was an anachronistic evil that was incompatible with American values or a profitable economic system protected by the Constitution  All sides agreed slavery exhausted the land and had to find new lands to survive  The strategy of the anti slavery forces was to stop the expansion and thus put slavery on a path to gradual extinction  To the South this strategy made Southerners second class citizens and trampled their Constitutional rights  The anti slavery movement in the United States had roots in the Declaration of Independence  Slavery was banned in the Northwest Territory with the Northwest Ordinance of 1787  By 1804 all the Northern states  states north of the Mason Dixon line  had passed laws to abolish slavery gradually  Congress in 1807 banned the international slave trade  Slavery faded in the border states and urban areas but expanded in highly profitable cotton states of the Deep South  Despite compromises in 1820 and 1850  the slavery issues exploded in the 1850s  The new Republican Party angered slavery interests by demanding the end to its expansion  The Republican idea was that without expansion slavery would eventually die out  as it did in other nations   Abraham Lincoln  for example  in his 1858 House Divided Speech  called for America to  arrest the further spread of it  and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction   10  Much of the political battle in the 1850s focused on the expansion of slavery into the newly created territories  11  12  Eric Foner notes that both North and South assumed that if slavery could not expand  it would wither and die  13  Lincoln in 1845 explained how slavery could die a natural death   we should never knowingly lend ourselves directly or indirectly  to prevent that slavery from dying a natural death   to find new places for it to live in  when it can no longer exist in the old   14  With tobacco and cotton wearing out the soil so fast  the South needed to expand to new lands  15  and many wanted to reopen the international slave trade  16  Southern fears of losing control of the federal government to antislavery forces  and Northern resentment of the influence that the Slave Power already wielded in government  brought the crisis to a head in the late 1850s  Disagreements between Abolitionists and others over the morality of slavery  the scope of democracy and the economic merits of free labor versus slave plantations caused the Whig and  Know Nothing  parties to collapse  and new ones to arise  the Free Soil Party in 1848  the Republicans in 1854  the Constitutional Union in 1860   In 1860  the last national political party  the Democratic Party  split along sectional lines  Northerners ranging from the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison to the moderate Republican leader Lincoln 17  stressed Jefferson s declaration that all men are created equal  Lincoln mentioned this proposition many times  including his 1863 Gettysburg Address  Almost all the inter regional crises involved slavery  starting with debates on the three fifths clause and a twenty year extension of the African slave trade in the Constitutional Convention of 1787  The 1793 invention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney increased by fiftyfold the quantity of cotton that could be processed in a day and greatly increased the demand for slave labor in the South  18  There was controversy over adding the slave state of Missouri to the Union that led to the Missouri Compromise of 1820  A gag rule prevented discussion in Congress of petitions for ending slavery from 1835 1844  while Manifest Destiny became an argument for gaining new territories  where slavery could expand  The acquisition of Texas as a slave state in 1845 along with territories won as a result of the Mexican American War  1846 1848  resulted in the Compromise of 1850  19  The Wilmot Proviso was an attempt by Northern politicians to exclude slavery from the territories conquered from Mexico  The extremely popular anti slavery novel Uncle Tom s Cabin  1852  by Harriet Beecher Stowe greatly increased Northern opposition to the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850  20  21  John Brown being adored by an enslaved mother and child as he walks to his execution on December 2  1859  The 1854 Ostend Manifesto was an unsuccessful Southern attempt to annex Cuba as a slave state  The Second Party System broke down after passage of the Kansas Nebraska Act in 1854  which replaced the Missouri Compromise ban on slavery with popular sovereignty  allowing the people of a territory to vote for or against slavery  The Bleeding Kansas controversy over the status of slavery in the Kansas Territory included massive vote fraud perpetrated by Missouri pro slavery Border Ruffians  Vote fraud led pro South Presidents Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan to attempt to admit Kansas as a slave state  Buchanan supported the pro slavery Lecompton Constitution  22  Violence over the status of slavery in Kansas erupted with the Wakarusa War  23  the Sacking of Lawrence  24  the caning of Republican Charles Sumner by the Southerner Preston Brooks  25  26  the Pottawatomie Massacre  27  the Battle of Black Jack  the Battle of Osawatomie and the Marais des Cygnes massacre  The 1857 Supreme Court Dred Scott decision allowed slavery in the territories even where the majority opposed slavery  including Kansas  The Lincoln Douglas debates of 1858 included Northern Democratic leader Stephen A  Douglas  Freeport Doctrine  This doctrine was an argument for thwarting the Dred Scott decision that  along with Douglas  defeat of the Lecompton Constitution  divided the Democratic Party between North and South  Northern abolitionist John Brown s raid at Harpers Ferry Armory was an attempt to incite slave insurrections in 1859  28  The North South split in the Democratic Party in 1860 due to the Southern demand for a slave code for the territories completed polarization of the nation between North and South  James Hopkinson s Plantation  Planting sweet potatoes  ca  1862 63  Scars of whipped slave  This famous 1863 photo was distributed by abolitionists to illustrate what they saw as the barbarism of Southern society  29  The victim likely suffered from keloid  according to Kathleen Collins  making the scars more prominent and extensive  30  Support for secession was strongly correlated to the number of plantations in the region  31  States of the Deep South  which had the greatest concentration of plantations  were the first to secede  The upper South slave states of Virginia  North Carolina  Arkansas  and Tennessee had fewer plantations and rejected secession until the Fort Sumter crisis forced them to choose sides  Border states had fewer plantations still and never seceded  32  33  As of 1860 the percentage of Southern families that owned slaves has been estimated to be 43 percent in the lower South  36 percent in the upper South and 22 percent in the border states that fought mostly for the Union  34  Half the owners had one to four slaves  A total of 8000 planters owned 50 or more slaves in 1850 and only 1800 planters owned 100 or more  of the latter  85  lived in the lower South  as opposed to one percent in the border states  35  According to the 1860 U S  census  393 975 individuals  representing 8 percent of all US families  owned 3 950 528 slaves  36  Ninety five percent of African Americans lived in the South  comprising one third of the population there as opposed to one percent of the population of the North  chiefly in larger cities like New York and Philadelphia  Consequently  fears of eventual emancipation were much greater in the South than in the North  37  The Supreme Court decision of 1857 in Dred Scott v  Sandford escalated the controversy  Chief Justice Roger B  Taney s decision said that slaves were  so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect   38  Taney then overturned the Missouri Compromise  which banned slavery in territory north of the 36 30  parallel  He stated    T he Act of Congress which prohibited a citizen from holding and owning  enslaved persons  in the territory of the United States north of the line therein is not warranted by the Constitution and is therefore void   39  Southern Democrats praised the Dred Scott decision  but Republicans branded it a  willful perversion  of the Constitution  They argued that if Scott could not legally file suit  the Supreme Court had no right to consider the Missouri Compromise s constitutionality  Lincoln warned that  the next Dred Scott decision  40  could threaten Northern states with slavery  Lincoln said   This question of Slavery was more important than any other  indeed  so much more important has it become that no other national question can even get a hearing just at present   41  The slavery issue was related to sectional competition for control of the territories  42  and the Southern demand for a slave code for the territories was the issue used by Southern politicians to split the Democratic Party in two  which all but guaranteed the election of Lincoln and secession  When secession was an issue  South Carolina planter and state Senator John Townsend said that   our enemies are about to take possession of the Government  that they intend to rule us according to the caprices of their fanatical theories  and according to the declared purposes of abolishing slavery   43  Similar opinions were expressed throughout the South in editorials  political speeches and declarations of reasons for secession  Even though Lincoln had no plans to outlaw slavery where it existed  whites throughout the South expressed fears for the future of slavery  Southern concerns included not only economic loss but also fears of racial equality  44  45  46  47  The Texas Declaration of Causes for Secession 48  49  said that the non slave holding states were  proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality of all men  irrespective of race or color   and that the African race  were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race   Alabama secessionist E  S  Dargan warned that whites and free blacks could not live together  if slaves were emancipated and remained in the South   we ourselves would become the executioners of our own slaves  To this extent would the policy of our Northern enemies drive us  and thus would we not only be reduced to poverty  but what is still worse  we should be driven to crime  to the commission of sin   50  Beginning in the 1830s  the US Postmaster General refused to allow mail which carried abolition pamphlets to the South  51  Northern teachers suspected of any tinge of abolitionism were expelled from the South  and abolitionist literature was banned  Southerners rejected the denials of Republicans that they were abolitionists  52  The North felt threatened as well  for as Eric Foner concludes   Northerners came to view slavery as the very antithesis of the good society  as well as a threat to their own fundamental values and interests   53  During the 1850s  slaves left the border states through sale  manumission and escape  and border states also had more free African Americans and European immigrants than the lower South  which increased Southern fears that slavery was threatened with rapid extinction in this area  Such fears greatly increased Southern efforts to make Kansas a slave state  By 1860  the number of white border state families owning slaves plunged to only 16 percent of the total  Slaves sold to lower South states were owned by a smaller number of wealthy slave owners as the price of slaves increased  54  Even though Lincoln agreed to the Corwin Amendment  which would have protected slavery in existing states  secessionists claimed that such guarantees were meaningless  Besides the loss of Kansas to free soil Northerners  secessionists feared that the loss of slaves in the border states would lead to emancipation  and that upper South slave states might be the next dominoes to fall  They feared that Republicans would use patronage to incite slaves and antislavery Southern whites such as Hinton Rowan Helper  Then slavery in the lower South  like a  scorpion encircled by fire  would sting itself to death   55  According to historian Chandra Manning  both Union and Confederate soldiers who did the actual fighting believed slavery to be the cause of the Civil War  He argues that a majority of Confederate soldiers fought to protect slavery  which they viewed as an integral part of southern economy  culture  and manhood  Further  he argues that Union soldiers believed the primary reason for the war was to bring emancipation to the slaves  However  many Union soldiers did not fully endorse the idea of shedding their own blood for African American slaves  whom they viewed as inferior  Manning s research involved reading military camp newspapers and personal correspondence between soldiers and families during the Civil War  Manning stated that the primary debate in Confederate states over secession was not over state rights  but rather  the power of the federal government to affect the institution of slavery  specifically limiting it in newly added territories   56  Other historians  such as Eric Foner  argue that no two people held the same motivations  He argues that while some were motivated mainly by slavery  most were motivated by some mixture of politics  culture  nationalism  honor  or any other number of motivations  2  Sectionalism Status of the states  1861     States that seceded before April 15  1861    States that seceded after April 15  1861    Union states that permitted slavery    Union states that banned slavery    Territories Sectionalism refers to the different economies  social structure  customs and political values of the North and South  57  58  It increased steadily between 1800 and 1860 as the North  which phased slavery out of existence  industrialized  urbanized and built prosperous farms  while the deep South concentrated on plantation agriculture based on slave labor  together with subsistence farming for the poor whites  The South expanded into rich new lands in the Southwest  from Alabama to Texas   59  However  slavery declined in the border states and could barely survive in cities and industrial areas  it was fading out in cities such as Baltimore  Louisville and St  Louis   so a South based on slavery was rural and non industrial  On the other hand  as the demand for cotton grew the price of slaves soared  Historians have debated whether economic differences between the industrial Northeast and the agricultural South helped cause the war  Most historians now disagree with the economic determinism of historian Charles Beard in the 1920s and emphasize that Northern and Southern economies were largely complementary  60  Fears of slave revolts and abolitionist propaganda made the South militantly hostile to abolitionism  61  62  Southerners complained that it was the North that was changing  and was prone to new  isms   while the South remained true to historic republican values of the Founding Fathers  many of whom owned slaves  including Washington  Jefferson and Madison   Lincoln said that Republicans were following the tradition of the framers of the Constitution  including the Northwest Ordinance and the Missouri Compromise  by preventing expansion of slavery  63  The issue of accepting slavery  in the guise of rejecting slave owning bishops and missionaries  split the largest religious denominations  the Methodist  Baptist and Presbyterian churches  into separate Northern and Southern denominations  64  Industrialization meant that seven European immigrants out of eight settled in the North  The movement of twice as many whites leaving the South for the North as vice versa contributed to the South s defensive aggressive political behavior  65  The Territorial Crisis and the United States Constitution Between 1803 and 1854  a vast expansion of US territory was achieved through purchase  negotiation and conquest  These acquisitions included over a million and a quarter square miles acquired in just the last decade of this period alone  66  Of the states carved out of these territories by 1845  all had entered the union as slave states  Louisiana  Missouri  Arkansas  Florida and Texas  as well as the southern portions of Alabama and Mississippi  67  And with the conquest of northern Mexico  including California  in 1848  slaveholding interests looked forward to the institution flourishing in these lands as well  Southerners also anticipated garnering slaves and slave states in Cuba and Central America  67  68  Northern free soil interests vigorously sought to curtail any further expansion of slave soil  It was over these territorial disputes that the proslavery and antislavery forces collided over the future of slavery in America  69  70  Woman with her slave  New Orleans  1850 The existence of slavery in the southern states was far less politically polarizing than the explosive question of the territorial expansion of the institution in the west  71  Moreover  Americans were informed by two well established readings of the Constitution regarding human bondage  First  that the slave states had complete autonomy over the institution within their boundaries  and second  that the domestic slave trade   trade among the states   was immune to federal interference  72  73  With the outlawing and criminalization of the Atlantic slave trade in 1808 and 1820  the only constitutionally feasible strategy available to freesoilers to attack slavery was to restrict its introduction into the territories  A policy of  containment    limiting slavery to where it already existed   would set the institution on a trajectory towards  ultimate extinction   74  Slaveholding interests fully grasped the danger that this strategy posed to the security and perpetuation of human bondage  75  76  Both the South and the North drew an identical conclusion   The power to decide the question of slavery for the territories was the power to determine the future of slavery itself   77  78  Four doctrines  each mutually irreconcilable  emerged to provide the answer to the question of federal control in the territories  All these theories claimed to be sanctioned by  or derived from  the Constitution   either explicitly or implicitly  79  The traditional or  conservative  position was based on Article 4  Section 3  Clause 2 of the Constitution   The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States  and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States  or of any particular State   From these enumerated powers  two of the four doctrines emerged  each arguing that Congress had full authority to decide the fate of slavery in the territories  The precedents of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 and the Missouri Compromise of 1820 were cited by proponents of federal control  In each of these historic compromises  the territories under consideration were divided into an explicitly designated free soil region  as well as an undesignated region lacking a slavery exclusion clause  In other words  the legislation provided for  but did not require  a balance between free soil and slave soil  In all areas not placed off limits to slavery  the institution was quickly established there  80  Here  the two traditional or  conservative  doctrines parted ways  The Constitutional Union Party regarded Congressional allocation of free soil and  implicitly  slave soil territory as an established method of compromise  Any dispute over slavery expansion was to end in similar apportionments  The Crittenden Compromise of 1860 was an expression of this political outlook  81  The Republican Party  which also championed federal control over territories  rejected this narrow interpretation of the precedents  They insisted that the clause conveying authority to Congress in the territories did not bind legislators to any particular policy  slavery could be constitutionally excluded altogether in a territory at their discretion  81  The only caveat the Republicans issued was that the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment be applied in the territories to slavery  Congress might positively prohibit slavery  but they could never establish it  to do so  according to the Republicans  would amount to a federal mandate for slavery and violate the principles of the Declaration of Independence  82  83  Illinois Senator Stephen A  Douglas and his southern Democratic Party allies devised the third of these political theories  territorial sovereignty  By this doctrine Congress would relinquish direct federal control over the internal affairs of territories regarding slavery  In this respect  territorial sovereignty  also known as  popular  or  squatter  sovereignty  diverged sharply from the two aforementioned conservative theories  83  Douglas declared that  the people of every separate political community    be it a state  a territory  or otherwise    have an inalienable right to govern themselves  with respect to local concerns  Among these local concerns  Douglas included slavery  When challenged to explain how territorial sovereignty trumped the role of Congress as enumerated in Article Four  he replied this way  that Congress was empowered only to confer authority into the hands of the territorial government  but never to exercise any direct control  including the establishment of social institutions  84  The fourth in this quartet of constitutional doctrines was that of state sovereignty  also known as states  rights   Among the principles of state sovereignty was that all authority regarding the institution of slavery in the territories resided in the slave states themselves  The role of the federal government was merely to enable the implementation of slave state laws when residents of the states entered the territories  85  As early as 1847  shortly after the introduction of the Wilmot Proviso  the ideology of state sovereignty emerged as a rebuttal and antidote to free soil claims to the Mexican Cession  86  87  South Carolinian statesman John C  Calhoun asserted that the federal government in the territories was only the trustee or agent of the several sovereign states  obliged not to discriminate among the states and hence incapable of forbidding the bringing into any territory of anything that was legal property in any state  He concluded that citizens from every state had the right to take their property to any territory  88  State sovereignty gave the laws of the slaveholding states extra jurisdictional effect  The slave owner and his property would settle in a territory much as a colonist settled in early colonial America  all rights and privileges recognized in the mother country  or sovereign slave state  would be retained by the colonists in their new home  US territory   The United States federal government would be bound by law to protect the settlers sovereign  rights  and intercede on their behalf if state statutes were threatened  85  Essentially   states  rights  was an ideology formulated and applied as a means of advancing slave state interests through federal authority and thwarting free state interests  by application of the same federal authority  89  As historian Thomas L Krannawitter points out    T he Southern demand for federal slave protection represented a demand for an unprecedented expansion of federal power   90  By 1860  these four doctrines comprised the major ideologies presented to the American public on the matters of slavery  the territories and the US Constitution  91  Nationalism and honor Nationalism was a powerful force in the early 19th century  with famous spokesmen like Andrew Jackson and Daniel Webster  While practically all Northerners supported the Union  Southerners were split between those loyal to the entire United States  called  unionists   and those loyal primarily to the southern region and then the Confederacy  92 C  Vann Woodward said of the latter group   A great slave society   had grown up and miraculously flourished in the heart of a thoroughly bourgeois and partly puritanical republic  It had renounced its bourgeois origins and elaborated and painfully rationalized its institutional  legal  metaphysical  and religious defenses    When the crisis came it chose to fight  It proved to be the death struggle of a society  which went down in ruins   93  Perceived insults to Southern collective honor included the publication of Uncle Tom s Cabin  1854  94  and the actions of John Brown in 1859  95  While the South moved toward a Southern nationalism  leaders in the North were also becoming more nationally minded  and rejected any notion of splitting the Union  The Republican national electoral platform of 1860 warned that Republicans regarded disunion as treason and would not tolerate it  we denounce those threats of disunion   as denying the vital principles of a free government  and as an avowal of contemplated treason  which it is the imperative duty of an indignant people sternly to rebuke and forever silence  96  The South ignored the warnings  Southerners did not realize how ardently the North would fight to hold the Union together  97  States  rights Main article  States  rights Everyone agreed that states had certain rights but did those rights carry over when a citizen left that state  The Southern position was that citizens of every state had the right to take their property anywhere in the U S  and not have it taken away specifically they could bring their slaves anywhere and they would remain slaves  Northerners rejected this  right  because it would violate the right of a free state to outlaw slavery within its borders  Republicans committed to ending the expansion of slavery were among those opposed to any such right to bring slaves and slavery into the free states and territories  The Dred Scott Supreme Court decision of 1857 bolstered the Southern case within territories  and angered the North  98  Secondly the South argued that each state had the right to secede leave the Union at any time  that the Constitution was a  compact  or agreement among the states  Northerners  including President Buchanan  rejected that notion as opposed to the will of the Founding Fathers who said they were setting up a  perpetual union   98  Historian James McPherson writes concerning states  rights and other non slavery explanations  While one or more of these interpretations remain popular among the Sons of Confederate Veterans and other Southern heritage groups  few professional historians now subscribe to them  Of all these interpretations  the state s rights argument is perhaps the weakest  It fails to ask the question  state s rights for what purpose  State s rights  or sovereignty  was always more a means than an end  an instrument to achieve a certain goal more than a principle  99  Slave power and free soil issues Main article  Slave Power Marais des Cygnes massacre of anti slavery Kansans  May 19  1858  Antislavery forces in the North identified the  Slave Power  as a direct threat to republican values  They argued that rich slave owners were using political power to take control of the Presidency  Congress and the Supreme Court  thus threatening the rights of the citizens of the North  100   Free soil  was a Northern demand that the new lands opening up in the west be available to independent yeoman farmers and not be bought out by rich slave owners who would buy up the best land and work it with slaves  forcing the white farmers onto marginal lands  This was the basis of the Free Soil Party of 1848  and a main theme of the Republican Party  101  Free Soilers and Republicans demanded a homestead law that would give government land to settlers  it was defeated by Southerners who feared it would attract to the west European immigrants and poor Southern whites  102  Tariffs Main article  Tariffs in United States history The Democrats in Congress  controlled by Southerners  wrote the tariff laws in the 1830s  1840s  and 1850s  and kept reducing rates  so that the 1857 rates were the lowest since 1816  The South had no complaints but the low rates angered Northern industrialists and factory workers  especially in Pennsylvania  who demanded protection for their growing iron industry  The Whigs and Republicans complained because they favored high tariffs to stimulate industrial growth  and Republicans called for an increase in tariffs in the 1860 election  The increases were finally enacted in 1861 after Southerners resigned their seats in Congress  103  104  Historians in recent decades have minimized the tariff issue  noting that few Southerners in 1860 61 said it was of central importance to them  Some secessionist documents do mention the tariff issue  though not nearly as often as the preservation of slavery  Election of Lincoln Main article  United States presidential election  1860 Abraham Lincoln  16th President  1861 1865  The election of Lincoln in November 1860 was the final trigger for secession  105  Efforts at compromise  including the  Corwin Amendment  and the  Crittenden Compromise   failed  Southern leaders feared that Lincoln would stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinction  The slave states  which had already become a minority in the House of Representatives  were now facing a future as a perpetual minority in the Senate and Electoral College against an increasingly powerful North  Before Lincoln took office in March 1861  seven slave states had declared their secession and joined to form the Confederacy  Battle of Fort Sumter Main article  Battle of Fort Sumter The Lincoln Administration  just as the outgoing Buchanan administration before it  refused to turn over Ft  Sumter located in the middle of the harbor of Charleston  South Carolina  Jefferson Davis ordered the surrender of the fort  Union Maj  Anderson gave a conditional reply which the Confederate government rejected  and Davis ordered Beauregard to attack the fort before a relief expedition could arrive  After a heavy bombardment on April 12 13  1861  with no intentional casualties   the fort surrendered  On April 15  Lincoln then called for 75 000 troops from the states to recapture the fort and other federal property  106  Rather than furnish troops and access for an attack on their fellow southern states  Virginia  North Carolina  Tennessee and Arkansas elected to join them in secession  North and South the response to Ft  Sumter was an overwhelming demand for war to uphold national honor  Only Kentucky tried to remain neutral  Hundreds of thousands of young men across the land rushed to enlist  107  Secession begins Jefferson Davis  the only President of the Confederate States of America

Carolina South Carolina did more to advance nullification and secession than any other Southern state  South Carolina adopted the  Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union  on December 24  1860  It argued for states  rights for slave owners in the South  but contained a complaint about states  rights in the North in the form of opposition to the Fugitive Slave Act  claiming that Northern states were not fulfilling their federal obligations under the Constitution  All the alleged violations of the rights of Southern states were related to slavery  Secession winter Before Lincoln took office  seven states had declared their secession from the Union  They established a Southern government  the Confederate States of America on February 4  1861  108  They took control of federal forts and other properties within their boundaries with little resistance from outgoing President James Buchanan  whose term ended on March 4  1861  Buchanan said that the Dred Scott decision was proof that the South had no reason for secession  and that the Union  was intended to be perpetual   but that  the power by force of arms to compel a State to remain in the Union  was not among the  enumerated powers granted to Congress   109  One quarter of the U S  Army the entire garrison in Texas was surrendered in February 1861 to state forces by its commanding general  David E  Twiggs  who then joined the Confederacy  As Southerners resigned their seats in the Senate and the House  Republicans were able to pass bills for projects that had been blocked by Southern Senators before the war  including the Morrill Tariff  land grant colleges  the Morill Act   a Homestead Act  a transcontinental railroad  the Pacific Railway Acts   the National Banking Act and the authorization of United States Notes by the Legal Tender Act of 1862  The Revenue Act of 1861 introduced the income tax to help finance the war  The

Mississippi  Florida  Alabama  Georgia  Louisiana  and Texas  These seven states formed the Confederate States of America  February 4  1861   with Jefferson Davis as president  and a governmental structure closely modeled on the U S  Constitution  Following the attack on Fort Sumter  President Lincoln called for a volunteer army from each state  Within two months  an additional four Southern slave states declared their secession and joined the Confederacy  Virginia  Arkansas  North Carolina and Tennessee  The northwestern portion of Virginia subsequently seceded from Virginia  joining the Union as the new state of West Virginia on June 20  1863  By the end of 1861  Missouri and Kentucky were effectively under Union control  with Confederate state governments in exile  The Union states

Michigan  Minnesota  Missouri  New Hampshire  New Jersey  New York  Ohio  Oregon  Pennsylvania  Rhode Island  Vermont  and Wisconsin  During the war  Nevada and West Virginia joined as new states of the Union  Tennessee and Louisiana were returned to Union military control early in the war  The territories of Colorado  Dakota  Nebraska  Nevada  New Mexico  Utah  and Washington fought on the Union side  Several slave holding Native American tribes supported the Confederacy  giving the Indian Territory  now Oklahoma  a small  bloody civil war  110  111  112  Border states Main article  Border states  American Civil War  The border states in the Union were West Virginia  which separated from Virginia and became a new state   and four of the five northernmost slave states  Maryland  Delaware  Missouri  and Kentucky   Maryland had numerous pro Confederate officials who tolerated anti Union rioting in Baltimore and the burning of bridges  Lincoln responded with martial law and sent in militia units from the North  113  Before the Confederate government realized what was happening  Lincoln had seized firm control of Maryland and the District of Columbia  by arresting all the prominent secessionists and holding them without trial  they were later released   In Missouri  an elected convention on secession voted decisively to remain within the Union  When pro Confederate Governor Claiborne F  Jackson called out the state militia  it was attacked by federal forces under General Nathaniel Lyon  who chased the governor and the rest of the State Guard to the southwestern corner of the state   See also  Missouri secession   In the resulting vacuum  the convention on secession reconvened and took power as the Unionist provisional government of Missouri  114  A Roman Catholic Union army chaplain celebrating a Mass Kentucky did not secede  for a time  it declared itself neutral  When Confederate forces entered the state in September 1861  neutrality ended and the state reaffirmed its Union status  while trying to maintain slavery  During a brief invasion by Confederate forces  Confederate sympathizers organized a secession convention  inaugurated a governor  and gained recognition from the Confederacy  The rebel government soon went into exile and never controlled Kentucky  115  After Virginia s secession  a Unionist government in Wheeling asked 48 counties to vote on an ordinance to create a new state on October 24  1861  A voter turnout of 34  approved the statehood bill  96  approving   116  The inclusion of 24 secessionist counties 117  in the state and the ensuing guerrilla war 118  engaged about 40 000 Federal troops for much of the war  119  Congress admitted West Virginia to the Union on June 20  1863  West Virginia provided about 20 000 22 000 soldiers to both the Confederacy and the Union  120  A Unionist secession attempt occurred in East Tennessee  but was suppressed by the Confederacy  which arrested over 3000 men suspected of being loyal to the Union  They were held without trial  121  Overview Over 10 000 military engagements took place during the war  40  of them in Virginia and Tennessee  122  Since separate articles deal with every major battle and many minor ones  this article only gives the broadest outline  For more information see List of American Civil War battles and Military leadership in the American Civil War  The beginning of the war  1861 For more details on this topic  see Battle of Fort Sumter  Lincoln s victory in the presidential election of 1860 triggered South Carolina s declaration of secession from the Union  By February 1861  an additional six Southern states made similar declarations  On February 7  the seven states adopted a provisional constitution for the Confederate States of America and established their temporary capital at Montgomery  Alabama  A pre war February Peace Conference of 1861 met in Washington in a failed attempt at resolving the crisis  The remaining eight slave states rejected pleas to join the Confederacy  Confederate forces seized most of the federal forts within their boundaries  President Buchanan protested but made no military response apart from a failed attempt to resupply Fort Sumter using the ship Star of the West  which was fired upon by South Carolina forces and turned back before it reached the fort  123  However  governors in Massachusetts  New York  and Pennsylvania quietly began buying weapons and training militia units  The great meeting in Union Square  New York  to support the government  April 20  1861 On March 4  1861  Abraham Lincoln was sworn in as President  In his inaugural address  he argued that the Constitution was a more perfect union than the earlier Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union  that it was a binding contract  and called any secession  legally void   124  He stated he had no intent to invade Southern states  nor did he intend to end slavery where it existed  but that he would use force to maintain possession of federal property  His speech closed with a plea for restoration of the bonds of union  125  The South sent delegations to Washington and offered to pay for the federal properties and enter into a peace treaty with the United States  Lincoln rejected any negotiations with Confederate agents because he claimed the Confederacy was not a legitimate government  and that making any treaty with it would be tantamount to recognition of it as a sovereign government  126  However  Secretary of State William Seward engaged in unauthorized and indirect negotiations that failed  126  Fort Monroe in Virginia  Fort Sumter in Charleston  South Carolina  and Fort Pickens  Fort Jefferson  and Fort Taylor  all in Florida  were the remaining Union held forts in the Confederacy  and Lincoln was determined to hold them all  Under orders from Confederate President Jefferson Davis  troops controlled by the Confederate government under P  G  T  Beauregard bombarded Fort Sumter on April 12  forcing its capitulation  Northerners rallied behind Lincoln s call for all the states to send troops to recapture the forts and to preserve the Union  127  citing presidential powers given by the Militia Acts of 1792  With the scale of the rebellion apparently small so far  Lincoln called for 75 000 volunteers for 90 days  128  For months before that  several Northern governors had discreetly readied their state militias  they began to move forces the next day  129  Confederate sympathizers seized Liberty Arsenal in Liberty  Missouri on April 20  eight days after Fort Sumter  On May 3  1861  Lincoln called for an additional 42 034 volunteers for a period of three years  130  Four states in the upper South  Tennessee  Arkansas  North Carolina  and Virginia   which had repeatedly rejected Confederate overtures  now refused to send forces against their neighbors  declared their secession  and joined the Confederacy  To reward Virginia  the Confederate capital was moved to Richmond  131  The city was the symbol of the Confederacy  Richmond was in a highly vulnerable location at the end of a tortuous Confederate supply line  Although Richmond was heavily fortified  supplies for the city would be reduced by Sherman s capture of Atlanta and cut off almost entirely when Grant besieged Petersburg and its railroads that supplied the Southern capital  Anaconda Plan and blockade  1861 Main article  Union blockade 1861 cartoon of Scott s  Anaconda Plan  Winfield Scott  the commanding general of the U S  Army  devised the Anaconda Plan to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible  132  His idea was that a Union blockade of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy  then the capture of the Mississippi River would split the South  Lincoln adopted the plan in terms of a blockade to squeeze to death the Confederate economy  but overruled Scott s warnings that his new army was not ready for an offensive operation because public opinion demanded an immediate attack  133  In April 1861  Lincoln announced the Union blockade of all Southern ports  commercial ships could not get insurance and regular traffic ended  The South blundered in embargoing cotton exports in 1861 before the blockade was effective  by the time they realized the mistake it was too late   King Cotton  was dead  as the South could export less than 10  of its cotton  134  British investors built small  fast blockade runners that traded arms and luxuries brought in from Bermuda  Cuba and the Bahamas in return for high priced cotton and tobacco  135  When the Union Navy seized a blockade runner  the ship and cargo were sold and the proceeds given to the Navy sailors  the captured crewmen were mostly British and they were simply released  The Southern economy nearly collapsed during the war  Shortages of food and supplies were caused by the blockade  the failure of Southern railroads  the loss of control of the main rivers  foraging by Northern armies  and the impressment of crops by Confederate armies  The standard of living fell even as large scale printing of paper money caused inflation and distrust of the currency  By 1864 the internal food distribution had broken down  leaving cities without enough food and causing bread riots across the Confederacy  136  On March 8  1862  the Confederate Navy waged a fight against the Union Navy when the ironclad CSS Virginia attacked the blockade  Against wooden ships  she seemed unstoppable  The next day  however  she had to fight the new Union warship USS Monitor in the Battle of the Ironclads  137  Their battle ended in a draw  The Confederacy lost the Virginia when the ship was scuttled to prevent capture  and the Union built many copies of Monitor  Lacking the technology to build effective warships  the Confederacy attempted to obtain warships from Britain  Northern technology achieved another breakthrough on April 10 11  1862  when a joint Army Navy expedition reduced a major masonry fortification at Fort Pulaski guarding Savannah  Georgia  Employing the Parrott rifle cannon made masonry coastal defenses obsolete overnight  The Federals left a small garrison  releasing troops and ships for other blockading operations  138  The Union victory at the Second Battle of Fort Fisher in January 1865 closed the last useful Southern port and virtually ended blockade running  Conscription and desertion A Union Regimental Fife and Drum Corps In the first year of the war  both sides had far more volunteers than they could effectively train and equip  After the initial enthusiasm faded  reliance on the cohort of young men who came of age every year and wanted to join was not enough  Both sides used a draft law conscription as a device to encourage or force volunteering  relatively few were actually drafted and served  The Confederacy passed a draft law in April 1862 for young men aged 18 to 35  overseers of slaves  government officials  and clergymen were exempt  139  The U S  Congress followed in July  authorizing a militia draft within a state when it could not meet its quota with volunteers  When the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect in January 1863  ex slaves were energetically recruited by the states  and used to meet the state quotas  States and local communities offered higher and higher cash bonuses for white volunteers  Congress tightened the law in March 1863  Men selected in the draft could provide substitutes or  until mid 1864  pay commutation money  Many eligibles pooled their money to cover the cost of anyone drafted  Families used the substitute provision to select which man should go into the army and which should stay home  There was much evasion and overt resistance to the draft  especially in Catholic areas  The great draft riot in New York City in July 1863 involved Irish immigrants who had been signed up as citizens to swell the machine vote  not realizing it made them liable for the draft  140  Of the 168 649 men procured for the Union through the draft  117 986 were substitutes  leaving only 50 663 who had their personal services conscripted  141  North and South  the draft laws were highly unpopular  An estimated 120 000 men evaded conscription in the North  many of them fleeing to Canada  and another 280 000 Northern soldiers deserted during the war  142  143  along with at least 100 000 Southerners  or about 10  all together  144  However  desertion was a very common event in the 19th century  in the peacetime Army about 15  of the soldiers deserted every year  145  In the South  many men deserted temporarily to take care of their families  146  then returned to their units  147  In the North   bounty jumpers  enlisted to get the generous bonus  deserted  then went back to a second recruiting station under a different name to sign up again for a second bonus  141 were caught and executed  148  Union soldiers in trenches before storming Marye s Heights at the Second Battle of Fredericksburg  Virginia  May 1863  Eastern theater 1861 1863 For more details on this topic  see Eastern Theater of the American Civil War  Because of the fierce resistance of a few initial Confederate forces at Manassas  Virginia  in July 1861  a march by Union troops under the command of Maj  Gen  Irvin McDowell on the Confederate forces there was halted in the First Battle of Bull Run  or First Manassas  149  McDowell s troops were forced back to Washington  D C   by the Confederates under the command of Generals Joseph E  Johnston and P  G  T  Beauregard  It was in this battle that Confederate General Thomas Jackson received the nickname of  Stonewall  because he stood like a stone wall against Union troops  150  Alarmed at the loss  and in an attempt to prevent more slave states from leaving the Union  the U S  Congress passed the Crittenden Johnson Resolution on July 25 of that year  which stated that the war was being fought to preserve the Union and not to end slavery  Maj  Gen  George B  McClellan took command of the Union Army of the Potomac on July 26  he was briefly general in chief of all the Union armies  but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj  Gen  Henry W  Halleck   and the war began in earnest in 1862  Upon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations  McClellan attacked Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the peninsula between the York River and James River  southeast of Richmond  Although McClellan s army reached the gates of Richmond in the Peninsula Campaign  151  152  153 Johnston halted his advance at the Battle of Seven Pines  then General Robert E  Lee and top subordinates James Longstreet and Stonewall Jackson 154  defeated McClellan in the Seven Days Battles and forced his retreat  The Northern Virginia Campaign  which included the Second Battle of Bull Run  ended in yet another victory for the South  155  McClellan resisted General in Chief Halleck s orders to send reinforcements to John Pope s Union Army of Virginia  which made it easier for Lee s Confederates to defeat twice the number of combined enemy troops  Rioters attacking a building on Lexington Avenue during the New York City draft riots of 1863 Emboldened by Second Bull Run  the Confederacy made its first invasion of the North  General Lee led 45 000 men of the Army of Northern Virginia across the Potomac River into Maryland on September 5  Lincoln then restored Pope s troops to McClellan  McClellan and Lee fought at the Battle of Antietam 154  near Sharpsburg  Maryland  on September 17  1862  the bloodiest single day in United States military history  156  Lee s army  checked at last  returned to Virginia before McClellan could destroy it  Antietam is considered a Union victory because it halted Lee s invasion of the North and provided an opportunity for Lincoln to announce his Emancipation Proclamation  157  When the cautious McClellan failed to follow up on Antietam  he was replaced by Maj  Gen  Ambrose Burnside  Burnside was soon defeated at the Battle of Fredericksburg 158  on December 13  1862  when over 12 000 Union soldiers were killed or wounded during repeated futile frontal assaults against Marye s Heights  After the battle  Burnside was replaced by Maj  Gen  Joseph Hooker  Confederate dead behind the stone wall of Marye s Heights  Fredericksburg  Virginia  killed during the Battle of Chancellorsville  May 1863 Hooker  too  proved unable to defeat Lee s army  despite outnumbering the Confederates by more than two to one  he was humiliated in the Battle of Chancellorsville 159  in May 1863  Gen  Stonewall Jackson was mortally wounded by his own men during the battle and subsequently died of complications  Gen  Hooker was replaced by Maj  Gen  George Meade during Lee s second invasion of the North  in June  Meade defeated Lee at the Battle of Gettysburg 160   July 1 to July 3  1863   This was the bloodiest battle of the war  and has been called the war s turning point  Pickett s Charge on July 3 is often considered the high water mark of the Confederacy because it signaled the collapse of serious Confederate threats of victory  Lee s army suffered 28 000 casualties  versus Meade s 23 000   161  However  Lincoln was angry that Meade failed to intercept Lee s retreat  and after Meade s inconclusive fall campaign  Lincoln turned to the Western Theater for new leadership  At the same time the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg surrendered  giving the Union control of the Mississippi River  permanently isolating the western Confederacy  and producing the new leader Lincoln needed  Ulysses S  Grant  Western theater 1861 1863 For more details on this topic  see Western Theater of the American Civil War  While the Confederate forces had numerous successes in the Eastern Theater  they were defeated many times in the West  They were driven from Missouri early in the war as a result of the Battle of Pea Ridge  162 Leonidas Polk s invasion of Columbus  Kentucky ended Kentucky s policy of neutrality and turned that state against the Confederacy  Nashville and central Tennessee fell to the Union early in 1862  leading to attrition of local food supplies and livestock and a breakdown in social organization  The Mississippi was opened to Union traffic to the southern border of Tennessee with the taking of Island No  10 and New Madrid  Missouri  and then Memphis  Tennessee  In April 1862  the Union Navy captured New Orleans 163  without a major fight  which allowed Union forces to begin moving up the Mississippi  Only the fortress city of Vicksburg  Mississippi  prevented Union control of the entire river  General Braxton Bragg s second Confederate invasion of Kentucky ended with a meaningless victory over Maj  Gen  Don Carlos Buell at the Battle of Perryville  164  although Bragg was forced to end his attempt at invading Kentucky and retreat due to lack of support for the Confederacy in that state  Bragg was narrowly defeated by Maj  Gen  William Rosecrans at the Battle of Stones River 165  in Tennessee  The Battle of Chickamauga was one of the deadliest battles in the Western Theater  The one clear Confederate victory in the West was the Battle of Chickamauga  Bragg  reinforced by Lt  Gen  James Longstreet s corps  from Lee s army in the east   defeated Rosecrans  despite the heroic defensive stand of Maj  Gen  George Henry Thomas  Rosecrans retreated to Chattanooga  which Bragg then besieged  The Union s key strategist and tactician in the West was Ulysses S  Grant  who won victories at Forts Henry and Donelson  by which the Union seized control of the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers   the Battle of Shiloh  166  and the Battle of Vicksburg  167  which cemented Union control of the Mississippi River and is considered one of the turning points of the war  Grant marched to the relief of Rosecrans and defeated Bragg at the Third Battle of Chattanooga  168  driving Confederate forces out of Tennessee and opening a route to Atlanta and the heart of the Confederacy  Trans Mississippi theater 1861 1865 For more details on this topic  see Trans Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War  Guerrilla activity turned much of Missouri into a battleground  Missouri had  in total  the third most battles of any state during the war  169  The other states of the west  though geographically isolated from the battles to the east  saw numerous small scale military actions  Battles in the region served to secure Missouri  Indian Territory  and New Mexico Territory for the Union  Confederate incursions into New Mexico territory were repulsed in 1862 and a Union campaign to secure Indian Territory succeeded in 1863  Late in the war  the Union s Red River Campaign was a failure  Texas remained in Confederate hands throughout the war  but was cut off from the rest of the Confederacy after the capture of Vicksburg in 1863 gave the Union control of the Mississippi River  Conquest of Virginia and end of war  1864 1865 The Peacemakers  1868  by George P A  Healy  Aboard the River Queen  March 28  1865  General William T  Sherman  General Ulysses S  Grant  Lincoln  and Admiral David Dixon Porter discuss military plans for final months of the Civil War  At the beginning of 1864  Lincoln made Grant commander of all Union armies  Grant made his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac  and put Maj  Gen  William Tecumseh Sherman in command of most of the western armies  Grant understood the concept of total war and believed  along with Lincoln and Sherman  that only the utter defeat of Confederate forces and their economic base would end the war  170  This was total war not in terms of killing civilians but rather in terms of destroying homes  farms  and railroads  Grant devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the entire Confederacy from multiple directions  Generals George Meade and Benjamin Butler were ordered to move against Lee near Richmond  General Franz Sigel  and later Philip Sheridan  were to attack the Shenandoah Valley  General Sherman was to capture Atlanta and march to the sea  the Atlantic Ocean   Generals George Crook and William W  Averell were to operate against railroad supply lines in West Virginia  and Maj  Gen  Nathaniel P  Banks was to capture Mobile  Alabama  Union forces in the East attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles during that phase   Grant s Overland Campaign   of the Eastern campaign  Grant s battles of attrition at the Wilderness  Spotsylvania  and Cold Harbor 171  resulted in heavy Union losses  but forced Lee s Confederates to fall back repeatedly  An attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler  who was trapped inside the Bermuda Hundred river bend  Grant was tenacious and  despite astonishing losses  over 65 000 casualties in seven weeks   172  kept pressing Lee s Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond  He pinned down the Confederate army in the Siege of Petersburg  where the two armies engaged in trench warfare for over nine months  Generals Sherman  Grant  amp  Sheridan Army Issue of 1937 Grant finally found a commander  General Philip Sheridan  aggressive enough to prevail in the Valley Campaigns of 1864  Sheridan was initially repelled at the Battle of New Market by former U S  Vice President and Confederate Gen  John C  Breckinridge  The Battle of New Market would prove to be the Confederacy s last major victory of the war  After redoubling his efforts  Sheridan defeated Maj  Gen  Jubal A  Early in a series of battles  including a final decisive defeat at the Battle of Cedar Creek  Sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the Shenandoah Valley  173  a strategy similar to the tactics Sherman later employed in Georgia  Confederate dead of General Ewell s Corps who attacked the Union lines at the Battle of Spotsylvania  May 19  1864  Meanwhile  Sherman maneuvered from Chattanooga to Atlanta  defeating Confederate Generals Joseph E  Johnston and John Bell Hood along the way  The fall of Atlanta on September 2  1864  guaranteed the reelection of Lincoln as president  174  Hood left the Atlanta area to swing around and menace Sherman s supply lines and invade Tennessee in the Franklin Nashville Campaign  175  Union Maj  Gen  John Schofield defeated Hood at the Battle of Franklin  and George H  Thomas dealt Hood a massive defeat at the Battle of Nashville  effectively destroying Hood s army  Leaving Atlanta  and his base of supplies  Sherman s army marched with an unknown destination  laying waste to about 20  of the farms in Georgia in his  March to the Sea   He reached the Atlantic Ocean at Savannah  Georgia in December 1864  Sherman s army was followed by thousands of freed slaves  there were no major battles along the March  Sherman turned north through South Carolina and North Carolina to approach the Confederate Virginia lines from the south  176  increasing the pressure on Lee s army  Lee s army  thinned by desertion and casualties  was now much smaller than Grant s  Union forces won a decisive victory at the Battle of Five Forks on April 1  forcing Lee to evacuate Petersburg and Richmond  The Confederate capital fell 177  to the Union XXV Corps  composed of black troops  The remaining Confederate units fled west and after a defeat at Sayler s Creek  it became clear to Robert E  Lee that continued fighting against the United States was both tactically and logistically impossible  Confederacy surrenders Main article  Conclusion of the American Civil War Map of Confederate territory losses year by year Lee surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia on April 9  1865  at the McLean House in the village of Appomattox Court House  178  In an untraditional gesture and as a sign of Grant s respect and anticipation of peacefully restoring Confederate states to the Union  Lee was permitted to keep his sword and his horse  Traveller  On April 14  1865  President Lincoln was shot by John Wilkes Booth  a Southern sympathizer  Lincoln died early the next morning  and Andrew Johnson became president  Meanwhile  Confederate forces across the South surrendered as news of Lee s surrender reached them  179  On June 23  1865  Cherokee leader Stand Watie was the last Confederate general to surrender his forces  180  Emancipation during the war Black and White soldiers in the Union Army  1860s At the beginning of the war  some Union commanders thought they were supposed to return escaped slaves to their masters  By 1862  when it became clear that this would be a long war  the question of what to do about slavery became more general  The Southern economy and military effort depended on slave labor  It began to seem unreasonable to protect slavery while blockading Southern commerce and destroying Southern production  As one Congressman put it  the slaves     cannot be neutral  As laborers  if not as soldiers  they will be allies of the rebels  or of the Union   181  The same Congressman and his fellow Radical Republicans put pressure on Lincoln to rapidly emancipate the slaves  whereas moderate Republicans came to accept gradual  compensated emancipation and colonization  182 Copperheads and some War Democrats opposed emancipation  although the latter eventually accepted it as part of total war needed to save the Union  Many of the recent immigrants in the North viewed freed slaves as competition for scarce jobs  and as the reason why the Civil War was being fought  183  Due in large part to this fierce competition with free blacks for labor opportunities  the poor and working class Irish Catholics generally opposed emancipation  When the draft began in the summer of 1863 they launched a major riot in New York City that was suppressed by the military  as well as much smaller protests in other cities  184  Many Catholics in the North had volunteered to fight in 1861  sending thousands of soldiers to the front and taking high casualties  especially at Fredericksburg  their volunteering fell off after 1862  185  Sentiment among German Americans was largely anti slavery  especially among Forty Eighters  186  Hundreds of thousands of German Americans volunteered to fight for the Union  187  In 1861  Lincoln worried that premature attempts at emancipation would mean the loss of the border states  and that  to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game   188  At first  Lincoln reversed attempts at emancipation by Secretary of War Simon Cameron and Generals John C  Fr mont  in Missouri  and David Hunter  in South Carolina  Georgia and Florida  to keep the loyalty of the border states and the War Democrats  Lincoln warned the border states that a more radical type of emancipation would happen if his gradual plan based on compensated emancipation and voluntary colonization was rejected  189  Only the District of Columbia accepted Lincoln s gradual plan  which was enacted by Congress  When Lincoln told his cabinet about his proposed emancipation proclamation  Seward advised Lincoln to wait for a victory before issuing it  as to do otherwise would seem like  our last shriek on the retreat   190  In September 1862 the Battle of Antietam provided this opportunity  and the subsequent War Governors  Conference added support for the proclamation  191  Lincoln had already published a letter 192  encouraging the border states especially to accept emancipation as necessary to save the Union  Lincoln later said that slavery was  somehow the cause of the war   193  Lincoln issued his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on September 22  1862  and his final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1  1863  In his letter to Hodges  Lincoln explained his belief that  If slavery is not wrong  nothing is wrong     And yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling     I claim not to have controlled events  but confess plainly that events have controlled me   194  Contrabands an escaped slaves who fled to the Union Army for freedom and protection  ca  1862  Since the Emancipation Proclamation was based on the President s war powers  it only included territory held by Confederates at the time  However  the Proclamation became a symbol of the Union s growing commitment to add emancipation to the Union s definition of liberty  195  Lincoln also played a leading role in getting Congress to vote for the Thirteenth Amendment  196  which made emancipation universal and permanent  Enslaved African Americans did not wait for Lincoln s action before escaping and seeking freedom behind Union lines  From early years of the war  hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union lines  especially in occupied areas like Nashville  Norfolk and the Hampton Roads region in 1862  Tennessee from 1862 on  the line of Sherman s march  etc  So many African Americans fled to Union lines that commanders created camps and schools for them  where both adults and children learned to read and write  The American Missionary Association entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps  for instance establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations  In addition  approximately 180 000 or more African American men served as soldiers and sailors with Union troops  Most of those were escaped slaves  Probably the most prominent of these African American soldiers is the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry  Confederates enslaved captured black Union soldiers  and black soldiers especially were shot when trying to surrender at the Fort Pillow Massacre  197  This led to a breakdown of the prisoner and mail exchange program 198  and the growth of prison camps such as Andersonville prison in Georgia  199  where almost 13 000 Union prisoners of war died of starvation and disease  200  Union Army soldier on his release from Andersonville prison in May  1865  After the war  Henry Wirz  the prison s commandant  was tried for war crimes and executed  In spite of the South s shortage of soldiers  most Southern leaders   until 1865   opposed enlisting slaves  They used them as laborers to support the war effort  As Howell Cobb said   If slaves will make good soldiers our whole theory of slavery is wrong   Confederate generals Patrick Cleburne and Robert E  Lee argued in favor of arming blacks late in the war  and Jefferson Davis was eventually persuaded to support plans for arming slaves to avoid military defeat  The Confederacy surrendered at Appomattox before this plan could be implemented  201  Historian John D  Winters  in The Civil War in Louisiana  1963   referred to the exhilaration of the slaves when the Union Army came through Louisiana   As the troops moved up to Alexandria  the Negroes crowded the roadsides to watch the passing army  They were  all frantic with joy  some weeping  some blessing  and some dancing in the exuberance of their emotions   All of the Negroes were attracted by the pageantry and excitement of the army  Others cheered because they anticipated the freedom to plunder and to do as they pleased now that the Federal troops were there   202  The Emancipation Proclamation 203  greatly reduced the Confederacy s hope of getting aid from Britain or France  Lincoln s moderate approach succeeded in getting border states  War Democrats and emancipated slaves fighting on the same side for the Union  The Union controlled border states  Kentucky  Missouri  Maryland  Delaware and West Virginia  were not covered by the Emancipation Proclamation  All abolished slavery on their own  except Kentucky and Delaware  204  The great majority of the 4 million slaves were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation  as Union armies moved south  The 13th amendment  205  ratified December 6  1865  finally made slavery illegal everywhere in the United States  thus freeing the remaining slaves 65 000 in Kentucky  as of 1865   206  1 800 in Delaware  and 18 in New Jersey as of 1860  207  Historian Stephen Oates said that many myths surround Lincoln   man of the people    true Christian    arch villain  and racist  The belief that Lincoln was racist was caused by an incomplete picture of Lincoln  such as focusing on only selective quoting of statements Lincoln made to gain the support of the border states and Northern Democrats  and ignoring the many things he said against slavery  and the military and political context within which such statements were made  Oates said that Lincoln s letter to Horace Greeley has been  persistently misunderstood and misrepresented  for such reasons  208  Blocking international intervention Main articles  Britain in the American Civil War and France in the American Civil War Europe in the 1860s was more fragmented than it had been since before the American Revolution  France was in a weakened state while Britain was still shocked by their poor performance in the Crimean War  209  France was unable or unwilling to support either side without Britain  where popular support remained with the Union though elite opinion was more varied  They were further distracted by Germany and Italy  who were experiencing unification troubles  and by Russia  who was almost unflinching in their support for the Union  209  210  Though the Confederacy hoped that Britain and France would join them against the Union  this was never likely  and so they instead tried to bring Britain and France in as mediators  209  210  The Union  under Lincoln and Secretary of State William H  Seward worked to block this  and threatened war if any country officially recognized the existence of the Confederate States of America  In 1861  Southerners voluntarily embargoed cotton shipments  hoping to start an economic depression in Europe that would force Britain to enter the war in order to get cotton  211  Cotton diplomacy proved a failure as Europe had a surplus of cotton  while the 1860 62 crop failures in Europe made the North s grain exports of critical importance  It also helped to turn European opinion further way from the Confederacy  It was said that  King Corn was more powerful than King Cotton   as U S  grain went from a quarter of the British import trade to almost half  211  When Britain did face a cotton shortage  it was temporary  being replaced by increased cultivation in Egypt and India  Meanwhile  the war created employment for arms makers  ironworkers  and British ships to transport weapons  212  Charles Francis Adams proved particularly adept as minister to Britain for the U S  and Britain was reluctant to boldly challenge the blockade  The Confederacy purchased several warships from commercial ship builders in Britain  The most famous  the CSS Alabama  did considerable damage and led to serious postwar disputes  However  public opinion against slavery created a political liability for European politicians  especially in Britain  who had herself abolished slavery in her own colonies in 1834   213  War loomed in late 1861 between the U S  and Britain over the Trent Affair  involving the U S  Navy s boarding of a British mail steamer to seize two Confederate diplomats  However  London and Washington were able to smooth over the problem after Lincoln released the two  In 1862  the British considered mediation though even such an offer would have risked war with the U S  Lord Palmerston reportedly read Uncle Tom s Cabin three times when deciding on this  213  The Union victory in the Battle of Antietam caused them to delay this decision  The Emancipation Proclamation over time would reinforce the political liability of supporting the Confederacy  Despite sympathy for the Confederacy  France s own seizure of Mexico ultimately deterred them from war with the Union  Confederate offers late in the war to end slavery in return for diplomatic recognition were not seriously considered by London or Paris  After 1863  the Polish revolt against Russia further distracted the European powers  and ensured that they would continue to remain neutral  214  Victory and aftermath Comparison of Union and CSA 215  Union CSA Total population 22

Andersonville National Cemetery is the final resting place for the Union prisoners who perished while being held at Camp Sumter  Historians have debated whether the Confederacy could have won the war  Most scholars  such as James McPherson  argue that Confederate victory was at least possible  216  McPherson argues that the North s advantage in population and resources made Northern victory likely but not guaranteed  He also argues that if the Confederacy had fought using unconventional tactics  they would have more easily been able to hold out long enough to exhaust the Union  217  Confederates did not need to invade and hold enemy territory to win  but only needed to fight a defensive war to convince the North that the cost of winning was too high  The North needed to conquer and hold vast stretches of enemy territory and defeat Confederate armies to win  217  Some scholars  such as those of the Lost Cause tradition  argue that the Union held an insurmountable long term advantage over the Confederacy in terms of industrial strength and population  Confederate actions  they argue  only delayed defeat  Civil War historian Shelby Foote expressed this view succinctly   I think that the North fought that war with one hand behind its back   If there had been more Southern victories  and a lot more  the North simply would have brought that other hand out from behind its back  I don t think the South ever had a chance to win that War   218  The Confederacy sought to win independence by out lasting Lincoln  however  after Atlanta fell and Lincoln defeated McClellan in the election of 1864  all hope for a political victory for the South ended  At that point  Lincoln had succeeded in getting the support of the border states  War Democrats  emancipated slaves  Britain  and France  By defeating the Democrats and McClellan  he also defeated the Copperheads and their peace platform  219  Also important were Lincoln s eloquence in rationalizing the national purpose and his skill in keeping the border states committed to the Union cause  Although Lincoln s approach to emancipation was slow  the Emancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President s war powers  220  The Confederate government failed in its attempt to get Europe involved in the war militarily  particularly the United Kingdom and France  Southern leaders needed to get European powers to help break up the blockade the Union had created around the Southern ports and cities  Lincoln s naval blockade was 95  effective at stopping trade goods  as a result  imports and exports to the South declined significantly  The abundance of European cotton and the United Kingdom s hostility to the institution of slavery  along with Lincoln s Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico naval blockades  severely decreased any chance that either the United Kingdom or France would enter the war  The more industrialized economy of the North aided in the production of arms  munitions and supplies  as well as finances and transportation  The table shows the relative advantage of the Union over the Confederate States of America  CSA  at the start of the war  The advantages widened rapidly during the war  as the Northern economy grew  and Confederate territory shrank and its economy weakened  The Union population was 22 million and the South 9 million in 1861  The Southern population included more than 3 5 million slaves and about 5 5 million whites  thus leaving the South s white population outnumbered by a ratio of more than four to one  221  Collecting bones after the Battle of Cold Harbor  April 1865  The disparity grew as the Union controlled an increasing amount of southern territory with garrisons  and cut off the trans Mississippi part of the Confederacy  The Union at the start controlled over 80  of the shipyards  steamships  riverboats  and the Navy  It augmented these by a massive shipbuilding program  This enabled the Union to control the river systems and to blockade the entire southern coastline  222  Excellent railroad links between Union cities allowed for the quick and cheap movement of troops and supplies  Transportation was much slower and more difficult in the South  which was unable to augment its much smaller rail system  repair damage  or even perform routine maintenance  223  The failure of Davis to maintain positive and productive relationships with state governors  especially Governor Joseph E  Brown of Georgia and Governor Zebulon Baird Vance of North Carolina  damaged his ability to draw on regional resources  224  The Confederacy s  King Cotton  misperception of the world economy led to bad diplomacy  such as the refusal to ship cotton before the blockade started  225  The Emancipation Proclamation enabled African Americans  both free blacks and escaped slaves  to join the Union Army  About 190 000 volunteered  226  further enhancing the numerical advantage the Union armies enjoyed over the Confederates  who did not dare emulate the equivalent manpower source for fear of fundamentally undermining the legitimacy of slavery  Emancipated slaves mostly handled garrison duties  and fought numerous battles in 1864 65  227  European immigrants joined the Union Army in large numbers  including 177 000 born in Germany and 144 000 born in Ireland  228  The railroad industry became the nation s largest employer outside of agriculture  The American Civil War was followed by a boom in railroad construction  which contributed to the Panic of 1873  229  230  Results A double amputee Alfred A  Stratton lost his arms at Petersburg in 1864  Slavery for the Confederacy s 3 5 million blacks effectively ended when Union armies arrived  they were nearly all freed by the Emancipation Proclamation  Slaves in the border states and those located in some former Confederate territory occupied prior to the Emancipation Proclamation were freed by state action or  on December 18  1865  by the Thirteenth Amendment  The full restoration of the Union was the work of a highly contentious postwar era known as Reconstruction  The war produced about 1 030 000 casualties  3  of the population   including about 620 000 soldier deaths two thirds by disease  231  Binghamton University historian J  David Hacker believes the number of soldier deaths was approximately 750 000  20  higher than traditionally estimated  and possibly as high as 850 000  232  233  The war accounted for roughly as many American deaths as all American deaths in other U S  wars combined  234  The causes of the war  the reasons for its outcome  and even the name of the war itself are subjects of lingering contention today  Based on 1860 census figures  8  of all white males aged 13 to 43 died in the war  including 6  in the North and 18  in the South  235  236  About 56 000 soldiers died in prisons during the Civil War  237  An estimated 60 000 men lost limbs in the war  238  One reason for the high number of battle deaths during the war was the use of Napoleonic tactics  such as charging  With the advent of more accurate rifled barrels  Mini  balls and  near the end of the war for the Union army  repeating firearms such as the Spencer repeating rifle  soldiers were mowed down when standing in lines in the open  This led to the adoption of trench warfare  a style of fighting that defined the better part of World War I  The war destroyed much of the wealth that had existed in the South  Income per person in the South dropped to less than 40  than that of the North  a condition which lasted until well into the 20th century  Southern influence in the US federal government  previously considerable  was greatly diminished until the latter half of the 20th century  239  Reconstruction Main article  Reconstruction Era of the United States Reconstruction began during the war  and continued to 1877  in an effort to solve the issues caused by reunion  specifically the legal status of the 11 breakaway states  the Confederate leadership  and the freedmen  Northern leaders during the war agreed that victory would require more than the end of fighting  It had to encompass the two war goals  secession had to be repudiated and all forms of slavery had to be eliminated  Lincoln and the Radical Republicans disagreed sharply on the criteria for these goals  They also disagreed on the degree of federal control that should be imposed on the South  and the process by which Southern states should be reintegrated into the Union  These disputes became central to the political debates after the Confederacy collapsed  Memory and historiography Monument in honor of the Grand Army of the Republic  organized after the war  The Civil War is one of the central events in America s collective memory  There are innumerable statues  commemorations  books and archival collections  The memory includes the home front  military affairs  the treatment of soldiers  both living and dead  in the war s aftermath  depictions of the war in literature and art  evaluations of heroes and villains  and considerations of the moral and political lessons of the war  240  The last theme includes moral evaluations of racism and slavery  heroism in combat and behind the lines  and the issues of democracy and minority rights  as well as the notion of an  Empire of Liberty  influencing the world  241  Memory of the war in the white South crystallized in the myth of the  Lost Cause   which shaped regional identity and race relations for generations  242  150th anniversary The year 2011 included the American Civil War s 150th anniversary  Many in the South are attempting to incorporate both Black history and white perspectives  A Harris Poll given in March 2011 suggested that Americans were still uniquely divided over the results and appropriate memorials to acknowledge the occasion  243  While traditionally American films of the Civil War feature  brother versus brother  themes 244  film treatments of the war are evolving to include African American characters  Benard Simelton  president of the Alabama NAACP  said celebrating the Civil War is like celebrating the  Holocaust   In reference to slavery Simelton said that black  rights were taken away  and that blacks  were treated as less than human beings   National Park historian Bob Sutton said that slavery was the  principal cause  of the war  Sutton also claimed that the issue of state rights was incorporated by the Confederacy as a justification for the war in order to get recognition from Britain  Sutton went on to mention that during the 100th anniversary of the Civil War white southerners focused on the genius of southern generals  rather than slavery  In Virginia during the fall of 2010  a conference took place that addressed the slavery issue  During November 2010  black Civil War reenactors from around the country participated in a parade at Harrisburg  Pennsylvania  245  Hollywood Hollywood s take on the war has been especially
