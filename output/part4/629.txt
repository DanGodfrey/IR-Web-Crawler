American philosophy From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Painting by Howard Chandler Christy of the scene at the Philadelphia Convention which led to the signing of the United States Constitution  an important document in American political and legal philosophy  American philosophy is the philosophical activity or output of Americans  both within the United States and abroad  The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy notes that while American philosophy lacks a  core of defining features  American Philosophy can nevertheless be seen as both reflecting and shaping collective American identity over the history of the nation   1  Contents 1 17th century 2 18th century 2 1 Calvinism 2 2 Age of Enlightenment 3 19th century 3 1 Transcendentalism 3 2 Darwinism in

of the European colonization of the New World  1  The Puritan arrival in New York set the earliest American philosophy into the religious tradition  and there was also an emphasis on the relationship between the individual and the community  This is evident by the early colonial documents such as the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut  1639  and the Massachusetts Body of Liberties  1641   1  Thinkers such as John Winthrop emphasized the public life over the private  holding that the former takes precedence over the latter  while other writers  such as Roger Williams  co founder of Rhode Island  held that religious tolerance was more integral than trying to achieve religious homogeneity in a community  2   edit  18th century See also  18th century philosophy 18th century American philosophy is often broken into two halves  the earlier half being marked by Puritan Calvinism  and the latter characterized by the American incarnation of the European Enlightenment that is associated with the political thought of the Founding Fathers  1   edit  Calvinism Jonathan Edwards is considered to be  America s most important and original philosophical theologian   3  Noted for his energetic sermons  such as  Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God   which is said to have begun the First Great Awakening   Edwards emphasized  the absolute sovereignty of God and the beauty of God s holiness   3  Working to unite Christian Platonism with an empiricist epistemology  with the aid of Newtonian physics  Edwards was deeply influenced by George Berkeley  himself an empiricist  and Edwards derived his importance of the immaterial for the creation human experience from Bishop Berkeley  The non material mind consists of understanding and will  and it is understanding  interpreted in a Newtonian framework  that leads to Edwards  fundamental metaphysical category of Resistance  Whatever features an object may have  it has these properties because the object resists  Resistance itself is the exertion of God s power  and it can be seen in Newton s laws of motion  where an object is  unwilling  to change its current state of motion  an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion  Portrait of Thomas Jefferson by Rembrandt Peale  1800  As a Calvinist and hard determinist  Jonathan Edwards also rejected the freedom of the will  saying that  we can do as we please  but we cannot please as we please   According to Edwards  neither good works nor self originating faith lead to salvation  but rather it is the unconditional grace of God which stands as the sole arbiter of human fortune   edit  Age of Enlightenment While the early 18th century American philosophical tradition was decidedly marked by religious themes  the latter half saw a reliance on reason and science  and  in step with the thought of the Age of Enlightenment  a belief in the perfectibility of human beings  laissez faire economics  and a general focus on political matters  1  Four of the Founding Fathers  John Adams  Thomas Jefferson  Benjamin Franklin  and James Madison  wrote extensively on political issues  In continuing with the chief concerns of the Puritans in the 17th century  the Founding Fathers debated the relationship between the individual and the state  as well as the nature of the state  importantly concerning the state s relationship to God and religion  It was at this time that the United States Declaration of Independence and United States Constitution were written  and they are the result of debate and compromise  The Constitution sets forth a federated republican form of government that is marked by a balance of powers accompanied by a checks and balances system between the three branches of government  a judicial branch  an executive branch led by the President  and a legislative branch composed of a bicameral legislature where the House of Representatives is the lower house and the Senate is the upper house  4  While the Declaration of Independence does contain within it references to the Creator  the Founding Fathers were decidedly not exclusively theistic  some openly professing personal concepts of deism  as was characteristic of other European Enlightenment thinkers  such as Maximilien Robespierre  Fran ois Marie Arouet  better known by his pen name  Voltaire   and Rousseau  5  The most notably and self consciously Christian of the Founding Fathers was John Adams  However  the 1796 Treaty of Tripoli  signed by John Adams  states that  the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion   6  Thomas Paine  the intellectual  pamphleteer  and revolutionary who wrote Common Sense and Rights of Man was an influential Enlightenment thinker and American Founding Father  Common Sense  which has been described as  the most incendiary and popular pamphlet of the entire revolutionary era  7  provides justification for the American revolution and independence from the British Crown   edit  19th century See also  19th century philosophy The 19th century saw the rise of Romanticism in America  The American incarnation of Romanticism was transcendentalism and it stands as a major American innovation  The 19th century also saw the rise of the school of pragmatism  along with a smaller  Hegelian philosophical movement led by George Holmes Howison that was focused in St  Louis  though the influence of American pragmatism far outstripped that of the small Hegelian movement  1  Other reactions to materialism included the  Objective idealism  of Josiah Royce  and the  Personalism   sometimes called  Boston personalism   of Borden Parker Bowne   edit  Transcendentalism Henry David Thoreau  1856 Ralph Waldo Emerson  ca  1857 Transcendentalism in the United States was marked by an emphasis on subjective experience  and can be viewed as a reaction against modernism and intellectualism in general and the mechanistic  reductionistic worldview in particular  Transcendentalism is marked by the holistic belief in an ideal spiritual state that  transcends  the physical and empirical  and this perfect state can only be attained by one s own intuition and personal reflection  as opposed to either industrial progress and scientific advancement or the principles and prescriptions of traditional  organized religion  The most notable transcendentalist writers include Ralph Waldo Emerson  Henry David Thoreau  and Margaret Fuller  8  The transcendentalist writers all desired a deep return to nature  and believed that real  true knowledge is intuitive and personal and arises out of personal immersion and reflection in nature  as opposed to scientific knowledge that is the result of empirical sense experience  9  Things such as scientific tools  political institutions  and the conventional rules of morality as dictated by traditional religion need to be transcended  This is found in Henry David Thoreau s Walden  or  Life in the Woods where transcendence is achieved through immersion in nature and the distancing of oneself from society   edit  Darwinism in America The release of Charles Darwin s evolutionary theory in his 1859 publication of On the Origin of Species had a strong impact on American philosophy  John Fiske and Chauncey Wright both wrote about and argued for the re conceiving of philosophy through an evolutionary lens  They both wanted to understand morality and the mind in Darwinian terms  setting a precedent for evolutionary psychology and evolutionary ethics  Darwin s biological theory was also integrated into the social and political philosophies of English thinker Herbert Spencer and American philosopher William Graham Sumner  Herbert Spencer  who coined the oft misattributed term  survival of the fittest   believed that societies were in a struggle for survival  and that groups within society are where they are because of some level of fitness  This struggle is beneficial to human kind  as in the long run the weak will be weeded out and only the strong will survive  This position is often referred to as Social Darwinism  though it is distinct from the eugenics movements with which social darwinism is often associated  The laissez faire beliefs of Sumner and Spencer do not advocate coercive breeding to achieve a planned outcome  Sumner  much influenced by Spencer  believed along with the industrialist Andrew Carnegie that the social implication of the fact of the struggle for survival is that laissez faire capitalism is the natural political economic system and is the one that will lead to the greatest amount of well being  William Sumner  in addition to his advocacy of free markets  also espoused anti imperialism  having been credited with coining the term  ethnocentrism    and advocated for the gold standard  10   edit  Pragmatism Perhaps the most influential school of thought that is uniquely American is pragmatism  It began in the late nineteenth century in the United States with Charles Sanders Peirce  William James  and John Dewey  Pragmatism begins with the idea that belief is that upon which one is willing to act  It holds that a proposition s meaning is the consequent form of conduct or practice that would be implied by accepting the proposition as true  11   edit  Charles Sanders Peirce Charles Sanders Peirce  an American pragmatist  logician  mathematician  philosopher  and scientist  Polymath  logician  mathematician  philosopher  and scientist Charles Sanders Peirce     p rs  like  purse   1839 1914  coined the term  pragmatism  in the 1870s  12  He was a member of The Metaphysical Club  which was a conversational club of intellectuals that also included Chauncey Wright  future Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes  Jr   and another early figure of pragmatism  William James  11  In addition to making profound contributions to semiotics  logic  and mathematics  Peirce wrote what are considered to be the founding documents of pragmatism   The Fixation of Belief   1877  and  How to Make Our Ideas Clear   1878   In  The Fixation of Belief  Peirce argues for the superiority of the scientific method in settling belief on theoretical questions  In  How to Make Our Ideas Clear  Peirce argued for pragmatism as summed up in that which he later called the pragmatic maxim   Consider what effects  that might conceivably have practical bearings  we conceive the object of our conception to have  Then  our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object   Peirce emphasized that a conception is general  such that its meaning is not a set of actual  definite effects themselves  Instead the conception of an object is equated to a conception of that object s effects to a general extent of their conceivable implications for informed practice  Those conceivable practical implications are the conception s meaning  The maxim is intended to help fruitfully clarify confusions caused  for example  by distinctions that make formal but not practical differences  Traditionally one analyzes an idea into parts  his example  a definition of truth as a sign s correspondence to its object   To that needful but confined step  the maxim adds a further and practice oriented step  his example  a definition of truth as sufficient investigation s destined end   It is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental reflection 13  arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances   a method hospitable to the formation of explanatory hypotheses  and conducive to the use and improvement of verification  14  Typical of Peirce is his concern with inference to explanatory hypotheses as outside the usual foundational alternative between deductivist rationalism and inductivist empiricism  though he himself was a mathematician of logic and a founder of statistics  Peirce s philosophy includes a pervasive three category system  both fallibilism and anti skeptical belief that truth is discoverable and immutable  logic as formal semiotic  including semiotic elements and classes of signs  modes of inference  and methods of inquiry along with pragmatism and critical common sensism   Scholastic realism  theism  objective idealism  and belief in the reality of continuity of space  time  and law  and in the reality of absolute chance  mechanical necessity  and creative love as principles operative in the cosmos and as modes of its evolution   edit  William James William James  an American pragmatist and psychologist  William James  1842 1910  was  an original thinker in and between the disciplines of physiology  psychology and philosophy   15  He is famous as the author of The Varieties of Religious Experience  his monumental tome Principles of Psychology  and his lecture  The Will to Believe   James  along with Peirce  16  saw pragmatism as embodying familiar attitudes elaborated into a radical new philosophical method of clarifying ideas and thereby resolving dilemmas  In his 1910 Pragmatism  A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking  James paraphrased Peirce s pragmatic maxim as follows     T he tangible fact at the root of all our thought distinctions  however subtle  is that there is no one of them so fine as to consist in anything but a possible difference of practice  To attain perfect clearness in our thoughts of an object  then  we need only consider what conceivable effects of a practical kind the object may involve   what sensations we are to expect from it  and what reactions we must prepare    He then went on to characterize pragmatism as promoting not only a method of clarifying ideas but also as endorsing a particular theory of truth  Peirce rejected this latter move by James  preferring to describe the pragmatic maxim only as a maxim of logic and pragmatism as a methodological stance  explicitly denying that it was a substantive doctrine or theory about anything  truth or otherwise  17  James is also known for his radical empiricism which holds that relations between objects are as real as the objects themselves  James was also a pluralist in that he believed that there may actually be multiple correct accounts of truth  He rejected the correspondence theory of truth and instead held that truth involves a belief  facts about the world  other background beliefs  and future consequences of those beliefs  Later in his life James would also come to adopt neutral monism  the view that the ultimate reality is of one kind  and is neither mental nor physical  18   edit  John Dewey John Dewey  1859 1952   while still engaging in the lofty academic philosophical work of James and Peirce before him  also wrote extensively on political and social matters  and his presence in the public sphere was much greater than his pragmatist predecessors  In addition to being one of the founding members of pragmatism  John Dewey was one of the founders of functional psychology and was a leading figure of the progressive movement in U S  schooling during the first half of the 20th century  19  Dewey argued against the individualism of classical liberalism  asserting that social institutions are not  means for obtaining something for individuals  They are means for creating individuals   20  He held that individuals are not things that should be accommodated by social institutions  instead  social institutions are prior to and shape the individuals  These social arrangements are a means of creating individuals and promoting individual freedom  Dewey is well known for his work in the applied philosophy of the philosophy of education  Dewey s philosophy of education is one where children learn by doing  Dewey believed that schooling was unnecessarily long and formal  and that children would be better suited to learn by engaging in real life activities  For example  in math  students could learn by figuring out proportions in cooking or seeing how long it would take to travel distances with certain modes of transportation  21   edit  20th century George Santayana  a Spanish American philosopher  See also  20th century philosophy Pragmatism  which began in the 19th century in America  by the beginning of the 20th century began to be accompanied by other philosophical schools of thought  and was eventually eclipsed by them  though only temporarily  The 20th century saw the emergence of process philosophy  itself influenced by the scientific world view and Einstein s theory of relativity  The middle of the 20th century was witness to the increase in popularity of the philosophy of language and analytic philosophy in America  Existentialism and phenomenology  while very popular in Europe in the 20th century  never achieved the level of popularity in America as they did in continental Europe  1   edit  Rejection of idealism Pragmatism continued its influence into the 20th century  and Spanish born philosopher George Santayana was one of the leading proponents of pragmatism in this period  He held that idealism was an outright contradiction and rejection of common sense  He held that  if something must be certain in order to be knowledge  then it seems no knowledge may be possible  and the result will be skepticism  According to Santayana  knowledge involved a sort of faith  which he termed  animal faith   In his book Scepticism and Animal Faith he asserts that knowledge is not the result of reasoning  Instead  knowledge is what is required to order to act and successfully engage with the world  22  As a naturalist  Santayana was a harsh critic of epistemological foundationalism  The explanation of events in the natural world is within the realm of science  while the meaning and value of this action should be studied by philosophers  Santayana was accompanied in the intellectual climate of  common sense  philosophy by the thinkers of the New Realism movement  such as Ralph Barton Perry   edit  Process philosophy Process philosophy embraces the Einsteinian world view  and its main proponents include Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne  The core belief of process philosophy is the claim that events and processes are principle ontological categories  23  Whitehead asserted in his book The Concept of Nature that the things in nature  what he referred to as  concresences  are a conjunction of events that maintain a permanence of character  Process philosophy is Heraclitan in the sense that a fundamental ontological category is change  24  Charles Hartshorne was also responsible for developing the process philosophy of Whitehead into process theology   edit  Analytic philosophy An image of Quine as seen on his passport  The middle of the 20th century was the beginning of the dominance of analytic philosophy in America  Analytic philosophy  prior to its arrival in America  had begun in Europe with the work of Gottlob Frege  Bertrand Russell  Ludwig Wittgenstein  and the logical positivists  According to logical positivism  the truths of logic and mathematics are tautologies  and those of science are empirically verifiable  Any other claim  including the claims of ethics  aesthetics  theology  metaphysics  and ontology  are meaningless  this theory is called verificationism   With the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party  many positivists fled Germany to Britain and America  and this helped reinforce the dominance of analytic philosophy in the United States in subsequent years  1  W V O  Quine  while not a logical positivist  shared their view that philosophy should stand shoulder to shoulder with science in its pursuit of intellectual clarity and understanding of the world  He criticized the logical positivists and the analytic synthetic distinction of knowledge in his essay  Two Dogmas of Empiricism  and advocated for his  web of belief   which is a coherentist theory of justificiation  In Quine s epistemology  since no experiences occur in isolation  there is actually a holistic approach to knowledge where every belief or experience is intertwined with the whole  Quine is also famous for inventing the term  gavagai  as part of his theory of the indeterminacy of translation  25  Saul Kripke at Juquehy Beach Saul Kripke  a student of Quine at Harvard  has profoundly influenced analytic philosophy  Kripke was ranked among the top ten most important philosophers of the past 200 years in a poll conducted by Brian Leiter  Leiter Reports  a Philosophy Blog  open access poll  26  Kripke is best known for four contributions to philosophy   1  Kripke semantics for modal and related logics  published in several essays beginning while he was still in his teens   2  His 1970 Princeton lectures Naming and Necessity  published in 1972 and 1980   that significantly restructured the philosophy of language and  as some have put it   made metaphysics respectable again    3  His interpretation of the philosophy of Wittgenstein  27   4  His theory of truth  He has also made important contributions to set theory  see admissible ordinal and Kripke Platek set theory  David Kellogg Lewis  another student of Quine at Harvard  was ranked as one of the greatest philosophers of the 20th century in a poll conducted by Brian Leiter  open access poll   28  He is well known for his controversial advocacy of modal realism  the position which holds that there is an infinite number of concrete and causally isolated possible worlds  of which ours is one  29  These possible worlds arise in the field of modal logic  Thomas Kuhn was an important philosopher and writer who worked extensively in the fields of the history of science and the philosophy of science  He is famous for writing The Structure of Scientific Revolutions  one of the most cited academic works of all time  The book argues that science proceeds through different paradigms as scientists find new puzzles to solve  There follows a widespread struggle to find answers to questions  and a shift in world views occurs  which is referred to by Kuhn as a paradigm shift  30  The work is considered a milestone in the sociology of knowledge   edit  Return to political philosophy The analytic philosophers troubled themselves with the abstract and the conceptual  and American philosophy did not fully return to social and political concerns  that dominated American philosophy at the time of the founding of the United States  until the 1970s  The return to political and social concerns included the popularity of works of Ayn Rand  who promoted Ethical egoism  which she called Objectivism  in her novels  The Fountainhead in 1943 and Atlas Shrugged in 1957  These two novels gave birth to the Objectivist movement  one which started as a small group of students called The Collective  one of whom was a young Alan Greenspan  the well known libertarian Chairman of the Federal Reserve  31  Objectivism holds that there is an objective external reality that can be known with reason  that human beings should act in accordance with their own rational self interest  and that the proper form of economic organization is laissez faire capitalism  32  Academic philosophers have been highly critical of the quality and intellectual rigor of Rand s work  33  34  but she remains a popular  albeit controversial  figure within the American libertarian movement  35  36  In 1971 John Rawls published his book A Theory of Justice  The book puts forth Rawls  view of justice as fairness  one which is based on a form of social contract theory  Rawls employs the use of a conceptual mechanism called the veil of ignorance to outline his idea of the original position  37  In Rawls  philosophy  the original position is the correlate to the Hobbesian state of nature  While in the original position  persons are said to be behind the veil of ignorance  which makes these persons unaware of their individual characteristics and their place in society  such as their race  religion  wealth  etc  The principles of justice are chosen by rational persons while in this original position  The two principles of justice are the equal liberty principle and the principle which governs the distribution of social and economic inequalities  From this  Rawls argues for a system of distributive justice in accordance with the Difference Principle  which says that all social and economic inequalities must be to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged  38  Viewing Rawls as promoting excessive government control and rights violations  libertarian Robert Nozick published Anarchy  State  and Utopia in 1974  The book advocates for a minimal state and defends the liberty of the individual  He argues that the role of government should be limited to  police protection  national defense  and the administration of courts of law  with all other tasks commonly performed by modern governments   education  social insurance  welfare  and so forth   taken over by religious bodies  charities  and other private institutions operating in a free market   39  Nozick asserts his view of the entitlement theory of justice  which says that if everyone in society has acquired their holdings in accordance with the principles of acquisition  transfer  and rectification  then any pattern of allocation  no matter how unequal the distribution may be  is just  The entitlement theory of justice holds that the  justice of a distribution is indeed determined by certain historical circumstances  contrary to end state theories   but it has nothing to do with fitting any pattern guaranteeing that those who worked the hardest or are most deserving have the most shares   40  Alasdair MacIntyre  while he was born and educated in the United Kingdom  has spent around forty years living and working in the United States  He is responsible for the resurgence of interest in virtue ethics  a moral theory first propounded by the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle  41  42  He is considered the preeminent Thomist political philosopher  He holds that  modern philosophy and modern life are characterized by the absence of any coherent moral code  and that the vast majority of individuals living in this world lack a meaningful sense of purpose in their lives and also lack any genuine community   43  He recommends a return to genuine political communities where individuals can properly acquire their virtues  Outside academic philosophy  political and social concerns took center stage with the Civil Rights Movement and the writings of Martin Luther King  Jr   edit  Feminism Betty Friedan See also  History of feminism While there were earlier writers who would be considered feminist  such as Sarah Grimk   Charlotte Perkins Gilman  Elizabeth Cady Stanton  and Anne Hutchinson  the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s  also known as second wave feminism  is notable for its impact in philosophy  44  The popular mind was taken with Betty Friedan s The Feminine Mystique  This was accompanied by other feminist philosophers  such as Adrienne Rich  These philosophers critiqued basic assumptions and values of philosophy  such as objectivity and what they believe to be masculine approaches to ethics  for example  rights based political theories  They wrote that there is no such thing as a value neutral inquiry and they sought to analyze the social dimensions of philosophical issues   edit  Contemporary philosophy Hilary Putnam Towards the end of the 20th century there was a resurgence of interest in pragmatism  Largely responsible for this are Hilary Putnam and Richard Rorty  Rorty is famous as the author of Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature and Philosophy and Social Hope  Hilary Putnam is well known for his quasi empiricism in mathematics  45  his challenge of the brain in a vat thought experiment  46  and his other work in philosophy of mind  philosophy of language  and philosophy of science  The debates that occur within the philosophy of mind have taken center stage  American philosophers such as Hilary Putnam  Donald Davidson  47 Daniel Dennett  48 Douglas Hofstadter  49 John Searle  50  as well as Patricia and Paul Churchland 51  continue the discussion of such issues as the nature of mind and the hard problem of consciousness  a philosophical problem indicated by the Australian philosopher David Chalmers  52  Noted American legal philosophers Ronald Dworkin and Richard Posner work in the fields of political philosophy and jurisprudence  Posner is famous for his economic analysis of law  a theory which uses microeconomics to understand legal rules and institutions  53  Dworkin is famous for his theory of law as integrity and legal interpretivism  54  55  African American philosopher Cornel West is known for his analysis of American cultural life with regards to race  gender  and class issues  as well as his associations with pragmatism and transcendentalism  Alvin Plantinga is a Christian thinker known for his evolutionary argument against naturalism  his assertion that one can know God as a properly basic belief  and his modal version of the ontological argument for the existence of God  Michael C  Rea has developed Plantinga s thought by claiming that both naturalism and supernaturalism are research programmes that have to be adopted as a basis for research  56   edit  See also History of philosophy Lists  List of American philosophers List of African American philosophers List of
