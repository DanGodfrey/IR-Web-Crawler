Main article  Colonial American military history The beginning of the United States military lies in civilian frontier settlers  armed for hunting and basic survival in the wilderness  These were organized into local militias for small military operations  mostly against Native American tribes but also to resist possible raids by the small military forces of neighboring European colonies  They relied on the British regular army and navy for any serious military operation  4  In major operations outside the locality involved  the militia was not employed as a fighting force  Instead the colony asked for  and paid  volunteers  many of whom were also militia members  5  Siege of Louisbourg  1758  In the early years of the British colonization of North America  military action in the thirteen colonies that would become the United States were the result of conflicts with Native Americans  such as in the Pequot War of 1637  King Philip s War in 1675  the Yamasee War in 1715 and Father Rale s War in 1722  Beginning in 1689  the colonies became involved in a series of wars between Great Britain and France for control of North America  the most important of which were Queen Anne s War  in which the British conquered French colony Acadia  and the final French and Indian War  1754 1763  when Britain was victorious over all the French colonies in North America  This final war was to give thousands of colonists  including Virginia colonel George Washington  military experience which they put to use during the American Revolution  6   edit  War of Independence  1775 1783  Main article  American Revolutionary War Detail from Washington and his Generals at Yorktown  c  1781  by Charles Willson Peale  Lafayette  far left  is at Washington s right  the Comte de Rochambeau to his immediate left  Ongoing political tensions between Great Britain and the thirteen colonies reached a crisis in 1774 when the British placed the province of Massachusetts under martial law after the Patriots protested illegal taxes  While shooting began at Lexington and Concord in 1775  the Continental Congress appointed George Washington as commander in chief of the newly created Continental Army  which was augmented throughout the war by colonial militia  General Washington was not the greatest battlefield tactician  but his overall strategy proved to be sound  keep the army intact  wear down British resolve  and avoid decisive battles except to exploit enemy mistakes  7  Washington s surprise crossing of the Delaware River in Dec  1776 was a major comeback after the loss of New York City  his army defeated the British in two battles and recaptured New Jersey  The British  for their part  lacked both a unified command and a clear strategy for winning  With the use of the Royal Navy  the British were able to capture coastal cities  but control of the countryside eluded them  A British invasion from Canada in 1777 ended with the disastrous surrender of a British army at Saratoga  With the coming in 1777 of General von Steuben  the training and discipline along Prussian lines began  and the Continental Army became a modern force  France and Spain then entered the war against Great Britain  ending its naval advantage and creating a world war  A shift in focus to the southern American states resulted in a string of victories for the British  but guerrilla warfare and the tenacity of General Nathanael Greene s army prevented the British from making strategic headway  The main British army was surrounded by Washington s American and French forces at Yorktown in 1781  as the French fleet blocked a rescue by the Royal Navy  The American victory forced the British to sue for peace  General George Washington  1732 1799  proved an excellent organizer and administrator  who worked successfully with Congress and the state governors  selecting and mentoring his senior officers  supporting and training his troops  and maintaining an idealistic Republican Army  His biggest challenge was logistics  since neither Congress nor the states had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment  munitions  clothing  paychecks  or even the food supply of the soldiers  As a battlefield tactician Washington was often outmaneuvered by his British counterparts  As a strategist  however  he had a better idea of how to win the war than they did  The British sent four invasion armies  Washington s strategy forced the first army out of Boston in 1776  and was responsible for the surrender of the second and third armies at Saratoga  1777  and Yorktown  1781   He limited the British control to New York and a few places while keeping Patriot control of the great majority of the population  The Loyalists  on whom the British had relied too heavily  comprised about 20  of the population but never were well organized  As the war ended  Washington watched proudly as the final British army quietly sailed out of New York City in November 1783  taking the Loyalist leadership with them  Washington astonished the world when  instead of seizing power  he retired quietly to his farm in Virginia  8  Since many Americans of the revolutionary generation had strong distrust of permanent  or  standing   armies  the Continental Army was quickly disbanded after the Revolution  General Washington  who throughout the war deferred to elected officials  averted a potential crisis and resigned as commander in chief to Congress after the war  establishing a tradition of civil control of the U S  military  9   edit  Early national period  1783 1812  Main articles  Northwest Indian War  Quasi War  Barbary Wars  Tecumseh s War  and Creek War Following the American Revolution  the United States faced potential military conflict on the high seas as well as on the western frontier  The United States was a minor military power during this time  having only a modest army and navy  A traditional distrust of standing armies  combined with faith in the abilities of local militia  precluded the development of well trained units and a professional officer corps  Jeffersonian leaders preferred a small army and navy  fearing that a large military establishment would involve the United States in excessive foreign wars  and potentially allow a domestic tyrant to seize power  10  Stephen Decatur boarding the Tripolitan gunboat  3 August 1804  the First Barbary War  In the Treaty of Paris after the Revolution  the British had ceded the lands between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River to the United States  without consulting the Shawnee  Cherokee  Choctaw and other smaller tribes who lived there  Because many of the tribes had fought as allies of the British  the United States compelled tribal leaders to sign away lands in postwar treaties  and began dividing these lands for settlement  This provoked a war in the Northwest Territory in which the U S  forces performed poorly  the Battle of the Wabash in 1791 was the most severe defeat ever suffered by the United States at the hands of American Indians  President Washington dispatched a newly trained army to the region  which decisively defeated the Indian confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794  11  When revolutionary France declared war on Great Britain in 1793  the United States sought to remain neutral  but the Jay Treaty  which was favorable to Great Britain  angered the French government  which viewed it as a violation of the 1778 Treaty of Alliance  French privateers began to seize U S  vessels  which led to an undeclared  Quasi War  between the two nations  Fought at sea from 1798 to 1800  the United States won a string of victories in the Caribbean  George Washington was called out of retirement to head a  provisional army  in case of invasion by France  but President John Adams managed to negotiate a truce  in which France agreed to terminate the prior alliance and cease its attacks  12   edit  Barbary wars The Berbers along the Barbary Coast  modern day Libya  sent pirates to capture merchant ships and hold the crews for ransom  The U S  paid protection money until 1801  when President Thomas Jefferson refused to pay and sent in the Navy to challenge the Barbary States  the First Barbary War followed  After the U S S  Philadelphia was captured in 1803  Lieutenant Stephen Decatur led a raid which successfully burned the captured ship  preventing Tripoli from using or selling it  In 1805  after William Eaton captured the city of Derna  Tripoli agreed to a peace treaty  The other Barbary states continued to raid U S  shipping  until the Second Barbary War in 1815 ended the practice  13   We have met the enemy and they are ours   Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry s victory on Lake Erie in 1813 was an important turning point in the War of 1812   Painting by William H  Powell  1865   edit  War of 1812 Main article  War of 1812 By far the largest military action in which the United States engaged during this era was the War of 1812  When the United Kingdom and France went to war again in 1803 with renewed vigor  the United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade  This proved difficult  and the United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812  the first time the U S  had officially declared war  Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy  the U S  attacked the British Empire by invading British Canada  hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip  The invasion of Canada was a debacle  though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front  Tecumseh s War and the Creek War  were more successful  After defeating Napoleon in 1814  Britain sent large veteran armies to invade New York  raid Washington and capture the key control of the Mississippi River at New Orleans  The New York invasion was a fiasco after the much larger British army retreated to Canada  The raiders succeeded in burning of Washington on 25 August 1814  but were repulsed in their Chesapeake Bay Campaign at the Battle of Baltimore and the British commander killed  The major invasion in Louisiana was stopped by a one sided military battle that killed the top three British generals and thousands of soldiers  The winners were the commanding general of the Battle of New Orleans  Major General Andrew Jackson  who became president and the Americans who basked in a victory over a much more powerful nation  The peace treaty proved successful  and the U S  and Canada never again went to war  The losers were the Indians  who never gained the independent territory in the Midwest promised by Britain  14   edit  War with Mexico  1846 48  Main article  Mexican American War American forces storming the  Halls of Montezuma  With the rapid expansion of the farming population  Democrats looked to the west for new lands  an idea which became known as  Manifest Destiny   In the Texas Revolution  1835 36   the settlers declared independence and defeated the Mexican army  but Mexico was determined to reconquer the lost province and threatened war with the U S  if it annexed Texas  The U S   much larger and more powerful  did annex Texas in 1845 and war broke out in 1846 over boundary issues  15  16  In the Mexican American War 1846 48  the U S  Army under Generals Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott and others  invaded and after a series of victorious battles  and no major defeats  seized New Mexico and California  and also blockaded the coast  invaded northern Mexico  and invaded central Mexico  capturing the national capital  The peace terms involved American purchase of the area from California to New Mexico for  10 million  17   edit  American Civil War  1861 1865  Main article  American Civil War Dead soldiers lie where they fell at Antietam  the bloodiest day in American history  Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation after this battle  Sectional tensions had long existed between the states located north of the Mason Dixon Line and those south of it  primarily centered on the  peculiar institution  of slavery and the ability of states to overrule the decisions of the national government  During the 1840s and 1850s  conflicts between the two sides became progressively more violent  After the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860  who southerners thought would work to end slavery  states in the South seceded from the United States  beginning with South Carolina in late 1860  On April 12  1861  forces of the South  known as the Confederate States of America or simply the Confederacy  opened fire on Fort Sumter  whose garrison was loyal to the Union  18  The American Civil War caught both sides unprepared  The Confederacy hoped to win by getting Britain and France to intervene  or else by wearing down the North s willingness to fight  The U S  sought a quick victory focused on capturing the Confederate capital at Richmond  Virginia  The Confederates under Robert E  Lee tenaciously defended their capital until the very end  The war spilled across the continent  and even to the high seas  Most of the material and personnel of the South were used up  while the North prospered  The American Civil War is sometimes called the  first modern war  due to the mobilization  and destruction  of the civilian base  It also is characterized by many technical innovations involving railroads  telegraphs  rifles  trench warfare  and ironclad warships with turret guns  19   edit  Post Civil War era  1865 1917   edit  Indian Wars  1865 1891  Main article  Indian Wars After the Civil War  population expansion  railroad construction  and the disappearance of the buffalo herds heightened military tensions on the Great Plains  Several tribes  especially the Sioux and Comanche  fiercely resisted confinement to reservations  The main role of the Army was to keep indigenous peoples on reservations and to end their wars against settlers and each other  William Tecumseh Sherman and Philip Sheridan were in charge  A famous victory for the Plains Nations was the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876  when Col  George Armstrong Custer and two hundred plus members of the 7th Cavalry were killed by a force consisting of Native Americans from the Lakota  Northern Cheyenne  and Arapaho nations  The last significant conflict came in 1891  20   edit  Spanish American War  1898  Main article  Spanish American War Charge by the Rough Riders The Spanish American War was a short decisive war marked by quick  overwhelming American victories at sea and on land against Spain  The Navy was well prepared and won laurels  even as politicians tried  and failed  to have it redeployed to defend East Coast cities against potential threats from the feeble Spanish fleet  21  The Army performed well in combat in Cuba  However  it was too oriented to small posts in the West and not as well prepared for an overseas conflict  22  It relied on volunteers and state militia units  which faced logistical  training and food problems in the staging areas in Florida  23  The United States freed Cuba  after an occupation by the U S  Army   By the peace treaty Spain ceded to the United States its colonies of Puerto Rico  Guam  and the Philippines  24  The Navy set up coaling stations there and in Hawaii  which voluntarily joined the U S  in 1898   The U S  Navy now had a major forward presence across the Pacific and  with the lease of Guant namo Bay Naval Base in Cuba  a major base in the Caribbean guarding the approaches to the Gulf Coast and the Panama Canal  25   edit  Philippine American War  1899 1902  Main article  Philippine American War The Philippine American War  1899 1902  was an armed conflict between a group of Filipino revolutionaries and the American forces following the ceding of the Philippines to the United States after the defeat of Spanish forces in the Battle of Manila  The Army sent in 100 000 soldiers  mostly from the National Guard  under General Elwell Otis  Defeated in the field and losing its capital in March 1899  the poorly armed and poorly led rebels broke into armed bands  The insurgency collapsed in March 1901 when the leader Emilio Aguinaldo was captured by General Frederick Funston and his Macabebe allies  Casualties included 1037 Americans killed in action and 3340 who died from disease  20 000 rebels were killed  26   edit  Modernization The Navy was modernized in the 1880s  and by the 1890s had adopted the naval power strategy of Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan  as indeed did every major navy  The old sailing ships were replaced by modern steel battleships  bringing them in line with the navies of Britain and Germany  In 1907  most of the Navy s battleships  with several support vessels  dubbed the Great White Fleet  were featured in a 14 month circumnavigation of the world  Ordered by President Theodore Roosevelt  it was a mission designed to demonstrate the Navy s capability to extend to the global theater  27  Secretary of War Elihu Root  1899 1904  led the modernization of the Army  His goal of a uniformed chief of staff as general manager and a European type general staff for planning was stymied by General Nelson A  Miles but did succeed in enlarging West Point and establishing the U S  Army War College as well as the General Staff  Root changed the procedures for promotions and organized schools for the special branches of the service  He also devised the principle of rotating officers from staff to line  Root was concerned about the Army s role in governing the new territories acquired in 1898 and worked out the procedures for turning Cuba over to the Cubans  and wrote the charter of government for the Philippines  28  Rear Admiral Bradley A  Fiske was at the vanguard of new technology in naval guns and gunnery  thanks to his innovations in fire control 1890 1910  He immediately grasped the potential for air power  and called for the development of a torpedo plane  Fiske  as aide for operations in 1913 15 to Assistant Secretary Franklin D  Roosevelt  proposed a radical reorganization of the Navy to make it a war fighting instrument  Fiske wanted to centralize authority in a chief of naval operations and an expert staff that would develop new strategies  oversee the construction of a larger fleet  coordinate war planning including force structure  mobilization plans  and industrial base  and insure that the US Navy possessed the best possible war machines  Eventually  the Navy adopted his reforms and by 1915 started to reorganize for possible involvement in the World War then underway  29   edit  Banana Wars  1898 1935  Main article  Banana Wars  Banana Wars  is an informal term for the minor intervention in Latin America from 1898 until 1934  These include military presence in Cuba  Panama with the Panama Canal Zone  Haiti  1915 1935   Dominican Republic  1916 1924  and Nicaragua  1912 1925   amp   1926 1933   The U S  Marine Corps began to specialize in long term military occupation of these countries  primarily to safeguard customs revenues which were the cause of local civil wars  30   edit  Moro Rebellion  1899 1913  Main article  Moro Rebellion The Moro Rebellion was an armed insurgency between Muslim Filipino tribes in the southern Philippines between 1899 and 1913  Pacification was never complete as sporadic antigovernment insurgency continues into the 21st century  with American advisors helping the Philippine government forces  31   edit  Mexico  1910 1919  Main article  Border War  1910 1919  U S  enters Mexico in 1916 to punish Pancho Villa The Mexican Revolution involved a civil war with hundreds of thousands of deaths and large numbers fleeing combat zones  Tens of thousands fled to the U S  President Wilson sent U S  forces to occupy the Mexican city of Veracruz for six months in 1914  It was designed to show the U S  was keenly interested in the civil war and would not tolerate attacks on Americans  especially the April 9  1914   Tampico Affair   which involved the arrest of American sailors by soldiers of the regime of Mexican President Victoriano Huerta  32  In early 1916 Pancho Villa a Mexican general ordered 500 soldiers on a murderous raid on the American city of Columbus New Mexico  with the goal of robbing banks to fund his army  33  The German Secret Service encouraged Pancho Villa in his attacks to involve the United States in an intervention in Mexico which would distract the United States from its growing involvement in the war and divert aid from Europe to support the intervention  34  Wilson called up the state militias  National Guard  and sent them and the U S  Army under General John J  Pershing to punish Villa in the Pancho Villa Expedition  Villa fled  with the Americans in pursuit deep into Mexico  thereby arousing Mexican nationalism  By early 1917 President Venustiano Carranza had contained Villa and secured the border  so Wilson ordered Pershing to withdraw  35  36   edit  World War I  1917 1918  Main articles  American entry into World War I and American Expeditionary Forces 69th Infantry Regiment parading upon returning to New York City The United States originally wished to remain neutral when World War I broke out in August 1914  However  it insisted on its right as a neutral party to immunity from German submarine attack  The ships carried food and raw materials to Britain  In 1917 the Germans resumed submarine attacks  knowing that it would lead to American entry  However the U S  had deliberately kept its army small and mobilization took a year  Meanwhile the U S  sent more supplies and money to Britain and France  and started the first peacetime draft  37  Economic mobilization was much slower than expected  so the decision was made to send divisions to Europe without their equipment  relying instead on British and French supplies  38  By summer 1918  a million American soldiers  or  doughboys  as they were often called  of the American Expeditionary Force were in Europe under the command of John J  Pershing  with 25 000 more arriving every week  The failure of Germany s spring offensive meant it had exhausted its manpower reserves and were unable to launch attacks or even defend its lines  Meanwhile  the German home front revolted and a new German government signed a conditional surrender  the Armistice  ending the war on November 11  1918  39   edit  Russian Revolution The so called Polar Bear Expedition was the involvement of U S  troops  during the tail end of World War I and the Russian Revolution  in blocking the Bolsheviks in Arkhangelsk  Russia in 1918 and 1919   edit  1920s  Naval disarmament Main article  Washington Naval Conference The U S  sponsored a major world conference to limit the naval armaments of world powers  including the U S   Britain  Japan  and France  plus smaller nations  40  Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes made the key proposal of each country to reduce its number of warships by a formula that was accepted  The conference enabled the great powers to reduce their navies and avoid conflict in the Pacific  The treaties remained in effect for ten years  but were not renewed as tensions escalated  41   edit  1930s  Neutrality Acts After the costly U S  involvement in World War I  isolationism grew within the nation  Congress refused membership in the League of Nations  and in response to the growing turmoil in Europe and Asia  the gradually more restrictive Neutrality Acts were passed  which were intended to prevent the U S  from supporting either side in a war  President Franklin D  Roosevelt sought to support Britain  however  and in 1940 signed the Lend Lease Act  which permitted an expansion of the  cash and carry  arms trade to develop with Britain  which controlled the Atlantic sea lanes  Roosevelt favored the Navy  he was in effective charge in World War I   and used relief programs such as the PWA to support Navy yards and build warships  For example in 1933 he authorized  238 million in PWA funds for thirty two new ships  The Army Air Corps received only  11 million  which barely covered replacements and allowed no expansion  42   edit  World War II  1939 1945  Main article  Military history of the United States during World War II See also  Military history of the Philippines during World War II  Air warfare of World War II United States  The U S  Air Force  and Special relationship During the interwar period the United States again reduced its military  but mobilized to its largest levels in history during World War II  The global conflict started on 1 September 1939 and raged until 2 September 1945  involving most of the peoples of the world  It was the most extensive and costly war in history as well as the history of the United States  excepting personnel   US involvement in World War II was initially limited to providing war material and financial support to Britain  the Soviet Union  and the Republic of China  The US entered officially on 8 December 1941 following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor  Hawaii the previous day  This attack was followed by attacks on US  Dutch and British possessions across the Pacific  On 11 December  the remaining Axis powers  Germany and Italy  declared war on the US  drawing the US firmly into the war and removing all doubts about the global nature of the conflict  Explosion aboard USS Arizona during the Attack on Pearl Harbor  The loss of 8 battleships and 2000 sailors and airmen at Pearl Harbor forced the US to rely on its remaining aircraft carriers  which won a major victory over Japan at Midway just 6 months into the war  and its growing submarine fleet  The Navy and Marine Corps followed this up with an island hopping campaign across the central and South Pacific in 1943 45  reaching the outskirts of Japan in the Battle of Okinawa  During 1942 and 1943  the US deployed millions of men and thousands of planes and tanks to the UK  beginning with the strategic bombing of Nazi Germany and occupied Europe and leading up to the Allied invasions of occupied North Africa in November 1942  Sicily and Italy in 1943  France in 1944  and the invasion of Germany in 1945  parallel with the Soviet invasion from the east  That led to the surrender of Nazi Germany in May 1945  In the Pacific  the US experienced much success in naval campaigns during 1944  but bloody battles at Iwo Jima and Okinawa in 1945 led the US to look for a way to end the war with minimal loss of American lives  The U S  used atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to shock the Japanese leadership  which  combined with the Soviet invasion of Manchuria  quickly caused the surrender of Japan  The United States was able to mobilize quickly  eventually becoming the dominant military power in most theaters of the war  excepting only eastern Europe   and the industrial might of the US economy became a major factor in the Allies  mobilization of resources  Strategic and tactical lessons learned by the US  such as the importance of air superiority and the dominance of the aircraft carrier in naval actions  continue to guide US military doctrine more than 65 years later  General of the Army MacArthur signs on behalf of the Allies  World War II holds a special place in the American psyche as the country s greatest triumph  and the soldiers of World War II are frequently referred to as  the greatest generation  for their sacrifices in the name of liberty  Over 16 million served  about 11  of the population   and over 400 000 died during the war  The U S  emerged as one of the two undisputed superpowers along with the Soviet Union  and unlike the Soviet Union  the US homeland was virtually untouched by the ravages of war  During and following World War II  the United States and Britain developed an increasingly strong  if one sided  defence and intelligence relationship  Manifestations of this include extensive basing of US forces in the UK  shared intelligence  shared military technology  e g  nuclear technology  and shared procurement  Further information  List of United States Army divisions during World War II  edit  Cold War era  1945 1991  Main article  Cold War Following World War II  the United States emerged as a global superpower vis a vis the Soviet Union in the Cold War  In this period of some forty years  the United States provided foreign military aid and direct involvement in proxy wars against the Soviet Union  It was the principal foreign actor in the Korean War and Vietnam War during this era  Nuclear weapons were held in ready by the United States under a concept of mutually assured destruction with the Soviet Union   edit  Postwar Military Reorganization  1947  The National Security Act of 1947  meeting the need for a military reorganization to complement the U S  superpower role  combined and replaced the former Department of the Navy and War Department with a single cabinet level Department of Defense  The act also created the National Security Council  the Central Intelligence Agency  and the Air Force   edit  Korean War  1950 1953  Main article  Korean War Beachhead at Inchon The Korean War was a conflict between the United States and its United Nations allies and the communist powers under influence of the Soviet Union  also a UN member nation  and the People s Republic of China  which later also gained UN membership   The principal combatants were North and South Korea  Principal allies of South Korea included the United States  Canada  Australia  the United Kingdom  although many other nations sent troops under the aegis of the United Nations  Allies of North Korea included the People s Republic of China  which supplied military forces  and the Soviet Union  which supplied combat advisors and aircraft pilots  as well as arms  for the Chinese and North Korean troops  43  The war started badly for the US and UN  North Korean forces struck massively in the summer of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered US and ROK defenders into the sea  However the United Nations intervened  naming Douglas MacArthur commander of its forces  and UN US ROK forces held a perimeter around Pusan  gaining time for reinforcement  MacArthur  in a bold but risky move  ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at Inchon  cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea  As UN forces continued to advance toward the Yalu River on the border with Communist China  the Chinese crossed the Yalu River in October and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel  Truman originally wanted a Rollback strategy to unify Korea  after the Chinese successes he settled for a Containment policy to split the country  44  MacArthur argued for rollback but was fired  Peace negotiations dragged on for two years until President Dwight D  Eisenhower threatened China with nuclear weapons  an armistice was quickly reached with the two Koreas remaining divided at the 38th parallel  North and South Korea are still today in a state of war  having never signed a peace treaty  and American forces remain stationed in South Korea as part of American foreign policy  45   edit  Lebanon crisis of 1958 In the

article  Vietnam War See also  United States Air Force in Thailand and Secret War The Vietnam War was a war fought between 1957 and 1975 on the ground in South Vietnam and bordering areas of Cambodia and Laos  see Secret War  and in the strategic bombing  see Operation Rolling Thunder  of North Vietnam  American advisors came in the late 1950s to help the RVN  Republic of Vietnam  combat Communist insurgents known as  Viet Cong   Major American military involvement began in 1964  after Congress provided President Lyndon B  Johnson with blanket approval for presidential use of force in the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution  Fighting on one side was a coalition of forces including the Republic of Vietnam  South Vietnam or the  RVN    the United States  supplemented by South Korea  Thailand  Australia  New Zealand  and the Philippines  The allies fought against the North Vietnamese Army  NVA  as well as the National Liberation Front  NLF  also known as Viet communists Viet Cong   or  VC   a guerrilla force within South Vietnam  The NVA received substantial military and economic aid from the Soviet Union and China  turning Vietnam into a proxy war  United States Embassy following the Tet Offensive  The U S  framed the war as part of its policy of containment of Communism in south Asia  but American forces were frustrated by an inability to engage the enemy in decisive battles  corruption and incompetence in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam  and ever increasing protests at home  The Tet Offensive in 1968  although a major military defeat for the NLF with half their forces eliminated  marked the psychological turning point in the war  With President Richard M  Nixon opposed to containment and more interested in achieving d tente with both the Soviet Union and China  American policy shifted to  Vietnamization     providing very large supplies of arms and letting the Vietnamese fight it out themselves  After more than 57 000 dead and many more wounded  American forces withdrew in 1973 with no clear victory  and in 1975 South Vietnam was finally conquered by communist North Vietnam and unified  46  Memories and lessons from the war are still a major factor in American politics  One side views the war as a necessary part of the Containment policy  which allowed the enemy to choose the time and place of warfare  Others note the U S  made major strategic gains as the Communists were defeated in Indonesia  and by 1972 both Moscow and Beijing were competing for American support  at the expense of their allies in Hanoi  Critics see the conflict as a  quagmire   an endless waste of American blood and treasure in a conflict that did not concern US interests  Fears of another quagmire have been major factors in foreign policy debates ever since  47  The draft became extremely unpopular  and President Nixon ended it in 1973  48  forcing the military  the Army especially  to rely entirely upon volunteers  That raised the issue of how well the professional military reflected overall American society and values  the soldiers typically took the position that their service represented the highest and best American values  49   edit  Tehran hostage rescue During and Iran hostage crisis  Operation Eagle Claw was an attempt to rescue the hostages  It failed because of inappropriate equipment  incomplete and unrealistic planning  and the lack of joint service training  The fiasco led directly to the creation of SOCOM   edit  Grenada In October  1983  a violent power struggle threatened American lives in the small Caribbean nation of Grenada  Neighboring nations asked the U S  to intervene  The invasion was a hurriedly devised grouping of paratroopers  Marines  Rangers  and special operations forces in Operation Urgent Fury  Over a thousand Americans quickly seized the entire island  taking hundreds of military and civilian prisoners  especially Cubans  50  51   edit  Beirut In 1983 fighting between Palestinian refugees and Lebanese factions reignited that nation s long running civil war  A UN agreement brought an international force of peacekeepers to occupy Beirut and guarantee security  US Marines landed in August 1982 along with Italian and French forces  On October 23  1983  a suicide bomber driving a truck filled with 6 tons of TNT crashed through a fence and destroyed the Marine barracks  killing 241 Marines  seconds later  a second bomber leveled a French barracks  killing 58  Subsequently the US Navy engaged in bombing of militia positions inside Lebanon  While US President Ronald Reagan was initially defiant  political pressure at home eventually forced the withdrawal of the Marines in February 1984  The attack on the US Marine barracks resulted in the single largest loss of life for the USMC since World War II  citation needed  In 2003  a judge for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the Islamic Republic of Iran was responsible for the attack  52   edit  Libya Main article  Bombing of Libya  1986  Code named  Operation El Dorado Canyon   comprised the joint United States Air Force  Navy and Marine Corps air strikes against Libya on April 15  1986  The attack was carried out in response to the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing   edit  Panama On December 20  1989 the United States invaded Panama  mainly from U S  bases within the then Canal Zone  to oust dictator and international drug trafficker Manuel Noriega  American forces quickly overwhelmed the Panamanian Defense Forces  Noriega was captured on January 3  1990 and imprisoned in the U S  and a new government was installed  53   edit  Post Cold War era  1991 2001  US military engagements 1990 2002  edit  Persian Gulf War  1990 1991  The Persian Gulf War was a conflict between Iraq and a coalition force of 34 nations led by the United States  The lead up to the war began with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 which was met with immediate economic sanctions by the United Nations against Iraq  The coalition commenced hostilities in January 1991  resulting in a decisive victory for the U S  led coalition forces  which drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait with minimal coalition deaths  Despite the low death toll  over 180 000 US veterans would later be classified as  permanently disabled  according to the US Department of Veterans Affairs  National Gulf War Resource Center  see also Gulf War Syndrome   The main battles were aerial and ground combat within Iraq  Kuwait and bordering areas of Saudi Arabia  Land combat did not expand outside of the immediate Iraq Kuwait Saudi border region  although the coalition bombed cities and strategic targets across Iraq  and Iraq fired missiles on Israeli and Saudi cities  54  USS Wisconsin fires on Iraqi positions in Kuwait  Before the war  many observers believed the US and its allies could win but might suffer substantial casualties  certainly more than any conflict since Vietnam   and that the tank battles across the harsh desert might rival those of North Africa during World War II  After nearly 50 years of proxy wars  and constant fears of another war in Europe between NATO and the Warsaw Pact  some thought the Persian Gulf War might finally answer the question of which military philosophy would have reigned supreme  Iraqi forces were battle hardened after 8 years of war with Iran  and they were well equipped with late model Soviet tanks and jet fighters  but the antiaircraft weapons were crippled  in comparison  the US had no large scale combat experience since its withdrawal from Vietnam nearly 20 years earlier  and major changes in US doctrine  equipment and technology since then had never been tested under fire  However  the battle was one sided almost from the beginning  The reasons for this are the subject of continuing study by military strategists and academics  There is general agreement that US technological superiority was a crucial factor but the speed and scale of the Iraqi collapse has also been attributed to poor strategic and tactical leadership and low morale among Iraqi troops  which resulted from a history of incompetent leadership  After devastating initial strikes against Iraqi air defenses and command and control facilities on 17 January 1991  coalition forces achieved total air superiority almost immediately  The Iraqi air force was destroyed within a few days  with some planes fleeing to Iran where they were interned for the duration of the conflict  The overwhelming technological advantages of the US  such as stealth aircraft and infrared sights  quickly turned the air war into a  turkey shoot   The heat signature of any tank which started its engine made an easy target  Air defense radars were quickly destroyed by radar seeking missiles fired from wild weasel aircraft  Grainy video clips  shot from the nose cameras of missiles as they aimed at impossibly small targets  were a staple of US news coverage and revealed to the world a new kind of war  compared by some to a video game  Over 6 weeks of relentless pounding by planes and helicopters  the Iraqi army was almost completely beaten but did not retreat  under orders from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein  and by the time the ground forces invaded on 24 February  many Iraqi troops quickly surrendered to forces much smaller than their own  in one instance  Iraqi forces attempted to surrender to a television camera crew that was advancing with coalition forces  After just 100 hours of ground combat  and with all of Kuwait and much of southern Iraq under coalition control  US President George H  W  Bush ordered a cease fire and negotiations began resulting in an agreement for cessation of hostilities  Some US politicians were disappointed by this move  believing Bush should have pressed on to Baghdad and removed Hussein from power  there is little doubt that coalition forces could have accomplished this if they had desired  Still  the political ramifications of removing Hussein would have broadened the scope of the conflict greatly  and many coalition nations refused to participate in such an action  believing it would create a power vacuum and destabilize the region  55  Following the Persian Gulf War  to protect minority populations  the US  Britain  and France declared and maintained no fly zones in northern and southern Iraq  which the Iraqi military frequently tested  The no fly zones persisted until the 2003 invasion of Iraq  although France withdrew from participation in patrolling the no fly zones in 1996  citing a lack of humanitarian purpose for the operation   edit  Somalia Main articles  Operation Restore Hope and UNOSOM II US troops participated in a UN peacekeeping mission in Somalia beginning in 1992  By 1993 the US troops were augmented with Rangers and special forces with the aim of capturing warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid  whose forces had massacred peacekeepers from Pakistan  During a raid in downtown Mogadishu  US troops became trapped overnight by a general uprising in the Battle of Mogadishu  Eighteen American soldiers were killed  and a US television crew filmed graphic images of the body of one soldier being dragged through the streets by an angry mob  Somali guerrillas paid a staggering toll at an estimated 1 000 5 000 total casualties during the conflict  After much public disapproval  American forces were quickly withdrawn by President Bill Clinton  The incident profoundly affected US thinking about peacekeeping and intervention  The book Black Hawk Down was written about the battle  and was the basis for the later movie of the same name  56   edit  Haiti Main article  Operation Uphold Democracy Operation Uphold Democracy  September 19  1994   March 31  1995  was an intervention designed to remove the military regime installed by the 1991 Haitian coup d  tat  which overthrew the elected President Jean Bertrand Aristide  The operation was effectively authorized by the 31 July 1994 United Nations Security Council Resolution 940  57   edit  Yugoslavia During the war in Yugoslavia in the early 1990s  the US operated in Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of the NATO led multinational implementation force  IFOR  in Operation Joint Endeavour   The USA was one of the NATO member countries who bombed Yugoslavia between March 24 and June 9  1999 during the Kosovo War and later contributed to the multinational force KFOR  58   edit  War on Terrorism  2001 present  The War on Terrorism is a global effort by the governments of several countries  primarily the United States and its principal allies  to neutralize international terrorist groups  primarily radical Islamist terrorist groups  including al Qaeda  and ensure that rogue nations no longer support terrorist activities  It has been adopted as a response to the September 11  2001 attacks on the United States   edit  Afghanistan Special Forces soldiers on horseback in November 2001 The invasion of Afghanistan  Operation Enduring Freedom   Afghanistan  to depose that country s Taliban government and destroy training camps associated with al Qaida is understood to have been the opening  and in many ways defining  campaign of the broader War on Terrorism  The emphasis on Special Operations Forces  SOF   political negotiation with autonomous military units  and the use of proxy militaries marked a significant change from prior U S  military approaches  59   edit  Philippines In January 2002  the U S  sent more than 1 200 troops  later raised to 2 000  to assist the Armed Forces of the Philippines in combating terrorist groups linked to al Qaida  such as Abu Sayyaf  under Operation Enduring Freedom   Philippines  Operations are taking place mostly in the Sulu Archipelago  where terrorists and other groups are active  The majority of troops provide logistics  however  many are Special Forces troops that are training and assisting in combat operations against the terrorist groups   edit  Iraq A Marine Corps M1 Abrams tank patrols a Baghdad street in April 2003  Main articles  2003 invasion of Iraq and Post invasion Iraq  2003 present After the lengthy Iraq disarmament crisis culminated with an American demand that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein leave Iraq  which was refused  a coalition led by the United States and the United Kingdom fought the Iraqi army in the 2003 invasion of Iraq  Approximately 250 000 United States troops  with support from 45 000 British  2 000 Australian and 200 Polish combat forces  entered Iraq primarily through their staging area in Kuwait   Turkey had refused to permit its territory to be used for an invasion from the north   Coalition forces also supported Iraqi Kurdish militia  estimated to number upwards of 50 000  After approximately three weeks of fighting  Hussein and the Ba ath Party were forcibly removed  followed by 9 years of military occupation by the United States   edit  Libyan intervention Main article  Operation Odyssey Dawn As a result of the Libyan civil war  the United Nations enacted United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973  which imposed a no fly zone over Libya  and the protection of civilians from the forces of Muammar Gaddafi  The United States  along with Britain  France and several other nations  committed a coalition force against Gaddafi s forces  On 19 March  the first U S  action was taken when 114 Tomahawk missiles launched by US and UK warships destroyed shoreline air defenses of the Gaddafi regime  60  The U S  continued to play a major role in Operation Unified Protector  the NATO directed mission that eventually incorporated all of the military coalition s actions in the theater  Throughout the conflict however  the U S  maintained it was playing a supporting role only and was following the UN mandate to protect civilians  while the real conflict was between Gaddafi s loyalists and Libyan rebels fighting to depose him  61  During the conflict  American drones were also deployed  62   edit  See also United States Armed Forces History of the United States Army National Museum of the United States Army History of the United States Marine Corps
