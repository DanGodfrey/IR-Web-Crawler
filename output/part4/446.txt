Force  IMF   a small team of secret agents used for covert missions against dictators  evil organizations  and  primarily in later episodes  crime lords  On occasion  the IMF also mounts unsanctioned  private missions on behalf of its members  The identities of the organization that oversees the IMF and the government it works for are never revealed  Only rare cryptic bits of information are ever provided during the life of the series  such as in the third season mission  Nicole   where the IMF leader states that his instructions come from  Division Seven   In the 1980s revival  it is suggested the IMF is an independent agency  as the FBI can only legally operate within the United States and the CIA can only operate outside the country   In the first motion picture  unlike the TV show  the IMF is depicted as part of the CIA   edit  IMF agents Steven Hill as Dan Briggs and Martin Landau as Rollin Hand in the show premiere  September 17  1966  The leader of the IMF is initially Dan Briggs  played by Steven Hill  As an Orthodox Jew  Hill had to leave on Fridays at 4 p m  to be home before sundown and was not available until sundown the next day  Although his contract allowed for filming interruptions due to religious observances  the clause proved difficult to work around due to the production schedule and as the season progressed  an increasing number of episodes featured little of Dan Briggs  Hill had other problems as well  After cooperatively crawling through dirt tunnels and repeatedly climbing a rope ladder in the episode  Snowball in Hell   in the following episode   Action    he balked at climbing a stairway with railings and locked himself in his dressing room  Unable to come to terms with Hill  the producers re shot the episode without him  another character  Cinnamon Carter  listened to the taped message  the selected operatives  photos were displayed in  limbo   and the team meeting was held in Rollin Hand s apartment   and reduced Briggs  presence in the five episodes left to be filmed to a minimum  1  As far as Hill s religious requirements were concerned  line producer Joseph Gantman simply had not understood what had been agreed to  He told author Patrick J  White    If someone understands your problems and says he understands them  you feel better about it  But if he doesn t care about your problems  then you begin to really resent him  Steven Hill may have felt exactly the same way   2  Hill was replaced without explanation to the audience after the first season by Peter Graves playing the role of Jim Phelps  who remained the leader for the remainder of the original series and in the 1988 1990 revival  Barbara Bain as Cinnamon Carter  1969  In theory  Briggs and Phelps are the only full time members of the IMF  As the series was originally conceived  they would form teams made up of part time agents who came from a variety of professions  choosing their operatives based on the particular skills necessary for the mission  In practice  however  especially after the first season   Briggs and especially Phelps would choose the same core group of three or four agents for every single mission  leading these regulars to be considered de facto full time IMF agents  Still  many episodes also feature guest stars playing one time additional agents who have special abilities  The regular agent line up during the first season consisted of  Cinnamon Carter  Barbara Bain   a top fashion model and actress Barnard  Barney  Collier  Greg Morris   a mechanical and electronics genius and owner of Collier Electronics William  Willy  Armitage  Peter Lupus   a world record holding weight lifter Rollin Hand  Martin Landau   a noted actor  makeup artist  escape artist  magician and  master of disguise  The 1970 cast from left  Leonard Nimoy  Greg Morris  Lesley Ann Warren  Peter Lupus  and Peter Graves  Landau was billed as a  special guest star  during the first season  he had been cast as a guest star for the pilot with the understanding that he would be one of four or five rotating guest star agents  His contract gave producers an option to have him  render services for  three or four  additional episodes   To fill the void left by Hill s Sabbath absences  producers wound up using Landau for more episodes  always as a  guest star   He eventually struck a deal to appear in all the first season s remaining episodes  but always billed as a  guest star  so that he could have the option to give notice to work on a feature film  Landau contractually became a series regular in season two  3  As actors left the series over time  others became regulars  Replacements often possessed the same skills of their predecessors  For example   The Great Paris   Leonard Nimoy   Hand s replacement in the fourth and fifth seasons  was also an actor  make up artist  magician and  master of disguise   Also seen in seasons five and six was Dr  Doug Robert  played by Sam Elliott  Cinnamon s  replacement  in season four was a series of guest stars  only one making more than one appearance  Lee Meriwether as Tracey  Season five saw the addition of Dana Lambert  played by stage and movie actress Lesley Ann Warren  who was billed as  Lesley Warren  during her tenure in the cast  In seasons six and seven  the female member of the team was cosmetologist Lisa Casey  Lynda Day George   replaced during most of George s season seven maternity leave by Mimi Davis  played by Barbara Anderson  who had just come from the show Ironside   who in practical terms was another Cinnamon Carter replacement  4  Morris and Lupus were the only actors to last through the full run of the original series  Morris also appeared in two episodes of the revival series  in which the character s son  Grant Collier  played by Morris s real life son  Phil Morris   is also an IMF agent   edit  Cold War subtext Although a Cold War subtext is present throughout the series  the actual Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union is rarely mentioned over the course of the series   See  for example  the mission objectives for  The Trial  and  The Confession  in Season One   However  in the early years  specific locations behind the Iron Curtain are named  such as Lubyanka prison in the episode  Memory   and many of the targets appear to be leaders of fictional Slavic countries  Major named enemy countries include the  European People s Republic  and the  Eastern European Republic   Additionally  real languages spoken in East Europe are used  In the Season One episode  The Carriers   one of the villains reads a book whose title is the  incorrect  Russian Na Voina  About War   police vehicles are often labelled as such with words such as  pol i ia   and  p   ia   and a gas line or tank would be labelled  Gaz  which is a Romanian translation  This  language   referred to by the production team as  Gellerese   was invented specifically to be readable by non speakers of Slavic languages  Their generous use of it was actually intended as a source of comic relief  Uniforms of the target regime frequently include peaked caps  jackboots  and Sam Browne belts  hinting at connections with Nazi Germany or the Warsaw Pact  In 2004  Professor Douglas Little of Clark University published a lengthy academic article explicitly linking the TV series to CIA history   Mission Impossible  The CIA and the Cult of Covert Action in the Middle East   5   edit  Adversaries unrelated to the Cold War The IMF is also assigned to bring down corrupt politicians and dictators of Third World countries uninvolved in the Cold War  such as a particularly brutal practitioner of apartheid  or corrupt Central or South American nations  as well as organized crime figures  corrupt businessmen and politicians in the U S  In two different first season episodes  the mission is to stop the revival of the Nazi Party in Germany  Both episodes had Rollin Hand  played by Jewish actor Martin Landau  impersonate a leading Nazi figure   Martin Bormann in one case   in a successful effort to stop the revival  In season two  Hand would successfully impersonate Adolf Hitler in another mission to stop the revival of the Nazi Party in Germany  As noted in the reference work The Complete  Mission  Impossible  Dossier  by Patrick J  White  many IMF missions were essentially assassinations in disguise  In the first season episode  Memory   it is established that the unspecified government agency behind the IMF has forbidden it to commit outright assassinations  as a matter of policy   To get around this restriction  many missions instead involve the IMF setting up its targets to be killed by their own people or other enemies  A notable example is the second season two part story  The Council   later released to European movie houses under the title Mission Impossible vs  the Mob  6  This policy is not consistently followed  for example  in the first season s  The Legend   Briggs  original plan is to personally shoot Nazi rallying figure Martin Bormann  which is foiled by the discovery of a dummy and a tape recorder in the  man s  sick room  Gunplay is relatively rare on the part of the IMF  as its methods are more sophisticated and subtle like those used by con men to fleece the gullible  although several episodes in the early seasons  for example  the second season episode  The Spy   as well as in the pilot episode  do show the agents shooting people when necessary  usually underlings or enemy soldiers    edit  Fifth season During the fifth season  with Paramount executives having gained greater control  new producer Bruce Lansbury began to phase out the international missions  This would manifest itself the following year with the IMF battling organized crime in most episodes  though this season still featured more international forays than not  These gangland bosses are usually associated with a criminal organization called  The Syndicate   a generic organization  or its franchises  Generally when describing such assignments  the tape message notes that the target is outside the reach of  conventional law enforcement   The objectives of such missions is usually simply to obtain evidence that might be admissible in court  often taking the form of tricking the mobsters into making a confession while being recorded  Manipulating the targets into killing one another became much less frequent as well  Lansbury also attempted to replace Peter Lupus  who was expressing dissatisfaction with his part at this time  with Sam Elliott  Over the course of the fifth season  Lupus s William  Willy  Armitage appeared in thirteen of its twenty four episodes  to the outrage of fans who demanded Armitage s return  7  By the end of the fifth season  Elliott was gone  he did appear in the first filmed episode of season six 8    and Lupus remained in the last two seasons  with Armitage being given a larger share of screen time and more demanding duties   edit  Format This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Mission  Impossible is noted for its format  which rarely changed throughout the series  Indeed the opening scenes acquired a ritualistic feel  befitting the  quasi official  aura the program sought for the clandestine operations it showcases   edit  Tape scene Most episodes begin with the leader of the IMF getting the assignment from a hidden tape recorder and an envelope of photos and information that explains the mission  The tape always begins with  Good morning afternoon evening  Mr  Briggs Phelps   Then it explains the situation and ends with  Your mission Dan Jim  should you decide to accept it  or words to that effect  with a brief explanation of the mission  The listener is reminded   As always  should you or any of your I M  Force be caught or killed  the Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions    9  The instructions on the tape were read by voice actor Robert Cleveland  Bob  Johnson  At the end of the tape s instructions  Phelps Briggs is notified   This tape will self destruct in five  or  occasionally  ten  seconds  Good luck  Dan Jim   Then smoke would rise from the tape  and the instructions would be destroyed  In filming  the tapes were not actually destroyed  Instead  smoke was piped into the tape recorder to create the illusion  In some initial episodes  however  self destructing tapes were created by adding a chemical to the tape and blowing air onto it  forcing the chemical to react by crumbling  This method was abandoned due to cost  10  There were a few exceptions to the use of a tape and standard photos  including a record darkroom motif and most notably a vintage phonograph that automatically scratched its record into oblivion  In a few instances  instructions at the end of the tape would ask Briggs Phelps   Please dispose of  or  sometimes  destroy  this recording in the usual manner   Briggs Phelps would then throw it in an incinerator or use other means to render it unplayable  causing the tape to go up in flames  There were a handful of exceptions to the  messages from the Secretary   Instead  circumstances more or less forced a team into action  This first occurred in the program s opening season  when a  syndicate  boss kidnapped and threatened to kill the teenage daughter of a friend of Briggs unless he removed a grand jury witness against the mobster from police protective custody  How this man knew Dan was capable of such a task was not explained  11  The last such instance was very near the end of the series  when the survivors of a previous IMF operation  specifically  Season Six s  Casino   recognized a vacationing Phelps from security camera photos and kidnapped him to force his team to retrieve evidence that a plea bargaining mobster is about to turn over to authorities  12  In the fifth season  the producers experimented with the format by sometimes eliminating the taped briefing  and or the team meeting in Phelps  apartment   starting the episode with the mission already underway  In a few other cases  a personal matter involving Briggs  Phelps or another IMF operative would result in an  off book  mission being undertaken  After the first year  an entire season s worth of  tape scenes  were usually filmed all at once prior to production of the rest of the episodes  and the crew never knew which tape scene would appear with which episode until broadcast  13  Some tape scenes were re used in more than one episode  with only minor changes to various insert shots and Johnson s recorded voiceover  In the first season  for example  the exact same tape scene was used for both  Wheels  and  Legacy   The only differences are that The Voice On Tape gives a different set of instructions in each episode  and there is very briefly a different set of insert shots that show the photographs which Dan Briggs is viewing  The cost saving practice of recycling tape scenes continued throughout the series run  generally each season reuses at least one tape scene  One particular tape scene  of Jim finding a tape in a parking lot attendant s hut  was actually used in three widely scattered episodes   The Astrologer    Recovery  and  The Vault    edit  Dossier scene Next would follow what White refers to as the  Dossier Scene   Briggs or Phelps would be shown in a fancy apartment  retrieving an oversized  leather bound dossier folder from a locked drawer  Inside this folder were plastic wrapped dossiers  usually featuring standard 8x10  glossies  of the respective actors  of the available IMF agents  Briggs Phelps would toss the selected agents  dossiers onto a table  According to White  most of the never chosen dossiers were photographs of various series staffers and their wives  including Mr  and Mrs  Bruce Geller  the author reproduces one oft rejected agent s photo and identifies it as actually being the executive producer 14    A contemporary article in TV Guide volume  amp  issue needed  claimed that many of the photos put aside in the  dossier scene  were of studio and network executives and that it was considered a measure of one s status in the studio and network hierarchies to appear there  but White makes no such statement  In early seasons  the agents selected often included guest stars playing agents with skills not possessed by the usual team  A doctor  particularly a specialist in a condition known to afflict the target  was a common sort of  guest agent   In numerous early episodes  the IMF leader would choose only two or three team members  though at least one of the main credited cast members was always involved  One episode   Elena   featured a team consisting of Rollin Hand and Dr  Carlos Enero  guest star Barry Atwater   15  because of Landau s official status at that point as frequent guest star this meant that technically none of the series  regular players was involved  Almost as often  however  Briggs would choose all of the regulars  plus one  two  or even three others  In later seasons  the team was much more stable  consisting of the leader and the regular cast for the season  and the use of guest agents became markedly less frequent  Numerous dossier scenes from the Peter Graves episodes feature Jim poring through the photographs  only to once again choose the series regulars that had just been shown in the opening credits  By the third season  the dossier scene had been deemed somewhat disposable  appearing only when needed to introduce a guest agent  The first mission submitted by the Secretary that did not have the dossier scene was the last mission of the second season   The Recovery   After a period of being seen only occasionally  the dossier scene was seen again frequently in season 4  due to the lack of a regular female team member in that season  It was dropped entirely as of season five  In the pilot episode  the recorded message stated that the team leaders have unlimited resources and wide discretion in choosing their team  Who devises the plan is never made clear  Preparations and the necessary logistics are almost never shown  although they are generally implied by the scenes that depict various steps of the mission  It is implied that only a short period of time elapses from the initial assignment until the team is in the field  Early episodes occasionally showed more of the preliminaries   Memory  features a montage of Dan Briggs training a guest agent to assume the role he will play in the mission   Old Man Out  Part 1  includes a scene of Briggs approaching an operative  played by Mary Ann Mobley  in order to recruit her  meeting with resistance before he finally convinces her to join the mission   edit  Apartment scene In the third segment of the opening act  called the  Apartment Scene  by White  the team would next be shown convening for their final briefing in the leader s apartment  Although the series was shot in color  the apartment had a color scheme composed of black  white  and shades of gray  such that the apartment was sometimes referred to off camera as the black and white room  Steven Hill once suggested that an American flag be placed on a wall of Briggs  apartment  but Bruce Geller vetoed it  in order to maintain the color scheme 16    Two exceptions are the first season episodes   Operation Rogosh   when the team immediately springs into action to capture their target in a staged auto accident  and the aforementioned episode  Action    where the team meeting took place in Cinnamon Carter s apartment  17  The Apartment Scene acted as a teaser  In discussing the plan and their roles in it  the team members would make vague references to preparations necessary for its successful execution while leaving most details undisclosed  This scene also demonstrated and thereby established credibility for various gadgets or ploys that were key to the plan  such as a TV camera hidden in a brooch  a miniature radio controlled hovercraft  a chess playing computer  a  mentalist  or sleight of hand act  or a trained animal  In addition  this scene would establish  or at least hint at  the specialties and roles of any guest star agents  Team members posing questions about aspects of the plan or why an alternative was not considered provided the writers with an opportunity to offer explanations for what otherwise might have seemed plot holes  When summing up  Phelps would often stress the difficulties in the action they were about to undertake or some key element of the plan vital to its success  such as a deadline by which the mission had to be completed  During the fifth season  the producers decided to drop the dossier scene and phase out the tape and apartment scenes  By the end of the season  however  it had been decided to keep the tape and apartment scenes  but the dossier choosing scene was eliminated for the rest of the series run  this is White s version  but in fact episodes missing the tape and or the meeting scenes were few   The 1980s revival reinstated the  dossier scene  in the first episode  when Phelps selected his new team  but since he kept the same team in subsequent episodes  no subsequent dossier scenes were made   edit  Plan The episode then depicted the plan being put into action  This almost always involved very elaborate deceptions  usually several at the same time  Facilitating this  certain team members were masters of disguise  able to impersonate someone connected to the target or sometimes even the target himself  This was accomplished with realistic latex face masks and make up  Some impersonations were done with the explicit cooperation of the one being impersonated  Also bona fides would be arranged to aid infiltrating the target organization  In some cases  the actor playing the IMF agent also portrayed the person to be impersonated  this most frequently occurred during Martin Landau s tenure on the series  beginning in the pilot  or the voice of the person being impersonated was dubbed  In other cases  a guest starring actor would play the dual role of both the original and the imposter  Rollin  Paris  or Casey   Sometimes one or more IMF team members would allow themselves to be captured in order to gain more access to or knowledge of the organization they are infiltrating  either by conversing with the target or being held in a jail cell and hatching their plan there  A few episodes of the early seasons showed the painstaking creation and application of these masks  usually by disguise and make up expert Rollin Hand  This was later omitted as the series progressed and the audience presumably becoming familiar with the mechanics of the team s methods  In the 1980s revival  the mask making process involved a digital camera and computer and was mostly automatic  Most episodes included a dramatic  reveal   also referred to as the  peel off   near the end of the episode in which the team member would remove the mask  Various other technological methods were commonly used as well  The team would often re route telephone or radio calls so these could be answered by their own members  Faked radio or television broadcasts were common  as were elevators placed under the team s control  In some missions  a very extensive simulated setting was created  such as a faked train journey  submarine voyage  aftermath of a major disaster  or even the taking over of the United States by a foreign government  A particularly elaborate ploy  used on more than one occasion  saw the IMF working to convince their target that several years had passed while the target was in a coma or similar condition  In one episode  the IMF even convinced their target  an aging mobster played by William Shatner  that time had somehow been turned back more than thirty years and he was a young man again  The team would usually arrange for some situation to arise with which the target would have to deal in a predictable way  and the team would then arrange the circumstances to guide the outcome to the desired end  Often the plans turned on elaborate psychology  such as exploiting rivalries or an interest in the supernatural  Many plans simply caused the target to become confused or erratic or irrational  lose self assurance  lose trust in subordinates or partners  etc   so that either the target would do what the team wanted  by falling back on predictable acts of desperation   or else the target s subordinates would replace the target and then act according to the team s predictions  These various ploys would usually result in either information being revealed to the team  or the target s disgrace and discreditation  or both  In many early episodes  the mission was to  neutralize  the target and it was made clear that the target was ultimately shot by his superiors  staff  or rivals  though this was usually not shown on screen  In later seasons  where the targets were usually organized crime figures or similar  the goal of the mission was often simply to collect incriminating evidence not obtainable by  conventional law enforcement agencies   The team was not above falsifying such evidence as a last resort  Dramatic tension was provided by situations in which team members appeared to be in danger of being discovered  especially before commercial breaks   Sometimes unexpected events occurred that forced the team to improvise  On occasion  an outside party or one of the targets realized what was happening and put the success of the plan at risk  According to White  William Read Woodfield and Allan Balter  who served as story consultants for the first two seasons and became producers of the third season  but did not last long  dismissed for believing that executive producer Geller had no authority over them   18  relied heavily on The Big Con  written by David W  Maurer  for their inspiration  Hence Briggs Phelps became the  grifter in charge   Rollin Hand and Cinnamon Carter were highly effective  ropers   and Barney Collier and Willy Armitage were experts at building and or equipping  big stores    edit  Filming locations This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  The original series was filmed almost exclusively around Hollywood and the Los Angeles Basin  The series opener was held at the Griffith Park Observatory with special guest star Wally Cox  Pasadena and the Caltech campus were common locations  Another noted location was the Bradbury Building used in other films and series  from The Outer Limits to Blade Runner   During the final season  most of the exterior shots are of San Francisco  including the City Hall building and Opera House  The later revival was shot entirely in Australia  though it purported to have Phelps living in San Francisco    edit  Variations This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Several times the series deviated from the standard format  In one episode of the original series  a gangster kidnaps the daughter of a friend of Dan Briggs and forces him to abduct a witness against him  In another  one mistake causes Cinnamon Carter to be exposed and captured by the villains  and Jim Phelps has to prepare a plan to rescue her  Another episode featured Phelps on a personal mission  when he returns to his small hometown for a visit and finds a series of murders among his childhood acquaintances  which the local law enforcement chief is unqualified to cope with  In one episode  a friend of Jim Phelps is framed for murder  giving Jim only 24 hours to find the real killer  prove his friend s innocence and save his life  On two occasions  he is captured and the team has to rescue him  In the 1980s series  former IMF agent Barney Collier is framed for a crime he did not commit and the IMF team has to extricate him  leading to a reuniting of Barney with his son and IMF agent Grant Collier  played by real life father and son Greg and Phil Morris   Willy is shot and captured in one episode  and captured and tortured by a drug kingpin in another  Paris is kidnapped and brainwashed in an attempt to get him to kill Phelps  Jim and Rollin are on a hunting trip when Jim is taken mysteriously ill  It turns out the residents of a  Norman Rockwell  town are hired assassins  who attempted to poison Phelps when he stumbled on their secret   edit  Conclusion This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  In most cases  the action lasted right up to the final seconds  with the episode ending in a freeze frame as the IMF team make their escape  another successful mission concluded  Most often they leave in a nondescript panel truck  A dramatic device frequently used at the end was the sound of a gunshot or a scream in the distance as the target is killed by his associates  while the IMF team make their getaway  In the 1980s revival  this format was altered with the addition of a tag scene showing the IMF team regrouping  often still in disguise  and walking away  From the middle of the first season onwards  Jim Phelps often makes a quip   edit  Music Aside from the now iconic main theme  as well as the motif called  The Plot  which usually accompanied scenes of the team members carrying out the mission  the background music would incorporate minimalist innovations of percussion such as simply a snare drum and cymbals to build tension during the more  sneaky  moments of the episodes  sometimes accompanied by a low level flute   These quieter passages would greatly contrast the more bombastic fanfares when a mission member is at risk of getting caught just prior to a commercial break  The main theme was composed by Argentine composer  pianist and conductor Lalo Schifrin and is noted for being in 5 4 time  About the unusual timing  Schiffrin declared that  things are in 2 4 or 4 4 because people dance with two legs  I did it for people from outer space who have five legs   19   The Plot  was also composed by Schifrin  who scored three episodes in the first season and went on to score at least one or two episodes for most of the other seasons  season two is the only one to have no Schifrin scored episodes  in part because he was helping to launch Geller s new series Mannix   Schifrin was awarded two Grammys at the 10th Grammy Awards for his work on the first series  Best Instrumental Theme and Best Original Score for a Motion Picture or TV Show   20  He was was also nominated for two Emmys  for the first and third seasons  Among the other composers to work on the series were Jerry Fielding  Walter Scharf  Gerald Fried  Richard Markowitz  Benny Golson  Robert Drasnin  and Hugo Montenegro   edit  Soundtrack album Although two albums of re recorded music from the original series had previously been released under Schifrin s name  Music from Mission  Impossible  Dot  1967  and More Mission  Impossible  Paramount  1968  the original scores were not commercially available until 1992 when GNP Crescendo released The Best of Mission  Impossible   Then and Now 21  featuring five scores by Lalo Schifrin for the original series and five by John E  Davis for the revival  Schifrin also scored three episodes of the revival  including the premiere  but

Graves  1971  edit  Edgar Best Episode in a TV series   Jerome Ross  for  Operation Rogosh   1967  edit  Inspirations and innovations A key inspiration for Geller in creating the series was the 1964 Jules Dassin film Topkapi  innovative for its coolly existential depiction of an elaborate heist  Geller switched the story away from the criminals of Topkapi to the good guys of the IMF  but kept Dassin s style of minimal dialogue  prominent music scoring and clockwork precision plots executed by a team of diverse specialists  Several episodes in fact show close up shots of an agent s wristwatch to convey the suspense of working on a deadline  One of the more controversial points of Geller s was his insistence on minimizing character development  This was done intentionally both because he felt that seeing the characters as tabulae rasae would make them more convincing in undercover work  and because he wanted to keep the focus on the caper and off the characters themselves  Geller would even veto the writers  attempts to develop the characters in the episodes  This is why  even after Geller was removed from the show  the IMF agents would only have one scene at Jim s apartment where they interacted  and they were rarely if ever seen in their  real  lives  As a side effect of this  cast turnover was never once explained on the show  None of the main characters ever died or were disavowed in the original series  but a character could disappear between episodes without mention or acknowledgment  The 1980s revival  however  did kill off a main character on screen  Bruce Geller had died on May 27  1978 in a plane crash in Santa Barbara  California  so he was unable to potentially veto the decision  Mimi Davis is the only character whose recruitment as an IMF agent shown on screen  although such a scene was filmed for Dana Lambert  Lesley Ann Warren  and discarded  22  The 1980s revival otherwise stayed true to Geller s edict  with the occasional brief exception  The producers of Mission  Impossible were sued for plagiarism by the creators of an ABC show called 21 Beacon Street  The suit was settled out of court  Geller claimed never to have seen the earlier show  Beacon Street s story editor and pilot scripter  Laurence Heath  would later write several episodes of M I  23  Writer William Read Woodfield was a fan of David Maurer s nonfiction book about con artists  The Big Con  also an unofficial inspiration for The Sting   and many episodes are strikingly similar to cons described in the book  24  The tape scene is very similar to one described in the 1964 Nick Carter Killmaster novel Saigon  published in December 1964  In the novel  secret agent Carter receives a package from his boss which  when activated  plays a tape recorded message that self destructs after playing once  Part of each episode s title sequence was highly unusual  as it was composed of a number of very short clips of key scenes from the subject episode  This was  and remains  very rare for series television  However  it was already being done as of the previous season on I Spy  which like Mission had the lighting of a fuse leading to it  The hand with the match was  until sometime in the sixth season  that of creator Bruce Geller  in the revival series  the hand belonged to Peter Graves  who was shown holding the match  Several British teleseries produced by Gerry Anderson and his then wife Sylvia Anderson  the contemporaneous Thunderbirds and the mid 1970s Space  1999  which starred M I alumni Martin Landau and Barbara Bain  among them  also did this  The reimagined Battlestar Galactica TV series also used this device  The clips in the opening sequence were chosen to showcase dramatic moments in the upcoming mission  such as moments of surprise  moments of violence  or equipment in use  In particular  the first clip shown was often someone getting punched and or knocked out  For the first two seasons  the closing credits showed clips from that mission in freeze frame  Starting with Season Three  the same clips were shown during the closing credits across episodes  later seasons eschewed that approach  featuring a freeze frame of the hand lighting the fuse  Mission  Impossible is still recognized for its innovative use of music  Composer Lalo Schifrin wrote several distinctive pieces for the series  The visual cuts in the main title sequence were timed to the beats and measures of the theme tune written in  unusual  5 4 time while an animated burning fuse moved across the screen  Most episodes included fairly long dialogue free sequences showing the team members particularly electronics expert Barney Collier making technical preparations for the mission  usually to the accompaniment of another easily recognizable tune called  The Plot   Lalo Schifrin also wrote a theme piece for each main character and the sound track for each episode incorporated variations of these throughout  Even when an episode s score is credited to some other composer  Desilu s music supervisor Jack Hunsacker would re edit it  adding Schifrin melodies from the library  25  The series had great impact on film and TV music  Before Mission  Impossible  a common compliment was along the lines of  the score worked very well but never got in the way or called attention to itself   By contrast  Mission  Impossible was praised for the prominence of its music  At 171 episodes  the original version of Mission  Impossible held the record for having the most episodes of any English language espionage television series for over 35 years  about 10 more episodes than its nearest rival  the UK produced The Avengers   Its record was broken during the eighth season of 24 in 2010  citation needed  Reruns of Mission

article  List of Mission  Impossible episodes  edit  Original novels A number of original novels based upon the series were published in the late 1960s  Popular Library published the following between 1967 and 1969  Mission  Impossible by John Tiger  1967  Code Name  Judas by Max Walker  1968  Code Name  Rapier by Walker  1968  Code Name  Little Ivan by Tiger  1969  In addition  two hardback novels for young readers were published by Whitman Books  both by Talmage Powell  The Priceless Particle  1969  The Money Explosion  1970  Of the above  only the 1967 John Tiger novel featured the team as led by Dan Briggs  the rest all featured the Jim Phelps era IMF   edit  Revival Main article  Mission  Impossible  1988 TV series  In 1980  media reports indicated that a reunion of the original cast was in the planning stages  for a project to be called Mission  Impossible 1980  Ultimately this project was delayed into 1983  with the working title suitably updated repeatedly  before being cancelled altogether due to one plot after another being deemed inappropriate and unacceptable  26  In 1984  another proposed M I reunion was to have been a theatrical film  titled Good Morning  Mr  Phelps  Mission  Impossible The Movie   Ultimately  the proposed large budget sank this project  27  In 1988  the American fall television season was hampered by a writers  strike that prevented the commissioning of new scripts  Producers  anxious to provide new product for viewers but with the prospect of a lengthy strike  went into the vaults for previously written material  Star Trek  The Next Generation  for example  used scripts written for an aborted Star Trek series proposed for the 1970s  The ABC network decided to launch a new Mission  Impossible series  with a mostly new cast  except for Peter Graves  who would return as Phelps   but using scripts from the original series  suitably updated  To save even more on production costs  the series was filmed in Australia  the first season in Queensland  and the second in Melbourne  Costs were  at that time  some 20 percent lower in Australia than in Hollywood  The new Mission  Impossible was one of the first American commercial network programs to be filmed in Australia  According to Patrick White s book  the original plan was for the series to be an actual remake of the original series  with the new cast playing the same characters from the original series  Rollin Hand  Cinnamon Carter  et al  Just before filming began  White writes  the decision was made to rework the characters so that they were now original creations  albeit still patterned after the originals  with only Jim Phelps remaining unchanged  28  The new series was not a hit  but it was produced cheaply enough to keep it on the ABC schedule  The new M I ultimately lasted for two years  the writers  strike was resolved quickly enough that only four episodes were actual remakes  which  along with the decision to change the character names and backgrounds  resulted in the series being considered a continuation of the original series  rather than simply a remake  The original series formula described above was largely repeated in the second Mission  Impossible series of the 1980s  though the writers took some liberties and tried to stretch the rules somewhat  Most notably  by the time of the revival series  the Impossible Mission Force was no longer a small  clandestine operation  but larger in scale  with references now made to IMF divisions and additional teams similar to the one run by Phelps  One episode of the later series featured the only occasion in which a regular IMF agent was killed on a mission and subsequently disavowed  The 1980s series also had IMF agents using technology that nearly pushed the series into the realm of science fiction  such as one gadget that could record dreams  and another that allowed the IMF to change the surfaces  actually digital screens  of special playing cards to appear to be whatever cards the plan required  The revived series included special appearances by several 1960s 1970s IMF veterans  including Lynda Day George  and Greg Morris as Barney  Morris s son  Phil Morris  played Barney s son in the new series  Four guest stars from the original run all played targets here  Alex Cord  James Shigeta  and in the same episode  Barbara Luna and Australian Michael Pate  In 1997  Barbara Bain reprised the role of Cinnamon Carter for an episode of Diagnosis  Murder titled  Discards   She appeared in the episode alongside Phil Morris  not playing Grant Collier  although Cinnamon mentions having worked with his father   as well as 1960s spy series veterans Robert Culp  I Spy   Robert Vaughn  The Man from U N C L E   and Patrick Macnee  The Avengers   and was the only member of this ensemble to play her original character here  The fact this is the same character is cemented by her mentioning the IMF in dialogue  29   edit  Related items Dell Comics published a
