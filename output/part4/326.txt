by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby  the character first appeared in Fantastic Four  5  July 1962  wearing his trademark metal mask and green cloak  The son of a gypsy witch  Doom is a recurring supervillain  arch enemy of the Fantastic Four  and leader of the fictional nation of Latveria  He is both a genius inventor and a sorcerer  and has served as a primary antagonist and occasional protagonist in the Marvel continuity since his creation  While Doom s chief opponents have been the Fantastic Four  he has also frequently battled Spider Man  Doctor Strange  the Avengers  the X Men  the Punisher  Blade

Creation and development Like many of Marvel s Silver Age characters  Doctor Doom was conceived by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby  With the Fantastic Four title performing well  Lee and Kirby were trying to dream up a  soul stirring super sensational new villain   3  Looking for a name  Lee latched onto  Doctor Doom  as  eloquent in its simplicity   magnificent in its implied menace   3  Fantastic Four  5  July 1962   Doctor Doom s first appearance  Due to the rush to publish  the character was not given a full origin story 3  until Fantastic Four Annual  2  two years after his debut  4  Jack Kirby modeled Doom after Death  with the armor standing in for that character s skeleton   It was the reason for the armor and the hood  Death is connected with armor and the inhuman like steel  Death is something without mercy  and human flesh contains that mercy   5  Kirby further described Doom as being  paranoid   wrecked by his twisted face and wanting the whole world to be like him  5  Kirby went on to say that  Doom is an evil person  but he s not always been evil  He was  respected  but through a flaw in his own character  he was a perfectionist   6  At one point in the Seventies  Kirby drew his interpretation of what Doom would look like under the mask  giving Doom only  a tiny scar on his cheek   7  Due to this slight imperfection  Doom hides his face not from the world  but from himself  7  To Kirby  this is the motivation for Doom s vengeance against the world  because others are superior due to this slight scar  Doom wants to elevate himself above them  6  Typical of Lee s writing characterization of Doom is his arrogance  his pride leads to Doom s disfigurement at the hands of his own machine  and to the failures of many of his schemes  8   There is also an idea that Doom placed his mask on his face before it was fully cool  burning his face  In some early stories glimpses of his face is shown  in which he seems to be bald  While the Fantastic Four had fought various villains such as the Mole Man  Skrulls  the Miracle Man  and Namor the Sub Mariner  Doctor Doom managed to overshadow them all and became the Fantastic Four s archnemesis  9  During the 1970s  Doom branched out to more Marvel titles such as Astonishing Tales  10 The Incredible Hulk  11  and Super Villain Team Up  starting in 1975  as well as appearances in Marvel Team Up  beginning with issue  42  February 1976   Doom s origin was also a feature in Astonishing Tales when his ties to the villain Mephisto were revealed  12   edit  1980s 1990s 1981 saw Marvel and DC Comics collaborate on another project  In 1976 the two companies had published Superman vs  the Amazing Spider Man  and seeking to replicate that success the two companies again teamed the characters up  in Superman and Spider Man  Marvel editor in chief Jim Shooter co wrote the story alongside Marv Wolfman  and recalled choosing Doom based on his iconic status   I figured I needed the heaviest duty bad guy we had to offer   Doctor Doom  Their greatest hero against our greatest villain   13  The same year saw John Byrne begin his six year run writing and illustrating Fantastic Four in 1981  sparking a  second golden age  for the title 14  but also attempting to  turn the clock back       get back and see fresh what it was that made the book great at its inception   15  Doom made his first appearance under Byrne s tenure with issue  236  16  Whereas Kirby had intimated that Doom s disfigurement was more a figment of Victor s vain personality  Byrne expressed that Doom s face was truly ravaged  only Doom s own robot slaves are allowed to see the monarch without his helmet  17  Byrne also emphasized other aspects of Doom s personality  despite his ruthless nature  Doom is a man of his word  18  However  some stories reveal he actually does not care about his devoted people of Latveria 19   though they think he does  or his henchmen  20  returning to Latveria after being temporarily deposed  Doom abandons a scheme to wrest mystical secrets from Doctor Strange in order to oversee his land s reconstruction  17  Though possessing a tempestuous temper  Doom also occasionally shows warmth and empathy to others  he tries to free his mother from Mephisto and treats Kristoff Vernard like his own son  17  Byrne also gave further detail regarding Doom s scarring  Byrne used the idea that the accident at Empire State University only left Doom with a small scar that was exaggerated into a more disfiguring accident by Doom s own arrogance  when Doom puts on the armor forged for him when it had yet to cool  however  he truly damages his face  21  After Byrne s departure Doctor Doom continued to be a major villain in Fantastic Four  and as the 1980s continued Doom appeared in other comics such as Punisher  The Spectacular Spider Man  and Excalibur  Under Fantastic Four writer Steven Englehart  Doom became exiled from Latveria by his heir Kristoff  who was brainwashed into thinking he was Doom  Doom would spend most of his time in exile planning his return  but Englehart left the title before he could resolve the storyline  This storyline ultimately ended with the controversial Fantastic Four  350  where writer Walt Simonson had the Doom who had been seen in the book during the Englehart run being revealed to be a Doombot and the real Doom  in a newly redesigned armor  returning to claim his country from his usurper  Simonson s retcon stated that Doom s last real appearance was in the famous  Battle of Baxter Building  though with occasional trips back home  though Doom was shown to be unaware of certain major changes at the time to the Fantastic Four  An urban legend states that Simonson drew up a list of official stories which featured the real Doom and those which did not 22  but this plotline was dropped and never mentioned again by later writers  who ignored Simonson s declaration as subterfuge Doom stated for the sake of blaming past failures on Doombots  23   edit  Modern depictions In 2003 Doom was the sole villain in the Fantastic Four story arc  Unthinkable   in which Doom imprisons Franklin Richards in Hell and captures Valeria Richards and succeeds in catching the Fantastic Four  Writer Mark Waid sought to redefine Doom s character in a way that had not been seen before  In Waid s reinterpretation  very controversial for many fans   Doom hates Richards for knowing at his core he was right when Doom was wrong  24  25  Waid was also convinced that the  truism that Victor Von Doom is  despite his villainy  a noble man   as suggested in both Lee s and Byrne s run   is absolute crap        A man  Doom  whose entire motivating force is jealousy is ridiculously petty  not grandly noble  Yes  Doom is regal  and yes  whenever possible  Doom likes to act as if he possesses great moral character  because to him that s what great men have      but when I hear Doom say it  does not suit him to  do this and such  what I hear is   it has nothing to do with my hatred for Reed Richards  so it s not worth my time    Waid also stated that Doom  would tear the head off a newborn baby and eat it like an apple while his mother watched if it would somehow prove he were smarter than Reed   25  Waid punctuated this reinterpretation of Doom during his  Unthinkable  saga  Vol 2  66 70  amp  Vol 1  restart   500  as an absolute sadist by having Von Doom ruthlessly murder Valeria  his first love and granddaughter to his long serving faithful retainer Boris  in order to be granted access to powerful magic by a trio of demons  Valeria being the treasured possession that they demanded in exchange  He subsequently attempted to prove his superiority to Reed by giving him the chance to find his way out of a prison that could only be escaped by mastering magic  in the belief that Reed would fail to do so  but with the aid of the astral projection of Doctor Strange Reed learned to master magic by accepting that he could not understand it  This fight resulted in Doom being trapped in Hell when Reed tricked him into rejecting the demons  until the events of Ragnarok  when Thor s hammer Mjolnir fell through dimensions and gave Doom a way out of Hell when it was lost after Thor s apparent  death   In 2005 and 2006  Doom was featured in his own limited series  Books of Doom  a retelling of the origin story by Ed Brubaker  26  In an interview  Brubaker said the series was a way to elaborate on the earlier portions of Doom s life which had not been seen often in the comics  The series also set out to determine if Doom s path from troubled child to dictator was fated or Doom s own faults led to his corruption   in essence  a nature versus nurture question  27  Brubaker s version of Doom was heavily influenced by the original Lee Kirby version  responding to a question if he would show Doom s face  Brubaker stated  following Kirby s example  I think it s better not to show it   26  The Mighty Avengers invaded Latveria  Doom s nation  due to his involvement in creating a chemical bomb that would infect people with the symbiote  Although it was recently revealed that this attack was actually set up by Kristoff Vernard to put Doom out of the picture prior to Kristoff s future attempt at a coup   28  Due to Ultron s interference  the bomb was dropped on Manhattan  but the Mighty Avengers are able to stop the effects on the people  The Mighty Avengers proceed to invade Latveria  During the invasion  the Sentry  Iron Man  and Doom are sent to the past thanks to Doom s time platform  Eventually  the trio breaks into the Baxter Building and make use of a confiscated time machine to return to the present era  the Sentry taking advantage of the fact he will soon be forgotten by the world to easily defeat the Thing  Doom transports himself to Morgana s castle to summon up a magical army and captures the Avengers  but they free themselves and he is arrested for terrorist crimes against humanity after a brief struggle that culminated with the Sentry tearing off Doom s mask  During Dark Reign when Norman Osborn is in charge  Doom is released and sent back to Latveria  However  Morgana le Fay engages him in a magical battle  which he is losing until the Dark Avengers rescue him  He then magically rebuilds his kingdom  29  The character is also featured in

deal with him to restore his mental capacities if he helps Reed and the Fantastic Four  Doom agrees to her proposition  33  Later  Doctor Doom appears among those in attendance at Johnny Storm s funeral  34  Due to the agreement  Doctor Doom was recommended by Nathaniel and Valeria Richards to be a member of the Future Foundation  35  Objecting  Thing attacks Doom out of anger  but the fight was stopped by Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman  who welcomes Doctor Doom to their group  36  In a recent issue of the Hulk series  it was revealed that Doom performed brain surgery on Hulk to separate him from Banner  extracting the uniquely Banner elements from Hulk s brain and cloning a new body for Banner  in return for an initially unspecified favour from the Hulk  37  However  when Doom demands to keep Banner for his own purposes  the Hulk goes back on the deal and flees with Banner s body  leaving his alter ego in the desert where he was created to ensure that Doom cannot use Banner s intellect 38    edit  Fictional character biography This section requires expansion  Victor von Doom was born decades ago to a tribe of Latverian gypsies under the rule of an unnamed nobleman called the Baron  Victor s mother was a witch named Cynthia who died by Mephisto s hand while Doom was young  Victor s father  Werner  was the leader of the tribe and a renowned medicine man who kept his wife s sorceress life quiet in order to protect Victor from a similar fate  Soon after Cynthia s death  the Baron s wife grew incurably ill from cancer and Werner was called to the capitol to heal her  When she succumbed to illness  the Baron labeled Werner a murderer and called for his death  Werner escaped with young Victor  having realized the night before the woman would die  He goes on to die of exposure on the mountainside  cradling the boy in a final embrace and giving him his garments to keep him warm  Victor survived and  on return to the gypsy camp  discovered his mother s occult instruments and swore revenge on the Baron  Victor grew into a headstrong and brilliant man  combining sorcery and technology to create fantastic devices to keep the Baron s men at bay and protect the gypsies  His exploits attracted the attention of the dean of Empire State University  who sent someone to the camp  39  Offered the chance to study in the United States  Doom chooses to leave his homeland and his love  Valeria  behind  Once in the United States  Victor met fellow student and future nemesis Reed Richards  who was intended to be his roommate  but Doom disliked him and asked for another roommate  After a time  Victor constructed a machine intended to communicate with the dead  Though Richards tried to warn him about a flaw in the machine  seeing his calculations were a few decimals off  Victor continued on with disastrous results  The machine violently failed and the resulting explosion seemingly severely damaged his face  39  Expelled after the accident  Victor traveled the world until he collapsed on a Tibetan mountainside  Rescued by a clan of monks  Victor quickly mastered the monks  disciplines as well as the monks themselves  Victor then forged himself a suit of armor  complete with a scowling mask  and took the name Doctor Doom  39  As Doom  he would go on to menace those he felt responsible for his accident primarily  Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four  He succeeded in taking over Latveria  taking an interest in the welfare of the Roma  In his first appearance  Doom travels back in time to steal the enchanted treasure of Blackbeard and conquer the world  but he is fooled by Reed Richards  who swaps the treasure with worthless chains  40  Returning to Earth after learning the secrets of an advanced alien race  Doom exchanges consciousnesses with Mr  Fantastic  Richards  inhabiting Doom s body  switches the two back  and Doom ends up trapped in a micro world  41  Doom takes over the micro world and returns before being thrown into space  42  Doom is saved by Rama Tut  and he returns to Earth to destroy the Fantastic Four by turning each member against the other using a special berry juice  Richards outwits Doom by using the hallucinogenic juice against the villain  Doom  believing he has killed Richards in a test of willpower  departs certain of his victory and superior intelligence  43  During the 1960s  Doom tricks Spider Man into joining forces with him  44  and he also menaces the Avengers when Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch travel to Latveria to find a long lost relative  45  He steals the Silver Surfer s powers in 1967  but he loses them after breaching a barrier Galactus set for the Surfer on Earth  46  47  During the 1970s  Doom branched out to more Marvel titles  with a battle between Doom and Prince Rudolfo over control of Latveria being featured in Astonishing Tales  48  Doom also attempts to use the Hulk as his slave during two issues of The Incredible Hulk  49  The character also made several appearances in the story arcs of Super Villain Team Up  starting in 1975  as well as appearances in Marvel Team Up  beginning with issue  42  February 1976   In August 1981  Doctor Doom also made an appearance in Iron Man when the two travel to Camelot  50  During John Bryne s run in the 1980s  Doom attempts to steal cosmic powers on Terrax  but Doom s body is destroyed in the resulting fight between Terrax and the Silver Surfer  51  Doom survives by transferring his consciousness to another human  and is returned to his original body by the Beyonder  52  In the 2000s  Doom rediscovered his mystical heritage  using his powers in an attempt to destroy the Fantastic Four after making a deal with a group of demons called the Hazarath Three  but later is consigned to a hell dimension after Richards manages to trick him into rejecting the idea that the demons aided him  He escapes and attempts to claim Thor s mystical hammer Mjolnir for himself  after the rift the hammer created as it fell to Earth following the destruction of Asgard allowed him to escape  The plot fails due to his inability to lift the hammer  and Doom returns to Latveria to rule once again  Later  a Doombot was taken down by Reed Richards  Henry Pym  Iron Man  She Hulk and others in New York City  Whether or not it was sent by Doom himself remains to be seen  as does his role in the overall conflict  Doom was not invited to the wedding of Storm and the Black Panther  However  he did send a present  an invitation to form an alliance with Latveria  using the Civil War currently going on among the hero community as a reason to quite possibly forge an alliance between their two countries  When Black Panther  on a diplomatic mission to other countries with Storm  did show up in Latveria  he presented them with a real present  and extended another invitation to form an alliance with Black Panther  He demonstrated behavior very uncharacteristic of him  however  which may or may not become a plot point later  Panther spurned the invitation  detonating an EMP that blacked out a local portion of Latveria before Doom s robots could destroy his ship  Later on  Doctor Doom is then shown collaborating with the Red Skull on a weapon which will only  be the beginning  of Captain America s suffering  Doctor Doom gave the Red Skull the weapon because the Red Skull gave Victor pieces of technology from an old German castle  The castle was owned by a  Baron of Iron  centuries prior  who had used his technological genius to protect himself and his people  The map the Red Skull used to find the castle bore a picture of Doctor Doom  Doctor Doom states that the technology the Red Skull gave him is more advanced than what he currently has  and that he will become the Baron of Iron in his future  The Red Skull is currently in the process of reverse engineering Doom s weapon for multiple uses  rather than the single use Doom agreed to  At the end of the first chapter of the X Men event Endangered Species  Doctor Doom is among the supervillain geniuses that Beast contacts to help him reverse the effects of Decimation  He spurns Beast by stating that genetics do not number among his talents  In Spider Man  One More Day  Doctor Doom was among those that Spider Man contacts to help save Aunt May  Doctor Doom also makes Latveria into a refugee camp for the Atlanteans following the destruction of their underwater kingdom 53  as well as becoming allies with Loki in his plot to manipulate Thor into unwittingly release his Asgardian enemies  54  Doctor Doom later defends Latveria from the Mighty Avengers  following a revelation that it was one of Doctor Doom s satellites that carried the  Venom Virus  released in New York City  55  In a battle with Iron Man and the Sentry  the time travel mechanism within his armor overloads  trapping Doom and his opponents at some point in the past  Doctor Doom continues a relationship with Morgan le Fay using his time machine  56  He and Iron Man managed to get back to the present  but Doctor Doom has left Iron Man in his exploding castle  Despite this  Doctor Doom ended up incarcerated at The Raft  During the Secret Invasion storyline  Doctor Doom was among the villains who escaped the Raft when a virus was uploaded into its systems by the Skrulls  In the aftermath of the Secret Invasion  Doctor Doom is a member of the Dark Illuminati alongside Norman Osborne  Emma Frost  Namor  Loki s female form  and Hood  At the end of this meeting  Namor and Doctor Doom are seen having a discussion of their own plans that have all ready been set in motion  57  Doom soon allies himself with the isolationist group known as the Desturi  to take control of Wakanda  He attacked and wounded T Challa  the current Black Panther  maiming him enough to prevent him from holding the mantle again  Doom s main objective was to secure Wakanda s store of vibranium  which he could mystically enhance to make himself unstoppable  Doom was also a part of the supervillain group known as the Intelligencia  but was betrayed when they captured him to complete their plan  With the help of Bruce Banner  he escaped  and returned to Latveria  He appears to have been damaged by this experiences  At the start of the Siege storyline  Doctor Doom is with the Cabal discussing the current problems with the X Men and both Avengers teams  Doom demands that Osborn at once reverse his course of action against his ally Namor  to which Osborn refuses  saying that he and Emma Frost had  crossed the line  with him  Doom  loathing Thor and the Asgardians all the more due to his recent defeat at their hands  claims that he will support Osborn s  madness  should Namor be returned to him  but Osborn refuses  Osborn s mysterious ally  the Void  violently attacks Doctor Doom  and an apparently amused Loki tells the Hood that he should go  as there is nothing here for either of them  which the Hood  now loyal to Loki due to his hand in the restoration of his mystical abilities  agrees  However  it is revealed that  Doom  is actually an upgraded Doombot  which releases swarms of Doombot nanites against the Cabal  tearing down Avengers Tower and forcing its denizens  such as the Dark Avengers  to evacuate  Osborn is rescued by the Sentry  who destroys the body  When Osborn contacts Doom  Doom tells him not to ever strike him again or he is willing to go further  30  It has been revealed that the Scarlet Witch seen in Wundagore Mountain is actually a Doombot which apparently means that the real one has been captured by Doom sometime after the House of M event  58  It is revealed that Wanda s enhanced powers were a result of her and Doctor Doom s combined attempt to channel the Life Force in order to resurrect her children  This proves to be too much for Wanda to contain and it overtook her  With Wiccan and Doctor Doom s help  they seek to use the entity that is possessing Wanda to restore mutantkinds  powers  This is stopped by the Young Avengers  who are concerned at the fall out that would ensue if the powerless mutants are suddenly repowered  only to find out Doom s real plan  to transfer the entity into his own body and gaining Wanda s god like powers for himself  59  Doctor Doom becomes omnipotent with powers surpassing those of beings as the Beyonder or the Cosmic Cube  The Young Avengers confront him  but Doctor Doom kills Cassie just before Wanda and Wiccan stole his new found powers  60  At the start of the story arc Fantastic Four  Three  Doctor Doom felt that he needed to be  reborn  and was making plans to abdicate his throne and give it to Kristoff when Valeria teleported to his room unexpectedly asking for his assistance to help her father  Valeria quickly notices that Doctor Doom has suffered brain damage and makes a deal with him to restore his mental capacities if he helps Reed and the Fantastic Four  Doom agrees to her proposition  33  Later  Doctor

Objecting  Thing attacks Doom out of anger  but the fight was stopped by Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman  who welcomes Doctor Doom to their group  When Valeria asks Doctor Doom if he has a backup for restoring his memories  he reveals that Kristoff Vernard is his backup  Afterward  Mr  Fantastic  Spider Man  Nathaniel  Valeria  and Doctor Doom head to Latveria to meet with Kristoff and request his help  Mister Fantastic sets up a brain transfer machine in order to help restore Doctor Doom s memories and knowledge  which is successful  When Kristoff wants to return the throne to him  Doctor Doom states that it is not time yet because of a promise he made to Valeria  When Mister Fantastic asks what promise Doctor Doom made to Valeria  Doctor Doom states that he made a promise to help defeat Mister Fantastic  36  Doctor Doom decides to hold a symposium on how to finally defeat Reed Richards  The Thing and the evolved Moloids give an invitation to the High Evolutionary  Dragon Man and Alex Power give an invitation to Diablo  Upon receiving an invitation from Spider Man  Mad Thinker is convinced to take part in the event  Bentley 23 even gives an invitation to his creator  the Wizard  along with two A I M  lieutenants  However  it is subsequently revealed that the  Richards  they have been invited to defeat are actually members of the  Council of Reeds   alternate versions of Reed who were trapped in this universe by Valeria a while back  possessing Reed s intellect while lacking his conscience   61  While Spider Man and Invisible Woman make sandwiches for the kids  Mister Fantastic  Doctor Doom  Valeria  and Nathaniel Richards meet with the supervillain geniuses and Uatu the Watcher about what to do with the Council of Reeds  62   edit  Powers and abilities Doctor Doom steals the Silver Surfer s powers in Fantastic Four  57  1966   Art by Jack Kirby  Doctor Doom is a polymath scientific genius  Throughout most of his publication history  he has been depicted as one of the most intelligent humans in the Marvel Universe    equal only to his arch rival Reed Richards  and perhaps even more intelligent than Richards himself  This is shown on many occasions  most famously by actually curing Ben Grimm of his Thing form 63  which Richards has never repeated  Yet another occasion in which Doom shows himself superior  includes Doom s revival of Namor s sleeping incapacitated citizens  which Reed Richards could not accomplish with any number of attempts  Doom has constructed numerous devices in order to defeat his foes or gain more power  including a time machine  a device to imbue people with superpowers  and numerous robots  Doom s calculating and strategic nature leads him to use  Doombots   exact mechanical replicas of the real Doctor Doom  for many missions  typically those where he fears defeat  Sometimes the Doombots even believe themselves to be Doctor Doom  17  The character has also used his scientific talents to steal or replicate the power of other beings such as the Silver Surfer  or in one case the Beyonder  Doctor Doom also possesses considerable mystical capabilities due to teachings from Tibetan monks  and tutoring from his lover Morgan Le Fey  He is capable of energy projection  creating protective shields  and summoning hordes of demonic creatures  64  The alien Ovoids taught Doom the process of psionically transferring his consciousness into another nearby being through a simple eye contact  as well as showing him other forms of technology 65  66  which Doom uses to escape from incarcerations and to avoid getting killed  67  68  however  if his concentration is broken  it can transfer his mind back  and he rarely uses this power unless absolutely necessary due to his own ego about his appearance  Doom can exert technopathic control over certain machines  most notably  the Doombots  In addition  Doom has a remarkably strong will  as demonstrated in the graphic novel  Emperor Doom when he dared his prisoner  the mind controlling Purple Man  to attempt to control him and he successfully resists  Also  without his armor he proved himself to be a skilled bare handed fighter  capable of killing someone and even a lion with a single hit  69  70  Doom s armor augments his natural physical strength to superhuman levels  to the point where he is able to hold his own against Spider Man in hand to hand combat  71  although he tends to rely on long range tactics when engaging physically stronger foes like Thor or the Hulk  It is also highly resistant to harm  at one point even surviving heat levels equal to that of the sun  Doom s armor has been shown to hold its own against Iron Man s  In addition  the armor can generate a defensive force field 72  and a lethal electric shock killing anyone who might come in contact with Doom  72  The armor is self supporting  equipped with internal stores and recycling systems for air  food  water  and energy  allowing the wearer to survive lengthy periods of exposure underwater or in outer space  As the absolute monarch of Latveria  Dr  Doom has diplomatic immunity  allowing him to escape prosecution for most of his crimes  and total control of the nation s natural and technological resources  as well as its manpower  economy  and military  In Fantastic Four 566 569 Doctor Doom received a significant power upgrade  He was thrown back in time  perhaps about 50 million years  by the Marquis of Death  Doom then fought through time and space to get back to present to seek revenge on the Marquis of Death  Doom stated  as he killed the Marquis  he had rebuilt every molecule of his being and increased his power all to destroy the Marquis  In later issues this seems to have been ignored however  with writers treating Doctor Doom the way they have always before in terms of power  Although it may be that he had to expend his power to destroy the Marquis  Doom is known for the frequent plot device wherein it is revealed the his actions were actually those of a  Doombot   one of Doom s many robot doubles  either working on his behalf or as a result of rogue artificial intelligence  On many occasions  Doom s only real weakness has been shown to be his arrogance  Layla Miller once reflecting that Doom is incapable of accepting that he himself might be the reason for his failures  While his high opinion of himself is generally accurate  possessing sufficient resources to stand up to virtually every hero and villain in the Marvel Universe and walk away despite their greater natural powers  he is notably generally unable to accept when others may have a better understanding of a situation than he does   although he has been noted to have enough respect for heroes such as Reed Richards or the Thing to at least listen to their recommendations about threats that he himself has not encountered rather than dismiss them instantly   and even when forced to team up with others to defeat a greater threat Doom has been shown to be willing to try to gain a personal advantage when the more expedient course of action would be to stick to the plan and try for greater rewards later  such as when he tried to steal the Infinity Gauntlet from Thanos during the heroes  initial assault against the Titan rather than adhere to Adam Warlock s plan of attack and attempt to acquire the Gauntlet after Thanos had been defeated  Doom adheres to a strict code of honor at all times  so much so that it is accepted by nearly every character in the Marvel Universe that he always keeps his word  no matter what the cost to himself or his plans may be  It is also understood that Doom will keep his exact word  which may or may not be beneficial to the person to whom he has given his promise  For example  Doom may swear that he will not harm an individual  but that only means he will not personally harm that person  it does not mean he will prevent others from harming that person  If someone saves his life  Doom will set aside any personal gain or goal in order to repay that debt  He once saved Captain America from drowning  despite the fact that Captain America had thwarted his plans many times in the past  because Captain America had earlier saved his life  On another occasion he thanked Spider Man for saving him from terrorists attacking him in an airport by allowing him to leave despite Spider Man subsequently insulting him  His code of honor also means that he will not attack a respected opponent who is weakened or at a severe disadvantage  as he regards any victory resulting from such circumstances as hollow and meaningless  He has even on several occasions battled opponents who were intent on killing the Fantastic Four  for no other reason than the fact that he does not want the ultimate defeat of the Fantastic Four to come from anyone s hands but his own   edit  Other versions Main article  Alternative versions of Doctor Doom Doctor Doom s status as one of the Fantastic Four s greatest villains 9  has led to his appearance in many of Marvel s alternate universes and spinoffs  in which the character s history  circumstances and behavior vary from the mainstream setting   edit  In other media Doctor Doom has been included in almost every media adaptation of the Fantastic Four franchise  including film  television  and computer and video games   edit  Television Dr  Doom s first animated appearance was in 1966 on the Sub Mariner s segment of The Marvel Super Heroes  Doom subsequently appeared in several episodes of Hanna Barbera s Fantastic Four series from 1967  where he was voiced by Joseph Sirola  In 1978  Dr  Doom appeared in two episodes of DePatie Freleng Enterprises  The New Fantastic Four voiced by John Stephenson  Perhaps most significantly  Dr  Doom appeared in no less than six episodes of the 1981 Spider Man series produced by Marvel Productions  Voiced by Ralph James  with heavy modulation akin to Darth Vader   the latter five episodes  written by Larry Parr  comprised a complete story arc  and four of them were at one point edited together into an animated feature  In The Fantastic Four  1994 1996   he was voiced by John Vernon and Neil Ross in season one and by Simon Templeman in season two  In  Mask of Doom   he captured the Fantastic Four and forced Mister Fantastic  Human Torch  and the Thing to go back in time and obtain an object for him  In  Silver Surfer and the Return of Galactus   he steals the Silver Surfer s powers and destroy the Fantastic Four  but is tricked by the FF who are in the fantastic car with the Silver Surfer  to follow them to outer space  but due to Galactus  decree that the Silver Surfer may not surf the cosmos ever again is thwarted by the planet devourer himself and the Power Cosmic is returned to the Surfer  In  And a Blind Man Shall Lead Them   he struck at a powerless FF and had his hands crushed by the Thing  In  Nightmare in Green   he directed the Hulk to attack the team  In  Doomsday   he again acquired the Power Cosmic in the series finale  Once again  he is tricked into going to outer space  only to hit the barrier that prevents the Silver Surfer from leaving Earth  Simon Templeman reprised his role for guest appearances in two episodes of The Incredible Hulk  1996 1997   in which Doom held Washington  D C  captive  only to be defeated by She Hulk  whom he later attempted to claim revenge upon  With his appearance on this show  it can be assumed that Doom survived the fate he met on the Fantastic Four series  if both shows are to be considered within the same continuity  Tom Kane took over voicing the character for a three part guest spot in the final season of Spider Man  1994 1998   re imagining Doom s role in the Secret Wars  In the third part of the episode  Doom turned part of the alien world he was on into  New Latveria  after overthrowing Doctor Octopus and renaming Octavia  New Latveria   However  he did not use his ruling powers to oppress  and allowed the aliens in his country to live in peace and harmony  protecting them from the other villains  He even kidnapped the Thing only to cure him of his deformity  turning him back to Ben Grimm  and healed his own face as an afterthought  With Ben s cooperation  he then stole the powers of the Beyonder  and with this newfound power  Doctor Doom sent the other villains back to Earth and almost killed the superheroes that Ben fought along with  However  the Thing turned Doom s weapon on him  and the powers of the Beyonder were returned to the mystic figure himself  Doom was then returned to Earth with no memory of these events  as well as  presumably  his scarred face   along with every other villain and superhero apart from Spider Man  Doctor Doom is the most recurring antagonist in Fantastic Four  World s Greatest Heroes voiced by Paul Dobson  In the pilot   Doomsday   he is revealed to have diplomatic immunity as a head of state  which means the American police cannot place him under arrest  In one episode where in one of his experiments his mind gets put into Reed Richards body  and vice versa  more is revealed about Doom s life and ruling attitude  Doom  with Richards  mind  is now considerably more polite and respectful of others  Reed also commands the Doombots to destroy themselves as  word of Doom is law   and releases the face mask  Though the viewer is not shown Doom s face  when Reed and Doom return to their proper bodies  Richards tells Doom that Doom s insecurity  in particular about his personal appearance  is his greatest adversary  Doctor Doom appears as the primary antagonist in the first season of The Super Hero Squad Show voiced by Charlie Adler  He is after the Infinity Sword and has enlisted a number of villains to help him obtain it  73  Doctor Doom first appears in the Iron Man  Armored Adventures episode  The Might of Doom  74  voiced by Christopher Britton  In this show  Doctor Doom s armor was declared so advanced that Tony stated it made his armor  look like a toaster with arms   The background and basis of the character is vastly different from his printed page version  Here  Victor Von Doom is a member of the royal family of Latervia  not a gyspy   he was married  his scarring accident happened in Latveria  not as ESU with Reed Richards intervening  and resulted in him killing the ruling portion of his family thus inheriting the throne  not overthrowing the reigning Prince Zorba  and he has rarely visited the USA  unlike printed page Doom who has a scaled down version of his Castle Doom as his embassy in the USA   No mention of the Fantastic Four are made in this episode regarding Doom s background  suggesting either the Fantastic Four do not exist in this reality or have no known interaction thus far with Doom  Doctor Doom appeared in New York to meet up with Obadiah Stane  in order to obtain the armor specifications from stolen Iron Man files  and in return would improve Stane s  Monger Core  generator  After the retrieval of the specs occurred  Doom fought Iron Man and put him into a three hour deep sleep  also beating War Machine  After the core was upgraded  Doctor Doom activated a timer that would first have the generator absorb all the energy in New York then expel it in one enormous blast  Iron Man  however was able to stop the timer  angering Doctor Doom  War Machine landed Doctor Doom s plane  who returned the favor by nearly defeating the two armored heroes in a two on one battle  During the battle between Iron Man and Doctor Doom following War Machine s retreat  Doctor Doom prepares to envoke the magic of Dormammu to defeat Iron Man  Just then  S H I E L D  arrives to end the fight as it s agents escort Doctor Doom back to Latveria as Doctor Doom vows to fight Iron Man again  As Doctor Doom is given a ride back to Latveria  Nick Fury then states to Iron Man that they have been keeping an eye on Doctor Doom even though he has diplomatic immunity and then quotes  Son  we know all about Doom  When he makes a mistake  S H I E L D  will be there to take him down   It is later revealed by Pepper Potts to Tony that Doctor Doom s armor was based on Makluan technology  Doctor Doom is confirmed to appear in at least one more episode of the second season  75  Doctor Doom will appear in The Avengers  Earth s Mightiest Heroes  Doctor Doom was already mentioned in this series in the episode  The Breakout  Pt  1 when Iron Man talks to Pepper Potts saying they had trouble and Iron Man responding  Let me guess his name rhymes with  Boom   Lucia von Bardas had a cameo doing a trade with A I M on Doctor Doom s behalf  76  He will debut in the episode  The Private War of Doctor Doom   The episode has been shown as a promotion event at the 2011 San Diego and New York Comic Con events  77  It will be broadcast along with the other episodes of the second season in 2012  The Ultimate Marvel version of Doctor Doom will appear as one of the main antagonists in the upcoming Ultimate Spider Man TV series  78   edit  Film Doctor Doom is the main antagonist from the unreleased film based on the Fantastic Four  which was produced by Roger Corman in 1994  In it  Doom  portrayed by Joseph Culp  was a college classmate of Reed Richards  who was nearly killed in an accident when both he and Reed try to capture the power of a comet called Colossus  Doctor Doom is the main antagonist in the 2005 film Fantastic Four played by Julian McMahon  In the film Doctor Doom seems to be more based on his Ultimate counterpart  He was in the spaceship with Fantastic Four and started trasforming in iron humanoid  controlling electricity  He kidnapped Reed Richards and froze him  but The Thing stopped him and all four burned him down and froze him with water  In the final part of the film he was transported in Latveria  Doctor Doom returns as a villain in the sequel Fantastic Four  Rise of the Silver Surfer with McMahon reprising the role  After Silver Surfer had attacked him  he transformed back in human form and helped Fantastic Four to catch Silver Surfer  Afterwards he then steals the Surfers board and his powers  The Fantastic Four battle the cosmic energy empowered Doom  succeeding in breaking Doom s control over the Surfer s board and powers   edit  Video games Doctor Doom faces off against Magneto in the 1995 fighting game Marvel Super Heroes  Doctor Doom has appeared in several video games  He was the final boss in the 1989 computer game Spider Man and Captain America in Doctor Doom s Revenge  He

character for the PSP version of Marvel Nemesis  Rise of the Imperfects  He was confirmed to be a playable character in Marvel Nemesis 2  Fall of the Imperfects  until the game was canceled  In the special edition of Ultimate Spider Man  the player will view concept art that shows the Beetle presenting the Sandman vial to Doctor Doom after Beetle has evaded Spider Man  Doctor Doom is the primary antagonist of Marvel  Ultimate Alliance  voiced by Clive Revill  Spider Woman and Black Panther have special dialogue with him  In the game  he attempts  and succeeds  in stealing the power of Odin  To do this  he forms a new Masters of Evil and makes a pact with Mephisto to obtain his Twilight Sword  It was mentioned that Doctor Doom corrupted Medusa when she was looking for the Ultimate Nullifier on Muir Island  While the players were obtaining the Muonic Inducer and the M Kraan Crystal  Doctor Doom defeated every hero that tried to stop him and discovered that Odin s powers allowed him to corrupt the defeated heroes  such as Psylocke  Hulk  Cyclops  Professor X  Magneto  Beast  Gambit  Colossus  Emma Frost  and the Punisher  in the Doom s Day cutscene  into his dark superhero army  and then used it to corrupt Earth  It was also discovered that he can use the powers of Odin to create evil clones of superheroes out of nothingness resulting in the creations of Dark Captain America  Dark Spider Man  Dark Iron Man  Dark Thor  and the Dark Fantastic Four and corrupted Colossus  Cyclops and Psylocke  At the end of the game  once Doom is defeated  Odin s powers are returned and he strikes Doom with a bolt of lightning  leaving only the villain s mask  Thor later states Doom is in the possession of Odin along with Loki  the reason as to which Odin is  occupied  as Thor put it   Doom is a playable character downloadable for owners of the Xbox 360 version of the game  If the player uses Doctor Doom and challenges himself in the last level  the game takes a strange but interesting turn  The Doctor Doom that is fought is  in reality  a Doctor Doom from a future in which Ragnar k has occurred  and all the gods of Asgard are dead  Doctor Doom  in an attempt to remedy this  travels to the present to usurp the power of Odin  and in the process  forms the Masters of Evil  However  the Doom from the present notices the presence of Doombots uncontrolled by himself  suspecting Reed Richards or Tony Stark  It is only until he meets his future self that he realizes that it is necessary to defeat the future Doom to keep the world from being destroyed  even though he is not without reluctance of relinquishing command over the power of Odin  This gives a complex and positive vision about the character and shows his high sense of honor  Doctor Doom appears in the Fantastic Four  Rise of the Silver Surfer video game voiced by Gideon Emery  He plays a bigger role in the game than in the film as after he acquires the Surfer s powers  he intends to use them to fight Galactus and save Earth  though he only does this so he can conquer it afterwards   Unlike the film  he builds a machine to strip Galactus of most of his cosmic power for himself  but the F4 use his machine against him to defeat him  A statue of Doctor Doom is seen in Marvel  Ultimate Alliance 2  When the player asks Thor on how Asgard is doing if one speaks to him after the Latverian mission  Thor mentions that he and Loki are still being punished by Odin  Though it is said Doom is dead  Doom is also mentioned as one of the villains who could control the nanite infected humans  despite the fact he is considered deceased  A dossier on Doom can be found in Latveria  Doctor Doom appears in the Marvel Super Hero Squad video game voiced by Charlie Adler  Regular  Ultimate  and Professor

to full fledged villains  often with upgraded powers  80  Doom is also emblematic of a specific subset of supervillain  which comic book critic Peter Sanderson describes as a  megavillain   80  These supervillains are genre crossing villains who exist in adventures  in a world in which the ordinary laws of nature are slightly suspended   characters such as Professor Moriarty  Count Dracula  Auric Goldfinger  Hannibal Lecter  and Darth Vader  also fit this description  80  Sanderson also found traces of William Shakespeare s characters Richard III and Iago in Doctor Doom  all of them  are descended from the  vice  figure of medieval drama   who address the audience in monologues detailing their thoughts and ambitions  81  Described as  iconic   82  Doom is one of the most well received supervillains of the Marvel universe  as well as one of the most recurring  82  in his constant battles with heroes and other villains  Doom has appeared more times than any other villain  9  The comics site Panels of Awesome ranked Doom as the number one villain in their listing of the top ten villains in comics  83 Wizard Magazine went a step further by declaring Doom the fourth greatest villain of all time  84  Comic Book Resources ranks Doom as their fourth favorite Marvel character  Journalist Brent Ecenbarger cited him being able to  stand up against entities like Mephisto  the Beyonder  and Galactus and often come out on top   as well as the tragedy of any  other number of circumstances could have led to Doom being a savior  but as it is  instead he remains Marvel s greatest villain   Fellow journalist Jason Stanhope called his  master ing  of sorcery and technology an unusual combination   and also felt  his inner sense of nobility sets him apart from lesser villains  in a similar manner to Magneto   85  Doom has also been favorably regarded by those who wrote for the character  Stan Lee declared Doom his favorite villain  saying   Doom  could come to the United States and he could do almost anything  and we could not arrest him because he has diplomatic immunity  Also  he wants to rule the world and if you think about it  wanting to rule the world is not a crime   86 Mark Waid echoed Lee s assessment of the character  stating that Doom   has  got a great look  a great visual design  and  a dynamite origin   87  A ride called Doctor Doom s Fearfall
