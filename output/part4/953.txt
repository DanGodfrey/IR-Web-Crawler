reaching global dimensions during the Cold War  Most citation needed  anti communists reject who   the concept of historical materialism  which is a central idea in Marxism  Anti communists reject the Marxist belief that capitalism will be followed by socialism and communism  just as feudalism was followed by capitalism  Anti communists question the validity of the Marxist claim that the socialist state will  wither away  when it becomes unnecessary in a true communist society  Anti communists argue that the repression in the early years of Bolshevik rule  while not as extreme as that during Stalin s reign  was still severe by reasonable standards  citing examples such as Felix Dzerzhinsky s secret police  which eliminated numerous political opponents by extrajudicial executions  and the brutal crushing of the Kronstadt rebellion and Tambov rebellion  Some anti communists refer to both Communism and fascism as totalitarianism  seeing similarity between the actions of communist and fascist governments  Historian Robert Conquest has argued that Communism was responsible for tens of millions of deaths during the 20th century  Opponents who   argue that Communist parties that have come to power have tended to be rigidly intolerant of political opposition  These opponents claim that most Communist countries have shown no signs of advancing from Marx s socialist stage of economy to an ideal communist stage  Rather  Communist governments have been accused of creating a new ruling class  a Nomenklatura   with powers and privileges greater than those previously enjoyed by the upper classes in the non communist regimes  Contents 1 Anti communist movements 1 1 Left wing anti communism 1 1 1 Anarchists 1 2 Capitalists 1 2 1 Objectivism 1 3 Ex communists 1 4 Fascism and far

individualist or anarcho capitalist point of view  The anarchist Mikhail Bakunin debated with Karl Marx in the First International  arguing that the Marxist state is another form of oppression  1  He loathed the idea of a vanguard party ruling the masses from above  Anarchists initially participated in  and rejoiced over  the 1917 revolution as an example of workers taking power for themselves

optimized in private competition  See economic calculation debate  In the Communist Manifesto  Marx lays out a 10 point plan advising the redistribution of land and production  and Ludwig von Mises argues that the initial and ongoing forms of redistribution constitute direct coercion  2  3  Neither Marx s 10 point plan nor the rest of the manifesto say anything about who has the right to carry out the plan  4 Milton Friedman argued that the absence of voluntary economic activity makes it too easy for repressive political leaders to grant themselves coercive powers  Friedman s view was also shared by Friedrich Hayek and John Maynard Keynes  both of whom believed that capitalism is vital for freedom to survive and thrive  5  6  Many capitalist critics who   see a key error in communist

Ian Kershaw and Joachim Fest argue that in post World War I Germany  the Nazis were one of many nationalist and fascistic political parties contending for the leadership of Germany s anti communist movement  and of the German state  The Nazis claimed that communism was dangerous to the well being of nations because of its intention to dissolve private property  its support of class conflict  its aggression against the middle class  its hostility to small businessmen  and its atheism  Nazism rejected class conflict based socialism and economic egalitarianism  favouring instead a stratified economy with classes based on merit and talent  retaining private property  and the creation of national solidarity that transcends class distinction  In Europe  numerous aristocrats  conservative intellectuals  capitalists and industrialists lent their support to fascist movements  During the late 1930s and the 1940s  several other anti communist regimes and groups supported Nazism  the

Attorney General Alexander Mitchell Palmer  During the Red Scare  the Lusk Committee investigated those suspected of sedition  and many laws were passed in the US that sanctioned the firings of Communists  First came the Hatch Act of 1939 which was sponsored by Carl Hatch of New Mexico  This law attempted to drive Communism out of public work places  The Hatch Act outlawed the hiring of federal workers who advocated the  overthrow of our Constitutional form of government   This phrase was specifically directed at the Communist Party  Later in the spring of 1941 another anti communist

rise of the Soviet Union  many anti communists in the United States feared that Communism would triumph throughout the entire world and eventually be a direct threat to the US government  This fear led to the domino theory  which stated that a Communist takeover in any nation could not be tolerated because it would lead to a chain reaction that would result in worldwide Communism  There were fears that powerful Communist states such as the Soviet Union and the People s Republic of China were using their power to forcibly assimilate other countries into Communist rule  The Soviet Union s expansion into central Europe after World War II was seen as evidence of this  The US policy of halting further Communist expansion came to be known as containment  This period  up to 1957  is known as the Second Red Scare  The deepening of the Cold War in the 1950s saw a dramatic increase in anti communism in the United States  including the anti communist campaign known as McCarthyism  Thousands of Americans  such as the filmmaker Charlie Chaplin  were accused of being Communists or sympathizers  and many became the subject of aggressive investigations by government committees such as the House Committee on Un American Activities  As a result of sometimes vastly exaggerated accusations  many of the accused lost their jobs and became blacklisted  although most of these verdicts were later overturned  This was also the period of the McCarran Internal Security Act and the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg trial  After the collapse of the Soviet Union many records were made public that in fact verified that many of those thought to be falsely accused for political purposes were in fact Communist spies or sympathizers  see Venona Project   During the 1980s  the Ronald Reagan administration pursued an aggressive policy against the Soviet Union and its allies by building up weapons programs  including the Strategic Defense Initiative  The Reagan Doctrine was implemented to reduce the influence of the Soviet Union worldwide by providing aid to anti Soviet resistance movements  including the Contras in Nicaragua and the Mujahideens in Afghanistan  The accidental downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 near Moneron Island by the Soviets on Sept  1  1983 contributed to the anti communism propaganda of the 1980s  KAL 007 had been carrying 269 people  including a sitting U S  Congressman  Larry McDonald  Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher The US government usually argued its anti communist policies by citing the human rights record of communist states  most notably the Soviet Union during the Joseph Stalin era  Maoist China  North Korea  and the Pol Pot led Khmer Rouge government and the pro Hanoi People s Republic of Kampuchea in Cambodia  During the 1980s  the Kirkpatrick Doctrine was particularly influential in American politics  it advocated US support of anti communist governments around the world  including authoritarian regimes  Anti communism became significantly muted after the fall of the Soviet Union and Eastern bloc Communist governments in Europe between 1989 and 1991  the fear of a worldwide Communist takeover was no longer a serious concern  Remnants of anti communism remain  however  in US foreign policy toward Cuba and North Korea  In the case of Cuba  the US continues to maintain economic sanctions against the country  Tensions with North Korea have heightened as the result of reports that it is stockpiling nuclear weapons  and the assertion that it is willing to sell its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology to any group willing to pay a high enough price  Much of the US foreign policy establishment does not regard the People s Republic of China as communist in any meaningful sense  citation needed  Nevertheless  there is some hostility toward the Chinese government  particularly among conservative Congressional Republicans  For example  national security issues were raised during Chinese state owned CNOOC Ltd  s takeover bid for Unocal  an American energy firm  citation needed   edit  Vietnam The neutrality of this section is disputed  Please see the discussion on the talk page  Please do not remove this message until the dispute is resolved   April 2010  In Vietnam  anti communist movements  including those from pro democracy and pro human rights groups  had largely been limited before the advent of the Internet  This was due to repression of dissidents as well as the Vietnamese government s efforts in censorship and propaganda regarding foreign and domestic policies  including examination of personal mails  especially those sent from overseas   and a heavy censorship of foreign media broadcasts  Prior to the arrival of the Internet  much of the global anti communist activities directed towards Vietnam were religious in nature  Clerical North American and European organizations voiced concerns about religious oppressions  Of particular robustness were the organizations of Monsignor Tran Van Hoai  the first Director of the Vatican s Center of Pastoral Apostolate for Overseas Vietnamese  In recent years  there have been many Vietnamese bloggers who  with the aid of the World Wide Web  have disseminated information critical of Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnamese government s relations with the People s Republic of China  the most controversial of which are deals struck between the two communist countries  leaders  such as territorial claims of islands in the South China Sea  These have sparked intense nationalism and led to much outrage felt even on the part of many Vietnamese themselves  The culmination of the sentiments can be seen in many recent protests held in both former North Vietnam s capital Hanoi and former South Vietnam s capital Saigon  Frequent arrests of some democracy advocates by the government have also led to activism among many Vietnamese who demand an release of all political dissidents as well as greater clarity in their trials  Recently  there have also been protests against the government blocking access to free networking and blogging services such as Facebook  Wordpress  as well as calls for a unified effort in boycotting government sanctioned blogging services like the so called  Yahoo  Vi t Nam 360plus    edit  See also Anti communists Anti Stalinist left The Black Book of Communism Charter 08 Chinese
