York is bordered by New Jersey and Pennsylvania to the south  and by Connecticut  Massachusetts and Vermont to the east  The state has a maritime border with Rhode Island east of Long Island  as well as an international border with the Canadian provinces of Ontario to the west and north  and Quebec to the north  The state of New York is often referred to as New York State to distinguish it from New York City  New York City  with a population of over 8 1 million  is the most populous city in the United States  It is known for its status as a center for finance and culture and for its status as the largest gateway for immigration to the United States  According to the U S  Department of Commerce  it is also a destination of choice for many foreign visitors  Both the state and city were named for the 17th century Duke of York  James Stuart  future James II and VII of England and Scotland  New York was inhabited by various tribes of Algonquian and Iroquoian speaking Native American tribes at the time Dutch settlers moved into the region in the early 17th century  In 1609  the region was first claimed by Henry Hudson for the Dutch  Fort Nassau was built near the site of the present day capital of Albany in 1614  The Dutch soon also settled New Amsterdam and parts of the Hudson River Valley  establishing the colony of New Netherland  The British took over the colony by annexation in 1664  The borders of the British colony  the Province of New York  were roughly similar to those of the present day state  About one third of all the battles of the Revolutionary War took place in New York  The state constitution was enacted in 1777  New York became the 11th state to ratify the United States Constitution  on July 26  1788  Contents 1 History 1 1 17th century 1 2

Further reading 12 External links History Main article  History of New York 17th century See also  Province of New York Henry Hudson s 1609 voyage marked the beginning of the European involvement with that area  Sailing for the Dutch East India Company and looking for a passage to Asia  he entered the Upper New York Bay on September 11 of that year  After his return word of his findings quickly spread and Dutch merchants began to explore the coast in search for profitable fur trade  During the 17th century  Dutch trading posts established for the trade of pelts from the Lenape  Iroquois and other indigenous peoples expanded into the colony of New Netherland  The first of these trading posts were Fort Nassau  1614  near present day Albany   Fort Orange  1624  on the Hudson River just south of the current city of Albany and created to replace Fort Nassau   developing into settlement Beverwijck  1647   and into what became Albany  Fort Amsterdam  1625  to develop into the town New Amsterdam which is present day New York City   and Esopus   1653  now Kingston   The success of the patroonship of Rensselaerswyck  1630   which surrounded Albany and lasted until the mid 19th century  was also a key factor in the early success of the colony  The English captured the colony during the Second Anglo Dutch War and governed it as the Province of New York  The city of New York was recaptured by the Dutch once again in 1673 during the Third Anglo Dutch War  1672 1674  and renamed New Orange  but returned to the English under the terms of the Treaty of Westminster a year later   7  American Revolution New York in 1777 The Sons of Liberty were organized in New York City during the 1760s  largely in response to the oppressive Stamp Act passed by the British Parliament in 1765  The Stamp Act Congress met in the city on October 19 of that year  a gathering of representatives from across the Thirteen Colonies that set the stage for the Continental Congress to follow  The Stamp Act Congress resulted in the Declaration of Rights and Grievances  which was the first written expression by representatives of the Americans of many of the rights and complaints later expressed in the United States Declaration of Independence  including the right to representative government  The Capture of Fort Ticonderoga provided the cannon and gunpowder necessary to force a British withdrawal from the Siege of Boston in 1775  New York endorsed the Declaration of Independence on July 9  1776  8  The New York state constitution was framed by a convention which assembled at White Plains  New York on July 10  1776  and after repeated adjournments and changes of location  terminated its labors at Kingston  New York on Sunday evening  April 20  1777  when the new constitution drafted by John Jay was adopted with but one dissenting vote  It was not submitted to the people for ratification  On July 30  1777  George Clinton was inaugurated as the first Governor of New York at Kingston  The first major battle of the American Revolutionary War after independence was declared and the largest battle of the entire war was fought in New York at the Battle of Long Island  a k a Battle of Brooklyn  in August 1776  British victory made New York City their military and political base of operations in North America for the duration of the conflict  and consequently the center of attention for General George Washington s intelligence network  The notorious British prison ships of Wallabout Bay saw more American combatants die of intentional neglect than were killed in combat in every battle of the war  combined  The first of two major British armies were captured by the Continental Army at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777  influencing France to ally with the revolutionaries  In an attempt to retain their sovereignty and remain an independent nation positioned between the new United States and British North America  four of the Iroquois nations fought on the side of the British  only the Oneidas and their dependents the Tuscaroras allied themselves to the Americans  9  The Sullivan Expedition of 1778 and 1779 destroyed nearly 50 Iroquois villages and adjacent croplands  forcing many refugees to British held Niagara  10  As allies of the British  the Iroquois were resettled in Canada after the war  In the treaty settlement  the British ceded most Indian lands to the new United States  Because New York made treaty with the Iroquois without getting Congressional approval  some of the land purchases are the subject of modern day claims by the individual tribes  More than 5 million acres  20 000 km2  of former Iroquois territory was put up for sale in the years after the Revolutionary War  leading to rapid development in upstate New York  11  As per the Treaty of Paris  the last vestige of British authority in the former Thirteen Colonies their troops in New York City departed in 1783  which was long afterwards celebrated as Evacuation Day  12  Following heated debate  which included the publication of the now quintessential constitutional interpretation the Federalist Papers as a series of installments in New York City newspapers  New York was the 11th state to ratify the United States Constitution  on July 26  1788  13  19th century The creation of the Erie Canal led to rapid industrialization in New York  Transportation in western New York was difficult before canals were built in the early part of the 19th century  The Hudson and Mohawk Rivers could be navigated only as far as Central New York  While the St  Lawrence River could be navigated to Lake Ontario  the way westward to the other Great Lakes was blocked by Niagara Falls  and so the only route to western New York was over land  Governor DeWitt Clinton strongly advocated building a canal to connect the Hudson River with Lake Erie  and thus all the Great Lakes  Work commenced in 1817  and the Erie Canal was finished in 1825  It was considered an engineering marvel  Packet boats traveled up and down the canal with sightseers and visitors on board  14  The canal opened up vast areas of New York to commerce and settlement  It enabled Great Lakes port cities such as Buffalo and Rochester to grow and prosper  It also connected the burgeoning agricultural production of the Midwest and shipping on the Great Lakes  with the port of New York City  Improving transportation  it enabled additional population migration to territories west of New York  Ellis Island Main article  Ellis Island Scenes at the Immigration Depot and a nearby dock on Ellis Island Ellis Island in 1905 Ellis Island was the main facility for immigrants  entering the United States in the late 19th century to the mid 20th century  It was opened when the federal government took over the responsibility for processing immigrants  prior to that it was the responsibility of the states  It replaced the prior New York State immigration center located at Castle Clinton  a War of 1812 era fort located in what is today Battery Park  through which at least 8 million immigrants such as Harry Houdini  passed through from 1855 1890  15  Ellis Island operated as an immigration center from January 1  1892  until November 12  1954  It is owned by the Federal government and is now part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument  under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service  It is situated in New York Harbor  between two states and cities  Jersey City  New Jersey and New York City  New York  More than 12 million immigrants passed through Ellis Island  between 1892 and 1954  After 1924  when the National Origins Act was passed  the only immigrants to pass through there were displaced persons or war refugees  16  Today  over 100 million Americans can trace their ancestry to the immigrants  who first arrived in America through Castle Clinton and Ellis Island  before dispersing to points all over the country  Ellis Island was the subject of a border dispute between New York State and New Jersey  The issue was settled in 1998 by the U S  Supreme Court which ruled that the original 3 3 acre island was New York State territory and that the balance of the 27 5 acres  11 ha  added after 1834 by landfill was in New Jersey  Statue of Liberty Main article  Statue of Liberty Statue of Liberty The Statue of Liberty was a gift from France to the United States to mark the Centennial of the American Declaration of Independence  The idea of giving a colossal representation of republican virtues to a  sister  republic  across the sea  served as a focus for the republican cause against other politicians  The Statue of Liberty was dedicated in New York Harbor on October 28  1886  Liberty Island closed on September 11  2001  the island reopened in December  the monument reopened on August 3  2004  but the statue remained closed until the summer of 2009  The National Park Service claims that the statue is not shut because of a terrorist threat  but principally because of a long list of fire regulation contraventions  including inadequate evacuation procedures  The museum and ten story pedestal are open for visitors  but are only accessible if visitors have a  Monument Access Pass   which is a reservation that visitors must make in advance of their visit and pick up before boarding the ferry  There are a maximum of 3000 passes available each day  with a total of 15 000 visitors to the island daily  The interior of the statue remains closed  although a glass ceiling in the pedestal allows for views of Gustave Eiffel s iron framework of Lady Liberty  Geography Main article  Geography of New York New York terrain  Map of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers  New York covers 54 556 square miles  141 300 km2  and ranks as the 27th largest state by size  2  The Great Appalachian Valley dominates eastern New York  while Lake Champlain is the chief northern feature of the valley  which also includes the Hudson River flowing southward to the Atlantic Ocean  The rugged Adirondack Mountains  with vast tracts of wilderness  lie west of the valley  Most of the southern part of the state is on the Allegheny Plateau  which rises from the southeast to the Catskill Mountains  The western section of the state is drained by the Allegheny River and rivers of the Susquehanna and Delaware systems  The Delaware River Basin Compact  signed in 1961 by New York  New Jersey  Pennsylvania  Delaware  and the federal government  regulates the utilization of water of the Delaware system  The highest elevation in New York is Mount Marcy in the Adirondacks  17  New York s borders touch  clockwise from the west  two Great Lakes  Erie and Ontario  which are connected by the Niagara River   the provinces of Ontario and Quebec in Canada  Lake Champlain  three New England states  Vermont  Massachusetts  and Connecticut   the Atlantic Ocean  and two Mid Atlantic States  New Jersey and Pennsylvania  In addition  Rhode Island shares a water border with New York  New York is the only state that touches both the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean  and is the second largest of the original Thirteen Colonies  In contrast with New York City s urban atmosphere  the vast majority of the state is dominated by farms  forests  rivers  mountains  and lakes  New York s Adirondack Park is the largest state park in the United States  It is larger than the Yellowstone  Yosemite  Grand Canyon  Glacier and Olympic National Parks combined  18  New York established the first state park in the United States at Niagara Falls in 1885  Niagara Falls  on the Niagara River as it flows from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario  is a popular attraction  The Hudson River begins at Lake Tear of the Clouds and flows south through the eastern part of the state without draining Lakes George or Champlain  Lake George empties at its north end into Lake Champlain  whose northern end extends into Canada  where it drains into the Richelieu and then the St  Lawrence Rivers  Four of New York City s five boroughs are on three islands at the mouth of the Hudson River  Manhattan Island  Staten Island  and Long Island  which contains Brooklyn and Queens on its western end  Upstate and downstate are often used informally to distinguish New York City or its greater metropolitan area from the rest of New York State  The placement of a boundary between the two is a matter of great contention  19  Unofficial and loosely defined regions of Upstate New York include the Southern Tier  which often includes the counties along the border with Pennsylvania  20  and the North Country  which can mean anything from the strip along the Canadian border to everything north of the Mohawk River  21  Climate Main article  Climate of New York Lake effect snow is a major contributor to snowfall totals in western New York  In general  New York has a humid continental climate  though under the K ppen climate classification  New York City has a humid subtropical climate  22  Weather in New York is heavily influenced by two continental air masses  a warm  humid one from the southwest and a cold  dry one from the northwest  The winters are long and cold in the Plateau Divisions of the state  In the majority of winter seasons  a temperature of  13  F   25  C  or lower can be expected in the northern highlands  Northern Plateau  and 5  F   15  C  or colder in the southwestern and east central highlands  Southern Plateau   The summer climate is cool in the Adirondacks  Catskills and higher elevations of the Southern Plateau  The New York City Long Island area and lower portions of the Hudson Valley have rather warm summers by comparison  with some periods of high  uncomfortable humidity  The remainder of New York State enjoys pleasantly warm summers  marred by only occasional  brief intervals of sultry conditions  Summer daytime temperatures usually range from the upper 70s to mid 80s  F  25 to 30  C   over much of the state  New York ranks 46th among the 50 states in the amount of greenhouse gases generated per person  This relative efficiency is primarily due to the state s higher rate of mass transit use  23  Monthly Normal High and Low Temperatures

York State Office of Parks  Recreation and Historic Preservation Two major parks in the state are the Adirondack Park and Catskill Park  New York has many state parks and two major forest preserves  Adirondack Park  roughly the size of the state of Vermont and the largest state park in the United States  was established in 1892 and given state constitutional protection to remain  forever wild  in 1894  The thinking that led to the creation of the Park first appeared in George Perkins Marsh s Man and Nature  published in 1864  Marsh argued that deforestation could lead to desertification  referring to the clearing of once lush lands surrounding the Mediterranean  he asserted  the operation of causes set in action by man has brought the face of the earth to a desolation almost as complete as that of the moon   The Catskill Park was protected in legislation passed in 1885  25  which declared that its land was to be conserved and never put up for sale or lease  Consisting of 700 000 acres  2 800 km2  of land  25  the park is a habitat for bobcats  minks and fishers  There are some 400 black bears living in the region  The state operates numerous campgrounds and there are over 300 miles  480 km  of multi use trails in the Park  The Montauk Point State Park boasts the 1797 Montauk Lighthouse  commissioned under President George Washington  which is a major tourist attraction on the easternmost tip of Long Island  Hither Hills park offers camping and is a popular destination with surfcasting sport fishermen  Counties Map of the counties in New York Main article  List of

is very urban  with 92  of residents living in an urban area  31  New York is a slow growing state with a large rate of domestic migration to other states  In 2000 and 2005  more people moved from New York to Florida than from any one state to another  32  However  New York State is one of the leading destinations for international immigration and thus has the second largest immigrant population in the country  after California  at 4 2 million as of 2008  Although Upstate New York receives considerable immigration  most of the state s immigrants settle in and around New York City  due to its more vibrant economy and cosmopolitan culture  The center of population of New York is located in Orange County  in the town of Deerpark  33  New York City and its eight suburban counties  excluding those in New Jersey  Connecticut  and Pennsylvania  have a combined population of 13 209 006 people  or 68 42  of the state s population  34  Racial and ancestral makeup New York population ethnicity
