arose from a humorous drawing sketched out by Kevin Eastman during a casual evening of brainstorming with his friend Peter Laird  3  Using money from a tax refund together with a loan from Eastman s uncle  the young artists self published a single issue comic intended to parody four of the most popular comics of the early 1980s  Marvel Comics  Daredevil and New Mutants  Dave Sim s Cerebus  and Frank Miller s Ronin  4  Much of the Turtles  mainstream success began when a licensing agent  Mark Freedman  sought out Eastman and Laird to propose wider merchandising opportunities for the offbeat property  In 1986  Dark Horse Miniatures produced a set of 15 mm lead figurines  In January 1987  they visited the offices of Playmates Toys Inc  a small California toy company who wished to expand into the action figure market  Development initiated with a creative team of companies and individuals  Jerry Sachs  ad man of Sachs Finley Agency  brought together the animators at Murakami Wolf Swenson  headed by award winning animator Fred Wolf  Wolf and his team combined concepts and ideas with Playmates marketing crew  headed by Karl Aaronian and then VP of Sales  Richard Sallis and VP of Playmates  Bill Carlson  Aaronian brought on several designers and concepteer and writer John Schulte and worked out the simple backstory that would live on toy packaging for the entire run of the product and show  Sachs called the high concept pitch  Green Against Brick   The sense of humor was honed with the collaboration of MWS s writers  Playmates and their team essentially served as associate producers and contributing writers to the miniseries that was first launched to sell in the toy action figures  Phrases like  Heroes in a Half Shell  and many of the comical catch phrases and battle slogans   Turtle Power    came from the writing and conceptualization of this creative team  As the series developed  veteran writer Jack Mendelsohn came on board as both a story editor and scriptwriter  David Wise  Michael Charles Hill  and Michael Reaves wrote most of the scripts  taking input via Mendelsohn and collaborating writer Schulte and marketing maven Aaronian  citation needed  The miniseries was repeated three times before it found an audience  Once the product started selling  the show got syndicated and picked up and backed by Group W  which funded the next round of animation  The show then went network  on CBS  Accompanied by the popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1987 TV series  and the subsequent action figure line  the TMNT were soon catapulted into pop culture history  At the height of the frenzy  in the late 1980s and early 1990s  the Turtles  likenesses could be found on a wide range of children s merchandise  from Pez dispensers to skateboards  breakfast cereal  video games  school supplies  linens  towels  cameras  and even toy shaving kits  On October 21  2009 it was announced that cable channel Nickelodeon  a subsidiary of Viacom  had purchased all of Mirage s rights to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles property  Mirage retains the rights to publish 18 issues a year  though the future involvement of Mirage with the Turtles and the future of Mirage Studios itself is unknown  5  Nickelodeon plans to develop a new CGI animated TMNT television series and will partner with fellow Viacom company Paramount Pictures to bring a new TMNT movie to theaters  Both are expected to debut in 2012  6   edit  Main characters For supporting characters see List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters Leonardo  Leo    The courageous leader

Turtles  Mirage Studios  The cover of TMNT  1 Eastman and Laird s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles premiered in May  1984  at a comic book convention held at a local Sheraton Hotel in Portsmouth  New Hampshire  It was published by Mirage Studios in an oversized magazine style format using black  amp  white artwork on cheap newsprint  limited to a print run of only 3 000 copies  8  Through a clever media kit that included an ad placed in Comic Buyer s Guide  545  the public s interest was piqued and thus began the Turtle phenomenon  The small print runs made these early comics and trade magazines instant collector items  and within months they were trading for over fifty times their cover price  The name  Mirage Studios  was chosen because of Eastman and Laird s lack of a professional art studio at the start of their career  before their creation made them both multi millionaires  Mirage also published a bi monthly companion book entitled Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  featuring art by Ryan Brown and Jim Lawson  which was designed to fill in the gaps of continuity in the TMNT universe  This put the original series and Tales in the same mainstream continuity  and the two are thus canon to each other  The title s first volume was from 1987 1989  released in alternating months with the regular Eastman and Laird book  All seven issues of Volume One have been collected in trade paperback form twice  and twenty five issues of Volume Two have been collected in trades of five issues each  As the TMNT phenomenon proliferated to other media  Eastman and Laird would find themselves administrating an international merchandising juggernaut  However  this prevented the two creators from participating in the day to day work of writing and illustrating a monthly comic book  For this reason  many guest artists were invited to showcase their unique talents in the TMNT universe  The breadth of diversity found in the various short stories gave the series a disjointed  anthology like feel  Fans stuck with the series  and what was originally intended as a one shot became a continuing series that lasted for 104 issues spanning four separate volumes  In June  1996  Image Comics revived the title in what is considered  Volume 3  of the comics  It was a slightly more action oriented TMNT series and although notable for inflicting major physical changes on the main characters  Peter Laird  co creator of the TMNT  has said this volume is no longer in canon as he began publishing Volume 4 at Mirage Publishing  As an explanation  he offered in the pages of Volume 4 s letter column   It just didn t feel right   After taking back the series from Image Comics  Mirage Studios resumed publication of a fourth volume in December  2001  under the simple title TMNT  After the publication of issue  28  writer Peter Laird placed the series on an eight month hiatus to devote himself to production of the recent TMNT movie  However  after that eight months had passed Mirage s official website went on to list the series as in  indefinite hiatus   In January 2008 Mirage had finally confirmed that the series would return in May 2008  Issues 29 and 30 had a limited printing of 1 000 copies each  and were available through the official TMNT website  Although the purchase agreement with Nickelodeon allows Laird to produce up to 18 comics a year set in the original Mirage continuity  no new material has been released since the sale  In April 2011  IDW Publishing announced that they had acquired the license to publish new collections of Mirage storylines and a new ongoing series  9  The first issue of the new series was release on August 24  2011  Turtles co creator Kevin Eastman and Tom Waltz write  with Eastman and Dan Duncan handling art chores  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures was a comic book series published from August 1988 to October 1995 by Archie Comics  The initial storylines were close adaptations of the 1987 TV series  but with the fifth issue Eastman and Laird decided to hand the series over to Mirage Studios employees Ryan Brown and Stephen Murphy who immediately abandoned the animated series adaptations and took the title in a decidedly different direction with all new original adventures  In 1989  Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird created a special three issue series of full color mini comics for the Ralston Purina Company  These comics were offered for kids to collect and were only available as premiums in boxes of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cereal  A monthly comic inspired by the 2003 TV series was published by Dreamwave Productions from June to December 2003  It was written by Peter David and illustrated by LeSean Thomas  In the first four issues  which were the only ones directly adapted from the TV series  the story was told from the perspectives of April  Baxter  Casey  and a pair of NYC cops  instead of the Turtles  The Turtles have also appeared in many manga series  Mutant Turtles                My tanto T toruzu   was a 15 issue series by Tsutomu Oyamada  Zuki mora  and Yoshimi Hamada that simply adapted episodes of the original American animated series  Super Turtles            S p  T toruzu  was a three issue miniseries by Hidemasa Idemitsu  Tetsur  Kawade  and Toshio Kud  that featured the  TMNT Supermutants  Turtle toys that were on sale at the time  The first volume of Japan s anime miniseries followed this storyline  Next was Mutant Turtles Gaiden                  My tanto T toruzu Gaiden   by Hiroshi Kanno  which was a re interpretation of the Turtles story with no connection to the previous manga  Also of note was Mutant Turtles III  an adaptation of the third feature film by Yasuhiko Hachino  A daily comic strip written and illustrated by Dan Berger featured an adventure story Monday through Friday and activity puzzles on weekends  with fan art appearing later   The comic strip was published in syndication until its cancellation in December  1996  At its highest point in popularity  it was published in over 250 newspapers   edit  Television series  edit  First animated series  1987 1996  Main article  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  1987 TV series  The TMNT logo of the 1987 animated series  When little known Playmates Toys Inc  was approached about producing a TMNT action figure line  they were cautious of the risk and requested that a television deal be acquired first  10  11  On December 28  1987  the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  first cartoon series began  starting as a 5 part miniseries and becoming a regular Saturday morning syndicated series on October 1  1988 with 13 more episodes  The series was produced by Murakami Wolf Swenson Film Productions Inc  later Fred Wolf Films   Mirage Studios does not own the rights to this cartoon series  The show places a much stronger emphasis on humor than the comics do  Here  the Ninja Turtles are portrayed as four wise cracking  pizza obsessed superheroes who fight the forces of evil from their sewer hideout  and make their first appearance in masks color coded to each turtle  where previously they had all worn red  12  The cast included new and different characters like Bebop and Rocksteady and the Neutrinos  Original characters like Splinter  Shredder  and the Foot Soldiers stayed true to the comics in appearance and alignment only  Instead of being Hamato Yoshi s mutated pet rat  Splinter was a mutated Hamato himself  The Foot Soldiers changed from human ninja to an endless supply of robotic grunts  allowing large numbers of them to be destroyed without anyone dying  this was a very important decision in terms of the show s child audience  excessive violence would have alienated parents of children  the show s target demographic   Krang  one of the series  most memorable villains  was inspired by the design of the Utrom  a benign alien race from the Mirage comics  The animated Krang  however  was instead an evil warlord from Dimension X  Baxter Stockman  whose race was changed from black to white either due to apprehension toward depicting a villanous African American character in a children s cartoon or that for Shredder to boss around a black Stockman would be perceived as racist  Either way  Stockman was rewritten as a shy and meek lackey to Shredder  later mutating into an anthropomorphic housefly  During the final two seasons of the show  in order to combat the rising popularity of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers  the lead villain switched to Lord Dregg  an evil alien overlord bent on world conquest by trying to distract the public into believing that the Turtles were the enemy instead of himself  Starting on September 25  1989  the series was expanded to weekdays and had 47 more episodes for the new Season  There were 28 new syndicated episodes for Season 4 and only 13 of those episodes aired in 1990  The  European Vacation  episodes were not seen in the United States until USA Network started showing reruns in late 1993 and the  Awesome Easter  episodes were not seen until 1991  These episodes were delayed because of animation or schedule problems  13  On April 21  1990 a drug prevention television special was broadcast on ABC  NBC  and CBS named Cartoon All Stars to the Rescue that featured some of the most popular cartoons at the time  representing TMNT was Michelangelo  voiced by Townsend Coleman  The turtles are also well known for their use of idiomatic expressions characteristic of the surfer lingo of the time  especially by Michelangelo  Words and phrases  such as  bummer    dude    bogus    radical    far out    tubuloso    bodacious   and possibly the most recognized   cowabunga   14  Starting on September 8  1990  with a different opening sequence   the show began its run on CBS  The CBS weekend edition ran for a full hour up until 1994  initially airing a couple of Saturday exclusive episodes back to back  There would also be a brief  Turtle Tips  segment in between the two episodes which served as PSA about the environment or other issues  After 1994  the show was reduced to just a half hour and produced only 8 episodes per season  grouped into a  CBS Action Zone  block that also featured WildC A T s  and Skeleton Warriors  both of which was cancelled after their one season though TMNT retained its  Action Zone  pre intro  The two shows in the block were also produced by Fred Wolf Films  The series ran until November 2  1996 when it aired its final episode  Its enormous popularity gave rise to its numerous imitators  including the Battletoads  Cheetahmen  Wild West C O W  Boys of Moo Mesa  Stone Protectors  Street Sharks  Extreme Dinosaurs  and Biker Mice from Mars  Currently  178 episodes are available on DVD   edit  Live action series  1997 1998  The Ninja Turtles  The Next Mutation logo  Main article  Ninja Turtles  The Next Mutation In 1997 1998  the Turtles starred in a live action television series called Ninja Turtles  The Next Mutation that follows the events of the movies  A fifth turtle was introduced  a female named  Venus de Milo  who was skilled in the mystical arts of the shinobi  12  The series seemed to be a loose continuation of the movie franchise  as Shredder had been defeated and the Ninja Turtles encountered new villains  Other connections to the feature films include the fact that Splinter s ear was cut  the Foot Soldiers were humans  and the Turtles lived in the abandoned subway station seen in the second and third movies  The Next Mutation Turtles made a guest appearance on Power Rangers in Space  15  It was canceled after one season of twenty six episodes  Since its cancellation  Peter Laird has disavowed the character Venus de Milo  while Kevin Eastman is more open to talk about her  citation needed   edit  Second animated series  2003 2009  The TMNT logo of the 2003 animated series  Main article  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  2003 TV series  In 2003  a new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series produced by 4Kids Entertainment began airing on the  FoxBox  programming block  It later moved to  The CW4Kids  block  The series was co produced by Mirage Studios  16  and Mirage owned one third of the rights to the series  Mirage s significant stake in creative control resulted in a cartoon that hews more closely to the original comics  creating a darker and edgier feel than the 1987 cartoon  but still remaining lighthearted enough to be considered appropriate for children  This series lasted until 2009  ending with a feature length television movie titled Turtles Forever  which was produced in conjunction with the 25th anniversary of the TMNT franchise and featured the Turtles of the 2003 series teaming up with their counterparts from the 1987 series  4Kidstv com featured all the episodes of the series  up until September 2010  As of that date  4Kids no longer owns the license to the show  meaning that it can no longer be viewed at 4Kidstv com  Nickelodeon will soon be airing the show on Nicktoons   edit  Third animated series  2012  The TMNT logo of the 2012 animated series  Main article  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  2012 TV series  Nickelodeon has acquired the global rights to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from the Mirage Group and 4Kids Entertainment  Inc  and have announced that they are moving forward on development on a new CGI animated TMNT television series consisting of at least 26 half hour episodes  17  18  19  and which will show a special sneak peek on March 31  2012 after the 2012 Kids  Choice Awards  20  A teaser for the upcoming 2012 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series is available  21  The video hints at some changes  namely the two Turtles who traditionally carry blunt weapons have had their weapons changed to similar bladed versions  Donatello uses a naginata instead of a bo  and Michelangelo uses a kusarigama instead of nunchaku  At the Nickelodeon Upfront Conference  it was announced that actor Jason Biggs will voice Leonardo and Rob Paulsen  who voiced Raphael in the 1987 series  will now voice Donatello in the upcoming series  22  In June 2011  it was confirmed that Sean Astin would voice Raphael and Greg Cipes would voice Michelangelo  23  On August 8  2011  it was revealed that Mae Whitman will be the voice for April O Neil  In July 2011  it was revealed that Hoon Lee will be the voice of Master Splinter  In October 2011  it was revealed that Kevin Michael Richardson will be the voice of the Shredder   edit  Anime Metal Mutant Raphael Main article  Mutant Turtles  Choujin Densetsu hen In addition to the American series  a Japanese exclusive two episode anime OVA series was made in 1996  titled Mutant Turtles  Choujin Densetsu hen  The OVA was similar in tone to the 1987 TV series and uses the same voices from the Japanese dub of the 1987 TV series  The first episode was made to advertise the TMNT Supermutants toys  It featured the Turtles as superheroes  who gained costumes and superpowers with the use of Mutastones  while Shredder and Bebop and Rocksteady gained supervillain powers with the use of a Dark Mutastone  As with the Super Sentai and Power Rangers franchises  the four Turtles could combine to form the giant Turtle Saint  The second episode was created to advertise the Metal Mutants toys in which the characters gain Saint Seiya esque mystical metal armor that can transform into beasts  The seven Japanese Mutanite stones encased in a magic mirror that control the Metal Beasts are based on the sun  moon  and the Five Elements  citation needed   edit  Feature films Main article  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  film series  The Turtles have featured in four feature films  The first three  produced in the early 90s and released by New Line Cinema  feature live action  with the Turtles played by various actors in costumes featuring animatronic heads  The first live action film was distributed by Golden Harvest overseas  whereas the second and third films were distributed by 20th Century Fox outside North America  The fourth  released in 2007 by Warner Bros   was an all CGI animated film  A new feature film will be released on 25 December 2013 as part of the acquisition of the franchise by Viacom  It was announced on May 27  2010 that Michael Bay s Platinum Dunes production company had landed the rights to the new film  It is expected that Bay  Bradley Fuller and Andrew Form will serve as executive producers  Ninja Turtles will be a co production between Paramount and Nickelodeon  24  However  it will be a reboot film as opposed to another sequel  Reception from fans thus far has been extremely critical  particularly since Michael Bay s revelation that the Turtles will now be aliens  and saying that critical fans needed to  chill   Fan criticism has included comments from Robbie Rist  the voice of Michelangelo from the original movie series  that Bay is  sodomizing  the original movies and causing  the rape of childhood memories   25   edit  Merchandise Among the first licensed products to feature the Ninja Turtles was a pen and paper RPG titled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  amp  Other Strangeness  published by Palladium Books in 1985 and featuring original comics and illustrations by Eastman and Laird themselves  The game features a large list of animals  including pandas and sparrows  that are available as mutant player characters  There were several more titles in this genre  including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures  Truckin  Turtles  Turtles Go Hollywood  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Guide to the Universe  and Transdimensional Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  In 1986  Dark Horse Miniatures in Boise  Idaho produced an attendant set of lead figurines  unlike later incarnations the bandanas on the store s display set were painted all black before the multicolored versions were released to help younger readers distinguish between the four characters other than their weaponry  Palladium allowed the license to lapse in 2000  in part due to declining sales stemming from the  kiddification  of the animated and live action incarnations to that point  However  Palladium s publisher  Kevin Siembieda  has indicated a potential willingness to revisit the license given the franchise s recent moves closer to its roots  26   edit  Toys Main article  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures During the run of the 1987 TV series  Playmates Toys produced hundreds of TMNT action figures  along with vehicles  playsets  and accessories  becoming one of the top collectibles for children  27  Staff artists at Northampton  Massachusetts based Mirage Studios provided conceptual designs for many of the figures  vehicles  and playsets and creator credit can be found in the legal text printed on the back of the toy packaging  The line featured many different variants of the TMNT  such as  Farmer Mike  and  Classic Rocker Leo   In addition  Playmates produced a series of TMNT Star Trek crossover figures  due to Playmates holding the Star Trek action figure license at the time  Playmates employed many design groups to develop looks and styles for the ongoing toy line  including Bloom Design  White Design  Pangea  Robinson Clarke  and McHale Design  Comic reality was maintained by visual artists at each of the firms  creating a wide range of compelling styles  The writing on the packaging came predominately from Pangea and White Design  Ancillary in pack items  like the Turtle Maps and joke books were also wildly popular  All in all  the shows were often inspired by the collaboration of all these visual and written elements coming together  The Marketing VP of Playmates  Karl Aaronian  was largely responsible for assembling the talented team of designers and writers  which in turn  helped germinate continued interest in the toy line  Never before in toy history did an action figure line have such an impact for over two decades  generating billions of dollars in licensing revenue  The series was highly popular in the UK where  in the run up to Christmas  the Army  amp  Navy Store in London s Lewisham devoted its entire basement to everything Turtle  including games  videos  costumes  and other items  Playmates continue to produce TMNT action figures based on the 2003 animated series  The 2007 film  TMNT  also gave Playmates a new source from which to make figures  And in September 2007  NECA announced that they would produce figures based on character designs from the original Mirage comics  As of April 2008 there have been toys released of the four turtles with their weapons  a piece of an interhooking platform  a can of ooze  an unmutated turtle toy  and two alternate hands  It features a detailed color design job as well as 20 points of articulation  August 2008  NECA announced a second wave  featuring Shredder  Casey Jones  and a Foot Soldier  but the future of the NECA line is unknown with Playmates releasing 25th anniversary TMNT toys  There will also be a new TMNT toy line for the new series and classic series in 2012  Images of the new toy line and a new classic toy line have been released  There will also be a new TMNT play set released  too   edit  Video games Main article  List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video games The first Famicom NES TMNT game was the single player Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  released by Konami Ultra in 1989  It was unique in that at any point  the player could switch from one turtle to the next to take advantage of each Turtle s strengths  In addition  the player starts off in a strategic map where the player may explore sewer holes as well as engage patrolling enemy foot soldiers before entering any in game portals  The game was also released on the many home computers  but these conversions were hastily made and got negative reviews  Years later the game was released for the Wii on the Virtual Console  Also released by Konami in 1989 was the first TMNT arcade game  also titled simply Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  This side scrolling  beat  em up  was ported to the NES as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II  The Arcade Game  This led to an NES only sequel  entitled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III  The Manhattan Project  which used the look of the arcade game  as opposed the first NES game  The next Turtles console game  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  Turtles in Time  was released in 1991 as an arcade game  and was later ported to the Super Nintendo in 1992  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  The Hyperstone Heist was also created for the Sega Genesis in the same year  and used many of the art assets from TMNT IV  There was also a trilogy of TMNT video games for the original Game Boy system made by Konami  consisting of  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  Fall of the Foot Clan  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II  Back from the Sewers  and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III  Radical Rescue  As the video game series progressed  programmers began to incorporate unique signature moves for each Turtle  as well as game features such as  Versus mode  and  Time Attack mode   When the Ninja Turtles  popularity began to decline in the mid nineties  the video games changed direction  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  Tournament Fighters was released as a one on one fighting game similar to the Street Fighter series  It is of note that  whilst this game would see release on both the Mega Drive Genesis and Super Nintendo consoles using similar art assets  the games are essentially different  a common occurrence for 16 bit licensed titles of the era  such as Disney s Aladdin   Konami also acquired the license to adapt the 2003 TV series into a video game franchise  resulting in a new series of games with the same button mashing gameplay as the old TMNT  beat  em ups   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  2003 video game   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2  Battle Nexus  and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3  Mutant Nightmare   In 2006  Ubisoft acquired the rights of TMNT games  beginning with a game based on the 2007 animated feature film  28  A beat  em up  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  Arcade Attack  was released for the DS in November 2009  to coincide with the series  25th anniversary  29   edit  In other media  edit  Food tie ins Main article  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles food tie ins During the height of their popularity  1987 1996  the Turtles had a number of food tie ins  30  Among the most notable of these products was Ninja Turtles Cereal  produced by Ralston Purina as a kind of  Chex with TMNT themed marshmallows  which also came with a small pouch of Pizza Crunchabungas  pizza flavored corn snacks in the shape of pizzas  the commercial starred the Ninja Turtles as Will Vinton created claymations   Hostess Ninja Turtles Pudding Pies  featuring a green sugar crust and vanilla pudding inside  and Royal OOZE Gelatin Desserts  distributed by Nabisco under  Royal Gelatin  in three different flavors  orange  strawberry  and lime  Shreddies used to give out TMNT toys in their boxes when the cereal advertising was still geared toward children  One example of a TMNT prize was rings featuring a character on the cartoon  1992   There was also green Ninja Turtle ice cream with different toppings according to which turtle flavour one ordered  Chef Boyardee also released a canned pasta with the pasta in the shapes of the four turtles themselves  31   edit  Concert tour To further add to the Turtles  popularity  a concert tour was held in 1990  premiering at Radio City Music Hall  32  33  The  Coming Out of Their Shells  tour featured live action turtles playing music as a band  Donatello  keyboards  Leonardo  bass guitar  Raphael  drums  amp  sax  Michelangelo  guitar  on stage around a familiar plotline  April O Neil is kidnapped by the Shredder  the turtles have to rescue her  34  The story had a very Bill n  Ted esque feel  with its theme of the power of rock n  roll literally defeating the enemy  in the form of the Shredder  who only rapped about how he hates music  trying to eliminate all music  A pay per view special highlighting the concert was shown  and a studio album was also released  Stylistically  the music s genre was closest to hair metal power rock  35  The track listing is as follows   Coming Out of Our Shells    Sing About It   Tubin    Skipping Stones   Pizza Power   Walk Straight   No Treaties   Cowabunga   April Ballad   Count on Us  Since the tour was sponsored by Pizza Hut in real life  there are many references to their pizza  Empty Pizza Hut boxes are seen onscreen during the  Behind The Shells  VHS  As part of a cross marketing strategy  Pizza Hut restaurants gave away posters  audio cassettes of  Coming Out of Their Shells   and  Official Tour Guides  as premiums  The original show of the tour was released on video with a making of video also released  The song  Pizza Power  was later used by Konami for the second arcade game Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  Turtles in Time   edit  At the Disney MGM Studios Theme Park The TMNT as they appeared at Disney MGM Studios  On June 30  1990 the TMNT appeared in the  New York Street  section of Disney MGM Studios theme park in Orlando  Emerging from their Turtle Party Wagon  they would  ninja dance  across the stage while April performed the theme song to the show  After the main show was done they would pose for pictures and sign autographs  The Turtles made appearances in Walt Disney s  Very Merry Christmas Parade  to sing their own rendition of  Santa Claus is Coming to Town   They also appeared during the Easter parade dancing to their single  Pizza Power   The Turtles  live shows and appearances ceased production in 1996   edit  Parodies Cover of Cracked  255  Aug 1990 Although the TMNT had originated as something of a parody  the comic s explosive success led to a wave of small press  black  amp  white comic parodies of TMNT itself  including Adolescent Radioactive Black Belt Hamsters  Pre Teen Dirty Gene Kung Fu Kangaroos  and a host of others  Dark Horse Comics  Boris the Bear was launched in response to these TMNT clones  its first issue was titled  Boris the Bear Slaughters the Teenage Radioactive Black Belt Mutant Ninja Critters   Once the Turtles broke into the mainstream  parodies also proliferated in other media  such as in satire magazines Cracked and MAD Magazine and numerous TV series of the period   edit  Controversy  edit  Departure from origins In keeping with the  grim  n gritty  feel to parody Frank Miller s Ronin Elektra material  the Turtles engaged in a greater amount of overt violence in the pages of the early Mirage comic book series by Eastman and Laird  As the TMNT were introduced into the mainstream  they were radically redesigned for a younger audience in the children s spinoff universes beginning with the first cartoon  In issue  19 of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  the creators published an editorial addressing any possible concerns of readers as a result of this  It stated  in part   We ve allowed the wacky side to happen  and enjoy it very much  All the while  though  we ve kept the originals very much ours   forty pages of what we enjoy and want to see in our books  whether it comes from our own hands or from those of the talented people we work with   36  In the film Turtles Forever  the original Mirage Turtles refer to their descendents as  sell outs   in reference to their colorful accessories  the originals are conveyed in black and white    edit  Teenage Mutant  Hero  Turtles The title screen from the TMHT version  altered due to censorship  Upon TMNT s first arrival in the United Kingdom  Ireland  Sweden  Norway  Finland  Poland  Austria  Germany  and some other countries in Europe  the name was changed to  Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles   or TMHT  for short   since local censorship policies deemed the word ninja to have excessively violent connotations for a children s program  in Ireland  however  the first season aired as  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  before changing to  Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles    37  Consequently  everything related to the Turtles had to be renamed before being released in these nations  comic books  video games  toys  etc   The lyrics were also changed  such as changing  Splinter taught them to be ninja teens  to  Splinter taught them to be fighting teens   The policies also had other effects  such as removing use of Michelangelo s nunchaku  which were at the time banned from appearing in 18 rated movies  and generally toning down the usage of all the turtles  weapons  38  After many seasons of never using his nunchaku  they eventually disappeared entirely  replaced by a turtle shell shaped grappling hook called the  Turtle Line   3  In Italy  Spain and Portugal  they kept Michelangelo s Nunchakus and kept the same title but translated  Also  The Italian and Portuguese dubs had few edits  In Spain the cartoon had different dubs depending on the region  as well as Castillian Spanish  for example Galician  Catalan and Valencian language  among others  However  when the live action movie came out in 1990  the  Ninja  of the title was kept even in the UK  In time  nunchaku scenes were retained in previously censored movies such as those of Bruce Lee  The same went for the PAL releases of the early video games  which had Michelangelo s weapon of choice fully visible and usable  By the time of the 2003 TV series  these censorship policies had been abolished  and no changes have occurred in the content of the show  The name  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  remained unchanged for the 2003 TV series  As a result  in the UK  the 1987 TV series is still called Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles and the 2003 TV series is called Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  hence a disambiguation between the two TV series  On May 25  2009  Lionsgate Home Entertainment released the 25th Anniversary Collectors Edition on Region 2 DVD in the UK  This 3 Disc set contains all the episodes of Seasons 1 and 2 and 4 episodes from the final season  as well as a 1 Disc DVD with the first few episodes of Season 1  This release features the original  unedited episodes under the Ninja Turtles title  and also marks the first time the show has been released uncensored in the UK   edit  Ownership rights Due to various movie and television deals  the various TMNT films  amp  television series have split between various companies  with Mirage Studios having retained copyright and trademark until October 19  2009  at which point the rights for the entire TMNT franchise were sold by co creator Peter Laird to Nickelodeon  39   edit  TV series The original animated
