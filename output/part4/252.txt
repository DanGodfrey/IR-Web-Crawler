historical writings about West Hollywood began in the late 18th century with European colonization when the Portuguese explorer Juan Cabrillo arrived offshore and claimed the already inhabited region for Spain  Around 5 000 of the indigenous inhabitants from the Tongva Indian tribe canoed out to greet Juan Cabrillo  The Tongva tribe was a nation of hunter gatherers known for their reverence of dancing and courage  By 1771  these native people had been severely ravaged by diseases brought in by the Europeans from across wide oceans  The Spanish mission system changed the tribal name to  Gabrielinos   in reference to the Mission de San Gabriel  By 1780  what became the  Sunset Strip  was the major connecting road for El Pueblo de Los Angeles  and all ranches westward to the Pacific Ocean  This land passed through the hands of various owners during the next one hundred years  and it was called names such as  La Brea  and  Plummer  that are listed in historical records  Most of this area was part of the Rancho La Brea  and eventually it came to be owned by the Henry Hancock family  During the final decade years of the nineteenth century  the first large land development in what would later become West Hollywood the town of  Sherman  was established by Moses Sherman and his partners of the Los Angeles and Pacific Railway  an interurban railroad line which later became part of the Pacific Electric Railway system  Sherman became the location of the railroad s main shops  railroad yards  and  car barns   Many working class employees of the railroad settled in this town  It was during this time that the city began to earn its reputation as a loosely regulated  liquor friendly  during Prohibition  place for eccentric people wary of government interference  Despite several annexation attempts  the town elected not to become part of the City of Los Angeles  26   In a controversial decision  in 1925 Sherman adopted  West Hollywood       a moniker pioneered

in 1968  and efforts continued to have the sign removed  The Gay Liberation Front organized a zap of the restaurant on February 7  1970 to push for its removal  The sign came down that day  32  The sign was put up and taken down several times over the next 14 years  but the practice ended in December 1984  days after the city voted itself into existence  The then mayor  Valerie Terrigno  the
