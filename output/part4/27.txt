inhabited by a Native American tribe known as the Potawatomi  who had taken the place of the Miami and Sauk and Fox peoples  The 1780s saw the arrival of the first known non indigenous permanent settler in Chicago  Jean Baptiste Point du Sable  who is believed to be of Haitian and French descent  12  In 1795  following the Northwest Indian War  an area that was to be part of Chicago was turned over by some Native Americans in the Treaty of Greenville to the United States for a military post  In 1803  the United States Army built Fort Dearborn  which was destroyed in the War of 1812  Battle of Fort Dearborn  The Ottawa  Ojibwe  and Potawatomi had ceded additional land to the United States in the 1804 Treaty of St  Louis  The Potawatomi were eventually forcibly removed from their land following the Treaty of Chicago in 1833  On August 12  1833  the Town of Chicago was organized with a population of around 200 at that time  13  Within seven years it would grow to a population of over 4 000  On the 15th day of June  1835  the first public land sales commenced with Edmund Dick Taylor as U S  receiver of public moneys  The City of Chicago was incorporated on Saturday  March 4  1837  The name  Chicago  is derived from a French rendering of the Native American word shikaakwa  translated as  wild onion  or  wild garlic   from the Miami Illinois language  14  15  16  17  The first known reference to the site of the current city of Chicago as  Checagou  was by Robert de LaSalle around 1679 in a memoir written about the time  18  The wild garlic plants  Allium tricoccum  were described by LaSalle s comrade  naturalist diarist Henri Joutel  in his journal of LaSalle s last expedition  19  20  State and Madison Streets  the busiest corner in Chicago  1897  As the site of the Chicago Portage  the city emerged as an important transportation hub between the eastern and western United States  Chicago s first railway  Galena and Chicago Union Railroad  opened in 1848  which also marked the opening of the Illinois and Michigan Canal  The canal allowed steamboats and sailing ships on the Great Lakes to connect to the Mississippi River  A flourishing economy brought residents from rural communities and immigrants abroad  Manufacturing and retail sectors became dominant among Midwestern cities  influencing the American economy  particularly in meatpacking  with the advent of the refrigerated rail car and the regional centrality of the city s Union Stock Yards  21  In the 1850s Chicago gained national political prominence as the home of Senator Stephen Douglas  the champion of the Kansas Nebraska Act and  popular sovereignty  approach to the issue of the spread of slavery  22  These issues also helped propel another Illinoisan  Abraham Lincoln  to the national stage  Lincoln was nominated in Chicago for the nation s presidency at the 1860 Republican National Convention and went on to defeat Douglas in the general election  setting the stage for the American Civil War  Chicago experienced the fastest population growth in the world at one point  thus the city initiated infrastructure improvements  In February 1856  the Chesbrough plan for the building of Chicago s and the United States  first comprehensive sewerage system was approved by the Common Council  23  The project raised much of central Chicago to a new grade  While raising Chicago  and at first improving the health of the city  the untreated sewage and industrial waste now flowed into the Chicago River  then into Lake Michigan  polluting the primary source of fresh water for the city  Chicago responded by tunneling two miles  3 km  out into Lake Michigan to newly built water cribs  In 1900  the problem of sewage was largely resolved when the city undertook a major engineering feat  The city reversed the flow of the Chicago River so that the water flowed from Lake Michigan into the river  instead of flowing from the river into the lake  It began with the construction and improvement of the Illinois and Michigan Canal  and completed with the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal leading to the Illinois River which joins the Mississippi River  Artist s rendering of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 destroyed a third of the city  including the entire central business district  Chicago experienced rapid rebuilding and growth  24  During its rebuilding period  Chicago constructed the world s first skyscraper in 1885  using steel skeleton construction  25 Labor conflicts and unrest followed  including the Haymarket affair on May 4  1886  Concern for social problems among Chicago s lower classes led Jane Addams to be a co founder of Hull House in 1889  Programs developed there became a model for the new field of social work  During the 1870s and 1880s  Chicago and the state of Illinois together attained national stature as leaders in the movement to improve public health  City and state laws that upgraded standards for the medical profession and fought urban epidemics of cholera  small pox and yellow fever were not only passed  but also enforced  These in turn became templates for public health reform in many other states  26  The city invested in many large  well landscaped municipal parks  which also included public sanitation facilities  The chief advocate and driving force for improving public health in Chicago was Dr  John H  Rauch  M D   who established a plan for Chicago s park system in 1866  created Lincoln Park by closing a cemetery filled with festering  shallow graves  and helped establish a new Chicago Board of Health in 1867 in response to an outbreak of cholera  Ten years later he became the secretary and then the president of the first Illinois State Board of Health  which carried out most of its activities in Chicago  27  In the 19th century  Chicago became the nation s railroad center and in 1883 the standardized system of North American Time Zones was adopted by the general time convention of railway managers in Chicago  28  This gave the continent its uniform system for telling time  In 1893  Chicago hosted the World s Columbian Exposition on former marshland at the present location of Jackson Park  The Exposition drew 27 5 million visitors  and is considered the most influential world s fair in history  29  The University of Chicago was founded in 1892 on the same South Side location  The term  midway  for a fair or carnival referred originally to the Midway Plaisance  a strip of park land that still runs through the University of Chicago campus and connects Washington and Jackson Parks  Unemployed men outside a soup kitchen opened in Chicago by Al Capone  1931  Chicago s flourishing economy attracted huge numbers of new immigrants from Europe and migrants from the eastern states  Of the total population in 1900 not less than 77 4  were foreign born  or born in the United States of foreign parentage  Germans  Irish  Poles  Swedes and Czechs made up nearly two thirds of the foreign born population  30  In 1900  whites were 98 1  of the city s population  31   edit  20th and 21st centuries The 1920s saw gangsters  including Al Capone  battle law enforcement and each other on the streets of Chicago during the Prohibition era  32  The Chicago River is the south border  right  of the Near North Side and Streeterville and the north border  left  of Chicago Loop  Lakeshore East and Illinois Center  from Lake Shore Drive s Link Bridge with Trump International Hotel and Tower at jog in the river in the center  The 1920s also saw a major expansion in industry  The availability of jobs attracted blacks from the South  Between 1910 and 1930  the black population of Chicago dramatically increased from 44 103 to 233 903  33  Arriving in the hundreds of thousands during the Great Migration  the newcomers had an immense cultural impact  It was during this wave that Chicago became a center for jazz  with King Oliver leading the way  34  In 1933  Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak was fatally wounded in Miami during a failed assassination attempt on President elect Franklin D  Roosevelt  In 1933 and 1934  the city celebrated its centennial by hosting the Century of Progress International Exposition Worlds Fair  35  The theme of the fair was technological innovation over the century since Chicago s founding  36  On December 2  1942  physicist Enrico Fermi conducted the world s first controlled nuclear reaction at the University of Chicago as part of the top secret Manhattan Project  Downtown Chicago as seen from the Willis Tower Skydeck Mayor Richard J  Daley was elected in 1955  in the era of machine politics  Starting in the early 1960s due to blockbusting  many white residents  as in most American cities  left the city for the suburbs  Whole neighborhoods were completely changed based on race  Structural changes in industry caused heavy losses of jobs for lower skilled workers  In 1966  James Bevel  Martin Luther King  Jr   and Albert Raby led the Chicago Open Housing Movement  which culminated in agreements between Mayor Richard J  Daley and the movement leaders  Two years later  the city hosted the tumultuous 1968 Democratic National Convention  which featured physical confrontations both inside and outside the convention hall  including full scale riots  or in some cases police riots  in city streets  Major construction projects  including the Sears Tower  now known as the Willis Tower  which in 1974 became the world s tallest building   University of Illinois at Chicago  McCormick Place  and O Hare International Airport  were undertaken during Richard J  Daley s tenure  When Richard J  Daley died  Michael Anthony Bilandic served as mayor for three years  Bilandic s subsequent loss in a primary election has been attributed to the city s inability to properly plow city streets during a heavy snowstorm  In 1979  Jane Byrne  the city s first female mayor  was elected  She popularized the city as a movie location and tourist destination  In 1983  Harold Washington became the first African American to be elected to the office of mayor  in one of the closest mayoral elections in Chicago  After Washington won the Democratic primary  racial motivations caused a few Democratic alderman and ward committeemen to back the Republican candidate Bernard Epton  who ran on the race baiting slogan Before it s too late  37  Washington s term in office saw new attention given to poor and minority neighborhoods  Washington died in office of a heart attack in 1987  shortly after being elected to a second term  The balance of Washington s second term was served by 6th ward Alderman Eugene Sawyer  Richard M  Daley  son of Richard J  Daley  was elected in 1989  His accomplishments included improvements to parks and creating incentives for sustainable development  After successfully standing for reelection five times and becoming Chicago s longest serving Mayor  Richard M  Daley announced he would step down at the end of his final term in 2011  On February 23  2011  former White House chief of staff and congressman Rahm Emanuel won the municipal election to succeed Daley  beating five rivals with 55 percent of the vote  The other five candidates split the remaining 45 percent of votes  38  Emanuel was sworn in as Mayor on May 16  2011   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of Chicago  edit  Topography Aerial view of the Loop and the North Side with beaches lining the waterfront  Chicago is located in northeastern Illinois at the southwestern tip of Lake Michigan  It is the principal city in Chicago Metropolitan Area situated in the Midwestern United States and the Great Lakes region  Chicago rests on a continental divide at the site of the Chicago Portage  connecting the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes watersheds  The city lies beside freshwater Lake Michigan  and two rivers  the Chicago River in downtown and the Calumet River in the industrial far South Side   flow entirely or partially through Chicago  The Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal connects the Chicago River with the Des Plaines River  which runs to the west of the city  Chicago s history and economy are closely tied to its proximity to Lake Michigan  While the Chicago River historically handled much of the region s waterborne cargo  today s huge lake freighters use the city s Lake Calumet Harbor on the South Side  The lake also provides another positive effect  moderating Chicago s climate  making waterfront neighborhoods slightly warmer in winter and cooler in summer  When Chicago was founded in 1833  most of the early building began around the mouth of the Chicago River  as can be seen on a map of the city s original 58 blocks  39  The overall grade of the city s central  built up areas  is relatively consistent with the natural flatness of its overall natural geography  generally exhibiting only slight differentiation otherwise  The average land elevation is 579 ft  176 m  above sea level  The lowest points are along the lake shore at 577 ft  176 m   while the highest point  at 735 ft  224 m   is a landfill located in the Hegewisch community area on the city s far south side  Chicago Half Marathon on Lake Shore Drive next to Burnham Park in the South Side The Chicago Loop is the central business district  but Chicago is also a city of neighborhoods  Lake Shore Drive runs adjacent to a large portion of Chicago s lakefront  Some of the parks along the waterfront include Lincoln Park  Grant Park  Burnham Park and Jackson Park  29 public beaches are also found along the shore  Landfill extends into portions of the lake providing space for Navy Pier  Northerly Island  the Museum Campus  and large portions of the McCormick Place Convention Center  Most of the city s high rise commercial and residential buildings can be found close to the waterfront  An informal name for the Chicago metropolitan area is Chicagoland  used primarily by copywriters  advertising agencies  and traffic reporters  There is no precise definition for the term  Chicagoland   but it generally means the city and its suburbs together  The Chicago Tribune  which coined the term  includes the city of Chicago  the rest of Cook County  eight nearby Illinois counties  Lake  McHenry  DuPage  Kane  Kendall  Grundy  Will and Kankakee  and three counties in Indiana  Lake  Porter and LaPorte  40  The Illinois Department of Tourism defines Chicagoland as Cook County without the city of Chicago  and only Lake  DuPage  Kane and Will counties  41  The Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce defines it as all of Cook and DuPage  Kane  Lake  McHenry and Will counties  42  Chicago Harbor Lighthouse  edit  Climate Main article  Climate of Chicago The city
