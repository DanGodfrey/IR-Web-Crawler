External links  edit  Plot In 1947  cartoon characters  commonly called  toons   are living beings who act out cartoons in the same way that human actors make live action production  Toons interact freely with humans and live in Toontown  an area near Hollywood  California  R  K  Maroon is the human owner of Maroon Cartoon studios  Roger Rabbit is a fun loving toon rabbit  one of Maroon s stars  Roger s wife Jessica is a gorgeous toon woman  and Baby Herman is Roger s costar  a 50 year old toon who looks like an infant  Marvin Acme is the practical joke loving owner of Toontown and the Acme Corporation  Maroon hires private detective Eddie Valiant to investigate rumors that Jessica is having an affair  Eddie and his brother Teddy used to be friends of the toon community  but Eddie has hated them  and has been drinking heavily  since his brother Teddy was killed by a toon a few years earlier  When he shows Roger photographs of Jessica  cheating  on him by playing patty cake with Acme  Roger becomes distraught and runs away  This makes him the main suspect when Acme is found murdered the next day  At the crime scene  Eddie meets Judge Doom and his Toon Patrol of weasel henchmen  Although toons are impervious to physical abuse  Doom has discovered that they can be killed by submerging them in a mixture of solvents he refers to as  Dip   He demonstrates this to Valiant by lowering a living cartoon shoe into a drum of Dip until it dissolves  leaving only a smear of paint floating on top  Baby Herman insists that Acme s will  which is missing  bequeaths Toontown to the toons  If the will is not found by midnight  Toontown will be sold to Cloverleaf Industries  which recently bought the Pacific Electric system of trolley cars  One of Eddie s photos shows the will in Acme s pocket  proving Baby Herman s claim  After Roger shows up at his office professing his innocence  Eddie investigates the case with help from his girlfriend Dolores while hiding Roger from the Toon Patrol  Jessica tells Eddie that Maroon blackmailed her into compromising Acme  and Eddie learns that Maroon is selling his studio to Cloverleaf  Maroon explains to Eddie that Cloverleaf will not buy his studio unless they can also buy Acme s gag making factory  His plan was to use the photos to blackmail Acme into selling  Before he can say more  he is killed by an unseen assassin and Eddie sees Jessica fleeing the scene  Thinking that she is the killer  Eddie pursues her into Toontown  When he finds her  she explains that Doom killed Maroon and Acme in an attempt to take over Toontown  Eddie  Jessica  and Roger are captured by Doom and his weasels and held at the Acme Factory  where Doom reveals his plan  Since he owns Cloverleaf and Acme s will has yet to turn up  he will take control of Toontown and destroy it with a mobile Dip sprayer to make room for a freeway  then force people to use it by dismantling the trolley fleet and make a fortune through a series of businesses built to appeal to the motorists  With Roger and Jessica tied up  Eddie performs a vaudeville act that makes the weasels literally die of laughter and confronts Doom  Doom survives being run over by a steamroller  revealing that he himself is a toon and admitting that he killed Teddy  Eddie eventually dissolves Doom in Dip by opening the drain on the Dip machine  As toons and the police arrive  Eddie discovers that an apparently blank piece of paper on which Roger wrote a love poem to Jessica is actually Acme s will  written in disappearing reappearing ink  Eddie kisses Roger proving that he has regained his sense of humor and the toons celebrate their victory   edit  Cast Main article  List of Who Framed Roger Rabbit characters Bob Hoskins as Eddie Valiant  an alcoholic private investigator who holds a grudge against Toons  Producer Steven Spielberg s first choice for Eddie Valiant was Harrison Ford  but Ford s price was too high  Bill Murray

Cartoons  Roger is framed for the murder of Marvin Acme  and requests Eddie s help in proving his innocence  To facilitate Hoskins  performance  Fleischer dressed in a Roger bunny suit and  stood in

overalls  Porky Pig s bow tie  Mickey Mouse s gloves and Bugs Bunny like cheeks and ears   1  Fleischer also provides the voices of Benny the Cab and two members of Doom s Weasel Gang  Psycho and Greasy  Lou Hirsch  who supplied the voice for Baby Herman  was the original choice for Benny the Cab  but was replaced by Fleischer  4  Christopher Lloyd as Judge Doom  the extremely cold hearted and power hungry judge of Toontown District Superior Court  Lloyd was cast because he previously worked with Zemeckis and Amblin Entertainment in Back to the Future  Lloyd avoided blinking his eyes while on camera in order to perfectly portray the character  5  Kathleen Turner provides the uncredited voice of Jessica Rabbit  Roger Rabbit s stunningly beautiful and flirtatious Toon wife  She loves

Foray also voiced Lena Hyena  a hag Toon woman who resembles Jessica Rabbit and provides a comical role which shows her falling for Eddie and pursuing him  Mel Blanc voiced Bugs Bunny  Daffy Duck

 Wolf s novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit  shortly after its publication in 1981  Ron W  Miller  then president of The Walt Disney Company saw it as a perfect opportunity to produce a blockbuster  6  Jeffrey Price and Peter S  Seaman were hired to write the script  penning two drafts  Robert Zemeckis offered his services as director in 1982  1  but Disney acknowledged that his previous films  I Wanna Hold Your Hand and Used Cars  were box office bombs  and thus let him go  5  The project was revamped in 1985 by Michael Eisner  the then new CEO of Disney  Amblin Entertainment  which consisted of Steven Spielberg  Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy  were approached to produce Who Framed Roger Rabbit alongside Disney  The original budget was projected at  50 million  which Disney felt was too expensive  3  Roger Rabbit was finally greenlit when the budget went down to  29 9 million  which at the time  still made it the most expensive animated film ever greenlit  3  Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg argued that the hybrid of live action and animation would  save  Disney s animation department  Spielberg s contract included an extensive amount of creative control and a large percentage of the box office profits  Disney kept all merchandising rights  3  Spielberg convinced Warner Bros   Fleischer Studios  King Features Syndicate  Felix the Cat Productions  Turner Entertainment  and Universal Pictures Walter Lantz Productions to  lend  their characters to appear in the film with  in some cases  stipulations on how those characters were portrayed  for example  Disney s Donald Duck and Warner s Daffy Duck appear as equally talented dueling pianists  and Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny also share a scene   Apart from this agreement  Warner Bros  and the various other companies were not involved in the production of Roger Rabbit   However  Spielberg was not able to acquire the rights to use Popeye  Tom and Jerry  Little Lulu  Casper the Friendly Ghost or the Terrytoons  except Mighty Mouse  for appearances from their respective owners  King Features  Turner  Western Publishing  Harvey Comics and Viacom   1  5 Terry Gilliam was offered the chance to direct  but he found the project too technically challenging    Pure laziness on my part   he later admitted   I completely regret that decision    7  Robert Zemeckis was hired to direct in 1985  based on the success of Romancing the Stone and Back to the Future  Richard Williams was hired to direct the animation sequences  3   edit  Writing Jeffrey Price and Peter S  Seaman were brought aboard to continue writing the script once Spielberg and Zemeckis were hired  For inspiration  the two writers studied the work of Walt Disney and Warner Bros  Cartoons from the Golden Age of American animation  especially Tex Avery and Bob Clampett cartoons  Chinatown influenced the storyline  The subplot involving  Cloverleaf  was the planned story for the third chapter of a Chinatown trilogy  the trilogy was abandoned following the failure of 1990 s The Two Jakes   1  Price and Seaman said that  the Red Car plot  suburb expansion  urban and political corruption really did happen   Price stated   In Los Angeles  during the 1940s  car and tire companies teamed up against the Pacific Electric Railway system and bought them out of business  Where the freeway runs in Los Angeles is where the Red Car used to be   5  In Wolf s novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit   the Toons were comic strip characters rather than movie stars  1  During the writing process  Price and Seaman were unsure of whom to include as antagonist  They wrote scripts that had either Jessica Rabbit or Baby Herman as the villain  but they made their final decision with newly created character Judge Doom  Doom was supposed to have an animated vulture sit on his shoulder  but this was deleted for technical challenges  5  Doom also had a suitcase of 12 small animated kangaroos that act as a jury  by having their joeys pop out of their pouches  each with letters  which put together would spell YOU ARE GUILTY  This was also cut for budget and technical reasons  8  Doom s five man  Weasel Gang   Stupid  Smart Ass  Greasy  Wheezy and Psycho  satirizes the Seven Dwarfs  Doc  Grumpy  Happy  Sleepy  Bashful  Sneezy and Dopey  who appeared in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs  1937   Due to this there were originally seven weasels  but eventually two were deleted  Slimey and Flasher   5  Further references included The  Ink and Paint Club  resembling the Harlem Cotton Club  while Zemeckis compared Judge Doom s invention of  The Dip  to eliminate all the Toons as Hitler s Final Solution  1  Judge Doom was originally the hunter that killed Bambi s Mother  but Disney objected to the idea  8  Benny the Cab was first conceived to be a Volkswagen Beetle before being changed to a Taxicab  There was a whole sequence where Marvin Acme had a funeral  which Eddie witnessed  in which Foghorn Leghorn  Mickey Mouse  Minnie Mouse  Tom and Jerry  Heckle and Jeckle  Chip n  Dale  Mighty Mouse  Superman  Popeye  Olive Oyl  Bluto  Clarabelle Cow and The Seven Dwarfs would have made cameo appearances  However the scene was cut for pacing reasons and never made it past the storyboard stage  8  Before finally agreeing on Who Framed Roger Rabbit as the film s title  working titles included Murder in Toontown  Toons  Dead Toons Don t Pay Bills  The Toontown Trial  Trouble in Toontown and Eddie Goes to Toontown  9   edit  Filming Animation director Richard Williams admitted he was  openly disdainful of the Disney bureaucracy  10  and refused to work in Los Angeles  To accommodate him and his animators  production was moved to Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire  England  Disney and Spielberg also told Williams that in return for doing Roger Rabbit  they would help distribute his uncompleted film The Thief and the Cobbler  10  Supervising animators included Dale Baer  James Baxter  David Bowers  Andreas Deja  Chris Jenkins  Phil Nibbelink  Nik Ranieri and Simon Wells  The animation production  headed by associate producer Don Hahn  was split between Richard Williams  London studio and a studio in Los Angeles supervised by Dale Baer  11  The production budget continued to escalate while the shooting schedule lapsed longer than expected  When the budget was reaching  40 million  Disney president Michael Eisner heavily considered shutting down production  but Jeffrey Katzenberg talked him out of it  10  Despite the escalating budget  Disney moved forward on production because they were enthusiastic to work with Spielberg  3  Judge Doom  Christopher Lloyd  threatens Roger Rabbit before introducing him to  The Dip   Mime artists  puppeteers  mannequins and robotic arms were commonly used during filming to help the actors interact with  open air and imaginative cartoon characters   4  VistaVision cameras installed with motion control technology were used for the photography of the live action scenes which would be composited with animation  Rubber mannequins of Roger Rabbit  Baby Herman and the Weasels would portray the animated characters during rehearsals in order to teach the actors where to look when acting with  open air and imaginative cartoon characters   4  Many of the live action props held by cartoon characters were shot on set with either robotic arms holding the props or the props were manipulated by strings  similar to a marionette  5  The voice actors of the animated characters would perform off camera  giving  real time performances   The voice of Roger  Charles Fleischer insisted on wearing a Roger Rabbit costume while on the set  in order to get into character  4  Filming began on December 5  1986  and lasted for 7  months at Elstree Studios  with an additional four weeks in Los Angeles and at Industrial Light  amp  Magic  ILM  for blue screen effects of Toontown   edit  Animation Post production lasted for one year  5  First  the animators and lay out artists rotographed the live action scene  Rotographing is a process where the animators are given black and white stills of the live action scenes  known as  photo stats    then their animation papers are placed on top of them  and the artists draw in relationship to the live action images  Due to Zemeckis s dynamic camera moves  the animators had to confront the challenge of ensuring the characters were not  slipping and slipping all over the place  4  5  After rough animation was complete  it would run through the normal process of traditional animation until the cels were shot on the Rostrum camera with no background  The footage of the cartoon characters was then sent to ILM  where technicians would animate three lighting layers  Shadows  Grimm lights and Tone Mattes  separately  later optically printed onto the toons  This made them look more three dimensional and gave the illusion of the characters being affected by the lights on set  4  Finally the cartoon characters were optically composited onto the live action footage  One of the most difficult effects in the movie was Jessica s dress in the night club scene because it had flashing sequins  an effect created by filtering light through a plastic bag scratched with steel wool  1   edit  Music Who Framed Roger Rabbit  Soundtrack from the Motion Picture  Soundtrack album by Alan Silvestri

over elements with the film  but since Zemeckis had final cut privilege  he refused to make alterations  4 Jeffrey Katzenberg felt it was appropriate to release the film under their Touchstone Pictures banner instead of the traditional Walt Disney banner  14 Who Framed Roger Rabbit opened on June 22  1988  in America  grossing  11 226 239 in 1 045 theaters during its opening weekend  The film went on to gross  156 45 million in North America and  173 35 million internationally  coming to a worldwide total of  329 8 million  At the time of release  Roger Rabbit was the twentieth highest grossing film of all time  15  The film was also the second highest grossing film of 1988  behind only Rain Man  16   edit  Home video releases Who Framed Roger Rabbit was first released on VHS on October 12  1989  A laserdisc edition was also released  A DVD version was first available on September 28  1999  On March 25  2003  Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released it as a part of the  Vista Series  line in a two disc collection with many extra features including a documentary   Behind the Ears  The True Story of Roger Rabbit   a deleted scene   The Pig Head Sequence   three cartoon shorts  Tummy Trouble  Rollercoaster Rabbit  and Trail Mix Up  as well as a booklet and interactive games  The film has yet to be released to blu ray but could possibly see a blu ray release in the future   edit  Critical reception Who Framed Roger Rabbit was also a critical success and received positive reviews  Roger Ebert gave a positive review  predicting it would carry  the type of word of mouth that money can t buy  This movie is not only great entertainment but a breakthrough in craftsmanship   17 Janet Maslin of The New York Times commented that  although this isn t the first time that cartoon characters have shared the screen with live actors  it s the first time they ve done it on their own terms and make it look real   18 Desson Thomson of The Washington Post considered Roger Rabbit to be  a definitive collaboration of pure talent  Zemeckis had Walt Disney Pictures  enthusiastic backing  producer Steven Spielberg s pull  Warner Bros  s blessing  Canadian animator

emerges from it   he said  Corliss was mainly annoyed by the homages towards the Golden Age of American animation  20  Animation legend Chuck Jones made a rather scathing attack of the film in his book Chuck Jones Conversations  Among his complaints  Jones accused Robert Zemeckis of robbing Richard Williams of any creative input and ruining the piano duel that both he and Williams storyboarded  As of October 2011 update   46 reviews collected by review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes indicated 98  of reviewers enjoyed the film  earning an average score of 8 3 10  The consensus reads   Who Framed

and Disney Renaissance Who Framed Roger Rabbit marks the first  and so far  the only  time in animation history that Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse have appeared on screen together  The success of Who Framed Roger Rabbit rekindled an interest in the golden Age of American animation  and sparked the modern animation scene  29  In 1991  Walt Disney Imagineering began to develop Mickey s Toontown for Disneyland  based on the Toontown that appeared in the film  The attraction also features a ride called Roger Rabbit s Car Toon Spin  14  Three theatrical short cartoons were also produced  Tummy Trouble played in front of Honey  I Shrunk the Kids  Roller Coaster Rabbit was shown with Dick Tracy and Trail Mix Up was included with A Far Off Place  30  31  all of which were Walt Disney s first theatrical shorts since Goofy s Freeway Trouble in 1965  The film also inspired a short lived comic book and video game spin offs  including a PC game  the Japanese version of The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle  which features Roger instead of Bugs  and a 1989 game released on the Nintendo Entertainment System  31   edit  Controversy With the film s Laserdisc release  Variety first reported in March 1994 that observers uncovered several scenes of subliminal antics from the animators that supposedly featured brief nudity of the Jessica Rabbit character  While undetectable when played at the usual rate of 24 film frames per second  the Laserdisc player allowed the viewer to advance frame by frame to uncover these visuals  Whether or not they were actually intended to depict the nudity of the character remains unknown  32  33  Many retailers said that within minutes of the Laserdisc debut  their entire inventory was sold out  The run was fueled by media reports about the controversy  including stories on CNN and various newspapers  34  A Disney exec responded to Variety that  people need to get a life than to notice stuff like that  We were never aware of it  it was just a stupid gimmick the animators pulled on us and we didn t notice it  At the same time  people also need to develop a sense of humor with these things   35  Another frequently debated scene includes one where Baby Herman extends his middle finger as he passes under a woman s dress and re emerges with drool on his lip  32  33  There is also controversy over the scene where Daffy Duck and Donald Duck are playing a piano duel  and during his trademark ranting gibberish  Donald supposedly calls Daffy a  goddamn stupid nigger   however  this is a misinterpretation  the line from the script being  doggone stubborn nitwit   36  37  38   edit  Legal issue Gary K  Wolf  author of the novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit   filed a lawsuit in 2001 against The Walt Disney Company  Wolf claimed he was owed royalties based on the value of  gross receipts  and merchandising sales  In 2002  the trial court in the case ruled that these only referred to actual cash receipts Disney collected and denied Wolf s claim  In its January 2004 ruling  the California Court of Appeal disagreed  finding that expert testimony introduced by Wolf regarding the customary use of  gross receipts  in the entertainment business could support a broader reading of the term  The ruling vacated the trial court s order in favor of Disney and remanded the case for further proceedings  39  In a March 2005 hearing  Wolf estimated he was owed  7 million  Disney s attorneys not only disputed the claim but said Wolf actually owed Disney  500 000  1 million because of an accounting error discovered in preparing for the lawsuit  40   edit  Sequel With the critical and financial success of Who Framed Roger Rabbit  Walt Disney Pictures and Steven Spielberg felt it was obvious to plan a second installment  Nat Mauldin wrote a prequel titled Roger Rabbit  The Toon Platoon  set in 1941  Similar to the previous film  Toon Platoon featured many cameo appearances with characters from the golden Age of American animation  It began with Roger Rabbit s early years  living on a farm in the Midwestern United States  29  With human Richie Davenport  Roger travels west to seek his mother  in the process meeting Jessica Krupnick  his future wife   a struggling Hollywood actress  Jessica is kidnapped and forced to make pro Nazi Germany broadcasts  thus Roger and Ritchie must save her by going into Nazi occupied Europe  After their triumph  Roger and Ritchie are given a Hollywood Boulevard parade  and Roger is finally reunited with his mother  and father  Bugs Bunny  29  Mauldin later retitled the script Who Discovered Roger Rabbit  Spielberg left the project when deciding he could not satirize Nazis after directing Schindler s List  41  42  Michael Eisner commissioned a rewrite in 1997 with Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver  Although they kept Roger s search for his mother  Stoner and Oliver changed the story to Roger s inadvertent rise to stardom on Broadway and Hollywood  Disney was impressed and Alan Menken was hired to write five songs for the film and offered his services as executive producer  42  One of the songs   This Only Happens in the Movies   was recorded in 2008 on the debut album of Broadway actress Kerry Butler  43 Eric Goldberg was set to be the new animation director  and began to redesign Roger s new character appearance  42  Spielberg had no interest with the project because he was establishing DreamWorks  although Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy decided to stay on as producers  Test footage for Who Discovered Roger Rabbit was shot sometime in 1998 at the Disney animation unit in Lake Buena Vista  Florida  the results were an unwieldy mix of CGI  traditional animation and live action that did not please Disney  A second test had the Toons completely converted to CGI  but this was dropped as the film s projected budget escalated well past  100 million  Eisner felt it was best to cancel the film  42  In March 2003  producer Don Hahn said  don t expect a Roger Rabbit sequel anytime soon  Animation today is completely conquered by computers  and traditional animation just isn t the forefront anymore   44  In December 2007  Marshall admitted he was still  open  to the idea  45  and in April 2009  Zemeckis revealed he was still interested  46  It is said that the original writers  Jeffrey Price  amp  Peter S  Seaman are currently writing a new script for the project  It is also said that the cartoon characters will be in traditional 2D  while the rest will be in motion capture  47  However  in 2010  Zemeckis said that the sequel will remain 2D and live action sequences will be filmed  just like in the original film  but the lighting effects on the cartoon characters and some of the props that the toons handle will be done digitally  48  Also in 2010  Don Hahn  who was the film s original associate producer  confirmed the sequel s development in an interview with Empire magazine  He stated   Yeah  I couldn t possibly comment  I deny completely  but yeah    if you re a fan  pretty soon you re going to be very  very  very happy   49  At first  Bob Hoskins claimed he would not be reprising his role as Eddie Valiant  because he said in an interview   In order to act with cartoons  you got to be able to bounce off the walls like a cartoon  I m too old for that now   50  However  Hoskins later changed his mind and said that  I m 67 years old  I ll look like a cartoon at that point  If they do it  I m in   51   edit  The Roger Rabbit dance The Roger Rabbit became a popular dance move in the early 1990s  52  53  It was named after the floppy movements of the Roger Rabbit cartoon character  In movement  the Roger Rabbit dance is similar to the Running Man  but done by skipping backwards with arms performing a flapping gesture as if hooking one s thumbs on suspenders   edit  Themes One of the themes in the film pertains to the dismantling of public transportation systems by private companies who would profit from an automobile transportation system and freeway infrastructure  Near the end of the film  Judge Doom reveals his plot to destroy Toon Town to make way for the new freeway system  This is an indirect historical reference to the dismantling of public transportation trolley lines by National City Lines during the 1930s in what is also known as the Great American streetcar scandal  The name of Doom s company  Cloverleaf Industries  is a reference to a common freeway ramp configuration an image of which was prominently displayed in the opening credit sequence of The Wonderful World of Disney  The assertion that a conspiracy caused the demise of electric urban street railways was the subject of a session at the 1999 Annual Meeting of the Transportation Research Board entitled  Who Framed Roger Rabbit  Conspiracy Theories and Transportation   which concluded that such systems met their demise for reasons having nothing to do with a conspiracy  even as National City Lines  Inc   NCL   was a front company organized by GM s Alfred P  Sloan  Jr  in 1922  reorganized in 1936 into a holding company for the express purpose of acquiring local transit systems throughout the United States   Once  NCL  purchased a transit company  electric trolley service was immediately discontinued  the tracks quickly pulled up  the wires dismantled       and GM buses replaced the trolleys  54   edit  References
