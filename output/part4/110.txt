is a parliamentary republic in Southeastern Europe  It is bordered by Romania to the north  Serbia and the Republic of Macedonia to the west  Greece and Turkey to the south and the Black Sea to the east  Bulgaria is a very mountainous country due to its location in the Balkan peninsula  With a territory of 110 994 square kilometres  42 855 sq mi   Bulgaria ranks as Europe s 14th largest country  Prehistoric cultures began developing on Bulgarian lands during the Neolithic period  Its ancient history was marked by the presence of the Thracians  and later by the Greeks and Romans  The emergence of a unified Bulgarian ethnicity and state dates back to the 7th century and the First Bulgarian Empire  which functioned as a cultural hub for Slavic peoples and spread over most of the Balkans during the Middle Ages  With the downfall of the Second Bulgarian Empire in 1396  its territories came under Ottoman rule for nearly five hundred years  The Russo Turkish War of 1877 1878 resulted in the Third Bulgarian State  recognised in 1908  Shortly afterward  Bulgaria engaged in major conflicts with its neighbours and allied with Germany in both World Wars  In 1946 it became a communist republic and was a satellite member of the Warsaw Pact until 1989  when the Communist Party allowed multi party elections  After 1990 Bulgaria transitioned to democracy and switched to a market based economy  The current political structure dates to the adoption of a democratic constitution in 1991  Bulgaria is a member of the European Union  NATO  the Council of Europe  a founding state of the OSCE  and has been a member of the UN Security Council three times  It is a unitary state with a high degree of political  administrative and economic centralisation  and was rated a free country  5  The population of 7 36 million people is predominantly urban and mainly concentrated in the administrative centres of its 28 provinces  With 1 3 million people  the capital Sofia is the largest city and concentrates most commercial and cultural activities  The strongest sectors of the economy are heavy industry  power engineering and agriculture  all relying on local natural resources  As a historical crossroad for various civilisations  Bulgaria is the home of some of the world s most ancient cultural artifacts  Contents 1 History 1 1 Prehistory and antiquity 1 2 First Bulgarian empire

History of Bulgaria  edit  Prehistory and antiquity Further information  Neolithic Europe  Odrysian kingdom  Thracians  Slavic peoples  and Bulgars Prehistoric cultures in Bulgarian lands include the Neolithic Hamangia culture 6  and Vin a culture 7  and the eneolithic Varna culture  fifth millennium BC   The Varna Necropolis offers insights for understanding the social hierarchy of the earliest European societies  8  The earliest and one of the three primary ancestral groups of modern Bulgarians 9  were the Thracians  who populated various tribes until king Teres united most of them in the Odrysian kingdom around 500 BC  10  11  They were eventually subjugated by Alexander the Great in the 4th century and later by the Roman Empire in 46 AD  After the fall of the Roman Empire  the easternmost South Slavs gradually settled on the territory of modern Bulgaria during the 6th century and assimilated the Hellenised or Romanised Thracians  Eventually the  lite of the Central Asian Bulgars incorporated them into a new state which formed upon khan Asparukh s arrival in the Balkans  12   edit  First Bulgarian empire Main article  First Bulgarian Empire Khan Krum feasts with his nobles after the battle of Pliska  His servant  far right  brings the wine filled skull cup of Nicephorus I  Asparukh  son of Old Great Bulgaria s khan Kubrat  migrated with several Bulgar tribes to the lower courses of the rivers Danube  Dniester and Dniepr  After 670  he led a horde of as many as 50 000 across the Danube 13  and severed Moesia and Scythia Minor  Dobruja  from the Byzantine Empire  expanding his new kingdom further into the Balkan Peninsula  14  The local south Slavic language was gradually adopted by the advancing Bulgars  while preserving dominance over the Slavic majority  A peace treaty with Byzantium in 681 and the establishment of a permanent capital at Pliska south of the Danube marked the beginning of the First Bulgarian Empire  15  Succeeding khans strengthened the Bulgarian state throughout the 8th and 9th centuries Tervel established Bulgaria as a major military power by defeating a 26 000 strong Arab army during the Second Arab Siege of Constantinople  16 Krum doubled the country s territory  killed Byzantine emperor Nicephorus I in the Battle of Pliska  17  and introduced the first written code of law  Then in 864 Boris I abolished Tengriism in favour of Eastern Orthodox Christianity 18  and introduced the Cyrillic alphabet  Simeon the Great s 34 year rule began in 893 and saw the largest territorial expansion of Bulgaria  along with a golden age of Bulgarian culture  19  After Simeon s death  Bulgaria was weakened by wars with Croatians  Magyars  Pechenegs and Serbs and the spread of the Bogomil heresy  18  20  Two consecutive Rus  and Byzantine invasions resulted in the seizure of the capital Preslav by the Byzantine army in 971  21  Under Samuil  Bulgaria somewhat recovered from these attacks and managed to conquer Serbia and Albania  22  but this rise ended when Byzantine emperor Basil II defeated its army at Klyuch in 1014  Samuil died shortly after the battle  23  and by 1018 the Byzantines had ended the First Bulgarian Empire  24   edit  Second Bulgarian empire Main article  Second Bulgarian Empire The Second Bulgarian Empire under Tsar Ivan Asen II After conquering Bulgaria  Basil II retained the rule of the local nobility by incorporating them into Byzantine aristocracy and recognised the autocephaly of the Archbishopric of Ohrid  thus preventing discontent and revolts  25  After his death Byzantine domestic policies changed and a series of unsuccessful rebellions broke out  the largest being led by Peter Delyan  In 1185 Asen dynasty nobles Ivan Asen I and Peter IV organised a major uprising and succeeded in re establishing the Bulgarian state  laying the foundations of the Second Bulgarian Empire with Tarnovo as a capital  Kaloyan  the third of the Asen monarchs  extended his dominion to Nish and Skopje  He acknowledged the spiritual supremacy of the Pope and received a royal crown from a papal legate  12  The empire reached its zenith under Ivan Asen II  1218 1241   when commerce and culture flourished  12  The strong economic and religious influence of Tarnovo made it a  Third Rome   unlike the already declining Constantinople  26  The country s military and economic might declined after the Asen dynasty ended in 1257  facing internal conflicts  constant Byzantine and Hungarian attacks and Mongol domination  12  27  By the end of the 14th century  factional divisions between the feudal landlords and the spread of Bogomilism had caused the Second Bulgarian Empire to split into three tsardoms Vidin  Tarnovo and Karvuna and several semi independent principalities that fought each other  along with Byzantines  Hungarians  Serbs  Venetians and Genoese  By the late 14th century the Ottoman Turks had started their conquest of Bulgaria and most towns and fortresses south of the Balkan mountains were under their control  12   edit  Ottoman rule and national awakening Main article  Ottoman Bulgaria Tarnovo was captured by the Ottomans after a three month siege in 1393  The Vidin Tsardom fell after the defeat of a Christian crusade at the Battle of Nicopolis three years later  With this  the Ottomans subjugated all Bulgarian lands south of the Danube  28  North of the Danube  where a significant number of Bulgarian nobility and commoners remained  the population was under the jurisdiction of various autonomous  predominately Wallachian led Christian principalities  where the Bulgarian alphabet continued to be used 29  and many cities  such as the Wallachian capital of Targovishte  kept their Bulgarian names  The southern nobility however  was eliminated and the peasantry was enserfed to Ottoman masters  28  The population lost its national consciousness under the oppression of the invaders  30  Bulgarian culture was suppressed and the educated clergy fled to other countries  31  while Bulgarians were considered an inferior class of people and were subjected to heavy taxes  12  The Defence of Shipka Pass was crucial for the liberation of Bulgaria  In the final stage of the battle the Bulgarian forces  having finished their ammunition  threw rocks and bodies of fallen comrades to repulse the Ottoman attacks  32  Throughout the nearly five centuries of Ottoman rule  the Bulgarian people attempted to re establish their state by organising several revolts  most notably the First  1598  and Second Tarnovo Uprisings  1686  and Karposh s Rebellion  1689   28  The National awakening of Bulgaria became a key factor in the liberation struggle  resulting in the 1876 April Uprising  Up to 30 000 Bulgarians were killed as Ottoman authorities put down the rebellion  The massacres prompted the Great Powers to take action  33  They convened the Constantinople Conference in 1876  but their decisions were rejected by the Ottomans  This allowed the Russian Empire to seek a solution by force without risking military confrontation with other Great Powers  as had happened in the Crimean War  33  In 1877 Russia declared war on the Ottoman empire and defeated its forces with the help of Bulgarian volunteers  The Treaty of San Stefano was signed on 3 March 1878  setting up an autonomous Bulgarian principality on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire  34  35  The other Great Powers immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests  The subsequent Treaty of Berlin provided for a much smaller autonomous state comprising Moesia and the region of Sofia  leaving large populations of Bulgarians outside the new country  34  36  This prefigured Bulgaria s militaristic approach to foreign affairs and its participation in four wars during the first half of the 20th century  37  The Bulgarian principality won a war against Serbia and incorporated the semi autonomous Ottoman territory of Eastern Rumelia in 1885  proclaiming itself an independent state on 22 September 1908  38   edit  Third Bulgarian

World War I In the years following independence  Bulgaria increasingly militarised and was often referred to as  the Balkan Prussia   39  40  Between 1912 and 1918  Bulgaria became involved in three consecutive conflicts two Balkan Wars and World War I  After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War  Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I  Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1 200 000 strong army 41  42  and achieving several decisive victories at Doiran and Monastir  the country capitulated in 1918  The war resulted in significant territorial losses  a total of 412 000 casualties  and a wave of more than 253 000 43  refugees who put additional strain on the already ruined national economy  The political unrest resulting from these losses led to the establishment of a royal authoritarian dictatorship by tsar Boris III  1918 1943   Bulgaria entered World War II in 1941 as a member of the Axis but declined to participate in Operation Barbarossa and saved its Jewish population from deportation to concentration camps  44  The sudden death of Boris III in the summer of 1943 pushed the country into political turmoil as the war turned against Germany and the Communist guerilla movement gained momentum  45  Following strikes and unrest  in September 1944 the Communist dominated Fatherland Front took power  ending the alliance with Germany and joining the Allied side until the war ended  46  Zhelyu Zhelev  the first democratically elected president of Bulgaria 47

of the Soviet sphere of influence under the leadership of Georgi Dimitrov  1946 1949   Bulgaria installed a Soviet style planned economy with some market oriented policies emerging on an experimental level under Todor Zhivkov  1954 1989   49  By the mid 1950s standards of living rose significantly  50  Zhivkov s daughter Lyudmila promoted Bulgaria s national heritage  culture and arts worldwide  51  A late 1980s assimilation campaign directed against them resulted in the emigration of some 300 000 ethnic Turks to Turkey  52  53  On 10 November 1989 the Bulgarian Communist Party gave up its political monopoly  Zhivkov resigned  and Bulgaria embarked on a transition to a parliamentary democracy  54  The first free elections took place in June 1990 and were won by the Bulgarian Socialist Party  BSP  the freshly renamed Communist Party   55  A new constitution that provided for a relatively weak elected President and for a Prime Minister accountable to the legislature was adopted in July 1991  The new system initially failed to improve living standards or create economic growth the average quality of life and economic performance remained lower than under Communism well into the early 2000s  56  A 1997 reform package restored economic growth  but living standards continued to suffer  57  After 2001 economic  political and geopolitical conditions improved greatly  58  and Bulgaria achieved high Human Development status  59  It became a member of NATO in 2004 and of the European Union in 2007   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of Bulgaria Bulgaria s geographic coordinates are 43  N 25  E  60  Its total area is 110 994 kilometres  68 968 mi   which ranks it as the world s 105th largest country  61  62  A total of 1 808 kilometres  1 123 mi  of land borders

features  the Danubian Plain  the Balkan Mountains  the Thracian Plain  and the Rhodope Mountains  63  The southern edge of the Danubian Plain slopes upward into the foothills of the Balkans  while the Danube defines the border with Romania  The Thracian Plain is roughly triangular  beginning southeast of Sofia and broadening as it reaches the Black Sea coast  63  The Balkan mountains run east west through the middle of the country  north of the Rose Valley  The mountainous southwest of the country has two alpine ranges Rila and Pirin  which border the lower but more extensive Rhodope Mountains to the east  63  The highest point is Musala at 2 925 metres  9 596 ft  64  and its lowest point is sea level  Plains occupy about one third of the territory  while plateaus and hills occupy 41 per cent  65  The climate is temperate  with cold winters and hot summers  Considering its relatively small size  Bulgaria has an unusually dynamic climate due to its location at the meeting point of Mediterranean and continental air masses and the barrier effect of its mountains  63 Precipitation averages about 630 millimetres  24 8 in  per year  Rainfall varies from 500 millimetres  19 7 in  in the Dobrudja to more than 2 500 millimetres  98 4 in  in the mountains  66  Imperial eagles have a gradually growing population in Bulgaria  67  The country has a dense network of about 540 rivers

Other major rivers include the Struma and the Maritsa in the south  63   edit  Environment and wildlife Bulgaria adopted the Kyoto protocol 69  and completed the protocol s objectives by reducing carbon dioxide emissions from 1990 to 2009 by 30 per cent  70  However  pollution from factories and metallurgy works and severe deforestation continue to be major problems  71  Urban areas are particularly affected mostly due to energy production from coal based powerplants and automobile traffic  72  73  while pesticide usage in the agriculture and antiquated industrial sewage systems produced extensive soil and water pollution with chemicals and detergents  74  Bulgaria was the only EU member which does not recycle municipal waste  75  although an electronic waste recycling plant opened in June 2010  76  The situation improved in recent years  and several government funded programmes attempt to reduce pollution levels  74  Bulgaria s biodiversity is protected in three national parks  11 nature parks 77  and 17 biosphere reserves  78  Nearly 35 per cent of its land area consists of forests  79  where some of the oldest trees in the world  such as Baikushev s Pine and the Granit oak  80  grow  Its flora encompass more than 3 800 species of which 170 are endemic and 150 are considered endangered  81  The fauna is represented prominently by the brown bear and the jackal  82  while the Eurasian lynx and the Eastern imperial eagle have small  but growing populations  83   edit  Politics Main article  Politics of Bulgaria The National Assembly building Bulgaria is a

management units has varied from seven to 26  95  Between 1987 and 1999 the administrative structure consisted of nine provinces  oblasti  singular oblast   A new administrative structure was adopted in parallel with the decentralisation of the economic system  96  It includes 27 provinces and a metropolitan capital province  Sofia Grad   All areas take their names from their respective capital cities  The provinces subdivide into 264 municipalities  Municipalities are run by mayors  who are elected to four year terms  and by directly elected municipal councils  Bulgaria is a highly centralised state  as the national Council of Ministers directly appoints regional governors and all provinces and municipalities are heavily dependent on it for funding  84  Blagoevgrad Burgas

2004  signed the European Union Treaty of Accession on 25 April 2005  98  99  and became a full member of the European Union on 1 January 2007  100  Euro Atlantic integration became a priority for the country with the fall of Communism  although the Communist leadership also had aspirations of leaving the Warsaw Pact and joining the European Communities by 1987  101  102  103  Bulgaria s relationship with its neighbours since 1990 was generally good  The country also played an important role in promoting regional security  104  Bulgarian Air Force Mikoyan MiG 29 fighter jets in combat formation Bulgaria remained free of foreign deployments on its territory until 2001  when it hosted six KC 135 Stratotanker aircraft and 200 support personnel for the war effort in Afghanistan  which was the first stationing of foreign forces on its territory since World War II  105  In April 2006 Bulgaria and the United States signed a defence cooperation agreement providing for the usage of Bezmer and Graf Ignatievo air bases  the Novo Selo training range  and a logistics centre in Aytos as joint military facilities  The facilities served to enhance regional security and Bulgaria s military capabilities by means of cooperative training  106  In 2006 Foreign Policy magazine listed Bezmer Air Base as one of the six most important overseas facilities used by the USAF  107  The military of Bulgaria  an all volunteer body  comprised three services land forces  navy and air force  The country maintains a total of 913 troops deployed abroad as part of various UN and NATO missions  Historically  Bulgaria deployed significant numbers of military and civilian advisors in Soviet allied countries  such as Nicaragua 108  and Libya  more than 9 000 personnel   109  Following a series of reductions beginning in 1990  the number of active troops contracted from 152 000 in 1988 110  to about 32 000 in the 2000s  111  supplemented by a reserve force of 302 500 soldiers and officers and 34 000 paramilitary servicemen  112  The inventory was mostly of Soviet origin  such as MiG 29 fighters  SA 10 Grumble SAMs and SS 21 Scarab short range ballistic missiles  Military spending in 2009 cost  819 million  113   edit  Economy Main article  Economy of Bulgaria Sofia  the financial heart of the country Bulgaria has an industrialised market economy 114  in the upper middle income range  115  with a large private sector accounting for more than 80 per cent of GDP  116  From a largely agricultural country with a predominantly rural population in 1948  by the 1980s Bulgaria had transformed into an industrial economy with scientific and technological research as its top priorities  117  The loss of COMECON markets in 1990 and the subsequent  shock therapy  of the planned system caused a sharp drop in industrial and agricultural production  and ultimately an economic collapse in 1997  118  119  After 2001  Bulgaria experienced rapid economic growth  118  even though its income level remained one of the lowest within the EU with an average monthly wage of 752 leva  384 euro  in 2011  120  Bulgarian PPS GDP per capita stood at 44 per cent of the EU average in 2010 according to Eurostat data  121  while the cost of living was 51 per cent of the EU average  122  The currency is the lev  which is pegged to the euro at a rate of 1 95583 lev  for one euro  123  Amid the late 2000s financial crisis  the unemployment rate increased to 10 1 per cent in 2010 and GDP growth contracted from 6 2  2008  to  5 5 per cent  2009   124  125  The crisis had a negative impact mostly on industry  causing a 10 per cent decline in the national industrial production index  a 31 per cent drop in mining  and a 60 per cent drop in  ferrous and metal production   126  Positive growth was restored in 2010  reaching 0 2 per cent  125  Corruption in the public administration and a weak judiciary hampered Bulgaria s economic development  127  128  Unequal distribution of wealth was a serious problem  In 2007 Bulgaria had the highest income inequality in Europe with a Gini coefficient of 45 3  At the same time Bulgaria ranks 28th in the Economic Freedom of the World index  129  has the lowest personal and corporate income tax rates in the European Union  130  and the second lowest public debt of all member states at 16 2 per cent of GDP in 2010  131  In 2010  GDP  PPP  was estimated at  97 1 billion  with a per capita value of  12 934  2  Sofia and the surrounding Yugozapaden planning area were the most developed region of the country with a per capita PPS GDP of  25 130  132  The service sector accounted for 64 6 per cent of GDP  followed by industry with 30 1 per cent and agriculture with 5 3 per cent  133  The labour force included 2 5 million people  134  Bulgaria  orange  and its largest export partners Even though relatively poor in natural resources  local deposits of iron  copper  lead and coal are vital for Bulgaria s manufacturing sector  135  Major industries include extraction of metals and minerals  production of chemicals  machinery and vehicle components  136 petroleum refinement 137  and steel  138  Primary industrial exports were clothing  iron and steel  machinery and refined fuels  139  The mining sector and its related industries employed a total of 120 000 people and generated about five per cent of the country s GDP with  3 51 billion worth of exports  140  The country is Europe s fourth largest gold producer and the sixth largest coal producer  140  141  In 2008 the electronics industry shipped more than  260 million in exports  primarily of components  computers and consumer electronics  142  Another major area of Bulgaria s industry was military equipment  with exports of  358 million in 2010  143  including the manufacture of 50 per cent of all radar systems for Northrop Grumman s UK branch  144  In contrast with the industrial sector  agriculture has declined since the beginning of the 2000s  Production in 2008 amounted to only 66 per cent of that between 1999 and 2001  145  while cereal and vegetable yields dropped by nearly 40 per cent after 1990  146  Bulgaria remained a net agricultural and food exporter  two thirds of its exports are to OECD countries  147  The country is the largest global producer of perfumery essential oils such as lavender and rose oil  105  148  A five year modernisation and development programme was launched by the government in 2007  aimed at strengthening the agricultural sector by investing a total of 3 2 billion euros  149  In recent years
