historian Sidney Lens notes that  the urge for expansion   at the expense of other peoples   goes back to the beginnings of the United States itself   2  Effects labelled  cultural imperialism  occur without overt government policy  citation needed Stuart Creighton Miller says that the public s sense of innocence about Realpolitik impairs popular recognition of U S  imperial conduct  The resistance to actively occupying foreign territory has led to policies of exerting influence via other means  including governing other countries via surrogates  where domestically unpopular governments survive only through U S  support  6  The maximum geographical extension of American direct political and military control happened in the aftermath of World War II  in the period after the surrender and occupations of Germany and Austria in May and later Japan and Korea in September 1945 and before the independence of the Philippines in July 1946  citation needed   edit  American exceptionalism Main article  American exceptionalism American exceptionalism refers to the theory that the United States occupies a special niche among the nations of the world 7  in terms of its national credo  historical evolution  political and religious institutions and origins  Philosopher Douglas Kellner traces the identification of American exceptionalism as a distinct phenomenon back to 19th century French observer Alexis de Tocqueville  who concluded by agreeing that the U S   uniquely  was  proceeding along a path to which no limit can be perceived   8  American exceptionalism is popular among people within the U S   9  but its validity and its consequences are disputed  As a Monthly Review editorial opines on the phenomenon   in Britain  empire was justified as a benevolent  white man s burden   And in the United States  empire does not even exist   we  are merely protecting the causes of freedom  democracy  and justice worldwide   10   edit  Imperialism at the heart of U S  foreign policy Further information  Military history of the United States  Overseas interventions of the United States 1898 political cartoon   Ten Thousand Miles From Tip to Tip  meaning the extension of U S  domination  symbolized by a bald eagle  from Puerto Rico to the Philippines  The cartoon contrasts this with a map of the smaller United States 100 years earlier in 1798  Historian Donald W  Meinig says that imperial behavior for the United States dates at least to the Louisiana Purchase  which he describes as an  imperial acquisition   imperial in the sense of the aggressive encroachment of one people upon the territory of another  resulting in the subjugation of that people to alien rule   The U S  policies towards the Native Americans he said were  designed to remold them into a people more appropriately conformed to imperial desires   11  Early twentieth writers academics like Charles A  Beard and Andrew Bacevich  in support of non interventionism  sometimes referred to in a derogatory manner as  isolationism    discussed American policy as being driven by self interested expansionism going back as far back as the writing of the Constitution  Some politicians today do not agree  Pat Buchanan claims that the modern United States  drive to empire is  far removed from what the Founding Fathers had intended the young Republic to become   12  Bacevich argues that the U S  did not fundamentally change its foreign policy after the Cold War  and remains focused on an effort to expand its control across the world  13  As the surviving superpower at the end of the Cold War  the U S  could focus its assets in new directions  the future being  up for grabs  according to former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Paul Wolfowitz in 1991  14  Sidney Lens calls American exceptionalism a myth which allows any number of  excesses and cruelties  though sometimes admitted  usually  to be  regarded as momentary aberrations   2  In Manufacturing Consent  The Political Economy of the Mass Media  the political activist Noam Chomsky argues that exceptionalism and the denials of imperialism are the result of a systematic strategy of propaganda  to  manufacture opinion  as the process has long been described in other countries  15   Domination of the media   according to Chomsky  allows an elite to  fix the premises of discourse and interpretation  and the definition of what is newsworthy in the first place   16   edit  Emerging Contrary Views Currently minor disputes exist between Mexico and the United States concerning river beds that have changed over time  No other major land dispute exists with America as an empire or imperialist power  America does not have a pre defined policy to acquire land or expand its borders  Most recent historical references are the acquisition of Alaska and Hawaii  Territorial expansion policy has historically been based loosely on armed conflicts with which America became involved  American involvement with war has led to debts that other countries owe yet direct acquisition or subordination of the existing citizenry in return payment has not occurred  America lacks a king and is precluded from making such a declaration through its form of government  During its period of colonial expansion when being founded by land owning countries of predominately European descent practices from the Europeans were applied to the land  These practices resulted in dislocation of native people who are sovereign citizens within the borders of America   edit  Views of American imperialism Caricature showing Uncle Sam lecturing four children labelled Philippines  Hawaii  Porto Rico  sic  and Cuba in front of children holding books labelled with various U S  states  The caption reads   School Begins  Uncle Sam  to his new class in Civilization   Now  children  you ve got to learn these lessons whether you want to or not  But just take a look at the class ahead of you  and remember that  in a little while  you will feel as glad to be here as they are   Journalist Ashley Smith divides theories of the U S  imperialism into 5 broad categories   1   liberal  theories   2   social democratic  theories   3   Leninist  theories   4  theories of  super imperialism   and  5   Hardt and Negri ite  theories  17  page needed  There is also a conservative  anti interventionist view as expressed by American journalist John T  Flynn  The enemy aggressor is always pursuing a course of larceny  murder  rapine and barbarism  We are always moving forward with high mission  a destiny imposed by the Deity to regenerate our victims  while incidentally capturing their markets  to civilise savage and senile and paranoid peoples  while blundering accidentally into their oil wells  18  A  social democratic  theory attribution needed  says that imperialistic U S  policies are the products of the excessive influence of certain sectors of U S  business and government the arms industry in alliance with military and political bureaucracies and sometimes other industries such as oil and finance  a combination often referred to as the  military industrial complex   The complex is said to benefit from war profiteering and the looting of natural resources  often at the expense of the public interest  19  The proposed solution is typically unceasing popular vigilance in order to apply counter pressure  20  Johnson holds a version of this view  citation needed  Alfred T  Mahan  who served as an officer in the U S  Navy during the late 19th century  supported the notion of American imperialism in his 1890 book titled The Influence of Sea Power upon History  In chapter one Mahan argued that modern industrial nations must secure foreign markets for the purpose of exchanging goods and  consequently  they must maintain a maritime force that is capable of protecting these trade routes  21  page needed  Mahan s argument provides a context that also justifies imperialism by industrial nations such as the United States  citation needed  A theory of  super imperialism  says attribution needed  that imperialistic U S  policies are driven not simply by the interests of American businesses  but by the interests of the economic elites of a global alliance of developed countries  citation needed  Capitalism in Europe  the U S   and Japan has become too entangled  in this view  to permit military or geopolitical conflict between these countries  and the central conflict in modern imperialism is between the global core and the global periphery rather than between imperialist powers  Political scientists Leo Panitch and Samuel Gindin hold versions of this view  22  23  24  25  Lenin argued this view was wishful thinking  26   edit  Empire In the book  Empire   Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri argue that  the decline of Empire has begun   27  Hardt says the Iraq War is a classically imperialist war  and is the last gasp of a doomed strategy  28  This new era still has colonizing power  but it has moved from national military forces based on an economy of physical goods to networked biopower based on an informational and affective economy  The U S  is central to the development and constitution of a new global regime of international power and sovereignty  termed Empire  but is decentralized and global  and not ruled by one sovereign state   the United States does indeed occupy a privileged position in Empire  but this privilege derives not from its similarities to the old European imperialist powers  but from its differences   29  Hardt and Negri draw on the theories of Spinoza  Foucault  Deleuze  and Italian autonomist marxists  30  31  Geographer David Harvey says there has emerged a new type of imperialism due to geographical distinctions as well as uneven levels of development  32  He says there has emerged three new global economic and politics blocs  the United States  the European Union  and East Asia centered around China and Japan  33  He says there are tensions between the three major blocs over resources and economic power  citing the 2003 invasion of Iraq  whose goal was to prevent rivals from controlling oil  34  Furthermore  Harvey argues there can arise conflict within the major blocs between capitalists and politicians due to their opposing economic interests  35  Politicians  on the other hand  live in geographically fixed locations and are  in the U S  and Europe  accountable to the electorate  The  new  imperialism  then  has led to an alignment of the interests of capitalists and politicians in order to prevent the rise and expansion of possible economic and political rivals from challenging America s dominance  36   edit  U S  military bases Further information  List of United States military bases Chalmers Johnson argues that America s version of the colony is the military base  37 Chip Pitts argues similarly that enduring U S  bases in Iraq suggest a vision of  Iraq as a colony   38  There have also been conflicting reports made by U S  government officials as to how many military bases actually exist outside the country  39  While territories such as Guam  the United States Virgin Islands  the Northern Mariana Islands  American Samoa  and Puerto Rico remain under U S  control  the U S  allowed many of its overseas territories or occupations to gain independence after World War II  Examples include the Philippines  1946   the Panama canal zone  1979   Palau  1981   the Federated States of Micronesia  1986   and the Marshall Islands  1986   Most of them still have U S  bases within their territories  In the case of Okinawa  which came under U S  administration after the battle of Okinawa during World War II  this happened despite local popular opinion  40  As of 2003  the United States had bases in over 36 countries worldwide  41   edit  Benevolent imperialism Main article  Neoconservatism Max Boot defends U S  imperialism by claiming   U S  imperialism has been the greatest force for good in the world during the past century  It has defeated communism and Nazism and has intervened against the Taliban and Serbian ethnic cleansing   Boot willingly used  imperialism  to describe United States policy  not only in the early 20th century but  since at least 1803   42  43  Columnist Charles Krauthammer says   People are now coming out of the closet on the word  empire    This embrace of empire is made by many neoconservatives  including British historian Paul Johnson  and writers Dinesh D Souza and Mark Steyn  It is also made by some liberal hawks  such as political scientist Zbigniew Brzezinski  and Michael Ignatieff  44  For instance  British historian Niall Ferguson argues that the United States is an empire  but believes that this is a good thing  Ferguson has drawn parallels between the British Empire and the imperial role of the United States in the late 20th century and early 21st century  though he describes the United States  political and social structures as more like those of the Roman Empire than of the British  Ferguson argues that all these empires have had both positive and negative aspects  but that the positive aspects of the U S  empire will  if it learns from history and its mistakes  greatly outweigh its negative aspects  45  page needed   edit  American imperialism as an aberration Another point of view believes United States expansion overseas has been imperialistic  but this imperialism as a temporary phenomenon  a corruption of American ideals or the relic of a past historical era  Historian Samuel Flagg Bemis argues that Spanish American War expansionism was a short lived imperialistic impulse and  a great aberration in American history   a very different form of territorial growth than that of earlier American history  46  Historian Walter LaFeber sees the Spanish American War expansionism not as an aberration  but as a culmination of United States expansion westward  47  But both agree that the end of the occupation of the Philippines marked the end of U S  empire  hence denying that present United States foreign policy is imperialistic  Historian Victor Davis Hanson argues that the U S  does not pursue world domination  but maintains worldwide influence by a system of mutually beneficial exchanges  48  Liberal internationalists argue that even though the present world order is dominated by the United States  the form taken by that dominance is not imperial  International relations scholar John Ikenberry argues that international institutions have taken the place of empire  49  International relations scholar Joseph Nye argues that U S  power is more and more based on  soft power   which comes from cultural hegemony rather than raw military or economic force  50  This includes such factors as the widespread desire to emigrate to the United States  the prestige and corresponding high proportion of foreign students at U S  universities  and the spread of U S  styles of popular music and cinema  Thus the U S   no matter how hegemonic  can no longer be considered to be an  empire  in the classic sense of the term   edit  Factors unique to the  Age of imperialism  A variety of factors may have coincided during the  Age of Imperialism  in the late 19th century  when the United States and the other major powers rapidly expanded their territorial possessions  Some of these are explained  or used as examples for the various perceived forms of American imperialism  The prevalence of racism  notably Ernst Haeckel s  biogenic law   John Fiske s conception of Anglo Saxon racial superiority  and Josiah Strong s call to  civilize and Christianize    all manifestations of a growing Social Darwinism and racism in some schools of American political thought  51  Early in his career  as Assistant Secretary of the Navy  Roosevelt was instrumental in preparing the Navy for the Spanish American War 52  and was an enthusiastic proponent of testing the U S  military in battle  at one point stating  I should welcome almost any war  for I think this country needs one   53  54  55   edit  Debate over U S  foreign policy Some scholars  however  defend the historical role of the U S  56  Other prominent political figures  such as former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld  for example  have argued that   The U S  does not  seek empires  We re not imperialistic  We never have been   57  Thorton wrote that       imperialism is more often the name of the emotion that reacts to a series of events than a definition of the events themselves  Where colonization finds analysts and analogies  imperialism must contend with crusaders for and against   58  Political theorist Michael Walzer argues that the term hegemony is better than empire to describe the US s role in the world  59  political scientist Robert Keohane agrees saying  a  balanced and nuanced analysis is not aided   by the use of the phrase  empire  to describe United States hegemony  since  empire  obscures rather than illuminates the differences in form of rule between the United States and other Great Powers  such as Great Britain in the nineteenth century or the Soviet Union in the twentieth   60  Other political scientists  such as Daniel Nexon and Thomas Wright  argue that neither term exclusively describes foreign relations of the United States  The U S  can be  and has been  simultaneously an empire and a hegemonic power  They claim that the general trend in U S  foreign relations has been away from imperial modes of control  61   edit  Cultural imperialism Some critics of imperialism argue that military and cultural imperialism are interdependent  American Edward Said  one of the founders of post colonial theory  said that           so influential has been the discourse insisting on American specialness  altruism and opportunity  that imperialism in the United States as a word or ideology has turned up only rarely and recently in accounts of the United States culture  politics and history  But the connection between imperial politics and culture in North America  and in particular in the United States  is astonishingly direct  62    International relations scholar David Rothkopf disagree and argues that cultural imperialism is the innocent result of globalization  which allows access to numerous U S  and Western ideas and products that many non U S  and non Western consumers across the world voluntarily choose to consume  63 Matthew Fraser has a similar analysis  but argues further that the global cultural influence of the U S  is a good thing  64   edit  See also 51st state American  word  American Anti Imperialist League American Century Americanization Anti
