Gulf of Mexico to the south  and Mississippi to the west  Alabama is the 30th most extensive and the 23rd most populous of the 50 United States  Alabama ranks second in the area of its inland waterways  From the American Civil War until World War II  Alabama  like many Southern states  suffered economic hardship  in part because of continued dependence on agriculture  Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers  white rural interests dominated the state legislature until the 1960s  while urban interests and African Americans were under represented  6  Following World War II  Alabama experienced growth as the economy of the state transitioned from agriculture to diversified interests in heavy manufacturing  mineral extraction  education  and technology  In addition  the establishment or expansion of multiple military installations  primarily those of the U S  Army and U S  Air Force  added to state jobs  Alabama is unofficially nicknamed the Yellowhammer State  after

History Main article  History of Alabama  edit  Etymology The Alabama people  a Muskogean speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa Rivers on the upper reaches of the Alabama River  7  served as the etymological source of the names of the river and state  In the Alabama language  the word for an Alabama person is Albaamo  or variously Albaama or Alb amo in different dialects  the plural form  Alabama persons  is Albaamaha   8  The word Alabama is believed to have originated from the Choctaw language 9  and was later adopted by the Alabama tribe as their name  10  The spelling of the word varies significantly between sources  10  The first usage appears in three accounts of the Hernando de Soto expedition of 1540 with Garcilasso de la Vega using Alibamo  while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote Alibamu and Limamu  respectively  10  As early as 1702  the tribe was known to the French as Alibamon with French maps identifying the river as Rivi re des Alibamons  7  Other spellings of the appellation have included Alibamu  Alabamo  Albama  Alebamon  Alibama  Alibamou  Alabamu  and Allibamou  10  11  12  13  Although the origin of Alabama could be discerned  sources disagree on its meaning  An 1842 article in the Jacksonville Republican originated the idea that the meaning was  Here We Rest   10  This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of Alexander Beaufort Meek  10  Experts in the Muskogean languages have been unable to find any evidence to support such a translation  7  10  Scholars believe the word comes from the Choctaw alba  meaning  plants  or  weeds   and amo  meaning  to cut    to trim   or  to gather    9  10  14  The meaning may have been  clearers of the thicket  9  or  herb gatherers  14  15  which may refer to clearing of land for cultivation 11  or to collecting medicinal plants  15   edit  Indigenous peoples  early history Mount Cheaha  Alabama s highest point Indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before European colonization  Trade with the Northeast via the Ohio River began during the Burial Mound Period  1000 BC AD 700  and continued until European contact  16  The agrarian Mississippian culture covered most of the state from AD 1000 to 1600  with one of its major centers being at the Moundville Archaeological Site in Moundville  Alabama  17  18  Analysis of artifacts recovered from archaeological excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars  formulating the characteristics of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex  SECC   19  Contrary to popular belief  the SECC appears to have no direct links to Mesoamerican culture  but developed independently  The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples  it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood  20  Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in the area of present day Alabama at the time of European contact were Iroquoian speaking Cherokee  and the Muskogean speaking Alabama  Alibamu   Chickasaw  Choctaw  Creek  Koasati  and Mobile  21   edit  European settlement The French founded the first European settlement in the region at Old Mobile  in 1702  22  The area was French from 1702 to 1763  part of British West Florida from 1763 to 1780  Thomas Bassett was the first British settler in the state  He settled near what is now Tombigbee River in Washington County  23  Alabama became part of Spanish West Florida from 1780 to 1810  part of the independent Republic of West Florida for a short time  90 days   annexed by the U S  and added to the Territory of Orleans  1810   and  finally  added to the Mississippi Territory in 1812  Throughout these later developments  however  the Spanish had kept a nominal  although largely ignored  governmental presence in the region  based out of Mobile  When Andrew Jackson s forces occupied Mobile in 1814  while preparing for the Battle of New Orleans  he demonstrated the United States  de facto authority over the region  effectively ending Spanish governance  though not its claim   while gaining an unencumbered passage to the gulf  24  The area making up today s northern and central Alabama  known as the Yazoo lands  had been claimed by the Province of Georgia after 1763  Following the Revolutionary War  it remained a part of the state of Georgia  although heavily disputed  Conflicting claims to the area were held  first by several Native American tribes  most notably the Chickamauga Cherokee and Yazoo   by other states  e g  South Carolina   and by the US federal government  Britain and Spain  In 1802  the region was joined to the Mississippi Territory  Individual statehood was delayed  however  by the territory s lack of a coastline   edit  Statehood  Civil War  and Reconstruction Old Alabama state capital ruins at Capital Park in Tuscaloosa Alabama admitted to the Union in 1819 as the 22nd state  Part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s  its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men  Settlers rapidly arrived to take advantage of the fertile soil  Southeastern planters and traders from the Upper South brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations expanded  The economy of the central  Black Belt   named for its dark  productive soil  was built around large cotton plantations whose owners  wealth grew largely from slave labor  25  The area also drew many poor  disfranchised people who became subsistence farmers  The 1860 census records show that enslaved Africans comprised 45  of the state s total population of 964 201  There were only 2 690 free persons of color living in Alabama at the time  From 1826 to 1846  Tuscaloosa served as the capital of Alabama  On January 30  1846  the Alabama legislature announced that it had voted to remove the capital city from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery  The first legislative session in the new capital met in December 1847  In time  a Capitol building was erected under the direction of a Philadelphia  Pennsylvania architect  The original structure burnt down in 1849 but was rebuilt in 1851 following the original plans  26  On January 11  1861  Alabama declared its secession from the Union and joined the Confederate States of America  While few battles were fought in the state  Alabama contributed about 120 000 soldiers to the American Civil War  Alabama s slaves were freed by the 13th Amendment in 1865  27  During Reconstruction  the new state legislators created a public school system for the first time  as well as establishing some welfare institutions to help its people  Alabama was officially restored to the Union in 1868  After the Civil War  the state was still chiefly agricultural  with an economy tied to cotton  Planters resisted working with free labor during Reconstruction and sought to re establish controls over freedmen  In the early years the Ku Klux Klan had numerous independent chapters in Alabama that attacked freedmen and other Republicans  After it was suppressed  insurgent whites organized paramilitary groups  such as the Red Shirts and White League  that acted more openly to suppress black voting  Regaining power by the late 1870s  in the last decade of the 19th century  white Democrats passed electoral laws disfranchise most blacks and many poor whites  28  Having regained power in the state legislature  Democrats passed Jim Crow laws  including racial segregation in public facilities  to restore white supremacy in the society  In 1875  the state passed the Blaine Amendment  to prohibit public money from being used to finance Catholic schools  29   edit  1900 1960 School in Alabama  Farm Security Administration  1935  The new 1901 Constitution of Alabama effectively disfranchised African Americans and many poor whites through voting restrictions  including literacy requirements  While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to support these legislative efforts  the new restrictions resulted in disfranchising poor whites as well  due mostly to imposition of a cumulative poll tax  In 1900  14 Black Belt counties had more than 79 000 voters on the rolls  clarification needed  By June 1  1903  the number of clarification needed  registered voters had dropped to 1 081  In 1900  Alabama had more than 181 000 African Americans eligible to vote  By 1903  only 2 980 had qualified to register  although at least 74 000 black voters were literate  30  By 1941  a total of more whites than blacks had been disfranchised  600 000 whites to 520 000 blacks  30  Nearly all African Americans lost the ability to vote  The disfranchisement was ended by African Americans  leading the Civil Rights Movement and gaining Federal legislation in the mid 1960s to protect their voting and civil rights  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 also protected the suffrage of poor whites  The rural dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disfranchised African Americans in the segregated state  but did not relieve them of paying taxes  25  Continued racial discrimination  agricultural depression  and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans to seek opportunities in northern cities  They left Alabama in the early 20th century as part of the Great Migration to industrial jobs and better futures in northern industrial cities  The population growth rate in Alabama  see  Historical Populations  table below  dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920  reflecting the effect of emigration  At the same time  many rural whites and blacks migrated to the city of Birmingham for work in new industrial jobs  It experienced such rapid growth that it was nicknamed  The Magic City   By the 1920s  Birmingham was the 19th largest city in the U S  and held more than 30  of the population of the state  Heavy industry and mining were the basis of the economy  31  This structure greets drivers visiting the Alabama Welcome Center just inside the AL GA border off of Interstate 20  Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought prosperity  25  Cotton faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base  In the 1960s under Governor George Wallace  many whites in the state opposed federal integration efforts in schools and public facilities   edit  1960 present Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961  the rural dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population  They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas  In addition  the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside Birmingham  One result was that Jefferson County  containing Birmingham s industrial and economic powerhouse  contributed more than one third of all tax revenue to the state  but did not receive a proportional amount in services  Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature  A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination   A minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature   6  African Americans were presumed partial to Republicans for historical reasons  but they were disfranchised  White Alabamans felt bitter towards the Republican Party in the aftermath of the Civil War and Reconstruction  These factors created a longstanding tradition that any candidate who wanted to be viable with white voters had to run as a Democrat regardless of political beliefs  During the Civil Rights Movement  African Americans achieved a protection of voting and other civil rights through the passage of the national Civil Rights Act of 1964  32  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965  De jure segregation ended in the states as Jim Crow laws were invalidated or repealed  33  Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965  cases were filed in Federal courts to force Alabama to properly redistrict by population both the House and Senate of the state legislature  In 1972  for the first time since 1901  the legislature implemented the Alabama constitution s provision for periodic redistricting based on population  This benefited the urban areas that had developed  as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60 years  6  After 1972  the state s white voters shifted much of their support to Republican candidates in presidential elections  as also occurred in neighboring southern states   Since 1990 the majority of whites in the state have voted increasingly Republican in state elections  In 2010  Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years  34   edit  Geography Alabama terrain map

labeled the Wetumpka crater or astrobleme   star wound   because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface  44  In 2002  Christian Koeberl

state is classified as humid subtropical  Cfa  under the Koppen Climate Classification  46  The average annual temperature is 64  F  18  C   Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico  while the northern parts of the state  especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast  tend to be slightly cooler  47  Generally  Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year  Alabama receives an average of 56 inches  1 400 mm  of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300 days in the southern part of the state  47  Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the United States  with high temperatures averaging over 90  F  32  C  throughout the summer in some parts of the state  Alabama is also prone to tropical storms and even hurricanes  Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms  which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken  Though winters in the state are usually mild  nightly freezing occurs frequently in the North Alabama region  This is shown in this picture taken at the Old State Bank in Decatur during early January  South Alabama reports many thunderstorms  The Gulf Coast  around Mobile Bay  averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported  This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state  but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60 days per year  Occasionally  thunderstorms are severe with frequent lightning and large hail   the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm  Alabama ranks seventh in the number of deaths from lightning and ninth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita  48  Alabama  along with Kansas  has the most reported EF5 tornadoes of any state   according to statistics from the National Climatic Data Center for the period January 1  1950  to October 31  2006  49  Several long   tracked F5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities than any other state  even surpassing Texas which has a much larger area within Tornado Alley  The state suffered damage in the Super Outbreak of April 1974  and the April 25 28  2011 tornado outbreak  The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state  Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December  along with the spring severe weather season  The northern part of the state   along the Tennessee Valley   is one of the areas in the U S  most vulnerable to violent tornadoes  The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as Dixie Alley  as distinct from the Tornado Alley of the Southern Plains  Winters are generally mild in Alabama  as they are throughout most of the southeastern United States  with average January low temperatures around 40  F  4  C  in Mobile and around 32  F  0  C  in Birmingham  Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama  areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter  with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years  Historic snowfall events include New Year s Eve 1963 snowstorm and the 1993 Storm of the Century  The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is 2 inches  51 mm  per year  In the southern Gulf coast  snowfall is less frequent  sometimes going several years without any snowfall  Alabama s highest recorded temperature of 114 F was recorded on September 5  1925 in the unincorporated communuty of Centerville   27 F was the state s record low recorded in 1966 in New Market  Monthly normal high and

State Capitol  built in 1850  edit  State government Main article  Government of Alabama The foundational document for Alabama s government is the Alabama Constitution  which was ratified in 1901  At almost 800 amendments and 310 000 words  it is the world s longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the U S  Constitution  99  100  There is a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama s constitution  101  This movement is based upon the fact that Alabama s constitution highly centralizes power in Montgomery and leaves practically no power in local hands  Any policy changes proposed around the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and  frequently  by state referendum  One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length were intentional to codify segregation and racism  Alabama is divided into three equal branches  The legislative branch is the Alabama Legislature  a bicameral assembly composed of the Alabama House of Representatives  with 105 members  and the Alabama Senate  with 35 members  The Legislature is responsible for writing  debating  passing  or defeating state legislation  The executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws  It is headed by the Governor of Alabama  Other members of executive branch include the cabinet  the Attorney General of Alabama  the Alabama Secretary of State  the Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries  the Alabama State Treasurer  and the State Auditor of Alabama  The current governor of the state is Republican Robert Bentley  The lieutenant governor is Republican Kay Ivey  The Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Democrat Sue Bell Cobb  The Republican Party currently holds a majority in both houses of the Legislature  The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority  most state Legislatures require a two thirds majority to override a veto   The judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases  The highest court is the Supreme Court of Alabama  The members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections  The statewide officials  such as the Governor  Lieutenant Governor  Attorney General  and other constitutional offices take office in the following January  102   edit  Taxes Alabama levies a 2  4  or 5 percent personal income tax  depending upon the amount earned and filing status  Taxpayers are not allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax  but can deduct federal Social Security and Medicare taxes  The state s general sales tax rate is 4   103  The collection rate could be substantially higher  depending upon additional city and county sales taxes  For example  the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10  and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1   which means that a diner in Mobile would pay a 11  tax on a meal  Sales and excise taxes in Alabama account for 51  of all state and local revenue  compared with an average of about 36  nationwide  Alabama is also one of the few remaining states that levies a tax on food and medicine  Alabama s income tax on poor working families is among the nation s very highest  104  Alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as  4 600  which is barely one quarter of the federal poverty line  104  Alabama s threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the District of Columbia with income taxes  104  The corporate income tax rate is currently 6 5   The overall federal  state  and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax burdened state in the country  105 Property taxes are the lowest in the United States  The current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes  Since Alabama s tax structure largely depends on consumer spending  it is subject to high variable budget structure  For example  in 2003 Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as  670 million   edit  Local and county government Alabama counties  clickable map  Alabama has 67

Alabama Constitution  all but seven counties  Jefferson  Lee  Mobile  Madison  Montgomery  Shelby  and Tuscaloosa  in the state have little to no home rule  Instead  most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies such as waste disposal to land use zoning  On November 9  2011 Jefferson County declared bankruptcy  106

occupied by federal troops of the Third Military District under General John Pope  In 1874  the political coalition known as the Redeemers took control of the state government from the Republicans  in part by suppressing the African American vote  After 1890  a coalition of whites passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise black residents  a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution  Provisions which disfranchised African Americans also disfranchised poor whites  however  By 1941 more whites than blacks had been disfranchised  600 000 to 520 000  although the impact was greater on the African American community  as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised  From 1901 through the 1960s  the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state  The result was a rural minority that dominated state politics until a series of court cases required redistricting in 1972  Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the American Civil Rights Movement  when majority whites bureaucratically  and at times  violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform  Democrat George Wallace  the state s only four term governor  was a controversial figure  Only with the passage of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 32  and Voting Rights Act of 1965 did African Americans regain suffrage and other civil rights  In 2007  the Alabama Legislature passed  and Republican Governor Bob Riley signed  a resolution expressing  profound regret  over slavery and its lingering impact  In a symbolic ceremony  the bill was signed in the Alabama State Capitol  which housed Congress of the Confederate States of America  108   edit  Elections Main article  Elections in Alabama  edit  State elections With the disfranchisement of African Americans  the state became part of the  Solid South   a system in which the Democratic Party became essentially the only political party in every Southern state  For nearly 100 years  local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary  with generally only token Republican challengers running in the General Election  Republicans hold all nine seats on the Alabama Supreme Court 109  and all ten seats on the state appellate courts  Until 1994  no Republicans held any of the court seats  This change also began  likely in part  due to the same perception by voters of Democratic party efforts to disenfranchise voters again in 1994  In that general election  the then incumbent Chief Justice of Alabama  Ernest C  Hornsby  refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3 000 votes to Republican Perry O  Hooper  Sr   Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court  This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles  The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench  Republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices  Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the Alabama State Board of Education  In 2010  Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years  Democrats hold one of the three seats on the Alabama Public Service Commission  110  111  112  Only two Republican Lieutenant Governors have been elected since Reconstruction  one is Kay Ivey  the current Lieutenant Governor   edit  Local elections Many local offices  County Commissioners  Boards of Education  Tax Assessors  Tax Collectors  etc   in the state are still held by Democrats  Local elections in most rural counties are generally decided in the Democratic primary and local elections in metropolitan and suburban counties are generally decided in the Republican Primary  although there are exceptions  113  114  Alabama s 67 County Sheriffs are elected in partisan races and Democrats still retain the majority of those posts  The current split is 42 Democrats  24 Republicans  and one Independent  Choctaw   115  Full citation needed  However  most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties and the majority of Republican sheriffs preside over more urban suburban and heavily populated counties  116  Two Alabama counties  Montgomery and Calhoun  with a population of over 100 000 have Democratic sheriffs and five Alabama counties with a population of under 75 000 have Republican sheriffs  Autauga  Coffee  Dale  Coosa  and Blount   117  The state has one female sheriff  Morgan  and nine African American sheriffs  118  Full citation needed   edit  Federal elections The state s two U S  senators are Jefferson B  Sessions III and Richard C  Shelby  both Republicans  In the U S  House of
