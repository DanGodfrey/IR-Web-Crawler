of Belarus  Until the 20th century  the lands of modern day Belarus belonged to several countries  including the Principality of Polotsk  the Grand Duchy of Lithuania  the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth  and the Russian Empire  In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution  Belarus became a founding constituent republic of the Soviet Union and was renamed as the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic  BSSR   The borders of Belarus took their modern shape in 1939 when some lands of the Second Polish Republic were incorporated into it after the Soviet invasion of Poland  9  10  11  12  13  14  The nation and its territory were devastated in World War II  during which Belarus lost about a third of its population and more than half of its economic resources  15  The republic was redeveloped in the post war years  In 1945 the Belorussian SSR became a founding member of the United Nations  along with the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR  The parliament of the republic declared the sovereignty of Belarus on 27 July 1990  and during the dissolution of the Soviet Union  Belarus declared independence on 25 August 1991  Alexander Lukashenko has been the country s president since 1994  Despite objections from Western governments  Lukashenko has continued Soviet era policies  such as state ownership of the economy  According to some organizations and countries  elections have been unfair  and political opponents have been violently suppressed  16  17  18  In 2000  Belarus and Russia signed a treaty for greater cooperation  with some hints of forming a Union

White Russia   White Rus    There are several claims to where the origin of the name  White Rus    came from  20  An ethno religious theory suggests that the name used to describe the part of old Ruthenian lands within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania that had mostly been populated by early Christianized Slavs  as opposed to Black Ruthenia  which was predominantly inhabited by pagan Balts  21  An alternate explanation for the name comments on the white clothing worn by the local Slavic population  20  22  A third theory suggests that the old Ruthenian lands that were not conquered by the Tatars  i e   Polatsk  Vitsiebsk and Mahilyow  had been referred to as  white   Other sources claim that before 1267  the land not conquered by the Mongols was considered  White Rus     20  In 2008  historian Ales Bely defended his PhD thesis  Localization of the Choronym of White Rus  in the European Written and Map Sources of the 13th to mid 18th Centuries  23  which demonstrated that White Rus  originally referred to the area of the Novgorod Republic conquered by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in 1478  in terms of present day geography  this translates to Eastern Belarus and areas acquired via the westward expansion of Muscovy during the Livonian War in the 17th century  The names  Ruthenia  and  Rus    are often conflated with Russia  their modern derivative  and thus White Ruthenia is often referred to as  White Russia   This misinterpretation has been supported by the Moscovite regents after the fall of Kievan Rus   The Moskovite dukes  starting with Ivan IV  considered themselves to be the rightful successors of the Ruthenian grand ducal dynasty  and their use of the name  Russia  as referring to all former Ruthenian  i e   east Slavic  lands became a political weapon and a casus belli for claiming the west Ruthenian territories from Lithuania and Poland  24  The name first appeared in German and Latin medieval literature  the chronicles of Jan of Czarnk w mentions the imprisonment of Lithuanian grand duke Jogaila and his mother at  Albae Russiae  Poloczk dicto  in 1381  25  The Latin term  Alba Russia  was used again by Pope Pius VI to establish a Jesuit society in 1783  His official Papal bull exclaimed  Approbo Societatem Jesu in Alba Russia degentem  approbo  approbo   26  Historically  this territory was referred to in English as  White Ruthenia   The first known use of  White Russia  to refer to Belarus was in the late 16th century by Englishman Sir Jerome Horsey  who was known for his close contacts with the Russian Royal Court  27  During the 17th century  Russian tsars used  White Rus   to describe the lands captured from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania  28  Belarus was formally named  Belorussia   Russian              the latter part similar  but spelled and stressed differently from          Russia   in the days of the Russian Empire  and the Russian tsar was usually styled  Tsar of All the Russias   as  Russia  or the  Russian Empire  was formed by all the Russias   the Great  Little  and White  After the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917  the term White Russia caused some confusion as it was also the name of the military force that opposed the red Bolsheviks  29  During the period of the Belorussian SSR  the term  Byelorussia  was embraced as part of a national consciousness  In western Belarus under Polish control   Byelorussia  became commonly used in the regions of Bia ystok and Grodno during the interwar period  30  The term  Belorussia   its names in other languages such as English being based on the Russian form  was only used officially until 1991  when the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic decreed by law that the new independent republic should be called  Belarus             in Russian in order to reflect the correct Belarusian language forms  The use of Byelorussian SSR and any abbreviations thereof were allowed from 1991 to 1993  31  Conservative forces in the newly independent Belarus did not support the name change and opposed its inclusion in the 1991 draft of the Constitution of Belarus  32  Accordingly  the name  Belorussia  was replaced by  Belarus  in English 33  and to some extent in Russian  although the traditional name still persists in that language as well   likewise  the adjective  Belorussian  or  Byelorussian  was replaced by  Belarusian  in English  though Russian has not developed a new adjective    Belarusian  is closer to the original Russian term of  bielaruski   33  Belarusian intelligentsia in the Stalin era attempted to change the name from  Belorussia  to a form of  Krivia  because of the supposed connection with Russia  34  Some nationalists also object to the name for the same reason  35  36  However  several popular newspapers published locally still retain the old name of the country in Russian in their names  for example Komsomolskaya Pravda v Byelorussii  which is the localized publication of a popular Russian newspaper  Also  those who wish for Belarus to be reunited with Russia continue to use  Belorussia   36  Officially  the full name of the country is  Republic of Belarus

region  From 5 000 to 2 000 BCE  Bandkerimik cultures predominated  In addition  remains for the Dnieper Donets culture were found in Belarus and parts of Ukraine  38 Cimmerians and other pastoralists roamed through the area by 1 000 BCE  and by 500 BCE  Slavs had taken up residence in the area  which was circumscribed by the Scythians who roamed its outskirts  Various Asiatic barbarian by the Huns and Avars swept through c  400 600 CE  but were unable to dislodge the Slavic presence  39  Stamp with the Cross of St  Euphrasyne from 1992 The region that is now Belarus was first settled by Slavic tribes in the 6th century  They gradually came into contact with the Varangians  bands of Scandinavian warriors and traders  40  Though defeated and briefly exiled by the local population  the Varangians were later asked to return 40  and helped to form a polity commonly referred to as the Kievan Rus  in exchange for tribute  The state of Kievan Rus  originated in 862 in the vicinity of either Kiev 41  or the present day city of Novgorod  41  Upon the death of Kievan Rus  ruler Yaroslav I the Wise  the state split into independent principalities  42  These Ruthenian principalities were badly affected by a Mongol invasion in the 13th century  and many were later incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania  43  Of the principalities held by the Duchy  nine were settled by ancestors of the Belarusian people  44  During this time the Duchy was involved in several military campaigns  including fighting on the side of Poland against the Teutonic Knights at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410  the joint victory allowed the Duchy to control the northwestern borderlands of Eastern Europe  45  Position of Grand Duchy of Lithuania in Eastern Europe until 1434  Map of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania  Belarus was within its borders  On 2 February 1386  the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland were joined in a personal union through a marriage of their rulers  46  This union set in motion the developments that eventually resulted in the formation of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth  created in 1569  The Russians  led by Ivan III of Moscow  began military conquests in 1486 in an attempt to reunite the lands of Kievan Rus   specifically the territories of Belarus and Ukraine  47  The union between Poland and Lithuania ended in 1795 with the partitioning of Poland by Imperial Russia  Prussia  and Austria  48  During this time the territories of Belarus were acquired by the Russian Empire under the reign of Catherine II 49  and held until their occupation by German Empire during World War I  50   edit  Since initial independence During the negotiations of the Treaty of Brest Litovsk  Belarus first declared independence under German occupation on 25 March 1918  forming the Belarusian People s Republic  51  52  Immediately afterwards  the Polish Soviet War ignited  and Belarus found itself torn between resurgent Poland and Soviet Russia  A part of Belarus under Russian rule emerged as the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1919  Soon thereafter it merged to form the Lithuanian Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic  The contested lands were divided between Poland and the Soviet Union after the war ended in 1921  and the Belorussian SSR became a founding member of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1922  51

Council officially took control of the territories  whose populations were predominantly ethnic Belarusians  on 28 October 1939 in Bia ystok  14  Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941  The Brest Fortress  which had been annexed in 1939  was subjected to one of the most destructive onslaughts and its notable defense in 1941 was memorialized as an act of heroism in countering German aggression  Statistically  BSSR was the hardest hit Soviet republic in World War II and remained in Nazi hands until 1944  During that time  Germany destroyed 209 out of 290 cities in the republic  85  of the republic s industry  and more than one million buildings  15  Casualties were estimated to be between two and three million  about a quarter to one third of the total population   while the Jewish population of Belarus was devastated during the Holocaust and never recovered  15  56  The population of Belarus did not regain its pre war level until 1971  56  After the war  Belarus was among the 51 founding countries of the United Nations Charter and as such it was allowed an additional vote at the UN  on top of the Soviet Union s vote  Vigorous postwar reconstruction promptly followed the end of the war and Belorussian SSR became a major center of manufacturing in western USSR  creating jobs and attracting ethnic Russians  57  The borders of Belorussian SSR and Poland were redrawn and became known as the Curzon Line  58  Map of the Belorussian SSR  1940 Joseph Stalin implemented a policy of Sovietization to isolate the Belorussian SSR from Western influences  56  This policy involved sending Russians from various parts of the Soviet Union and placing them in key positions in the Belorussian SSR government  The official use of the Belarusian language and other cultural aspects were limited by Moscow  After Stalin s death in 1953  Nikita Khrushchev continued his predecessor s cultural hegemony program  stating   The sooner we all start speaking Russian  the faster we shall build communism   56  In 1986  the Belorussian SSR was significantly exposed to nuclear fallout from the explosion at the Chernobyl power plant in neighboring Ukrainian SSR  59  In June 1988  archaeologist and leader of the Christian Conservative Party of the BPF Zyanon Paznyak discovered mass graves of victims executed in 1937 41 at Kurapaty  near Minsk  59  Some nationalists contend that this discovery is proof that the Soviet government was trying to erase the Belarusian people  causing Belarusian nationalists to seek independence  60  In March 1990  elections for seats in the Supreme Soviet of the Belorussian SSR took place  Though the pro independence Belarusian Popular Front took only 10  of the seats  the populace was content with the selection of the delegates
