Germanic speaking area of the Holy Roman Empire around 962  The history of the language begins with the High German consonant shift during the migration period  separating Old High German dialects from Old Saxon  The earliest testimonies of Old High German are from scattered Elder Futhark inscriptions  especially in Alemannic  from the 6th century AD  the earliest glosses  Abrogans  date to the 8th  and the oldest coherent texts  the Hildebrandslied  the Muspilli and the Merseburg Incantations  to the 9th century  Old Saxon at this time belongs to the North Sea Germanic cultural sphere  and Low Saxon was to fall under German rather than Anglo Frisian influence during the Holy Roman Empire  As Germany was divided into many different states  the only force working for a unification or standardization of German during a period of several hundred years was the general preference of writers trying to write in a way that could be understood in the largest possible area   edit  Modern German When Martin Luther translated the Bible  the New Testament in 1522 and the Old Testament  published in parts and completed in 1534   he based his translation mainly on the bureaucratic standard language used in Saxony  s chsische Kanzleisprache   also known as Mei ner Deutsch  German from the city of Meissen   This language was based on Eastern Upper and Eastern Central German dialects and preserved much of the grammatical system of Middle High German  unlike the spoken German dialects in Central and Upper Germany  which already at that time began to lose the genitive case and the preterit   In the beginning  copies of the Bible had a long list for each region  which translated words unknown in the region into the regional dialect  Roman Catholics rejected Luther s translation in the beginning and tried to create their own Catholic standard  gemeines Deutsch  which  however  differed from  Protestant German  only in some minor details  It took until the middle of the 18th century to create a standard that was widely accepted  thus ending the period of Early New High German  Ethno linguistic map of Austria Hungary  1910  Until about 1800  standard German was almost only a written language  At this time  people in urban northern Germany  who spoke dialects very different from Standard German  learned it almost like a foreign language and tried to pronounce it as closely to the spelling as possible  Prescriptive pronunciation guides used to consider northern German pronunciation to be the standard  However  the actual pronunciation of Standard German varies from region to region  German was the language of commerce and government in the Habsburg Empire  which encompassed a large area of Central and Eastern Europe  Until the mid 19th century it was essentially the language of townspeople throughout most of the Empire  It indicated that the speaker was a merchant  an urbanite  not their nationality  Some cities  such as Prague  German  Prag  and Budapest  Buda  German  Ofen   were gradually Germanized in the years after their incorporation into the Habsburg domain  Others  such as Bratislava  German  Pressburg   were originally settled during the Habsburg period and were primarily German at that time  A few cities such as Milan  German  Mailand  remained primarily non German  However  most cities were primarily German during this time  such as Prague  Budapest  Bratislava  Zagreb  German  Agram   and Ljubljana  German  Laibach   though they were surrounded by territory that spoke other languages  German language and ethnicity in central Europe  1929  In 1901  the 2nd Orthographical Conference ended with a complete standardization of German language in its written form while the Deutsche B hnensprache  literally  German stage language  had already established rules for German three years earlier  which were later to become obligatory for general German pronunciation citation needed   Media and written works are now almost all produced in Standard German  often called Hochdeutsch in German  which is understood in all areas where German is spoken  The first dictionary of the Brothers Grimm  the 16 parts of which were issued between 1852 and 1860  remains the most comprehensive guide to the words of the German language  In 1860  grammatical and orthographic rules first appeared in the Duden Handbook  In 1901  this was declared the standard definition of the German language  Official revisions of some of these rules were not issued until 1998  when the German spelling reform of 1996 was officially promulgated by governmental representatives of all German speaking countries  Since the reform  German spelling has been in an eight year transitional period dated info  during which the reformed spelling is taught in most schools  while traditional and reformed spellings co exist in the media  See German spelling reform of 1996 for an overview of the public debate concerning the reform  with some major newspapers and magazines and several known writers refusing to adopt it   edit  Reform of 1996 The German spelling reform of 1996 led to public controversy and considerable dispute  Some states  Bundesl nder  would not accept it  North Rhine Westphalia and Bavaria   The dispute landed at one point in the highest court  which made a short issue of it  claiming that the states had to decide for themselves and that only in schools could the reform be made the official rule everybody else could continue writing as they had learned it  After 10 years  without any intervention by the federal parliament  a major revision was installed in 2006  just in time for the coming school year  In 2007  some traditional spellings were finally invalidated  The most noticeable change was probably the use of the letter    called scharfes s or ess zett  pronounced ess tsett   Traditionally  this letter was used in three situations  1  after a long vowel or vowel combination  2  before a t  and 3  at the end of a syllable  thus F  e  pa t  and da   Currently only the first rule is in effect  thus F  e  passt  and dass  The word Fu   foot  has the letter   because it contains a long vowel  even though that letter occurs at the end of a syllable   edit  Geographic distribution Main article  German diaspora German speaking communities can be found in the former German colony of Namibia  independent from South Africa since 1990  as well as in the other countries of German emigration such as the US  Canada  Mexico  Dominican Republic  Brazil  Argentina  Paraguay  Uruguay  Chile  Peru

in Northern Italy  in South Tyrol and in some municipalities in other provinces   in the East Cantons of Belgium  in the French regions of Alsace and Lorraine  and in some border villages of the former South Jutland County of Denmark  German speaking communities can also be found in parts of the Czech Republic  Slovakia  Hungary  Poland  Romania  Serbia  Russia and Kazakhstan  In Russia  forced expulsions after World War II and massive emigration to Germany in the 1980s and 1990s have depopulated most of these communities   edit  South America In Brazil the largest concentrations of German speakers are in Rio Grande do Sul  where Riograndenser Hunsr ckisch developed   Santa Catarina  Paran   S o Paulo and Esp rito Santo  There are also important concentrations of German speaking descendants in Argentina  Venezuela  Paraguay and Chile  In the 20th century  over 100 000 German political refugees and invited entrepreneurs settled in Latin America  in countries such as Costa Rica  Panama  Venezuela  and the Dominican Republic  to establish German speaking enclaves  and reportedly there is a small German immigration to Puerto Rico  Nearly all inhabitants of the city of Pomerode in the state of Santa Catarina in Brazil can speak German  However  in most other locations where German immigrants settled  the vast majority of their descendents no longer speak German  as they have been largely assimilated into the host language and culture of the specific location of settlement  generally English in North America  and Spanish  or Portuguese in Latin America   edit  North America Main articles  German in the United States  Pennsylvania German  Plautdietsch  and Hutterite German In the United States  the states of North Dakota and South Dakota are the only states where German is the most common language spoken at home after English  the second most spoken language in other states is either Spanish or French   22  An indication of the German presence can be found in the names of such places as New Ulm and many other towns in Minnesota  Bismarck  state capital   Munich  Karlsruhe  and Strasburg in North Dakota  New Braunfels and Muenster in Texas  and Kiel  Berlin and Germantown in Wisconsin  Between 1843 and 1910  more than 5 million Germans emigrated overseas  23  mostly to the United States  24  German remained an important medium for churches  schools  newspapers  and even the administration of the United States Brewers  Association 25  through the early 20th century  but was severely repressed during World War I  Over the course of the 20th century many of the descendants of 18th century and 19th century immigrants ceased speaking German at home  but small populations of elderly  as well as some younger  speakers can be found in Pennsylvania  Amish  Hutterites  Dunkards and some Mennonites historically spoke Hutterite German and a West Central German variety of German known as Pennsylvania Dutch   Kansas  Mennonites and Volga Germans   North Dakota  Hutterite Germans  Mennonites  Russian Germans  Volga Germans  and Baltic Germans   South Dakota  Montana  Texas  Texas German   Wisconsin  Indiana  Oregon  Louisiana and Oklahoma  A significant group of German Pietists in Iowa formed the Amana Colonies and continue to practice speaking their heritage language  Early twentieth century immigration was often to St  Louis  Chicago  New York  Milwaukee  Pittsburgh and Cincinnati  German language newspapers in the U S  in 1922 In Canada  there are 622 650 speakers of German according to the most recent census in 2006  21  while people of German ancestry  German Canadians  are found throughout the country  German speaking communities are particularly found in British Columbia  118 035  and Ontario  230 330   21  There is a large and vibrant community in the city of Kitchener  Ontario  which was at one point named Berlin  German immigrants were instrumental in the country s three largest urban areas  Montreal  Toronto  and Vancouver  while post Second World War immigrants managed to preserve a fluency in the German language in their respective neighborhoods and sections  In the first half of the 20   century  over a million German Canadians made the language Canada s third most spoken after French and English  In Mexico there are also large populations of German ancestry  mainly in the cities of  Mexico City  Puebla  Mazatl n  Tapachula  Ecatepec de Morelos  and larger populations scattered in the states of Chihuahua  Durango  and Zacatecas  German ancestry is also said to be found in neighboring towns around Guadalajara  Jalisco and much of Northern Mexico  where German influence was immersed into the Mexican culture  Standard German is spoken by the affluent German communities in Puebla  Mexico City  Nuevo Le n  San Luis Potos  and Quintana Roo  The dialects of German which are or were primarily spoken in colonies or communities founded by German speaking people resemble the dialects of the regions the founders came from  For example  Pennsylvania German resembles Palatinate German dialects  and Hutterite German resembles dialects of Carinthia  Texas German is a dialect spoken in the areas of Texas settled by the Adelsverein  such as New Braunfels and Fredericksburg  In the Amana Colonies in the state of Iowa  Amana German is spoken  Plautdietsch is a large minority language spoken in Northern Mexico by the Mennonite communities  and is spoken by more than 200 000 people in Mexico  Pennsylvania Dutch is a dialect of German spoken by the Amish population of Pennsylvania  Indiana  and Ohio  Hutterite German is an Upper German dialect of the Austro Bavarian variety of the German language  which is spoken by Hutterite communities in Canada and the United States  Hutterite is spoken in the U S  states of Washington  Montana  North Dakota  South Dakota  and Minnesota  and in the Canadian provinces of Alberta  Saskatchewan and Manitoba  Its speakers belong to some Schmiedleit  Lehrerleit  and Dariusleit Hutterite groups  but there are also speakers among the older generations of Prairieleit  the descendants of those Hutterites who chose not to settle in colonies   Hutterite children who grow up in the colonies learn to speak Hutterite German before learning English  the standard language of the surrounding areas  in school  Many of these children  though  continue with German Grammar School  in addition to public school  throughout a student s elementary education  citation needed   edit  Australia In Australia  the state of South Australia experienced a pronounced wave of immigration in the 1840s from Prussia  particularly the Silesia region   With the prolonged isolation from other German speakers and contact with Australian English some have suggested a unique dialect formed known as Barossa German spoken predominantly in the Barossa Valley near Adelaide  Usage sharply declined with the advent of World War I  due to the prevailing anti German sentiment in the population and related government action  It continued to be used as a first language into the twentieth century but now its use is limited to a few older speakers  citation needed   edit  Asia There is also an important German creole being studied and recovered  named Unserdeutsch  spoken in the former German colony of Papua New Guinea  across Micronesia and in northern Australia  i e  coastal parts of Queensland and Western Australia   by a few elderly people  The risk of its extinction is serious and efforts to revive interest in the language are being implemented by scholars   edit  Standard German Main article  Standard German The national and regional standard varieties of the German language  26  Standard German originated not as a traditional dialect of a specific region  but as a written language  However  there are places where the traditional regional dialects have been replaced by standard German  this is the case in vast stretches of Northern Germany  but also in major cities in other parts of the country  Standard German differs regionally  between German speaking countries  in vocabulary and some instances of pronunciation  and even grammar and orthography  This variation must not be confused with the variation of local dialects   Even though the regional varieties of standard German are only to a certain degree influenced by the local dialects  they are very distinct  German is thus considered a pluricentric language  In most regions  the speakers use a continuum of mixtures from more dialectal varieties to more standard varieties according to situation  In the German speaking parts of Switzerland  mixtures of dialect and standard are very seldom used  and the use of standard German is largely restricted to the written language  Therefore  this situation has been called a medial diglossia  Swiss Standard German is used in the Swiss  Austrian Standard German officially in the Austrian education system   edit  Official status Standard German is the only official language in Liechtenstein  it shares official status in Germany  with Danish  Frisian  Romany and Sorbian as

people in Europe  as of 2004   or 13 3  of all Europeans  being the second most spoken native language in Europe after Russian  above French  66 5 million speakers in 2004  and English  64 2 million speakers in 2004   It is therefore the most spoken first language in the EU  It is the second most known foreign language in the EU  29  It is one of the official languages of the European Union  and one of the three working languages of the European Commission  along with English and French  Thirty two percent of citizens of the EU 15 countries say they can converse in German  either as a mother tongue or as a second or foreign language   30  This is assisted by the widespread availability of German TV by cable or satellite   edit  Dialects Main article  German dialects Distribution of the native speakers of major continental West Germanic dialectal varieties  citation needed  German is a member of the western branch of the Germanic family of languages  which in turn is part of the Indo European language family  The German dialect continuum is traditionally divided most broadly into High German and Low German  The variation among the German dialects is considerable  with only the neighboring dialects being mutually intelligible  Some dialects are not intelligible to people who only know standard German  However  all German dialects belong to the dialect continuum of High German and Low Saxon languages   edit  Low German Main article  Low German Middle Low German was the lingua franca of the Hanseatic League  It was the predominant language in Northern Germany  This changed in the 16th century  when in 1534 the Luther Bible by Martin Luther was printed  This translation is considered to be an important step towards the evolution of the Early New High German  It aimed to be understandable to a broad audience and was based mainly on Central and Upper German varieties  The Early New High German language gained more prestige than Low German and became the language of science and literature  Other factors were that around the same time  the Hanseatic league lost its importance as new trade routes to Asia and the Americas were established  and that the most powerful German states of that period were located in Middle and Southern Germany  The 18th and 19th centuries were marked by mass education of Standard German in schools  Slowly  Low German was politically viewed as nothing but a dialect language spoken by the uneducated  Today Low Saxon can be divided in two groups  Low Saxon varieties with a reasonable standard German influx and varieties of Standard German with a Low Saxon influence known as Missingsch  Sometimes  Low Saxon and Low Franconian varieties are grouped together because both are unaffected by the High German consonant shift  However  the part of the population capable of speaking and responding to it  or of understanding it has decreased continuously since World War II   edit  High German Main article  High German languages High German is divided into Central German  High Franconian  a transitional dialect   and Upper German  Central German dialects include Ripuarian  Moselle Franconian  Rhine Franconian  Central Hessian  East Hessian  North Hessian  Thuringian  Silesian German  Lorraine Franconian  Mittelalemannisch  North Upper Saxon  High Prussian  Lausitzisch Neum rkisch and Upper Saxon  It is spoken in the southeastern Netherlands  eastern Belgium  Luxembourg  parts of France  and parts of Germany approximately between the River Main and the southern edge of the Lowlands  Modern Standard German is mostly based on Central German  but it should be noted that the common  but not linguistically correct  German term for modern Standard German is Hochdeutsch  that is  High German  The Moselle Franconian varieties spoken in Luxembourg have been officially standardised and institutionalised and are therefore usually considered a separate language known as Luxembourgish  The two High Franconian dialects are East Franconian and South Franconian  Upper German dialects include Northern Austro Bavarian  Central Austro Bavarian  Southern Austro Bavarian  Swabian  East Franconian  High Alemannic German  Highest Alemannic German  Alsatian and Low Alemannic German  They are spoken in parts of the Alsace  southern Germany  Liechtenstein  Austria  and the German speaking parts of Switzerland and Italy  Vilamovian is a High German dialect of Poland  and Sathmarisch and Siebenb rgisch are High German dialects of Romania  The High German varieties spoken by Ashkenazi Jews  mostly in the former Soviet Union  have several unique features  and are usually considered as a separate language  Yiddish  It is the only Germanic language that does not use the Latin script as the basis of its standard alphabet   edit  Varieties of standard German In German linguistics  German dialects are distinguished from varieties of standard German  The German dialects are the traditional local varieties  They are traditionally traced back to the different German tribes  Many of them are hardly understandable to someone who knows only standard German  since they often differ from standard German in lexicon  phonology and syntax  If a narrow definition of language based on mutual intelligibility is used  many German dialects are considered to be separate languages  for instance in the Ethnologue   However  such a point of view is unusual in German linguistics  The varieties of standard German refer to the different local varieties of the pluricentric standard German  They only differ slightly in lexicon and phonology  In certain regions  they have replaced the traditional German dialects  especially in Northern Germany   edit  Grammar Main article  German grammar German is an inflected language with three grammatical genders  as such  there can be a large number of words derived from the same root   edit  Noun inflection German nouns inflect into  one of four cases  nominative  genitive  dative  and accusative  one of three genders  masculine  feminine  or neuter  Word endings sometimes reveal grammatical gender  for instance  nouns ending in    ung  ing      schaft   ship      keit or    heit   hood  are feminine  while nouns ending in    chen or    lein  diminutive forms  are neuter and nouns ending in    ismus   ism  are masculine  Others are controversial  sometimes depending on the region in which it is spoken  Additionally  ambiguous endings exist  such as    er   er   e g  Feier  feminine   Eng  celebration  party  Arbeiter  masculine   Eng  labourer  and Gewitter  neuter   Eng  thunderstorm  two numbers  singular and plural Although German is usually cited as an outstanding example of a highly inflected language  the degree of inflection is considerably less than in Old High German or in other old Indo European languages such as Latin  Ancient Greek  or Sanskrit  or  for instance  in modern Icelandic or Russian  The three genders have collapsed in the plural  which now behaves  grammatically  somewhat as a fourth gender  With four cases and three genders plus plural there are 16 distinct possible combinations of case and gender number  but presently there are only six forms of the definite article used for the 16 possibilities  Inflection for case on the noun itself is required in the singular for strong masculine and neuter nouns in the genitive and sometimes in the dative  Both of these cases are losing way to substitutes in informal speech  The dative ending is considered somewhat old fashioned in many contexts and often dropped  but it is still used in sayings and in formal speech or in written language  Weak masculine nouns share a common case ending for genitive  dative and accusative in the singular  Feminines are not declined in the singular  The plural does have an inflection for the dative  In total  seven inflectional endings  not counting plural markers  exist in German   s   es   n   ns   en   ens   e  In the German orthography  nouns and most words with the syntactical function of nouns are capitalised  which is supposed to make it easier for readers to find out what function a word has within the sentence  Am Freitag ging ich einkaufen   On Friday I went shopping    Eines Tages kreuzte er endlich auf   One day he finally showed up    This convention is almost unique to German today  shared perhaps only by the closely related Luxemburgish language and several insular dialects of the North Frisian language   although it was historically common in other languages such as Danish and English  Like most Germanic languages  German forms noun compounds where the first noun modifies the category given by the second  for example  Hundeh tte  Eng  dog hut  specifically  doghouse   Unlike English  where newer compounds or combinations of longer nouns are often written in open form with separating spaces  German  like the other German languages  nearly always uses the closed form without spaces  for example  Baumhaus  Eng  tree house   Like English  German allows arbitrarily long compounds  but these are rare   See also English compounds   The longest German word verified to be actually in  albeit very limited  use is Rindfleischetikettierungs berwachungsaufgaben bertragungsgesetz  which  literally translated  is  beef labelling supervision duty assignment law   from Rind  cattle   Fleisch  meat   Etikettierung s   labelling    berwachung s   supervision   Aufgaben  duties    bertragung s   assignment   Gesetz  law     edit  Verb inflection Main article  German verbs Standard German verbs inflect into  one of primarily two conjugation classes  weak and strong  as in English   Additionally  there is a third class  known as mixed verbs  which exhibit inflections combining features of both the strong and weak patterns  three persons  1st  2nd  3rd  two numbers  singular and plural three moods  indicative  imperative  subjunctive two voices  active and passive  the passive being composed and dividable into static and dynamic  two non composed tenses  present  preterite  and four composed tenses  perfect  pluperfect  future and future perfect  distinction between grammatical aspects is rendered by combined use of subjunctive and or preterite marking  thus  neither of both is plain indicative voice  sole subjunctive conveys second hand information  subjunctive plus preterite marking forms the conditional state  and sole preterite is either plain indicative  in the past   or functions as a  literal  alternative for either second hand information or the conditional state of the verb  when one of them may seem indistinguishable otherwise  distinction between perfect and progressive aspect is and has at every stage of development been at hand as a productive category of the older language and in nearly all documented dialects  but  strangely enough  is nowadays rigorously excluded from written usage in its present normalised form  disambiguation of completed vs  uncompleted forms is widely observed and regularly generated by common prefixes  blicken   to look  erblicken   to see  unrelated form  sehen   to see    Verb prefixes The meaning of base verbs can be expanded  and sometimes radically changed  through the use of any number of prefixes  Some prefixes have a meaning themselves  the prefix zer  refers to the destruction of things  as in zerrei en  to tear apart   zerbrechen  to break apart   zerschneiden  to cut apart   Others do not have more than the vaguest meaning in and of themselves  the use of ver  is found in a number of verbs with a large variety of meanings  as in versuchen  to try   vernehmen  to interrogate   verteilen  to distribute   verstehen  to understand   Other examples include haften  to stick   verhaften  to detain   kaufen  to buy   verkaufen  to sell   h ren  to hear   aufh ren  to cease   fahren  to drive   erfahren  to experience   Many German verbs have a separable prefix  often with an adverbial function  In finite verb forms this is split off and moved to the end of the clause  and is hence considered by some to be a  resultative particle   For example  mitgehen meaning  to go along  would be split  giving Gehen Sie mit   Literal   Go you with     Formal   Are you going along     Indeed  several parenthetical clauses may occur between the prefix of a finite verb and its complement  e g  Er kam am Freitagabend nach einem harten Arbeitstag und dem  blichen  rger  der ihn schon seit Jahren immer wieder an seinem Arbeitsplatz plagt  mit fraglicher Freude auf ein Mahl  das seine Frau ihm  wie er hoffte  bereits aufgetischt hatte  endlich zu Hause an   A literal translation of this example might look like this  He  rived on Friday evening  after a hard day at work and the usual annoyances that had been repeatedly troubling him for years now at his workplace  with questionable joy  to a meal which  as he hoped  his wife had already served him  finally at home ar    edit  Word order Word order is generally less rigid than in Modern English  There are two common word orders  one is for main clauses and another for subordinate clauses  In normal affirmative sentences the inflected verb always has position 2  In polar questions  exclamations  and wishes it always has position 1  In subordinate clauses the verb is supposed to occur at the very end  but in speech this rule is often disregarded  German requires that a verbal element  main verb or auxiliary verb  appear second in the sentence  The verb is preceded by the topic of the sentence  The element in focus appears at the end of the sentence  For a sentence without an auxiliary this gives  amongst other options  Der alte Mann gab mir gestern das Buch   The old man gave me yesterday the book  normal order  Das Buch gab mir gestern der alte Mann   The book gave  to  me yesterday the old man  Das Buch gab der alte Mann mir gestern   The book gave the old man  to  me yesterday  Gestern gab mir der alte Mann das Buch   Yesterday gave  to  me the old man the book  normal order  Mir gab der alte Mann das Buch gestern    To  me gave the old man the book yesterday  entailing  as for you  it was another date   The position of a noun in a German sentence has no bearing on its being a subject  an object  or another argument  In a declarative sentence in English if the subject does not occur before the predicate the sentence could well be misunderstood  This is not the case in German  Auxiliary verbs When an auxiliary verb is present  the auxiliary appears in second position  and the main verb appears at the end  This occurs notably in the creation of the perfect  Many word orders are still possible  e g   Der alte Mann hat mir heute das Buch gegeben   The old man has given me the book today   Das Buch hat der alte Mann mir heute gegeben   The book has the old man given me today   Heute hat der alte Mann mir das Buch gegeben   Today the old man has given me the book   Modal verbs Sentences using modal verbs place the infinitive at the end  For example  the sentence in Modern English  Should he go home   would be rearranged in German to say  Should he  to  home go    Soll er nach Hause gehen    Thus in sentences with several subordinate or relative clauses the infinitives are clustered at the end  Compare the similar clustering of prepositions in the following English sentence   What did you bring that book which I don t like to be read to out of up for   Multiple infinitives German subordinate clauses have all verbs clustered at the end  Given that auxiliaries encode future  passive  modality  and the perfect  this can lead to very long chains of verbs at the end of the sentence  In these constructions  the past participle in ge  is often replaced by the infinitive  Man nimmt an  dass der Deserteur wohl erschossenV wordenpsv seinperf solltemod One suspects that the deserter probably shot become be should   It is suspected that the deserter probably should have been shot   The order at the end of such strings is subject to variation  though the latter version is unusual  Er wusste nicht  dass der Agent einen Nachschl ssel hatte machen lassen He knew not that the agent a picklock had make let Er wusste nicht  dass der Agent einen Nachschl ssel machen lassen hatte He knew not that the agent a picklock make let had   He did not know that the agent had had a picklock made    edit  Vocabulary Duden Universal W rterbuch Most German vocabulary is derived from the Germanic branch of the Indo European language family  although there are significant minorities of words derived from Latin and Greek  and a smaller amount from French 31  and most recently English  32  At the same time  the effectiveness of the German language in forming equivalents for foreign words from its inherited Germanic stem repertory is great  citation needed  Thus  Notker Labeo was able to translate Aristotelian treatises in pure  Old High  German in the decades after the year 1000  Overall  German has fewer Romance language loanwords than English or even Dutch  Even today  many low key non academic movements try to promote the Ersatz  substitution  of virtually all foreign words with ancient  dialectal  or neologous German alternatives  33  It is claimed that this would also help in spreading modern or scientific notions among the less educated  and thus democratise public life  too  The modern German scientific vocabulary has nine million words and word groups  based on the analysis of 35 million sentences of a corpus in Leipzig  which as of July 2003 included 500 million words in total   34   edit  Literature Main article  German literature The German language is used in German literature and can be traced back to the Middle Ages  with the most notable authors of the period being Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach  The Nibelungenlied  whose author remains unknown  is also an important work of the epoch  as is the Thidrekssaga  The fairy tales collections collected and published by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in the 19th century became famous throughout the world  Theologian Luther  who translated the Bible into German  is widely credited for having set the basis for the modern  High German  language  Among the most well known German poets and authors are Lessing  Goethe  Schiller  Kleist  Hoffmann  Brecht  Heine and Schmidt  Thirteen German speaking people have won the Nobel Prize in literature  Theodor Mommsen  Rudolf Christoph Eucken  Paul von Heyse  Gerhart Hauptmann  Carl Spitteler  Thomas Mann  Nelly Sachs  Hermann Hesse  Heinrich B ll  Elias Canetti  G nter Grass  Elfriede Jelinek and Herta M ller  Johann Wolfgang v  Goethe 1749 1832  Friedrich Schiller 1759 1805  Brothers Grimm 1785 1863  Thomas Mann 1875 1955  Hermann Hesse 1877 1962   edit  Orthography Main articles  German orthography and German alphabet German alphabet in handwritten conventions German is written in the Latin alphabet  In addition to the 26 standard letters  German has three vowels with Umlaut  namely      and    as well as the Eszett or scharfes s  sharp s      Written texts in German are easily recognisable as such by distinguishing features such as umlauts and certain orthographical features German is the only major language that capitalizes all nouns and the frequent occurrence of long compounds  the longest German word is made of 79 characters    edit  Present Before the German spelling reform of 1996    replaced ss after long vowels and diphthongs and before consonants  word   or partial word endings  In reformed spelling    replaces ss only after long vowels and diphthongs  Since there is no capital    it is always written as SS when capitalization is required  For example  Ma band  tape measure  is capitalized MASSBAND  An exception is the use of   in legal documents and forms when capitalizing names  To avoid confusion with similar names  a     is to be used instead of  SS    So   KRE LEIN  instead of  KRESSLEIN    A capital   has been proposed and included in Unicode  but it is not yet recognized as standard German  In Switzerland    is not used at all  Umlaut vowels           are commonly transcribed with ae  oe  and ue if the umlauts are not available on the keyboard used  In the same manner   can be transcribed as ss  Some operating systems use key sequences to extend the set of possible characters to include  amongst other things  umlauts  in Microsoft Windows this is done using Alt codes  German readers understand those transcriptions  although they look unusual   but they are avoided if the regular umlauts are available because they are considered a makeshift  not proper spelling   In Westphalia and Schleswig Holstein  city and family names exist where the extra e has a vowel lengthening effect  e g  Raesfeld   ra sf lt   Coesfeld   ko sf lt  and Itzehoe   ts  ho    but this use of the letter e after a o u does not occur in the present day spelling of words other than proper nouns   German alphabet  Listen to a German speaker recite the alphabet in German  Problems listening to this file  See media help  There is no general agreement on where these umlauts occur in the sorting sequence  Telephone directories treat them by replacing them with the base vowel followed by an e  Some dictionaries sort each umlauted vowel as a separate letter after the base vowel  but more commonly words with umlauts are ordered immediately after the same word without umlauts  As an example in a telephone book  rzte occurs after Adressenverlage but before Anlagenbauer  because   is replaced by Ae   In a dictionary  rzte comes after Arzt  but in some dictionaries  rzte and all other words starting with     may occur after all words starting with  A   In some older dictionaries or indexes  initial Sch and St are treated as separate letters and are listed as separate entries after S  but they are usually treated as S C H and S T  Written German also typically uses an alternative opening inverted comma  quotation mark  as in  Guten Morgen     edit  Past Further information  2nd Orthographic Conference  German   Antiqua Fraktur dispute  German orthography reform of 1944  and German orthography reform of 1996 Until the early twentieth century  German was mostly printed in blackletter typefaces  mostly in Fraktur  but also in Schwabacher  and written in corresponding handwriting  for example Kurrent and S tterlin   These variants of the Latin alphabet are very different from the serif or sans serif Antiqua typefaces used today  and particularly the handwritten forms are difficult for the untrained to read  The printed forms however were claimed by some to be actually more readable when used for printing Germanic languages  35  The Nazis initially promoted Fraktur and Schwabacher since they were considered Aryan  although they later abolished them in 1941 by claiming that these letters were Jewish  The Fraktur script remains present in everyday life through road signs  pub signs  beer brands and other forms of advertisement  where it is used to convey a certain rusticality and oldness  A proper use of the long s   langes s   ſ  is essential to write German text in Fraktur typefaces  Many Antiqua typefaces include the long s  also  A specific set of rules applies for the use of long s in German text  but it is rarely used in Antiqua typesetting  recently  Any lower case  s  at the beginning of a syllable would be a long s  as opposed to a terminal s or short s  the more common variation of the letter s   which marks the end of a syllable  for example  in differentiating between the words Wachſtube   guard house  and Wachstube   tube of floor polish   One can decide which  s  to use by appropriate hyphenation  easily   Wach ſtube  vs   Wachs tube    The long s only appears in lower case   edit  Phonology Main article  German phonology  edit  Vowels Spoken German in Goethe s Faust German vowels  excluding diphthongs  see below  come in short and long varieties  as detailed in the following table  A   E I O   U   short  a                                   long  a         e    i    o         u    y   Short     is realized as     in stressed syllables  including secondary stress   but as     in unstressed syllables  Note that stressed short     can be spelled either with e or with    h tte  would have  and Kette  chain   for instance  rhyme   In general  the short vowels are open and the long vowels are closed  The one exception is the open      sound of long    in some varieties of standard German       and  e   have merged into  e    removing this anomaly  In that case  pairs like B ren Beeren  bears berries  or  hre Ehre  spike  of wheat  honour  become homophonous  In many varieties of standard German  an unstressed   r  is not pronounced   r   but vocalised to      Whether any particular vowel letter represents the long or short phoneme is not completely predictable  although the following regularities exist  If a vowel  other than i  is at the end of a syllable or followed by a single consonant  it is usually pronounced long  e g  Hof  ho f    If the vowel is followed by a double consonant  e g  ff  ss or tt   ck  tz or a consonant cluster  e g  st or nd   it is nearly always short  e g  hoffen   h f n    Double consonants are used only for this function of marking preceding vowels as short  the consonant itself is never pronounced lengthened or doubled  in other words this is not a feeding order of gemination and then vowel shortening  Both of these rules have exceptions  e g  hat  hat   has  is short despite the first rule  Mond  mo nt    moon  is long despite the second rule   For an i that is neither in the combination ie  making it long  nor followed by a double consonant or cluster  making it short   there is no general rule  In some cases  there are regional differences  In central Germany  Hessen   the o in the proper name  Hoffmann  is pronounced long while most other Germans would pronounce it short  the same applies to the e in the geographical name  Mecklenburg  for people in that region  The word St dte  cities   is pronounced with a short vowel    t t   by some  Jan Hofer  ARD Television  and with a long vowel    t  t   by others  Marietta Slomka  ZDF Television   Finally  a vowel followed by ch can be short  Fach  fax   compartment   K che   k      kitchen   or long  Suche   zu x    search   B cher   by      books   almost at random  Thus  Lache is homographous   Lache   la x    puddle  and  lache   lax    manner of laughing   coll     laugh    Imp    German vowels can form the following digraphs  in writing  and diphthongs  in pronunciation   note that the pronunciation of some of them  ei   u  eu  is very different from what one would expect when considering the component letters  spelling ai  ei  ay  ey au  u  eu pronunciation  a     a          Additionally  the digraph ie generally represents the phoneme  i    which is not a diphthong  In many varieties  an  r  at the end of a syllable is vocalised  However  a sequence of a vowel followed by such a vocalised  r  is not considered a diphthong  B r  b       bear   er  e      he   wir  vi      we   Tor  to      gate   kurz  k   ts   short   W rter  v   t    words   In most varieties of standard German  syllables that begin with a vowel are preceded by a glottal stop       edit  Consonants With approximately 25 phonemes  the German consonant system exhibits an average number of consonants in comparison with other languages  One of the more noteworthy ones is the unusual affricate  p f   The consonant inventory of the standard language is shown below  Bilabial Labiodental Alveolar Postalveolar Palatal Velar Uvular Glottal Plosive p3  b4 t3  d4 k3   4 Affricate pf ts t    d  5 Fricative f  v s  z       5 x1 h Nasal m n   Approximant l j Rhotic r2 1 x  has two allophones   x  and      after back and front vowels  respectively  2 r  has three allophones in free variation   r       and      In the syllable coda  the allophone     is found in many varieties  3 The voiceless stops  p    t    k  are aspirated except when preceded by a sibilant  4 The voiced stops  b    d       are devoiced to  p    t    k   respectively  in word final position  5 d    and     occur only in words of foreign origin  Where a stressed syllable has an initial vowel  it is preceded by      As its presence is predictable from context      is not considered a phoneme  Consonant spellings c standing by itself is not a German letter  In borrowed words  it is usually pronounced  t s   before     u  e  i        y  or  k   before a  o  u  and consonants   The combination ck is  as in English  used to indicate that the preceding vowel is short  ch occurs most often and is pronounced either      after    ai   u  e  ei  eu  i       and consonants  in the diminutive suffix  chen  and at the beginning of a word    x   after a  au  o  u   or  k  at the beginning of a word before a  o  u and consonants  Ch never occurs at the beginning of an originally German word  In borrowed words with initial Ch before bright vowels  Chemie  chemistry  etc        is considered standard  but is itself practically absent from language in use  Upper Germans and Franconians  in the popular  not linguistic sense  will replace them with  k   as German as a whole does before darker vowels and consonants such as in Charakter  Christentum  Middle Germans  saving Franconians  will borrow a     from the French model  Both agree in considering each other s variant  and Upper Germans also the standard in      as particularly awkward and unusual  dsch is pronounced  d     like j in Jungle  but appears in a few loanwords only  f is pronounced  f  as in  father   h is pronounced  h  as in  home  at the beginning of a syllable  After a vowel it is silent and only lengthens the vowel  e g  Reh   roe deer   j is pronounced  j  in Germanic words  Jahr  ja      In younger loanwords  it follows more or less the respective languages  pronunciations  l is always pronounced  l   never       the English  dark L    q only exists in combination with u and appears in both Germanic and Latin words  quer  Qualit t   The digraph qu is pronounced  kv   r is usually pronounced in a guttural fashion  a voiced uvular fricative     or uvular trill      in front of a vowel or consonant  Rasen    a z n   Burg  bu k    In spoken German  however  it is commonly vocalised after a vowel  er being pronounced rather like       Burg  bu k    In some varieties  the r is pronounced as a  tongue tip  r  the alveolar trill  r    s in Germany  is pronounced  z   as in  zebra   if it forms the syllable onset  e g  Sohn  zo n    otherwise  s   e g  Bus  b s    In Austria and Switzerland  it is always pronounced  s   A ss  s  indicates that the preceding vowel is short  st and sp at the beginning of words of German origin are pronounced   t  and   p   respectively     a letter unique to German called scharfes S or Eszett  was a ligature of a double s and of an sz and is always pronounced  s   Originating in Blackletter typeface  it traditionally replaced ss at the end of a syllable  e g  ich muss   ich mu   ich m sste   ich m  te   within a word it contrasts with ss  s  in indicating that the preceding vowel is long  compare in Ma en  in  ma s n   with moderation  and in Massen  in  mas n   in loads    The use of   has recently been limited by the latest German spelling reform and is no longer used for ss after a short vowel  e g   ich mu   and  ich m  te  were always pronounced with a short U     Switzerland and Liechtenstein already abolished it in 1934  36  sch is pronounced      like  sh  in  shine    tion

is notwithstandingly spelt f llen  and the prefix ver   It is also used in loanwords  where it is supposed to be pronounced  v   This pronunciation is retained for example in Vase  Vikar  Viktor  Viper  Ventil  vulg r  and English loanwords  however  pronunciation tends to  f  the further you travel south  They have reached a plain f in Bavaria and Swabia  w is pronounced  v  as in  vacation   e g  was  vas    y only appears in loanwords and is traditionally considered a vowel  z is always pronounced  t s   e g  zog  t so k    A tz indicates that the preceding vowel is short   edit
