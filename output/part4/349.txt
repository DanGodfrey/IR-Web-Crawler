Television 5 2 Film 5 3 Video games 6 References 7 External links  edit  Publishing history The Daily Bugle is featured prominently in most Marvel Comics titles  especially those in which Spider Man is the lead character  In 1996  a three issue  black and white  limited series was printed  Since 2006  Marvel has published a monthly Daily Bugle newspaper reporting on the company s publications and authors  Marvel earlier used the newspaper format to promote Marvel s crossover events Civil War and House of M reporting on storyline events as if the comic book Daily Bugle had come to life  Marvel restored this promotional function for the 2007 death of Captain America   edit  History The Daily Bugle was founded in 1897 and has been published daily ever since  The Daily Bugle is printed in tabloid format like its rival The Daily Globe  The editor and publisher of the Bugle  J  Jonah Jameson  began his journalistic career as a reporter for the Bugle while still in high school  Jameson purchased the then floundering Bugle with inheritance funds  from his recently deceased father in law and turned the paper into a popular success  Other magazines published from time to time include the revived Now magazine and the now defunct Woman magazine  edited by Carol Danvers  J  Jonah Jameson  Inc  purchased the Goodman Building on 39th Street and Second Avenue in 1936 and moved its entire editorial and publishing facilities there  3  Now called the Daily Bugle Building  the office complex is forty six stories tall  and is capped by the Daily Bugle logo in 30 foot  9 1 m  letters on the roof  There are loading docks in the rear of the building  reached by a back alley  Three floors are devoted to the editorial office of the Bugle and two sub basement levels to the printing presses  while the rest of the floors are rented   A panel in issue 105 of The Amazing Spider Man showed the Bugle building located near a street sign at the corner of Madison Avenue and a street in the East Fifties  the second digit was not shown   This suggests that the building may have been relocated at some point   The newspaper is noted for its anti superhero slant  especially concerning Spider Man  whom the paper constantly smears as a part of its editorial policy  However  the Editor in Chief   Robbie  Robertson  the only subordinate to Jameson who is not intimidated by him  has worked to moderate it  More positively  the newspaper has also published important exposes of political corruption and organized crime in the city  and also takes a strong stance in favor of mutant rights  which has led to its being targeted by various criminals and hate groups  Due to declining circulation  Jameson has conceded to Robertson s objections and has created a special feature section of the paper called The Pulse which focuses on superheroes  In addition  the paper also intermittently ran a glossy magazine called Now Magazine  Soon after the team s formation  the New Avengers decided to strike a deal with Jameson regarding exclusive content in exchange for removing the strong anti Spider Man sentiment from the newspaper  to which Jameson agreed  Merely one day later  Jameson broke the spirit  though not the letter  of his agreement with Iron Man  using the headline  a wanted murderer  Wolverine   an alleged ex member of a terrorist organization  Spider Woman  and a convicted heroin dealer  Luke Cage  are just some of the new recruits set to bury the once good name of the Avengers   but refraining from attacking Spider Man  This prompted Jessica Jones to sell the first pictures of her newborn baby to one of the Bugle s competitors instead  In the first issue of Runaways Vol  2  Victor Mancha states in an exchange about Spider Man that  The only people who think he s a criminal are Fox News and the Daily Bugle  And the Bugle is  like  the least respected newspaper in New York City   The paper s major named competitors are The Daily Globe  which implicitly takes a more balanced look at the superhero  Front Line  run by EIC Ben Urich and Sally Floyd  and The Alternative  After Peter Parker revealed he is Spider Man and the Bugle planned to sue him for fraud  the paper itself was put on the defensive with front page accusations from The Globe  with information secretly supplied by Bugle reporter Betty Brant  of libeling the superhero  The adventures of the staff of the newspaper beyond Peter Parker have been depicted in two series  Daily Bugle and The Pulse   edit  The DB After Jameson suffered a near fatal heart attack  his wife sold the Bugle to rival newspaper man Dexter Bennett  who changed the name to The DB  either standing for Dexter Bennett or Daily Bugle   and transformed it into a scandal sheet  2  Since after Brand New Day no one knows the secret identity of Spider Man anymore  the animosity between Jameson and Parker is retconned as a simple financial question  with Jameson s heart attack coming right after a monetary request from Peter  The reputation of the DB since the mention in Runaways has plummeted down because of the new  scandalistic angle Bennett gives it  Several reporters unwilling  or refusing the new course  like Peter himself  are forced to go away  finding a new safe haven in the Front Line  the only magazine willing to accept people fired by Bennett  pursuing a scorched earth policy over them  The villain Electro targeted Dexter Bennett because of a government bailout plan for the financially strapped paper  Spider Man intervened  and during a battle inside the DB offices  the entire building was demolished  bringing an end to the newspaper as well  4  This was not the first time the Daily Bugle building was destroyed  It had been destroyed and rebuilt twice before  once by Graviton and once by the Green Goblin  volume  amp  issue needed  However  the fact that the paper had already been failing financially and the fact that Dexter Bennett was crippled and bankrupted by Electro s attack means that the building will not be rebuilt again  as Betty Brant points out  there s no longer any money for repairs or even any desire to rebuild  4   edit  Front Line Front Line was a newspaper founded and run by Ben Urich and Sally Floyd  The organization was formed in Civil War  Front Line  11 as Frontlines com  The newspaper appeared in the miniseries World War Hulk  Front Line and Siege  Embedded  Originally it was not competitive with the Daily Bugle while Jameson was still in charge  but it became an alternative view to The DB once Bennett took control   edit  Reborn Sometime after the DB s destruction  Jameson  now the mayor of New York  cashed in the DB shares he acquired from Bennet and gave the money to Robbie Robertson  Jameson asked Robertson to remake Front Line  which itself was on hard times  into the new Daily Bugle  5   edit  Fictional staff members  edit  Current Betty Brant  Reporter   Secretary  formerly  6  Abner Abernathy 7  Tom Amos  Reporter
