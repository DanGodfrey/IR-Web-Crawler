western end of Long Island  also inhabited by a Native American people  the Lenape  often referred to in contemporary colonial documents by the Lenape place name for one of the larger native settlements  Canarsee    The first Dutch settlements  established in 1624  were called Midwout  Midwood  and Vlacke Bos  Flatbush   7  The Dutch also purchased land during the 1630s from the Mohawks in present day Gowanus  Red Hook  the Brooklyn Navy Yard  and Bushwick  7  The Village of Breuckelen  named for Breukelen in the province of Utrecht in the Netherlands  was authorized by the Dutch West India Company in 1646  it became the first municipality in what is now New York State  At the time  Breuckelen was part of New Netherland  Other villages which were later incorporated into Brooklyn were Boswijk  Bushwick   Nieuw Utrecht  New Utrecht   and Nieuw Amersfoort  Flatlands   A few houses and cemeteries still bear witness to the Dutch origins of the borough of Brooklyn  including the oldest house of New York City  the Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House in Flatlands  8  The Dutch lost Breuckelen in the British conquest of New Netherland in 1664  In 1683  the reorganized the Province of New York into twelve counties  each of which was sub divided into towns  Over time  the name evolved from Breuckelen  to Brockland  to Brocklin  to Brookline  to Brookland and eventually  to Brooklyn  7  Kings County was one of the original counties  and Brooklyn was one of the original six towns within Kings County  The county was named in honor of King Charles II of England  On August  27 1776  the Battle of Long Island  also called the Battle of Brooklyn  was fought in Kings County  It was the first major battle in the American Revolutionary War following the Declaration of Independence and the largest battle of the entire conflict  While General George Washington s defeat on the battlefield may have cast early doubts on his abilities as a military tactician and leader  he did keep the Continental Army intact with an overnight tactical retreat  across the East River  9  Gravesend established by Lady Deborah Moody New York became the British political and military base of operations in North America  This encouraged the departure of patriots and their sympathizers while attracting loyalist refugees fleeing the other colonies  Loyalists swelled the population of the surrounding area  including Brooklyn  Correspondingly  the region became the focus of General Washington s intelligence activities  see Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War   The British also began to hold American patriot prisoners of war in rotting hulks anchored in Wallabout Bay off Brooklyn  More American prisoners died in these prison ships than the sum of all the American battle

Beach Line in 1878 heralded explosive growth  and  in the space of a decade  the City of Brooklyn annexed the towns of New Lots in 1886  Flatbush  Gravesend  and New Utrecht in 1894  and Flatlands in

city s budget and proposals for land use  In 1989  the Supreme Court of the United States declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional because Brooklyn  the most populous borough  had no greater

vote  decision  10  Since 1990 the Borough President has acted as an advocate for the borough at the mayoral agencies  the City Council  the New York state government  and corporations  Brooklyn s
