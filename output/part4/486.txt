December 14  1799  was the first President of the United States of America  serving from 1789 to 1797  and dominant military and political leader of the United States from 1775 to 1799  He led the American victory over Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War as commander in chief of the Continental Army from 1775 to 1783  and presided over the writing of the Constitution in 1787  Washington became the first president by unanimous choice  and oversaw the creation of a strong  well financed national government that maintained neutrality in the wars raging in Europe  suppressed rebellion and won acceptance among Americans of all types  His leadership style established many forms and rituals of government that have been used since  such as using a cabinet system and delivering an inaugural address  Washington is universally regarded as the  Father of his country   Washington was born into the provincial gentry of the Colonial Virginia slave society 2   his wealthy planter family owned tobacco plantations and slaves  After both his father and older brother died when he was young  Washington became personally and professionally attached to the powerful William Fairfax  who promoted his career as a surveyor and soldier  Washington quickly became a senior officer in the colonial forces during the first stages of the French and Indian War  Chosen by the Second Continental Congress in 1775 to be commander in chief of the Continental Army in the American Revolution  Washington managed to force the British out of Boston in 1776  but was defeated and almost captured later that year when he lost New York City  After crossing the Delaware River in the dead of winter  he defeated the British in two battles  retook New Jersey and restored momentum to the Patriot cause  Because of his strategy  Revolutionary forces captured two major British armies at Saratoga in 1777 and Yorktown in 1781  Historians laud Washington for his selection and supervision of his generals  encouragement of morale and ability to hold together the army  coordination with the state governors and state militia units  relations with Congress and attention to supplies  logistics  and training  In battle  however  Washington was repeatedly outmaneuvered by British generals with larger armies  After victory had been finalized in 1783  Washington resigned rather than seize power  proving his opposition to dictatorship and his commitment to American republicanism  He retired from the presidency in 1797 and returned to his home  Mount Vernon  and his domestic life where he managed a variety of enterprises  He freed all his slaves by his final 1799 will  Dissatisfied with the weaknesses of Articles of Confederation  in 1787 Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention that drafted the United States Constitution  Elected as the first President of the United States in 1789  he attempted to bring rival factions together to unify the nation  He supported Alexander Hamilton s programs to pay off all state and national debt  to implement an effective tax system and to create a national bank  despite opposition from Thomas Jefferson   Washington proclaimed the U S  neutral in the wars raging in Europe after 1793  He avoided war with Great Britain and guaranteed a decade of peace and profitable trade by securing the Jay Treaty in 1795  despite intense opposition from the Jeffersonians  Although never officially joining the Federalist Party  he supported its programs  Washington s  Farewell Address  was an influential primer on republican virtue and a warning against partisanship  sectionalism  and involvement in foreign wars  Washington had a vision of a great and powerful nation that would be built on republican lines using federal power  He sought to use the national government to preserve liberty  improve infrastructure  open the western lands  promote commerce  found a permanent capital  reduce regional tensions and promote a spirit of American nationalism  3  At his death  Washington was hailed as  first in war  first in peace  and first in the hearts of his countrymen   4  The Federalists made him the symbol of their party but for many years  the Jeffersonians continued to distrust his influence and delayed building the Washington Monument  As the leader of the first successful revolution against a colonial empire in world history  Washington became an international icon for liberation and nationalism  especially in France and Latin America  5  He is consistently ranked among the top three presidents of the United States  according to polls of both scholars and the general public  Contents 1 Early life  1732 1753  2 French and Indian War  or  Seven Years War   1754 1758  2 1 Braddock

Augustine Washington  1694 1743  and his second wife  Mary Ball Washington  1708 1789   George Washington was born on their Pope s Creek Estate near present day Colonial Beach in Westmoreland County  Virginia  According to the Julian calendar and Annunciation Style of enumerating years  then in use in the British Empire  Washington was born on February 11  1731  according to the Gregorian calendar  implemented in the British Empire in 1752  according to the provisions of the Calendar  New Style  Act 1750  the date was February 22  1732  6  7  Note 1  Washington s ancestors were from Sulgrave  England  his great grandfather  John Washington  had immigrated to Virginia in 1657  8  George s father Augustine was a slave owning tobacco planter who later tried his hand in iron mining ventures  9  In George s youth  the Washingtons were moderately prosperous members of the Virginia gentry  of  middling rank  rather than one of the leading planter families  10  At this time  Virginia and other southern colonies had become a slave society  in which slaveholders formed the ruling class and the economy was based on slave labor  11  Six of George s siblings reached maturity  including two older half brothers  Lawrence and Augustine  from his father s first marriage to Jane Butler Washington  and four full siblings  Samuel  Elizabeth  Betty   John Augustine and Charles  Three siblings died before becoming adults  his full sister Mildred died when she was about one  12  his half brother Butler died while an infant  13  and his half sister Jane died at the age of 12  when George was about 2  12  George s father died when George was 11 years old  after which George s half brother Lawrence became a surrogate father and role model  William Fairfax  Lawrence s father in law and cousin of Virginia s largest landowner  Thomas  Lord Fairfax  was also a formative influence  Washington spent much of his boyhood at Ferry Farm in Stafford County near Fredericksburg  Lawrence Washington inherited another family property from his father  a plantation on the Potomac River which he later named Mount Vernon  George inherited Ferry Farm upon his father s death  and eventually acquired Mount Vernon after Lawrence s death  14  The death of his father prevented Washington from crossing the Atlantic to receive the rest of his education at England s Appleby School  as his older brothers had done  He received the equivalent of an elementary school education from a variety of tutors  15  and also a school run by an Anglican clergyman in or near Fredericksburg  16  Talk of securing an appointment in the Royal Navy for him when he was 15 was dropped when his mother learned how hard that would be on him  17  Thanks to Lawrence s connection to the powerful Fairfax family  at age 17 in 1749  Washington was appointed official surveyor for Culpeper County  a well paid position which enabled him to purchase land in the Shenandoah Valley  the first of his many land acquisitions in western Virginia  Thanks also to Lawrence s involvement in the Ohio Company  a land investment company funded by Virginia investors  and Lawrence s position as commander of the Virginia militia  Washington came to the notice of the new lieutenant governor of Virginia  Robert Dinwiddie  Washington was hard to miss  At exactly six feet  he towered over most of his contemporaries  18  In 1751  Washington travelled to Barbados with Lawrence  who was suffering from tuberculosis  with the hope that the climate would be beneficial to Lawrence s health  Washington contracted smallpox during the trip  which left his face slightly scarred  but immunized him against future exposures to the dreaded disease  19  Lawrence s health did not improve  he returned to Mount Vernon  where he died in 1752  20  Lawrence s position as Adjutant General  militia leader  of Virginia was divided into four offices after his death  Washington was appointed by Governor Dinwiddie as one of the four district adjutants in February 1753  with the rank of major in the Virginia militia  21  Washington also joined the Freemasons fraternal association in Fredericksburg at this time  22  French and Indian War  or  Seven Years War   1754 1758  Main article  George Washington in the French and Indian War See also  Military career of George Washington  Battle of Jumonville Glen  Battle of Fort Necessity  and Forbes Expedition Washington s map  accompanying his Journal to the Ohio  1753 1754  In 1753  the French began expanding their military control into the  Ohio Country   a territory also claimed by the British colonies of Virginia and Pennsylvania  These competing claims led to a war in the colonies called the French and Indian War  1754 62   and contributed to the start of the global Seven Years  War  1756 63   Washington was at the center of its beginning  The Ohio Company was one vehicle through which British investors planned to expand into the territory  opening new settlements and building trading posts for the Indian trade  Governor Dinwiddie received orders from the British government to warn the French of British claims  and sent Major Washington in late 1753 to deliver a letter informing the French of those claims and asking them to leave  23  Washington also met with Tanacharison  also called  Half King   and other Iroquois leaders allied to Virginia at Logstown to secure their support in case of conflict with the French  Washington and Tanacharison became friends and allies  Washington delivered the letter to the local French commander  who politely refused to leave  24  Governor Dinwiddie sent Washington back to the Ohio Country to protect an Ohio Company group building a fort at present day Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania but before he reached the area  a French force drove out the company s crew and began construction of Fort Duquesne  A small detachment of French troops led by Joseph Coulon de Jumonville  was discovered by Tanacharison and a few warriors east of present day Uniontown  Pennsylvania  Along with their Mingo allies  Washington and some of his militia unit then ambushed the French  What exactly happened during and after the battle is a matter of some controversy  but the immediate outcome was that Jumonville was injured in the initial attack and then was killed   whether tomahawked by Tanacharison in cold blood or somehow shot by another onlooker with a musket as the injured man sat with Washington is not completely clear  25  26  The French responded by attacking and capturing Washington at Fort Necessity in July 1754  27  However  he was allowed to return with his troops to Virginia  Historian Joseph Ellis concludes that the episode demonstrated Washington s bravery  initiative  inexperience and impetuosity  28  These events had international consequences  the French accused Washington of assassinating Jumonville  who they claimed was on a diplomatic mission  28  Both France and Great Britain were ready to fight for control of the region and both sent troops to North America in 1755  war was formally declared in 1756  29  Braddock disaster 1755 Main article  Braddock Expedition In 1755  Washington was the senior American aide to British General Edward Braddock on the ill fated Braddock expedition  This was the largest British expedition to the colonies  and was intended to expel the French from the Ohio Country  The French and their Indian allies ambushed Braddock  who was mortally wounded in the Battle of the Monongahela  After suffering devastating casualties  the British retreated in disarray  however  Washington rode back and forth across the battlefield  rallying the remnants of the British and Virginian forces to an organized retreat  30  Commander of Virginia Regiment Governor Dinwiddie rewarded Washington in 1755 with a commission as  Colonel of the Virginia Regiment and Commander in Chief of all forces now raised in the defense of His Majesty s Colony  and gave him the task of defending Virginia s frontier  The Virginia Regiment was the first full time American military unit in the colonies  as opposed to part time militias and the British regular units   Washington was ordered to  act defensively or offensively  as he thought best  31  In command of a thousand soldiers  Washington was a disciplinarian who emphasized training  He led his men in brutal campaigns against the Indians in the west  in 10 months units of his regiment fought 20 battles  and lost a third of its men  Washington s strenuous efforts meant that Virginia s frontier population suffered less than that of other colonies  Ellis concludes  it was his only unqualified success  in the war  32  33  In 1758  Washington participated in the Forbes Expedition to capture Fort Duquesne  He was embarrassed by a friendly fire episode in which his unit and another British unit thought the other was the French enemy and opened fire  with 14 dead and 26 wounded in the mishap  Washington was not involved in any other major fighting on the expedition  and the British scored a major strategic victory  gaining control of the Ohio Valley  when the French abandoned the fort  Following the expedition  Washington retired from his Virginia Regiment commission in December 1758  He did not return to military life until the outbreak of the revolution in 1775  34  Lessons learned Although Washington never gained the commission in the British army he yearned for  in these years the young man gained valuable military  political  and leadership skills  35  36  He closely observed British military tactics  gaining a keen insight into their strengths and weaknesses that proved invaluable during the Revolution  He demonstrated his toughness and courage in the most difficult situations  including disasters and retreats  He developed a command presence given his size  strength  stamina  and bravery in battle  he appeared to soldiers to be a natural leader and they followed him without question  37  38  Washington learned to organize  train  drill  and discipline his companies and regiments  From his observations  readings and conversations with professional officers  he learned the basics of battlefield tactics  as well as a good understanding of problems of organization and logistics  39  He gained an understanding of overall strategy  especially in locating strategic geographical points  40  Historian Ron Chernow is of the opinion that his frustrations in dealing with government officials during this conflict led him to advocate the advantages of a strong national government and a vigorous executive agency that could get results  35  other historians tend to ascribe Washington s position on government to his later American Revolutionary War service  Note 2  He developed a very negative idea of the value of militia  who seemed too unreliable  too undisciplined  and too short term compared to regulars  41  On the other hand  his experience was limited to command of at most 1000 men  and came only in remote frontier conditions that were far removed from the urban situations he faced during the Revolution at Boston  New York  Trenton and Philadelphia  42  Between the wars  Mount Vernon  1759 1774  A mezzotint of Martha Washington  based on a 1757 portrait by Wollaston On January 6  1759  Washington married the wealthy widow Martha Dandridge Custis  then 28 years old  Surviving letters suggest that he may have been in love at the time with Sally Fairfax  the wife of a friend  43  Nevertheless  George and Martha made a compatible marriage  because Martha was intelligent  gracious  and experienced in managing a planter s estate  44  Together the two raised her two children from her previous marriage  John Parke Custis and Martha Parke Custis  affectionately called  Jackie  and  Patsy  by the family  Later the Washingtons raised two of Mrs  Washington s grandchildren  Eleanor Parke Custis and George Washington Parke Custis  George and Martha never had any children together   his earlier bout with smallpox in 1751 may have made him sterile  45  Washington may not have been able to admit to his own sterility while privately he grieved over not having his own children  46  47  The newlywed couple moved to Mount Vernon  near Alexandria  where he took up the life of a planter and political figure  Washington s marriage to Martha greatly increased his property holdings and social standing  and made him one of Virginia s wealthiest men  He acquired one third of the 18 000 acre  73 km2  Custis estate upon his marriage  worth approximately  100 000  and managed the remainder on behalf of Martha s children  for whom he sincerely cared  48  In 1754  Lieutenant Governor Dinwiddie had promised land bounties to the soldiers and officers who volunteered to serve during the French and Indian War  49  Governor Norborne Berkeley finally fulfilled Dinwiddie s promise in 1769 1770  49  50  with Washington subsequently receiving title to 23 200 acres  94 km2  near where the Kanawha River flows into the Ohio River  in what is now western West Virginia  51  He also frequently bought additional land in his own name  By 1775  Washington had doubled the size of Mount Vernon to 6 500 acres  26 km2   and had increased its slave population to over 100  As a respected military hero and large landowner  he held local office and was elected to the Virginia provincial legislature  the House of Burgesses  beginning in 1758  52  Washington lived an aristocratic lifestyle fox hunting was a favorite leisure activity  53  He also enjoyed going to dances and parties  in addition to the theater  races  and cockfights  Washington also was known to play cards  backgammon  and billiards  54  Like most Virginia planters  he imported luxuries and other goods from England and paid for them by exporting his tobacco crop  55  Washington enlarged the house at Mount Vernon after his marriage Washington began to pull himself out of debt in the mid 1760s by diversifying his previously tobacco centric business interests into other ventures 55  and paying more attention to his affairs  56  In 1766  he started switching Mount Vernon s primary cash crop away from tobacco to wheat  a crop that could be processed and then sold in various forms in the colonies  and further diversified operations to include flour milling  fishing  horse breeding  spinning  weaving and  in the 1790s  whiskey production  55  Patsy Custis s death in 1773 from epilepsy enabled Washington to pay off his British creditors  since half of her inheritance passed to him  57  A successful planter  he was a leader in the social elite in Virginia  From 1768 to 1775  he invited some 2000 guests to his Mount Vernon estate  mostly those he considered  people of rank   As for people not of high social status  his advice was to  treat them civilly  but  keep them at a proper distance  for they will grow upon familiarity  in proportion as you sink in authority   58  In 1769  he became more politically active  presenting the Virginia Assembly with legislation to ban the importation of goods from Great Britain  59  American Revolution  1775 1787  Main article  George Washington in the American Revolution See also  Military career of George Washington Although he expressed opposition to the 1765 Stamp Act  the first direct tax on the colonies  he did not take a leading role in the growing colonial resistance until protests of the Townshend Acts  enacted in 1767  became widespread  In May 1769  Washington introduced a proposal  drafted by his friend George Mason  calling for Virginia to boycott English goods until the Acts were repealed  60  Parliament repealed the Townshend Acts in 1770  However  Washington regarded the passage of the Intolerable Acts in 1774 as  an Invasion of our Rights and Privileges   61  In July 1774  he chaired the meeting at which the  Fairfax Resolves  were adopted  which called for the convening of a Continental Congress  among other things  In August  Washington attended the First Virginia Convention  where he was selected as a delegate to the First Continental Congress  62  Commander in chief After the Battles of Lexington and Concord near Boston in April 1775  the colonies went to war  Washington appeared at the Second Continental Congress in a military uniform  signaling that he was prepared for war  63  Washington had the prestige  military experience  charisma and military bearing of a military leader and was known as a strong patriot  Virginia  the largest colony  deserved recognition  and New England where the fighting began realized it needed Southern support  Washington did not explicitly seek the office of commander and said that he was not equal to it  but there was no serious competition  64  Congress created the Continental Army on June 14  1775  Nominated by John Adams of Massachusetts  Washington was then appointed Major General and Commander in chief  65  Washington had three roles during the war  In 1775 77  and again in 1781 he led his men against the main British forces  Although he lost many of his battles  he never surrendered his army during the war  and he continued to fight the British relentlessly until the war s end  He plotted the overall strategy of the war  in cooperation with Congress  66  Second  he was charged with organizing and training the army  He recruited regulars and assigned Baron and General Friedrich von Steuben  a veteran of the Prussian general staff  to train them  The war effort and getting supplies to the troops were under the purview of Congress  67  but Washington pressured the Congress to provide the essentials  68  In June 1776  Congress  first attempt at running the war effort was established with the committee known as  Board of War and Ordnance   succeeded by the Board of War in July 1777  a committee which eventually included members of the military  67  The command structure of the Americans  armed forces was a hodgepodge of Congressional appointees  and Congress sometimes made those appointments without Washington s input  with state appointments filling the lower ranks and of all of the militia officers  69  The results of his general staff were mixed  as some of his favorites  like John Sullivan  never mastered the art of command  Eventually he found capable officers  like General Nathaniel Greene  and his chief of staff Alexander Hamilton  The American officers never equalled their opponents in tactics and maneuver  and consequently they lost most of the pitched battles  The great successes  at Boston  1776   Saratoga  1777  and Yorktown  1781   came from trapping the British far from base with much larger numbers of troops  66  Third  and most important  Washington was the embodiment of armed resistance to the Crown the representative man of the Revolution  His enormous stature and political skills kept Congress  the army  the French  the militias  and the states all pointed toward a common goal  By voluntarily stepping down and disbanding his army when the war was won  he permanently established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs  And yet his constant reiteration of the point that well disciplined professional soldiers counted for twice as much as erratic amateurs helped overcome the ideological distrust of a standing army  70  Victory at Boston Washington assumed command of the Continental Army in the field at Cambridge  Massachusetts  in July 1775  during the ongoing siege of Boston  Realizing his army s desperate shortage of gunpowder  Washington asked for new sources  American troops raided British arsenals  including some in the Caribbean  and some manufacturing was attempted  They obtained a barely adequate supply  about 2 5 million pounds  by the end of 1776  mostly from France  71  Washington reorganized the army during the long standoff  and forced the British to withdraw by putting artillery on Dorchester Heights overlooking the city  The British evacuated Boston in March 1776 and Washington moved his army to New York City  72  Although highly disparaging toward most of the Patriots  British newspapers routinely praised Washington s personal character and qualities as a military commander  These articles were bold  as Washington was an enemy general who commanded an army in a cause that many Britons believed would ruin the empire  73  Defeat at New York City and Fabian tactics General George Washington at Trenton by John Trumbull  Yale University Art Gallery  1792  In August 1776  British General William Howe launched a massive naval and land campaign designed to seize New York  The Continental Army under Washington engaged the enemy for the first time as an army of the newly independent United States at the Battle of Long Island  the largest battle of the entire war  The Americans were heavily outnumbered  many men deserted  and Washington was badly beaten  Subsequently  Washington was forced to retreat across the East River at night  He did so without loss of life or materiel  74  Washington retreated north from the city to avoid encirclement  enabling Howe to take the offensive and capture Fort Washington on November 16 with high Continental casualties  Washington then retreated across New Jersey  the future of the Continental Army was in doubt due to expiring enlistments and the string of losses  75  On the night of December 25  1776  Washington staged a comeback with a surprise attack on a Hessian outpost in western New Jersey  He led his army across the Delaware River to capture nearly 1 000 Hessians in Trenton  New Jersey  Washington followed up his victory at Trenton with another over British regulars at Princeton in early January  The British retreated back to New York City and its environs  which they held until the peace treaty of 1783  Washington s victories wrecked the British carrot and stick strategy of showing overwhelming force then offering generous terms  The Americans would not negotiate for anything short of independence  76  These victories alone were not enough to ensure ultimate Patriot victory  however  since many soldiers did not reenlist or deserted during the harsh winter  Washington and Congress reorganized the army with increased rewards for staying and punishment for desertion  which raised troop numbers effectively for subsequent battles  77  Historians debate whether or not Washington preferred a Fabian strategy Note 3  to harass the British with quick  sharp attacks followed by a retreat so the larger British army could not catch him  or whether he preferred to fight major battles  Note 4  While his southern commander Greene in 1780 81 did use Fabian tactics  Washington did so only in fall 1776 to spring 1777  after losing New York City and seeing much of his army melt away  Trenton and Princeton were Fabian examples  By summer 1777  however  Washington had rebuilt his strength and his confidence  he stopped using raids and went for large scale confrontations  as at Brandywine  Germantown  Monmouth and Yorktown  78  1777 campaigns In the late summer of 1777  the British under John Burgoyne sent a major invasion army south from Quebec  with the intention of splitting off rebellious New England  General Howe in New York took his army south to Philadelphia instead of going up the Hudson River to join with Burgoyne near Albany  It was a major strategic mistake for the British  and Washington rushed to Philadelphia to engage Howe  while closely following the action in upstate New York  In pitched battles that were too complex for his relatively inexperienced men  Washington was defeated  At the Battle of Brandywine on September 11  1777  Howe outmaneuvered Washington  and marched into the American capital at Philadelphia unopposed on September 26  Washington s army unsuccessfully attacked the British garrison at Germantown in early October  Meanwhile  Burgoyne  out of reach from help from Howe  was trapped and forced to surrender his entire army at Saratoga  New York  79  It was a major turning point militarily and diplomatically  France responded to Burgoyne s defeat by entering the war  openly allying with America and turning the Revolutionary War into a major worldwide war  Washington s loss of Philadelphia prompted some members of Congress to discuss removing Washington from command  This attempt failed after Washington s supporters rallied behind him  80  Valley Forge Main article  Valley Forge Washington and Lafayette look over the troops at Valley Forge Washington s army of 11 000 81  went into winter quarters at Valley Forge north of Philadelphia in December 1777  Over the next six months  the deaths in camp numbered in the thousands  the majority being from disease   82  with historians  death toll estimates ranging from 2000 82  to 2500  83  84  to over 3000 men  85  The next spring  however  the army emerged from Valley Forge in good order  thanks in part to a full scale training program supervised by General von Steuben  86  The British evacuated Philadelphia to New York in 1778  87  shadowed by Washington  Washington attacked them at Monmouth  fighting to an effective draw in one of the war s largest battles  88  Afterwards  the British continued to head towards New York  and Washington moved his army outside of New York  87  Victory at Yorktown The Surrender of Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown October 19  1781 by John Trumbull  Yale University Art Gallery  1787  ca  1828  General George Washington Resigning His Commission by John Trumbull  Capitol Rotunda  commissioned 1817  In the summer of 1779 at Washington s direction  General John Sullivan carried out a scorched earth campaign that destroyed at least 40 Iroquois villages in central and upstate New York  the Indians were British allies who had been raiding American settlements on the frontier  89  In July 1780  5 000 veteran French troops led by General Comte Donatien de Rochambeau arrived at Newport  Rhode Island to aid in the war effort  90  The Continental Army having been funded by  20 000 in French gold  Washington delivered the final blow to the British in 1781  after a French naval victory allowed American and French forces to trap a British army in Virginia  The surrender at Yorktown on October 17  1781  marked the end of major fighting in continental North America  91  Demobilization Washington could not know that after Yorktown  the British would not reopen hostilities  They still had 26 000 troops occupying New York City  Charleston and Savannah  together with a powerful fleet  The French army and navy departed  so the Americans were on their own in 1782 83  The treasury was empty  and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive  almost to the point of mutiny or possible coup d  tat  Washington dispelled unrest among officers by suppressing the Newburgh Conspiracy in March 1783  and Congress came up with the promise of a five year bonus  92  By the Treaty of Paris  signed that September   Great Britain recognized the independence of the United States  Washington disbanded his army and  on November 2  gave an eloquent farewell address to his soldiers  93  On November 25  the British evacuated New York City  and Washington and the governor took possession  At Fraunces Tavern on December 4  Washington formally bade his officers farewell and on December 23  1783  he resigned his commission as commander in chief  Historian Gordon Wood concludes that the greatest act in his life was his resignation as commander of the armies an act that stunned aristocratic Europe  94 King George III called Washington  the greatest character of the age  because of this  95  Constitutional Convention  1787  Washington s retirement to Mount Vernon was short lived  He made an exploratory trip to the western frontier in 1784  65  was persuaded to attend the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787  and was unanimously elected president of the Convention  He participated little in the debates  though he did vote for or against the various articles   but his high prestige maintained collegiality and kept the delegates at their labors  The delegates designed the presidency with Washington in mind  and allowed him to define the office once elected  96  After the Convention  his support convinced many to vote for ratification  the new Constitution was ratified by all thirteen states  97  Presidency  1789 1797  George Washington by Rembrandt Peale  De Young Museum  ca  1850  Main article  Presidency of George Washington The Electoral College elected Washington unanimously as the first president in 1789  Note 5  and again in the 1792 election  he remains the only president to have received 100 percent of the electoral votes  Note 6 John Adams  who received the next highest vote total  was elected Vice President  At his inauguration  Washington took the oath of office as the first President of the United States of America on April 30  1789  on the balcony of Federal Hall in New York City  99  The 1st United States Congress voted to pay Washington a salary of  25 000 a year a large sum in 1789  Washington  already wealthy  declined the salary  since he valued his image as a selfless public servant  At the urging of Congress  however  he ultimately accepted the payment  to avoid setting a precedent whereby the presidency would be perceived as limited only to independently wealthy individuals who could serve without any salary  100  The president  aware that everything he did set a precedent  attended carefully to the pomp and ceremony of office  making sure that the titles and trappings were suitably republican and never emulated European royal courts  To that end  he preferred the title  Mr  President  to the more majestic names suggested  101  Washington proved an able administrator  An excellent delegator and judge of talent and character  he talked regularly with department heads and listened to their advice before making a final decision  102  In handling routine tasks  he was  systematic  orderly  energetic  solicitous of the opinion of others     but decisive  intent upon general goals and the consistency of particular actions with them   103  Washington reluctantly served a second term  He refused to run for a third  establishing the customary policy of a maximum of two terms for a president  104  Domestic issues See also  Whiskey Rebellion Washington was not a member of any political party and hoped that they would not be formed  fearing conflict that would undermine republicanism  105  His closest advisors formed two factions  setting the framework for the future First Party System  Secretary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton had bold plans to establish the national credit and build a financially powerful nation  and formed the basis of the Federalist Party  Secretary of the State Thomas Jefferson  founder of the Jeffersonian Republicans  strenuously opposed Hamilton s agenda  but Washington typically favored Hamilton over Jefferson  and it was Hamilton s agenda that went into effect  Jefferson s political actions  his support of Philip Freneau s National Gazette  106  and his attempt to undermine Hamilton  nearly led George Washington to dismiss Jefferson from his cabinet  107  Though Jefferson left the cabinet voluntarily  Washington never forgave him  and never spoke to him again  107  The Residence Act of 1790  which Washington signed  authorized the President to select the specific location of the permanent seat of the government  which would be located along the Potomac River  The Act authorized the President to appoint three commissioners to survey and acquire property for this seat  Washington personally oversaw this effort throughout his term in office  In 1791  the commissioners named the permanent seat of government  The City of Washington in the Territory of Columbia  to honor Washington  In 1800  the Territory of Columbia became the District of Columbia when the federal government moved to the site according to the provisions of the Residence Act  108  In 1791  Congress imposed an excise tax on distilled spirits  which led to protests in frontier districts  especially Pennsylvania  By 1794  after Washington ordered the protesters to appear in U S  district court  the protests turned into full scale defiance of federal authority known as the Whiskey Rebellion  The federal army was too small to be used  so Washington invoked the Militia Act of 1792 to summon militias from Pennsylvania  Virginia  Maryland and New Jersey  109  The governors sent the troops and Washington took command  marching into the rebellious districts  The rebels dispersed and there was no fighting  as Washington s forceful action proved the new government could protect itself  These events marked the first time under the new constitution that the federal government used strong military force to exert authority over the states and citizens  110  Foreign affairs In February 1793 a major war broke out between conservative Great Britain and its allies and revolutionary France  launching an era of large scale warfare that engulfed Europe until 1815  Washington  with cabinet approval  proclaimed American neutrality  The revolutionary government of France sent diplomat Edmond Charles Gen t  called  Citizen Gen t   to America  Gen t was welcomed with great enthusiasm and propagandized the case for France in the French war against Great Britain  and for this purpose promoted a network of new Democratic Societies in major cities  He issued French letters of marque and reprisal to French ships manned by American sailors so they could capture British merchant ships  Washington  warning and mistrustful of the influence of Illuminism that had been so strong in the French Revolution  as recounted by John Robison and Abb  Augustin Barruel  and its Reign of Terror  demanded the French government recall Gen t  and denounced the societies  111  Hamilton and Washington designed the Jay Treaty to normalize trade relations with Great Britain  remove them from western forts  and resolve financial debts left over from the Revolution  112 John Jay negotiated and signed the treaty on November 19  1794  The Jeffersonians supported France and strongly attacked the treaty  Washington s strong support mobilized public opinion and proved decisive in securing ratification in the Senate by the necessary two thirds majority  113  The British agreed to depart from their forts around the Great Lakes  subsequently the U S  Canadian boundary had to be re adjusted  numerous pre Revolutionary debts were liquidated  and the British opened their West Indies colonies to American trade  Most importantly  the treaty delayed war with Great Britain and instead brought a decade of prosperous trade with Great Britain  The treaty angered the French and became a central issue in many political debates  114  Relations with France deteriorated after the treaty was signed  leaving his successor  John Adams  with the prospect of war  115  116  Farewell Address Main article  George Washington s Farewell Address Washington s Farewell Address  September 19  1796  Washington s Farewell Address  issued as a public letter in 1796  was one of the most influential statements of republicanism  Drafted primarily by Washington himself  with help from Hamilton  it gives advice on the necessity and importance of national union  the value of the Constitution and the rule of law  the evils of political parties  and the proper virtues of a republican people  He called morality  a necessary spring of popular government   He said   Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure  reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle   117  Washington s public political address warned against foreign influence in domestic affairs and American meddling in European affairs  He warned against bitter partisanship in domestic politics and called for men to move beyond partisanship and serve the common good  He warned against  permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world   118  saying the United States must concentrate primarily on American interests  He counseled friendship and commerce with all nations  but warned against involvement in European wars and entering into long term  entangling  alliances  The address quickly set American values regarding foreign affairs  119  Retirement  1797 1799  After retiring from the presidency in March 1797  Washington returned to Mount Vernon with a profound sense of relief  He devoted much time to his plantations and other business interests  including his distillery which produced its first batch of spirits in February 1797  120  As Chernow  2010  explains  his plantation operations were at best marginally profitable  The lands out west yielded little income because they were under attack by Indians and the squatters living there refused to pay him rent  Most Americans assumed he was rich because of the well known  glorified fa ade of wealth and grandeur  at Mount Vernon  121  Historians estimate his estate was worth about  1 million in 1799 dollars  equivalent to about  18 million in 2009 purchasing power  122  By 1798  relations with France had deteriorated to the point that war seemed imminent  and on July 4  1798  President Adams offered Washington a commission as lieutenant general and Commander in chief of the armies raised or to be raised for service in a prospective war  He reluctantly accepted  and served as the senior officer of the United States Army between July 13  1798  and December 14  1799  He participated in the planning for a Provisional Army to meet any emergency that might arise  but avoided involvement in details as much as possible  he delegated most of the work  including leadership of the army  to Hamilton  123  124  Death Washington s tomb at Mount Vernon  Virginia On December 12  1799  Washington spent several hours inspecting his plantation on horseback  in snow  hail and freezing rain later that evening eating his supper without changing from his wet clothes  Friday morning  he awoke with a severe sore throat  either quinsy or acute epiglottitis  and became increasingly hoarse as the day progressed  Sometime around 3 a m  that Saturday morning  he awoke his wife and said he felt ill  Following common medical practice at the time  he was bled initially by an employee and later again by physicians   A vein was opened  but no relief afforded  Couriers were dispatched to Dr  Craik  the family  and Drs  Dick and Brown  the consulting physicians  all of whom came with speed  The proper remedies were administered  but without producing their healing effects  while the patient  yielding to the anxious looks of all around him  waived his usual objections to medicines  and took those which were prescribed without hesitation or remark   125  Washington died at home around 10  p m  on Saturday  December 14  1799  aged 67  The last words in his diary were   Tis well   Note 7  Throughout the world  men and women were saddened by Washington s death  Napoleon ordered 10 days of mourning throughout France  in the United States  thousands wore mourning clothes for months  126  To protect their privacy  Martha Washington burned the correspondence between her husband and her following his death  Only a total of five letters between the couple are known to have survived  two letters from Martha to George and three from him to Martha  127  128  On December 18  1799  a funeral was held at Mount Vernon  where his body was interred  129  Congress passed a joint resolution to construct a marble monument in the United States Capitol for his body  supported by Martha  In December 1800  the United States House passed an appropriations bill for  200 000 to build the mausoleum  which was to be a pyramid that had a base 100 feet  30 m  square  Southern opposition to the plan defeated the measure because they felt it was best to have his body remain at Mount Vernon  130  In 1831  for the centennial of his birth  a new tomb was constructed to receive his remains  That year  an unsuccessful attempt was made to steal the body of Washington  131  Despite this  a joint Congressional committee in early 1832 debated the removal of Washington s body from Mount Vernon to a crypt in the Capitol  built by Charles Bulfinch in the 1820s  Southern opposition was intense  antagonized by an ever growing rift between North and South  Congressman Wiley Thompson of Georgia expressed the fear of Southerners when he said  Remove the remains of our venerated Washington from their association with the remains of his consort and his ancestors  from Mount Vernon and from his native State  and deposit them in this capitol  and then let a severance of the Union occur  and behold the remains of Washington on a shore foreign to his native soil  130  His remains were moved on October 7  1837 to the new tomb constructed at Mount Vernon  presented by John Struthers of Philadelphia  132  After the ceremony  the inner vault s door was closed and the key was thrown into the Potomac  133  Legacy Main article  George Washington s legacy See also  Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States and Cultural depictions of George Washington Congressman Henry  Light Horse Harry  Lee  a Revolutionary War comrade  famously eulogized Washington  134   First in war first in peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen  he was second to none in the humble and enduring scenes of private life  pious  just  humane  temperate  and sincere  uniform  dignified  and commanding  his example was as edifying to all around him as were the effects of that example lasting  To his equals he was condescending  to his inferiors kind  and to the dear object of his affections exemplarily tender  correct throughout  vice shuddered in his presence  and virtue always felt his fostering hand  the purity of his private character gave effulgence to his public virtues  His last scene comported with the whole tenor of his life although in extreme pain  not a sigh  not a groan escaped him  and with undisturbed serenity he closed his well spent life  Such was the man America has lost such was the man for whom our nation mourns   Lee s words set the standard by which Washington s overwhelming reputation was impressed upon the American memory  Washington set many precedents for the national government  and the presidency in particular  and was called the  Father of His Country  as early as 1778  Note 8  135  136  137 Washington s Birthday  celebrated on Presidents  Day   is a federal holiday in the United States  138  During the United States Bicentennial year  George Washington was posthumously appointed to the grade of General of the Armies of the United States by the congressional joint resolution Public Law 94 479 passed on January 19  1976  with an effective appointment date of July 4  1976  65  This restored Washington s position as the highest ranking military officer in U S  history  Note 9  George Washington  the Lansdowne portrait  by Gilbert Stuart Cherry tree See also  Parson Weems The cherry tree anecdote Apocryphal stories about Washington s childhood include a claim that he skipped a silver dollar across the Potomac River at Mount Vernon  and that he chopped down his father s cherry tree and admitted the deed when questioned   I can t tell a lie  Pa   The anecdote was first reported by biographer Parson Weems  who after Washington s death interviewed people who knew him as a child  The Weems version was very widely reprinted throughout the 19th century  for example in McGuffey Readers  Moralistic adults wanted children to learn moral lessons from the past from history  especially as taught by great national heroes like Washington  After 1890 however  historians insisted on scientific research methods to validate every story  and there was no evidence for this anecdote apart from Weems  report  Joseph Rodman in 1904 noted that Weems plagiarized other Washington tales from published fiction set in England  No one has found an alternative source for the cherry tree story  thus Weems  credibility is questioned  139  140  Monuments and memorials The George Washington Masonic National Memorial  Alexandria  Virginia Starting with victory in their Revolution  there were many proposals to build a monument to Washington  After his death  Congress authorized a suitable memorial in the national capital  but the decision was reversed when the Republicans took control of Congress in 1801  The Republicans were dismayed that Washington had become the symbol of the Federalist Party  furthermore  the values of Republicanism seemed hostile to the idea of building monuments to powerful men  141  Further political squabbling  along with the North South division on the Civil War  blocked the completion of the Washington Monument until the late 19th century  By that time  Washington had the image of a national hero who could be celebrated by both North and South  and memorials to him were no longer controversial  142  Predating the obelisk on the National Mall by several decades  the first public memorial to Washington was built by the citizens of Boonsboro  Maryland  in 1827  143  Today  Washington s face and image are often used as national symbols of the United States  144  He appears on contemporary currency  including the one dollar bill and the quarter coin  and on U S  postage stamps  Along with appearing on the first postage stamps issued by the U S  Post Office in 1847  145  Washington  together with Theodore Roosevelt  Thomas Jefferson  and Lincoln  is depicted in stone at the Mount Rushmore Memorial  The Washington Monument  one of the best known American landmarks  was built in his honor  The George Washington Masonic National Memorial in Alexandria  Virginia  was constructed between 1922 and 1932 with voluntary contributions from all 52 local governing bodies of the Freemasons in the United States  146  147  Lieutenant General George Washington by Clark Mills  Washington Circle  Washington  D C   1860  Many places and entities have been named in honor of Washington  Washington s name became that of

state to be named after a United States President  148 George Washington University and Washington University in St  Louis were named for him  as was Washington and Lee University  once Washington Academy   which was renamed due to Washington s large endowment in 1796  Washington College in Chestertown  Maryland  established by Maryland state charter in 1782  was supported by Washington during his lifetime with a 50 guineas pledge  149  and with service on the college s Board of Visitors and Governors until 1789  when Washington was elected President   150  According to the 1993 US Census  Washington is the 17th most common street name in the United States  151  and the only person s name so honored  Note 10  The Confederate Seal prominently featured George Washington on horseback  152

Trafalgar Square  154  In 1917  the 886 Washingtonia asteroid was named in his honor  Papers Main article  The Papers of George Washington The serious collection and publication of Washington s documentary record began with the pioneer work of Jared Sparks in the 1830s  Life and Writings of George Washington  12 vols   1834 1837   The Writings of George Washington from the Original Manuscript Sources  1745 1799  1931 44  is a 37 volume set edited by John C  Fitzpatrick  It contains over 17 000 letters and documents and is available online from the University of Virginia  155  The definitive letterpress edition of his writings was begun by the University of Virginia in 1968  and today comprises 52 published volumes  with more to come  It contains everything written by Washington  or signed by him  together with most of his incoming letters  Part of the collection is available online from the University of Virginia  156  Personal life George Washington  The Constable Hamilton Portrait  by Gilbert Stuart  Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art  Bentonville  Arkansas  1797  Along with Martha s biological family  George Washington had a close relationship with his nephew and heir  Bushrod Washington  son of George s younger brother  John Augustine Washington  After his uncle s death  Bushrod became an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States  George  however  apparently did not get along well with his mother  Mary Ball Washington  Augustine s second wife   who was a very demanding and difficult person  157  As a young man  Washington had red hair  158  A popular myth is that he wore a wig  as was the fashion among some at the time  However  Washington did not wear a wig  instead  he powdered his hair  159  160  as is represented in several portraits  including the well known  unfinished Gilbert Stuart depiction  The Athenaeum portrait  161  Washington had unusually great physical strength that amazed younger men  While the story of him throwing a silver dollar across the Potomac River is untrue  he did throw a rock to the top of the 215 feet tall Natural Bridge citation needed   Jefferson called Washington  the best horseman of his age   and both American and European observers praised his riding  the horsemanship benefited his hunting  a favorite hobby  Washington was an excellent dancer and frequently attended the theater  often referencing Shakespeare in letters  162  He drank in moderation and precisely recorded gambling wins and losses  but Washington disliked the excessive drinking  gambling  smoking  and profanity that was common in colonial Virginia  Although he grew tobacco  he eventually stopped smoking  and considered drunkenness a man s worst vice  Washington was glad that post Revolutionary Virginia society was less likely to  force  guests  to drink and to make it an honor to send them home drunk   163  Washington suffered from problems with his teeth throughout his life  He lost his first adult tooth when he was twenty two and had only one left by the time he became President  164 John Adams claims he lost them because he used them to crack Brazil nuts but modern historians suggest the mercury oxide  which he was given to treat illnesses such as smallpox and malaria  probably contributed to the loss  He had several sets of false teeth made  four of them by a dentist named John Greenwood  164  Contrary to popular belief  none of the sets were made from wood  The set made when he became President was carved from hippopotamus and elephant ivory  held together with gold springs  165  The hippo ivory was used for the plate  into which human teeth  quite possibly from slaves  166  and bits of horses  and donkeys  teeth were inserted  Dental problems left Washington in constant pain  for which he took laudanum  167  This distress may be apparent in many of the portraits painted while he was still in office  167  including the one still used on the  1 bill  161  Note 11  Slavery Main article  George Washington and slavery Regarding slavery  Washington came to oppose it on moral and economic grounds  He is known for being the only Founding Father to free all his slaves at his death  in his 1799 will  168  Washington s will provided for training the younger slaves in useful skills  and created a fund for old age pensions for the older ones  The action was to take effect upon the death of his widow  but Martha chose to free his slaves about 12 months after his death  169  Washington had owned slaves since the death of his father in 1743  when at the age of eleven  he inherited 10 slaves  At the time of his marriage to Martha Custis in 1759  he personally owned at least 36 slaves  which meant he had achieved the status of a major planter  historians defined this in the Upper South as owning 20 or more slaves   The wealthy widow Martha brought at least 85  dower slaves  to Mount Vernon by inheriting a third of her late husband s estate  Using his wife s great wealth  Washington bought more land  tripling the size of the plantation at Mount Vernon  and purchased the additional slaves needed to work it  By 1774  he paid taxes on 135 slaves  this figure does not include the  dowers    The last record of a slave purchase by him was in 1772  although he later received some slaves in repayment of debts  170  Washington also used some hired staff 120  and white indentured servants  in April 1775  he offered a reward for the return of two runaway white servants  171  The historian Ferling claims that Washington wanted the material benefits from owning slaves and also wanted to give his wife s family a large inheritance  172  Before the American Revolution  Washington expressed no moral reservations about slavery  But in 1786  he wrote to Robert Morris  saying   There is not a man living who wishes more sincerely than I do  to see a plan adopted for the abolition of slavery   173  In 1779  he told his manager at Mount Vernon that he wished to sell his slaves when the war ended  if the Americans were victorious  174  Maintaining a large  and increasingly elderly  slave population at Mount Vernon was no longer economically profitable  Washington could not legally sell the  dower slaves   and because they had long intermarried with his own slaves  he could not sell his slaves without breaking up families  which he wanted to avoid  175  As president  Washington brought seven slaves to New York City in 1789 to work in the first presidential household  Following the transfer of the national capital to Philadelphia in 1790  he brought nine slaves to work in the President s House  Two escaped to freedom  176  Washington managed his household in the free state to avoid its rules of residency that would have freed his slaves after six months  residency  he rotated staff to avoid that deadline  Gradually he replaced the slaves with German immigrants who were indentured servants  Washington opposed slavery on both moral and economic grounds  As the historian Gordon S  Wood writes in his review of Joseph Ellis  biography of Washington   He concluded that slavery was economically inefficient and that people who were compelled to work would never work hard     H e preferred  rock ribbed realism  to  any idealistic agenda that floated above the realities of power on the ground   But in his will he did free the slaves whom he owned outright    He did this in the teeth of opposition from his relatives  his neighbors  and perhaps even Martha  It was a courageous act  and one of his greatest legacies   177  At the time of Washington s death  317 slaves lived at Mount Vernon  123 were owned by him  154 were held by his wife as  dower slaves   and 40 were rented from a neighbor  178  Dorothy Twohig argues that Washington did not speak out publicly against slavery because he wanted to avoid a split in the new republic over an issue that was sensitive and divisive  179  By 1794  as he contemplated retirement  Washington began organizing his affairs so that he could free in his will all the slaves whom he owned outright  180  His will provided they be freed when Martha died  but she freed them 12 months after his death  Chernow says   By freeing his slaves Washington accomplished     what no other founding father dared to do  He brought the American experience that much closer to the ideals of the American revolution   181  Religion Main article  George Washington and religion Stained glass window of Washington kneeling in prayer  Capitol Prayer Room  U S  Capitol  Washington  D C  Washington was an outspoken leader in calling for religious liberty and tolerance  and used his prestige as general and president to promote good will among Protestants  Catholics  and Jews  He sought to create a national ethos that would enable every American to  in his paraphrase of the Book of Micah  182   sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree and there shall be none to make him afraid   In private and in public he strongly rejected any sign of intolerance  prejudice  and  every species of religious persecution   while hoping that  bigotry and superstition  would be overcome by  truth and reason  in the United States  183  In a letter to George Mason in 1785  Washington wrote that he was not among those alarmed by a bill  making people pay towards the support of that  religion  which they profess   but felt that it was  impolitic  to pass such a measure  and wished it had never been proposed  believing that it would disturb public tranquility  184  As president he made a point of being seen attending services at numerous churches  including Presbyterian  Quaker  Congregational and Catholic  As president he officially saluted 22 religious groups and proclaimed his general support for religion  185  Washington was known for his generosity  Highly gregarious  he attended many charity events and donated money to colleges  schools and to the poor  As Philadelphia s leading citizen  President Washington took the lead in providing charity to widows and orphans hit by the yellow fever epidemic that devastated the capital city in 1793  186  In Virginia  Washington was a member of the Anglican Church  187  which had  established status   meaning tax money was used to pay its minister   As a leading land owner he served on the vestry  governing board  for Christ Church in Alexandria  Virginia and for Pohick Church near his Mount Vernon home until the war began  The parish was the unit of local government and the vestry dealt mostly with civic affairs such as roads and poor relief  188  The exact nature of Washington s religious beliefs has been debated by historians and biographers for over two hundred years  Washington rarely discussed or wrote about his religious and philosophical opinions in any great detail  yet he frequently displayed a humble and gracious respect toward God in his personal letters and public speeches  Washington frequently accompanied his wife to church services  Although third hand reports say he took communion  189  he is usually characterized as never or rarely participating in the rite  190  191  He would regularly leave services before communion with the other non communicants  as was the custom of the day   until  after being admonished by a rector  he ceased attending at all on communion Sundays  192  Eyewitness accounts exist of Washington engaging in morning devotions  Biographer Jared Sparks recorded the following account from Washington s nephew George W  Lewis   Mr  Lewis said he had accidentally witnessed  Washington s  private devotions in his library both morning and evening  that on those occasions he had seen him in a kneeling position with a Bible open before him and that he believed such to have been his daily practice   193  During the Revolutionary war  General Robert Porterfield stated he  found him on his knees  engaged in his morning s devotions   Alexander Hamilton corroborated Porterfield s account  stating  such was his most constant habit   194  A French citizen who knew Washington well during the Revolutionary War and the presidency stated  Every day of the year  he rises at five in the morning  as soon as he is up  he dresses  then prays reverently to God   195  Indeed  Washington had purchased a prayer book  with the New Version of Psalms  amp  good plain Type  a few years before the Revolutionary War  196  Historians have different views on the question  Paul F  Boller  Jr  has argued that  Washington was in fact a typical 18th century deist   197  198  David L  Holmes describes Washington as a Christian deist by arguing that his religious behavior fell somewhere between that of an orthodox Christian and a strict deist  199  Historian Gordon Wood notes that Washington rarely or never prayed to or mentioned Jesus Christ  Instead he prayed to  providence   which was the favorite term for the deity of the Deists  200  On the other hand theologian Peter Lillback  the the president of Westminster Theological Seminary  argues in his book George Washington s Sacred Fire that Washington was an orthodox Christian within the framework of his time  201  Lillback has explained more recently that evidence unavailable to earlier historians shows that  Washington referred to himself frequently using the words  ardent    fervent    pious   and  devout   There are over one hundred different prayers composed and written by Washington in his own hand  with his own words  in his writings    Although he never once used the word  Deist  in his voluminous writings  he often mentioned religion  Christianity  and the Gospel    Historians ought no longer be permitted to do the legerdemain of turning Washington into a Deist even if they found it necessary and acceptable to do so in the past  Simply put  it is time to let the words and writings of Washington s faith speak for themselves  202  Biographer Ron Chernow  author of the Pulitzer Prize winning book  Washington  A Life  has acknowledged the profound role Washington attributed to Providence  There has been a huge controversy  to put it mildly  about Washington s religious beliefs  Before the Revolutionary War he was Anglican   Church of England   which meant after the war  he was Episcopalian  So  he was clearly Christian    He was quite intensely religious  because even though he uses the word Providence  he constantly sees Providence as an active force in life  particularly in American life  I mean  every single victory in war he credits to Providence  The miracle of the Constitutional Convention he credits to Providence  The creation of the federal government and the prosperity of the early republic  he credits to Providence    I was struck at how frequently in his letters he s referring to Providence  and it s Providence where there s a sense of design and purpose  which sounds to me very much like religion    Unfortunately  this particular issue has become very very politicized  203  Freemasonry Washington was initiated into Freemasonry in 1752  204  Washington had a high regard for the Masonic Order and often praised it  but he seldom attended lodge meetings  He was attracted by the movement s dedication to the Enlightenment principles of rationality  reason and fraternalism  the American lodges did not share the anti clerical perspective that made the European lodges so controversial  205  In 1777  a convention of Virginia lodges recommended Washington to be the Grand Master of the newly established Grand Lodge of Virginia  however  Washington declined  due to his necessity to lead the Continental Army at a critical stage  and because he had never been installed as Master or Warden of a lodge  he did not consider it Masonically legal to serve as Grand Master  206  In 1788  Washington  with his personal consent  was named Master in the Virginia charter of Alexandria Lodge No  22  207  Postage and currency See also  US Presidents on US postage stamps Since 1847  one of the defining hallmarks of a U S  President is his appearance on U S  currency and postage  George Washington appears on contemporary U S  currency  including the one dollar bill and the U S  quarter dollar  On U S  postage stamps Washington  along with Benjamin Franklin  appeared on the nation s first postage stamps in 1847  thereafter appearing numerous times  more than all other presidents combined  145  Selected issues Washington  general issue of 1862  24c   Washington  general issue of 1895

Genealogical relationships of Presidents of the United States List of federal judges appointed by George Washington List of Presidents of the United States  sortable by previous experience Town Destroyer  a nickname given to Washington by the Iroquois Notes   Contemporary records  which used the Julian calendar  recorded his birth as February 11  1731  The provisions of the British Calendar  New Style  Act 1750  implemented in 1752  altered the official British dating method to the Gregorian calendar with the start of the year on January 1  it had been March 25   These changes resulted in dates being moved forward 11 days  and for those between January 1 and March 25  an advance of one year  For a further explanation  see  Old Style and New Style dates    Ellis and Ferling  for example  do not discuss this stance in reference to Washington s French and Indian War service  and cast it almost exclusively in terms of his negative experiences dealing with the Continental Congress during the Revolution  See Ellis  2004  p  218   Ferling  2009  pp  32 33  200  258 272  316   Don Higginbotham places Washington s first formal advocacy of a strong central government in 1783  Higginbotham  2002  p  37     The term comes from the Roman strategy used by General Fabius against Hannibal s invasion in the Second Punic War    Ferling and Ellis argue that Washington favored Fabian tactics and Higginbotham denies it  Ferling  2010  pp  212  264   Ellis  2004  p  11   Higginbotham  1971  p  211     Under the Articles of Confederation  Congress called its presiding officer  President of the United States in Congress Assembled   That person had no executive powers  but the similarity of titles has confused some into thinking there were other presidents before Washington  98    Under the system in place at the time  each elector cast two votes  with the winner becoming president and the runner up vice president  All electors in the elections of 1789 and 1792 cast one of their votes for Washington  thus it may be said that he was elected president unanimously    At least three modern medical authors  Wallenborn  1997   Shapiro 1975  Scheidemandel 1976  have concluded that Washington most probably died from acute bacterial epiglottitis complicated by the treatments given  all of which were accepted medical practice of that era   See Vadakan  2005  Footnotes  for these references  also his article s quotation of Doctors James Craik and Elisha C  Dick s account in the Times of Alexandria  newspaper  of what happened during their treatment of Washington  These treatments included administering multiple doses of calomel  as well as performing extensive bloodletting  with a total of 3 75 liters of blood taken  The massive deliberate blood loss contributed to the additional serious complication of shock    The earliest known image in which Washington is identified as the Father of  His Our the  Country is in the frontispiece of a 1779 German language almanac  With calculations by David Rittenhouse and published by Francis Bailey in Lancaster County Pennsylvania  Der Gantz Neue Nord Americanishe Calendar has Fame appearing with an image of Washington  holding a trumpet to her lips from which the words  Der Landes Vater   translated as  the father of the country  or  the father of the land   comes forth    In Bell  2005   William Gardner Bell states that when Washington was recalled back into military service from his retirement in 1798   Congress passed legislation that would have made him General of the Armies of the United States  but his services were not required in the field and the appointment was not made until the Bicentennial in 1976  when it was bestowed posthumously as a commemorative honor   How many U S  Army five star generals have there been and who were they  states that with Public Law 94 479  President Ford specified that Washington would  rank first among all officers of the Army  past and present   General of the Armies of the United States  is only associated with two people   one being Washington and the other being John J  Pershing    The rest of the Top 20 street names are all descriptive  Hill  View and so on   arboreal  Pine  Maple  etc   or numeric  Second  Third  etc      The Smithsonian Institution states in  The Portrait George Washington  A National Treasure  that  Stuart admired the sculpture of Washington by French artist Jean Antoine Houdon  probably because it was based on a life mask and therefore extremely accurate  Stuart explained   When I painted him  he had just had a set of false teeth inserted  which accounts for the constrained expression so noticeable about the mouth and lower part of the face  Houdon s bust does not suffer from this defect  I wanted him as he looked at that time   Stuart preferred the Athenaeum pose and  except for the gaze  used the same pose for the Lansdowne painting  167  References   Chernow  Ron  2010 10 18    Ron Chernow on
