Oriental Republic of Uruguay  The Eastern Republic of Uruguay  or the Republic East of the Uruguay  The last is actually the only correct literal translation  as it is named after its geographic location to the east of the Uruguay River  Because of the ambiguity in its meaning when translated  the government of Uruguay normally uses simply Uruguay in English  The etymology of the Uruguay River  coming from the Guaran  language  is uncertain  but the official meaning 18  is  river of painted birds    edit  History Main article  History of Uruguay  edit  Early history and colonization The only documented inhabitants of Uruguay before European colonization of the area were the Charr a  a small tribe driven south by the Guaran  of Paraguay  8  The Spanish arrived in the territory of present day Uruguay in 1516 but the people s fierce resistance to conquest  combined with the absence of gold and silver  limited their settlement in the region during the 16th and 17th centuries  8  Uruguay then became a zone of contention between the Spanish and the Portuguese empires  In 1603 the Spanish began to introduce cattle  which became a source of wealth in the region  The first permanent settlement on the territory of present day Uruguay was founded by the Spanish in 1624 at Soriano on the R o Negro  In 1669 71 the Portuguese built a fort at Colonia del Sacramento  Spanish colonization increased as Spain sought to limit Portugal s expansion of Brazil s frontiers  citation needed  Montevideo was founded by the Spanish in the early 18th century as a military stronghold  Its natural harbor soon developed into a commercial area competing with Argentina s capital  Buenos Aires  8  Uruguay s early 19th century history was shaped by ongoing fights between the British  Spanish  Portuguese  and other colonial forces for dominance in the Platine region  8  In 1806 and 1807  the British army attempted to seize Buenos Aires and Montevideo as part of the Napoleonic Wars  As a result Montevideo was occupied by a British force from February to September 1807   edit  Independence struggle Further information  Banda Oriental  Liga Federal  and Cisplatina The oath of the Thirty Three Orientals In 1811  Jos  Gervasio Artigas  who became Uruguay s national hero  launched a successful revolution against the Spanish authorities  defeating them on 18 May at the Battle of Las Piedras  8  In 1813  the new government in Buenos Aires convened a constituent assembly where Artigas emerged as a champion of federalism  demanding political and economic autonomy for each area  and for the Banda Oriental in particular  19  The assembly refused to seat the delegates from the Banda Oriental however  and Buenos Aires pursued a system based on unitary centralism  19  Consequently Artigas broke with Buenos Aires and besieged Montevideo  taking the city in early 1815  19  Once the troops from Buenos Aires had withdrawn  the Banda Oriental appointed its first autonomous government  19  Artigas organized the Federal League under his protection  consisting of six provinces  four of which are now part of Argentina  19  In 1816  a force of 10 000 Portuguese troops invaded the Banda Oriental from Brazil and took Montevideo in January 1817  19  After nearly four more years of struggle Portuguese Brazil annexed the Banda Oriental as a province under the name of Cisplatina  19  The Brazilian Empire became independent from Portugal in 1822  In response to the annexation  the Thirty Three Orientals  led by Juan Antonio Lavalleja  declared independence on 25 August 1825 supported by the United Provinces of the R o de la Plata  present day Argentina   8  This led to the 500 day long Argentina Brazil War  Neither side gained the upper hand and in 1828 the Treaty of Montevideo  fostered by the United Kingdom  gave birth to Uruguay as an independent state  The nation s first constitution was adopted on 18 July 1830  8   edit  Blancos Colorados conflicts Further information  Uruguayan Civil War Manuel Oribe Battle of Caseros At the time of independence  Uruguay had an estimated population of just under 75 000  20  The political scene in Uruguay became split between two parties  the conservative Blancos  Whites  headed by Manuel Oribe  representing the agricultural interests of the countryside  and the liberal Colorados  Reds  led by Fructuoso Rivera  representing the business interests of Montevideo  The Uruguayan parties became associated with warring political factions in neighbouring Argentina  The Colorados favored the exiled Argentinian liberal Unitarios  many of whom had taken refuge in Montevideo while the Blanco president Manuel Oribe was a close friend of the Argentinian ruler Manuel de Rosas  On 15 June 1838  an army led by the Colorado leader Rivera overthrew the president  who fled to Argentina  20  Rivera declared war on Rosas in 1839  The conflict would last thirteen years and become known as the Guerra Grande  the Great War   20  In 1843  an Argentinian army overran Uruguay on Oribe s behalf but failed to take the capital  The siege of Montevideo  which began in February 1843  would last nine years  21  The besieged Uruguayans called on resident foreigners for help which led to a French and an Italian legion being formed  the latter led by the exiled Giuseppe Garibaldi  21   Hitherto unknown  it was Garibaldi s fame in this war which led to his later central role in the Unification of Italy   In 1845  Britain and France intervened against Rosas to restore commerce to normal levels in the region  Their efforts proved ineffective and by 1849  tired of the war  both withdrew after signing a treaty favorable to Rosas  21  It appeared that Montevideo would finally fall when an uprising against Rosas  led by Justo Jos  de Urquiza governor of Argentina s Entre R os Province began  The Brazilian intervention in May 1851 on behalf of the Colorados  combined with the uprising  changed the situation and Oribe was defeated  The siege of Montevideo was lifted and the Guerra Grande finally came to an end  21  Montevideo rewarded Brazil s support by signing treaties that confirmed Brazil s right to intervene in Uruguay s internal affairs  21  In accordance with the 1851 treaties  Brazil intervened militarily in Uruguay as often as it deemed necessary  22  In 1865  the Triple Alliance was formed by the emperor of Brazil  the president of Argentina  and the Colorado general Venancio Flores  the Uruguayan head of government whom they both had helped to gain power  The Triple Alliance declared war on Paraguayan leader Francisco Solano L pez 22  and the resulting War of the Triple Alliance ended with the invasion of Paraguay and its defeat by the armies of the three countries  Montevideo  which was used as a supply station by the Brazilian navy  experienced a period of prosperity and relative calm during the war  22  The constitutional government of General Lorenzo Batlle y Grau  1868 72  was forced to suppress an insurrection led by the National Party  23  After two years of struggle  a peace agreement was signed in 1872 that gave the Blancos a share in the emoluments and functions of government  through control of four of the departments of Uruguay  23  This establishment of the policy of co participation represented the search for a new formula of compromise  based on the coexistence of the party in power and the party in opposition  23  Between 1875 and 1886  the military became the center of power  24  During this authoritarian period  the government took steps toward the organization of the country as a modern state  encouraging its economic and social transformation  Pressure groups  consisting mainly of businessmen  hacendados  and industrialists  were organized and had a strong influence on government  24  A transition period  1886 90  followed  during which politicians began recovering lost ground and some civilian participation in government occurred  24   edit  Mass immigration and development Juan Idiarte Borda After the Guerra Grande  there was a sharp rise in the number of immigrants  primarily from Italy and Spain  By 1879  the total population of the country was over 438 000  25  The economy saw a steep upswing  above all in livestock raising and exports  25  Montevideo became a major economic centre of the region and an entrep t for goods from Argentina  Brazil and Paraguay  25  The Colorado leader Jos  Batlle y Ord  ez was elected president in 1903  26  The following year  the Blancos led a rural revolt and eight bloody months of fighting ensued before their leader  Aparicio Saravia  was killed in battle  Government forces emerged victorious  leading to the end of the co participation politics that had begun in 1872  26 Batlle had two terms  1903 07 and 1911 15  during which  and taking advantage of the nation s stability and growing economic prosperity  he instituted major reforms such as a welfare program  government participation in many facets of the economy  and a plural executive  8  Gabriel Terra became president in March 1931  His inauguration coincided with the effects of the Great Depression  27  when the social climate became tense as a result of the lack of jobs  There were confrontations in which police and leftists died  27  In 1933  Terra organized a coup d  tat  dissolving the General Assembly and governing by decree  27  A new constitution was promulgated in 1934  transferring powers to the president  27  In general  the Terra government weakened or neutralized economic nationalism and social reform  27  In 1938  general elections were held and Terra s brother in law  General Alfredo Baldomir  was elected president  Under pressure from organized labor and the National Party Baldomir advocated free elections  freedom of the press  and a new constitution  28  Although Baldomir declared Uruguay neutral in 1939 British warships and the German ship Admiral Graf Spee fought a battle not far off Uruguay s coast  28  Admiral Graf Spee took refuge in Montevideo  claiming sanctuary in a neutral port  but was later ordered out  28  In 1945  Uruguay abandoned its policy of neutrality and joined the Allied cause  In the late 1950s  partly because of a world wide decrease in demand for agricultural products  Uruguayans suffered from a steep drop in the standard of living which led to student militancy and labor unrest  An urban guerrilla movement known as the Tupamaros emerged  engaging in activities such as robbing banks and distributing the proceeds to the poor in addition to attempting political dialogue  As the government banned their political activities and the police became more oppressive  the Tupamaros took up an overtly armed struggle  29  verification needed  President Jorge Pacheco declared a state of emergency in 1968  followed by a further suspension of civil liberties in 1972  In 1973  amid increasing economic and political turmoil  the armed forces closed the Congress and established a civilian military regime  8  Around 180 Uruguayans are known to have been killed during the 12 year military rule from 1973 1985  30  Most were killed in Argentina and other neighbouring countries  with only 36 of them having been killed in Uruguay  31   edit  Return to democracy Former president of Uruguay Jorge Batlle with former American president George H W  Bush A new constitution  drafted by the military  was rejected in a November 1980 referendum  8  Following the referendum the armed forces announced a plan for the return to civilian rule  and national elections were held in 1984  8 Colorado Party leader Julio Mar a Sanguinetti won the presidency and served from 1985 to 1990  The first Sanguinetti administration implemented economic reforms and consolidated democracy following the country s years under military rule  8  The National Party s Luis Alberto Lacalle won the 1989 presidential

formal coalition ended in November 2002 when the Blancos withdrew their ministers from the cabinet  8  although the Blancos continued to support the Colorados on most issues  Low commodity prices and economic difficulties in Uruguay s main export markets  first in Brazil with the devaluation of the real then in Argentina in 2002  caused a severe recession the economy contracted by 11   unemployment climbed to 21  and the percentage of Uruguayans in poverty rose to over 30   33  In 2004  Uruguayans elected Tabar  V zquez as president  while giving the Broad Front a majority in both

nationwide  56  Seasonal variations are pronounced  but extremes in temperature are rare  56  As would be expected by its abundance of water  high humidity and fog are common  56  The absence of mountains  which act as weather barriers  makes all locations vulnerable to high winds and rapid changes in weather as fronts or storms sweep across the country  56  Both summer and winter weather may
