Banner  Ph D   M D   Bill Bixby   is a physician and scientist employed at the fictitious  Culver Institute  presumably headed by Dr  Benjamin Culver  Charles Siebert  who is traumatized by the car accident that killed his beloved wife Laura  Haunted by his inability to save her  Banner  in partnership with Dr  Elaina Harding Marks  Susan Sullivan   who also works at the Culver Institute  studies a total of seventy eight incidents of people who  while in danger  somehow managed to summon superhuman strength in order to save their loved ones  He concludes that high levels of gamma radiation from sunspots are the cause  and the emotional stress experienced in these situations combined with the gamma radiation altered the body chemistry to cause an increase in strength  In a tragic twist  it is revealed that while his own body would have been the most receptive to the sunspot based gamma augmentation  the car accident that claimed his wife had occurred on a day with the least sunspot based gamma activity  To test his theory  he bombards his own body with gamma radiation  Unknown to Banner  his equipment has been upgraded  causing him to administer a far higher dose of gamma radiation to himself than he had intended  He attempts to lift a heavy object to test his strength  but is unable to  so he leaves the lab angrily  thinking the experiment has failed  Driving home in a heavy rainstorm  he suffers a flat tire and injures himself while trying to change it  The anger resulting from the pain triggers his first transformation into the Incredible Hulk  Lou Ferrigno   a 7 foot tall  2 1 m   330 pound  green skinned savage creature  with a sub human mind and superhuman strength  The Hulk destroys Banner s car and wanders off into the nearby woods  The next morning  the Hulk stumbles upon a girl who is camping with her father  and attempts to befriend her  a la The Monster in Frankenstein   In the ensuing confusion  the Hulk is shot by the girl s father  but manages to escape  Once calm and unharrassed  he eventually transforms back into Banner who has no memory of the tire changing incident  or the events thereafter  Unsure of how to proceed  Banner seeks out his research partner  Dr  Marks  Her amazement at Banner s healing powers  his gunshot wound is nearly healed  is replaced by shock and horror when Banner tells her that he bombarded himself with gamma radiation  Banner and Marks relocate to a laboratory isolated from the rest of the Culver Institute but still on its grounds  locking him in an experimental pressure chamber designed for deep underwater use  they hope that if he metamorphoses again  it will hold the creature  Banner initially suspects that his transformation had been caused by the lightning and or rain  both of which he was experiencing at the time  and they simulate analogous conditions in the chamber  When this fails to induce a transformation  he lies down to get some sleep  Banner then has his recurring nightmare of the accident that killed his wife  which causes him to transform and the creature violently escapes from the chamber  Dr  Marks takes a blood sample from the Hulk s wounded hands and guides him to a couch  where he calms down and returns to normal  They then realize that the Hulk has a very high metabolism and healing rate and that the transformation is caused by strong negative emotions  such as anger  Banner summarizes the implications by saying   That means it s uncontrollable   While Banner and Dr  Marks try to reverse the process  a reporter for a fictitious tabloid called the National Register named Jack McGee  Jack Colvin   who was previously investigating Banner s research but is now investigating the reported sighting of the Hulk  intrudes on the lab  When the scientists refuse to speak to him  McGee suspects they know more than they are letting on and sneaks into the lab  hiding in a cupboard where he accidentally knocks over a chemical container  Banner catches McGee hiding and removes him from the premises  warning McGee with a smile   Mr  McGee  don t make me angry  You wouldn t like me when I m angry   But as he confronts McGee outside  the spilled chemicals  unseen by Banner  result in the lab catching fire  Banner rushes back into the lab to save Elaina  and the stress of the smoke fumes triggers a transformation into the Hulk  The Hulk carries Elaina away from the inferno into the woodland  She reveals her love for David before she dies from injuries she sustained in the explosion  McGee witnesses the Hulk carrying her away  and surmises that the Hulk started the fire and killed both Banner and Marks  Although the authorities are skeptical of the existence of the creature McGee tells them about  he reports the creature to the police and publishes a front page headline in the National Register that proclaims   Incredible  Hulk  Kills 2  before vowing to track down the creature so he can catch it and bring it to the law s attention  It is at this point the series begins McGee vows to capture Marks s and Banner s killer  Banner  now presumed dead  is forced to go into hiding while trying to find a cure for his condition  In a manner vaguely similar to the popular series The Fugitive  this forms the basis of the TV series  Banner endlessly drifts from place to place  assuming different identities and odd jobs to support himself and sometimes to enable his research  Along the way  Banner finds himself feeling obliged to help the people he meets out of whatever troubles have befallen them  Often Banner s inner struggle is paralleled by the dilemmas of the people he encounters  who find in Banner a sympathetic helper  As Kenneth Johnson stated   What we were constantly doing was looking for thematic ways to touch   on  the various ways that the Hulk sort of manifested itself in everyone  In Bixby and his character  David Banner  it happened to be anger  In someone else  it might be obsession  or it might be fear  or it might be jealousy or alcoholism  The Hulk comes in many shapes and sizes  That s what we tried to delve into in the individual episodes   6  Despite his attempts to stay calm no matter how badly he is treated  Banner inevitably finds himself in dangerous situations that trigger his transformations into the Hulk  Meanwhile  McGee continues to pursue the incredible story of the mysterious monster  whom he believes got away with a double murder  Ultimately  Banner changes someone s life for the better or even saves a person s life  Nonetheless  he almost always flees the town  scared that publicity over the Hulk s rampages will eventually bring unwanted scrutiny of him from the local authorities and or McGee  The episodes usually end with Banner hitch hiking down some outbound highway or road  with a strikingly haunting and sad piano solo version of the series theme music playing as the ending credits visualize  The mood conveys Banner s inner sense of hopelessness  the quest of a man desperate to one day find the cure that will bring him peace  an end to his endless running  and the ability to reclaim a normal life   edit  Production  edit  Development In early 1977  Frank Price  head of Universal Television  offered producer and writer Kenneth Johnson a deal to develop a TV show based on any of several characters they had licensed from the Marvel Comics library  Johnson turned down the offer at first  but then  while reading the Victor Hugo novel Les Mis rables he became inspired and began working to develop the Hulk comic into a TV show  7  8  Johnson changed the name of the Hulk s comic book alter ego  Dr   Robert  Bruce Banner  to Dr  David Banner for the TV series  This change was made  according to Johnson  because he did not want the series to be perceived as a comic book series  so he wanted to change what he felt was a staple of comic books  and Stan Lee s comics in particular  that major characters frequently had alliterative names  9  According to Lou Ferrigno  it was also changed because CBS thought the name Bruce sounded  too gay ish   a rationale that Ferrigno thought was  the most absurd  ridiculous thing I d ever heard   10  On the DVD commentary of the pilot of The Incredible Hulk  Johnson also says that it was a way to honor his son David   Bruce  ultimately became the TV Banner s middle name  as it had been in the comics  It is visible on Banner s tombstone at the end of the pilot movie  and that footage is shown at the beginning of every episode of the series  In an interview with Kenneth Johnson on the Season 2 DVD  he explains that he had also wanted the Hulk to be colored red rather than green  His reasons given for this were because red  not green  is perceived as the color of rage  and also because red is a  human color  whereas green is not  However  Stan Lee  a co creator of the Hulk comics and executive at Marvel Comics at the time  said that the Hulk s color was not something that could be changed  because of its iconic image  9  Johnson also omitted the comic book s supporting characters from his TV adaptation  Instead  he opted for a variety of more realistic characters  most of whom changed with each episode  Additionally  Johnson changed the character s origin story  Rather than being exposed to gamma rays during a botched atomic testing explosion  Banner was gamma irradiated in a more low key laboratory mishap  to reduce the level of comic book sensationalism and thus make the origin more believable  Yet another significant change was altering Banner s occupation  from nuclear physicist to medical researcher physician  Although the comic book Hulk s degree of speaking ability has varied over the years  the television Hulk did not speak at all he merely growled and roared repeatedly  Another limitation on the Hulk was his strength  In the comics  the Hulk is capable of surviving nuclear explosions and lifting mountains  The television Hulk could only take down bulldozers  hold a car compressor with some strain or smash down walls or doors  This Hulk could also be hurt  injured or killed  but still retained a healing factor  Finally  despite its Marvel Comics roots  fantasy and science fiction themes were minimized in the series  There were no supervillains or references to the rest of the Marvel Universe  In the majority of episodes  the only science fiction element was the Hulk himself   edit  Casting For the role of Dr  David Banner  Kenneth Johnson cast seasoned television actor Bill Bixby his first choice for the role  At first  Bixby resisted accepting the part  but after reading the script  he quickly signed on  Next  character actor Jack Colvin was cast as  Jack McGee   the series  recurring antagonist  Modeled after the character of Javert in Les Mis rables  McGee was a cynical tabloid newspaper reporter who relentlessly pursued the Hulk after witnessing the urban legend  The most daunting task  however  was finding someone to play the Hulk  Arnold Schwarzenegger auditioned for the role but was rejected due to his inadequate height  according to Johnson in his commentary on a DVD release   Actor Richard Kiel was hired for the role  During filming  however  Kenneth Johnson s own son pointed out that Kiel s tall but under developed physique did not resemble the Hulk s at all  Soon  Kiel was replaced with professional bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno  although a very brief shot of Kiel  as the Hulk  remains in the pilot  According to an interview with Kiel  who sees properly out of only one eye   he reacted badly to the contact lenses used for the role  and also found the green makeup difficult to remove  so he did not mind losing the part  11  Initially the facial make up for the Hulk was quite monstrous  but after both pilots  the first two weekly episodes and New York location shooting for the fourth  the design was toned down  12  The makeup process used to transform Ferrigno into the Hulk took three hours  The hard contact lenses Ferrigno wore to simulate the Hulk s electric green eyes had to be removed every 15 minutes because he found wearing them physically painful  and the green fright wig he wore as the Hulk was made of dyed yak hair  10   edit  Opening narration One constant of the series was the opening narration  Ted Cassidy  who provided the vocal growls and roars of the creature in seasons one and two  10  was the narrator  13  The opening went as follows  Dr  David Banner  physician  scientist  Searching for a way to tap into the hidden strengths that all humans have  Then an accidental overdose of gamma radiation alters his body chemistry  And now when David Banner grows angry or outraged  a startling metamorphosis occurs  The creature is driven by rage and pursued by an investigative reporter   Banner    Mr  McGee  don t make me angry  You wouldn t like me when I m angry   The creature is wanted for a murder he didn t commit  David Banner is believed to be dead  and he must let the world think that he is dead  until he can find a way to control the raging spirit that dwells within him  Prior to the beginning of the series  a different version was used for the second pilot movie  Return of the Incredible Hulk  later known as Death in the Family   Dr  David Banner  physician  scientist  Searching for a way to tap into the hidden strengths that all humans have  Then an accidental overdose of gamma radiation interacts with his unique body chemistry  And now when David Banner grows angry or outraged  a startling metamorphosis occurs  The creature is driven by rage and pursued by an investigative reporter   Banner    Mr  McGee  don t make me angry  You wouldn t like me when I m angry   An accidental explosion took the life of a fellow scientist and supposedly David Banner as well  The reporter thinks the creature was responsible   McGee    I gave a description to all the law enforcement agencies  They got a warrant for murder out on him   A murder which David Banner can never prove he or the creature didn t commit  So he must let the world go on thinking that he  too  is dead  until he can find a way to control the raging spirit that dwells within him   edit  Music Joseph  Joe  Harnell  one of Kenneth Johnson s favorite composers  composed the music for The Incredible Hulk  He was brought into the production due to his involvement with the series The Bionic Woman  which Johnson had also created and produced  The score used at the beginning and closing credits was a piano piece called  The Lonely Man   Portions of  The Lonely Man  can be heard in the 2008 film The Incredible Hulk  14  Some of the series music was collected into a soundtrack   edit  Broadcast history The Incredible Hulk was the beginning series of the highly rated Friday night block on CBS  where it was followed by The Dukes of Hazzard and Dallas  The series lineup began as such in 1979 and remained that way until 1981  when the Hulk moved to a new night during the abbreviated fifth and final season  The series has aired as reruns on the Sci Fi Channel and on RTV  The show now reairs on Monday nights at 11 45pm on Malaysia s  Media Prima s channel 8TV  In the United Kingdom  the series was shown by ITV  who later repeated it in the late 1980s  The series was run through by Channel 5 in the late 1990s   edit  Story arc See also  List of The Incredible Hulk episodes As the series progressed  Banner s character and the animalistic nature of the Hulk were frequently explored and expanded upon  with the viewer continuously learning more about the psychology of both Banner and the Hulk  The Hulk s personality was shown to still reflect Banner s good and compassionate nature  meaning he will typically restrict his wrath to villains threatening him  but will also restrict himself to simply tossing them aside  instead of killing them  Although the Hulk s intelligence is low  he retains the same motivations and priorities as Banner  always managing to protect people or objects that Banner deems important as well as attacking those he feels fear or hostility toward  The Hulk also has a soft spot towards women  children and animals  However  as Banner s normal personality becomes dormant to the Hulk s in that form  and he has no memory of the creature s actions  Banner lives in constant worry of what damage the Hulk causes during those episodes  fearing that someday the Hulk may unwittingly hurt or kill an innocent person  The character of the antagonist Jack McGee underwent significant development throughout the course of the series  Although initially perceived as cynical and conniving in the beginning  the viewer s sympathy for McGee increases as the series progresses  as McGee gradually comes to realize the Hulk may not be as dangerous as he initially thought  particularly following several instances in episodes such as  The Hulk Breaks Las Vegas  in which he has his own life saved by the creature  In season two s two part episode  Mystery Man   McGee finally learns the shocking truth that the creature he has been pursuing for the past two years is in reality a man most of the time  making things more difficult for Banner from then on as he now subsequently finds McGee s pursuits more difficult than ever to avoid as McGee is now on a constant lookout for the man as well as the creature  In the same episode  we learn that McGee hopes to catch the Hulk so that the inevitable media sensation will advance his own dwindling career  However  subsequent episodes such as season three s  Proof Positive  show that McGee s real intentions lie much deeper than this  and that his main motive is purely to understand this fascinating creature  to whom his references as the Hulk are not shared by other characters  for himself  for his amazement at the existence of such a remarkable creature has caused him to become totally obsessed with the Hulk to the extent that it has ruined his personal life  the Hulk is permanently on his mind  and his annoyance over his lack of success in catching the Hulk is exacerbated by other people s refusal even to believe that the Hulk actually exists not even his own colleagues at the National Register take the story seriously  and they view him as a laughing stock for believing that the Hulk is real   edit

two hour movie in September 1978  David approaches Dr  Carolyn Fields  Mariette Hartley  about a new form of hypnotic therapy  He learns that Carolyn has devised the therapy because she is terminally ill with a syndrome  similar  to ALS  or Lou Gehrig s Disease  and has been given no more than eight weeks to live  David reveals his true identity to her  and both agree to help each other  using a tissue sample from the creature to possibly cure Carolyn of her illness  They fall in love and eventually marry  After Carolyn obtains the sample while David has metamorphosed into the Hulk  she prepares the sample for her own use  The day the procedure to cure Carolyn is to take place  a hurricane hits the island  While the pair are driving to the hospital  Carolyn suffers from another painful episode  this time leading her to flee their moving car  David stops the car and rushes after her  morphing into the Hulk once more  He catches her in his arms  and as she attempts to fight him in her pain induced hysteria  she turns around and sees the Hulk  and stops struggling  Knowing her time has come  Carolyn embraces the Hulk  telling him  as David  she will miss him as she dies in his arms  Mariette Hartley won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for this moving performance  In season two s  Kindred Spirits   Dr  Gabrielle White Cloud  played by Kim Cattrall  comes across evidence that a Hulk type metamorphosis had occurred at the dawn of mankind in America 30 000 years ago  This evidence included a cave painting of a transformation and a skull that Gabrielle claims to be two skulls at once  and which David suggests died while metamorphosing  Gabrielle tries to help David  but the plant that they thought had cured the prehistoric hulks has since become extinct  In season two s  Mystery Man   McGee finally comes face to face with an amnesia ridden David Banner  although he does not recognize him  for Banner s face is covered by a gauze mask following a severe injury in an auto accident  Banner has been admitted into a hospital as  John Doe  as his true identity is unknown  Investigating an apparent link between this man and the Hulk  McGee hires a small plane for himself and Banner to see a doctor who will be able to cure Banner s amnesia  Lightning strikes the plane and an injured McGee and Banner are trapped in a forest  where they must help one another escape to safety  During the ordeal  McGee sees the mystery man transform into the Hulk and realizes this is how the Hulk manages to get from one place to another without being seen in between  He is eventually separated from the Hulk  but vows to track down the mysterious  John Doe  fellow and find out his true identity  In the season four two part  Prometheus   David rescues and befriends Katie Maxwell  Laurie Prange   a young woman recently blinded by an accident  While helping her through the woods near her home  a meteor lands near them  Banner investigates  and is sickened by the radiation emanating from the meteorite fragment  An attacking swarm of bees triggers his transformation into the Hulk  and in the process of fighting off the bees  the Hulk touches the meteorite  He retreats back to Katie s cabin  but in metamorphosing back into David  the process stops midway  with David retaining some of the Hulk s bulk and irradiated features  but with the ability to speak  Additionally  David had also retained most of the Hulk s child like intellect  Horrified at realizing that his transformation has gone wrong  David enlists Katie s help  The military  however  arrives and after attempting to evade them  David transforms back into the Hulk  The Hulk and Katie are captured and taken to a military installation  where a group of scientists working for the Prometheus Project mistakenly believe that the Hulk is an alien  After seeing a tape of David s transformation  however  they realize that the Hulk is actually a man who transforms into the creature  McGee  meanwhile  finagles his way onto the base and finds Katie  attempting to get her to give him more information on  John Doe   The Hulk escapes from his confinement and finds Katie  After the Hulk s transformation back into David again stops midway  Katie theorizes that the radiation from the meteorite is affecting David s unique body chemistry and that they need to escape from the base and get away from the meteorite  McGee  meanwhile  convinces the brass to let him talk to  John  and convince him to surrender  McGee finds them  but due to David s altered appearance  does not realize that he is  in fact  talking to David Banner  It is a double cross  however  as soldiers move in on David and Katie  David transforms into the Hulk once again and breaks out of the installation with Katie  Far from the meteorite fragment  the Hulk transforms back completely into David Banner with no ill effects  In the episode  Dark Side   Banner s experiment with a mood altering chemical goes disastrously wrong with himself becoming psychotically violent  which makes his next transformation into the Hulk an extremely dangerous experience to everyone around him  Fortunately  Banner is able to inject an antidote right before transforming into the Hulk again in a crisis and the Hulk reverts to his good nature to save the day  In the two part episode  The First   David discovers that another man transformed into a Hulk like creature 30 years ago  In this case  a doctor used gamma radiation in an attempt to heal a man in poor health named Dell Frye  Harry Townes   who was embittered by bullying from the local townspeople  causing him to become vengeful and cruel  However  the radiation turned him instead into a savage green creature  Dick Durock   Because of Frye s difference in personality  his creature had killed people  Dr  Jeffrey Clive  long dead  had discovered the cure  but Frye  now old and arthritic  and still bullied  wants to have the power again  David discovers Dr  Clive s laboratory  which contains a machine that can harness the sun s gamma radiation  Looking through Clive s journals  he realizes that he needs to take the antidote developed by Clive and then bombard himself with gamma rays for the cure to work  Before he can do so  however  Frye knocks him out and straps himself into the machine  As David awakens and attempts to stop him  Frye is bombarded with gamma radiation  which turns him into a Hulk like creature  After metamorphosing back  Frye discovers that after one transformation  his arthritis has vanished  Seeking revenge for the years of taunts he has endured  Frye goes into town and provokes some of the town bullies into attacking him  He once again transforms into the creature  and proceeds to kill one of the bullies  Realizing that the Frye Hulk is extremely dangerous because of Frye s murderous nature  David manages to subdue Frye and strap him into the machine to reverse the process  Unfortunately  Frye comes to and transforms into the creature  and in the process destroys the last vial of the cure that Dr  Clive had developed  As he literally sees the cure dripping from his fingers  a distraught David transforms into the Hulk  The two creatures fight  with the much more powerful Banner Hulk getting the better of the Frye Hulk  who is eventually shot dead by the sheriff   The First  is the only episode of the TV series to feature any other super humanly powerful characters   The First  remains a fan favorite and is often cited as an example of Bixby s finest acting work in the series  Guest star Townes  performance as Frye is generally regarded as the best and most memorable guest shot in the show s history  The series concludes with a standard 50 minute episode   A Minor Problem    The character of McGee does not appear in this last episode  nor a few other episodes in the short final season  and the series ends on an open note  with Banner still searching for a cure and McGee still unaware of the true identity of his John Doe   edit  Cancellation In 1981  with a major entertainment union strike on the horizon  the production team continued filming
