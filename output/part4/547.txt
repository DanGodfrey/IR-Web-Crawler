Bone Wars   Science and technology in the United States African American contributions Discoveries NASA spinoff Native American contributions Puerto Rican scientists and inventors Technological and industrial history Inventions by date  before 1890   1890 1945   1946 1991   after 1991  Timeline of United States discoveries encompasses the breakthroughs of human thought and knowledge of new scientific findings  phenomena  places  things  and what was previously unknown to exist  From a historical stand point  the timeline below of United States discoveries dates from the 18th century to the 21st century  which have been achieved by discoverers who are either native born or naturalized citizens of the United States  With an emphasis of discoveries in the fields of astronomy  physics  chemistry  medicine  biology  geology  paleontology  and archaeology  United States citizens acclaimed in their professions have contributed much  For example  the  Bone Wars   beginning in 1877 and ending in 1892  was an intense period of rivalry between two American paleontologists  Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh  who initiated several expeditions throughout North America in the pursuit of discovering  identifying  and finding new species of dinosaur fossils  In total  their large efforts resulted in 142 species of dinosaurs being discovered  1  With the founding of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  NASA  in 1958  a vision and continued commitment by the United States of finding extraterrestrial and astronomical discoveries has helped the world to better understand our solar system and universe  As one example  in 2008  the Phoenix Mars Lander discovered the presence of frozen water on the planet Mars of which scientists such as Peter H  Smith of the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory  LPL  had suspected before the mission confirmed its existence  2  Contents 1 Eighteenth century 2 Nineteenth century 3 Twentieth century 4 Twenty first century 5 See also 6 Footnotes  edit  Eighteenth century 1747 Charge conservation In physics  charge conservation is the principle that electric charge can neither be created nor destroyed  The quantity of electric charge  the amount of positive charge minus the amount of negative charge in the universe  is always conserved  As part of his groundbreaking work in electricity  Benjamin Franklin around the year 1747 discovered the principle of charge conservation when he came to the conclusion that the two states of electricity  positive and negative  the charge is never created or destroyed but instead transferable from one place to another  3  1796 Johnston Atoll Johnston Atoll  a territory of the United States  a Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument  and a part of the wider United States Minor Outlying Islands  is a 50 square mile  130 km2  atoll in the North Pacific Ocean about 750 miles  1 400 kilometers  west of the U S  state of Hawaii  There are four islands located on the coral reef platform  two natural islands  Johnston Island and Sand Island  which have been expanded by coral dredging  as well as North Island  Akau  and East Island  Hikina   an additional two artificial islands formed by coral dredging  The sovereignty of Johnston Atoll was disputed and claimed by the Kingdom of Hawaii beginning in 1858 until Hawaii itself was eventually annexed by the United States as the Hawaii Territory in 1898  Johnston Atoll is now administered and managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service  an agency of the United States Department of Interior  In 1796  Johnston Atoll was discovered accidentally by U S  Captain Joseph Pierpoint when his ship  the American brig Sally  ran aground  4  1798 Tabuaeran Tabuaeran  also known as Fanning Island or Fanning Atoll  both Gilbertese and English names are recognized  is one of the Line Islands located in the central Pacific Ocean  With a population of approximately 2 500

North Pacific Ocean almost due south of the Hawaiian Islands  roughly halfway between the U S  state of Hawaii and the U S  territory of American Samoa  The atoll consists of an extensive reef  two shallow lagoons  and some 50 sand and reef rock islets and bars covered with lush  tropical vegetation  The islets of the atoll are all connected  except Sand Island and the two Home Islets in the west and Barren Island in the east  The largest island is Cooper Island in the north  followed by Kaula Island in the south  Cooper Island is privately owned by The Nature Conservancy and managed as a nature reserve  The rest of the atoll is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and is directly administered by the Office of Insular Affairs  an agency of the United States Department of Interior  Palmyra Atoll s history is long and colorful  It was first sighted on June 14  1798  by Captain Edmund Fanning and officially discovered in 1802 by Captain Sawle of the American ship Palmyra  7  1798 Kingman Reef Kingman Reef  a territory of the United States  a Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument  and a part of the wider United States Minor Outlying Islands  is a largely submerged  uninhabited triangular shaped reef  9 5 nautical miles  18 kilometers  east west and 5 nautical miles  9 kilometers  north south  located in the North Pacific Ocean  roughly half way between the Hawaiian Islands and the U S  territory of American Samoa  It is the northernmost of the Northern Line Islands and lies 36 nautical miles  67 kilometers  northwest of the next closest island  the U S  territory of Palmyra Atoll  and 930 nautical miles  1 720 kilometers  south of Honolulu  Hawaii  Kingman Reef is now administered and managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife

century 1821 South Orkney Islands The South Orkney Islands are a group of islands in the Southern Ocean  about 375 miles  604 km  northeast of the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula  As part of the British Antarctic Territory  the islands have a total area of about 240 square miles  620 km2   In December 1821  Captain Nathaniel B  Palmer as commander of the James Monroe  along with British sealer George Powell  co discovered the South Orkney Islands  9  1822 Howland Island Howland Island  a territory of the United States and a part of the United States Minor Outlying Islands  is an uninhabited coral island located just north of the equator in the central Pacific Ocean  about 1 700 nautical miles  3 100 km  southwest of Honolulu  Hawaii  The island lies almost halfway between the U  S state of Hawaii and Australia  Its nearest neighbor is Baker Island  37 nautical miles  68 kilometers  to the south  Now known as a National Wildlife Refuge  Howland Island is an insular area administered and managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service  First known as  Worth Island   Howland Island as it later was named  was discovered by U S  Captain George B  Worth aboard the whaler Oena in 1822  8  1825 Baker Island Baker Island  a territory of the United States and a part of the United States Minor Outlying Islands  is an uninhabited atoll located just north of the equator in the central Pacific Ocean about 1 700 miles  3 100 kilometers  southwest of Honolulu  Hawaii  The island lies almost halfway between the U S  state of Hawaii and Australia  Its nearest neighbor is Howland Island  37 nautical miles  68 kilometers  to the north  Now known as a National Wildlife Refuge  Baker Island is an insular area administered and managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service  According to an article in Pacfici Magazine dated in 2000  Baker island was reportedly first sighted in 1825 by U S  Captain Obed Starbuck in the ship Lopez  The newly discovered island was named New Nantucket  and also as Phoebe   It was in 1832 that U S  Captain Michael Baker  after whom the island is now named  also came to the island aboard the whaler Gideon Howard  10  1831 Chloroform Chloroform is a chemical compound known as trihalomethanes that does not undergo combustion in air  although it will burn when mixed with more flammable substances  Chloroform was first discovered in July 1831 by American physician Samuel Guthrie  independently a few months later by French chemist Eug ne Soubeiran and then by German chemist Justus von Liebig  11  1858 Hadrosaurus foulki Plate XIII from Cretaceous Reptiles of the United States  showing various Hadrosaurus teeth  top  and vertebrae  bottom right   The teeth on the bottom left belonged to Astrodon  Hadrosaurus was a dubious genus of a hadrosaurid dinosaur that lived near what is now the coast of New Jersey in the late Cretaceous  around 80 million years ago  It was likely bipedal for the purposes of running  but could use its forelegs to support itself while grazing  Like all hadrosaurids  Hadrosaurus was herbivorous  Its teeth suggest it ate twigs and leaves  In the summer of 1858 while vacationing in Haddonfield  New Jersey  William Parker Foulke discovered the world s first nearly complete skeleton of any species of dinosaur  the Hadrosaurus  named by Joseph Leidy   an event that would rock the scientific world and forever change our view of natural history  To this day  Haddonfield  New Jersey is considered to be  ground zero  of dinosaur paleontology  12  1859 Midway Atoll Midway Atoll  better known as Midway Island or collectively as the Midway islands  is a territory of the United States and a part of the wider United States Minor Outlying Islands that is located in the North Pacific Ocean near the northwestern end of the Hawaiian Islands  As a 2 4 square mile  6 2 km   atoll  Midway Atoll is one third of the way between Honolulu  Hawaii and Tokyo  Japan  approximately 140 nautical miles  259 kilometers  east of the International Date Line  about 2 800 nautical miles  5 200 kilometers  west of San Francisco  California  and 2 200 nautical miles  4 100 kilometers  east of Tokyo  Japan  Midway Atoll consists of a ring shaped barrier reef and several sand islets  The two significant pieces of land  Sand Island and Eastern Island  provide habitat for millions of seabirds  Because of the importance of marine and biological environment  Midway Atoll is an insular area known as the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge that is administered and managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service  an agency of the United States Department of Interior  Midway Atoll is perhaps best known as the site of the Battle of Midway  fought in World War II on June 4 6  1942 and the decisive turning point of the Pacific War when the United States Navy defeated an attack by the Empire of Japan  First known as  Middlebrooks Islands   Midway Atoll was discovered by U S  Captain N C  Brooks aboard his ship  Gambia  on July 8  1859  8  13  1859 Petroleum jelly Petroleum jelly  petrolatum or soft paraffin is a semi solid mixture of hydrocarbons originally promoted as a topical ointment for its healing properties  The raw material for petroleum jelly was discovered in 1859 by Robert Chesebrough  a chemist from New York  In 1870  this product was branded as Vaseline Petroleum Jelly  14  1873 Chemical potential In thermodynamics  physics  and chemistry  chemical potential  symbolized by    is a term introduced by the American engineer  chemist  and mathematical physicist Josiah Gibbs in his 1873 paper A Method of Geometrical Representation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces   15  1875 Red Delicious Bushels of Red Delicious apples  The Red Delicious is a clone of apple cultigen  now comprising more than 50 cultivars  The Red Delicious apple was disvoered in 1875 by Jesse Hiatt on his farm in Peru  Iowa  Believing that the seedling was nothing more than nuisance  After chopping down the tree three times  Hiatt decided to let the tree grow and eventually  it produced an unknown and new harvest of red apples  Hiatt would eventually sell the rights to this type of apple to the Stark Brothers Nurseries and Orchards who renamed it the Red Delicious  16  1877 Deimos Deimos is the smaller and outer of Mars  two moons  It was discovered by Asaph Hall in 1877  17  1877 Phobos Phobos is the larger and closer of Mars  two small moons  It was discovered by Asaph Hall in 1877  18  1888 Cliff Palace Cliff Palace at Mesa Verde National Park  Colorado  The Cliff Palace is the largest cliff dwelling in North America  The structure built by the Ancient Pueblo Peoples is located in Mesa Verde National Park in their former homeland region  The cliff dwelling and park are in the southwestern corner of Colorado  in the Southwestern United States  The ancient ruins of Cliff Palace were co discovered during a snowstorm in December 1888 by Richard Wetherill and Charlie Mason who were searching for stray cattle on Chapin Mesa  19  1889 Torosaurus Torosaurus was a herbivorous dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous Period about 70 million years ago in what is now North America  Torosaurus had an enormous head that measured 8 feet  2 5 m  in length  Its skull is one of the largest know up to date  no other land animal has ever had a skull larger than Torosaurus  Torosaurus frill made up about one half the total skull length  The first fossils of Torosaurus were discovered in 1889  in Wyoming by John Bell Hatcher  The American paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh would later name the specimen Torosaurus latus  in recognition of the bull like size of its skull and its large eyebrow horns  Ever since  the specimen has been in display at the Peabody Museum in New Heaven  Connecticut  20  1891 Thescelosaurus Charles Gilmore s reconstruction of Thescelosaurus in 1915  Thescelosaurus was a bipedal dinosaur with a sturdy build  small wide hands  and a long pointed snout from the Late Cretaceous Period  approximately 65 5 million years ago  As a herbivore  Thescelosaurus was not a tall dinosaur and probably browsed the ground selectively to find food  Its leg structure and proportionally heavy build suggests that it was not a fast runner like other dinosaurs  Thie first fossils of Thescelosaurus were co discovered in 1891 by John Bell Hatcher and William H  Utterback  in Wyoming  However  this discovery remained stored until Charles W  Gilmore named the dinosaur in 1913  21  1892 Amalthea Amalthea is the third moon of Jupiter in order of distance from the planet  It was discovered on September 9  1892  by Edward Emerson Barnard  22  1899 Phoebe Phoebe is an irregular satellite of Saturn  It was discovered by William Henry Pickering on March 17  1899 from photographic plates that had been taken starting on August 16  1898 at Arequipa  Peru by DeLisle Stewart  23   edit  Twentieth century 1902 Tyrannosaurus The first sketch of a Tyrannosaurus skeleton in relation to a human skeleton ever published  Tyrannosaurus  a bipedal carnivore  is a genus of theropod dinosaur  The species Tyrannosaurus rex  commonly abbreviated to T  rex  is a fixture in popular culture  It lived throughout what is now western North America  with a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids  Fossils are found in a variety of rock formations dating to the last two million years of the Cretaceous Period  67 to 65 5 million years ago  It was among the last non avian dinosaurs to exist prior to the Cretaceous Tertiary extinction event  In 1902  the first skeleton of Tyrannosaurus was discovered in Hell Creek  Montana by American paleontologist Barnum Brown  In 1908  Brown discovered a better preserved skeleton of Tyrannosaurus  24  1908 Seyfert galaxies Seyfert galaxies are a class of galaxies with nuclei that produce spectral line emission from highly ionized gas  named after Carl Keenan Seyfert  the astronomer who first identified the class in 1943 although they were first discovered by Edward A  Fath in 1908 while he was at the Lick Observatory  25  1909 Burgess shale Charles Doolittle Walcott seen excavating the Burgess shale  near Field  British Columbia  with his wife Helen and son Sidney  in the quarry which now bears his name  The formation of Burgess shale   located in the Canadian Rockies of British Columbia   is one of the world s most celebrated fossil fields  26  and the best of its kind  27  It is famous for the exceptional preservation of the soft parts of its fossils  It is 505 million years  Middle Cambrian  old  28  one of the earliest soft parts fossil beds  The rock unit is a black shale  and crops out at a number of localities near the town of Field  British Columbia in the Yoho National Park  The Burgess Shale was discovered by American palaeontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott in 1909  towards the end of the season s fieldwork  29  He returned in 1910 with his sons  establishing a quarry on the flanks of Fossil Ridge  The significance of soft bodied preservation  and the range of organisms he recognized as new to science  led him to return to the quarry almost every year until 1924  At this point  aged 74  he had amassed over 65 000 specimens  Describing the fossils was a vast task  pursued by Walcott until his death in 1927  29  1910 Propane Propane is a three carbon alkane  normally a gas  but compressible to a transportable liquid  It is derived from other petroleum products during oil or natural gas processing  It is commonly used as a fuel for engines  barbecues  portable stoves  and residential central heating  Propane was first identified as a volatile component in gasoline by Dr  Walter O  Snelling of the U S  Bureau of Mines in 1910  30  1912 Smoking cancer link Dr  Isaac Adler was the first to strongly suggest that lung cancer is related to smoking in 1912  31  1914 Sinope Sinope is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter discovered by Seth Barnes Nicholson at Lick Observatory in 1914  32  1915 Zener diodes A Zener diode is a type of diode that permits current in the forward direction like a normal diode  but also in the reverse direction if the voltage is larger than the breakdown voltage known as  Zener knee voltage  or  Zener voltage   The device was named after Clarence Zener  who discovered this electrical property  1916 Barnard s Star Barnard s Star is a very low mass red dwarf star  At a distance of about 1 8 parsecs from the Solar System  or just under six light years  Barnard s Star is the nearest known star in the constellation Ophiuchus  and the fourth closest known individual star to the Sun  after the three components of the Alpha Centauri system  In 1916  Barnard s Star was discovered by American astronomer Edward Emerson Barnard  whom the star was named after  33  1916 Covalent bonding The idea of covalent bonding can be traced several years to Gilbert N  Lewis  who in 1916 described the sharing of electron pairs between atoms  He introduced the so called Lewis notation or electron dot notation or The Lewis Dot Structure in which valence electrons are represented as dots around the atomic symbols  34  1916 Heparin Heparin  a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan  is widely used as an injectable anticoagulant and has the highest negative charge density of any known biological molecule  It can also be used to form an inner anticoagulant surface on various experimental and medical devices such as test tubes and renal dialysis machines  It was discovered by Jay McLean and William Henry Howell in 1916  35  1917 Vitamin A Vitamin A  a bi polar molecule formed with bi polar covalent bonds between carbon and hydrogen  is linked to a family of similarly shaped molecules  the retinoids  which complete the remainder of the vitamin sequence  Its important part is the retinyl group  which can be found in several forms  In foods of animal origin  the major form of vitamin A is an ester  primarily retinyl palmitate  which is converted to an alcohol in the small intestine  Vitamin A can also exist as an aldehyde  or as an acid  The discovery of vitamin A stemmed from research dating back to 1906  indicating that factors other than carbohydrates  proteins  and fats were necessary to keep cattle healthy  By 1917 one of these substances was independently discovered by Elmer McCollum at the University of Wisconsin Madison  36  and Lafayette Mendel and Thomas Osborne at Yale University  1923 Oviraptor Oviraptor is a genus of small Mongolian theropod dinosaur that lived during the late Campanian stage about 75 million years ago  In 1923  Roy Chapman Andrews discovered the first and so far the only fossils of Oviraptor to ever be found at the Djadochta Formation in Inner Mongolia  This species of dinosaur was named and described by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1924  37  1924 Uncle Sam Diamond Uncle Sam is a 40 23 carat white diamond  the largest diamond ever found in North America  Discovered in 1924 at the Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas  the diamond was named after its discoverer  Wesley Oley Basham  who went by the nickname  Uncle Sam   Over the years  the Uncle Sam diamond was cut twice with the second cutting resulting in a 12 42 carat  emerald cut gem  38  1925 Cepheid variables Extragalactic astronomy is the branch of astronomy concerned with objects outside the Milky Way Galaxy  In other words  it is the study of all astronomical objects which are not covered by galactic astronomy  It was started by Edwin Hubble when  in 1925  he discovered the existence of Cepheid variables in the Andromeda Galaxy  This discovery proved the existence of a galaxy over one million light years away and thus extragalactic astronomy was created  39  40  1927 Electron diffraction Electron diffraction is a collective scattering phenomenon with electrons being scattered by atoms in a regular crystal array  This can be understood in analogy to the Huygens principle for the diffraction of light  The incoming plane electron wave interacts with the atoms  and secondary waves are generated which interfere with each other  In 1927  two Americans named Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer had proven de Broglie s theory by discovering electron diffraction  This confirmation of the wavelike nature of an electron was discovered independently of Englishman George Paget Thomson  41  1928 Jones Diamond The Jones Diamond is a bluish white diamond weighing 34 48 carats  6 896 g   measuring 5 8 of an inch  15 8 mm  across  and possessing 12 diamond shaped faces  It is considered to be the largest alluvial diamond from North America  The Jones Diamond was discovered by William P   Punch  Jones and his father Grover while pitching horseshoes in 1928  They thought the stone was a piece of quartz which was common in the area  Keeping it in a cigar box in their tool shed for 14 years  the Jones s sent the gem to the geology department at Virginia Polytechnic Institute in 1942 where they were informed that it was an alluvial diamond and not a quartz crytal  The diamond was then sent to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D C  for safekeeping until 1964  when it returned to the Jones family who kept it for another 20 years in a safe deposit box at their local bank in Virginia  In 1984  the Jones family finally sold the diamond at Sotheby s auction in New York City to a private collector of jewelry  42  1930 Pluto Clyde William Tombaugh  the American astronomer who discovered Pluto in 1930  Following the discovery of the planet Neptune in 1846  there was considerable speculation that another planet might exist beyond its orbit  The search began in the mid 19th century but culminated at the start of the 20th century with a quest for Planet X  Percival Lowell proposed the Planet X hypothesis to explain apparent discrepancies in the orbits of the gas giants  particularly Uranus and Neptune  speculating that the gravity of a large unseen planet could have perturbed Uranus enough to account for the irregularities  The discovery of Pluto by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 initially appeared to validate Lowell s hypothesis  and Pluto was considered the ninth planet until 2006  43  1931 Heavy hydrogen Heavy hydrogen is a stable isotope of hydrogen with a natural abundance in the oceans of Earth of approximately one atom in 6500 of hydrogen   154 PPM   It was first predicted in 1926 by Walter Russell and later discovered in 1931 by Harold Urey  44  1931 Cosmic radio waves Radio astronomy is a subfield of astronomy that studies celestial objects at radio frequencies  While trying to track down a source of electrical interference on telephone transmissions  Karl Guthe Jansky of Bell Telephone Laboratories discovered radio waves emanating from stars in outer space while investigating static that interfered with short wave transatlantic voice transmissions  Thus  the field of radio astronomy was born  45  1932 Positrons The existence of positrons was first postulated in 1928 by Paul Dirac as a consequence of the Dirac equation and later discovered in 1932 by Carl D  Anderson  who gave the positron its name  46  1932 Homeostasis Homeostasis is the property of a system  either open or closed  that regulates its internal environment so as to maintain a stable  constant condition  It was first proposed and coined by Walter Bradford Cannon  a former professor and chairman of the Department of Physiology at Harvard Medical School  and popularized it in his book The Wisdom of the Body  47  1933 Heavy water Harold Urey discovered the isotope deuterium in 1931 and was later able to concentrate it in water  Urey s mentor Gilbert Newton Lewis isolated the first sample of pure heavy water by electrolysis in 1933  48  1933 Polyvinylidene chloride Polyvinylidene chloride is a polymer derived from vinylidene chloride  Its use can be found in water based coating  the production of household items and industrial products  Ralph Wiley  a Dow Chemical lab worker  accidentally discovered polyvinylidene chloride in 1933  49  1936 Elliptical galaxies An elliptical galaxy is a galaxy having an approximately elliptical shape and a smooth  nearly featureless brightness profile  They range in shape from nearly spherical to highly flattened and in size from hundreds of millions to over one trillion stars  It was originally described by Edwin Hubble in his 1936 work  The Realm of the Nebulae   50  1936 Muons The muon is an elementary particle similar to the electron  with negative electric charge and a spin of 1 2  It was discovered by Carl D  Anderson and Seth Henry Neddermeyer in 1936 while they studied cosmic radiation  51  1936 Vitamin E Tocopherol  a class of chemical compounds of which many have vitamin E activity  describes a series of organic compounds consisting of various methylated phenols  During feeding experiments with rats Herbert McLean Evans concluded in 1922 that besides vitamins B and C  an unknown vitamin existed  Although every other nutrition was present  the rats were not fertile  This condition could be changed by additional feeding with wheat germ  It took several years until 1936 when the substance was isolated from wheat germ and the formula C29H50O2 was determined by Herbert McLean Evans and K S  Bishop  The structure was determined shortly thereafter in 1938  52  1936 Sodium thiopental Sodium thiopental  better known as Sodium Pentothal  thiopentone sodium  or trapanal  is a rapid onset short acting barbiturate  It was discovered in the early 1936 by Ernest H  Volwiler and Donalee L  Tabern while working for Abbott Laboratories  53  1937 Niacin Niacin  also known as vitamin B3  is a water soluble vitamin which prevents the deficiency disease pellagra  Niacin was extracted from livers by Conrad Elvehjem who later discovered the active ingredient  then referred to as the  pellagra preventing factor  and the  anti blacktongue factor    54  1937 Electron capture Electron capture is a decay mode for isotopes that will occur when there are too many protons in the nucleus of an atom and insufficient energy to emit a positron  However  it continues to be a viable decay mode for radioactive isotopes that can decay by positron emission  K electron capture was discovered by Luis Alvarez  who demonstrated it in 1937 and reported it in The Physical Review in April 1938  55  1938 Fluropolymers A fluoropolymer is a fluorocarbon based polymer with multiple strong carbon fluorine bonds  It is characterized by a high resistance to solvents  acids  and bases  Fluoropolymers were discovered in 1938 by Dr  Roy Plunkett when he accidentally polymerized tetrafluoroethylene to form polytetrafluoroethylene  56  1938 Animal echolocation Echolocation  also called biosonar  is the biological sonar used by several animals such as dolphins  shrews  bats  and whales  The term was coined by Donald Griffin and Robert Galambos  who discovered its use by bats in 1938  57  1938 Carme Carme is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter  It was discovered by Seth Barnes Nicholson at Mount Wilson Observatory in California in July 1938  58  1938 Lysithea Lysithea is a prograde irregular satellite of Jupiter  It was discovered by Seth Barnes Nicholson in 1938 at Mount Wilson Observatory  59  1940 Plutonium Plutonium is a synthetic transuranic radioactive chemical element with the chemical symbol Pu and atomic number 94  It is an actinide metal of silvery white appearance that tarnishes when exposed to air  forming a dull coating when oxidized  Plutonium was co discovered by Glenn T  Seaborg  A C  Wahl  and J W  Kennedy in 1940  60  1942 Cyanoacrylate Cyanoacrylates are a class of fast acting adhesives and glues  Better known under the brand name  Super Glue   cyanoacrylates are used to assemble prototype electronics  see wire wrap   flying model aircraft  and as retention dressings for nuts and bolts  Their effectiveness in bonding metal and general versatility have also made them popular for use in simple woodworking  industrial binding  and appliance repair  The history of cyanoacrylates is one of accidental discovery when researchers under Dr  Harry Coover conducted experiments on adhesive chemicals in order to devise a clear plastic that could be used for precision gunsights for soldiers fighting in World War II  Failing in their experimentations  the practical usefulness of cyanoarcrylates did not materialize until much later when in 1951  Coover  who was then working at Eastman Kodak  came to the realization that the sticky adhesives had unique properties in that they required no heat or pressure to permanently bond two items together  61  62  In light of his invention of  Super Glue   Coover filed U S  patent  2 768 109 on June 2  1954 and it was issued to him on October 23  1956  63  1943 Streptomycin Streptomycin is an antibiotic drug  the first of a class of drugs called aminoglycosides to be discovered  and was the first antibiotic remedy for tuberculosis  Streptomycin cannot be given orally as it must be administered by regular intramuscular injection  In 1943  Albert Schatz discovered Streptomycin  64  1944 Americium Americium is a synthetic element that has the symbol Am and atomic number 95  A radioactive metallic element  americium is an actinide that is used in commercial ionization chamber smoke detectors  as well as in neutron sources and industrial gauges  Americium was co discovered by Glenn T  Seaborg  Ralph James  L  Morgan  and Albert Ghiorso during their work on the Manhattan Project in 1944  65  1944 Curium Curium is a synthetic chemical element

first expedition brought no success  A second expedition was mounted in late May 1989  and on June 8  1989  after combing an area of some 200 square miles  520 km2   Ballard and his team finally found Bismarck s remains  The wreck lies in the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean some 600 miles  970 km  west of Brest  France at a depth of 4 790 meters  15 700 ft   135  1990 Strawn Wagner Diamond The Strawn Wagner Diamond The Strawn Wagner Diamond is a rare 3 03 carat diamond that is certified by the American Gem Society  AGS  as the world s most perfect diamond in terms of its cut and the highest grade possible  the  Triple Zero   The Strawn Wagner Diamond was discovered in 1990 at the Crater of Diamonds State Park by Shirley Strawn of Murfreesboro  Arkansas  38  1993 Comet Shoemaker Levy 9 Comet Shoemaker Levy 9 was a comet that broke apart and collided with Jupiter in July 1994  providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of solar system objects  The collision provided new information about Jupiter and highlighted its role in reducing space debris in the inner solar system  Comet Shoemaker Levy 9 was co discovered photographically by the husband and wife scientific team of Carolyn S  Shoemaker and Eugene M  Shoemaker along with Canadian born astronomer David H  Levy on March 24  1993  using the 0 46 m  18 in   Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory in California  Its discovery was a serendipitous product of their continuing search for  near Earth objects   and the  9  indicates that it was the ninth short period comet  period less than 200 years  discovered by this team  136  1995 Top quark The top quark is the third generation up type quark with a charge of   2 3 e  It was discovered in 1995 by the CDF and D0 experiments at Fermilab and is the most massive of known elementary particles  137  1995 Comet Hale Bopp Comet Hale Bopp was arguably the most widely observed comet of the 20th century  and one of the brightest seen for many decades and it was visible to the naked eye for a record 18 months when it passed near planet Earth  Hale Bopp was discovered by Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp on July 23  1995 at a great distance from the Sun  raising expectations that the comet would brighten considerably by the time it passed close to Earth  Although predicting the brightness of comets with any degree of accuracy is very difficult  Hale Bopp met or exceeded most predictions when it passed perihelion on April 1  1997  138  1998 USS Yorktown  CV 5  wreckage The third USS Yorktown in the United States Navy  lead ship of the Yorktown class of aircraft carriers  was laid down on May 21  1934 at Newport News  Virginia  by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company  Yorktown was launched on April 4  1936  sponsored by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt  and commissioned at Norfolk  Virginia  on September 30  1937 with Captain Ernest D  McWhorter in command  Yorktown was hit by air launched torpedoes during the Battle of Midway on June 6  1942  Hiry   the sole surviving Japanese aircraft carrier  wasted little time in counter attacking  The first wave of Japanese dive bombers badly damaged Yorktown with three bomb hits that snuffed out her boilers  immobilizing her  yet her damage control teams patched her up so effectively that the second wave s torpedo bombers mistook her for an undamaged carrier  Despite Japanese hopes to even the odds by eliminating two carriers with two strikes  Yorktown absorbed both Japanese attacks  the second wave mistakenly believing Yorktown had already been sunk and they were attacking Enterprise  After two torpedo hits  Yorktown lost power and developed a 26  list to port  which put her out of action and forced Admiral Frank J  Fletcher to move his command staff to the heavy cruiser Astoria  The second attempt at salvage  however  would never be made  Throughout the night of June 6 and into the morning of June 7  Yorktown remained stubbornly afloat  By 0530 on June 7  however  the men in the ships nearby noted that the carrier s list was rapidly increasing to port  At 0701  the ship turned over on her port side and sank in 3 000 fathoms  5 500 m  of water  her battle flags still flying  On May 19  1998  the wreck of the Yorktown was discovered by Dr  Robert D  Ballard  American oceanographer and discoverer of the wreck of the RMS Titanic  The wreck of the Yorktown was found 3 miles  4 8 km  beneath the surface and was photographed  139  1998 Embryonic stem cell lines A breakthrough in human embryonic stem cell research came in November 1998 when a group led by Dr  James Thomson  140  at the University of Wisconsin Madison first discovered a technique in order to isolate and grow cells which derived from human blastocysts  could one day lead to major medical advancements in organ transplantation as well as gene therapy and treatment of maladies such as paralysis  diabetes  cancer  and AIDS   edit  Twenty first century 2001 Interstellar vinyl alcohol Between May and June 2001  astronomers A  J  Apponi and Barry Turner co discovered vinyl alcohol in the molecular cloud Sagittarius B using the National Science Foundation s 12 meter radio telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory  141  2003 Sedna 90377 Sedna is a trans Neptunian object and a likely dwarf planet  For most of its orbit Sedna is farther from the Sun than any other known dwarf planet candidate  In 2003  Sedna was co discovered by Michael E  Brown  Chad Trujillo  and David Rabinowitz using the Samuel Oschin Telescope at Palomar Observatory  142  2003 Psamathe Psamathe  also known as Neptune X  is a retrograde irregular satellite of Neptune  Psamathe was co discovered by Scott S  Sheppard and David C  Jewitt in 2003  143  2003 Mab Mab is an inner satellite of Uranus  It was co discovered by Mark R  Showalter and Jack J  Lissauer in 2003 using the Hubble Space Telescope  144  2003 Perdita Perdita is an inner satellite of Uranus  Perdita s discovery was complicated  The first photographs of Perdita were taken by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1986  but it was not recognized from the photographs for more than a decade  In 1999  the moon was noticed by Erich Karkoschka and reported  Because no further pictures could be taken to confirm its existence  it was officially demoted in 2001  However  in 2003  pictures taken by the Hubble Space Telescope managed to pick up an object where Perdita was supposed to be  finally confirming its existence  145  2003 Cupid Cupid is an inner satellite of Uranus  It was co discovered by Mark Showalter and Jack J  Lissauer in 2003 using the Hubble Space Telescope  146  2004 Orcus 90482 Orcus is a large Kuiper Belt object  KBO  with a large companion and is likely a dwarf planet  Orcus was co discovered by Chad Trujillo  Michael E  Brown  and David Rabinowitz in 2004  147  2005 Makemake Makemake  formally designated  136472  Makemake  is the third largest known dwarf planet in the Solar System and one of the two largest Kuiper belt objects  KBO   Its diameter is roughly three quarters that of Pluto  Makemake has no known satellites  which makes it unique among the largest KBOs  Makemake was first co discovered in March 2005 by American astronomers Michael E  Brown  Chad Trujillo  and David Rabinowitz at the Palomar Observatory  148  2005 Eris Artist impression of Eris and Dysnomia  Eris is the main object  Dysnomia the small grey disk just above it  The flaring object top left is the Sun  Eris  formal designation 136199 Eris  is the largest known dwarf planet in the Solar System and the ninth largest body known to orbit the Sun directly  It is approximately 2 500 kilometres in diameter and 27  more massive than the dwarf planet Pluto  Eris was discovered in 2005 at W  M  Keck Observatory by American astronomer Michael E  Brown  149  2005 Dysnomia Dysnomia  officially  136199  Eris I Dysnomia  is the only known moon of the dwarf planet Eris  In conjunction of finding Eris  American astronomer Michael E  Brown discovered Eris  satellite  Dysnomia  at W  M  Keck Observatory in 2005  150  2005 Hydra Hydra is the outer most natural satellite of Pluto  It was discovered along with Nix in June 2005 by the Hubble Space Telescope s Pluto Companion Search Team  which is composed of Hal A  Weaver  Alan Stern  Max J  Mutchler  Andrew J  Steffl  Marc W  Buie  William J  Merline  John R  Spencer  Eliot F  Young  and Leslie A  Young  151  2005 Nix Nix is a natural satellite of Pluto  It was discovered along with Hydra in June 2005 by the Hubble Space Telescope s Pluto Companion Search Team  composed of Hal A  Weaver  Alan Stern  Max J  Mutchler  Andrew J  Steffl  Marc W  Buie  William J  Merline  John R  Spencer  Eliot F  Young  and Leslie A  Young  151  2005 KV63 at the Valley of the Kings KV63 is the most recently opened chamber in Egypt s Valley of the Kings pharaonic necropolis  Initially believed to be a royal tomb  it is now believed to have been an ancient storage chamber for the mummification process  The 2005 discovery of KV63  located about 50 feet  15 m  away from King Tut s tomb  is credited to American Egyptologist Dr  Otto Schaden and his team from the University of Memphis  152  2007 Human genome and variation mapping The human genome is the genome of Homo sapiens  which is stored on 23 chromosome pairs  Whereas a genome sequence lists the order of every DNA base in a genome  a genome map identifies the landmarks  A genome map is less detailed than a genome sequence and aids in navigating around the genome  While working at the National Institute of Health  Craig Venter discovered a technique for rapidly identifying all of the mRNAs present in a cell  and began to use it to identify human brain genes  153  The short cDNA sequence fragments discovered by this method are called expressed sequence tags  Through his scientific research of bringing the world one step closer to personalized medicine  Craig Venter was listed on Time Magazine s 2007 and 2008 Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world  2007 Di positronium The di positronium is a molecule consisting of two atoms of positronium  It was predicted to exist in 1946 by John Archibald Wheeler and subsequently studied theoretically  but was not observed until 2007 in an experiment done by David Cassidy and Allen Mills at the University of California  Riverside  154   edit  See also United States portal Bone Wars Discovery of Pluto George Washington Carver Peanut Discoveries History of United States patent law List of African American
