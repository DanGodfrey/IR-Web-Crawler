east by the state of New York  on the southeast and south by the Atlantic Ocean  on the west by Pennsylvania and on the southwest by Delaware  New Jersey is the 4th least extensive  but the 11th most populous and the most densely populated of the 50 United States  New Jersey lies mostly within the sprawling metropolitan areas of New York City and Philadelphia  It is also the third wealthiest by 2009 2010 median household income  7  The area was inhabited by Native Americans for more than 2 800 years  with historical tribes such as the Lenape along the coast  In the early 17th century  the Dutch and the Swedes made the first European settlements  8  The British later seized control of the region  9  naming it the Province of New Jersey  It was granted as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley  1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton  At this time  it was named after the largest of the British Channel Islands  Jersey  Carteret s birthplace  10  New Jersey was the site of several decisive battles during the American Revolutionary War  In the 19th century  factories in cities such as Elizabeth  Paterson  and Trenton helped to drive the Industrial Revolution  New Jersey s position at the center of the Northeast megalopolis  between Boston and New York City to the north  and Philadelphia to the west and Baltimore  and Washington  D C  to the south  fueled its rapid growth through the suburban boom of the 1950s and beyond  The New Jersey Botanical Garden at Skylands in Ringwood State Park  Passaic and Bergen Counties  High Point Monument as seen from Lake Marcia

the Delaware Water Gap with neighboring Pennsylvania  New Jersey can be thought of as five regions  based on natural geography and population  Northeastern New Jersey  the Gateway Region  lies within the New York City Metropolitan Area  and some residents commute into the city to work  Northwestern New Jersey  or the  Skylands   is  compared to the northeast  more wooded  rural  and mountainous  The  Shore   along the Atlantic Coast in the central east and southeast  has its own natural  residential  and lifestyle characteristics owing to its location by the ocean  The Delaware Valley includes the southwestern counties of the state  which reside within the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area  The fifth region is the Pine Barrens in the interior of the southern part  Covered rather extensively by mixed pine and oak forest  it has a much lower population density than much of the rest of the state  Sunset at Cape May on the Jersey Shore  New Jersey also can be broadly divided into three geographic regions  North Jersey  Central Jersey  and South Jersey  Some New Jersey residents do not consider Central Jersey a region in its own right  but others believe it is a separate geographic and cultural area from the North and South  The federal Office of Management and Budget divides New Jersey s counties into seven Metropolitan Statistical Areas  including sixteen counties in the New York City or Philadelphia metro areas  Four counties have independent metro areas  and Warren County joins another Pennsylvania based metro area   See Metropolitan Statistical Areas of New Jersey for details   It is also at the center of the Northeast megalopolis  Additionally  the New Jersey Commerce  Economic Growth   amp  Tourism Commission divides the state into six distinct regions

South Mountain Climate As with many other geographic features  New Jersey s climate divides into regions  The south  central  and northeast parts of the state have a humid mesothermal climate  while the northwest has a humid continental climate  microthermal   with slightly cooler temperatures due to higher elevation  New Jersey receives between 2 400 and 2 800 hours of sunshine annually  12  Summers are typically hot and humid  with statewide average high temperatures of 82 88  F  28 31  C  and lows of 60 70  F  16 21  C   however  temperatures exceed 90  F  32  C  on average 25 days each

between North America and Africa gave rise to the Appalachian Mountains  Around 18 000 years ago  the Ice Age resulted in glaciers that reached New Jersey  As the glaciers retreated  they left behind Lake Passaic  as well as many rivers  swamps  and gorges  16  New Jersey was originally settled by Native Americans  with the Lenni Lenape being dominant at the time Europeans arrived  The Lenape were loosely organized groups that practiced small scale agriculture  mainly based on corn  in order to increase their largely mobile hunter gatherer society in the region surrounding the Delaware River  the lower Hudson River  and western Long Island Sound  The Lenape society was divided into matrilinear clans that were based upon common female ancestors  These clans were organized into three distinct phratries identified by their animal sign  Turtle  Turkey  and Wolf  They first encountered the Dutch in the early 17th century  and their primary relationship with the Europeans was through fur trade  Colonial era Main article  Colonial history of New Jersey New Jersey was first claimed by the Dutch  The Dutch colony of New Netherland consisted of parts of modern Middle Atlantic states  Although the European principle of land ownership was not recognized by the Lenape  Dutch West India Company policy required their colonists to purchase land which they settled  The first to do so was Michiel Pauw who established a patronship named Pavonia along the North River which eventually became the Bergen  Peter Minuit s purchase of lands along the Delaware River establish the colony of New Sweden  The entire region became a territory of England in 1664  when an English fleet under the command of Colonel Richard Nicolls sailed into what is today New York Harbor and took control of Fort Amsterdam  annexing the entire province  During the English Civil War the Channel Island of Jersey remained loyal to the Crown and gave sanctuary to the King  It was from the Royal Square in St  Helier that Charles II of England was first proclaimed King in 1649  following the execution of his father  Charles I  The North American lands were divided by Charles II  who gave his brother  the Duke of York  later King James II   the region between New England and Maryland as a proprietary colony  as opposed to a royal colony   James then granted the land between the Hudson River and the Delaware River  the land that would become New Jersey  to two friends who had remained loyal through the English Civil War  Sir George Carteret and Lord Berkeley of Stratton  The area was named the Province of New Jersey  The campuses of Rutgers University  originally chartered as Queen s College in 1766  include buildings of a variety of architectural styles  Since the state s inception  New Jersey has been characterized by ethnic and religious diversity  New England Congregationalists settled alongside Scots Presbyterians and Dutch Reformed migrants  While the majority of residents lived in towns with individual landholdings of 100 acres  40 ha   a few rich proprietors owned vast estates  English Quakers and Anglicans owned large landholdings  Unlike Plymouth Colony  Jamestown and other colonies  New Jersey was populated by a secondary wave of immigrants who came from other colonies instead of those who migrated directly from Europe  New Jersey remained agrarian and rural throughout the colonial era  and commercial farming only developed sporadically  Some townships  such as Burlington on the Delaware River and Perth Amboy  emerged as important ports for shipping to New York and Philadelphia  The colony s fertile lands and tolerant religious policy drew more settlers  and New Jersey boasted a population of 120 000 by 1775  Settlement for the first 10 years of English rule was along Hackensack River and Arthur Kill and settlers came primarily from New England  Unlike other colonies that were settled by immigrants from Europe  New Jersey was populated by a secondary wave of settlement from communities already established on the North American continent  March 18  1673  Berkeley sold his half of the colony to Quakers in England  who settled the Delaware Valley region as a Quaker colony   William Penn acted as trustee for the lands for a time   New Jersey was governed very briefly as two distinct provinces  East and West Jersey  for 28 years between 1674 and 1702  at times part of the Province of New York or Dominion of New England  In 1702  the two provinces were reunited under a royal  rather than a proprietary  governor  Edward Hyde  Lord Cornbury  became the first governor of the colony as a royal colony  Lord Cornbury was an ineffective and corrupt ruler  taking bribes and speculating on land  so in 1708 he was recalled to England  New Jersey was then ruled by the governors of New York  but this infuriated the settlers of New Jersey  who accused those governors of favoritism to New York  Judge Lewis Morris led the case for a separate governor  and was appointed governor by King George II in 1738  17  Revolutionary War era Main article  New Jersey during the American Revolution New Jersey was one of the Thirteen Colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution  The New Jersey Constitution of 1776 was passed July 2  1776  just two days before the Second Continental Congress declared American Independence from Great Britain  It was an act of the Provincial Congress  which made itself into the state Legislature  To reassure neutrals  it provided that it would become void if New Jersey reached reconciliation with Great Britain  George Washington rallying his troops at the Battle of Princeton New Jersey representatives Richard Stockton  John Witherspoon  Francis Hopkinson  John Hart  and Abraham Clark were among those who signed the United States Declaration of Independence  During the American Revolutionary War  British and American armies crossed New Jersey numerous times  and several pivotal battles took place in the state  Because of this  New Jersey today is often referred to as  The Crossroads of the Revolution   The winter quarters of the revolutionary army were established there twice by General George Washington in Morristown  which was called the military capital of the revolution  On December 25  1776  the Continental Army under George Washington crossed the Delaware River  After the crossing  he surprised and defeated the unprepared Hessian troops in the Battle of Trenton  Slightly more than a week after victory at Trenton  on January 3  1777  American forces gained an important victory by stopping General Cornwallis s charges at the Second Battle of Trenton  By evading Cornwallis s army  Washington made a surprise attack on Princeton and successfully defeated the British forces there  Emanuel Leutze s painting of Washington Crossing the Delaware became an icon of the Revolution  American forces under Washington met the forces under General Henry Clinton at the Battle of Monmouth in an indecisive engagement in June 1778  Washington attempted to take the British column by surprise  when the British army attempted to flank the Americans  the Americans retreated in disorder  The ranks were later reorganized and withstood the British charges  In the summer of 1783  the Continental Congress met in Nassau Hall at Princeton University  making Princeton the nation s capital for four months  It was there that the Continental Congress learned of the signing of the Treaty of Paris  1783   which ended the war  On December 18  1787  New Jersey became the third state to ratify the United States Constitution  which was overwhelmingly popular in New Jersey  as it prevented New York and Pennsylvania from charging and keeping tariffs on goods imported from Europe  On November 20  1789  the state became the first in the newly formed Union to ratify the Bill of Rights  The 1776 New Jersey State Constitution gave the vote to  all inhabitants  who had a certain level of wealth  This included women and blacks  but not married women  because they could not own property separately from their husbands  Both sides  in several elections  claimed that the other side had had unqualified women vote and mocked them for use of  petticoat electors   entitled to vote or not   on the other hand  both parties passed Voting Rights Acts  In 1807  the legislature passed a bill interpreting the constitution to mean universal white male suffrage  excluding paupers   This was less revolutionary than it sounds  the  constitution  was itself only an act of the legislature   18  19th century Main article  New Jersey in the 19th century On February 15  1804  New Jersey became the last northern state to abolish new slavery and enacted legislation that slowly phased out existing slavery  This led to a gradual scale down of the slave population  By the close of the Civil War about a dozen African Americans in New Jersey were still apprenticed freedmen  New Jersey voters initially refused to ratify the constitutional amendments banning slavery and granting rights to the United States  black population  In 1844  the second state constitution was ratified and brought into effect  Counties thereby became districts for the State Senate  and some realignment of boundaries  including the creation of Mercer County  immediately followed  This provision was retained in the 1947 Constitution  but was overturned by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1962 by the decision Baker v  Carr  While the Governorship was stronger than under the 1776 constitution  the constitution of 1844 created many offices that were not responsible to him  or to the people  and it gave him a three year term  but he could not succeed himself  Unlike the Revolutionary War  no Civil War battles took place within the state  However  throughout the course of the Civil War  over 80 000 from New Jersey enlisted in the Northern army to defeat the Southern Confederacy  Thomas Edison in his laboratory  West Orange  New Jersey  1901 New Jersey was one of the few Northern states  the others being Delaware and Kentucky  to select a candidate other than Abraham Lincoln twice in national elections  and sided with Stephen Douglas  1860  and George B  McClellan  1864  during their campaigns  McClellan later became governor  1878 81   During the Civil War  the state was led first by Republican Governor Charles Smith Olden  then by Democrat Joel Parker  In the Industrial Revolution  cities like Paterson grew and prospered  Previously  the economy had been largely agrarian  which was problematically subject to crop failures and poor soil  This caused a shift to a more industrialized economy  one based on manufactured commodities such as textiles and silk  Inventor Thomas Edison also became an important figure of the Industrial Revolution  having been granted 1 093 patents  many of which for inventions he developed while working in New Jersey  Edison s facilities  first at Menlo Park and then in West Orange  are considered perhaps the first research centers in the U S  Christie Street in Menlo Park was the first thoroughfare in the world to have electric lighting  Transportation was greatly improved as locomotion and steamboats were introduced to New Jersey  Iron mining was also a leading industry during the middle to late 19th century  Bog iron pits in the Southern New Jersey Pinelands were among the first sources of iron for the new nation  19 Mines such as Mt  Hope  Mine Hill and the Rockaway Valley Mines created a thriving industry  Mining generated the impetus for new towns and was one of the driving forces behind the need for the Morris Canal  Zinc mines were also a major industry  especially the Sterling Hill Mine  20th century Main article  New Jersey in the 20th century The Statue of Liberty and Jersey City Through both World Wars  New Jersey was a center for war production  especially in naval construction  Battleships  cruisers  and destroyers were all made in this state  In addition  Fort Dix  1917   originally called  Camp Dix    20 Camp Merritt  1917  21  and Camp Kilmer  1941  22  were all constructed to house and train American soldiers through both World Wars  New Jersey also became a principal location for defense in the Cold War  Fourteen Nike Missile stations were constructed  especially for the defense of New York City and Philadelphia  Pennsylvania  PT 109  a motor torpedo boat commanded by Lt   j g   John F  Kennedy in World War II  was built at the Elco Boatworks in Bayonne  The aircraft carrier USS Enterprise  CV 6  was briefly docked at the Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne in the 1950s before she was sent to Kearney to be scrapped  23  In 1962  the world s first nuclear powered cargo ship  the NS Savannah  was launched at Camden  New Jersey prospered through the Roaring Twenties  The first Miss America Pageant was held in 1921 in Atlantic City  the first drive in movie was shown in 1933 in Camden  and the Holland Tunnel opened in 1927  During the Great Depression of the 1930s  the state offered begging licenses to unemployed residents  24  the zeppelin airship Hindenburg crashed in flames over Lakehurst  and the SS Morro Castle beached itself near Asbury Park after going up in flames while at sea  In 1951  the New Jersey Turnpike opened  permitting fast travel by car and truck between North Jersey  and metropolitan New York  and South Jersey  and metropolitan Philadelphia   In the 1960s  race riots erupted in many of the industrial cities of North Jersey  The first race riots in New Jersey occurred in Jersey City on August 2  1964  Several others ensued in 1967  in Newark and Plainfield  Other riots followed the assassination of Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr  in April 1968  just as in the rest of the country  A riot occurred in Camden in 1971  As a result of an order from the New Jersey Supreme Court to fund schools equitably  the New Jersey legislature reluctantly passed an income tax bill in 1976  Prior to this bill  the state had no income tax  25  Demographics Historical populations Census Pop     1790 184 139   1800

product in 2010 was  487 billion  47  48  As of August 2011 update   the states unemployment rate is 9 4   49  50  Affluence Its per capita gross state product in 2008 was  54 699  2nd in the U S  and above the national per capita gross domestic product of  46 588  51  Its per capita income was the third highest in the nation with  51 358  51  The state also has the highest percentage of millionaire households  52  It is ranked 2nd in the nation by the number of places with per capita incomes above national average with 76 4   Nine of New Jersey s counties are in the wealthiest 100 of the country  Fiscal policy New Jersey has seven tax brackets for determining income tax rates  The rates range from 1 4 to 8 97   The standard sales tax rate is 7   applicable to all retail sales unless specifically exempt by law  Exemptions include most food items for at home preparation  medicines  clothing  except fur items   footwear  and disposable paper products for use in the home  Approximately 30 New Jersey municipalities are designated as Urban Enterprise Zones and shoppers are charged a 3   tax rate  half of the rate charged outside the UEZs  Sections of Elizabeth and Jersey City are examples of communities that are subject to the lower sales tax rate  New Jersey has the highest tax rate of all 50 states with residents paying a total of  68 billion in state and local taxes annually with a per capita burden of  7 816 at a rate of 12 9  of income  53  All real property located in the state is subject to property tax unless specifically exempted by statute  New Jersey does not assess an intangible personal property tax  but it does impose an inheritance tax  Federal taxation disparity New Jersey has the highest disparity of any state in the United States between what it gives to the federal government and what it receives  In fiscal year 2005  New Jersey taxpayers gave the federal government  77 billion  while only receiving  55 billion  This difference is higher than any other state and means that for every  1 New Jersey taxpayers send to Washington  the state only receives  0 61 in return  This calculation is applied correctly after making the federal government deficit neutral  as sometimes the federal government spends more than it receives  54  As of 2005 update   New Jersey has never been above 48th in rank for per capita federal spending  with a rank of 50th for the majority of that time  since 1982  while being second or third in per capita federal taxes paid to Washington  New Jersey runs into deficits frequently and has one of the highest tax burdens in the nation  55  Factors for this include the large federal tax liability which is not adjusted for New Jersey s higher cost of living and Medicaid funding formulas  As shown by the study  incomes tend to be higher in New Jersey  which puts those in higher tax brackets especially vulnerable to the alternative minimum tax  Industries Cranberry harvest

 and its carbon dioxide emissions are only 0 8  of the U S  total  Its comparatively low greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to nuclear power  According to the Energy Information Administration  nuclear power dominates New Jersey s electricity market  typically supplying more than one half of State generation  New Jersey has three nuclear power plants  including the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station  which came online in 1969 and is the oldest operating nuclear plant in the country  57  New Jersey has a strong scientific economy  New Jersey is home to major pharmaceutical firms

others are also in the top 100  Natural resources New Jersey s greatest natural resource is its location  which has made the state a crossroads of commerce  Other commercial advantages include its extensive transportation system  which puts one quarter of all United States consumers within overnight delivery range  Lake and seaside resorts such as Atlantic City have contributed to New Jersey s rank of fifth among the states in revenues from tourism  Almost half of New Jersey is wooded  The chief tree of the northern forests is the oak  A large part of the southern section is in pine  Jersey oak has been used extensively in shipbuilding  The mineral resources in New Jersey are small  The state  however  does rank high in smelting and refining minerals from other states  Some mining

New Jersey State Government Shutdown Executive The position of Governor of New Jersey has been considered one of the most powerful in the nation  Until recently the governor was the only statewide elected office in the state appointed numerous government officials  Formerly  an Acting Governor was even more powerful as he simultaneously served as President of the New Jersey State Senate  thus directing half of the legislative and all of the executive process  In 2002 and 2007  President of the State Senate Richard Codey held the position of Acting Governor for a short time  and from 2004 to 2006 Codey became a long term Acting Governor due to Jim McGreevey s resignation  A 2005 amendment to the state Constitution prevents the Senate President from becoming Acting Governor in the event of a permanent gubernatorial vacancy without giving up her or his seat in the state Senate  Chris Christie  Republican  is the Governor  The governor s mansion is Drumthwacket  located in Princeton Township  In recent years  New Jersey was one of the few states without a lieutenant governor  Republican Kim Guadagno was elected the first Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey and took office on January 19  2010  She was elected on the Republican ticket with Governor Elect Chris Christie in the November 2009 NJ gubernatorial election  The position was created as the result of a Constitutional amendment to the New Jersey State Constitution passed by the voters on November 8  2005 and effective as of January 17  2006  Legislative The New Jersey State House is topped by its golden dome in Trenton  The current version of the New Jersey State Constitution was adopted in 1947  It provides for a bicameral New Jersey Legislature  consisting of an upper house Senate of 40 members and a lower house General Assembly of 80 members  Each of the 40 legislative districts elects one State Senator and two Assembly members  Assembly members are elected for a two year term in all odd numbered years  State Senators are elected in the years ending in 1  3  and 7 and thus serve either four  or two year terms  New Jersey is one of only five states that elects its state officials in odd numbered years   The others are Kentucky  Louisiana  Mississippi  and Virginia   New Jersey holds elections for these offices every four years  in the year following each federal Presidential election year  Thus  the last year when New Jersey elected a Governor was 2009  the next gubernatorial election will occur in 2013  with future gubernatorial elections to take place in 2017  2021  2025  etc  Judicial The New Jersey Supreme Court 68  consists of a Chief Justice and six Associate Justices  All are appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of a majority of the membership of the State Senate  Justices serve an initial seven year term  after which they can be reappointed to serve until age 70  Most of the day to day work in the New Jersey courts is carried out in the Municipal Courts  where simple traffic tickets  minor criminal offenses  and small civil matters are heard  More serious criminal and civil cases are handled by the Superior Court for each county  All Superior Court judges are appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of a majority of the membership of the State Senate  Each judge serves an initial seven year term  after which he or she can be reappointed to serve until age 70  New Jersey s judiciary is unusual in that it still has separate courts of law and equity  like its neighbor Delaware but unlike most other U S  states  The New Jersey Superior Court is divided into Law and Chancery Divisions at the trial level  The Superior Court also has an Appellate Division  which functions as the state s intermediate appellate court  Superior Court judges are assigned to the Appellate Division by the Chief Justice  There is also a Tax Court  which is a court of limited jurisdiction  Tax Court judges hear appeals of tax decisions made by County Boards of Taxation  They also hear appeals on decisions made by the Director of the Division of Taxation on such matters as state income  sales and business taxes  and homestead rebates  Appeals from Tax Court decisions are heard in the Appellate Division of Superior Court  Tax Court judges are appointed by the Governor for initial terms of seven years  and upon reappointment are granted tenure until they reach the mandatory retirement age of 70  There are 12 Tax Court judgeships  Counties Further information  List of New Jersey counties New Jersey is divided into 21 counties  13 date from the colonial era  New Jersey was completely divided into counties by 1692  the present counties were created by dividing the existing ones  most recently Union County in 1857  New Jersey is the only state in the nation where elected county officials are called  Freeholders   governing each county as part of its own Board of Chosen Freeholders  The number of freeholders in each county is determined by referendum  and must consist of three  five  seven or nine members  Depending on the county  the executive and legislative functions may be performed by the Board of Chosen Freeholders or split into separate branches of government  In 16 counties  members of the Board of Chosen Freeholders perform both legislative and executive functions on a commission basis  with each Freeholder assigned responsibility for a department or group of departments  In the other 5 counties  Atlantic  Bergen  Essex  Hudson and Mercer   there is a directly elected County Executive who performs the executive functions while the Board of Chosen Freeholders retains a legislative and oversight role  In counties without an Executive  a County Administrator  or County Manager  may be hired to perform day to day administration of county functions  Municipalities New Jersey has 566 municipalities  the number was 567 before Pahaquarry Township was absorbed by Hardwick Township in 1997  Unlike states in the west and south  all New Jersey land is part of a municipality  In 2008  Governor Jon Corzine proposed cutting state aid to all towns under 10 000 people  to encourage mergers to reduce administrative costs  69  In May 2009  the Local Unit Alignment Reorganization and Consolidation Commission  LUARC  began a study of about 40 small communities in South Jersey to decide which ones might be good candidates for consolidation  70  Types of government When the types of government were devised in the 19th century  the intention was that cities would be large built up areas  with progressively smaller boroughs  towns  and villages  the rural areas in between would be relatively large townships  This is still often true  although Shrewsbury Township has been divided over the years  today it is less than a square mile  consisting only of a single housing development  Some townships   notably Brick  Hamilton  Middletown  and Toms River   have  without changing their boundaries  become large stretches of suburbia  as populous as cities  often focused around shopping centers and highways rather than traditional downtowns and main streets  Short Hills  Murray Hill  and many other locations in New Jersey are not municipalities but rather neighborhoods  with no exact boundaries  Often the cluster of houses  the traditional neighborhood  the postal district  and the Census designated place will differ  Forms of government New Jersey Municipal Government Traditional forms Borough Township City Town Village Modern Forms Walsh Act Commission 1923 Municipal Manager Faulkner Act Forms Mayor Council Council Manager Small Municipality Mayor Council Administrator Nonstandard Forms Special Charter Changing Form of Municipal Government Charter Study Commission This box  view talk edit The five types of municipality differ mostly in name  Originally  each type had its own form of government but more modern forms are available to any municipality  even though the original type is retained in its formal name  Only boroughs can  but are not required to  have the  borough form  of government  Starting in the 20th century  largely driven by reform minded goals  a series of six modern forms of government was implemented  This began with the Walsh Act  enacted in 1911 by the New Jersey Legislature  which provided for a 3  or 5 member commission elected on a non partisan basis  This was followed by the 1923 Municipal Manager Law  which offered a non partisan council  provided for a weak mayor elected by and from the members of the council  and introduced Council Manager government with an  ideally apolitical  appointed manager responsible for day to day administration of municipal affairs  The Faulkner Act  originally enacted in 1950 and substantially amended in 1981  offers four basic plans  Mayor Council  Council Manager  Small Municipality  and Mayor Council Administrator  The act provides many choices for communities with a preference for a strong executive and professional management of municipal affairs and offers great flexibility in allowing municipalities to select the characteristics of its government  the number of seats on the Council  seats selected at large  by wards  or through a combination of both  staggered or concurrent terms of office  and a mayor chosen by the Council or elected directly by voters  Most large municipalities and a majority of New Jersey s residents are governed by municipalities with Faulkner Act charters  Municipalities can also formulate their own unique form of government and operate under a Special Charter with the approval of the New Jersey Legislature  While municipalities retain their names derived from types of government  they may have changed to one of the modern forms of government  or further in the past to one of the other traditional forms  leading to municipalities with formal names quite baffling to the general public  For example  though there are four municipalities that are officially of the village type  Loch Arbour is the only one remaining with the village form of government  The other three villages Ridgefield Park  now with a Walsh Act form   Ridgewood  now with a Faulkner Act Council Manager charter  and South Orange  now operates under a Special Charter  have all migrated to other non village forms  Politics Main article  Politics of New Jersey Social attitudes and issues Socially  New Jersey is considered one of the more liberal states in the nation  Polls indicate that 60  of the population are self described as pro choice  although a majority are opposed to late trimester and Partial Birth Abortion and public funding of Abortion  71  72  In a 2009 Quinnipiac University poll  a plurality supported same sex marriage 49  to 43  opposed  73  In April 2004  New Jersey enacted a domestic partnership law  which is available to both same sex and opposite sex couples aged 62 and over  During 2006  the New Jersey Supreme Court voted 4 to 3 that state lawmakers must provide the rights and benefits of marriage to gay and lesbian couples  Moreover  effective February 19  2007  New Jersey became the third state in the U S   the

 and Assembly  48 32   both U S  Senate seats  and 8 out of the state s 13 seats in the U S  House of Representatives  The state had a Republican governor from 1994 to 2002  as Christie Todd Whitman won twice with vote percentages of 47 and 49 percent  In the 2009 gubernatorial election  Republican Chris Christie defeated incumbent Democrat Jon Corzine  Because each candidate for lieutenant governor runs on the same ticket as the party s candidate for governor  the current Governor and Lieutenant Governor are members of the Republican Party  The governor s appointments to cabinet and non cabinet positions may be from either party   The 2009 Attorney General appointee is a Democrat   In federal elections  the state leans heavily towards the Democratic Party  For many years  however  it was a Republican stronghold  having given comfortable margins of victory to the Republican candidate in the close elections of 1948  1968  and 1976  New Jersey was a crucial swing state in the elections of 1960  1968  and 1992  The last elected Republican to hold a Senate seat from New Jersey was Clifford P  Case in 1979   Nicholas F  Brady was appointed a U S  Senator by Governor Thomas Kean in 1982 and served for eight months  after Harrison A  Williams resigned the Senate seat following the Abscam investigations   The state s Democratic strongholds include Camden County  Essex County  including Newark  the state s largest city   Hudson County  including Jersey City  the state s second largest city   Mercer County  especially around Trenton and Princeton   Middlesex County  and Union County  including Elizabeth  the state s fourth largest city   The suburban northwestern and southeastern counties of the state are reliably Republican  Republicans have support along the coast in Ocean County and in the mountainous northwestern part of the state  especially Morris County  Sussex County  and Warren County  Other suburban counties  especially Bergen County and Burlington County had the majority of votes go to the Democratic Party  In the 2008 election  President Barack Obama won New Jersey with approximately fifty seven percent of the vote  compared to McCain s forty one percent  Independent candidate Ralph Nader garnered less than one percent of the vote  About one third of the state s counties are considered  swing  counties  but some go more one way than others  For example  Salem County  the same is true with Passaic County  with a highly populated Hispanic Democratic south  including Paterson  the state s third largest city  and a rural  Republican north  Other  swing  counties like Monmouth County  Somerset County  and Cape May County tend to go Republican  as they also have population in conservative areas  To be eligible to vote in a U S  election  all New Jerseyans are required to start their residency in the state 30 days prior to an election and register 29 days prior  Capital punishment On December 17  2007  Governor Jon Corzine signed into law a bill that would eliminate the death penalty in New Jersey  New Jersey is the first state to pass such legislation since Iowa and West Virginia eliminated executions in 1965
