uncertain  though Hughes claimed his birthday was Christmas Eve  A 1941 affidavit birth certificate of Hughes signed by his aunt Annette Gano Lummis and Estelle Boughton Sharp states he was born on December 24  1905  in Harris County  Texas  N 1  However  his baptismal record of October 7  1906  in the parish register of St  John s Episcopal Church  in Keokuk  Iowa  has his birth listed as September 24  1905  without reference to the place of birth  N 2  His parents were Allene Stone Gano  a descendant of Owen Tudor  second husband of Catherine of Valois  Dowager Queen of England  3  4  and Howard R  Hughes  Sr  from Missouri of English descent 5   who patented the two cone roller bit  which allowed rotary drilling for petroleum in previously inaccessible places  Howard R  Hughes  Sr  made the shrewd and lucrative decision to commercialize the invention by leasing the bits instead of selling them  and founded the Hughes Tool Company in 1909  Showing great aptitude in engineering at an early age  Hughes built Houston s first radio transmitter when he was 11 years old  6  At 12  he was photographed in the local newspaper as being the first boy in Houston to have a  motorized  bicycle  which he had built himself from parts taken from his father s steam engine  7  He was an indifferent student with a liking for mathematics  flying  and things mechanical  taking his first flying lesson at 14 and later auditing math and aeronautical engineering courses at Caltech  6  7  Allene Hughes died in March 1922 from complications of an ectopic pregnancy  In January 1924  Howard Hughes Sr  died of a heart attack  Their deaths apparently inspired Hughes to include the creation of a medical research laboratory in his will that he signed in 1925  at age 19  Because Howard Sr  s will had not been updated since Allene s death  Hughes inherited 75 percent of the family fortune  8  On his 19th birthday  Hughes was declared an emancipated minor  enabling him to take full control of his legacy  9  Hughes was an outstanding and enthusiastic golfer from a young age  often scoring near par figures  and held a handicap of three during his twenties  He played frequently with top players  including Gene Sarazen  10  Hughes rarely played competitively  and gradually gave up his interest in the sport  Hughes dropped out of Rice University shortly after his father s death  On June 1  1925  he married Ella Botts Rice  1925 1929   daughter of David Rice and Martha Lawson Botts of Houston  Texas  They moved to Los Angeles  where he hoped to make a name for himself making movies   edit  Hollywood years This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   March 2010  His first two films  Everybody s Acting  1927  and Two Arabian Knights  1928   were financial successes  the latter winning the first Academy Award for Best Director of a Comedy Picture  The Racket  1928  and The Front Page  1931  were also nominated for Academy Awards  Hughes spent US 3 8 million to make the flying film Hell s Angels  1930   He produced another hit  Scarface  1932   a production delayed by censors  concern over its violence  The Outlaw  1943   completed in 1941  which featured Jane Russell  also received considerable attention from industry censors  this time owing to Russell s revealing costumes  Hughes designed a special bra for his leading lady  although Russell decided against wearing the bra because of a mediocre fit  Hughes  wife returned to Houston in 1929 and filed for divorce  Hughes dated many famous women  including Billie Dove  Bette Davis  Ava Gardner  Olivia de Havilland  Katharine Hepburn  Ginger Rogers and Gene Tierney  He also proposed to Joan Fontaine several times  according to her autobiography No Bed of Roses  Bessie Love was a mistress during his first marriage  Jean Harlow accompanied him to the premiere of Hell s Angels  but Noah Dietrich wrote many years later that the relationship was strictly professional Hughes personally disliked Harlow  In his 1971 book  Howard  The Amazing Mr  Hughes  Dietrich said that Hughes genuinely liked and respected Jane Russell but never sought romantic involvement with her  According to Russell s autobiography  however  Hughes once tried to bed her after a party  Russell  who was married at the time  refused him and Hughes promised it would never happen again  The two maintained a professional and private friendship for many years  Hughes remained good friends with Tierney who was quoted after his failed attempts to seduce her  I don t think Howard could love anything that did not have a motor in it   Later  when Tierney s daughter Daria was born deaf and blind and with a severe learning disability  due to Tierney s being exposed to rubella during her pregnancy  Hughes saw to it that Daria received the best medical care and paid all expenses  11  On July 11  1936  Hughes struck and killed a pedestrian named Gabriel S  Meyer with his car  at the corner of 3rd Street and Lorraine in Los Angeles  12  Although Hughes was certified as sober at the hospital to which he was taken after the accident  an attending doctor made a note that Hughes had been drinking  A witness to the accident told police that Hughes was driving erratically and too fast  and that Meyer had been standing in the safety zone of a streetcar stop  Hughes was booked on suspicion of negligent homicide and held overnight in jail until his attorney  Neil McCarthy  obtained a writ of habeas corpus for his release pending a coroner s inquest  13  14  By the time of the coroner s inquiry  however  the witness had changed his story and claimed that Meyer had moved directly in front of Hughes s car  Nancy Bayly  Watts   who was in the car with Hughes at the time of the accident  corroborates this version  On July 16  1936  Hughes was held blameless by a coroner s jury at the inquest into Meyer s death  15  Hughes told reporters outside the inquiry   I was driving slowly and a man stepped out of the darkness in front of me   On January 12  1957  Hughes married actress Jean Peters  The couple met in the 1940s  before Peters became a film actress  16  They had a highly publicized romance in 1947 and there was talk of marriage  but she said she could not combine it with her career  17  It was later claimed that Peters was  the only woman  Hughes  ever loved   18  and he reportedly had his security officers follow her everywhere even when they were not in a relationship  This was confirmed by actor Max Showalter  who became a close friend of Peters during shooting of Niagara  1953   19  Showalter told in an interview that because he frequently met with Peters  Hughes  men threatened to ruin his career if he did not leave her alone  19   edit  Aviation Hughes was a lifelong aircraft enthusiast and pilot  At Rogers Airport in Los Angeles  he learned to fly from pioneer aviators  including Moye Stephens  He set many world records and commissioned the construction of custom aircraft to be built for himself while heading Hughes Aircraft at the airport in Glendale  Operating from there  the most technologically important aircraft he commissioned was the Hughes H 1 Racer  On September 13  1935  Hughes  flying the H 1  set the landplane airspeed record of 352 mph  566 km h  over his test course near Santa Ana  California  Giuseppe Motta reached 362 mph in 1929 and George Stainforth reached 407 5 mph in 1931  both in seaplanes   A year and a half later  on January 19  1937  flying a redesigned H 1 Racer featuring extended wings  Hughes set a new transcontinental airspeed record by flying non stop from Los Angeles to Newark in 7 hours  28 minutes and 25 seconds  beating his own previous record of 9 hours  27 minutes   His average ground speed over the flight was 322 mph  518 km h   20  The H 1 Racer featured a number of design innovations  it had retractable landing gear  as Boeing Monomail had five years before  and all rivets and joints set flush into the body of the aircraft to reduce drag  The H 1 Racer is thought to have influenced the design of a number of World War II fighters such as the Mitsubishi Zero  the Focke Wulf Fw 190 and the F8F Bearcat  21  although that has never been reliably confirmed  The H 1 Racer was donated to the Smithsonian in 1975 and is on display at the National Air and Space Museum  On July 10  1938  Hughes set another record by completing a flight around the world in just 91 hours  3 days  19 hours   beating the previous record by more than four hours  Taking off from New York City  he continued to Paris  Moscow  Omsk  Yakutsk  Fairbanks  Minneapolis  and continued to New York City  For this flight he flew a Lockheed Super Electra  a twin engine transport with a four man crew  fitted with all of the latest radio and navigational equipment  Hughes wanted the flight to be a triumph of technology  illustrating that safe  long distance air travel was possible  In 1938  the William P  Hobby Airport in Houston  Texas  known at the time as Houston Municipal Airport  was re named Howard Hughes Airport  but the name was changed back after people objected to naming the airport after a living person  He also had a role in the design and financing of both the Boeing 307 Stratoliner and Lockheed L 049 Constellation  22  Hughes received many awards as an aviator  including the Harmon Trophy in 1936 and 1938  the Collier Trophy in 1938  the Octave Chanute Award in 1940  and a special Congressional Gold Medal in 1939  in recognition of the achievements of Howard Hughes in advancing the science of aviation and thus bringing great credit to his country throughout the world   According to his obituary in the New York Times  Hughes never bothered to come to Washington to pick up the Congressional Gold Medal  It was eventually mailed to him by President Harry S  Truman   edit  Hughes D 2 and XF 11 Main article  Hughes D 2 The Hughes D 2 was conceived in 1939 as a bomber with five crew members  powered by 42 cylinder Wright R 2160 Tornado engines  In the end it appeared as two person fighter reconnaissance aircraft designated the D 2A  powered by two Pratt  amp  Whitney R 2800 49 engines  The aircraft was constructed using the Duramold process  The prototype was brought to Harper s Dry Lake California in great secrecy in 1943 and first flew on June 20 of that year  23  In November 1944  the hangar containing the D 2A was hit by lightning and the aircraft was destroyed  The design of the D 2 led to the Hughes XF 11  The XF 11 was an all metal  two place reconnaissance aircraft  powered by two Pratt  amp  Whitney R 4360 31 engines  each driving a set of contra rotation propellers   edit  Near fatal crash of the Sikorsky S 43 In the spring of 1943 Hughes spent nearly a month in Las Vegas  test flying his Sikorsky S 43 amphibian aircraft  practicing touch and go landings on Lake Mead in preparation for flying the H 4 Hercules  The weather conditions at the lake during the day were ideal and he enjoyed Las Vegas at night  On May 17  1943  Hughes flew the Sikorsky from California carrying two CAA aviation inspectors  two of his employees and actress Ava Gardner  Hughes dropped Gardner off in Las Vegas and proceeded to Lake Mead to conduct qualifying tests in the S 43  The test flight did not go well  The Sikorsky crashed killing CAA inspector Ceco Cline and Hughes employee Richard Felt  Hughes suffered a severe gash on the top of his head when he hit the upper control panel and had to be rescued by one of the others on board  24  Hughes paid divers  100 000 to raise the aircraft and later spent more than  500 000 restoring the aircraft  25   edit  Near fatal crash of the XF 11 Main article  Hughes XF 11 1946 newsreel Hughes was involved in a near fatal aircraft accident on July 7  1946  while piloting the experimental U S  Army Air Force reconnaissance aircraft  the XF 11  over Los Angeles  An oil leak caused one of the contra rotating propellers to reverse pitch  causing the aircraft to yaw sharply  Hughes tried to save the craft by landing it at the Los Angeles Country Club golf course  but just seconds before he could reach his attempted destination  the XF 11 started to drop dramatically and crashed in the Beverly Hills neighborhood surrounding the country club  26  When the XF 11 finally came to a halt after destroying three houses  the fuel tanks exploded  setting fire to the aircraft and a nearby home at 808 North Whittier Drive  owned by Lt Col  Charles E  Meyer  27  Hughes managed to pull himself out of the flaming wreckage but lay beside the aircraft until he was rescued by Marine Master Sergeant William L  Durkin  who happened to be in the area visiting friends  Hughes sustained significant injuries in the crash  including a crushed collar bone  multiple cracked ribs  28  crushed chest with collapsed left lung  shifting his heart to the right side of the chest cavity  and numerous third degree burns  A oft told story said that Hughes sent a check to the Marine weekly for the remainder of his life as a sign of gratitude  However  Durkin s daughter denied that he took any money for the rescue  29  However  Hughes was proud that his mind was still working  As he lay in his hospital bed  he decided that he did not like the bed s design  He called in plant engineers to design a  tailor made  bed  equipped with hot and cold running water  built in six sections  and operated by 30 electric motors  with push button adjustments  30  The hospital bed was designed by Hughes specifically to alleviate the pain caused by moving with severe burn injuries  Despite the fact that he never had the chance to use the bed that he designed  Hughes s bed served as a prototype for the modern hospital bed in common usage today  31  Hughes s recovery was considered by his doctors to be almost miraculous  Hughes  however  believed that neither miracle nor modern medicine contributed to his recovery  Instead he vigorously believed that the natural life giving properties of fresh squeezed orange juice  Hughes would only drink orange juice that had been squeezed before his eyes  were responsible for his rapid recovery   31  Many attribute his long term addiction to opiates to his use of codeine 32  as a painkiller during his convalescence  The trademark mustache he wore afterward was used to hide a scar on his upper lip resulting from the accident  33   edit  H 4 Hercules Main article  Hughes H 4 Hercules The Hughes H 4 Hercules with Howard Hughes at the controls The Spruce Goose test plane in Brazoria County Airport in Texas Brazoria County Airport Texas  The S 43 Sikorsky test plane Hughes Aircraft Company logo until 1985  The Hughes H 4 Hercules was originally contracted by the U S  government for use during World War II to transport troops and equipment across the Atlantic as an alternative to sea going troop transport ships that were vulnerable to German U boats  However the aircraft was not completed until after the end of World War II  The concept for the Hercules was originally conceived by industrialist Henry J  Kaiser  who teamed with Hughes to build the aircraft  The Hercules was the world s largest flying boat  the largest aircraft made from wood  34  and  at 319 feet 11 inches  97 51 m   had the longest wingspan of any aircraft  the next largest wingspan is about 30 ft  9 m  shorter    The Hercules is no longer the longest or heaviest aircraft ever built  both of those titles are currently held by the Antonov An 225   The Hercules flew only once for one mile  1 6 km   and 70 feet  21m  above the water  with Hughes at the controls  on November 2  1947  The Hercules was nicknamed the  Spruce Goose  by critics  but was actually made largely from birch  not from spruce   rather than of aluminum  because the contract required the aircraft to be built of  non strategic materials   It was built in Hughes s Westchester  California facility  Howard Hughes was summoned to testify before the Senate War Investigating Committee to explain why the aircraft had not been delivered to the United States Army Air Forces during the war  but the committee disbanded without releasing a final report  The aircraft was moved to McMinnville  Oregon  where it is now part of the Evergreen Aviation Museum   edit  Hughes Aircraft Main article  Hughes Aircraft Hughes Aircraft Company  a division of Hughes Tool Company  was originally founded by Hughes in 1932  in a rented corner of a Lockheed Aircraft Corporation hangar in Burbank  California  to build the H 1 racer  During and after World War II  Hughes fashioned his company into a major defense contractor  The Hughes Helicopters division started in 1947 when helicopter manufacturer Kellett sold their latest design to Hughes for production  In 1948  Hughes created a new division of the company  the Hughes Aerospace Group  The Hughes Space and Communications Group and the Hughes Space Systems Division were later spun off in 1948 to form their own divisions and ultimately became the Hughes Space and Communications Company in 1961  In 1953  Howard Hughes gave all his stock in the Hughes Aircraft Company to the newly formed Howard Hughes Medical Institute  thereby turning the aerospace and defense contractor into a tax exempt charitable organization  The Howard Hughes Medical Institute sold Hughes Aircraft in 1985 to General Motors for US 5 2 billion  In 1997  General Motors sold Hughes Aircraft to Raytheon and in 2000  sold Hughes Space  amp  Communications to Boeing  A combination of Boeing  GM and Raytheon acquired the Hughes Research Laboratories   edit  Airlines In 1939  at the urging of Jack Frye  president of TWA  Hughes quietly purchased a majority share of TWA stock for nearly US 7 million and took control of the airline  Upon assuming ownership  Hughes was prohibited by federal law from building his own aircraft  Seeking an aircraft that would perform better than TWA s fleet of Boeing 307 Stratoliners  Hughes approached Boeing s competitor  Lockheed  Hughes had a good relationship with Lockheed since they had built the aircraft he used in his record flight around the world in 1938  Lockheed agreed to Hughes s request that the new aircraft be built in secrecy  The result was the revolutionary Constellation and TWA purchased the first 40 of the new airliners off the production line  In 1956  Hughes placed an order for 63 Convair 880s for TWA at a cost of US 400 million  Although Hughes was extremely wealthy at this time  outside creditors demanded that Hughes relinquish control of TWA in return for providing the money  In 1960  Hughes was ultimately forced out of TWA  although he owned 78  of the company and battled to regain control  Before Hughes  removal  the TWA jet financing issue precipitated the end of Hughes  relationship with Noah Dietrich  Dietrich claimed Hughes developed a plan by which Hughes Tool Company profits were to be inflated in order to sell the company for a windfall that would pay the bills for the 880s  Dietrich agreed to go to Texas to implement the plan on the condition that Hughes agreed to a capital gains arrangement he had long promised Dietrich  When Hughes balked  Dietrich resigned immediately   Noah   Dietrich quoted Hughes as replying   I cannot exist without you   Dietrich stood firm and eventually had to sue to retrieve personal possessions from his office after Hughes ordered it locked  In 1966  Hughes was forced by a U S  federal court to sell his shares in TWA because of concerns over conflict of interest between his ownership of both TWA and Hughes Aircraft  The sale of his TWA shares netted him a profit of US 547 million  During the 1970s  Hughes went back into the airline business  buying the airline Air West and renaming it Hughes Airwest   edit  RKO Main article  RKO Pictures In 1948  Hughes gained control of RKO  a struggling major Hollywood studio  by acquiring 25 percent of the outstanding stock from Floyd Odlum s Atlas Corporation  Within weeks of taking control  he dismissed three quarters of the work force and production was shut down for six months in 1949 while he undertook the investigation of the politics of all remaining studio employees  Completed pictures would be sent back for re shooting if he felt his star  especially female  was not properly presented  or if a film s anti communist politics were not sufficiently clear  In 1952  an abortive sale to a Chicago based group with no experience in the industry disrupted studio operations even further  Hughes sold the RKO theaters in 1953 as settlement of the United States v  Paramount Pictures  Inc  antitrust case  With the sale of the profitable theaters  the shaky status of the film studio became increasingly apparent  A steady stream of lawsuits from RKO s minority shareholders  charging him with financial misconduct and corporate mismanagement  became an increasing nuisance  especially because Hughes wanted to focus on his aircraft manufacturing and TWA holdings during the Korean War years  Eager to be rid of the distraction  Hughes offered to buy out all other stockholders  By the end of 1954  at a cost of nearly US 24 million  he had gained near total control of RKO  becoming the closest thing to a sole owner of a Hollywood studio seen in three decades  Six months later  Hughes sold the studio to the General Tire and Rubber Company for US 25 million  Hughes retained the rights to pictures he had personally produced  including those made at RKO  He also retained Jane Russell s contract  For Howard Hughes  this was the virtual end of his 25 year involvement in motion pictures  though he had all but destroyed a major Hollywood studio  his reputation as a financial wizard emerged unscathed  He reportedly walked away from RKO having made US 6 5 million in personal profit  35  General Tire was interested mainly in exploiting the value of the RKO library for television programming  though it made some attempts to continue producing films  After a year and a half of mixed success  General Tire shut down film production at RKO for good at the end of January 1957  The studio lots in Hollywood and Culver City were sold to Desilu Productions later that year for US 6 15 million   edit  Howard Hughes Medical Institute Main article  Howard Hughes Medical Institute In 1953  Hughes launched the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Miami  Florida  and currently located in Chevy Chase  Maryland  formed with the express goal of basic biomedical research  including trying to understand  in Hughes  words  the  genesis of life itself   Hughes  first will  which he signed in 1925 at the age of 19  stipulated that a portion of his estate should be used to create a medical institute bearing his name  36  When a major battle with the IRS loomed ahead  Hughes gave all his stock in the Hughes Aircraft Company to the institute  thereby turning the aerospace and defense contractor into a for profit entity of a fully tax exempt charity  Hughes  internist  Dr  Verne Mason  who treated Hughes after his 1946 plane crash  was chairman of the institute s medical advisory committee  37  The Howard Hughes Medical Institute s new board of trustees sold Hughes Aircraft in 1985 to General Motors for US 5 2 billion  allowing the institute to grow dramatically  The deal was the topic of a protracted legal battle between Hughes and the Internal Revenue Service  which Hughes ultimately won  After his death in 1976  many thought that the balance of Hughes  estate would go to the institute  although it was ultimately divided among his cousins and other heirs  given the lack of a will to the contrary  The HHMI was the 4th largest private organization as of 2007 38  and the largest devoted to biological and medical research  with an endowment of US 16 3 billion as of June 2007   edit  Nixon scandal Shortly before the 1960 Presidential election  Richard Nixon was harmed by revelations of a US 205 000 loan from Hughes to Nixon s brother Donald  It has long been speculated that Nixon s drive to learn what the Democrats were planning in 1972 was based in part on his belief that the Democrats knew about a later bribe that his friend Bebe Rebozo had received from Hughes after Nixon took office  In late 1971  Donald Nixon was collecting intelligence for his brother in preparation for the upcoming presidential election  One of Donald s sources was John H  Meier  39  a former business adviser of Hughes who had also worked with Democratic National Chairman Larry O Brien  However  Meier  in collaboration with former Vice President of the United States Hubert Humphrey and others  wanted to feed misinformation to the Nixon campaign  Meier told Donald that he was sure the Democrats would win the election because Larry O Brien had a great deal of information on Richard Nixon s illicit dealings with Howard Hughes that had never been released  40  41  O Brien didn t actually have any such information  but Meier wanted Nixon to think he did  Donald told his brother that O Brien was in possession of damaging Hughes information that could destroy his campaign  42  Terry Lenzner  who was the chief investigator for the Senate Watergate Committee  speculates that it was Nixon s desire to know what O Brien knew about Nixon s dealings with Hughes that may have partially motivated the Watergate break in  43   edit  Glomar Explorer Main article  USNS Glomar Explorer  T AG 193  In 1972  Hughes was approached by the CIA to help secretly recover Soviet submarine K 129 which had sunk near Hawaii four years earlier  Thus the Glomar Explorer  a special purpose salvage vessel  was born  Hughes  involvement provided the CIA with a plausible cover story  having to do with civilian marine research at extreme depths and the mining of undersea manganese nodules  In the summer of 1974  Glomar Explorer attempted to raise the Soviet vessel  44  However  during the recovery a mechanical failure in the ship s grapple caused half of the submarine to break off and fall to the ocean floor  This section is believed to have held many of the most sought after items  including its code book and nuclear missiles  Two nuclear tipped torpedoes and some cryptographic machines were recovered  along with the bodies of six Soviet submariners who were subsequently given formal burial at sea in a filmed ceremony  The operation  known as Project Azorian  but incorrectly referred to by the press as Project Jennifer   became public in February 1975 because burglars had obtained secret documents from Hughes  headquarters in June 1974  45  Though he lent his name to the operation  Hughes and his companies had no actual involvement in the project   edit  Mental illness and physical decline This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   November 2009  As early as the 1930s  Hughes displayed signs of mental illness  primarily obsessive compulsive disorder  Close friends reported that he was obsessed with the size of peas  one of his favorite foods  and used a special fork to sort them by size  While directing The Outlaw  Hughes became fixated on a minor flaw in one of Jane Russell s blouses  claiming that the fabric bunched up along a seam and gave the appearance of two nipples on each breast  He was reportedly so upset by the matter that he wrote a detailed memorandum to the crew on how to fix the problem  Richard Fleischer  who directed His Kind of Woman with Hughes as executive producer  wrote at length in his autobiography about the difficulty of dealing with the tycoon  In his book  Just Tell Me When to Cry  Fleischer explained that Hughes was fixated on trivial details and was alternately indecisive and obstinate  He also revealed that Hughes  unpredictable mood swings made him wonder if the film would ever be completed  In December 1957  Hughes told his aides that he wanted to screen some movies at a film studio near his home  Hughes stayed in the studio s darkened screening room for more than four months  never leaving  He subsisted exclusively on chocolate bars  chicken  and milk  and relieved himself in the empty bottles and containers  He was surrounded by dozens of Kleenex boxes  which he continuously stacked and re arranged  He wrote detailed memos to his aides on yellow legal pads giving them explicit instructions not to look at him  to respond when spoken to  but otherwise not speak to him  Throughout this period  Hughes sat fixated in his chair  often naked  continuously watching movies  reel after reel  day after day  When he finally emerged in the spring of 1958  his hygiene was terrible  as he had not bathed or cut his hair and nails for weeks  although this may have been due to allodynia   pain upon being touched 32    The Screening Room was located at Sunset Boulevard and Doheny Drive in Los Angeles  it was owned by Martin Nosseck and was called the  Martin Nosseck Projection Theatre    Martin Nosseck was the full time projectionist for Hughes during that time  After the screening room incident  Hughes moved into a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel  He also rented out several other rooms for his aides  his wife  and his numerous girlfriends  His erratic behavior continued  however  as he would sit naked in his bedroom with a pink hotel napkin placed over his genitals  watching movies  In one year  he spent an estimated  11 million at the hotel  In a bout of obsession with his home state  Hughes began purchasing all restaurant chains and four star hotels that had been founded within the borders of Texas  This included  if for only a short period  many unknown franchises currently out of business  Ownership of the restaurants was placed in the hands of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and all licenses were resold shortly after  Another time  he became obsessed with the 1968 film Ice Station Zebra and had it running on a continuous loop in his home  According to his aides  he watched it 150 times  46  Hughes insisted on using tissues to pick up objects  so that he could insulate himself from germs  He would also notice dust  stains or other imperfections on people s clothes and demand that they take care of it  Once one of the most visible men in America  Hughes ultimately vanished from public view  although the tabloids continued to follow rumors of his behavior and whereabouts  He was reported to be terminally ill  mentally unstable or even dead  As a result of numerous plane crashes  Hughes spent much of his later life in pain  eventually becoming severely addicted to codeine  which he injected intramuscularly  32  Hughes only had his hair cut and nails trimmed once a year  He may have been in severe chronic pain from his extensive injuries  so much so that even the act of tooth brushing was painful  so he avoided it  32  A retrospective case study suggests that Hughes  drug situation is more reminiscent of  pseudoaddiction  than true addiction  he suffered chronic pain and used narcotic medicine to control it  32  He did not inject it intravenously for immediate effect  rather  he injected it into muscle  where it would have more of an effect on pain  32  however it should be noted that codeine  when injected intravenously  leads to life threatening symptoms and is not by any means a safe route of administration  under any circumstance  47  He did not use tobacco or other drugs  and rarely consumed alcohol  32  He used diazepam to control the symptoms of withdrawal when he had not taken enough codeine  32  At the time  the field of pain management was small and there were few options for long term pain control  32  As codeine is a relatively weak narcotic  his pain was probably not controlled effectively  32  Toward the end of his life  his inner circle was largely composed of Mormons  as they were the only people he considered trustworthy  even though Hughes himself was not a member of their church  Hughes equipped this 1954 Chrysler New Yorker with an aircraft grade air filtration system which took up the entire trunk  edit  Las Vegas baron and recluse The wealthy and aging Howard Hughes  accompanied by his entourage of personal aides  began moving from one hotel to another  always taking up residence in the top floor penthouse  During the last ten years of his life  from 1966 to 1976  Hughes lived in hotels in Beverly Hills  Boston  Las Vegas  Nassau  Freeport  Vancouver  48 London  Managua  Acapulco  and others  On November 24  1966  Thanksgiving Day   49  Hughes arrived in Las Vegas by railroad car and moved into the Desert Inn  Because he refused to leave the hotel and to avoid further conflicts with the owners of the hotel  Hughes bought the Desert Inn in early 1967  The hotel s eighth floor became the nerve center of his empire and the ninth floor penthouse became Hughes  personal residence  Between 1966 and 1968  Hughes bought several other hotels casinos such as the Castaways  New Frontier  The Landmark Hotel and Casino  and the Sands  He bought the small Silver Slipper casino only to reposition the hotel s trademark neon silver slipper  visible from Hughes bedroom  which apparently had been keeping him up at night  An unusual incident marked an earlier Hughes connection to Las Vegas  during his 1954 engagement at the Last Frontier hotel in Las Vegas  flamboyant entertainer Liberace mistook Howard Hughes for his lighting director  instructing him to instantly bring up a blue light should he start to play Clair de lune  Hughes nodded in compliance  Then the hotel s entertainment director arrived to properly introduce Hughes to Liberace  50  Hughes wanted to change the image of Las Vegas to something more glamorous than it was  As Hughes wrote in a memo to an aide   I like to think of Las Vegas in terms of a well dressed man in a dinner jacket and a beautifully jeweled and furred female getting out of an expensive car   Hughes bought several local television stations  including KLAS TV   Hughes  considerable business holdings were overseen by a small panel unofficially dubbed  The Mormon Mafia  because of the many Latter day Saints on the committee  51  In addition to supervising day to day business operations and Hughes  health  they also went to great pains to satisfy Hughes  every whim  Hughes once became fond of Baskin Robbins  Banana Ripple ice cream  so his aides sought to secure a bulk shipment for him only to discover that Baskin Robbins had discontinued the flavor  They put in a request for the smallest amount the company could provide for a special order  200 gallons  750 L   and had it shipped from Los Angeles  A few days after the order arrived  Hughes announced he was tired of Banana Ripple and wanted only Chocolate Marshmallow ice cream  The Desert Inn ended up distributing free Banana Ripple ice cream to casino customers for a year  In a 1996 interview  ex Howard Hughes communicator Robert Maheu said  There is a rumor that there is still some Banana Ripple ice cream left in the freezer  It is most likely true   As an owner of several major businesses in Las Vegas  Hughes wielded enormous political and economic influence in Nevada and elsewhere  During the 1960s and early 1970s  Hughes disapproved of the underground nuclear testing taking place at the Nevada Test Site  Hughes was concerned about the risk posed by the residual nuclear radiation from the tests  and so attempted to halt the tests  When the tests finally went through despite Hughes  efforts  the detonations were powerful enough that the entire hotel in which he was staying trembled with the shock waves  52  In two separate  last ditch maneuvers  Hughes instructed his representatives to offer million dollar bribes to both presidents Lyndon B  Johnson and Richard Nixon  53  His aides  however  never offered the bribes  instead reporting to Hughes that Johnson declined the offer and they were unable to contact Nixon  citation needed  In 1971  Jean Peters filed for divorce  the two had not lived together for many years  Peters requested a lifetime alimony payment of US 70 000 a year  adjusted for inflation  and waived all claims to Hughes  estate  Hughes offered her a settlement of over a million dollars  but she declined it  Hughes did not insist upon a confidentiality agreement from Peters as a condition of the divorce  aides reported that Hughes never spoke ill of her  She refused to discuss her life with Hughes and declined several lucrative offers from publishers and biographers  Peters would state only that she had not seen Hughes for several years before their divorce and had only dealt with him by phone  Hughes was living in the Intercontinental Hotel near Lake Managua in Nicaragua  seeking privacy and security  54  when a magnitude 6 5 earthquake damaged Managua in December 1972  As a precaution  Hughes moved to the Nicaraguan National Palace and stayed there as a guest of Anastasio Somoza Debayle before leaving for Florida on a private jet the following day  55  He subsequently moved into the Penthouse at the Xanadu Princess Resort on Grand Bahama Island  which he had recently purchased  He lived almost exclusively in the penthouse of the Xanadu Beach Resort  amp  Marina for the last four years of his life  Hughes had spent a total of US 300 million on his many properties in Las Vegas  49   edit  Memoir hoax In 1972  author Clifford Irving created a media sensation when he claimed to have co written an authorized autobiography of Hughes  Hughes was such a reclusive figure that he did not immediately publicly refute Irving s statement  leading many people to believe Irving s book was a genuine autobiography  Before the book s publication  however  Hughes finally denounced Irving in a teleconference and the entire project was eventually exposed as a hoax  Irving was later convicted of fraud and spent 17 months in prison  In 1974  the Orson Welles film F for Fake included a section dealing with the entire Hughes biography hoax  In 1977  The Hoax by Clifford Irving was published in England  it is the story of these events  The 2007 film The Hoax  starring Richard Gere  is based on these events  56   edit  Death Howard Hughes s gravestone Hughes Family Gravesite at Glenwood Cemetery Hughes was reported to have died on April 5  1976  at 1 27 pm on board an aircraft owned by Robert Graf and piloted by Jeff Abrams  en route from his penthouse at the Acapulco Fairmont Princess Hotel in Mexico to The Methodist Hospital in Houston  Texas  Alternatively  other accounts indicate that he died in the flight from Freeport Grand Bahamas to Houston  57  His reclusive activities  and possibly his drug use  made him practically unrecognizable  his hair  beard  fingernails  and toenails were long  possibly due to allodynia making him averse to touch 32    his tall 6 ft 4 in  193 cm  frame now weighed barely 90 lb  41 kg   and the FBI had to resort to fingerprints to identify the body  58  Howard Hughes  alias  John T  Conover  was used upon the arrival of his body at a morgue in Houston on the day of his death  There  his body was received by Dr  Jack Titus  59  A subsequent autopsy noted kidney failure as the cause of death  Hughes was in extremely poor physical condition at the time of his death  He suffered from malnutrition  While his kidneys were damaged  his other internal organs  including his brain  were deemed perfectly healthy  32 X rays revealed five broken off hypodermic needles in the flesh of his arms  32  To inject codeine into his muscles  Hughes used glass syringes with metal needles that easily became detached  32 Phenacetin  used for chronic pain  may have been the cause of his kidney failure  32  Hughes is buried in the Glenwood Cemetery in Houston  Texas  next to his parents  60   edit  Estate Approximately three weeks after Hughes  death  a handwritten will was found on the desk of an official of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints in Salt Lake City  The so called  Mormon Will  gave US 1 56 billion to various charitable organizations  including US 625 million to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute   nearly US 470 million to the upper management in Hughes  companies and to his aides  US 156 million to first cousin William Lummis  and US 156 million split equally between his two ex wives Ella Rice and Jean Peters  A further US 156 million was endowed to a gas station owner named Melvin Dummar  Dummar told reporters that late one evening in December 1967  he found a disheveled and dirty man lying along U S  Highway 95  150 miles  240 km  north of Las Vegas  The man asked for a ride to Las Vegas  Dropping him off at the Sands Hotel  Dummar said the man told him he was Hughes  Dummar then claimed that days after Hughes s death  a  mysterious man  appeared at his gas station  leaving an envelope containing the will on his desk  Unsure if the will was genuine  and unsure of what to do  Dummar left the will at the LDS Church office  In a trial lasting seven months  the Mormon Will was eventually rejected by the Nevada court in June 1978 as a forgery  The court declared that Hughes had died intestate  Hughes  US 2 5 billion estate was eventually split in 1983 among 22 cousins  including William Lummis who serves as a trustee of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute  Dummar was largely discounted by the public as a phony and an opportunist  Jonathan Demme s film Melvin and Howard  starring Jason Robards and Paul Le Mat   was based on Dummar s tale  The U S  Supreme Court ruled that Hughes Aircraft was owned by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute  which sold it to General Motors in 1985 for US 5 2 billion  Suits brought by the states of California and Texas claiming they were owed inheritance tax were both rejected by the court  In 1984  Hughes s estate paid an undisclosed amount to Terry Moore  who claimed to have been secretly married to Hughes on a yacht in international waters off Mexico in 1949 and never divorced  Although Moore never produced proof of a marriage  her book  The Beauty and the Billionaire  became a bestseller   edit

Steenburgen   The film focuses on Melvin Dummar s claims of meeting Hughes in the Nevada desert and subsequent estate battles over his inclusion in Hughes s will  Critic Pauline Kael called the film  an almost flawless act of sympathetic imagination   61  Hughes was portrayed by Terry O Quinn in Disney s The Rocketeer  1991   substituting for the  mystery inventor   Doc Savage  in the original comic book version   Howard Hughes Documentary   broadcast in 1992 as an episode of the Time Machine documentary series  was introduced by Peter Graves  later released by A amp E Home Video  62  Before The Aviator  2004   there were several attempts to create a biopic based on the life of Hughes  For years  director actor Warren Beatty wanted to play Hughes and direct a big screen film of the mogul  It was to be released alongside Beatty s film Reds  but due to the lack of the right script  the project was abandoned  In the 1990s  producers with Touchstone Pictures wanted to do it with John Malkovich  Edward Norton  or Johnny Depp as Hughes  but  due to climbing costs  that venture was abandoned  Castle Rock Entertainment also tried to develop a biopic called Mr  Hughes with Jim Carrey starring and with Christopher Nolan directing and re writing a script originated by David Koepp and Brian De Palma  When The Aviator began production  the idea was scrapped  and Nolan went on to direct Batman Begins  Some of the details of Hughes as an adult were confirmed in A  Scott Berg s memoir of Katharine Hepburn  Kate Remembered  The Aviator  2004   directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Hughes  Nominated for 11 Academy Awards  and winning five  the acclaimed film focuses primarily on Hughes  achievements in aviation and in the movies and on the increasing handicaps imposed on him by his obsessive compulsive behavior  and ends shortly after the successful flight of the Hercules in 1947  Iron Man  directed by Jon Favreau is an adaptation of a comic book about a wealthy weapons manufacturer  Tony Stark  According to creator Stan Lee  the character s personality and playboy lifestyle were inspired by Hughes  63  explaining   Howard Hughes was one of the most colorful men of our time  He was an inventor  an adventurer  a multi billionaire  a ladies  man and finally a nutcase   64  Howard Hughes  The Real Aviator documentary was broadcast in 2004  and went on to win the Grand Festival Award for Best Documentary at the 2004 Berkeley Video  amp  Film Festival  65  The American Aviator  The Howard Hughes Story was broadcast in
