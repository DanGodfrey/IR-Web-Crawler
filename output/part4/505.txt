Beals Street in Brookline  Massachusetts on May 29  1917  7  the second son of Joseph P  Kennedy  Sr   and Rose Fitzgerald  Rose was the eldest child of John  Honey Fitz  Fitzgerald  a prominent Boston political figure who was the city s mayor and a three term member of Congress  Kennedy lived in Brookline for ten years and attended Edward Devotion School  Noble and Greenough Lower School  and the Dexter School  through 4th grade  In 1927 the family moved to 5040 Independence Avenue in Riverdale  Bronx  New York City  two years later  they moved to 294 Pondfield Road in Bronxville  New York  where Kennedy was a member of Scout Troop 2  1  Kennedy spent summers with his family at their home in Hyannisport  Massachusetts  and Christmas and Easter holidays with his family at their winter home in Palm Beach  Florida  For the 5th through 7th grade  Kennedy attended Riverdale Country School  a private school for boys  For 8th grade in September 1930  the 13 year old Kennedy attended Canterbury School in New Milford  Connecticut  In late April 1931  he required an appendectomy  after which he withdrew from Canterbury and recuperated at home  8  In September 1931 Kennedy was sent to The Choate School in Wallingford  Connecticut  for his 9th through 12th grade years  His older brother  Joe Jr   had already been at Choate for two years  a football star and leading student  Jack spent his first years at Choate in his brother s shadow  and compensated for this with rebellious behavior that attracted a coterie  Their most notorious stunt was to explode a toilet seat with a powerful firecracker  In the ensuing chapel assembly  the strict headmaster  George St  John  brandished the toilet seat and spoke of certain  muckers  who would  spit in our sea   The defiant Jack Kennedy took the cue and named his group  The Muckers Club   which included roommate and friend Kirk LeMoyne  Lem  Billings  While at Choate  Kennedy was beset by health problems that culminated in 1934 with his emergency hospitalization at Yale   New Haven Hospital  In June 1934 he was admitted to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester  Minnesota  and diagnosed with colitis  Kennedy graduated from Choate in June 1935  For the school yearbook  of which he had been business manager  Kennedy was voted the  most likely to succeed   9  In September 1935 he made his first trip abroad  with his parents and sister Kathleen  to London  with the intent of studying under Harold Laski at the London School of Economics  LSE   as his older brother Joe had done  Ill health forced his return to America in October 1935  when he enrolled late and spent six weeks at Princeton University He was then hospitalized for observation at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston  He convalesced further at the Kennedy winter home in Palm Beach  then spent the spring of 1936 working as a ranch hand on a 40 000 acres  160 km2  cattle ranch outside Benson  Arizona  10  In September 1936 Kennedy enrolled at Harvard College  where he produced that year s annual  Freshman Smoker   called by a reviewer  an elaborate entertainment  which included in its cast outstanding personalities of the radio  screen and sports world   11  He tried out for the football  golf  and swim teams and earned a spot on the varsity swim team  12  In July 1937 Kennedy sailed to France bringing his own his convertible and spent ten weeks driving through Europe with Billings  13  In June 1938 Kennedy sailed overseas with his father and brother Joe to work with his father  who was then Franklin D  Roosevelt s U S  Ambassador to the Court of St  James s  at the American embassy in London  14  In 1939 Kennedy toured Europe  the Soviet Union  the Balkans  and the Middle East in preparation for his Harvard senior honors thesis  He then went to Czechoslovakia and Germany before returning to London on September 1  1939  the day Germany invaded Poland  On September 3  1939  the family was in the House of Commons for speeches endorsing the United Kingdom s declaration of war on Germany  Kennedy was sent as his father s representative to help with arrangements for American survivors of the SS Athenia  before flying back to the U S  from Foynes  Ireland  to Port Washington  New York on his first transatlantic flight  As an upperclassman at Harvard  Kennedy became a more serious student and developed an interest in political philosophy  In his junior year he made the Dean s List  15  In 1940 Kennedy completed his thesis   Appeasement in Munich   about British participation in the Munich Agreement  The thesis became a bestseller under the title Why England Slept  16  He graduated from Harvard College with a Bachelors of Science cum laude in international affairs in 1940  Kennedy enrolled and audited classes at the Stanford Graduate School of Business that fall  17  In early 1941  he helped his father write a memoir of his three years as an American ambassador and then traveled throughout South America  18  Military service Main article  Motor Torpedo Boat PT 109 Lieutenant  junior grade  John F  Kennedy  standing at right  with his PT 109 crew In September 1941  after medical disqualification by the Army for his chronic lower back problems  Kennedy joined the U S  Navy  with the influence of the director of the Office of Naval Intelligence  former naval attach  to Joseph Kennedy  19  Kennedy was an ensign serving in the office of the Secretary of the Navy when the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred  He attended the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps and Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Training Center  was assigned duty in Panama and later in the Pacific theater  where he earned the rank of lieutenant  commanding a patrol torpedo  PT  boat  20  Kennedy on his navy patrol boat  the PT 109 On August 2  1943  Kennedy s boat  PT 109  along with PT 162 and PT 169  were performing nighttime patrols near New Georgia in the Solomon Islands  21  when PT 109 was rammed by the Japanese destroyer Amagiri  22  Kennedy gathered his surviving crew members together in the water around the wreckage  to vote on whether to  fight or surrender   Kennedy stated   There s nothing in the book about a situation like this  A lot of you men have families and some of you have children  What do you want to do  I have nothing to lose   Shunning surrender  the men swam towards a small island  23  Kennedy  despite re injury to his back in the collision  towed a badly burned crewman through the water with a life jacket strap clenched between his teeth  24  He towed the wounded man to the island  and later to a second island  from where his crew was subsequently rescued  25  For these actions  Kennedy received the Navy and Marine Corps Medal with the following citation  For extremely heroic conduct as Commanding Officer of Motor Torpedo Boat 109 following the collision and sinking of that vessel in the Pacific War Theater on August 1 2  1943  Unmindful of personal danger  Lieutenant  then Lieutenant  Junior Grade  Kennedy unhesitatingly braved the difficulties and hazards of darkness to direct rescue operations  swimming many hours to secure aid and food after he had succeeded in getting his crew ashore  His outstanding courage  endurance and leadership contributed to the saving of several lives and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service  In October 1943 Kennedy took command of a PT boat converted into a gun boat  PT 59  which took part in a Marine rescue on Choiseul Island that November  26  Kennedy was honorably discharged in early 1945  just prior to Japan s surrender  Kennedy s other decorations in World War II included the Purple Heart  American Defense Service Medal  American Campaign Medal  Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal with three bronze service stars  and the World War II Victory Medal  1  When later asked how he became a war hero  Kennedy joked   It was easy  They cut my PT boat in half   27  In April 1945  Kennedy s father  a friend of William Randolph Hearst  arranged a position for his son as a special correspondent for Hearst Newspapers  the assignment kept Kennedy s name in the public eye and  expose d  him to journalism as a possible career   28  He worked as a correspondent that May  covering the Potsdam Conference and other events  29  Congressional career House of Representatives While Kennedy was still serving  his older brother  Joseph P  Kennedy  Jr   was killed in action on August 12  1944  while part of Operation Aphrodite  Since Joe Jr  had been the family s political standard bearer  the task now fell to John  30  In 1946  U S  Representative James Michael Curley vacated his seat in the strong Democratic 11th Congressional district in Massachusetts at Joe s urging to become mayor of Boston  Kennedy ran for the seat  beating his Republican opponent by a large margin  31  He served as a congressman for six years  Senate In the 1952 election  he defeated incumbent Republican Henry Cabot Lodge  Jr  for the U S  Senate seat  The following year he was married to Jacqueline  32  Kennedy underwent several spinal operations over the following two years  Often absent from the Senate  he was at times critically ill and received Catholic last rites  During his convalescence in 1956  he published Profiles in Courage  a book about U S  Senators who risked their careers for their personal beliefs  and which received the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1957  33  Rumors that this work was co authored by his close adviser and speechwriter  Ted Sorensen  were confirmed in Sorensen s 2008 autobiography  34  At the 1956 Democratic National Convention  Kennedy was nominated for Vice President on a ticket with presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson  but finished second in the balloting to Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee  Kennedy received national exposure from that episode  his father thought it just as well that his son lost  due to the political debility of his Catholicism and the strength of the Eisenhower ticket  One of the matters demanding Kennedy s attention in the Senate was President Eisenhower s bill for the Civil Rights Act of 1957  35  Kennedy cast a procedural vote on this  which was considered by some as an appeasement of Southern Democratic opponents of the bill  35  Kennedy did vote for Title III of the act  which would have given the Attorney General powers to enjoin  but Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson agreed to let the provision die as a compromise measure  36  Kennedy also voted for Title IV  termed the  Jury Trial Amendment   Many civil rights advocates at the time criticized that vote as one which would weaken the act  37  A final compromise bill  which Kennedy supported  was passed in September 1957  38  In 1958  Kennedy was re elected to a second term in the Senate  defeating his Republican opponent  Boston lawyer Vincent J  Celeste  by a wide margin  Senator Joseph McCarthy was a friend of the Kennedy family  Joseph Kennedy  Sr  was a leading McCarthy supporter  Robert F  Kennedy worked for McCarthy s subcommittee  and McCarthy dated Patricia Kennedy  In 1954  when the Senate voted to censure McCarthy  Kennedy drafted a speech supporting the censure  The speech was not delivered  because he was in the hospital  Though absent  he could have participated procedurally by  pairing  his vote against that of another senator  but did not do so  He never indicated how he would have voted  but the episode damaged Kennedy s support among members of the liberal community  including Eleanor Roosevelt  in the 1956 and 1960 elections  39  1960 presidential election Main article  United States presidential election  1960 On January 2  1960  Kennedy initiated his campaign for President in the Democratic primary election  where he faced challenges from Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota and Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon  Kennedy defeated Humphrey in Wisconsin and West Virginia  Morse in Maryland and Oregon  as well as from token opposition  often write in candidates  in New Hampshire  Indiana  and Nebraska  Kennedy visited a coal mine in West Virginia  most miners and others in that predominantly conservative  Protestant state were quite wary of Kennedy s Roman Catholicism  His victory in West Virginia confirmed his broad popular appeal  At the Democratic Convention  he gave his well known  New Frontier  speech  saying   For the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all won and we stand today on the edge of a New Frontier     But the New Frontier of which I speak is not a set of promises it is a set of challenges  It sums up not what I intend to offer the American people  but what I intend to ask of them   40  John and Jacqueline Kennedy campaigning in Appleton  Wisconsin  March 1960 With Humphrey and Morse eliminated  Kennedy s main opponent at the Los Angeles convention was Senator Lyndon B  Johnson of Texas  Kennedy overcame this formal challenge as well as informal ones from Adlai Stevenson  the Democratic nominee in 1952 and 1956  Stuart Symington  and several favorite sons  and on July 13 the Democratic convention nominated Kennedy as its candidate  Kennedy asked Johnson to be his Vice Presidential candidate  despite opposition from many liberal delegates and Kennedy s own staff  including his brother  Robert  He needed Johnson s strength in the South to win what was considered likely to be the closest election since 1916  Major issues included how to get the economy moving again  Kennedy s Roman Catholicism  Cuba  and whether the Soviet space and missile programs had surpassed those of the U S  To address fears that his being Catholic would impact his decision making  he famously told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12  1960   I am not the Catholic candidate for President  I am the Democratic Party candidate for President who also happens to be a Catholic  I do not speak for my Church on public matters   and the Church does not speak for me   41  Kennedy questioned rhetorically whether one quarter of Americans were relegated to second class citizenship just because they were Catholic  and once stated that   No one asked me my religion  serving the Navy  in the South Pacific   42  President Dwight D  Eisenhower meets with President elect John F  Kennedy on December 6  1960 In September and October  Kennedy appeared with Republican candidate Richard Nixon  then Vice President  in the first televised U S  presidential debates in U S  history  During these programs  Nixon  with a sore injured leg and his  five o clock shadow   looked tense  uncomfortable  and perspiring  while Kennedy  choosing to avail himself of makeup services  appeared relaxed  leading the huge television audience to favor Kennedy as the winner  Radio listeners either thought Nixon had won or that the debates were a draw  43  The debates are now considered a milestone in American political history the point at which the medium of television began to play a dominant role in politics  33  Kennedy s campaign gained momentum after the first debate  and he pulled slightly ahead of Nixon in most polls  On November 8  Kennedy defeated Nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the 20th century  In the national popular vote Kennedy led Nixon by just two tenths of one percent  49 7  to 49 5    while in the Electoral College he won 303 votes to Nixon s 219  269 were needed to win   Another 14 electors from Mississippi and Alabama refused to support Kennedy because of his support for the civil rights movement  they voted for Senator Harry F  Byrd of Virginia  as did the elector from Oklahoma  44  Kennedy was the youngest man elected president  succeeding Eisenhower  who was then the oldest  Ronald Reagan surpassed Eisenhower as the oldest president in 1981   45  Presidency Wikisource has original text related to this article  John F  Kennedy s Inaugural Address See also  Timeline of the presidency of John F  Kennedy John F  Kennedy takes the oath of office administered by Chief Justice Earl Warren on January 20  1961  at the Capitol John F  Kennedy was sworn in as the 35th President at noon on January 20  1961  In his inaugural address he spoke of the need for all Americans to be active citizens  famously saying   Ask not what your country can do for you  ask what you can do for your country   He asked the nations of the world to join together to fight what he called the  common enemies of man  tyranny  poverty  disease  and war itself   He added   All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days  Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days  nor in the life of this Administration  nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet  But let us begin   In closing  he expanded on his desire for greater internationalism   Finally  whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world  ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you   46  The address reflected Kennedy s confidence that his administration would chart a historically significant course in both domestic policy and foreign affairs  The contrast between this optimistic vision and the pressures of managing daily political realities at home and abroad would be one of the main tensions running through the early years of his administration  47  Kennedy brought to the White House a stark contrast in organization compared to the decision making structure of the former general  Eisenhower  and he wasted no time in dismantling Eisenhower s methods  48  Kennedy preferred the organizational structure of a wheel  with all the spokes leading to the president  He was ready and willing to make the increased number of quick decisions required in such an environment  He selected a mixture of experienced and inexperienced people to serve in his cabinet   We can learn our jobs together   he stated  49  There were a couple instances where the president got ahead of himself  as when he announced in a cabinet meeting  without prior notice  that Edward Lansdale would be Ambassador to South Vietnam  a decision which Secretary of State Rusk later had Kennedy alter  50  There was also the case of Harris Wofford  who was summoned to the White House for swearing in without knowing which position he was to assume  51  Much to the chagrin of his economic advisors  who wanted him to reduce taxes  he quickly agreed to a balanced budget pledge  This was needed in exchange for votes to expand the membership of the House Rules Committee in order to give the Democrats a majority in setting the legislative agenda  52  The president focused on immediate and specific issues facing the administration  and quickly voiced his impatience with ponderings of deeper meanings  Deputy national security advisor Walt Whitman Rostow once began a diatribe about the growth of communism  and Kennedy abruptly cut him off  asking   What do you want me to do about that today   53  Foreign policy Main article  Foreign policy of the John F  Kennedy administration Foreign trips of John F  Kennedy during his presidency President Kennedy s foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union  manifested by proxy contests in the early stage of the Cold War  In 1961  Kennedy anxiously anticipated a summit with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev  The President started off on the wrong foot by reacting aggressively to a routine Khrushchev speech on Cold War confrontation in early 1961  The speech was intended for domestic audiences in the Soviet Union  but Kennedy interpreted it as a personal challenge  His mistake helped raise tensions going into the Vienna Summit of June 1961  54  On the way to the summit  Kennedy stopped in Paris to meet Charles de Gaulle  who advised Kennedy to ignore Khrushchev s abrasive style  The French president was nationalistic and disdainful of the United States  presumed influence in Europe  Nevertheless de Gaulle was quite impressed with the young president and his family  Kennedy picked up on this in his speech in Paris  saying he would be remembered as  the man who accompanied Jackie Kennedy to Paris   55  On June 4  1961  the president met with Khrushchev in Vienna and left the meetings angry and disappointed that he had allowed the Premier to bully him  despite the warnings he had received  Khrushchev  for his part  was impressed with the president s intelligence  but thought him weak  Kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to Khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them  a proposed treaty between Moscow and East Berlin  He made it clear that any such treaty which interfered with U S access rights in West Berlin would be regarded as an act of war  56  Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran  Kennedy  and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara in the White House Cabinet Room on April 13  1962 Shortly after the president returned home  the U S S R  announced its intention to sign a treaty with East Berlin  abrogating any third party occupation rights in either sector of the city  Kennedy  depressed and angry  assumed his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war  which he personally thought had a one in five chance of occurring  57  In the weeks immediately after the Vienna summit  more than 20 000 people fled from East Berlin to the western sector in reaction to statements from the USSR  Kennedy began intensive meetings on the Berlin issue  where Dean Acheson took the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside NATO allies  58  In a July 1961 speech  Kennedy announced his decision to add  3 25 billion to the defense budget  along with over 200 000 additional troops  saying an attack on West Berlin would be taken as an attack on the U S  The speech received an 85  approval rating  59  The following month  the Soviet Union and East Berlin began blocking any further passage of East Berliners into West Berlin and erected barbed wire fences across the city  which were quickly upgraded to the Berlin Wall  Kennedy s initial reaction was to ignore this  as long as free access from West to East Berlin continued  This course was altered when it was learned that the West Berliners had lost confidence in the defense of their position by the United States  Kennedy sent Vice President Johnson  along with a host of military personnel  in convoy through West Germany  including Soviet armed checkpoints  to demonstrate the continued commitment of the U S  to West Berlin  60  Kennedy gave a speech at Saint Anselm College on May 5  1960  regarding America s conduct in the emerging Cold War  The address detailed how American foreign policy should be conducted towards African nations  noting a hint of support for modern African nationalism by saying that  For we  too  founded a new nation on revolt from colonial rule   61  Cuba and the Bay of Pigs Invasion Main article  Bay of Pigs Invasion The prior Eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow the Fidel Castro regime in Cuba  The plan  led by the Central Intelligence Agency  CIA  with help from the U S  military  62  was for an invasion of Cuba by a counter revolutionary insurgency composed of U S  trained anti Castro Cuban exiles 63  led by CIA paramilitary officers  The intention was to invade Cuba and instigate an uprising among the Cuban people in hopes of removing Castro from power  64  On April 17  1961  Kennedy ordered what became known as the  Bay of Pigs Invasion   1 500 U S  trained Cubans  called  Brigade 2506   landed on the island  No U S  air support was provided  Allen Dulles  director of the CIA  later stated that they thought the president would authorize any action required for success once the troops were on the ground  65  By April 19  1961  the Cuban government had captured or killed the invading exiles  and Kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the 1 189 survivors  After twenty months  Cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for  53 million worth of food and medicine  66  The incident made Castro wary of the U S  and led him to believe another invasion would occur  67  According to biographer Richard Reeves  Kennedy primarily focused on the political repercussions of the plan rather than the military considerations  when it failed  he was convinced the plan was a setup to make him look bad  68  But he took responsibility for the failure  saying       We got a big kick in the leg and we deserved it  But maybe we ll learn something from it   69  In late 1961 the White House formed the  Special Group  Augmented    headed by Robert Kennedy and including Edward Lansdale  Secretary Robert McNamara  and others  The group s objective to overthrow Castro via espionage  sabotage  and other covert tactics was never pursued  70  Cuban Missile Crisis Address on the Buildup of Arms in Cuba Kennedy addressing the nation on October 22  1962 about the buildup of arms on Cuba Problems listening to this file  See media help  Meeting Nikita Khrushchev in 1961 Main article  Cuban Missile Crisis On October 14  1962  CIA U 2 spy planes took photographs of intermediate range ballistic missile sites being built in Cuba by the Soviets  The photos were shown to Kennedy on October 16  a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and thus posed an immediate nuclear threat  71  Kennedy faced a dilemma  if the U S  attacked the sites  it might lead to nuclear war with the U S S R   but if the U S  did nothing  it would be faced with the increased threat from close range nuclear weapons  The U S  would as well appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the hemisphere  On a personal level  Kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to Khrushchev  especially after the Vienna summit  72  More than a third of the members of the National Security Council  NSC  favored an unannounced air assault on the missile sites  but for some of them this conjured up an image of  Pearl Harbor in reverse   73  There was as well some reaction from the international community  asked in confidence  that the assault plan was an overreaction in light of U S  missiles that had been placed in Turkey by Eisenhower  And there could be no assurance that the assault would be 100  effective  74  In concurrence with a majority vote of the NSC  Kennedy decided on a naval quarantine  On October 22 he dispatched a message to Khrushchev and announced the decision on TV  75  The U S  Navy would stop and inspect all Soviet ships arriving off Cuba  beginning October 24  The Organization of American States gave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles  The president exchanged two sets of letters with Khrushchev  to no avail  76 United Nations  UN  Secretary General U Thant requested both parties reverse their decisions and enter a cooling off period  Khrushchev said yes  but Kennedy said no  77  One Soviet flagged ship was stopped and boarded  On October 28 Khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites subject to UN inspections  78  The U S  publicly promised never to invade Cuba and privately agreed to remove its missiles in Turkey  which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with UGM 27 Polaris missles  79  This crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or since  In the end   the humanity  of the two men prevailed  80  The crisis improved the image of American willpower and the president s credibility  His approval rating increased from 66  to 77  immediately thereafter  81  Latin America and communism Main article  Kennedy and Latin America Arguing that  those who make peaceful revolution impossible  will make violent revolution inevitable   82  Kennedy sought to contain communism in Latin America by establishing the Alliance for Progress  which sent aid to troubled countries and sought greater human rights standards in the region  He worked closely with Governor of Puerto Rico Luis Mu oz Mar n for the development of the Alliance of Progress  and began working towards the autonomy of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico  When the president took office the Eisenhower administration  through the CIA  had begun formulating plans for the assassination of Castro in Cuba and Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic  Kennedy privately instructed the CIA that any such planning must include plausible deniability by the U S  His public position was in opposition  83  In June 1961 the Dominican Republic s leader was assassinated  in the days following the event  Undersecretary of State Chester Bowles led a cautious reaction by the nation  Robert Kennedy  who saw an opportunity for the U S   called Bowles  a gutless bastard  to his face  84  Peace Corps Executive Order 10924 Establishment of the Peace Corps John F  Kennedy s announcement of the establishment of the Peace Corps Problems listening to this file  See media help  As one of his first presidential acts  Kennedy

education  farming  health care  and construction  The organization grew to 5 000 members by March 1963 and 10 000 the following year  86  Since 1961  over 200 000 Americans have joined the Peace

Laos  indicating privately that Vietnam  and not Laos  should be deemed America s tripwire for communism s spread in the area  87  In May 1961 he dispatched Lyndon Johnson to meet with South Vietnam s President Ngo Dinh Diem  Johnson assured Diem more aid in molding a fighting force that could resist the communists  88  Kennedy announced a change of policy from support to partnership with Diem in defeat of communism in South Vietnam  89  Kennedy initially followed Eisenhower s lead  using limited military action to fight the communist forces led by Ho Chi Minh  90  Kennedy continued policies that provided political  economic  and military support to the South Vietnamese government  90  Late in 1961 the Viet Cong began assuming a predominant presence  initially seizing the provincial capital of Phuoc Vinh  91  Kennedy increased the number of helicopters  military advisors  and undeclared U S  Special Forces in the area  but he was reluctant to order a full scale deployment of troops  92  93  Kennedy formally authorized escalated involvement when he signed the  National Security Action Memorandum   Subversive Insurgency  War of Liberation   in early 1962  94  Secretary of State Dean Rusk voiced strong support for U S  involvement  95   Operation Ranch Hand   a large scale aerial defoliation effort  began on the roadsides of South Vietnam  96  b  Kennedy with future Australian Prime Minister Harold Holt in the Oval office in 1963 In April 1963 Kennedy assessed the situation in Vietnam   We don t have a prayer of staying in Vietnam  Those people hate us  They are going to throw our asses out of there at any point  But I can t give up that territory to the communists and get the American people to re elect me   97  Kennedy faced a crisis in Vietnam by July  despite increased U S  support  the South Vietnamese military was only marginally effective against pro communist Viet Cong forces  On August 21  just as the new U S  Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge arrived  Ngo Dinh Diem and his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu ordered South Vietnam forces  funded and trained by the CIA  to quell Buddhist demonstrations  The crackdowns heightened expectations of a coup d  tat to remove Diem with  or perhaps by  his brother  Nhu  98  Lodge was instructed to try to get Diem and Nhu to step down and leave the country  Diem would not listen to Lodge  99 Cable 243  DEPTEL 243   dated August 24  followed  declaring Washington would no longer tolerate Nhu s actions  and Lodge was ordered to pressure Diem to remove Nhu  If Diem refused  the Americans would explore alternative leadership  100  Lodge stated that the only workable option was to get the South Vietnamese generals to overthrow Diem and Nhu  as originally planned  101  At week s end  Kennedy learned from Lodge that the Diem government might  due to France s assistance to Nhu  be dealing secretly with the communists and might ask the Americans to leave  orders were sent to Saigon and throughout Washington to  destroy all coup cables   102  At the same time  the first formal anti Vietnam war sentiment was expressed by U S  clergy from the Ministers  Vietnam Committee  103  A White House meeting in September was indicative of the very different ongoing appraisals  the President was given updated assessments after personal inspections on the ground by the Department of Defense  General Victor Krulak  and the State Department  Joseph Mendenhall   Krulak said the military fight against the communists was progressing and being won  while Mendenhall stated that the country was civilly being lost to any U S  influence  Kennedy reacted  saying   Did you two gentlemen visit the same country   The president was unaware the two men were at such odds that they had not spoken to each other on the return flight  104  In October 1963 the president appointed Defense Secretary McNamara and General Maxwell D  Taylor to a Vietnam mission in another effort to synchronize the information and formulation of policy  The objective of the McNamara Taylor mission  emphasized the importance of getting to the bottom of the differences in reporting from U S  representatives in Vietnam   105  In meetings with McNamara  Taylor  and Lodge  Diem again refused to agree to governing measures insisted upon by the U S   helping to dispel McNamara s previous optimism about Diem  106  Taylor and McNamara were also enlightened by Vietnam s Vice President  Nguyen Ngoc Tho  choice of many to succeed Diem should a coup occur   who in detailed terms obliterated Taylor s information that the military was succeeding in the countryside  107  At Kennedy s insistence  the mission report contained a recommended schedule for troop withdrawals  1 000 by year s end and complete withdrawal in 1965  something the NSC considered a strategic fantasy  108  The final report declared that the military was making progress  that the increasingly unpopular Diem led government was not vulnerable to a coup  and that an assassination of Diem or Nhu was a possibility  109  In late October intelligence wires again reported that a coup against the Diem government was afoot  The source  Vietnamese General Duong Van Minh  also known as  Big Minh    wanted to know the U S  position  Kennedy instructed Lodge to offer covert assistance to the coup  excluding assassination  and to ensure deniability by the U S  110  Later that month  as the coup became imminent  Kennedy ordered all cables routed through him  A policy of  control and cut out  was initiated to insure presidential control of U S  responses  while cutting him out of the paper trail  111  On November 1  1963  South Vietnamese generals  led by  Big Minh   overthrew the Diem government  arresting and then killing Diem and Nhu  Kennedy was shocked by the deaths  He found out afterwards that Minh had asked the CIA field office to secure safe passage out of the country for Diem and Nhu  but was told 24 hours was needed to get a plane  Minh responded that he could not hold them that long  112  News of the coup initially led to renewed confidence both in America and in South Vietnam that the war might be won  113 McGeorge Bundy drafted a National Security Action Memo to present to Kennedy upon his return from Dallas  It reiterated the resolve to fight communism in Vietnam  with increasing military and economic aid and expansion of operations into Laos and Cambodia  Before leaving for Dallas  Kennedy told Michael Forrestal that  after the first of the year      he wanted  an in depth study of every possible option  including how to get out of there     to review this whole thing from the bottom to the top   When asked what he thought the president meant  Forrestal said   it was devil s advocate stuff   114  Historians disagree on whether Vietnam would have escalated had Kennedy survived and been re elected in 1964  115  Fueling the debate are statements made by Secretary of Defense McNamara in the film  The Fog of War  that Kennedy was strongly considering pulling out of Vietnam after the 1964 election  116  The film also contains a tape recording of Lyndon Johnson stating that Kennedy was planning to withdraw  a position that Johnson disagreed with  117  Kennedy had signed National Security Action Memorandum  NSAM  263  dated October 11  which ordered the withdrawal of 1 000 military personnel by the end of the year  118  119  Such an action would have been a policy reversal  but Kennedy was moving in a less hawkish direction since his acclaimed speech about world peace at American University on June 10  1963  120  When Robert Kennedy was asked in 1964 what his brother would have done if the South Vietnamese had been on the brink of defeat  he replied   We d face that when we came to it   121  At the time of Kennedy s death  no final policy decision had been made as to Vietnam  122  U S  involvement in the region escalated until Lyndon Johnson  his successor  directly deployed regular U S  military forces for fighting the Vietnam War  123  124  After Kennedy s assassination  President Johnson passed NSAM 273 on November 26  1963  It reversed Kennedy s decision to withdraw 1 000 troops  and reaffirmed the policy of assistance to the South Vietnamese  125  126  American University speech Kennedy delivers the commencement speech at American University  June 10  1963 Wikisource has original text related to this article  A Strategy of Peace World Peace Speech Speech from American University by John F  Kennedy  June 10  1963  duration 26 47  Problems listening to this file  See media help  On June 10  1963  Kennedy delivered the commencement address at American University in Washington  D C    to discuss a topic on which too often ignorance abounds and the truth is too rarely perceived   yet it is the most important topic on earth  world peace     I speak of peace because of the new face of war   in an age when a singular nuclear weapon contains ten times the explosive force delivered by all the allied forces in the Second World War     an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and air and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn     I speak of peace  therefore  as the necessary rational end of rational men     world peace  like community peace  does not require that each man love his neighbor   it requires only that they live together in mutual tolerance     our problems are man made   therefore they can be solved by man  And man can be as big as he wants   127  The president also made two announcements   that the Soviets had expressed a desire to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty and that the U S had postponed planned atmospheric tests  128

text related to this article  JFK s Ich bin ein Berliner speech In 1963 Germany was enduring a time of particular vulnerability due to Soviet aggression to the east  de Gaulle s French nationalism to the west  and the impending retirement of German Chancellor Adenauer  129  On June 26 Kennedy gave a public speech in West Berlin reiterating the American commitment to Germany and criticizing communism  he was met with an ecstatic response from a massive audience  Kennedy used the construction of the Berlin Wall as an example of the failures of communism   Freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect  but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in   The speech is known for its famous phrase  Ich bin ein Berliner    I am a citizen of Berlin    A million people were on the street for the speech  130  He remarked to Ted Sorensen afterwards   We ll never have another day like this one  as long as we live   131  Israel Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir with President Kennedy  1962  Kennedy encountered problems with the Israeli government regarding the production of nuclear materials in Dimona  After the existence of a nuclear plant was initially denied by the Israeli government  David Ben Gurion stated in a speech to the Israeli Knesset on December 21  1960  that the purpose of the nuclear plant at Beersheba was for  research in problems of arid zones and desert flora and fauna   132  When Ben Gurion met with Kennedy in New York  he claimed that Dimona was being developed to provide nuclear power for desalinization and other peaceful purposes  for the time being   132  Kennedy was skeptical  and stated in a May 1963 letter to Ben Gurion that American support to Israel could be in jeopardy if reliable information on the Israeli nuclear program was not forthcoming  Ben Gurion repeated previous reassurances that Dimona was being developed for peaceful purposes  The Israeli government resisted American pressure to open its nuclear facilities to International Atomic Energy Agency  IAEA  inspections  A science attache at the embassy in Tel Aviv concluded that parts of the Dimona facility had been shut down temporarily to mislead American scientists when they visited  According to Seymour Hersh  the Israelis set up false control rooms to show the Americans  Israeli lobbyist Abe Feinberg stated   It was part of my job to tip them off that Kennedy was insisting on  an inspection    133 Rodger Davies  the director of the State Department s Office of Near Eastern Affairs  concluded in March 1965 that Israel was developing nuclear weapons  He reported that Israel s target date for achieving nuclear capability was 1968 69  134  On May 1  1968  Undersecretary of State Nicholas Katzenbach told President Johnson that Dimona was producing enough plutonium to produce two bombs a year  The State Department argued that if Israel wanted arms  it should accept international supervision of its nuclear program  133  Dimona was never placed under IAEA safeguards  Attempts to write Israeli adherence to the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty  NPT  into contracts for the supply of U S  weapons continued throughout 1968  135  Iraq In 1963 the Kennedy administration backed a coup against the government of Iraq headed by Abd al Karim Qasim  who five years earlier had deposed the Western allied Iraqi monarchy  The new Ba ath Party government  led by Abdul Salam Arif  used lists provided by the CIA of suspected communists and other leftists to systematically murder unknown numbers of Iraq s educated elite  killings in which Saddam Hussein may have participated  The victims included hundreds of doctors  teachers  technicians  lawyers  other professionals  and military and political figures  The United States provided arms to Kurdish insurgents in Iraq  136  137  Ireland President Kennedy in motorcade in the Republic of Ireland on June 27  1963 During his visit to the Republic of Ireland in 1963  Kennedy accepted a grant of armorial bearings from the Chief Herald of Ireland and received honorary degrees from the National University of Ireland and Trinity College  Dublin  138  He visited the cottage at Dunganstown  near New Ross  where his ancestors had lived before emigrating to America  139  On December 22  2006  the Irish Department of Justice released declassified police documents indicating that security was heightened as Kennedy was the subject of three death threats during this visit  140  Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Main article  Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Troubled by the long term dangers of radioactive contamination and nuclear weapons proliferation  Kennedy and Khrushchev agreed to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty  originally conceived in Adlai Stevenson s 1956 presidential campaign  141  In their Vienna summit meeting in June 1961  Khrushchev and Kennedy reached an informal understanding against nuclear testing  but the Soviet Union began testing nuclear weapons that September  The United States responded by conducting tests five days later  142  Shortly thereafter  new U S  satellites began delivering images which made it clear that the Soviets were substantially behind the U S  in the arms race  143  Nevertheless  the greater nuclear strength of the U S  was of little value as long as the U S S R  perceived themselves to be at parity  144  In July 1963 Kennedy sent Averell Harriman to Moscow to negotiate a treaty with the Soviets  145  The introductory sessions included Khrushchev  who later delegated Soviet representation to Andrei Gromyko  It quickly became clear that a comprehensive test ban would not be implemented  due largely to the reluctance of the Soviets to allow inspections that would verify compliance  146  Ultimately  the United States  the United Kingdom  and the Soviet Union were the initial signatories to a limited treaty  which prohibited atomic testing on the ground  in the atmosphere  or underwater  but not underground  the U S  Senate ratified this and Kennedy signed it into law in October 1963  France was quick to declare that it was free to continue developing and testing its nuclear defenses  147  Domestic policy Kennedy called his domestic program the  New Frontier   It ambitiously promised federal funding for education  medical care for the elderly  economic aid to rural regions  and government intervention to halt the recession  Kennedy also promised an end to racial discrimination  In his 1963 State of the Union address  he proposed substantial tax reform and a reduction in income tax rates from the current range of 20 90  to a range of 14 65   he proposed a reduction in the corporate tax rates from 52 to 47   Kennedy added that the top rate should be set at 70 percent if certain deductions were not eliminated for high income earners  148  Congress did not act until 1964  after his death  when the top rate was raised to 70   To the Economic Club of New York  he spoke in 1963 of      the paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high and revenues too low  and the soundest way to raise revenue in the long term is to lower rates now   149  Congress passed few of Kennedy s major programs during his lifetime  but did vote them through in 1964 65 under his successor Johnson  150  Economy Kennedy ended a period of tight fiscal policies  loosening monetary policy to keep interest rates down and encourage growth of the economy  151  He presided over the first government budget to top the  100 billion mark  in 1962  and his first budget in 1961 led to the country s first non war  non recession deficit  152  The economy  which had been through two recessions in three years and was in one when Kennedy took office  accelerated notably during his presidency  Despite low inflation and interest rates  GDP had grown by an average of only 2 2  during the Eisenhower presidency  scarcely more than population growth at the time   and had declined by 1  during Eisenhower s last twelve months in office  153  The economy turned around and prospered during the Kennedy administration  GDP expanded by an average of 5 5  from early 1961 to late 1963  153  while inflation remained steady at around 1  and unemployment eased  154  industrial production rose by 15  and motor vehicle sales rose by 40   155  This rate of growth in GDP and industry continued until around 1966  and has yet to be repeated for such a sustained period of time  153  The major steel companies announced in April 1962 a 3 5  price increase  the first in 3 years  within a day of each other  This came just days after the companies had reached a settlement with the steelworkers  union  providing in chief a wage increase of 2 5   The administration was furious  with Kennedy saying   Why did they do this  Do they think they can get away with this  God  I hate the bastards   citation needed  Amid concern about the inflationary effects of the price increase  the president took personal charge of a campaign against the industry  assigning to each cabinet member a statement regarding the effects of the price increase on their area  Robert Kennedy  echoing his brother s sentiments  said  We re going for broke     their expense accounts  where they ve been and what they ve been doing     the FBI is to interview them all     we can t lose this   156  Robert took the position that the steel executives had illegally colluded to fix prices  The administration s actions influenced US Steel to rescind the price increase  157 The Wall Street Journal wrote that the administration had acted  by naked power  by threats  by agents of the state security police   158  Yale law professor Charles Reich wrote in The New Republic his opinion that the administration had violated civil liberties by calling a grand jury to indict US Steel for collusion so quickly  158  A New York Times editorial praised Kennedy s actions and said that the steel industry s price increase  imperils the economic welfare of the country by inviting a tidal wave of inflation   159  Nevertheless  the administration s Bureau of Budget reported the price increase would have resulted in a net gain for GDP as well as a net budget surplus  160  The stock market  which had steadily declined since Kennedy s election  dropped 10  shortly after the administration s action on the steel industry  161  Kennedy had little knowledge of the agricultural sector of the economy  and farmers were not on his list of priorities  at least in his 1960 campaign  After giving a speech to a farming community  he rhetorically asked an aide   Did you understand any of what I just said in there  I sure didn t   162  Federal and military death penalty As President  Kennedy oversaw the last federal execution prior to Furman v  Georgia  a 1972 case that led to a moratorium on federal executions  163 Victor Feguer was sentenced to death by a federal court in Iowa was executed on March 15  1963  164  Kennedy commuted a death sentence imposed by a military court on seaman Jimmie Henderson on February 12  1962  changing the penalty to life in prison  165  On March 22  1962  Kennedy signed into law HR5143  PL87 423   abolishing the mandatory death penalty for first degree murder in the District of Columbia  the only remaining jurisdiction in the United States with such a penalty  166  The death penalty has not been applied in the District of Columbia since 1957  and has now been abolished  167  Civil rights The turbulent end of state sanctioned racial discrimination was one of the most pressing domestic issues of the 1960s  The Supreme Court of the United States had ruled in 1954 in Brown v  Board of Education that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional  Many schools  especially in southern states  did not obey the Supreme Court s decision  The Court also prohibited segregation at other public facilities  such as buses  restaurants  theaters  courtrooms  bathrooms  and beaches  but it continued nonetheless  Kennedy verbally supported racial integration and civil rights  during the 1960 campaign he telephoned Coretta Scott King  wife of the Reverend Martin Luther King  Jr   who had been jailed while trying to integrate a department store lunch counter  Robert Kennedy called Georgia governor Ernest Vandiver and obtained King s release from prison  which drew additional black support to his brother s candidacy  168  President Kennedy s Civil Rights Address  June 11  1963 Kennedy believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would anger many Southern whites and make it more difficult to pass civil rights laws in Congress  which was dominated by conservative Southern Democrats  and he distanced himself from it  169  He also was more concerned with other issues early in his presidency  such as the Bay of Pigs fiasco and the situation in Southeast Asia  As articulated by brother Robert  the administration s early priority was to  keep the president out of this civil rights mess   Many civil rights leaders viewed Kennedy as lukewarm  especially concerning the Freedom Riders  who organized an integrated public transportation effort in the south  and who were repeatedly met with violence by whites  including law enforcement officers  both federal and state  Kennedy assigned federal marshals to protect the Freedom Riders as an alternative to using federal troops or uncooperative FBI agents  Robert Kennedy  speaking for the president  urged the Freedom Riders to  get off the buses and leave the matter to peaceful settlement in the courts   170  In September 1962  James Meredith enrolled at the University of Mississippi  but was prevented from entering  Attorney General Robert Kennedy responded by sending 400 federal marshals  while President Kennedy reluctantly sent 3 000 troops after the situation on campus turned violent  171  The Ole Miss riot of 1962 left two dead and dozens injured  but Meredith did finally enroll in his first class  On November 20  1962  Kennedy signed Executive Order 11063  prohibiting racial discrimination in federally supported housing or  related facilities   172  In early 1963  Kennedy related to Martin Luther King  Jr   about the prospects for civil rights legislation   If we get into a long fight over this in Congress  it will bottleneck everything else  and we will still get no bill   173  However  civil rights clashes were on the rise that year  174  Brother Robert and Ted Sorenson pressed Kennedy to take more initiative on the legislative front  175  On June 11  1963  President Kennedy intervened when Alabama Governor George Wallace blocked the doorway to the University of Alabama to stop two African American students  Vivian Malone and James Hood  from attending  Wallace moved aside only after being confronted by Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and the Alabama National Guard  which had just been federalized by order of the President  and which had hours earlier been under Wallace s command  That evening Kennedy gave his famous civil rights address on national television and radio  launching his initiative for civil rights legislation   to provide equal access to public schools and other facilities  and greater protection of voting rights  176  177  His proposals became part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  The day ended with the murder of a NAACP leader  Medgar Evers  in front of his home in Mississippi  178  As the president had predicted  the day after his TV speech  and in reaction to it  House Majority leader Carl Albert called to advise him that his two year signature effort in Congress to combat poverty in Appalachia  Area Redevelopment Administration  had been defeated  primarily by the votes of Southern Democrats and Republicans  179  Kennedy with leaders of the March on Washington  August 28  1963 Kennedy signed the executive order creating the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women on December 14  1961  180  Former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt led the commission  The Commission statistics revealed that women were also experiencing discrimination  their final report documenting legal and cultural barriers was issued in October 1963  181  Earlier  on June 10  1963  Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act of 1963  a federal law amending the Fair Labor Standards Act  aimed at abolishing wage disparity based on sex  182  Over a hundred thousand  predominantly African Americans  gathered in Washington for the civil rights March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28  1963  Kennedy feared the March would have a negative effect on the prospects for the civil rights bills in Congress  and declined an invitation to speak  He turned over some of the details of the government s involvement to the Dept  of Justice  which channelled hundreds of thousands of dollars to the six sponsors of the March  including the N A A C P  and Martin Luther King s Southern Christian Leadership Conference  SCLC   To ensure a peaceful demonstration  the organizers and the president personally edited speeches which were inflammatory and agreed the March would be held on a Wednesday and would be over at 4 00 pm  Thousands of troops were placed on standby  Kennedy watched King s speech on TV and was very impressed  The March was considered a  triumph of managed protest   and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred  Afterwards  the March leaders accepted an invitation to the White House to meet with Kennedy and photos were taken  Kennedy felt the March was a victory for him as well and bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill  183  Nevertheless  the struggle was far from over  Three weeks later  a bomb exploded on a Sunday at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham  at the end of the day six children had died in the explosion and aftermath  184  As a result of this resurgent violence  the civil rights legislation underwent some drastic amendments that critically endangered any prospects for passage of the bill  to the outrage of the president  Kennedy called the congressional leaders to the White House and by the following day the original bill  without the additions  had enough votes to get it out of the House committee  185  Civil liberties In 1963  FBI Director J  Edgar Hoover  who hated civil rights leader Martin Luther King  Jr  and viewed him as an upstart troublemaker  186  presented the Kennedy Administration with allegations that some of King s close confidants and advisers were communists  Concerned that the allegations  if made public  would derail the Administration s civil rights initiatives  Robert Kennedy and the president both warned King to discontinue the suspect associations  After the associations continued  Robert Kennedy felt compelled to issue a written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference  King s civil rights organization  187  Although Kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of King s phones  on a trial basis  for a month or so   188  Hoover extended the clearance so his men were  unshackled  to look for evidence in any areas of King s life they deemed worthy  189  The wire tapping continued through June 1966 and was revealed in 1968  190  Immigration John F  Kennedy initially proposed an overhaul of American immigration policy that later was to become the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965  sponsored by Kennedy s brother Senator Edward Kennedy  It dramatically shifted the source of immigration from Northern and Western European countries towards immigration from Latin America and Asia and shifted the emphasis of selection of immigrants towards facilitating family reunification  191  Kennedy wanted to dismantle the selection of immigrants based on country of origin and saw this as an extension of his civil rights policies  192  Space program Wikisource has original text

September 12  1962  duration 17 47  Further information  Space Race and Space policy of the United States The Apollo program was conceived early in 1960  during the Eisenhower administration  as a follow up to Project Mercury  While NASA went ahead with planning for Apollo  funding for the program was far from certain given Eisenhower s opposition to manned spaceflight  Kennedy s advisors speculated that a moon flight would be prohibitively expensive  193  but he postponed the decision out of deference to his vice president  Johnson had been appointed chairman of the U S  Space Council 194  and strongly supported NASA because its new Manned Spacecraft Center was located in Texas  195  In his January 1961 State of the Union address  Kennedy had suggested international cooperation in space  Khrushchev declined  as the Soviets did not wish to reveal the status of their rocketry and space capabilities  196  On April 12  1961  Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person to fly in space  reinforcing American fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the Soviet Union  197  Kennedy was eager for the U S  to take the lead in the Space Race for reasons of strategy and prestige  He first announced the goal of landing a man on the Moon in the speech to a Joint Session of Congress on May 25  1961  stating   First  I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal  before this decade is out  of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth  No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind  or more important for the long range exploration of space  and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish   198  Kennedy made a speech at Rice University on September 12  1962  in which he said   No nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space        We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things  not because they are easy  but because they are hard   199  On November 21  1962  in a cabinet meeting with NASA administrator James E  Webb and other officials  Kennedy explained that the moon shot was important for reasons of international prestige  and that the expense was justified  200  Johnson assured him that lessons learned from the space program had military value as well  Costs for the Apollo program were expected to reach  40 billion  201  In a September 1963 speech before the United Nations  Kennedy urged cooperation between the Soviets and Americans in space  Khrushchev again declined  and the Soviets did not commit to a manned moon mission until 1964  202  On July 20  1969  almost six years after Kennedy s death  Apollo 11 landed the first manned spacecraft on the Moon  Native American relations Further information  Kinzua Dam Native Americans and Seneca nation Kinzua Dam Construction of the Kinzua Dam flooded 10 000 acres  4 047 ha  of Seneca nation land that they had occupied under the Treaty of 1794  and forced 600 Seneca to relocate to Salamanca  New York  Kennedy was asked by the American Civil Liberties Union to intervene and halt the project  but he declined  citing a critical need for flood control  He expressed concern about the plight of the Seneca  and directed government agencies to assist in obtaining more land  damages  and assistance to help mitigate their displacement  203  204  Assassination JFK  Jackie  and the Connallys in the presidential limousine seconds before the assassination Main article  Assassination of John F  Kennedy President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas  Texas  at 12 30 pm Central Standard Time on November 22  1963  while on a political trip to Texas to smooth over frictions in the Democratic Party between liberals Ralph Yarborough and Don Yarborough  no relation  and conservative John Connally  205  He was shot once in the upper back and killed with a final shot to the head  He was taken to Parkland Hospital for emergency medical treatment  but pronounced dead at 1 00 pm  Only 46  President Kennedy died younger than any U S  president to date  Lee Harvey Oswald  an employee of the Texas School Book Depository from which the shots were suspected to have been fired  was arrested on charges for the murder of a local police officer and was subsequently charged with the assassination of Kennedy  He denied shooting anyone  claiming he was a patsy  206  207  but was killed by Jack Ruby on November 24  before he could be indicted or tried  Ruby was then arrested and convicted for the murder of Oswald  Ruby successfully appealed his conviction and death sentence but became ill and died of cancer on January 3  1967  while the date for his new trial was being set  208  President Johnson created the Warren Commission chaired by Chief Justice Earl Warren to investigate the assassination  which concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin  The results of this investigation are disputed by many  209  The assassination proved to be an important moment in U S  history because of its impact on the nation and the ensuing political repercussions  Funeral Main article  State funeral of John F  Kennedy A Requiem Mass was held for Kennedy at the Cathedral of St  Matthew the Apostle on November 25  1963  Afterwards  John F  Kennedy s body was buried in a small plot   20 by 30 ft    in Arlington National Cemetery  Over a period of 3 years   1964 1966   an estimated 16 million people had visited his grave  On March 14  1967  Kennedy s body was moved to a permanent burial plot and memorial at the Cemetery  The funeral was officiated by Father John J  Cavanaugh  210  It was from this memorial that the graves of both Robert and Ted were modeled  The honor guard at JFK s graveside was the 37th Cadet Class of the Irish Army  JFK was greatly impressed by the Irish Cadets on his last official visit to the Republic of Ireland  so much so that Jackie Kennedy requested the Irish Army to be the honor guard at the funeral  211  Kennedy s wife  Jacqueline and their two deceased minor children were buried with him later  His brother  Senator Robert Kennedy  was buried nearby in June 1968  In August 2009  his brother  Senator Edward M  Kennedy  was also buried near his two brothers  JFK s grave is lit with an  Eternal Flame   Kennedy and William Howard Taft are the only two U S  Presidents buried at Arlington  212  213  Administration  Cabinet  and judicial appointments 1961 1963 The official White House portrait of John F  Kennedy by Aaron

Image  social life and family Further information  Kennedy family The Kennedy family in Hyannis Port in 1963 John Kennedy met his future wife  Jacqueline Bouvier  when he was a congressman  Charles L  Bartlett  a journalist  introduced the pair at a dinner party  214  They were married a year after he was elected senator  on September 12  1953  215  Kennedy and his wife were younger in comparison to the presidents and first ladies that preceded them  and both were popular in ways more common to pop singers and movie stars than politicians  influencing fashion trends and becoming the subjects of numerous photo spreads in popular magazines  Although Eisenhower had allowed presidential press conferences to be filmed for television  Kennedy was the first president to ask for them to be broadcast live and made good use of the medium  216  Jacqueline brought new art and furniture to the White House  and directed its restoration  They invited a range of artists  writers and intellectuals to rounds of White House dinners  raising the profile of the arts in America  The Kennedy family is one of the most established political families in the United States  having produced a President  three senators  and multiple other Representatives  both on the federal and state level  John Kennedy s father  Joseph P  Kennedy  was a prominent American businessman and political figure  serving in multiple roles  including Ambassador to the United Kingdom  from 1938 to 1940  Jacqueline Kennedy in Fort Worth  Texas  November 22  1963 Outside on the White House lawn  the Kennedys established a swimming pool and tree house  while Caroline attended a preschool along with 10 other children inside the home  The president was closely tied to popular culture  emphasized by songs such as  Twisting at the White House   Vaughn Meader s First Family comedy album an album parodying the President  First Lady  their family and administration sold about four million copies  On May 19  1962  Marilyn Monroe sang  Happy Birthday  Mr  President  at a large party in Madison Square Garden  celebrating Kennedy s upcoming forty fifth birthday  The charisma of Kennedy and his family led to the figurative designation of  Camelot  for his administration  credited by his wife to his affection for the then contemporary Broadway musical of the same name  217  Behind the glamorous facade  the Kennedys also experienced many personal tragedies  Jacqueline had a miscarriage in 1955 and a stillbirth in 1956  Their newborn son  Patrick Bouvier Kennedy  died in August 1963  Kennedy had two children who survived infancy  One of the fundamental aspects of the Kennedy family is a tragic strain which has run through the family  as a result of the violent and untimely deaths of many of its members  John s eldest brother  Joseph P  Kennedy  Jr   died in World War II  at the age of 29  It was Joe Jr  who was originally to carry the family s hopes for the Presidency  Then both John himself  and his brother Robert died as a result of assassinations  Edward had brushes with death  the first in a plane crash and the second as a result of a car accident  known as the Chappaquiddick incident  Edward died at age 77  on August 25  2009  from the effects of a malignant brain tumor  Years after Kennedy s death  it was revealed that in September 1947  at age 30  and while in his first term in Congress  he was diagnosed by Sir Daniel Davis at The London Clinic with Addison s disease  a rare endocrine disorder  In 1966  his White House doctor  Janet Travell  revealed that Kennedy also had hypothyroidism  The presence of two endocrine diseases raises the possibility that Kennedy had autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2  APS 2   218  He also suffered from chronic and severe back pain  for which he had surgery and was written up in the AMA s Archives of Surgery  Kennedy s condition may even have had diplomatic repercussions  as he appears to have been taking a combination of drugs to treat severe pain during the 1961 Vienna Summit with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev  The combination included hormones  animal organ cells  steroids  vitamins  enzymes  and amphetamines  and potential side effects included hyperactivity  hypertension  impaired judgment  nervousness  and significant mood swings  219  Kennedy at one time was regularly seen by no fewer than three doctors  one of whom  Max Jacobson was unknown to the other two  as his mode of treatment was controversial 220  and used for the most severe bouts of pain  221  There was often disagreement among his doctors  as in late 1961  over the proper balance of medication and exercise  with the president preferring the former as he was short on time and desired immediate relief  144  Details of these and other medical problems were not publicly disclosed during Kennedy s lifetime  222  Caroline Bouvier Kennedy was born in 1957 and is the only surviving member of JFK s immediate family  John F  Kennedy  Jr  was born in 1960  just a few weeks after his father was elected  John died in 1999  when the small plane he was piloting crashed en route to Martha s Vineyard  killing him  his wife  Carolyn Bessette  and his sister in law  223  In October 1951  during his third term as Massachusetts s 11th district congressman  the then 34 year old Kennedy embarked on a seven week Asian trip to India  Japan  Vietnam  and Israel with his then 25 year old brother Robert  who had just graduated from law school four months earlier  and his then 27 year old sister Patricia  Because of their eight year separation in age  the two brothers had previously seen little of each other  This 25 000 mile  40 000 km  trip was the first extended time they had spent together and resulted in their becoming best friends  in addition to being brothers  Robert was campaign manager for Kennedy s successful 1952 Senate campaign and later  his successful 1960 presidential campaign  The two brothers worked closely together from 1957 to 1959 on the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor and Management Field  when Robert was its chief counsel  During Kennedy s presidency  Robert served in his cabinet as Attorney General and was his closest advisor  224  Kennedy was a Life Member of the National Rifle Association  225  226  Kennedy came in third  behind Martin Luther King  Jr  and Mother Teresa  in Gallup s List of Widely Admired People of the 20th century  227  228  Extra marital relationships Kennedy reportedly had affairs with a number of women  including Marilyn Monroe  229 Gunilla von Post  230 Judith Campbell  231 Mary Pinchot Meyer  232 Marlene Dietrich  233  and Mimi Alford  234  Doctors speculated that the drugs the president required for Addison s disease had the side effect of increasing his virility  144  The president remarked to UK Prime Minister Harold Macmillan   I wonder how it is for you  Harold  If I don t have a woman for three days  I get terrible headaches   235  Kennedy inspired affection and loyalty from the members of his team and his supporters  236  According to Reeves  this included  the logistics of Kennedy s liaisons      which  required secrecy and devotion rare in the annals of the energetic service demanded by successful politicians   237  Kennedy believed that his friendly relationship with members of the press would help protect him from revelations about his sex life  238  Ancestors The Kennedy family originally came from Dunganstown  County Wexford  239  In 1848  Patrick Kennedy left his farm and boarded a ship in New Ross bound for Liverpool on his way to Boston  240  It was here he met the woman he was to marry  Bridget Murphy  241  Patrick Kennedy came to Boston  took a job as a migrant worker  and died within eight or nine years  of cholera  242  He left behind a widow and children to carry on  Ancestors of John F  Kennedy                                     16  James Kennedy               8

Legacy Television became the primary source by which people were kept informed of events surrounding John F  Kennedy s assassination  Newspapers were kept as souvenirs rather than sources of updated information  In this sense it was the first major  TV news event  of its kind  the TV coverage uniting the nation  interpreting what went on and creating memories of this space in time  All three major U S  television networks suspended their regular schedules and switched to all news coverage from November 22 through November 25  1963  being on the air for 70 hours  making it the longest uninterrupted news event on American TV until 9 11  243 Kennedy s state funeral procession and the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald were all broadcast live in America and in other places around the world  The state funeral was the first of three in a span of 12 months  The other two were for General Douglas MacArthur and Herbert Hoover  All three have two things in common  the commanding general of the Military District of Washington during those funerals was Army Major General Philip C  Wehle and the riderless horse was Black Jack  who also served in that role during Lyndon B  Johnson s funeral  The assassination had an effect on many people  not only in the U S  but around the world  Many vividly remember where they were when first learning of the news that Kennedy was assassinated  as with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7  1941 before it and the September 11 attacks after it  UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson said of the assassination   all of us    will bear the grief of his death until the day of ours   Many people have also spoken of the shocking news  compounded by the pall of uncertainty about the identity of the assassin s   the possible instigators and the causes of the killing as an end to innocence  and in retrospect it has been coalesced with other changes of the tumultuous decade of the 1960s  especially the Vietnam War  Special Forces have a special bond with Kennedy   It was President Kennedy who was responsible for the rebuilding of the Special Forces and giving us back our Green Beret   said Forrest Lindley  a writer for the newspaper Stars and Stripes who served with Special Forces in Vietnam  c  This bond was shown at JFK s funeral  At the commemoration of the 25th anniversary of JFK s death  Gen  Michael D  Healy  the last commander of Special Forces in Vietnam  spoke at Arlington Cemetery  Later  a wreath in the form of the Green Beret would be placed on the grave  continuing a tradition that began the day of his funeral when a sergeant in charge of a detail of Special Forces men guarding the grave placed his beret on the coffin  Kennedy was the first of six Presidents to have served in the U S  Navy  244  and one of the enduring legacies of his administration was the creation in 1961 of another special forces command  the Navy SEALs  245  which Kennedy enthusiastically supported  246  Ultimately  the death of President Kennedy and the ensuing confusion surrounding the facts of his assassination are of political and historical importance insofar as they marked a turning point and decline in the faith of the American people in the political establishment a point made by commentators from Gore Vidal to Arthur M  Schlesinger  Jr  and implied by Oliver Stone in several of his films  such as his landmark 1991 JFK  Kennedy moved further on civil rights than his predecessors  In a radio and TV address to the nation in June 1963   a century after Abraham Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation  Kennedy became the first president to call on all Americans to embrace civil rights as a moral imperative  The year after JFK s assassination  President Johnson pushed the landmark Civil Rights Act through a bitterly divided Congress by invoking the slain president s memory  Kennedy s continuation of Presidents Harry S  Truman and Dwight D  Eisenhower s policies of giving economic and military aid to South Vietnam left the door open for President Johnson s escalation of the conflict  247  At the time of Kennedy s death  no final policy decision had been made as to Vietnam  leading historians  cabinet members and writers to continue to disagree on whether the Vietnam conflict would have escalated to the point it did had he survived  248  122  The Vietnam War contributed greatly to a decade of national difficulties and disappointment on the political landscape  Many of Kennedy s speeches  especially his inaugural address  are considered iconic  and despite his relatively short term in office and lack of major legislative changes coming to fruition during his term  Americans regularly vote him as one of the best presidents  in the same league as Abraham Lincoln  George Washington  and Franklin D  Roosevelt  Some excerpts of Kennedy s inaugural address are engraved on a plaque at his grave at Arlington  He was posthumously awarded the Pacem in Terris Award  It was named after a 1963 encyclical letter by Pope John XXIII that calls upon all people of goodwill to secure peace among all nations  Pacem in Terris is Latin for  Peace on Earth   President Kennedy is the only president to have predeceased both his mother and father  He is also the only president to have predeceased a grandparent  His grandmother  Mary Josephine Hannon Fitzgerald  died in 1964  just over eight months after his assassination  Throughout the English speaking world  the given name Kennedy has sometimes been used in honour of President Kennedy  as well his brother Robert  249
