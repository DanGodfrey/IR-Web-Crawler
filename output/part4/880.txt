the largest broadcaster in the world  with about 23 000 staff  2  3  4  Its main responsibility is to provide public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom  Channel Islands and Isle of Man  The BBC is an autonomous public service broadcaster 5  that operates under a Royal Charter 6  and a Licence and Agreement from the Home Secretary  7  Within the United Kingdom its work is funded principally by an annual television licence fee  8  which is charged to all British households  companies and organisations using any type of equipment to record and or receive live television broadcasts  9  the level of the fee is set annually by the British Government and agreed by Parliament  10  Outside the UK  the BBC World Service has provided services by direct broadcasting and re transmission contracts by sound radio since the inauguration of the BBC Empire Service in December 1932  and more recently by television and online  Though sharing some of the facilities of the domestic services  particularly for news and current affairs output  the World Service has a separate Managing Director  and its operating costs have historically been funded mainly by direct grants from the British government  These grants were determined independently of the domestic licence fee  A recent spending review has announced plans for the funding for the world service to be drawn from the domestic licence fee  The Corporation s  guaranteed  income from the licence fee and the World Service grants are supplemented by profits from commercial operations through a wholly owned subsidiary  BBC Worldwide Ltd  The company s activities include programme  and format sales  magazines including the Radio Times and book publishing  The BBC also earns additional income from selling certain programme making services through BBC Studios and Post Production Ltd   formerly BBC Resources Ltd  another wholly owned trading subsidiary of the corporation  The BBC is sometimes referred to as  Auntie  and  the Beeb   The former is also used to refer to the BBC s sister corporation  the Australian Broadcasting Corporation  Contents 1 History of the BBC 1 1 Post WW2 1 2 21st century 2

British Broadcasting Company The BBC coat of arms BBC Year Book 1931 BBC radio licences increase dramatically in 1929 1930  The privately owned BBC was the world s first national broadcasting organisation 11  and was founded on 18 October 1922 as the British Broadcasting Company Ltd  The original company was founded in 1922 12  by a group of six telecommunications companies Marconi  Radio Communication Company  Metropolitan Vickers  MetroVick   General Electric  Western Electric  and British Thomson Houston  BTH  13  to broadcast experimental radio services  The first transmission was on 14 November of that year  from station 2LO  located at Marconi House  London  14  The British Broadcasting Company Ltd was created by the British General Post Office  GPO  and John Reith applied for a job with the existing company and later became its employee general manager  The company was wound up and on 1 January 1927 15  a new non commercial entity called the British Broadcasting Corporation established under a Royal Charter became successor in interest  To represent its purpose and  stated  values  the Corporation adopted the coat of arms  including the motto  Nation shall speak peace unto Nation   The motto is generally attributed to Montague John Rendall  former headmaster of Winchester College  and member of the first BBC Board of Governors  16  The motto is said to be a  felicitous adaptation  of Micah 4  3  nation shall not lift up a sword against nation   17  Experimental television broadcasts were started in 1932 using an electromechanical 30 line system developed by John Logie Baird  Limited regular broadcasts using this system began in 1934  and an expanded service  now named the BBC Television Service  started from Alexandra Palace in 1936  alternating between an improved Baird mechanical 240 line system and the all electronic 405 line Marconi EMI system  The superiority of the electronic system saw the mechanical system dropped early the following year  18   edit  Post WW2 Television broadcasting was suspended from 1 September 1939 to 7 June 1946 during the Second World War  A widely reported urban myth is that  upon resumption of service  announcer Leslie Mitchell started by saying   As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted      In fact  the first person to appear when transmission resumed was Jasmine Bligh and the words said were  Good afternoon  everybody  How are you  Do you remember me  Jasmine Bligh       19  The European Broadcasting Union was formed on 12 February 1950  in Torquay with the BBC among the 23 founding broadcasting organisations  Competition to the BBC was introduced in 1955 with the commercial and independently operated television network of ITV  However  the BBC monopoly on radio services would persist into the 1970s  As a result of the Pilkington Committee report of 1962  in which the BBC was praised for the quality and range of its output  and ITV was very heavily criticised for not providing enough quality programming  20  the decision was taken to award the BBC a second television channel  BBC2  in 1964  renaming the existing service BBC1  BBC2 used the higher resolution 625 line standard which had been standardised across Europe  BBC2 was broadcast in colour from 1 July 1967  and was joined by BBC 1 and ITV on 15 November 1969  The 405 line VHF transmissions of BBC1  and ITV  were continued for compatibility with older television receivers until 1985  Starting in 1964 a series of pirate radio stations  starting with Radio Caroline  came on the air  and forced the British government finally to regulate radio services to permit nationally based advertising financed services  In response the BBC reorganised and renamed their radio channels  The Light Programme was split into Radio 1 offering continuous  Popular  music and Radio 2 more  Easy Listening   21  The  Third  programme became Radio 3 offering classical music and cultural programming  The Home Service became Radio 4 offering news  and non musical content such as quiz shows  readings  dramas and plays  As well as the four national channels  a series of local BBC radio stations were established in 1967  including Radio London  22  In 1974  the BBC s teletext service  Ceefax  was introduced  created initially to provide subtitling  but developed into a news and information service  In 1978 BBC staff went on strike just before the Christmas of that year  thus blocking out the transmission of both channels and amalgamating all four radio stations into one  23  24  Since the deregulation of the UK television and radio market in the 1980s  the BBC has faced increased competition from the commercial sector  and from the advertiser funded public service broadcaster Channel 4   especially on satellite television  cable television  and digital television services  citation needed  The BBC Research Department has played a major part in the development of broadcasting and recording techniques  In the early days it carried out essential research into acoustics and programme level and noise measurement  citation needed  The BBC was also responsible for the development of the NICAM stereo standard  In recent decades  a number of additional channels and radio stations have been launched  Radio 5 was launched in 1990 as a sports and educational station  but was replaced in 1994 with Radio 5 Live  following the success of the Radio 4 service to cover the 1991 Gulf War  The new station would be a news and sport station  In 1997  BBC News 24  a rolling news channel  launched on digital television services and the following year  BBC Choice launched as the third general entertainment channel from the BBC  The BBC also purchased The Parliamentary Channel  which was renamed BBC Parliament  In 1999  BBC Knowledge launched as a multi media channel  with services available on the newly launched BBC Text digital teletext service  and on BBC Online  The channel had an educational aim  which was modified later on in its life to offer documentaries   edit  21st century In 2002  a number of new channels and stations were made  BBC Knowledge was renamed BBC Four and became the BBC s arts and documentaries channel  In addition  CBBC  which had been a programming strand as Children s BBC since 1985  was split into CBBC and CBeebies with both new services getting a digital channel  the CBBC Channel and CBeebies Channel  In addition to the television channels  new digital radio stations were created  1Xtra  6 Music and BBC7  BBC 1Xtra was a sister station to Radio 1 and specialised in modern black music  BBC 6 Music specialised in alternative music genres and BBC7 specialised in archive  speech and children s programming  The following few years resulted in repositioning of some of the channels to conform to a larger brand  in 2003  BBC Choice became BBC Three  with programming for younger generations and shocking real life documentaries  BBC News 24 became the BBC News Channel in 2008  and BBC Radio 7 became BBC Radio 4 Extra in 2011  with new programmes to supplement those broadcast on Radio 4  In 2008 another channel was launched  BBC Alba  a Scottish Gaelic service  The 2004 Hutton Inquiry and the subsequent Report raised questions about the BBC s journalistic standards and its impartiality  This led to resignations of senior management members at the time including the then Director General  Greg Dyke  In January 2007  the BBC released minutes of the Board meeting which led to Greg Dyke s resignation  25  Unlike the other departments of the BBC  the BBC World Service is funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office  The Foreign and Commonwealth Office  more commonly known as the Foreign Office or the FCO  is the British government department responsible for promoting the interests of the United Kingdom abroad  In the past few years  the BBC has experimented in high definition television  In 2006  BBC HD launched as an experimental service  and became official in December 2007  The channel broadcasts HD simulcasts of programmes on BBC One  Two  Three and Four as well as repeats of some older programmes in HD  In 2010  a HD simulcast of BBC One launched  BBC One HD  The new channel uses HD versions of BBC One s schedule and uses upscaled versions of programmes not currently produced in HD  On 18 October 2007  BBC Director General Mark Thompson announced a controversial plan to make major cuts and reduce the size of the BBC as an organisation  The plans included a reduction in posts of 2 500  including 1 800 redundancies  consolidating news operations  reducing programming output by 10  and selling off the flagship Television Centre building in London  26  These plans have been fiercely opposed by unions  who have threatened a series of strikes  however the BBC have stated that the cuts are essential to move the organisation forward and concentrate on increasing the quality of programming  On 20 October 2010  the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced that the television licence fee would be frozen at its current level until the end of the current charter in 2016  The same announcement revealed that the BBC would take on the full cost of running the BBC World Service and the BBC Monitoring service from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office  and will part finance the Welsh broadcaster S4C  27  Further cuts were announced on 6 October 2011  so the BBC could reach a total reduction in their budget of 20   following the licence fee freeze in October 2010  Details include cutting staff by 2000 and sending a further 1000 to the MediaCityUK development  with BBC Three moving in 2016  the sharing of more programmes between stations and channels  sharing of radio news bulletins  more repeats in schedules  including the whole of BBC Two daytime and for some original programming to be reduced  Also  the BBC HD channel would be closed and replaced with an HD simulcast of BBC Two  however flagship programmes  other channels and full funding for CBBC and CBeebies would be retained  28  29  30   edit  Governance The BBC is a corporation  independent from direct government intervention  with its activities being overseen by the BBC Trust  formerly the Board of Governors   31  General management of the organisation is in the hands of a Director General  who is appointed by the Trust  he is the BBC s Editor in Chief and chairs the Executive Board  32   edit  Charter The BBC operates under a Royal Charter  6  with the current Charter having come into effect on 1 January 2007 and running until 31 December 2016  33  The Royal Charter is reviewed every 10 years  The 2007 Charter specifies that the

created the largest change in the governance of the Corporation since its inception  It abolished the sometimes controversial governing body  the Board of Governors  and replaced it with the BBC Trust and a formalised Executive Board  Under the Royal Charter  the BBC must obtain a licence from the Home Secretary  7  This licence is accompanied by an agreement which sets the terms and conditions under which BBC is allowed to broadcast  7  It was under this Licence and Agreement  and the Broadcasting Act 1981  that the Sinn F in broadcast ban from 1988 to 1994 was implemented  34  35   edit  BBC Trust Main article  BBC Trust The BBC Trust was formed on 1 January 2007  replacing the Board of Governors as the governing body of the Corporation  The Trust sets the strategy for the corporation  assesses the performance of the BBC Executive Board in delivering the BBC s services  and appoints the Director General  BBC Trustees are appointed by the British monarch on advice of government

English Regions and the BBC Global News division  The BBC North group includes all departments moving to MediaCityUK  It has organised the move  and contains departments such as BBC Sport  BBC Children s  BBC Radio 5 Live as well as some sections of BBC Learning  Many of the departments in this section belong to other departments too  such as BBC Radio 5 Live which is also part of BBC Audio  amp  Music  40  All aspects of the BBC fall into one or more of the above departments  with the following exceptions  The BBC Trust is separate from departments as it is part of their operation to monitor the operations and departments of the corporation  The other three departments are stand alone  due to their commercial nature  40  BBC Worldwide Ltd  operates international channels and exploits programme brands to gain addition income for BBC programmes  The BBC World News department is distributed by BBC Worldwide  but still separate  It has close links with the BBC News group  but is not governed by it  BBC Studios and Post Production is also separate and officially owns and operates some of the BBC s facilities  such as BBC Television Centre  40   edit  Finance The BBC has the second largest budget of any UK broadcaster with an operating expenditure of  4 26 billion in 2009 10 41  compared to  5 9 billion for British Sky Broadcasting  42   1 9 billion for ITV 43  and  214 million in 2007 for GCap Media  the largest commercial radio broadcaster   44   edit  Revenue See also  Television licence and Television licensing in the United Kingdom The principal means of funding the BBC is through the television licence  costing  145 50 per year per household  as of April 2010   Such a licence is required to receive broadcast television across Britain  however no licence is required to own a television used for other means  or for sound only radio sets  though a separate licence for these was also required for non TV households until 1971   The cost of a television licence is set by the government and enforced by the criminal law  A discount is available for households with only black and white television sets  A 50  discount is also offered to registered blind  45  The revenue is collected privately and is paid into the central government Consolidated Fund  a process defined in the Communications Act 2003  This TV Licensing collection is currently carried out by Capita  an outside agency  Funds are then allocated by the Department of Culture  Media and Sport  DCMS  and the Treasury and approved by Parliament via legislation  Additional revenues are paid by the Department for Work and Pensions to compensate for subsidised licences for eligible over 75 year olds  Income from commercial enterprises and from overseas sales of its catalogue of programmes has substantially increased over recent years  46  with BBC Worldwide contributing some  145 million to the BBC s core public service business  According to the BBC s 2009 2010 Annual Report 47  its income can be broken down  as follows   3 446 8 million in licence fees collected from householders   888 3 million from BBC Commercial Businesses   293 million from government grants   112 9 million from other income  such as providing content to overseas broadcasters and concert ticket sales  The licence fee has  however  attracted criticism  It has been argued that in an age of multi stream  multi channel availability  an obligation to pay a licence fee is no longer appropriate  The BBC s use of private sector company Capita Group to send letters to premises not paying the licence fee has been criticised  especially as there have been cases where such letters have been sent to premises which are up to date with their payments  or do not require a TV licence  48  The BBC uses an advertising campaign to inform customers of the requirement to pay the licence fee  These letters and adverts have been criticised by Conservative MPs Boris Johnson and Ann Widdecombe  for having a threatening nature and language used to scare evaders into paying  49  50  Audio clips and television broadcasts are used to inform listeners of the BBC s comprehensive database  51  There are a number of pressure groups campaigning on the issue of the licence fee  52   edit  Expenditure The following expenditure figures are from 2010 2011 and show expenditure per service  and major

to three of the ten BBC national radio networks  BBC Radio 3  BBC Radio 4  and BBC Radio 4 Extra  On the front of the building are statues of Prospero and Ariel  characters from William Shakespeare s play The Tempest  sculpted by Eric Gill  Renovation of Broadcasting House began in 2002 and is scheduled for completion in 2012  BBC Television and BBC News are currently based at BBC Television Centre a purpose built television facility and the second built in the country located in White City  London  This facility has been host to a number of famous guests and programmes through the years  and its name and image is familiar with many British citizens  Nearby  the BBC White City complex contains numerous programme offices  housed in Centre House  the Media Centre and Broadcast Centre  It is in this area around Shepherd s Bush that the majority of BBC employees work  As part of a major reorganisation of BBC property  the entire BBC News operation is expected to relocate from the News Centre at BBC Television Centre to the refurbished Broadcasting House to create what is being described as  one of the world s largest live broadcast centres   54  Following completion Broadcasting House will also be home to most of the BBC s national radio stations  and the BBC World Service  The major part of this plan involves the demolition of the two post war extensions to the building and construction of an extension 55  designed by Sir Richard MacCormac of MJP Architects  This move will concentrate the BBC s London operations  allowing them to sell Television Centre  which is expected to be completed by 2015  56  In addition to the scheme above  the BBC is in the process of making and producing more programmes outside of London  This involves producing more programmes at production centres such as Belfast  Glasgow and  most notably  Manchester  As part of the scheme  BBC North West is moving from New Broadcasting House  Oxford Road  to MediaCityUK in Salford  Joining them are the BBC Sports  BBC Children s  Radio 5 Live  BBC Breakfast and BBC Philharmonic departments and services from London  MediaCityUK will therefore become the biggest staffing operation outside London  57  58  As well as the two main sites in London  Broadcasting House and White City   there are seven other major BBC production centres in the UK  mainly specialising in different productions

December 2012  61  BBC One is a regionalised TV service which provides opt outs throughout the day for local news and other local programming  These variations are more pronounced in the BBC  Nations   i e  Northern Ireland  Scotland and Wales  where the presentation is mostly carried out locally on BBC One and Two  and where programme schedules can vary largely from that of the network  BBC Two variations exist in the Nations  however regions today rarely have the option to  opt out  as regional programming now only exists on BBC One  and regional opt outs are not possible in the regions that have already undertaken the switch to digital television  BBC Two was also the first channel to be transmitted on 625 lines in 1964  then carry a small scale regular colour service from 1967  BBC One would follow in November 1969  A new Scottish Gaelic television channel  BBC Alba  was launched in September 2008  It is also the first multi genre channel to come entirely from Scotland with almost all of its programmes made in Scotland  The service was initially only available via satellite but since June 2011 has been available to viewers in Scotland on Freeview and cable television  62  The BBC also has a HD channel  BBC HD  that launched on 9 June 2006 following a 12 month trial of the broadcasts  It became a proper channel in 2007  and screens HD programmes as simulcasts of the main network  or as repeats  The corporation has been producing programmes in the format for many years  and stated that it hoped to produce 100  of new programmes in HDTV by 2010  63  On 3 November 2010  a high definition simulcast of BBC One was launched  entitled BBC One HD  In the Republic of Ireland  Belgium  the Netherlands and Switzerland  the BBC channels are available in a number of ways  In these countries digital and cable operators carry a range of BBC channels these include BBC One  BBC Two and BBC World News  although viewers in the Republic of Ireland may receive BBC services via  overspill  from transmitters in Northern Ireland or Wales  or via  deflectors    transmitters in the Republic which rebroadcast broadcasts from the UK  received off air  or from digital satellite  Since 1975  the BBC has also provided its TV programmes to the British Forces Broadcasting Service  BFBS   allowing members of UK military serving abroad to watch and listen to them on two dedicated TV channels  Since 2008  all the BBC channels are available to watch online  either through the channel website  or through the BBC iPlayer service  This online streaming ability came about following experiments with live streaming  involving streaming certain channels in the UK  64   edit  Radio Weekly reach of the BBC s five national analogue radio stations 60  Further information  BBC Radio

its TV News service and BBC Guernsey and BBC Radio Jersey  These services are funded from locally collected licence fees  However  despite this  the BBC does not offer Local Radio for the Isle of Man

recent years  some services of the World Service have been reduced  the Thai service ended in 2006 67  as did the Eastern European languages  with resources diverted instead into the new BBC Arabic Television  68  Historically  the BBC was the only legal radio broadcaster based in the UK mainland until 1967  when University Radio York  URY   then under the name Radio York  was launched as the first  and now oldest  legal independent radio station in the country  However  the BBC did not enjoy a complete monopoly before this as several Continental stations  such as Radio Luxembourg  broadcast programmes in English to Britain since the 1930s and the Isle of Man based Manx Radio began in 1964  Today  the BBC still has some of the most popular Radio stations  with BBC Radio 2 being the most popular of the network and the most popular in the country  with 12 9 million weekly listeners in 2006  69  BBC Programming is also available to other services and in other countries  Since 1943  the BBC has provided radio programming to the British Forces Broadcasting Service  which broadcasts in countries where British troops are stationed  BBC Radio 1 is also carried in the United States and Canada on Sirius XM Radio  online streaming only   The BBC is a patron of The Radio Academy  70   edit  News Main article  BBC News BBC News is the largest broadcast news gathering operation in the world  71  providing services to BBC domestic radio as well as television networks such as the BBC News  BBC Parliament and BBC World News  In addition to this  news stories are available on the BBC Red Button service  Ceefax and BBC News Online  In addition to this  the BBC has been developing new ways to access BBC News  as a result has launched the service on BBC Mobile  making it accessible to mobile phones and PDAs  as well as developing alerts by e mail  digital television  and on computers through a desktop alert  Ratings figures suggest that during major crises such as the 7 July 2005 London bombings or a Royal Event  the UK audience overwhelmingly turns to the BBC s coverage as opposed to its commercial rivals  72  On 7 July 2005  the day that there were a series of coordinated bomb blasts on London s public transport system  the BBC Online website recorded an all time bandwidth peak of 11 Gb s at 12 00 on 7 July  BBC News received some 1 billion total hits on the day of the event  including all images  text and HTML   serving some 5 5 terabytes of data  At peak times during the day there were 40 000 page requests per second for the BBC News website  The previous day s announcement of the 2012 Olympics being awarded to London caused a peak of around 5 Gbit s  The previous all time high at BBC Online was caused by the announcement of the Michael Jackson verdict  which used 7 2 Gbit s  73   edit  Other media venues  edit  Internet Main article  BBC Online The BBC s online presence includes a comprehensive news website and archive  It was launched as BBC Online  before being renamed BBCi  then bbc co uk  before it was rebranded back as BBC Online  The website is funded by the Licence fee  but uses GeoIP technology  allowing advertisements to be carried on the site when viewed outside of the UK  74  The BBC claims the site to be  Europe s most popular content based site  75  and states that 13 2 million people in the UK visit the site s more than two million pages each day  76  According to Alexa s TrafficRank system  in July 2008 BBC Online was the 27th most popular English Language website in the world  77  and the 46th most popular overall  78  The centre of the website is the Homepage  which features a modular layout  Users can choose which modules  and which information  is displayed on their homepage  allowing the user to customise it  This system was first launched in December 2007  becoming permanent in February 2008  and has undergone a few aesthetical changes since then  79  The Homepage then has links to other micro sites  such as BBC News Online  Sport  Weather  TV and Radio  As part of the site  every programme on BBC Television or Radio is given its own page  with bigger programmes getting their own micro site  and as a result it is often common for viewers and listeners to be told website addresses  URLs  for the programme website  Another large part of the site also allows users to watch and listen to most Television and Radio output live and for seven days after broadcast using the BBC iPlayer platform  which launched on 27 July 2007  and initially used peer to peer and DRM technology to deliver both radio and TV content of the last seven days for offline use for up to 30 days  since then video is now streamed directly  Also  through participation in the Creative Archive Licence group  bbc co uk allowed legal downloads of selected archive material via the internet  80  The BBC has often included learning as part of its online service  running services such as BBC Jam  Learning Zone Class Clips and also runs services such as BBC WebWise and First Click which are designed to teach people how to use the internet  BBC Jam was a free online service  delivered through broadband and narrowband connections  providing high quality interactive resources designed to stimulate learning at home and at school  Initial content was made available in January 2006 however BBC Jam was suspended on 20 March 2007 due to allegations made to the European Commission that it was damaging the interests of the commercial sector of the industry  81  In recent years some major on line companies and politicians have complained that BBC Online receives too much funding from the television licence  meaning that other websites are unable to compete with the vast amount of advertising free on line content available on BBC Online  82  Some have proposed that the amount of licence fee money spent on BBC Online should be reduced either being replaced with funding from advertisements or subscriptions  or a reduction in the amount of content available on the site  83  In response to this the BBC carried out an investigation  and has now set in motion a plan to change the way it provides its online services  BBC Online will now attempt to fill in gaps in the market  and will guide users to other websites for currently existing market provision   For example  instead of providing local events information and timetables  users will be guided to outside websites already providing that information   Part of this plan included the BBC closing some of its websites  and rediverting money to redevelop other parts  84  85  On 26 February 2010 The Times claimed that Mark Thompson  Director General of the BBC  proposed that the BBC s web output should be cut by 50   with online staff numbers and budgets reduced by 25  in a bid to scale back BBC operations and allow commercial rivals more room  86  On 2 March 2010  the BBC reported that it will cut its website spending by 25  and close BBC 6 Music and Asian Network  as part of Mark Thompson s plans to make   a smaller  fitter BBC for the digital age   87  88   edit  Interactive television Main article  BBC Red Button BBC Red Button is the brand name for the BBC s interactive digital television services  which are available through Freeview  digital terrestrial   as well as Freesat  Sky  satellite   and Virgin Media  cable   Unlike Ceefax  the service s analogue counterpart  BBC Red Button is able to display full colour graphics  photographs  and video  as well as programmes and can be accessed from any BBC channel  The service carries News  Weather and Sport 24 hours a day  but also provides extra features related to programmes specific at that time  Examples include viewers to play along at home to gameshows  to give  voice and vote on opinions to issues  as used alongside programmes such as Question Time  At some points in the year  when multiple sporting events occur  some coverage of less mainstream sports or games are frequently placed on the Red Button for viewers to watch  Frequently  other features are added unrelated to programmes being broadcast at that time  such as the broadcast of the Doctor Who animated episode Dreamland in November 2009   edit  Commercial services BBC Worldwide Limited is the wholly owned commercial subsidiary of the BBC responsible

the NUJ and electrical staff by Unite  Union membership is optional  staff are not automatically covered by a union  and is paid for by staff members and not by the BBC   edit  Cultural significance Until the development  popularisation  and domination of television  radio was the broadcast medium upon which people in the United Kingdom relied  It  reached into every home in the land  and simultaneously united the nation  an important factor during the Second World War   91  The BBC introduced the world s first  high definition  405 line television service in 1936  and apart from suspending service throughout World War II until 1946  was the only television broadcaster in the UK until 1955   The BBC s monopoly was broken in 1955  with the introduction of Independent Television  ITV    92  This heralded the transformation of television into a popular and dominant medium  Nevertheless   throughout the 1950s radio still remained the dominant source of broadcast comedy   92  Further  the BBC was the only legal radio broadcaster until 1968  when URY obtained their first licence   93  Even since the advent of commercial television and radio  the BBC has remained one of the main elements in British popular culture through its obligation to produce TV and radio programmes for mass audiences  citation needed  However  the arrival of BBC2 allowed the BBC also to make programmes for minority interests in drama  documentaries  current affairs  entertainment and sport  Examples are cited such as I  Claudius  Civilisation  Tonight  Monty Python s Flying Circus  Doctor Who and Pot Black  but other examples can be given in each of these fields as shown by the BBC s entries in the British Film Institute s 2000 list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes  94  The export of BBC programmes through both services like the BBC World Service and BBC World News  as well as the channels operated by BBC Worldwide mean that BBC productions can now be experienced worldwide  The term BBC English  Received Pronunciation  refers to the former use of Standard English with this accent  However  the organisation now makes more use of regional accents in order to reflect the diversity of the UK  though clarity and fluency are still expected of presenters  95  From its  starchy  beginnings  the BBC has also become more inclusive  and now attempts to accommodate the interests of all strata of society and all minorities  because they all pay the licence fee  96  Competition from Independent Television  Channel 4  Sky and other broadcast television stations  has lessened the BBC s influence  but such public broadcasting remains a major influence on British popular culture  97   edit  Attitudes toward the BBC in popular culture Older domestic UK audiences often refer to the BBC as  the Beeb   a nickname originally dubbed by Peter Sellers in The Goon Show in the 1950s  when he referred to the  Beeb Beeb Ceeb   It was then borrowed  shortened and popularised by Kenny Everett  98  Another nickname  now less commonly used  is  Auntie   said to originate from the old fashioned  Auntie knows best  attitude  but possibly a sly reference to the  aunties  and  uncles  who were presenters of children s programmes in early days  99  in the days when John Reith  the BBC s first director general  was in charge  The two nicknames have also been used together as  Auntie Beeb   100  and Auntie has been used in out take programmes such as Auntie s Bloomers  101   edit  Criticism and controversies Main articles  BBC controversies and Criticism
