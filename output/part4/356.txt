Further reading 10 External links  edit  Publication history Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created the Beast  Stan Lee writes in the foreword to X Men  The Ultimate Guide that he made Beast the most articulate  eloquent  and well read of the X Men to contrast with his brutish exterior  Further  the book opines that the Werner Roth Roy Thomas team garnered admiration for their  appealing and sensitive characterizations of the original X Men   Roth  under the alias Jay Gavin  had taken over for Kirby fully by issue  18 and Thomas was a new talent  Beast was given an individualized  colorful new costume with the rest of the X Men by issue  39 in order to attract new readers  After Jim Steranko s tenure  which added  exciting art   Roth returned  working with Neal Adams who blended Kirby s style with  realism  idealized beauty  and epic grandeur   making The X Men  later named Uncanny X Men  series one of the most popular superhero comics by the late 1960s  In Amazing Adventures  11  written by Gerry Conway in March 1972  the Beast underwent a radical change in appearance  mutating into the now familiar furry creature  The concept originated with Roy Thomas  an effort to make the character more visibly striking  and Beast also became more werewolf like to capitalize on the success of Werewolf by Night  2  Steranko reasons   he had to expand beyond simply using big words   2  Over the next decade he would appear on the roster of several teams in titles ranging from Avengers to Defenders to X Factor  It wasn t until 1991  in X Factor  70 X Men  1  that the Beast finally returned to the X Men  In Uncanny X Men  390  2001  the Beast cured the Legacy Virus and in X Treme X Men  3  2001  the Beast experienced a further mutation into a feline being  first shown in the introduction to New X Men  June  2001   by Frank Quitely and Grant Morrison  As evidenced on the back cover of X Treme X Men Vol  1  Chris Claremont  writer of that series in addition to both Uncanny X Men  for sixteen consecutive years  and X Factor  contributed much to the Beast s characterization  Citing Claremont as inspiration for his run on New X Men  Morrison explains Beast as a  brilliant  witty bipolar scientist   Morrison continues   I saw Henry McCoy as an incredibly clever  witty  cultured  well traveled  experienced  well read character so I brought out those parts of his personality which seemed to me to fit the profiles of the smartest and most worldly people I know   his sense of humor is dark and oblique  He s obviously quite clearly bipolar and swings between manic excitement and ghastly self doubt  He has no dark secrets  however  and nothing to hide   3 Joss Whedon s Astonishing X Men  Gifted story arc featured a  mutant cure  designed by Indian Benetech scientist Dr  Kavita Rao  and the prospect of  real  humanity arouses the interest of a heavily mutated Beast  who visits Rao only to discover that the drug is the product of illegal human experimentation on an unknown victim  The idea of a mutant cure  which had previously appeared in the 1992 animated series  was also the basis of the X Men  The Last Stand movie plot and the series was even made into a motion comic  IGN called the arc focusing on Beast  best X Men run in a decade  and lauded Whedon for flawless character dynamics  4  According to BusinessWeek  the Beast is listed as one of the top ten most intelligent fictional characters in American comics  5   edit  Fictional character biography Henry Philip McCoy was born in Dundee  Illinois  in the United States  to Norton and Edna McCoy  His father  Norton McCoy  is employed at a local nuclear power plant before Henry s birth and was once exposed to intense nuclear radiation  which appears to have caused his son s mutation  Hank is born with a vast intellect  unusually long arms and legs  and unusually large hands and feet for a human  in fact  his body s proportions are comparable to those of a gorilla and later stories reveal his nickname in school was  Magilla Gorilla    edit  With the X Men Detail of cover to X Men  vol  1   8  Art by Jack Kirby  Henry s mutation more fully manifests during adolescence  providing greater strength and agility  and although his powers allow him to briefly excel in athletics during his remaining time at school  he soon attracts the animosity of his fellow students and other non mutant humans  As he seeks refuge  he is approached by Professor Charles Xavier  who invites him to study at  Xavier s School for Gifted Youngsters   Henry recognizes the opportunities such an institution can offer him and accepts the invitation  He finds the school both a fountain of scientific knowledge and a place of sanctuary and is there introduced to the X Men  who accept him into their ranks and give him the codename Beast  Alongside workouts in the Danger Room  under Xavier s tutelage  he studies subjects ranging from differential equations to Proust  With the rest of the X Men on their first field mission  he battles Magneto for the first time  6  and later Magneto s Brotherhood of Evil Mutants  7  He briefly left the team  but returned after meeting Unus the untouchable  8  With the team  he also visits the Savage Land  and meets Ka Zar  9  Hank even battles the Juggernaut but is badly hurt  10  He then fights the Sentinels with the X Men  11  In addition  he and Iceman fight the Maha Yogi  12  Hank later recounts his clash with the Conquistador and how he joined the X Men  13   edit  After the X Men Detail of cover of X Men vol  2  1  1991   Art by Jim Lee  Hank leaves the X Men shortly after his twentieth birthday  after remarking that he is no longer one of the  strangest teens of all   He becomes a research scientist at the Brand Corporation  a genetics research facility  His assistant  Linda Donaldson  quickly becomes his girlfriend  Hank isolates a  hormonal extract  allowing anyone to become a mutant for a short period of time  and uses the mutagenic serum on himself to disguise his appearance while foiling an attempt to steal his research  14  However  he waits too long to reverse the process  leaving him permanently transformed  He has grown gray fur  which later turns blue  all over his body and acquired sharp ears  elongated canine teeth  claws  the ability to run on walls and ceilings like a spider  enhanced senses  an accelerated healing factor  and a feral side he struggles to control  He briefly joins the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants when Mastermind wipes out his memory  but quickly recovers  When the Beast is wounded  he is aided by Patsy Walker  and then reunited with his old girlfriend  Vera Cantor  15  Back at Brand Laboratories  he discovers his girlfriend Linda Donaldson is a Communist spy  and they break up   edit  With the Avengers Not long after this transformation  he is recruited to join the Avengers as a provisional member  16  He is later granted full Avengers membership 17  and remains a member for many years  becoming a close friend of Wonder Man  He leaves the team periodically to rejoin the X Men during times of need  such as The Dark Phoenix Saga 18    He returns to the Avengers each time  but eventually leaves so that the team  which has a six member limit at the time  can be filled out by new recruits  19   edit  With the Defenders He later joins the Defenders  20  stays with the team to organize as the  new  Defenders  21  and is one of the final surviving members at the time of its first disbandment as a result of the battle with Moondragon and the Dragon of the Moon  22  He and fellow surviving Defenders Angel and Iceman are contacted shortly after by Cyclops and Jean Grey to form a new group  X Factor  23   edit  With X Factor With X Factor  he rejoins the original members of the X Men  and is again reunited with Vera Cantor  Beast starts out in his furred form  but on their second mission  he is captured by Tower  He is delivered to Carl Maddicks and used in an attempt to develop a cure for mutancy  which has rendered Maddicks  son  Artie  mute  Maddicks develops a serum and tests it on Beast  Hank is also subjected to chemotherapy and radiation  and suffers a cardiac arrest  X Factor arrives on the scene and saves Hank  but not before he s been injected with the serum  When the bandages around his face are removed  he is revealed to have lost his blue fur  24  This helps in X Factor s cover as normal humans who are mutant hunters for hire  though they actually help the mutants they capture   When they see the need for their powers  they don new costumes similar to their old X Men costumes  and call themselves the X Terminators  posing as renegade mutants  Beast wears a mask as he did originally  since he now looks human again  Eventually X Factor clashes with the ancient mutant Apocalypse 25  after Angel loses his wings in a battle and shortly after goes missing  Apocalypse turns Angel into Death  the most powerful of his four Horsemen of Apocalypse  During the battle  Beast is touched by the Horseman Pestilence  whose touch usually causes incredible pain and viral infection  The infection interacts with the recent serum treatment of Maddicks  and instead of killing him  Hank is affected in such a way that every time he uses his superhuman strength  his intelligence decreases  26  Though the battle is won  it comes at the cost of Hank s decreasing intelligence and Angel s humanity  which would not return for a time  Hank s condition worsens for weeks  He even openly talks to Trish Tilby  a reporter  not realizing she might use the information on TV  Out of respect for Hank s situation  Trish does not mention his name when she reports about X Factor s recent battles  only that one of them lost his intellect while heroically defending New York  The Beast is still hurt by her using the information at all  but she is able to convince him that she meant well  X Factor finally ends their charade and are hailed as heroes  and they then don costumes similar to their previous X Terminator costumes  When Hank s mind is nothing more than that of a child  he intercepts a mutant called Infectia who is trying to kiss Iceman  Infectia has the ability to manipulate molecular structures through touch  creating mutated  monsters   When she kisses Beast  he becomes feverish and begins switching back and forth between his normal and furred forms  27  Finally  he stabilizes in his furry appearance  keeps his intelligence  and has more strength than ever  28  Hank soon resumes wearing his old costume  but now no longer has need for a mask  During the events of Inferno  Beast  along with the rest of X Factor team up with the X Men and various other heroes to fight the evil forces invading the city  eventually  they manage to stop a portal between Limbo and Earth from remaining open and peace returns for the survivors  29  Soon after Inferno ends  the X Tinction Agenda takes place where Genosha wants to punish various mutants for war crimes on their island  Here  Beast plays yet another key role  Shortly after the crisis ends  X Factor switches costumes once more  Cyclops  Jean  and Iceman all wear identical costumes  while Beast returns to wearing trunks  and Archangel sticks to his old costume he received from Apocalypse  30  Towards the end of X Factor s career  they battle the Shadow King during the Muir Island Saga  The final battle leaves Professor Xavier crippled again  which results in X Factor rejoining the X Men  31   edit  Back with the X Men One of Beast s greatest challenges emerges with Stryfe s fatal Legacy Virus  Hank is already despondent  as he is turning thirty and questions his life accomplishments  His frustrations are further compounded when Professor Xavier and Moira MacTaggert don t ask for his assistance with the Legacy research  but it turns out Xavier is just giving him his privacy  Perusing their data  Hank learns the problem is more difficult than he had initially imagined  Hank has always believed that  given time  he could solve any problem  the Legacy Virus becomes his obsession  He goes as far as making an unethical decision in giving Mister Sinister information on the virus  since he has more resources and fewer morals to inhibit him  volume  amp  issue needed  A turning point comes when Dark Beast finishes some of the formula  occasionally prying more information from Hank whom he imprisons and replaces for a while  The most critical step toward a solution  other than when Beast individually finds the cure without acknowledgement  comes when Dr  MacTaggert discovers Mystique s irresponsible manipulation of a virus strand  However  the cure is incomplete and it takes Beast to design the final cure  Based on Moira s notes  Beast concocts the anti virus to much elation  but it soon is repaid with a heavy toll Colossus chooses to sacrifice his life to release the remedy  volume  amp  issue needed  After mourning the loss of a teammate  Hank briefly leaves the school with Storm and her X Treme X Men team in search of Destiny s diaries  After an attack by Vargas that leaves Psylocke dead  Beast is gravely injured and returns to the Institute   edit  New X Men Cover art for New X Men  117  depicting Beast s feline form  Art by Frank Quitely  As the world experiences a mutant baby boom  much of the mutant community seemingly begins experiencing  secondary mutations   often taking the form of additional or enhanced abilities  In the aftermath of Vargas  attack  Beast s secondary mutation is  jumpstarted  due to the powers of fellow teammate Sage  The further mutation causes Beast to develop a more feline physique  to which he initially has some trouble adapting  A psychic attack by the genocidal Cassandra Nova leaves Beast humiliated  badly beaten  by the controlled body of his friend Beak  and haunted by the possibility that his new form is simply a step in a continuous state of devolution  Additionally  the alteration in form causes his long time girlfriend  Trish Tilby  to break up with him after being accused of bestiality in the media  Over time  Beast strikes up a strong friendship with Emma Frost  in one incident bringing her flowers to cheer her up  He finds her diamond form shattered into thousands of pieces and spends some time putting her back together  With a final jolt of psionic energy from Jean Grey  Frost returns to life  Beast later uncovers what seems to be a female mutant with feline features  like his situation  This raises hopes for him  until he discovers it s not a mutant female that looks like a cat  it s a mutant cat who looks like a human  Either way  the creature is at the limit of her life and Beast allows her to leave the X Mansion to pass away quietly in a spot she finds comfortable  When news of a  cure  that would reverse mutations suddenly arises  Beast finds himself seriously considering taking it so he can once again appear human  Hank eventually decides against it after vigorous  urging  by fellow team member Wolverine  as it would send out a negative message to other mutants if an X Man were to take the cure  After learning that the cure was developed by fellow geneticist Kavita Rao through experimentation on mutant corpses   as well as on the X Man Colossus   Beast helps take down Rao s operation  When the villainous Hellfire Club attacks the X Men  Cassandra Nova telepathically strips away Beast s higher human consciousness  leaving him with only his animal instincts  After hunting Wolverine around campus  and even eating his leg   a student named Blindfold faces him down with a device he and Xavier had built in case his consciousness was ever lost  The device is a high powered sensory stimulant in the form of a ball of string  which Beast had alluded to as being his greatest fear  Once restored  he is quick to put on a suit and tie and help Wolverine with a hyper magnetic device  He  along with his teammates  are taken from the Mansion by the government agency S W O R D  and airlifted to the alien Breakworld   edit  Civil War When a Civil War breaks out among Marvel s superheroes  Beast  along with the other X Men  assumes a neutral stance  However  Beast was not a particular fan of the policy and secretly violates his stance by providing Spider Man with a holographic disguise to enable him to continue teaching at Midtown High after his secret identity has been exposed  32  Despite his personal feelings about the Superhuman Registration Act  Beast enlists his services to the Initiative program after the war s end  to assist in the training of the next generation of superheroes  33   edit  Endangered Species The X Men and various other mutants attend the funeral of a young mutant boy named Matt Landru who has been killed in a road traffic accident and muse on what this means for mutant kind  Beast plans to find a way to reverse M Day  Despite the  aid  of his other self

is among the first to reach Professor Xavier after he is accidentally shot by Bishop  Xavier s body soon disappears  In the aftermath  Cyclops has sent Beast to search for Professor Xavier  whose status is unknown by the X Men  He is also seen closing down the ruins of the X Mansion and taking Martha Johansson with him  35   edit  Manifest Destiny Beast is seen as part of the team setting up a

and methods  such as allowing Magneto to become a member to his time under torture under the Dark Beast  45  This resulted in Beast leaving the X Men  46  After leaving the X Men  Beast opted to join

possesses neotenous characteristics  50  which may explain him having a super genius intellect despite his animal physique  He possesses also superhuman strength  speed and agility  He is an excellent hand to hand combatant  employing a unique style of acrobatic combat  from combat training he received at Professor Xavier s and coaching from Captain America   edit  Anthropoid Simian physique Originally  Hank McCoy retains the basic features of a normal human alongside a generally simian physiology  e g   elongated limbs and enlarged extremities  equivalent to that of a Great Ape  This mutation gives him superhuman strength  speed  reflexes  agility  flexibility  dexterity  coordination  balance  and endurance  He is equally dexterous with all four limbs  able to perform tasks with his feet or hands with equal ease  Because of his talents and training  Beast can outperform any Olympic level athlete  contorting his body and performing aerial feats gracefully  His strength and dexterity allow him to climb vertical surfaces with just his hands and or feet  51  jump great distances  52  and survive falls that would kill any ordinary person  53  He also possesses enhanced senses and can track people for great distances over open terrain  54  and his feet are sensitive enough to detect electronic signals  from bombs  listening devices  etc   through solid walls and floors  55  Later  Hank mutated further  from drinking an experimental solution of his own making  through the growth of grey fur covering his entire body and the enhancement of all of his existing abilities  especially his strength  and he also gained a nearly instantaneous healing factor  56  The psychological impact of this first transformation caused Beast to experience short term amnesia and also made it difficult for him to control his animalistic instincts  which would cause him to slip into an uncontrollable berserker rage during combat  57  However  his body suddenly mutated again after a short time  changing his fur color from grey to black  although comic book printing technology depicted it as blue   returning his strength back to previous levels  and losing his healing factor  58  He was also able to more easily control his animal instincts after this second mutation  Beast gained the ability to emit mood altering pheromones  causing sexual attraction in women  citation needed  During this time he was occasionally depicted with claws and fangs  but these were not a part of his original mutation  58  Hank McCoy briefly returned to his humanoid simian form  59  with his hair color now being depicted as black  not reddish brown  However  as a result of being touched by Pestilence his strength began to increase exponentially while his intellect began to decrease  60  After Infectia s kiss restored Hank to his simian physique  his intellect had stabilized and returned to his previous genius level  and his strength had increased to superhuman proportions  61  Beast s fangs and claws became a consistent part of his appearance after this return to his  blue and furry  form   edit  Feline physique After being critically wounded  62  Hank s body undergoes a secondary mutation  jump started by Sage  The result is a more feline appearance equivalent to that of a big cat  His strength  speed  stamina  sturdiness  and senses increase further with this change  He gains cat like agility  flexibility  coordination  and balance  and all his senses are enhanced to twenty times that of a normal human being  In addition  Beast develops an accelerated healing factor that allows him to repair mild to moderate injuries within the span of a few hours  However  as his hands and feet change from simian to feline  going from a normal human set of four fingers to just three  retaining the opposable thumb   he loses his superhuman dexterity  once admitting that he used to play the guitar  but is now learning to play the drums instead  Following the X Men s relocation to San Francisco  Beast discovers that he had regained some of his old manual dexterity  In the first issue of Warren Ellis  Astonishing X Men run  Beast also comments he no longer needs full sleep   edit  Genius intellect Hank possesses a brilliant intellect  He is a world renowned biochemist  having earned a Ph D  in biophysics and genetics  63  and is the man who

Professor X  Moira McTaggert  and Kavita Rao  Despite this  he has never received a Nobel Prize or been elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences  A Renaissance man  McCoy is well versed in many fields including languages  fluent in English  German  French  Latin  Spanish  Japanese  Arabic  and Russian as well as the fictional language Latverian 19    literature  philosophy  psychology  and sociology  history  art and art history  anthropology  linguistics  and music  as well as in political science and economics with a special affinity for science and technology and a

settings  He has made several deus ex machina devices on par with Reed Richards  including a device that strips entities of cosmic powers   edit  Similarities According to writer Will Murray  a possible inspiration for the Beast was Andrew Blodgett  Monk  Mayfair  a companion of pulp hero Doc Savage  Both are possessed of an apelike appearance and are brilliant scientists  Before becoming more erudite in later issues  McCoy also used a great deal of slang in his early appearances much like Monk  64   edit  Other versions Main article  Alternative versions of Beast  edit  In other media
