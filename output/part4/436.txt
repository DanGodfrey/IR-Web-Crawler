Transformers  Marvel Comics  Autobot leader Optimus Prime battles Decepticon leader Megatron  From issue  2 of The Transformers comic series published by Marvel Comics  The Transformers comic by Marvel was the first and arguably the best known Transformers comic  Although it was originally intended to be a 4 issue limited series  it expanded into an ongoing series  which ran for 80 issues before being cancelled  1  The final cover read  80 in a 4 issue limited series   Issues  5 15  17 32  35 42 and 44 56 were written by Bob Budiansky  with Marvel UK writer Simon Furman taking over for the remainder of the comic  The comic did not attempt to follow the show and some elements and characters were completely absent  Most notably was the absence of characters from season 3 like Ultra Magnus  Springer  Arcee  Metroplex and the Quintessons  with the exception of a stand alone issue which adapted  The Big Broadcast of 2006    The comic started much the same as the show  a crew crash landing the Ark on Earth in the distant past  They are befriended by Buster Witwicky  His brother Spike eventually joins the cause as Autobot leader when he became the head of commander Fortress Maximus  There occurs a considerable amount of fractioning and in fighting in both the Autobots and Decepticons  However the series climax occurs when both sides  Autobots and Decepticons  form an uneasy peace to defend Cybertron from Unicron  Simon Furman himself says the final issues of the US Transformers comic are his favourite  citation needed  A few of the early issues were reprinted by Marvel in a digest sized magazine called The Transformers Comics Magazine that ran 10 issues from 1987 1988  2  Marvel had also reprinted some of these early issues in 1985  as the Transformers Collected Comics which ran 2 issues  3  4  In latter years  when various other companies were able to obtain the license for the Transformers  they were able to gain access to the Marvel series and reprinted a lot of the issues  From 2001 2003  Titan Books reprinted numerous Marvel issues in a series of 14 trade paperbacks  5  Years later they were able to do more reprints but only in the U K market  6  IDW Publishing  the current rights holders to the Transformers comic property  reprinted numerous Marvel issues as well  as part of the Transformers  Generations series that ran 12 issues 7  and a collected trade paperback from 2006 2007  8  Issues were also reprinted in The Transformers Magazine  that ran four issues 9  in 2007  while other collections were published  most notably the Classic Transformers collections  in 2008 and 2009  10  IDW began publishing another new series of reprints called Transformers Classics  This three volume series started getting published in June 2011 11   Meanwhile a 100 Penny Press  Transformers Classics  1 mini edition was also published in June 2011  12  Some issues were also reprinted in the hardcover book Transformers  The Best Of Simon Furman in July 2007  13   edit  Marvel UK Dinobots leader Grimlock battles Decepticon Shockwave  From issue  262 of the Transformers comic published by Marvel UK  The sister title in the UK  this series ran for 332 issues  14  as well as spawning 7 annuals and 28 specials  15  It was a weekly publication that spliced original stories into the continuity of the reprinted US issues  and was mostly written by Simon Furman  At the start  it had a more serious science fiction approach  Because of the weekly approach  the UK comic was able to flesh out characters and ideas more  in the US comic  the Aerialbots and Stunticons are first shown having just been built and being given life by the Creation Matrix program  whereas the UK comic fleshed it out more and showed the two teams as being created out of new technology created by Shockwave after scanning Buster Witwicky while he had the Matrix downloaded into his brain  Furman also tried to maintain continuity with The Transformers  The Movie  and wrote several stories set in the future after the movie s ending  as well as bringing characters from the future  i e  Galvatron  into the present day  Due to his epic and mythological approach  he was highly praised and succeeded Bob Budiansky on the US title at issue 56  The mythic tone continued to influence Furman s work on the Dreamwave and IDW comics  Numerous issues and stories from this series would eventually be reprinted  Marvel UK themselves would reprint some stories in Transformers The Complete Works Part 1 and Part 2  Plague of the Insecticons and The Transformers Universe Vol  One  15  In latter years reprints were done courtesy of Titan Books who published reprints in 14 volumes  5  When IDW Publishing acquired the licence to the property  they published various reprints in the hardcover book The Best Of Simon Furman and in the Best of UK Omnibus  13  Other reprints were featured in mini series collections such as Target 2006   1 5   Dinobots   1 6   Space Pirates   1 5   Time Wars   1 5   City of Fear   1 5   and Prey   1 5   16  A new 8 volume reprint collection called Transformers Classics  UK started getting released in October 2011  17  Main article  List of Transformers UK Comics  edit  G I  Joe and The Transformers  Marvel  U S   1986 Autobot Bumblebee is mistakenly blown up by forces of G I  Joe  From issue  1 of the G I  Joe and the Transformers mini series published by Marvel Comics  A four issue limited series written by Michael Higgins  18  which teamed up the Transformers with the other popular Hasbro property of the 1980s  G I  Joe  The Joes  the Autobots  and Cobra  after being betrayed by the Decepticons  must join forces to stop the Decepticons from activating an energy drill device to suck up energy from the Earth s core  which would destroy the planet in the process  The story was hampered by continuity issues  though the storyline was only referenced in the pages of the Transformers comics  as G I  Joe writer Larry Hama opted to ignore the mini series   and the absence of several key characters from both franchises  most notably Cobra Commander  Optimus Prime  and Megatron as the three characters were presumed dead at the time of the mini series  publication  The series does have some importance towards it though  as the story featured Bumblebee being destroyed by G I  Joe forces and rebuilt as Goldbug  a plot point that is ignored in the UK comic  where the story was not reprinted until much later in the comic s run  and resulted in an alternate story being conceived to transition the character into his  Goldbug  persona   The series was reprinted as a trade paperback in 1993  19  Marvel UK also featured a crossover between these two properties  Rather than a separate miniseries  the Transformers simply appeared within the pages of the G I  Joe comic series  which was called Action Force in England   The story occurred in Action Force issues  24  27  20   edit  The Transformers  Headmasters  Marvel  U S   1987 1988 Autobot Fortress Maximus removes his own head while on the planet Nebulos  From issue  1 of the The Transformers  Headmasters mini series published by Marvel Comics  A four issue mini series 21  introducing new characters that were incorporated into the ongoing series  issue  38  at the conclusion of the mini series  The series introduces the Headmasters  Targetmasters  some of the movie Transformers  Monsterbots  Horrorcons  Technobots and Terrorcons  The plot of this series focuses on Cybertronian Autobot Fortress Maximus  who despite his success as a military commander  longs to find peace by leaving Cybertron s civil war altogether  To that end  he gathers a large crew of followers  and they rocket off to the planet Nebulos  which has not seen war in over 10 000 years  Unfortunately  the Autobots  first encounters with the Nebulans are misinterpreted  Intimidated by the robots  size  the Nebulans initiate aggressions against the Autobots  To end hostilities and show his willingness to protect the planet s fragile peace  Fortress Maximus and a few of his followers discard their weapons in front of the Nebulan capital  When that failed to dissuade them  he made the ultimate sacrifice by offering them his head  Four more Autobots did the same  while the remained returned to their camp unarmed  Intending to use the situation to his advantage  corrupt Nebulan politician Lord Zarak learned more about the Autobots and the war they left behind and used this information to contact Cybertron  Zarak s message was received by Fortress Maximus s Decepticon equal  Scorponok  After lying to Zarak about the intentions of the Autobots  Scorponok led an invasion force to the planet  Armed only with weapons that had not seen use in millennia  the Nebulan defense were no match for the intentionally aggressive Decepticons  With little options left  Galen  leader of the Nebulan world council  made arrangements for himself and others to become Autobot Headmasters  Although the Headmaster process made them able to drive of the Decepticons  all Galen had succeeded in doing was re igniting the Transformers  war on Nebulous  After Scorponok and now captive Lord Zarak developed a way to duplicate the process  as well as a later Targetmaster Process   the Nebulos theatre of the Transformers  war escalated  After casualties and collateral damage mounted  Galen eventually convinced Zarak to take their conflict off world  with nearly all Transformers from both factions following a distress beacon sent by Goldbug from Earth  Because the was bi monthly  very little time passed after its end before a smaller group returned to Nebulos  using resources there and the Powermaster Process to rebuild and empower Optimus Prime  The entire miniseries was reprinted by Titan Books as part of their series of trade paperback collections based on the Marvel series  This reprint occurred in Vol 7  Trial by Fire  which was published in 2005  5   edit  The Transformers  The Movie  Marvel  U S   1986 A three issue mini series adaptation of the feature film  22  with no continuity ties to the regular comic series  Differences to the animated feature include the original designs for the Autobot Matrix of Leadership and Ultra Magnus  original death at the hand of Scourge and his Sweeps   edit  Transformers Universe  Marvel  U S   1986 A four issue limited series 23  in the style of Marvel Universe and G I  Joe  Order of the Battle  featuring lengthy bios of nearly all of the Transformers of the period  Most of the text was the same as the tech specs found on the toy boxes  only much more expanded  The first three issues  as well as the first portion of the fourth  contained all of the first  second and third year Transformers  The latter half of the fourth issue dealt with characters new to The Transformers  The Movie  1986   including characters that were not made as toys at the time  The series was collected as a trade paperback in July 1987  24   edit  Transformers Generation 2  Marvel  U S   1993 Main article  Transformers  Generation 2  comic  Autobot leader Optimus Prime battles Decepticon Jhiaxus  From issue  3 of the Transformers  Generation 2 comic series published by Marvel Comics  A 12 issue series  25  the series expanded the original G1 mythos from the small war on Earth and Cybertron to enclose the whole of the Galaxy that was fast being altered into a likeness of Cybertron itself by the Cybertronian Empire  a race of later generation Transformers that evolved while the earthbound Autobots and Decepticons were deactivated  The events of this series were actually set in motion with a crossover from the G I  Joe comic books  138 142  26  in 1993  Megatron returns in his new tank body to reclaim his leadership from Bludgeon and by the end of the series joins with Optimus Prime to fight against the G2 Decepticons and their genetic offshoot  the Swarm  The series ended with an epic battle between the  Generation 1  Transformers  the Cybertronians and the Swarm  It also introduces the Liege Maximo  However  the series was cancelled with issue  12 due to low sales  forcing a quick conclusion to the series  various plot threads  Outside of the 12 issue series  Marvel published a free 8 page comic that was given away at various stores selling the G2 toyline called The Transformers Generation 2  Halloween Special Edition in 1993  27  The series was reprinted as 2 trade paperbacks courtesy of Titan Books in 2003  5  As well some stories were reprinted in the hardcover book Transformers  The Best Of Simon Furman in July 2007  13  As they had done with the Generation 1 series  Marvel published a series based on Generation 2 in England  Because their Marvel UK imprint had folded at this point  Marvel struck a deal with the British comic company Fleetway to handle the series in the English market for them  28  The series only lasted 5 issues 29  as well as one annual in 1995  30   edit  New Avengers Transformers Main article  New Avengers Transformers A crossover with the original holders of the Transformers license  Marvel Comics  this series takes place in both Marvel s ongoing continuity   pre Civil War   and IDW s G1 continuity  set in between Infiltration and Escalation  The 4 issue series 31  is written by Stuart Moore and drawn by Tyler Kirkman  32 Captain America  Iron Man  Wolverine  and Spider Man all appear  as well as many of the Transformers cast of Escalation  33  The series was collected as a trade paperback in January 2008  34   edit  Note The Marvel Comics character Death s Head  a character created by Simon Furman  appeared in certain Marvel UK Transformers stories  In the third issue of the All New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A Z  released on March 22  2006   the entry for Death s Head s describes his encounters with the Transformers to have taken place in an alternate reality  referred to as Earth 120185  thus separating these stories from existence in standard Marvel Universe continuity  This raises the question of whether or not any of the Marvel Comics Transformers stories take place in the Marvel Universe  proper   Earth 616   despite such tie ins as Spider Man s guest starring appearance in the original Marvel limited series and Circuit Breaker  a character that originated in the Transformers comics  having a cameo appearance in Marvel s Secret Wars II limited series  which featured nearly every character then existing in the continuity of Earth 616  A case can be made that only the stories that featured Death s Head are separate from standard Marvel continuity  since the character s adventures often involved travel across time and dimensions  not to mention genres  Death s Head also encountered the British science fiction icon the Doctor from Doctor Who on occasion   edit  Dreamwave Productions In early 2002  Dreamwave Productions acquired the Transformers comics license and went on to produce a highly successful return of Transformers to the comic world  They started with a limited series focusing on the Generation 1 characters and a monthly series dedicated to Transformers  Armada  The G1 stories were not bound by the previous Marvel stories nor the animated series  Dreamwave produced a large amount of material  but would go bankrupt and lose the Transformers license in early 2005   edit  Generation 1  edit  Transformers  Generation 1 Main article  Transformers  Generation One  Dreamwave  When they acquired the Transformers licence from Hasbro  Dreamwave Productions initially produced a six issue mini series  written by Chris Saccarini and drawn by company President Pat Lee  entitled Prime Directive  Despite mixed critical reaction and the late shipping of several issues  the series was a huge sales success  Encouraged by this  Dreamwave produced a second series  this time written by Brad Mick  called War and Peace  When the second series emulated the sales of the first  Dreamwave decided to upgrade the Generation One to an ongoing series focusing on the Earthbound Autobots and Decepticons  written by Brad Mick aka James McDonough and Adam Patyk  and drawn by Don Figueroa  although Lee and Joe Ng helped draw the preview issue  and issue  4 featured a back up story drawn by James Raiz   However  Dreamwave s eventual bankruptcy meant that the series would never be concluded past issue  10  It is notable that this is the first piece of Transformers fiction to use the term Generation One in the title  After Dreamwave s bankruptcy  the first two miniseries were redistributed in trade paperback form through IDW Publishing  Of note  there is a magazine that published a 10 page preview in b w of what was to have been the 11th issue of the series had Dreamwave not gone into bankruptcy  but was of a very low print run   edit  Transformers  The War Within Main article  Transformers  The War Within After the success of their Generation One series  Dreamwave decided to do a series focusing on the war on Cybertron before the Transformers came to Earth  and recruited Marvel Transformers writer Simon Furman and former fan artist Don Figueroa for a six issue series focusing on the rise of Optimus Prime  Later  a second volume appeared entitled The Dark Ages  again written by Furman and drawn by regular Marvel Transformers artist Andrew Wildman  The second volume is notable for introducing The Fallen  an outcast member of the original thirteen Transformers  A third volume  called The Age of Wrath  written by Furman and drawn by Joe Ng  was released up through issue  3  but due to Dreamwave s bankruptcy it was never completed  The first two series are due for re release in trade paperback form by IDW Publishing in March and May 2007   edit  Transformers  Micromasters Main article  Transformers  Micromasters Micromasters was a four issue mini series written by Brad Mick aka James McDonough and Adam Patyk and drawn by Rob Ruffolo  Set on Cybertron after the disappearance of the Ark  the series focused on the history of the titular Micromasters and the discovery of a mysterious Golden Disk with links to the origins of the Transformers  Despite some vocal readers  complaints regarding the series and its art  it also received its share of praise and sold well to the direct market  35  36   edit  Transformers  More Than Meets the Eye An eight issue limited series from 2003 written by Brad Mick aka James McDonough and Adam Patyk  the shapers of Dreamwave s G1 title and its overall Transformers continuity  with art by most of the Dreamwave artists  it featured bios of all the Transformers released as toys in the United States  with the exception of several of the Action Masters   The character entries were done in the same style as the 1986 Marvel limited series  Transformers Universe  with page long bios and art of the characters in both their robot and alternate forms  The character bios included expanded information from the original toys  tech specs  as well as new character development from the Dreamwave Transformers continuity  Issues one through seven contain the character bios  while issue number eight contains entries for key Transformer locations  ideas and technology  The first pages of issue one and the last pages of issue eight feature a mini comic about where all the information presented in the limited series is coming from  and who is accessing it  which was a prequel story to the Beast Wars television series  The series proved to be popular  and a subsequent More Than Meets The Eye miniseries debuted the next year  this time covering Transformers  Armada  However  in light of the comic s success  there was some negative reception by fans who felt that more biographies of characters in the Generation One cartoon series  more notably the female Autobots and Devcon  should have been added to the comics  In contrast  many characters from the 1986 movie  later added to the cartoon series  third season  were added  such as the Quintessons  their Sharkticons  and amphibious Allicons   edit  Armada Energon  edit  Transformers  Armada  2002 2003  Main article  Transformers  Armada  comics  This comic series was based on the new Transformers toyline of that year  Transformers  Armada  The continuity  while following elements from the cartoon series of the same name  was wholly its own continuity  Differences included the Mini Cons  ability to talk in a normal way rather than the beeps and boops from the cartoon series  Also  the resolution to the Armada saga was quite different and involved cross dimensional travel and several Generation 1 characters  The series ended at issue  18 and was retitled as Transformers  Energon with the following issue  Originally written by Sarracini  Simon Furman came onboard to do a 2 part filler story and ended up as the ongoing writer as a result  Issues 1 5  written by Chris Saccarini and drawn by James Raiz  would give some background to the original war on Cybertron  detailing how Megatron s campaign started on Cybertron and how the Mini Cons originally came to Earth  escaping Megatron s grasp  One million years later the arc would introduce the three main human characters  Rad  Alexis and Carlos  and see both sides battle and gain Mini Cons for the first time  Issues 6 7 would see Furman take over the scripting  with Pat Lee on art  detailing the discovery of several more Mini Con teams on Earth  Issues 8 11  with Guido Guidi taking over on art  would see the discovery of a mysterious Mini Con monolith that would assemble all the Mini Cons on a base on the moon  leading the Decepticons to attempt a full scale assault to capture them all  Issues 12 13 would see Megatron construct a superweapon  a powerful laser focusing satellite  in an attempt to destroy the Autobots  as well as capturing enough Mini Cons to overload Cyclonus s power  With the series coming to a close and Energon due to take over as the active franchise comic  issues 14 18 were dedicated to the coming of Unicron  with cameo appearances by several G1 characters  With Don Figueroa on art  it detailed the coming of the Heralds of Unicron into the Armada dimension to secure the Mini Con Matrix and kill all of Unicron s enemies  The arc introduced Jetfire and the concept of Powerlinking  as well as having a battle between Armada Megatron and G1 Galvatron  Unicron s chief Herald  The final issue  again drawn by Guidi  served as a bridge between the Armada and Energon series  detailing Unicron s defeat and Megatron s disappearance   edit  Transformers  Energon  2003 2004  Main article

Brad Mick aka James McDonough and Adam Patyk with art by many Dreamwave artists  including the interlocking covers by Joe Ng   the layout was similar to the Transformers  More Than Meets the Eye mini series released in 2003  and included separate character bios for the Minicons as well as for the other Transformers  The first pages of issue one and the last pages of issue three feature a mini comic of the human character Alexis studying the history of the Transformers  The comic was set sometime between the events of the Transformers  Armada and Transformers  Energon Dreamwave comics

The two evil forces conquered much of Europe in an alternative version of World War II  G I  Joe  here a group of American infantry men  find the Autobots who aid them in stopping both Cobra and the

operations  39  40  41  The story followed Transformers G I  Joe  but took place 40 years later in 1985  and was intended to have explained the connection to the first volume s story  42   edit  Transformers Summer Special The Transformers Summer Special was a one shot produced in the summer of 2004 that featured stories from Generation 1  Energon  Robots in Disguise  and Beast Wars  The latter two were put to a vote by fans  and the winner  Beast Wars  was to be the next Transformers comic series  see Beast Wars  Unreleased  and Beast Wars  IDW Publishing  Background for more information   The Summer Special was to be an annual mini series  but due to Dreamwave s bankruptcy only one issue was published  The Generation 1 segment  written by the main G1 creative team of Brad Mick aka James McDonough and Adam Patyk and drawn by Pat Lee and Joe Ng  focused on Megatron and the Predacons  The Predacons were once warlords on Cybertron who were cast into exile in space  Settling on Planet Beest   a homage to the Battle Beasts toy line   the Predacons sank into a feral state  and lived as inhabitants of that world for untold years  until Megatron arrived  Having been jettisoned into space by Starscream and restored from the brink of death by Wreck Gar  Megatron now had his sights set on reclaiming the Decepticon leadership  and required the Predacons to bolster his army  Abandoning his personal weaponry  Megatron pursued Razorclaw through the jungle and soundly defeated him in hand to hand combat  Subsequently  he re engineered the Predacons to give them the ability to combine into Predaking  This would later impact the ongoing Generation 1 comic when Megatron brought them to Cybertron to help defeat Shockwave and later to Earth  There were three other stories  including a Transformers  Energon tale written by Simon Furman and drawn by James Raiz  The tale focused on Slugslinger  Sharkticon and Snow Cat  who had been defeated in an assault by Omega Supreme  telling lies to Megatron in order to excuse their failure  Megatron eventually appoints Slugslinger as his lieutenant  as his lie was the most impressive  The other two  both written by Brad Mick aka James McDonough and Adam Patyk  focused around Beast Wars and Transformers  Robots in Disguise  The RiD tale  drawn by Rob Ruffolo  focused on Scourge and Sky Byte stealing a nuclear reactor  while Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus learn the value of teamwork to stop them  The Beast Wars tale  drawn by Don Figueroa  focused on Rattrap reminiscing on a time when he was attacked by Dinobot 2  only to be saved by a trio of mysterious Maximals   edit  Beast Wars  unreleased  In the Summer Special  a competition was run to choose whether the next Dreamwave Transformers series would be Beast Wars or Transformers  Robots in Disguise  Beast Wars won  and the Generation One team of writers James McDonough and Adam Patyk and artist Don Figueroa were slated as the creative team  43  However  Dreamwave s bankruptcy would mean that no issues were ever published  although images and issue synopses have appeared on the Internet  44  After McDonough and Patyk left Dreamwave due to the company s non payment  writer Simon Furman was added to the series with Figueroa  They would eventually become the creative team on IDW Publishing s Beast Wars series   edit  IDW Publishing After Dreamwave s collapse in the winter of 2004  Hasbro awarded the Transformers comic license to IDW Publishing the following spring with plans to relaunch the property  Two miniseries were initially planned  one featuring the Generation One characters and the other focusing on the Beast Wars  The success of these has led to several other projects as listed below  Long time Transformers writer Simon Furman was brought aboard and given the creative reigns over both series  as well as their spin offs  He took the opportunity to reboot the Generation One universe  going in a new direction from any previous incarnation  though retaining key elements such as character personalities and paint schemes   edit  Generation One Main article  The Transformers  IDW Publishing   edit  The Transformers
