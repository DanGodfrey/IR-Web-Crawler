settlement by Europeans  Georgia was inhabited by the mound building cultures  Georgia was originally formed into a trustee colony of England and was claimed and named for King George II  In 1742 the colony was invaded by the Spanish during the War of Jenkins  Ear  In 1752  after the government failed to renew subsidies that had helped support the colony  the Trustees turned over control to the crown  Georgia became a crown colony  with a governor appointed by the king  9  Battle of Kennesaw Mountain  June 27  1864  Province of Georgia was one of the Thirteen Colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution by signing the 1776 Declaration of Independence  After the war  Georgia became the fourth state of the Union after ratifying the Constitution on 2 January 1788  As of 2012  it is known as the  Commonwealth of Georgia   In 1829  gold was discovered in the north Georgia mountains  resulting in the Georgia Gold Rush leading to the establishment of a federal mint in Dahlonega that continued operation until 1861  The influx of white settlers put pressure on the government to take land from the Cherokee Nation  In 1830  the Indian Removal Act was signed into law  This resulting in sending all eastern native tribes to reservations in present day Oklahoma  Despite the Supreme Court s ruling in Worcester v  Georgia  that states were not permitted to redraw the Indian boundaries  President Andrew Jackson and the state of Georgia ignored the ruling  In 1838  his successor  Martin Van Buren dispatched federal troops to round up the Cherokee and deport them west of the Mississippi  This forced relocation  known as the Trail of Tears  led to the death of over 4 000 Cherokees  In early 1861  Georgia joined the Confederacy and became a major theater of the Civil War  Major battles took place at Chickamauga  Kennesaw Mountain  and Atlanta  In December 1864  a large swath of the state from Atlanta to Savannah was destroyed during General William Tecumseh Sherman s March to the Sea  In 1870  following reconstruction  Georgia became the last Confederate state restored to the Union  Broadcast television came to Atlanta area and northern  and upper central Georgia viewers on September 29  1948 with the debut of WSB TV  broadcasting on VHF channel 8   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of Georgia  U S  state   edit  Boundaries Beginning from the Atlantic Ocean  the state s eastern border with South Carolina runs up the Savannah River  northwest to its origin at the confluence of the Tugaloo and Seneca Rivers  It then continues up the Tugaloo  originally Tugalo  and into the Chattooga River  its most significant tributary  These bounds were decided in the 1797 Treaty of Beaufort  and tested in the U S  Supreme Court in the two Georgia v  South Carolina cases in 1923 and 1989  The border then takes a sharp turn around the tip of Rabun County  at latitude 35 N  though from this point it diverges slightly south  due to inaccuracies in the original survey   This originally was the Georgia and North Carolina border all the way back to the Mississippi River  until Tennessee was divided from North Carolina  and Alabama and Mississippi  the Yazoo lands  were taken from Georgia  clarification needed  The state s western border then departs in another straight line south southeastward  at a point southwest of Chattanooga  to meet the westernmost point of the Chattahoochee River near West Point  It continues down to the point where it ends at the Flint River  the confluence of the two forming Florida s Apalachicola River   and goes almost due east and very slightly south  in a straight line to the origin of the St  Mary s River  which then forms the remainder of the boundary back to the ocean  It should be noted that the water boundaries are still set to be the original thalweg of the rivers  Since then  several have been inundated by lakes created by dams  including the Apalachicola Chattahoochee Flint point now under Lake Seminole  Georgia state legislators have claimed that the state s border with Tennessee has been erroneously placed one mile  1 6 km  further south than intended in an 1818 survey  and in 2010 proposed that the border should be corrected  This would allow Georgia  then in the midst of a significant drought  to access water from the Tennessee River  10   edit  Geology and terrain Map of elevations in Georgia Main article  Geology of Georgia  U S  state  Each region has its own distinctive characteristics  For instance  the Ridge and Valley  which lies in the northwest corner of the state  includes limestone  sandstone  shale and other sedimentary rocks  which have yielded construction grade limestone  barite  ocher and small amounts of coal   edit  Flora and Fauna Main article  Ecology of Georgia  U S  state  Georgia has a diverse mix of flora and fauna  The state of Georgia has approximately 250 tree species and 58 protected plants  Georgia s native trees include red cedar  a variety of pines  oaks  maples  cypress  sweetgum and scaly bark and white hickories  as well as many others  Palmettos and other subtropical flora are found in the southern and coastal regions  Yellow jasmine  and mountain laurel make up just a few of the flowering shrubs in the state  White tailed  Virginia  deer are in nearly all counties  The northern mockingbird and Brown Thrasher are among the 160 bird species that live in the state  11  Reptiles include the eastern diamondback  copperhead  and cottonmouth  salamanders  frogs  alligators and toads  There are about 79 species of reptile and 63 amphibians known to live in Georgia  11  The most popular freshwater game fish are trout  bream  bass  and catfish  all but the last of which are produced in state hatcheries for restocking  Popular saltwater game fish include red drum  spotted seatrout  flounder  and tarpon  among many others  Porpoises  whales  shrimp  oysters  and blue crabs are found inshore and offshore of the Georgia coast  11   edit  Climate Main article  Climate of Georgia  U S  state  Image of March 1993 Storm of the Century covering the length of the east coast  The outline of Georgia is discernible in the center of the image  The majority of Georgia is primarily a humid subtropical climate  Hot and humid summers are typical  except at the highest elevations  The entire state  including the north Georgia mountains  receives moderate to heavy precipitation  which varies from 45 inches  1143 mm  in central Georgia 12  to approximately 75 inches  1905 mm  around the northeast part of the state  13  The degree to which the weather of a certain region of Georgia is subtropical depends on the latitude  its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico and the elevation  The latter factor is felt chiefly in the mountainous areas of the northern part of the state  which are farther away from the ocean and can be 4500 feet  1350 m  above sea level  The USDA Plant hardiness zones for Georgia range from zone 6b  no colder than  5  F   21  C    in the Blue Ridge Mountains to zone 8b  no colder than 15  F   9  C    along the Atlantic coast and Florida border  14  The highest temperature ever recorded is 112  F  44 4  C  at Louisville on July 24  1952  15  while the lowest is  17  F   27 2  C  at northern Floyd County on January 27  1940  16  Georgia is one of the leading states in frequency of tornadoes  though they rarely are stronger than F1  A tornado hit downtown Atlanta on March 14  2008  causing moderate to severe damage  With a coastline on the Atlantic Ocean  Georgia is also vulnerable to hurricanes  although direct hurricane strikes were rare during the 20th century  Georgia often is affected by hurricanes that strike

687 653 18 3  Sources  1910 2010 18  The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Georgia was 9 815 210 on July 1  2011  a 1 32  increase since the 2010 United States Census  1  In 2007  Georgia had an estimated population of 9 544 750 which was an increase of 180 809 from the previous year  and an increase of 1 177 125 since 2000  This includes a natural increase since the last census of 438 939 people  that is 849 414 births minus 410 475 deaths  and an increase from net migration of 606 673 people into the state  Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 228 415 people  and migration within the country produced a net increase of 378 258 people  The state stood sixth in the country for illegal immigrants  There were 35 000 in 1990  the count more than doubled from January 2000 to January 2009  at 480 000  19  There were 743 000 veterans in 2009  20   edit  Race  language and age A map of Georgia  detailing the population density and distribution  According to the 2010 U S  Census  Georgia had a population of 9 687 653  In terms of race and ethnicity  the state was 59 7  White  55 9  Non Hispanic White Alone   30 5  Black or African American  0 3  American Indian and Alaska Native  3 2  Asian  0 1  Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander  4 0  from Some Other Race  and 2 1  from Two or More Races  Hispanics and Latinos of any race made up 8 8  of the population  21  The largest ancestry groups are  10 8  American  mostly British descent   9 5  Irish  8 9  English and 8 2  German  22  In the 1980 census 1 584 303 Georgians cited that they were of English ancestry out of a total state population of 3 994 817 making them 40  of the state  and the largest ethnic group at the time  23  Today  many of these same people cite that they are of  American  ancestry are actually of English descent and some are of Scots Irish descent  however they have families that have been in the state so long  in many cases since the colonial period  that they choose to identify simply as having  American  ancestry or do not in fact know their own ancestry  Their ancestry primarily goes back to the original thirteen colonies and for this reason many of them today simply claim  American  ancestry  though they are of predominately English ancestry  24  25  26  27  As of 2005  90  of Georgia residents age 5 and older speak only English at home and 5 6  speak Spanish  French is the third most spoken language at 0 9   followed by German at 0 8  and Vietnamese at 0 6   As of 2004  7 7  of its population was reported as under 5 years of age  26 4  under 18  and 9 6  were 65 or older  Also as of 2004  females made up approximately 50 6  of the population and African Americans made up approximately 29 6   Historically  about half of Georgia s population was composed of African Americans who  prior to the Civil War  were almost exclusively enslaved  The Great Migration of hundreds of thousands of blacks from the rural South to the industrial North from 1914 1970 reduced the African American population  28  Georgia had the second fastest growing Asian population growth in the U S  from 1990 to 2000  more than doubling in size during the ten year period  29  In addition  according to census estimates  Georgia ranks third among the states in terms of the percent of the total population that is African American  after Mississippi and Louisiana  and third in numerical Black population after New York and Florida  Georgia was the state with the largest numerical increase in the black population from 2006 to 2007 with 84 000  Georgia is the state with the third lowest percentage of older people  65 or older   at 10 1 percent  as of 2008   30  The colonial settlement of large numbers of Scottish American  English American and Scotch Irish Americans in the mountains and piedmont  and coastal settlement by some English Americans and African Americans  have strongly influenced the state s culture in food  language and music  The concentration of Africans imported to coastal areas in the 18th century repeatedly from rice growing regions of West Africa led to the development of Gullah Geechee language and culture in the Low Country among African Americans  They share a unique heritage in which African traditions of food  religion and culture were continued more than in some other areas  In the creolization of Southern culture  their foodways became an integral part of all Southern cooking in the Low Country  31   edit  Religion The Al Farooq Masjid Mosque of Atlanta  Georgia Like most other Southern states  Georgia is largely Protestant Christian  The religious affiliations of the people of Georgia are as follows  32  Protestant  70  Baptist  24  Methodist  12  Presbyterian  3  Pentecostal  3  Catholic  12  Other  3  Non religious  13  The largest Christian denominations by number of adherents in 2000 were the Southern Baptist Convention with 1 719 484  the United Methodist Church with 570 674  and the Catholic Church with 374 185  33   edit  Government Main article  Government of Georgia  U S  state   edit  State government See also  List of governors of Georgia and Georgia elected officials The Georgia State Capitol Building in Atlanta with the distinctive gold dome  The capital of Georgia is Atlanta  As with all other U S  states and the federal government  Georgia s government is based on the separation of legislative  executive and judicial power  34  Executive authority in the state rests with the governor  currently Nathan Deal  Republican    See List of Governors of Georgia   Both the governor and lieutenant governor are elected on separate ballots to four year terms of office  Unlike the federal government  but like many other U S  States  most of the executive officials who comprise the governor s cabinet are elected by the citizens of Georgia rather than appointed by the governor  Legislative authority resides in the General Assembly  composed of the Senate and House of Representatives  The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate  while the House of Representatives selects their own Speaker  The Georgia Constitution mandates a maximum of 56 senators  elected from single member districts  and a minimum of 180 representatives  apportioned among representative districts  which sometimes results in more than one representative per district   there are currently 56 senators and 180 representatives  The term of office for senators and representatives is two years  35  State judicial authority rests with the state Supreme Court and Court of Appeals  which have statewide authority  36  In addition  there are smaller courts which have more limited geographical jurisdiction  including State Courts  Superior Courts  Magistrate Courts and Probate Courts  Justices of the Supreme Court and judges of the Court of Appeals are elected statewide by the citizens in non partisan elections to six year terms  Judges for the smaller courts are elected by the state s citizens who live within that court s jurisdiction to four year terms   edit  Local government Georgia consists of 159 counties  more than any other state except Texas  which consists of 254 counties  37  Georgia had 161 counties until the end of 1931  when Milton and Campbell were merged into Fulton  Counties have been named for prominent figures in both American and Georgian history  but many bear names with Native American origin  Counties in Georgia have their own elected legislative branch  usually called the Board of Commissioners  which usually also has executive authority in the county  38  Several counties have a Sole Commissioner government  with legislative and executive authority vested in a single person  Georgia is the only state with Sole Commissioner counties  Georgia s Constitution provides all counties and cities with  home rule  authority  and so the county commissions have considerable power to pass legislation within their county as a municipality would  Further information  list of Georgia counties Besides the counties  Georgia only defines cities as local units of government  Every

Wallace of the American Independent Party  at 42 83   or 535 550 votes Until recently  Georgia s state government had the longest unbroken record of single party dominance  by the Democratic Party  of any state in the Union  This record was established partly by disfranchisement of most blacks and many poor whites in the early 20th century  lasting into the 1960s  After Reconstruction  white Democrats regained power  especially by legal disfranchisement of most African Americans and many poor whites through erection of barriers to voter registration  In 1900  shortly before Georgia adopted a disfranchising constitutional amendment in 1908  blacks comprised 47  of the state s population  39  A  clean  franchise was linked by Progressives to electoral reform  40  White  one party rule was solidified  For over 130 years  from 1872 to 2003  Georgians nominated and elected only white Democratic governors  and white Democrats held the majority of seats in the General Assembly  Most of the Democrats elected throughout these years were Southern Democrats or Dixiecrats  who were very conservative by national standards  This continued after the segregationist period  which was ended by court orders in the 1960s  According to the 1960 census  the proportion of Georgia s population that was African American had decreased to 28   41  After a Democratic controlled Congress passed civil rights legislation to secure voting and civil rights in the mid 1960s  most African Americans in the South joined the Democratic Party  Progress in civil rights was demonstrated with the election of former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter in 1976 to the U S  Presidency  The political dominance of Democrats ended in 2003  when then Governor Roy Barnes was defeated by Republican Sonny Perdue  a state legislator and former Democrat himself  While Democrats retained control of the State House  they lost their majority in the Senate when four Democrats switched parties  They lost the House in the 2004 election  Republicans now control all three partisan elements of the state government  Even before 2003  the state had become increasingly supportive of Republicans in Presidential elections  It has supported a Democrat for president only three times since 1960  In 1976 and 1980  native son Jimmy Carter carried the state  in 1992  the former Arkansas governor Bill Clinton narrowly won the state  Generally  Republicans are strongest in the predominantly white suburban  especially the Atlanta suburbs  and rural portions of the state  42  Many of these areas were represented by conservative Democrats in the state legislature well into the 21st century  One of the most conservative of these was U S  Congressman Larry McDonald  former head of the John Birch
